mexico has recorded its lowest inflation rate 
in a decade and junes 12 percent increase in consumer prices put 
the 12month inflation rate at 176 percent the bank of mexico 
reports 
inflation hit an alltime high of 1592 percent in 1987 then 
dropped to 517 percent in 1988 
junes was the lowest increase in the consumer price index since 
july 1979 and brought inflation for the six months ending june 30 to 
93 percent 
it was also the lowest for a first semester since 1978 when 
prices rose by an average of 84 percent the bank said sunday in 
its monthly report 
economists tie the sharp drop in inflation to a government 
agreement with labor and management instituted in late 1987 that 
freezes wages and prices for an average of six months at a time and 
keeps increases at a minimum 
during the last round of talks all three sides agreed july 1 to 
raise the minimum wage by an average of 65 percent nationwide and 
continue the program until next march with another round of 
negotiations in december

the soviet union could accept bush 
administration proposals for trial inspections of nuclear weapons 
systems as long as more weapons are covered and would consider 
limits on multiwarhead mobile missiles the chief soviet arms 
control spokesman is quoted as saying 
deputy foreign minister viktor karpov in a moscow interview 
reported in tuesday editions of the washington post said such 
inspections should not prevent the normal development of 
negotiations in geneva or be a precondition for work on the draft 
text and protocols they should go hand in hand 
but karpov said the soviets want to include more weapons systems 
than were envisioned in the us proposal put forward in the start 
strategic arms reduction talks negotiations in geneva last month 
for monitoring experiments while the talks are under way 
us officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experiments 
to silobased missiles and mobile strategic missiles karpov 
however was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber bases 
should be included 
the first monitoring should be of sealaunched cruise missiles 
one of the areas where the most difficult verification problems 
arise he said he suggested inspectors might visit each others 
cruise missile factories 
though the united states proposed continuous monitoring of 
entrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles 
it has no such plants of its own 
however the bush administration has proposed to put the 
10warhead mx missile on rail cars and the proposed singlewarhead 
midgetman on mobile land transporters 
karpov said if we can have inspectors at production plants for 
the mx or the midgetman then we would be ready to have such a team 
at our plant producing the multiwarhead ss24 a mobile missile 
asked if the soviets would consider banning or sharply limiting 
such missiles karpov said i think that can be considered 
he said the soviet union might also accept a ban on nuclear 
cruise missiles of any range instead of numerical limits on the 
longrange strategic variety it has put forward if we can find 
efficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclear 
weapons in a way that wont harm us and soviet security 
interests

thirtyeight years ago charles tasnadi left 
his native hungary on his belly scrabbling a tortuous path to 
freedom through frozen minefields and waves of barbed wire he will 
return tuesday on air force one 
as george bush pays the first visit to budapest by an american 
president tasnadi 64 an associated press photographer will be 
with him to capture that moment on film he will record an even more 
special moment in his heart 
when the military band strikes up the star spangled banner 
during the arrival ceremonies at the kossuth statue a monument to 
the hungarian hero who fought the hapsburgs in budapest i will 
remember a small boy scout standing at that same statue he said 
and i will also remember that following world war ii my church 
choir was forbidden by the stalinist puppet regime to sing the 
us national anthem to thank america for its postwar help 
tasnadi was just shy of his 26th birthday when he and his 
sweetheart maria seized upon the first heavy snowfall of the 
195051 winter to seek a new life a championship skier he 
concocted a story about heading for the slopes sharing the truth 
only with his mother who by design would report him missing two 
days later 
joining a group of six other adults and two children one of 
whom tasnadi carried on his shoulders during the final nightlong 
leg across the border the couple slipped into austria eluded more 
soviet guards in the 50mile soviet zone of that nation and made it 
to salzburg several days later 
they nearly didnt the other child carried by another man had 
to be knocked unconscious to keep it from crying and alerting the 
guards and it was so miserably cold tasnadi recalls twice i 
fell through the ice up to my chest i couldnt even feel it when 
we got to a house on the austrian side i kicked off my brand new 
shoes so they would dry out when i woke up they were so shriveled 
up i couldnt use them 
he and maria were quickly married in salzburg but their dream of 
raising a family in the united states was at first stymied by 
immigration authorities so they moved to venezuela instead where 
tasnadis newspaper photography eventually drew the aps attention 
and an invitation to join the news service in the united states he 
was assigned to the washington bureau in 1964 and has worked there 
since 
twice over the years maria has returned to hungary but tasnadi 
torn by conflicting emotions kept postponing the trip his mother 
now deceased had long since emigrated to the united states i 
finally said ok this is the year i go he said then it 
wasnt two weeks before i got the assignment to go with the 
president of the united states maria will stay behind 
prior assignment have taken him to the soviet union cuba and 
other communist nations and the castro government has accorded him 
several unusual photo privileges out of respect for his work 
since i became an american citizens i try to be very polite to 
the soviet bloc he said i want to be sure of my objectivity 
ive never tried to make a bad picture of any communist leader 
the only time i talk politics is when i vote 
but tasnadis love of the united states is legion among 
washington circles an american flag adorns his mailbox and despite 
his courtly manners he will fight you if you say anything bad 
about his country or his flag says toby massey washington 
assistant chief of bureau for newsphotos 
massey recalled that when tasnadi was about to take his 
citizenship test in 1968 charlie was a nervous wreck he studied 
so hard and had everybody giving him spot quizzes another ap 
photographer henry burroughs accompanied tasnadi to the courtroom 
as his sponsor as it turned out said massey the judge was a 
college roommate of burroughs and didnt ask tasnadi a single 
question 
other anecdotes abound about the americanization of tasnadi when 
he was first assigned to cover a baseball game he quickly surmised 
that the best action occurred around second base so he promptly 
walked onto the field and took his position just feet from the bag 
at a professional football game a perplexed tasnadi kept 
glancing skyward as he paced the sidelines when a colleague asked 
him why tasnadi pointed to the ball on section of the 
scoreboard and said i cant find the balloon 
and during a national political convention tasnadis assignment 
editor ordered him to relieve a colleague ray stubblebine who had 
taken ill on one of the photo towers in the hall go over there 
and spell stubblebine the editor demanded tasnadi didnt move 
damn it charlie i said go over there and spell stubblebine 
the editor barked 
im sorry said tasnadi if i cant spell it here i cant 
spell it over there 
professionally tasnadi gets most things right he was won 
several white house press photographers awards and counts several 
presidents among his friends once in vail colo he got a knock 
on his door at 2 am mr tasnadi said his caller the 
president would be honored if you could ski with him tomorrow 
riding up the chairlift with gerald r ford tasnadi recalled 
i thought my god if anybody would have told me when i was 
waiting with that little boy in my arms to cross that minefield 
that one day i would be riding up a mountain with the president of 
the united states oh my god 
despite the trend toward more political tolerance in hungary 
tasnadi still confesses some apprehension about his emotional 
readiness for his first return to his homeland my worst fear 
he said tears welling in his eyes is an evening at an old 
restaurant in budapest with a glass of tokay served to the strains 
of violins that could prove to be disastrous 
asked what picture he would like to shoot most in hungary he 
replied there are so many but when i see that statue of lajos 
kossuth before the war i was chosen as one of two little boy 
scouts who would go there on weekends and stand at attention for two 
hours as honor guard and now the president will go there when i 
see that statue again 
his tears finished the sentence

sunbathers on italys adriatic coast can stay in the 
sun but may well have to keep out of the water due to an explosion 
of thick slimy algae 
last august the algae growth prompted authorities to call 
bathing uninviting this july theyre calling it potentially 
dangerous 
authorities in the romagna region which includes popular seaside 
resorts such as rimini on saturday called bathing impractical 
and urge tourists to wait for the results of an algae analysis due 
today 
if the tests confirm that the waters are dangerous bathing will 
be banned tourism officials said 
last year the algae invaded italys northern adriatic coast 
scaring away tourists and killing fish the algae thrive on raw 
sewage and chemical pollutants that dirty the italian waters 
an official prohibition on bathing could deal a heavy blow to the 
tourism industry

crews chip away old paint and hack at 
kneehigh weeds at the abandoned chilocco indian school seemingly 
unaffected by the tempest brewing in this remote corner of oklahoma 
when a california group received state permission for a 75bed 
drug and alcohol treatment center newkirk thought the project on 
the reservation six miles away would solve local economic troubles 
brought on by oil and farming slumps 
but the initial euphoria like the old paint has chipped away 
replaced by distrust frustration even fear 
townspeople say narconon international hasnt been honest about 
its affiliation with the church of scientology its financing its 
medical credentials and its plans for the project which will draw 
mostly outofstate clients 
they say narconon denied the project had anything to do with 
scientology until newkirk officials turned up a scientology magazine 
with a story headlined trained scientologists to staff huge 
oklahoma facility 
and the mayor says narconon tried to dupe locals at a staged 
ceremony where a 200000 check and a glowing study were presented 
to narconon by a group that turned out to be part of narconon itself 
now the town fears it could earn a cult image because of the 
projects ties to scientology which follows the teachings of the 
late science fiction writer l ron hubbard former members have 
accused scientology of fraud and mental abuse and the internal 
revenue service has challenged its taxexempt status as a religion 
people interested in coming to this town will see the church of 
scientology thing the cult thing and i think that that image 
will hurt our possibilities for growth and development mayor 
garry bilger said in an interview last month 
some townspeople say they worry about the kind of people the 
project will attract and that the stately 80building campus built 
of native oklahoma stone and tucked more than a mile off the nearest 
road will become a scientology recruiting station 
i dont think any of us are against drug abusers getting 
rehabilitation said mike clifton pastor of the first christian 
church but theres a lot of concern in the community because we 
really dont know what these folks are exactly about what really 
worries us is what theyre not saying 
in the basement of the first baptist church pastor mark jones is 
making copies of a videotape of a british broadcasting corp 
documentary on scientology which he showed to his congregation at a 
worship service 
the tapes along with scientology literature have been 
circulating in this town of 2400 there have been town meetings and 
public forums including a sometimes heated session with state 
officials who approved the narconon project before the town knew it 
was supported by scientology 
the town got the shaft said insurance agent charles 
eisenhauer i dont think anybody can undo anything thats been 
done so far the center is scheduled to open in september 
narconon officials say newkirks concern is inflated and 
unwarranted narconon is a legitimate worldwide drug and alcohol 
rehabilitation program with 23 years experience and an 86 percent 
success rate they assert 
narconon spokesman gary smith said he tried to reassure the town 
that narconons sole intention is to get people off drugs he 
said the town has been misled 
theres fear being put into the town by false information being 
fed in there by somebody whos in favor of drug abuse theyre 
either connected to selling drugs or theyre using drugs smith 
said 
smith declined to be more specific about the identity or 
whereabouts of these outside sources with criminal motives 
trust me i know he said 
another narconon attempt at persuasion provoked an angry response 
in a letter printed may 18 on the front page of the weekly 
newkirk herald journal narconon president john duff wrote there 
will be those that will not want narconon to succeed at chilocco 
because they are for drugs and are on the other side in the battle 
against drugs 
jones the baptist minister responded the following week 
writing he resented the implication or more accurately the 
accusation that was made by narconons mr duff he accused me of 
supporting illegal drug use in our area if i did not swallow his 
program hook line and sinker 
bilger said he had been so optimistic about the promise of a 
revitalized chilocco that last december he wrote oklahoma health 
officials supporting narconon 
but the mayor said his winter hope turned to disillusionment by 
spring when he learned of narconons history and he came to believe 
he had been misled when narconon held an emotional ceremony april 8 
in which the association for better living and education presented a 
glowing study of narconon and the 200000 check 
later bilger learned that able shared a street address in los 
angeles with narconon and is identified in a scientology magazine 
as part of narconon 
they totally misrepresented what was going on bilger said 
i came away with the impression that we had an independent 
group here interested in mankind and they had researched the 
narconon process then i find out able and narconon are part of the 
same organization he said 
i try to be straightforward and when somebody dosnt do that 
i wonder why 
in late june narconons smith used a copy of bilgers december 
letter of support to suggest to the associated press that the mayor 
supported narconon 
bilger says the december letter no longer reflects his feelings 
i imagine if i was in his shoes id use it too bilger said 
i just think now it narconon is a problem and if all the facts 
were out at the time things might have been done differently 
the chilocco indian school closed in 1980 and was declared 
surplus property by the bureau of indian affairs which turned 
control over to five indian tribes ponca kaw pawnee 
otoemissouria and tonkawa 
last year narconon invited representatives of tribes throughout 
the country to a meeting in clearwater fla narconon touted its 
program and said it was looking for a site for a treatment center 
currently narconons only us inpatient center is a los angeles 
clinic with 12 beds 
a ponca representative told narconon about the chilocco site the 
25year lease eventually drawn up offers the tribes a percentage of 
gross earnings up to 16 million the tribal leadership remains 
enthusiastic about the narconon project 
in january the oklahoma health planning commission gave narconon 
approval for an initial 75 beds the group seeks 150 beds with 
growth projected to 400 
robert lobsinger publisher of the weekly herald journal was by 
then becoming curious about narconon in newkirks tiny library he 
found articles about ties to scientology and past runins with 
officials his first story published april 27 under the headline 
chilocco drug treatment center may be part of notorious religious 
cult set the town abuzz 
townspeople said they have repeatedly asked narconon what medical 
credentials they have and so far have received no answer 
my first question is do they think that everyone down here is 
stupid said jones people around here are not world travelers 
but theyve got a lot of common sense and they ask a lot of 
questions 
weve encountered deceit from the beginning he said there 
have been smoke screens everywhere and there have been flatout 
lies

new orleans before augusts convention was trained to get along in 
crowds of people 
we started by taking her out when the zoo wasnt open 
holston said then we took her around to be with people 
by the end of august shed been on three television networks 
morning shows had been presented to thenpresident reagan and vice 
president bush and invited to countless soirees

he was one of professional footballs mightiest 
men a 295pound monster who could bench press twice his weight 
now steve courson is thrilled to lift 15pound dumbbells and climb 
a flight of stairs 
the former offensive lineman now only 33 years old suffers from 
cardiomyopathy a mysterious disease that turns heart muscle into 
flab and eventually kills its victims unless they undergo a 
transplant 
though his doctors cant blame coursons condition on his long 
heavy use of anabolic steroids they cant rule it out neither can 
he 
there are so many ironies about my situation thats why i 
cant discard them as being an accident why is all this ironically 
happening to me ive had two strikes strike three youre out 
courson formerly of the pittsburgh steelers and tampa bay 
buccaneers is believed to be the first professional athlete to be 
put on the waiting list for a heart transplant after years of taking 
illegally obtained anabolic steroids 
experts fear more may follow 
i wouldnt be surprised i think its going to happen said 
transplant pioneer dr thomas e starzl of the university of 
pittsburgh it might be liver disease that comes out of those 
things too 
the potential health hazard and the impact on the national 
health care system its very frightening said harvard 
universitys dr lyle micheli president of the american college of 
sports medicine 
it also raises an ethical question for transplant surgeons with 
a scarcity of organs should people who take harmful drugs be given 
lower priority 
anabolic steroids fast becoming the scourge of sports are 
derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone they stimulate 
development of bone muscle and skin admitted users include 
canadian sprinter ben johnson whose 1988 olympics gold medal was 
withdrawn after he tested positive for the drugs 
courson first took anabolic steroids in 1974 before his sophomore 
year at the university of south carolina in four weeks he went 
from 230 pounds to a solid 260 he continued the offseason habit 
after being drafted by the steelers in 1977 and playing on two super 
bowl teams 
not long after being traded to the buccaneers in 1984 courson 
boasted a 60inch chest and 22inch biceps and was pressing up to 
605 pounds anyone whos trained with weights or trained that 
seriously at worldclass level realizes those types of gains dont 
occur by eating wheaties 
at one point courson was shelling out 1500 a year for 
steroids not that big a tradeoff when youre making 300000 a 
year he said 
in march 1985 in the midst of an 1800 milligramaweek regimen 
his highest ever buccaneers doctors told him he had an irregular 
heartbeat the problem cleared up in two weeks with medication and 
courson quit taking steroids for the next year 
at the end of the 1985 season courson lost his starting job he 
took his last dose of anabolic steroids before the buccaneers 
training camp in 1986 in hopes of getting off the bench i wanted 
to maintain a competitive edge and i realize it had to do with my 
age too the wear and tear on the body 
courson was waived at the start of the season got no other 
offers and retired he lived in wyoming and florida then returned 
to the pittsburgh area in early 1988 to finish his autobiography and 
train as a professional wrestler 
on nov 23 1988 courson went to allegheny general hospital for 
what he thought was an ulcer it turned out to be cardiomyopathy 
for years doctors have warned of the immediate side effects of 
steroids acne sexual dysfunction rashes and unusually aggressive 
behavior known in the trade as roid rage less is known about 
longterm effects although animal tests suggest the drugs 
accelerate cardiovascular disease 
anybody whos used steroids and has any malady its 
immediately assumed steroids caused it we havent even done those 
studies yet said dr charles yesalis of pennsylvania state 
university 
we dont know frankly what is the bottom line said dr 
judith orie coursons cardiologist but we do know anabolic 
steroids cause high blood pressure in patients high blood pressure 
after a point in time causes the heart to fail 
also steroids can alter the immune system we dont know 
whether that has played a role and allowed a virus to affect his 
heart or not orie said 
complicating matters is the fact that doctors dont always know 
what causes cardiomyopathy 
there are many people who have cardiomyopathy and had nothing 
to do with steroids said dr barry maron of the national 
institutes of health thats the problem there is in establishing 
a connection in this one person its a very iffy kind of thing 
although im not saying its impossible 
about 40 percent of all heart transplants are performed on 
cardiomyopathy patients said dr michael kaye of the university of 
california at san diego who keeps the international registry of 
heart heartlung and lung transplants which stood at 11181 in 
late june the vast majority 10154 were straight heart 
transplants 
there were 1223 people awaiting heart transplants in the united 
states as of june 26 according to the united network for organ 
sharing 
the transplant community is concerned about steroids because 
of the tremendous need for organs and lack of donors kaye said 
courson who has been on the list since march 31 could wait a 
long time because of his body size doctors give him two years 
without a transplant 
experimental heart medication has enabled the 6foot1 courson 
to go from an alltime adult low of 225 pounds late last year to 255 
pounds it has also allowed him to stay in shape by walking 
treadmills and lifting light weights three times a week at allegheny 
generals cardiac rehabilitation laboratory 
because of the scarcity of organs some people quietly wonder 
whether former steroid users should get the same priority as 
individuals who never took illicit drugs transplant doctors 
however say they merely take into account patients current 
lifestyles and ability to maintain healthy habits 
cigarette smokers and alcoholics for instance usually are told 
they must stop before they can be considered for transplantation 
thats no guarantee however that they will stop for good 
arthur mcdonald sr 53 of schenectady ny ended a 30year 
cigarette habit before being put on the heart transplant waiting 
list at presbyterianuniversity hospital of pittsburgh about a year 
after his 1985 transplant he was smoking again he says he plans to 
quit as soon as he loses 30 more pounds 
they werent very happy im not happy with myself he said 
youve got a second chance at life and the cigarettes arent going 
to add to it 
doctors say they extract a promise and hope for the best 
we really need that commitment starzl said but just 
because someone drank in the past just because steve courson once 
took steroids so he could compete i dont believe should be 
determining factors 
i think hes been punished plenty 
courson feels no shame or guilt being on the waiting list 
everyones got their faults but when you were doing something 
that you got paid for and was glorified are you totally to be 
blamed

i woke up this morning after a night of killing pain 
i went to the practice field to deal with it again 
my coach he tells me fight hard and be a man 
but with his chalk board theories we all wonder if he can 
so knock em down block em hard and strive to win the fight 
i wonder why theyre so concerned is it economic plight 
the battle in the trenches won and lost and who does realize 
but the gladiator in its midst whose soul in anguish cries 
the battle fought the game is won and victor duly glorified 
but the sad fact businessman is the sporting soul has died 
in the end in retrospect whats glorified and gained

samuel f pickering jr is not above telling 
a lie to make a good story better and he encourages the students in 
his writing course to do the same 
youve got to lie to give the illusion of truth the english 
professor tells his students at the university of connecticut 
given that philosophy its not surprising that pickering finds 
himself caught up in the excitement over a bit of fiction written by 
a former student the teacher john keating played by robin williams 
in the movie dead poets society is modeled after pickering 
like keating pickering has been known to do the unusual in his 
classroom hes lectured from a desktop from outside a window or 
while wearing wastepaper baskets on his feet he also returned to 
his prep school as a young teacher after studying in england but 
unlike the movie there was never any conflict between pickering and 
school administrators and he left the school on good terms 
whatever of me is in that character has got to be small the 
47yearold pickering said during recent interview at his home i 
was a kid and he was a child twentythree years ago how much of me 
could there be in the movie not very much 
the screenplay was written by tom schulman who was a 15yearold 
student at montgomery bell academy in nashville tenn when he took 
a course from pickering pickering who had returned to the united 
states after a year of study at cambridge university taught at the 
private school for just one year 196566 
schulman has acknowledged pickerings influence on his life and 
the screenplay and has said much of his love for language and 
literature originated in that course 
pickering hasnt seen the movie his three children were sick 
and now hes in canada for the summer but many of his friends in 
nashville have seen the film and they immediately recognized 
pickering as the inspiration for the movies teacher the friends 
began talking and soon the news media picked up on the subject 
i dont mind being the center of attention if i can control it 
but i cant control this he said of the numerous inquiries hes 
received from reporters and acquaintances 
pickering who was born and raised in nashville is puzzled as to 
why he had so much influence on a former student and how it was that 
his friends so readily saw him in the movie hes also flattered 
im the most ordinary guy in the world he said as he draped 
his leg over the arm of a chair and picked at a hole in the knee of 
his jeans sometimes people remember me and i dont know why i 
dont know if i did anything special then as a teacher i was young 
and lively 
what he does in class is unplanned he said he does many unusual 
things to get his students to think for themselves but a bad back 
has forced him to abandon such acrobatics as desktop lectures his 
classroom is also on the second floor now making the leaps from 
windows unwise 
sometimes you get bored in the classroom he said this 
semester when my class was over the last class two girls in my 
class jumped up and gave an imitation of me right in front of the 
class they got as youd think they might get fs but ive 
learned since 
pickering bursts into laughter after telling the story he laughs 
often and easily as he recalls the past he finds many things 
humorous in life and often downplays his own accomplishments 
since leaving montgomery bell academy he has completed a 
doctorate and taught in syria and jordon and at dartmouth college 
hes been at the university of connecticut since 1978 where in 
addition to teaching hes become wellknown as an essayist 
he writes about his three children his wife his mother and 
father and ordinary things in life his writing as might be 
expected is humorous and selfcritical but also bawdy and 
philosophical he has published three books of his essays and is 
working on a fourth he plans to write an essay on the celebrity 
that has come to him in the wake of dead poets society 
his most recent book may days university of iowa 1988 
includes an essay on montgomery bell academy it pokes fun at the 
idea of a southern gentleman and pickerings exploits as a 
student athlete and practical joker 
from these experiences pickering has shaped a teaching 
philosophy that has in turn influenced many others 
there are very few givens that i accept i dont reject any 
either but i think that kids ought to start looking pickering 
said when somebody says its green then you should turn around 
and say maybe its not green whats the truth thats all i do

president carlos salinas de gortari broke 
tradition at the beginning of his term he made no dramatic 
announcement about fighting corruption in mexicos government and 
business 
to the astonishment of cynics he took action instead jailing 
oil union leaders stockbrokers and dozens of drugrunning police on 
corruption charges 
but his message hasnt penetrated mexicos bureaucracy where a 
bribe still can be expected to renew a visa obtain a trade permit 
or connect a telephone line 
now theres confusion said one business analyst people 
believe salinas people are clean but theyre still dealing with 
some of the same middlelevel officials they dont know what to 
do 
for most public servants the opportunity to earn a decent wage 
comes once in a lifetime with no career civil service and no merit 
system guaranteeing promotions tens of thousands lose their jobs at 
each change of administration 
while padding slim government incomes is not unique to mexico 
under the authoritarian system that has governed the country since 
before the time of the spanish conquest corruption spread well 
beyond the economic arena 
it has hurt the nations pride tarnished elections and in some 
instances claimed lives an internal government study estimated that 
federal highway police bribes cost the economy 3 million a day 
the authoritarian nature of government lends itself to 
corruption said samuel del villar an adviser to former president 
miguel de la madrid and political scientist at the colegio de 
mexico without accountability to the people officials enjoy the 
discretional authority to impose bribes and arbitrary fees 
salinas inaugurated dec 1 inherited a monumental task from de 
la madrid who took office in 1982 amid growing perception that 
corruption fed by the sudden wealth to be had in the oilboom 
years was out of control and had infected the private sector 
to get the commerce department to authorize a price increase 
for a product used to mean leaving an envelope behind said the 
business analyst who spoke only on condition of anonymity youd 
take up a collection from other businesses before you went 
de la madrid decreed a law prepared by del villar and a team of 
legal experts that extended criminal liability for corrupt 
practices by public servants it was the heart of de la madrids 
moral renovation campaign against corruption and it failed 
moral renovation failed because no one bothered to apply the 
public servants law del villar said indictments were 
discretional and in this case no one wanted to do it 
salinas abandoned moral renovation and ordered the arrests 
that so far have netted joaquin hernandez galicia the longtime 
chief of the powerful oil workers union eduardo legoretta a top 
businessman charged with stock market fraud and dozens of police 
agents in northwestern mexico alleged to have closed their eyes to 
drug trafficking 
salinas attorney general on april 27 ordered the arrest of 
carlos robles loustaunau who stepped down as mayor of hermosillo 
and three aides on charges of getting themselves elected last july 
through fraud they are members of salinas own institutional 
revolutionary party commonly known as pri its spanish initials 
taking their cue from salinas and his drive to modernize mexicos 
economy some mexican business leaders have openly attacked official 
bribetaking 
we are tired of corruption jorge ocejo moreno president of 
the national association of industries in transformation declared 
in april 
treasury health commerce and other federal department officials 
extort us without end he asserted 
to salinas both bureaucrats and private sector leaders are to 
blame for corruption that saps the economy and his own plans to 
generate growth 
salinas has promised measures to crack down on police corruption 
and to professionalize mexicos police forces 
as budget director under de la madrid salinas helped change the 
system of import licenses that encouraged corruption other 
deregulatory changes have also helped reduce the number of rules 
that can lead to extortion or bribery 
salinas also has laid down the law on chronic tax evasion by 
decreeing a 2 percent tax on business assets vociferous business 
protests have been largely ignored 
even so the roll call of corruption in mexico remains long and 
varied 
proud host of the 1986 world cup soccer championship mexico 
wont field a team in the 1990 games it was caught redhanded with 
four overage players in an international youth tourney last year 
salinas own election was the most disputed in the 60year 
history of the pri salinas won just over half the vote but reports 
abounded of multiplevoting stolen ballot boxes and other fraud 
mayor manuel camacho solis of mexico city in december ordered 
all car owners in the capital to have their vehicles tested to fight 
the citys smog generally considered the worlds worst almost 
immediately inspectors began passing polluting cars for fees 
ranging up to double the price of testing 
two acapulco judges were suspended in december and face trial on 
charges of accepting a 200000 bribe to order the release from 
prison of alejandro braun diaz a 34yearold playboy convicted of 
raping and killing a 6yearold girl braun is believed to have fled 
to canada 
on dec 11 explosions and fire ripped through a crowded mexico 
city street market killing 62 people residents blamed tons of 
illegal fireworks sold at the market and said police had been bribed 
to ignore the threat the government allowed them to sell here

day after day year after year 
venezuelans read or hear of official corruption but not a single 
person has ever been convicted at least no one from the political 
establishment 
corruption seems so deeply rooted and may have gained so many 
adherents in venezuela the author arturo uslar pietri suggests 
that the honest should regarded as fools 
normal in venezuela is to take advantage of a political 
position to obtain personal benefits and become rich he said in 
an interview those who dont do it are considered inferiors 
but corruption cases in venezuela become so entangled that few 
can sort them out and in the end they fade away in a loss of 
interest by a confused public 
the latest case involves elimination of a government agency known 
as recadi which in the previous government distributed 40 billion 
for subsidized imports 
of that amount some 6 billion is said to have been granted 
fraudulently mostly by overpricing personal connections or even 
outright bribery contributing to the depletion of the nations 
monetary reserves 
in a swirl of charges and counter charges one figure in the 
scandal attempted suicide the leftist past of the judge handling 
the case was brought into play with implications that he is acting 
for political reasons the judge sent an industrialist to jail for 
eight days for charging that the judge himself took bribes and for 
blaming the recadi fraud on a former president and his sweetheart 
secretary 
recadi was created in early 1983 as venezuelas oil bonanza began 
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed cheap dollars were 
lavishly granted via recadi to both private and public companies for 
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation 
but it soon became a nest of corruption that was 
practically designed for fraud congressional investigators have 
charged 
a thorough investigation however might take years just to check 
the 14000 or so companies that received cheap dollars 
in one case millions of dollars were granted to import holstein 
heifers to improve venezuelas dairy stock the heifers turned out 
not to be holsteins but scrawny feeble specimens as one 
rancher described them 
hundreds of the heifers were abandoned on a plain to become 
carrion for vultures the newspaper el nacional reported 
in another incident ana teresa herrera was fired as a recadi 
inspector when she began investigating a company that had been 
granted 14 million to import three airplanes only one was brought 
to venezuela 
and that plane never flew she told reporters after 
testifying before judge luis guillermo de la riva who is in charge 
of the current recadi case 
the scandal became a drama when former development minister 
hector meneses whose office also granted cheap dollars for imports 
shot himself in the head he survived but lost the sight of one eye 
and remains in a coma in a caracas hospital unable to tell what he 
knows 
before shooting himself meneses wrote a letter to his wife 
claiming innocence and suggesting he had merely carried out 
instructions from two of his former colleagues they in turn also 
claimed innocence 
so far only eight people have been jailed to await trial 
although de la riva has issued 32 arrest warrants 
in a setback for the judge however it turned out that most of 
subjects of the warrants had resigned from their business jobs long 
before recadi was even created and no longer live in venezuela 
then de la riva also came under the fire of critics who recalled 
that he had years before supported leftist guerrillas the 
implication was that it was more than coincidence that leftist 
congressmen were leading the public outcry in the case 
another setback for the judge was his order for the arrest of 
nicomedes zuloaga member of a prominent venezuelan family and 
president of gramoven a grain processing company accused of 
importing overpriced wheat 
upon turning himself in zuloaga noted that he was venezuelas 
ambassador to argentina when the alleged overpricing took place a 
friend alfredo paul delfino accused the judge of receiving bribes 
and charged that former president jaime lusinchi and his private 
secretary and companion blanca ibanez were the real thieves 
de la riva ordered delfino to jail for eight days 
lusinchi whose affair with ibanez and his attempt to divorce his 
wife of more than 40 years constituted a scandal in his years as 
president has threatened to file suit against delfino 
in the recadi case there is a too much transparent classism 
the independent newspaper el universal said in an editorial there 
are no politicians in jail and the laws hand strikes only on 
businessmen whereas the ones to blame for the corruption were within 
recadi 
as the plot becomes more entangled many believe that behind the 
scandal lies a political struggle between lusinchi and president 
carlos andres perez who took office in february for the leadership 
of their accion democratica the biggest in venezuela

within hours after he became colombias 
police commander gen miguel gomez padilla had launched the 
toughest anticocaine operation ever seen here the effort has 
earned him praise and reportedly a 1 million contract on his life 
gomez replaced gen jose guillermo medina sanchez on jan 25 
medina is under investigation for cocaine trafficking 
two hours after gomez took over he put into action operation 
springtime hitting drug traffickers where it hurts most 
destroying chemicals needed to make cocaine he is beating all 
records for destruction of chemicals and seizing of drugs 
by friday police had destroyed 1618722 gallons of liquid 
chemicals at clandestine labs according to information from the 
federal police departments antinarcotics division that outpaced 
the 936171 gallons destroyed by colombian authorities all last 
year the division said 
even more impressive police said they have destroyed more than 
35 million pounds of solid chemicals in five months five times 
what was seized in 1988 
under his anticorruption campaign 1000 of colombias 80000 
police officers have been fired said a colonel who works for 
gomez one police colonel was caught with 884 pounds of cocaine in 
his car 
gomez has gained scant public attention but a us embassy 
source said embassy officials and us drug enforcement 
administration agents are awed by his work 
the medellin cartel which includes the countrys biggest cocaine 
traffickers has a 1 million contract to kill gomez an officer 
with the narcotics intelligence division told the associated press 
gomez is never seen in public and takes a helicopter even for 
short hops inside bogota a city of 6 million people 
murder for hire is common in colombia gunmen paid by drug 
traffickers have killed a justice minister an attorney general 30 
judges two newspaper editors and scores of police officers and 
soldiers 
twelve members of colombias supreme court were killed three 
years ago when guerrillas took over the palace of justice in bogota 
the government said the guerrillas were working with drug smugglers 
and destroyed hundreds of files on drug trafficking 
last month a car bomb exploded as a bullet resistant car 
carrying the chief of colombias investigative police was passing by 
on a bogota street 
six people were killed the police general miguel maza was only 
slightly hurt drug traffickers had planned the attempted 
assassination maza said 
gomez apparently has the backing of president virgilio barco who 
forced gomezs predecessor out 
gomez is increasing the strength of the narcotics division from 
2000 to 3000 police officers in the next few months his aides 
said 
narcotics police putting machine guns on old bell 206 and 212 
helicopters are hitting cocaine laboratories with 20man 
detachments 
gomez switched the focus from seizing cocaine and cocaine base 
which labs had quickly replaced after confiscations to taking the 
chemicals needed to refine the drug a highranking narcotics 
officer said 
but his men also have destroyed 37243 pounds of cocaine and 
cocaine base in five months the narcotics police said last year 
police got 49715 pounds 
despite the efforts antidrug force which receive 15 million 
in us aid appear outgunned by a multibilliondollar drug empire 
with jet planes modern armaments and the ability to bribe or 
intimidate scores of politicians 
the air force does not have planes equipped to carry chemicals 
long distances to dump on and to destroy coca patches in colombias 
eastern jungles one pilot compared the effort to eradicate drugs to 
trying to put out a forest fire with a fire extinguisher

the tanker responsible for the nations worst 
oil spill limps into san diego bay for repairs tuesday rejected as 
a pollution risk elsewhere but a welcome buoy to this citys 
foundering shipbuilding industry 
the ruptured exxon valdez is expected to generate about 300 extra 
jobs at the national steel and shipbuilding co under a repair 
contract from exxon shipping co worth about 25 million 
the valdez built at the shipyard in 1986 ripped its hull open 
march 24 on bligh reef in alaskas prince william sound nearly 11 
million gallons of crude oil poured into the sound polluting parks 
and fishing areas and killing wildlife 
i think san diegans are as disturbed about the oil spill as 
anyone said max schetter director of the chamber of commerces 
economic research bureau 
but despite the disaster the ship does need to be repaired and 
this is the best place to do it he said it means jobs for san 
diegans and it is a shot in the arm for a company just recently 
purchased by its employees 
like other american shipyards nassco has been struggling to stay 
in business in the face of increased foreign competition since 
1978 55 us shipyards and repair facilities have closed with a 
loss of 60000 jobs according to the shipbuilders council of 
america in washington dc just friday the last shipyard operating 
out of los angeles harbor announced it was closing 
in april nassco employees purchased the shipyard from morrison 
knudsen corp of boise idaho and the valdez repair was the first 
contract they secured since the ownership change 
the nassco work force has declined from a peak of 8700 in 1980 
to 2700 today during the projected ninemonth repair nassco is 
expanding its work force to 3000 
restoring the tanker to original specifications will require 
replacing about 3000 tons of steel about 10 percent of its 
structure 
the approximately 42 million gallons of oil that remained in the 
987foot valdez after the accident was transferred to other tankers 
the ship was then refloated cleaned and given partial repairs while 
exxon searched for a drydock to rebuild it 
exxon initially considered taking the valdez to portland ore 
but the coast guard and the oregon department of environmental 
quality feared there would be residual oil in the tanker that could 
foul the columbia river at portland and drew up a long list of 
conditions for exxon to meet 
also the coast guard capt james calhoun in portland warned in 
april that radical elements might resort to violence if the 
tanker went to portland 
carrie chassin a spokeswoman for exxon shipping co said 
exxons decision to bring the ship to san diego had nothing to do 
with concern over public opposition in portland 
it was a business decision she said the concern in 
portland originated very early on before we knew we could get all 
the crude off we were able to totally steam clean the ship and 
there is no residual cargo 
once we were assured and had knowledge that the ship was not 
going to cause an environmental problem we were pleased to get the 
work said fred hallett nasscos vice president of finance and 
public relations 
the valdez lifted anchor june 23 towed by two tugboats on 
tuesday san diego chief harbor pilot capt edward j silva jr 
who happens to be a member of the militant environmental group 
greenpeace will guide the valdez through san diego bay to a nassco 
dock 
while the valdez is off the coast monday the coast guard will 
conduct a final inspection before clearing the ship to enter the 
harbor 
seven coast guard and harbor police boats will ring the vessel to 
prevent spectators and possible protests from disrupting the ships 
harbor movements 
environmental groups have announced they plan demonstrations but 
wont organize disruptions 
we dont want to block it because we feel the safest place for 
this thing right now is on dry dock said rick nadeau director of 
greenpeace in san diego 
greenpeace the sierra club and several other environmental 
groups plan a joint rally in coronado to coincide with the valdezs 
arrival 
we do want to make a public statement that this ship has become 
a symbol of ocean and atmospheric destruction nadeau said 
as far as were concerned its being repaired so it might go 
out and have another accident he said hopefully it wont but 
its not impossible

in the vendee region where liberty 
and brotherhood were eclipsed by scorched earth and slaughter talk 
of the french revolutions bicentennial provokes cool hard stares 
for us it was a horrible genocide a lasting source of 
national shame said roger jouteau manager of this little town 
which is still recovering in some ways from a republican assault 
in 1794 
as official france basks in glory many frenchmen dispute the 
view that their revolution shaped the principle of universal human 
rights instead these critics accuse authorities of whitewashing a 
black period 
one such group of dissenters hopes to assemble 500000 people on 
aug 15 to pray for forgiveness for revolutionary excesses they 
will gather at the place de la concorde in paris where king louis 
xvi was beheaded 
bitterness is especially profound and even personal in the 
rolling hills of vendee a region of rich farmland south of the 
loire river and extending east from the atlantic ocean 
the first human right is the right to truth said philippe de 
villiers a member of parliament from vendee in raucous debate on 
the popular television program apostrophes 
his book open letter to the head choppers and liars of the 
bicentennial notes that vladimir lenin studied frances 
revolution as a model for russia and josef stalin recalled its 
period of bloodletting known as the reign of terror to justify his 
purges 
the guillotine is famous de villiers argues but few recall the 
300000 vendeens killed in battle disemboweled starved or shoved 
alive into bread ovens in a twoyear civil war 
most victims were not aristrocrats but peasants who defended the 
roman catholic clergy and resisted conscription to fight faraway 
wars children described as future rebels were massacred 
such new studies as simon schamas us bestseller citizens 
assert that much of france remained loyal to the king who initially 
agreed to enlightened rule under a constitution 
critics say bicentennial celebrations ignore the terror that 
followed and later produced napoleon bonaparte and finally another 
bourbon king 
typical of the vendee les herbiers is to mark the revolution 
july 14 as it always does with only a brief ceremony ordered by 
paris 
to forget what happened it is shocking jouteau said to 
spend hundreds of millions of francs that could be used for other 
things shocking 
de villiers hammered away at this theme on television 
criticizing what he estimated as the equivalent of 50 million being 
spent on celebrating french glory in the presence of foreign leaders 
he touched a nerve across the country but reaction was perhaps 
strongest in vendee 
monique amirda a patriotic woman wears a gold necklace in the 
shape of the regions emblem a double heart with a cross and crown 
to indicate loyalty to god and king 
after watching de villiers she told a reporter about visiting a 
bicentennial display in paris that listed enemy territories subdued 
by the revolution one was the vendee 
i was so horrified i nearly went into shock she said 
yves viollier who writes historical novels and teaches at la 
rochesuryon said de villiers might be too strident but his point 
is indisputable 
he estimated vendees 1789 population at 250000 of which 
150000 were killed on both sides in the civil war im ready to 
call it genocide he said 
schools suppressed history of the war during the 19th century he 
said but the region was still regarded with suspicion in world war 
i he added vendeen units were sent straight to the front 
until i was 11 life here was almost like it was in the 19th 
century viollier it was only in the last 30 years that we 
rejoined the world

the bush administration has welcomed the 
global trend away from authoritarian rule but at least two stops on 
secretary of state james a baker iiis swing through asia and 
europe seem immune to such democratic changes 
baker has spent much of the past four days in brunei and oman 
both sultanates that are virtually devoid of the democratic 
trappings normally advocated by the united states 
in this arabian peninsula nation there are no political parties 
no legislature and no elections all power rests with sultan qaboos 
the latest in a line of monarchs who have ruled this kansassized 
land since the 1740s 
baker decided to stop off in oman mainly to rest before joining 
president bush in poland the first stop on a fournation european 
tour 
oman was chosen in part because few arab nations if any are 
friendlier to the united states oman was one of the first arab 
nations that endorsed the 1978 camp david peace agreement between 
egypt and israel 
as authoritarian rulers go qaboos appears to be more benign than 
most when he deposed his father in 1970 oman was a land plagued by 
poverty disease and illiteracy 
in 19 years qaboos has been able to forge what is for the most 
part a modern prosperous nation overcoming such obstacles as a 
forbidding climate that often sends temperatures above 130 degrees 
according to state department figures there were only three 
schools in oman in 1970 in 1986 there were 697 the number of 
hospital beds rose from 12 to 2800 in the same time period 
oil helped finance the boom much as it did in bakers previous 
stop brunei 
unlike oman brunei has a constitution but it provides sultan 
hassanal bolkiah with supreme executive authority 
the occasion for bakers visit to brunei was the annual meeting 
of the sixmember association of southeast asian nations 
like oman brunei has a system with a social conscience 
providing subsidized food fuel housing free education and medical 
care 
bruneis 250000 citizens enjoy an unusually high standard of 
living which permits them to over look the opulent lifestyle of 
their ruler and his two wives 
the main attraction in brunei about the size of delaware is the 
sultans palace a 1788room extravaganza with a dining room 
capable of accommodating 6000 for a sitdown meal need a bathroom 
the palace has more than 200 
amid such abundance the sultan is somewhat wary about 
inquisitive reporters before the start of the asean conference 
reporters were told to write about the conference not about brunei 
still the sultan has been unable to conceal his role as perhaps 
the worlds richest man with an estimated wealth of 28 billion 
almost four times the gross national product of oman 
he is one of a handful of men who has claim to a fortune that 
dwarfs the estimated 3 billion to 5 billion of zaires autocratic 
president mobutu sese seko the last foreign leader whom baker 
entertained before departing on his tour

being a woman has not made it difficult to govern 
pakistan prime minister benazir bhutto says but it may have caused 
some difficulties for her political opponents and moslem 
fundamentalists 
i dont often think of myself as a woman prime minister ms 
bhutto said in a televised interview sunday with david frost 
i just think of myself as someone whos leading the government 
whos got a job to do not an easy one and who would like to have 
the prayers of wellwishers everywhere in completing the task in 
strengthening the rule of law and improving the quality of life for 
the people of pakistan 
ms bhutto 35 is the first woman in modern times to lead a 
moslem country and is the worlds youngest prime minister 
i think it may be a little difficult for my opponents or the 
fundamentalists to have a woman prime minister she said 
of course its different being a woman theres a greater 
formality or distance which must be followed so i try to make the 
best of it 
ms bhutto won power in november in pakistans first free 
elections in more than a decade she arrived in britain on wednesday

steffi graf won and cried and about the only thing boris becker 
fumbled at wimbledon was the winners trophy 
i wanted it so badly that i put a little more pressure on 
myself than usual the 20yearold graf of west germany said after 
overpowering navratilova in the final set to win her second straight 
womens championship 62 67 61 its an overwhelming feeling 
also sunday becker blasted passing shots down both lines to 
defeat defending champion stefan edberg in straight sets in a 
rematch of the 1988 final claiming his third wimbledon title in 
five years 
the 21yearold west german who regained the title he won in 
1985 and 1986 defeated edberg 60 76 64 in the most onesided 
final since john mcenroe allowed jimmy connors only four games in 
1984 
the championship trophy was the about only thing he couldnt 
handle as he strolled around centre court showing off the cup he 
lightheartedly juggled the trophy and fumbled it allowing the top 
to pop off and onto the grass court

it didnt reach the goose that laid the 
golden egg but for 31 years a man named jack grew and grew and 
grew a philodendron until it could be stretched the length of nearly 
four football fields 
the vine reached his living room ceiling and wound up down and 
around itself at christmas time he strung colored lights from it 
while it kept on growing until it reached a record 1114 feet 
and then in 1984 jack francis chopped it down 
it was a bit of a sentimental moment because it had been 
around so long i bought it as a little sprout in sears when we 
first moved to amherst the university of massachusetts professor 
said 
but sentiment aside francis said he was forced to fell his 
prized philodendron 
that was the only way we could measure it for the record and 
to tell you the truth i was getting a bit tired of it he said 
chopped into fourfoot lengths it stacked up like cordwood 
his children persuaded him to submit it to the guinness book of 
world records and years later he and his plant are still enjoying 
their day in the sun 
i did it as a joke and no one was more surprised than i when 
they accepted it francis said and if id only realized the 
sort of attention it would get id at at least have taken a proper 
picture of it 
but jacks stalk weighed about 250 pounds and dragging it into a 
welllighted spot seemed overwhelming so the photo opportunity was 
missed 
francis walls are lined with plaques commending him for his 
academic achievements in the field of food science and nutrition 
but that acclaim has been shaded by his gardening success 
despite all this francis said gesturing to the citations 
what im known for to everybody is growing the worlds largest 
philodendron 
the key to growing the worlds largest philodendron the 
previous mark had been 600 feet is patience francis said 
other than fertilizing every time he watered and winding it back 
around itself francis took no special steps 
one of the problems i had though was repotting it he said 
they only make pots so big and it had pretty much reached the 
maximum and there wasnt much dirt left when we cut it down 
but thats the way jacks garden grows his late tomato plants 
were already a thick lush 7foot hedge the first week in july when 
most new england gardeners are nursing along 2 and 3foot plants 
he also grows dozens of varieties of vegetables ranging from the 
common zucchini to such southern exotics as passion fruit kiwi and 
chayote 
his 50by70foot garden got so dense that a few years back when 
he was a semifinalist in the annual gardening contest run by 
pbstvs victory garden the cameras couldnt get into the rows 
i dont have the space for them to grow horizontally so they 
have to grow up francis said this is my latest experiment and 
sweet potatoes dont like growing up at all i have to tuck them 
back in the cage every day

an indian inmate pounded a 
drum outside a canvas dome while inside a purification ceremony 
capped a twoyear legal battle over the religious rite 
with saturdays ceremony at the state prison utah became the 
19th state to allow indian sweat lodges on prison grounds 
corrections officials had resisted the rituals arguing they posed a 
security risk 
this shows you can make anything work as long as you put your 
heart in it we pray for positiveness and unity said arvol 
looking horse keeper of the pipe for the sioux nation 
a group of prisoners in 1987 sued to get the sweat lodges and 
us district court judge j thomas greene ruled in march that the 
prohibition was unreasonable because it meant that the native 
american religion was not being accommodated to the extent other 
religions are 
it was fun to win this thing said danny quintana who 
represented the inmates in the court battle i was very happy with 
the way it turned out 
the sweat lodge is a small dome built of willow branch poles 
covered with blankets and canvas 
on saturday worshipers entered the sweat lodge poured water 
over a bed of heated rocks and recited prayers 
outside the dome inmates played a water drum and gourd and 
chanted and sang as part of the traditional ceremony 
nine indian inmates from the blackfoot shoshone sioux and 
navajo tribes participated in the twohour ceremony 
its something big for them today something they can look 
forward to said robert eagleman of the navajo nation corrections 
project 
darrell gardner a medicine man who built the lodge and will run 
the rituals on saturdays said the religious experience will have a 
definite impact on the practicing inmates 
theyre gonna be different people it changes them and well 
all benefit from it gardner said 
tribal officials say the sweat lodge is central to purification 
and ceremonial rites that date back thousands of years 
prison officials claimed the rituals threatened security because 
the lodge must be dark and enclosed greenes ruling stipulated that 
prison guards could dismantle the lodge after each weekly ceremony 
the assembly of the lodge takes only a few hours

one of the last poems written by gertrude 
stein the american writer who spent most of her life in france is 
being published for the first time by the american correspondent she 
gave it to 45 years ago 
he is frank gervasi now 81 years old who has put it in a book 
called the violent decade being published today 
he said the poem was her way of thanking him for getting her own 
book wars i have seen through wartime censorship to her new 
york publisher stein died in 1946 at the age of 72 
the poem called a ballad was written on nine pages of air 
mail paper from air france the french national airline 
it begins 
a big bird flying high 
in the sky 
makes little birds sitting by 
know they must do or die 
the 73 lines tell how the little birds keep hitting the big bird 
until it falls into a lake and drowns it concludes 
and this does happen every day 
just like i say 
for frank gervasi 
culoz september 1 happy days always 
signed gtd st 
gervasi said he interpreted the poem as an expression of joy in 
the imminent triumph of virtue over evil as world war ii came to an 
end 
stein is famous for the line a rose is a rose is a rose much 
of her writing emphasizes repetition and the use of words as much 
for their sound as for their meaning 
culoz is the little railroad town in southern france where stein 
and her companion alice b toklas lived during the german 
occupation of france 
gervasi wrote that he and eric sevareid then a radio 
correspondent now a consultant for cbs joined in an expedition to 
liberate the two women as the germans pulled back 
they were a day too late stein toklas and their poodle basket 
had ridden into the nearby town of belley in a taxi found it full 
of american soldiers had a big party with them stayed overnight 
and went home 
next day gervasi and sevareid reached their house la colombiere 
got bonecrunching hugs and an invitation to lunch 
she told him local french officials never let the germans know 
that she was american and jewish though german officers were 
quartered in her house he quoted her as saying 
but once i had an italian major and his aide as guests the 
major remarked on my accent but if he guessed my identity he never 
gave me away as an american which goes to show the difference 
between the italians and germans in more ways than one 
gervasi said she was full of questions about ernest hemingway 
whom she obviously disliked hemingway had been a frequent 
visitor to her paris apartment and she is credited with having 
influenced his style 
gervasi lives in new york he went to work for the associated 
press there in 1934 and the same year moved to universal news which 
sent him to spain to begin his career as a foreign correspondent 
his book covers the five years before world war ii in spain and 
italy and then follows the war through north africa to sicily the 
italian mainland greece and france

newly inaugurated president carlos 
menem has suggested argentina and britain temporarily set aside 
their claims to the falkland islands and meet to discuss the 
resumption of diplomatic relations 
if mrs thatcher doesnt insist on the issue of sovereignty we 
wont either menem told a news conference sunday meanwhile 
we could advance in the dialogue toward reestablishing relations 
the two countries went to war in 1982 over the windswept 
sparsely populated islands that are 350 miles east of southern 
argentina britain won and diplomatic relations were never resumed 
the government of president raul alfonsin which left office 
saturday always insisted that sovereignty over the islands claimed 
by both countries but ruled by britain since 1833 be an issue in 
bilateral negotiations 
menems position on the ownership of the islands that argentines 
call the malvinas is clear we are convinced that the malvinas are

consumers are paying recordhigh potato prices 
and probably wont see much relief until the new fall crop is ready 
in a few months says an agriculture department economist 
other highvalue farm crops including fresh produce and some 
nuts are also costing more part of the reason stems from last 
years drought part from rising demand 
retail prices of fresh potatoes in may averaged 368 cents per 
pound nationally up from 247 cents a year earlier 
glenn zepp of the departments economic research service said 
that was the highest monthly potato price since at least 1980 and 
that probably none before then was as high 
we had a small fall crop last year and there has also been 
strong demand for potatoes for processing zepp said the real 
competition this spring seems to have been between the chippers and 
the fresh market prices for both really went up 
zepp said in a telephone interview last week and in an 
agricultural outlook magazine report that the high potato prices 
have created optimism among growers 
but this could lead to substantially higher plantings for the 
fall crop and sharply lower prices in the next marketing year he 
said 
the farm price of potatoes nationally in may averaged 894 per 
100 pounds compared with 462 in may 1988 the preliminary price 
for june showed some easing to 844 per hundredweight 
according to usda records the may and june farm prices of 
potatoes were the highest since july 1984 when they averaged 972 
per hundredweight in 1981 prices also rose to more than 9 during 
a couple of months 
zepp said last years drought hurt the crop severely in the 
midwest where many of the smaller round white potatoes are grown 
for processing into chips the north dakota harvest of fall 
potatoes for example was less than 144 million hundredweight 
down 38 percent from 1987 
in all last falls harvest which makes up most of the us 
production with winter spring and summer varieties accounting for 
the remainder dropped 10 percent to 3072 million hundredweight 
total production was less than 350 million hundredweight down 9 
percent 
despite the smaller 1988 crop processing use of potatoes was 
down only 2 percent during the winter and spring and by may 1 the 
nations inventories of fresh potatoes were down 22 percent from a 
year earlier 
according to labor department figures for may the june report 
will be issued on july 19 retail prices for all fresh vegetables 
averaged 23 percent more than a year ago higher tomato prices also 
helped boost the may index 
in addition to specific potato and tomato price pressures use 
of salad bars in restaurants and grocery stores and growing 
consumer awareness of fresh produces nutritional value are pushing 
up vegetable prices zepp said 
based on june 1 estimates for major summer fruits consumers can 
expect reduced supplies of peaches bartlett pears nectarines and 
plums while apricot and sweet cherry production will increase 
freestone peach output is expected to be down 16 percent from 
last year with all the major growing areas reporting reduced 
prospects zepp said freeze damage during the critical bloom period 
in march and april reduced the outlook in georgia and south carolina 
californias clingstone peach production which is mostly canned 
is expected to be fractionally larger than last year 
however bartlett pear production in california oregon and 
washington is forecast down 5 percent prices paid to growers are 
likely to be higher 
this years harvest of tart cherries may drop below the 
relatively small 1988 harvest drought damaged trees and reduced bud 
formation in michigan and frosts this spring caused further losses 
michigan typically produces about 75 percent of the nations tart 
cherries 
zepp said that 198990 should be good for almond growers 
because of higher prices resulting from an expected 24 percent drop 
in production to 450 million pounds 
walnut sales and shipments have been running below yearearlier 
levels partly because of ample supplies of almonds and pecans 
market activity is slow for the other tree nuts also he 
said filbert pecan and pistachio dealers are waiting for 
newcrop production macadamia acreage and production continue to 
expand

the energy department is preparing a new 
strategy to win public acceptance of expanded nuclear power more 
oil exploration and other energy goals pursued but never attained 
by past administrations 
those who formulated the plan say it will rest on a foundation of 
figures compiled by computer to spell out how much energy the nation 
will need where to get it what it will cost and how it will 
affect the environment 
theyve never done that before henson moore deputy energy 
secretary said in an interview as a result he said the 
underpinnings of energy policy have been overly vulnerable to public 
challenge 
our credibility is not what it ought to be because weve not 
really done this right in the past he said adding that the 
department wants to set a credibility standard that will be 
accepted by energy producers and consumer alike 
scientists from the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
livermore calif will design the computer programs a special 
panel of the national academy of sciences has agreed to review the 
results and the final analysis moore said 
we will have something thats generally recognized as not 
being slanted said moore a former congressman from louisiana who 
wanted to be president bushs energy secretary but was persuaded to 
take the no 2 job 
moore said details of the new approach will be announced before 
the end of july although the energy policy eventually developed 
from the data base likely wont be ready for at least another year 
he said the department probably will hold public hearings this fall 
on policy options 
the department chose linda stuntz 34 an attorney and former 
minority staff director of the house energy and commerce committee 
to direct the policy development 
calls for a new national energy policy have intensified amid 
increased public attention to prospects for a renewed oil squeeze 
caused by falling us production and rising consumption and a 
possible electricity crisis in the 1990s 
when he took over as energy secretary in march james d watkins 
said he was surprised to see that while past administrations 
produced mountains of studies and analyses of the energy problem 
none mapped out a way of solving it 
watkins ordered the deartment to develop an action plan based 
on a consistent body of facts about all aspects of the energy 
picture including the environment once armed the department will 
stand a better chance of overcoming opposition to nuclear power and 
other bush energy priorities moore said 
were going to have something that people will respect and 
theyre going to be hardpressed to meet us in the streets at high 
noon and compare their data with ours and beat us he said 
just getting a generally accepted body of facts will be a major 
feat 
if we achieve that we have achieved a major victory and we 
have accomplished the major bush administration energy initiative of 
his first administration moore said 
moore said his department is starting without preconceived 
notions about what a national energy policy should entail but he 
and watkins already have made clear they want to push to revive the 
nuclear industry and give oil companies more latitude to explore for 
oil and natural gas on federal lands and in promising offshore areas 
these goals were pursued by the reagan administration during its 
eight years in office yet nuclear power remains in the doldrums and 
congress has grown more reluctant to permit oil development in 
environmentally sensitive areas 
the oil industry hurt its cause with the exxon valdez oil spill 
in alaska last march and a series of less damaging spills on the 
east coast and the gulf of mexico moore said the industry must work 
to restore public confidence but the energy department will be in a 
position to provide more help than in the past

republicans have high hopes of claiming claude 
peppers old house seat in one of three sunbelt special elections 
this summer but face tougher odds in races to replace democrats who 
left because of ethical problems 
republican prospects appear dimmest in texas where former 
speaker jim wright quit after a gopsponsored ethics investigation 
democrats expect a former aide to sen lloyd bentsen to hold the 
seat for them 
california shapes up as the most competitive of the three races 
in a district that regularly elected democrat tony coelho but where 
his party owns only a narrow margin in voter registration coelho 
quit unexpectedly last month rather than face an ethics probe into 
his finances 
the results in the three races will have scant impact on the 
balance of power in the house where democrats hold a 257175 
majority and have held power for more than three decades 
but the contests represent the first congressional balloting 
since democrats became ensnared in the ethics difficulties and 
since republicans were criticized for a memo that compared speaker 
thomas foleys voting record to that of rep barney frank of 
massachusetts an openly homosexual lawmaker 
democrats see a battle for the florida seat held by pepper who 
died may 30 
this is going to be a tough seat for us no question about 
that said howard schloss spokesman for the democratic 
congressional campaign committee the demographics have switched 
in the years since claude pepper and were going to have a tough 
battle on our hands to hold on 
cubanamericans are now 40 percent of the miami districts 
voters wrathful toward the havana government they are 
overwhelmingly republican 
the votes are going to go to the one who hates fidel castro 
the most and loves ollie north the most says californiabased 
lobbyist arnoldo torres 
two cubanamericans state sen ileana roslehtinen and 
millionaire businessman carlos perez a prominent fundraiser for 
north are dueling for the gop nomination in the aug 1 primary 
former north miami mayor john stembridge and insurance broker david 
m fleischer also are on the gop ballot 
among democrats miami city commissioner rosario kennedy has 
strong labor support while joanne pepper the late congressmans 
niece is running a lawandorder antidrug campaign that includes 
prowling the streets with a police swat team 
six other democrats are in the field but party officials 
nationally are glum about the district and republicans are taking 
care not to appear overconfident 
both parties say democratic chances are better in coelhos old 
california district which extends through the heavily agricultural 
central valley and wrights bastion around fort worth 
we know the republicans will put up a strong battle in 
california but were confident that we can hold both seats 
democratic spokesman schloss said 
in california a battle is shaping up between conservative state 
rep gary condit dmodesto and former state food and agriculture 
director clare berryhill a republican in what could turn out to be 
a 10candidate open primary 
republican democratic and minor party candidates will face off 
on the same ballot sept 12 any contender gaining a majority gets a 
ticket to washington otherwise the top republican and top democrat 
meet in a runoff 
berryhill 64 has strong conservative credentials and another 
advantage in the croprich valley he is known as a supporter of 
the interests of the agricultural community says agricultural 
consultant william lesher 
with a slight democratic edge in registration districtwide 
condit hopes to win the seat outright in september berryhill says 
his strategy will be to hold condit to 50 percent or less and then 
face him oneonone in the november runoff 
in texas bentsens backing for 37yearold attorney pete geren 
may have discouraged other democrats 
austin political consultant george christian says the senators 
support represents a sort of good housekeeping seal of approval 
among democrats 
i think in a special election where youve got a man who gets 
in the race with obvious support and obvious money then another 
fella who wants to get in the race certainly has a big mountain to 
climb he said 
all the candidates clash on one ballot aug 12 with a runoff 
later in the month between the top two votegetters regardless of 
party if no one gets a majority 
among republicans dr bob lanier host of a television health 
show has been boasting of high name recognition 
larraine bethke a republican former congressional staffer is 
also running along with democratturnedrepublican jim hunter who 
lost in an earlier bid for sheriff

the poor women who hoped to end their 
pregnancies at missouris two public hospitals offering abortions 
will be most affected by last weeks us supreme court ruling 
the ruling also will mean fewer doctors willing to perform 
abortions and fewer counselors willing to give advice to indigents 
about the operation according to abortion rights activists 
doctors in this state feel the tightening of the screws it 
would take a lot of commitment to womens rights to continue said 
mary bryant of planned parenthood whose organization already has 
difficulty finding doctors willing to perform abortions at its 
columbia clinic 
when blackmun talks about a chill wind blowing he has no idea 
how chill it is in missouri bryant said 
in his dissenting opinion to july 3s ruling justice harry 
blackmun said that while women still can obtain legal abortions 
the signs are evident and very ominous and a chill wind blows 
the court in a 54 vote upheld missouris restrictive abortion 
law and invited further challenges to the historic 1973 roe vs wade 
decision that made abortion a right of women nationwide 
the missouri law prohibits abortions from being performed at 
public hospitals bans tax dollars from being spent for 
encouraging or counseling women to have abortions and requires 
doctors to determine when possible whether a fetus 20 or more 
weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb 
antiabortion groups said the ruling was a step in the right 
direction 
our whole goal has been to chip away at roe and stop 
abortions said anne carmichael of missouri citizens for life 
if weve succeeded at chipping away thats a good thing 
state attorney general william webster who argued in favor of 
the law and abortion rights advocates who opposed it agreed the 
decision would not immediately limit the availability of abortions 
in missouri in a dramatic way 
of the 17382 procedures in missouri last year only 90 were 
performed at public hospitals 
bryant and others say the ruling will slowly and subtly curtail 
the procedure especially for poor women in missouri 
only two missouri public hospitals performed abortions in most 
cases for needy women who suffered from other medical problems that 
made their abortions risky said carroll metzger a former nursing 
administrator at one of the hospitals truman medical center west in 
kansas city 
metzger who now works elsewhere in the kansas city area was one 
of the original plaintiffs in the lawsuit that challenged the 
missouri law which was passed in 1986 but did not go into effect 
until the high court decision 
the reality that no one talks about is that women who are very 
poor cant afford abortions in missouri anyway now were limiting 
it even further metzger said missouri cut off public funding for 
abortions in 1980 
abortions are available in kansas city st louis springfield 
and columbia women in remote rural areas such as the southeastern 
bootheel region often must make long trips to the city to get 
abortions or inexpensive medical attention of any kind 
metzger and bryant said doctors and counselors who serve 
lowincome women will be unlikely even to broach the subject of 
abortion for fear they will be sued although it would still be 
legal to tell a pregnant woman what her options are 
public doctors and nurses would be crazy to talk about it the 
chilling effect is going to be devastating said bryant 
diane booth executive director of planned parenthoods clinic in 
columbia said its been difficult for several years to find doctors 
willing to perform abortions a kansas city doctor travels 125 miles 
to perform abortions at the clinic 
given the size of columbias medical community thats quite an 
indictment booth said columbia a city of about 60000 
residents has three hospitals including the university of 
missouricolumbia hospital and clinics the other public hospital 
where abortions were performed before last week

as the creator of the comic book zen 
intergalactic ninja sees it most of todays space aliens are 
either bad guys or wimps 
enter zen a short muscular blueskinned space warrior a 
nononsense sort of extraterrestrial 
sort of the dirty harry of aliens said his creator steve 
stern 
rather than spattering smalltime villains with a big revolver 
like the clint eastwood film character however zen addresses the 
big questions 
his latest mission is to save earth from ecological destruction 
at the hands of a planetdevouring madman named notan the 
magnificent zen works through his mental link with jeremy the 
offspring of an alien queen and a mortal human 
stern and airbrush artist dan cote publish the bimonthly comic as 
a sideline from their jobs stern heads a small advertising 
business cote is a commercial artist in lewiston 
until now writers and film producers have treated most space 
aliens as evil said stern citing a tradition that extends from the 
hg wells novel war of the worlds to the hit movie alien 
the exceptions he said are creatures like et whom he 
characterized as wimpy and ineffectual and alf the fuzzy but 
obnoxious star of a childrens tv show 
the comic bookbuying public responded to zen because he 
represents a true alien hero stern said in recent years there 
have been very few if any alien heroes who come to mind 
the earlier generation of otherwordly superheros such as 
superman dont count because they looked like earthlings rather 
than aliens stern said 
to underscore his scorn for nerds from outer space stern has 
printed hundreds of stickers that show an etlike character in a 
red circle with a slash through it with the phrase no wimpy 
aliens 
stern said he used zen because he believes the branch of buddhism 
offers a valuable guide to daytoday living zen imparts that 
philosophy to jeremy who develops confidence and assurance as the 
story unfolds 
cote draws the comic book with a painstakingly slow airbrush 
technique that gives it a realistic threedimensional look it is 
produced in black and white with a multicolor cover 
from an initial printing of 4000 copies for the first issue in 
november 1987 circulation has climbed to 20000 stern said he 
hopes soon to get a break that would turn zen into a national 
phenomenon 
the explosion of comic books into the mass media is at a fever 
pitch right now he said citing box office records set by the 
movie batman 
stern also sees as a promising sign a heightened awareness of 
environmental problems 
organizers of earth day 1990 have contacted stern about a 
possible role for zen in that observance stern and cote also have 
established the zen save the earth foundation which will divert a 
portion of the profits from licensing agreements to organizations 
dedicated to environmental protection 
zens creator hopes to follow in the path of teenage mutant 
ninja turtles an independently produced comic that became a major 
success spawning a popular animated television series and sets of 
toy action figures 
a line of zen pencils and notebooks is already on the market 
stern hopes a latex mask of zen can be in stores by halloween 1990 
as a boy growing up on new yorks long island stern eagerly 
awaited each new issue of batman superman and the the 
fantastic four 
following graduation from the university of miami as an english 
major he returned to new york to write horror and science fiction 
comics the pay was low and he drifted into advertising to make 
ends meet 
stern thought up zen in 1970 but stashed a onepage synopsis in 
a suitcase four years ago after moving to auburn 30 miles north 
of portland with his wife he met cote 
a couple of days earlier stern had opened his old suitcase and 
the sheet of paper with the idea for zen flew out he felt it was an 
omen and moved ahead with the project

insurance companies wont be able to cover the 
cost of a major natural disaster such as an earthquake if one 
occurs around the year 2000 according to a new actuarial study 
either a hike in insurance premiums or increased taxes will be 
needed to compensate future disaster victims said the report 
entitled forecast 2000 
the report was released in washington in advance of todays 
meeting in toronto of actuaries from throughout north america 
actuaries use economic and statistical methods to evaluate the 
financial implications of future events they are widely employed by 
insurance companies 
the survey of 332 actuaries found that 81 percent believe that 
insurance companies will not be able to cover the costs of a major 
natural disaster such as an earthquake in the year 2000 
about 90 percent of those surveyed concluded that federal 
programs such as the socalled superfund will be inadequate to cover 
the costs of cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites in the year 
2000 most thought extra taxes will be needed 
such costs will have to be borne by federal state and provincial 
governments according to 55 percent of the actuaries some 24 
percent said consumers will be stuck with this cost and only 11 
percent said the insurance companies will have to pay the rest said 
the money would come from other sources 
the survey covered 332 actuaries and was compiled by the american 
academy of actuaries the canadian institute of actuaries casualty 
actuarial society conference of actuaries in public practice and 
the society of actuaries

the nations next legal battle over 
abortion rights may center on a clinic in what looks like a peaceful 
setting an old yellowbrick schoolhouse often used for bingo 
parties 
the us supreme court has agreed to review whether the clinic 
one of six tenants in the building can operate without obeying 
elaborate state requirements for nonhospital surgical centers 
the clinics owner dr richard ragsdale said the requirements 
are medically unnecessary and designed to discourage abortion 
providers by forcing them to build the equivalent of a small 
hospital an expensive proposition 
the rules in effect make abortions harder to obtain ragsdale 
contends 
a federal judge agreed and put the rules on hold the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals also agreed but the state appealed saying 
the rules are needed to protect womens health 
the case is one of three abortionrelated lawsuits the high court 
will consider in its fall session which is expected to set a 
judicial course that could alter or revoke the right to have an 
abortion 
the other cases from minnesota and ohio concern only 
teenagers who represent about onethird of patients getting 
abortions yearly 
the illinois case affects all women seeking abortions during 
their first trimester or early second trimester of pregnancy more 
than 90 percent of all patients said colleen connell the american 
civil liberties union attorney representing ragsdale 
in addition the justices may find it difficult to revive the 
illinois laws without substantially dismantling the 1973 roe vs 
wade decision that legalized abortion observers said 
demonstrators from both sides picketed at ragsdales northern 
illinois womens center on thursday and friday 
antiabortionists buoyed by the july 3 high court ruling that 
upheld restrictions by missouri slowed traffic friday no arrests 
were reported 
we think things are moving toward prolife i just think dr 
ragsdales days are numbered here said activist denise franzen 
34 of nearby rockton 
but tracy winkler a counselor at ragsdales clinic and one of 
several staffers who held keep abortion legal signs in front of 
the center said the decision may wake up those who favor womens 
right to have an abortion 
the supreme court decision may be the kick in the butt to get 
the prochoice people to do something she said too many 
prochoicers have been too silent too long and this is the result 
the clinic has come under numerous attacks since ragsdale moved 
his practice to there four years ago after a hospital affiliate 
refused to renew his lease because of the high cost of making the 
building improvements required by the state for abortion clinics 
at least 180 people have been arrested for trespassing seven 
people have been arrested for battery and five fires have been set 
said the buildings owner wayne webster a suspect in at least two 
of the arson fires has been convicted and jailed 
its hard to picture a less likely site for such a battle 
the twostory limestoneandbrick structure is in a modest 
commercial district inside three tenants are organizations that 
hold bingo parties in a downstairs hall where wooden floors creak 
and chalk boards line the walls 
upstairs ragsdales clinic occupies onetenth of the building 
and has a 10year lease the renovated 4000squarefoot complex 
has a sophisticated security system with audio and visual monitors 
to keep track of protesters outside 
the clinic is open three mornings a week and says it serves 12 
to 30 patients daily almost all of whom receive abortions 
eightyfive percent are referred by other physicians or by 
womens healthcare centers said ragsdale who testified in 1985 
that he had probably performed 42000 abortions in the previous 12 
years 
ragsdale said he doesnt know whether he will close the clinic if 
he loses the case 
he said he doesnt have the money to make the required 
modifications and no banker would lend it to him given past 
violence against abortion clinics around the country and the 
possibility the procedure will be outlawed

raising taxes by 53 billion and putting the 
final touches on president bushs 157 billion bailout of the 
savings and loan industry dominate the focus of lawmakers returning 
from a long july fourth holiday 
before recessing again in four weeks for its annual monthlong 
august vacation congress also must look at raising the 28 
trillion statutory ceiling on the federal debt 
but first the house likely will vote this week on an 
administrationopposed moratorium on new offshore oil leasing in the 
wake of the exxon valdez tanker spill in march off the alaska coast 
the white house and congressional democrats also face the 
likelihood of another bruising fight over the transfer of us 
aircraft technology to japan for the fsx jet fighter 
bush has threatened to veto a resolution passed by congress last 
month approving the fsx deal but placing restrictions on 
negotiations for further stages in the joint project 
opponents led by organized labor fear that japan may use the 
technology to develop a commercial aerospace industry to compete 
with us plane makers they claim to have increasing support among 
lawmakers making an override of the anticipated veto possible 
the biggest tasks for lawmakers over the next month are the sampl 
bailout and coming up with 53 billion in additional federal 
revenue a euphemism for tax increase next year as part of a 
deficitreduction deal cut between bush and congressional leaders in 
april 
the sampl rescue is likely to be the easiest lawmakers hope to 
complete within two weeks a compromise package acceptable to the 
senate and house as well as the administration 
senate negotiators are expected to yield to 
administrationendorsed provisions in a housepassed bill that would 
make sampl owners put up billions of dollars more of their own money 
as a buffer between risky loans and the governments deposit 
insurance fund 
the fund now has an estimated 35 billion to 55 billion deficit 
that is growing by 30 million a day because of overly risky and 
often fraudulent loans that sampl operators made using federally 
insured deposits 
congress and the administration acknowledge that taxpayers are 
going to have to cover most of the losses but they disagree on the 
mechanics of how to spread the burden over the next three decades 
rather than force a tax increase now 
the house bill does it by borrowing the money over the next three 
years directly through the treasury department swelling the deficit 
for each year but exempting the costs from deficit reduction targets 
now in the law 
bush and the senate would raise the bailouts costs through 
private 30year bonds that avoid swelling the annual deficits but 
carry an extra interest charge to taxpayers of at least 45 billion 
at one time treasury secretary nicholas f brady had vowed to 
recommend that bush veto any sampl legislation that raises the deficit 
significantly brady however has not repeated the threat in recent 
weeks 
the taxwriting house ways and means committee will begin work 
this week on raising revenues by 53 billion next year without 
violating an understanding with the administration over what would 
constitute a violation of bushs no new taxes campaign pledge 
last year 
among the measures under consideration are a proposal by the 
panels chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill to repeal the 50 
percent exclusion on interest income for employee stock ownership 
plans 
also on the revenueenhancing chopping block are some 300 
million in tax breaks for banks that forgive third world loans and 
250 million in tax breaks for acquirers of ailing sampls

only about 1 percent of all abortions in the 
united states are performed after the 20th week of pregnancy the 
stage where questions of fetal viability could be raised statistics 
show 
a prominent part of the supreme courts abortion ruling last 
week such lateterm abortions heighten the question of when a fetus 
could live outside the womb 
based on centers of disease control statistics for 1985 the last 
year complete numbers are available only about 13280 abortions in 
the united states were performed after the 20th week of pregnancy 
the vast majority of abortions about 90 percent are performed 
by the 15th week long before viability of the fetus is a biological 
possibility 
according to studies by cdc and others about 73 percent of the 
relative handful who seek lateterm abortions are under age 24 a 
majority of them are in their teens most are unmarried 
one survey showed such women often are reluctant to tell parents 
or boyfriends of their pregnancy and many have problems arranging 
abortions because of money or transportation some didnt realize 
they were pregnant in the early weeks and a major concern for about 
third of those seeking late abortions is concealing the fact they 
are sexually active 
although the numbers are small when compared to all abortions 
performed the lateterm cases create a nightmare for doctors who 
must deal with the uncertainty of fetal age 
the issue inflames emotions among antiabortion groups who 
believe infants capable of sustaining life are being killed 
and it is an issue that attracted a major share of attention in 
the supreme courts ruling last week that gave states power to 
impose new restrictions on the right to have an abortion 
cdc statistics show that 36 percent of those seeking abortions 
after the 20th week of pregnancy are under the age of 15 the 
largest number 367 percent are between 15 and 19 years of age 
and 328 percent are aged 20 to 24 
abortions after the 20th week among women aged 2530 account for 
13 percent and those over age 30 only 119 percent the age of the 
woman was not given in 2 percent of the lateterm cases late 
abortions frequently are chosen by the over30 age group if tests 
show the fetus has a defect such as downs syndrome 
in the supreme courts 54 ruling last week the court upheld the 
right of missouri to require doctors to perform preabortion tests 
on any fetus that could be 20 or more weeks old 
the tests are designed to determine whether the fetus is 
viable that is able to live outside the mothers womb 
viability is directly related to fetal age currently premature 
infants less than 23 weeks old have virtually no chance of survival 
outside the womb and of infants born at 24 weeks only one in 10 
lives despite increasingly sophisticated efforts by experts at 
leading centers 
but the court accepted the position by the state of missouri that 
the best tests for fetal age are only accurate to within about four 
weeks to protect any possibly viable fetus the state required the 
tests to be performed at 20 weeks and the majority of the supreme 
court accepted this reasoning 
most doctors expert in the field however said fetal age can be 
pinpointed within an error range of only 10 days through the use of 
sonography an instrument to makes a picture of the fetus using 
ultrahigh frequency sound waves 
ultrasound pictures enable doctors to take measurements of the 
skull and of the long bones in the body of the fetus which develop 
at a known rate these measurements then are converted to an age 
estimate

nearly 2000 teachers were jailed for 
defying the government and holding labor rallies and president roh 
taewoo said today that it is wrong for educators to form unions 
the outlawed national teachers union said its members would 
resign en masse to protest the government crackdown on sundays 
union rallies 
about 12000 riot police had sealed off downtown sungkyunkwan 
university campus to block a rally of the union by teachers family 
members and students 
several thousand protesters regrouped in front of the national 
assembly and several hundred more staged rallies in central seoul 
shouting antigovernment slogans and clashing with police in side 
streets and alleys 
at least 20 teachers were injured in the protests witnesses said 
police said 1931 people were arrested and 940 were released 
police said many of those jailed would not speak or give their 
names delaying the release of others 
the government said names of teachers taking part in protests 
would be sent to education authorities for discipline about 130 
teachers have been disciplined or dismissed so far this year 
it is unreasonable for teachers to seek unionization roh 
said in a nationwide radio address today 
should education become another arena for struggle damage will 
be inflicted on the next generation roh said this will darken 
our future 
the national teachers union claims membership of 20000 and is 
campaigning for better salaries and working conditions and 
elimination of bureaucracy which the union claims hinders needed 
reform 
the government maintains the union violates the national 
employees law that bans unionizing by government workers and 
teachers education authorities claim some teachers are using the 
union to spread leftist and revolutionary ideas 
there are about 300000 primary and secondary school teachers in 
south korea the average salary is about 550 dollars a month 
the formation may 28 of the teachers union was among the latest 
attempts by workers to gain a larger slice of the economic pie as 
south koreans throw off the yoke of authoritarian rule

the ruling communist party seeking to improve an 
image tarnished by its harsh suppression of dissent today said it 
has expelled hundreds of its members for corruption 
the peoples daily official mouthpiece of the 477 
millionmember party said 452 officials in the southern province of 
guizhou were expelled for corruption during the first half of 1989 
on sunday it was reported that one local party leader in guizhou 
was given the death sentence for selling counterfeit liquor 
the official press recently has highlighted crackdowns on 
corruption as part of the drive to improve its image following its 
violent june 4 crackdown on the studentled movement for democratic 
reform 
the students won wide support among the general populace during 
their sevenweek campaign of class boycotts marches and sitins by 
demanding action to end rampant corruption among chinese officials 
protesters frequently referred to how leaders use their influence 
to obtain good jobs and trips abroad for their children among those 
criticized was senior leader deng xiaoping whose son deng pufang 
formerly had connections with a company singled out for involvement 
in speculation and profiteering 
the peoples daily said today that instances of party members 
involved in bribetaking and graft in guizhou were up 25 percent 
from the first half of 1988 and that top priority should be given 
to investigating the behavior of party members 
it also reported that wang yuntian vice chairman of the 
commodity prices committee in the western province of gansu was 
expelled from the party for making 170000 by profiteering in sugar 
the frontpage article said another gansu official was tricked 
out of 81000 during an unauthorized trip to hong kong one 
official used public funds to buy a private home and another sold 
statesupplied medicine and used the money to hold an elaborate 
funeral for his wife 
another man chairman of a commerce and industry bureau in a 
southern china city was drummed out of the party for trying to 
impede an investigation into a local cigarette trafficking case the 
daily reported 
the paper in a lengthy frontpage commentary acknowledged that 
the recent prodemocracy unrest garnered wide public support 
because some party members cadres and especially a minority of 
leaders were engaged in corrupt practices which made the people very 
dissatisfied 
of course the organizers of the rebellion used anticorruption 
slogans to incite the uncertain public the party will continue its 
fight against corruption it said 
the commentary promised that those found guilty will be 
punished irrespective of who they are for if we dont fight 
corruption then our party will be separated from the people and 
this may lead to chaos 
the rebellion refers to the prodemocracy movement that was 
crushed june 4 when soldiers ran student protesters out of central 
beijing killing hundreds of unarmed civilians hundreds more have 
since been arrested 
the movement also triggered a power struggle within the party 
ending with the purging of party chief zhao ziyang for showing 
sympathy to some of the student demands 
the peoples daily commentary stressed that students who took 
part in demonstrations will be given greater ideological education 
but will not be punished while those who led the 
counterrevolutionary rebellion will not be forgiven 
it urged all chinese to make extra efforts to carry out four 
major tasks set forth by at a meeting last month of the partys 
governing central committee with top priority given to the 
quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion 
the other tasks are promoting the economic opendoor policy 
enhancing ideological work and strengthening the party 
it said young people who lack understanding of the west easily 
accept capitalist propaganda and should be educated to resist 
bourgeois liberalization the attraction to western culture 
this is very important to the future of our country

the skeletons of nine women began showing up a year 
ago along southeastern massachusetts highways but no charges have 
been brought and authorities are frustrated by false leads in the 
serial killings 
its not getting any easier said james martin a spokesman 
for the district attorney time is going on and the trails 
getting colder 
the nine women as well as two others missing and believed dead 
were drug addicts and many supported their habit through 
prostitution in the new bedford area 
but aside from the similar backgrounds few links have been made 
in the slayings since last july the bodies have turned up 
onebyone uncovered by highways workers passersby and police dogs 
sniffing 40 miles of roads 
we started with a lukewarm trail to begin with because the 
bodies were decomposed and little evidence was left at the scene 
martin said 
authorities have been tightlipped about their investigation 
troopers have worked 3500plus overtime hours a forensic 
specialist was brought from washington dc and a special grand 
jury was convened several times last spring to hear testimony 
bristol county district attorney ronald a pina also has 
recruited the fbis special serialmurder investigation unit which 
has been working up a profile of a killer 
but still no arrests 
james a fox a professor of criminal justice at northeastern 
university said leads were particularly hard to find because the 
killer had obscured clues to the scene of the crime 
this is the kind of serial murder where the victims bodies are 
dumped some other place than where they were killed cutting out a 
major form of police investigation the forensics evidence fox 
said 
he said serial killers also were difficult to trace because they 
generally prey on strangers theres no clear motive said fox 
coauthor of mass murder americas growing menace 
martin said the investigation has also been hindered by a hall 
of mirrors 
investigators spend much time at weld square new bedfords 
rundown redlight district they take to the streets after dark and 
by dawn have often questioned scores of prostitutes and drug dealers 
but the stories told by street people often are contradictory and 
frequently fabricated under the influence of alcohol cocaine or 
heroin 
were in a situation right now where were frustrated because a 
couple of weeks ago the da received information from a witness that 
if corroborated could very quickly lead to an indictment martin 
said last week 
weve been out searching for that information and evidence over 
the last couple of weeks and havent found it 
martin declined to give details on the lead but said the tip now 
seems to have fizzled this is not an unfamiliar pattern 
through the last nine months four suspects have emerged although 
the district attorney has never named names the men all have been 
questioned and their links to the weld square community detailed 
extensively in media reports 
two men were held on unrelated assault charges a third appeared 
before a special grand jury and pina has said hed like to question 
the fourth a lawyer who moved to florida last fall 
but fox was skeptical if any of these people were the killer 
my guess is that hed be arrested already he said 
fox also said the odds for finding the killer or killers werent 
improving 
the longer it takes the less likely there is to be an 
arrest fox said

a suspended black priest who defied church 
authorities for the second week by conducting his own brand of 
services incorporating african religious rites says he will try to 
reconcile with the roman catholic church 
the rev george a stallings jr who accuses the church of 
racism and failing its black parishioners told a local television 
station sunday that he planned to begin seeking reconciliation by 
the end of the week so that we are not separated and divided but 
we are all working toward the same goal 
stallings declined to discuss terms of a proposed reconciliation 
but told wrctv i think that this could happen within the next 30 
days 
the rev william lori personal secretary to washington 
archbishop cardinal james a hickey said the church would welcome 
reconciliation 
our hope and our prayer through all of this is 
reconciliation lori said obviously well have to see what the 
proposal contains but remember that the cardinal has always left 
the door open 
a woman who plans to join stallings new africanamerican 
catholic congregation said the catholic church must find a way to 
address the needs of its black parishioners 
i feel the catholic church is going to have to confront this 
issue in some way and now is as good a time as any said christine 
kearney a former worshipper at the catholic parish led until 
recently by stallings she said she plans to join his new imani 
temple 
i dont want to leave the roman catholic church but i do want 
some input into the way i worship thats all he is trying to do 
kearney said 
stallings led services sunday shouting above the din of african 
drums exhorting a packed auditorium to spread the word about the 
new catholic congregation that blends african religious rites 
gospel music and traditional catholic liturgy 
the swaying clapping congregation shouted back as the choir 
swung into praise him a rollicking favorite in many black 
churches 
stallingss backtoback revivalstyle services at imani temple 
marked the second straight week he has said mass in defiance of 
church authorities 
we are not simply making a joyful noise we are not just 
talking about our africanamerican cultural and spiritual heritage 
we are helping you to know the lord in a way you have never known 
him before stallings told parishioners 
weve got to tell people about it theres plenty of lapsed 
catholics plenty of what i call pagan catholics you only see on 
christmas stallings said 
stallings said mass and served communion to more than 2000 
parishioners in the suitland high school auditorium in suburban 
washington summer home of the new church he also asked for 
donations to build a new church 
the 41yearold priest wore a robe trimmed with african printed 
fabric and called on worshipers to invoke the spirits of african 
and black american ancestors 
he poured libations made of earth taken from the grounds of six 
black institutions in philadelphia including a prominent black 
catholic parish 
the service was a repeat of an inaugural service last sunday that 
drew an estimated 3000 people to a larger church and which 
resulted in stallings suspension by the roman catholic archdiocese 
of washington 
stallings spokesman paul dillard said more than 400 people agreed 
to join the church sunday 
in new york worshippers of our lady of charity church in 
brooklyn held their own mass rich in black cultural expression to 
show support for stallings according to todays editions of the new 
york times members of the congregation facing an altar that 
featured the figure of a black jesus spent most of the service on 
their feet swaying and clapping to gospel melodies 
what we did today wasnt all that different from what father 
stallings did last sunday said parishioner jaime cobham we 
just want to worship in our own idiom youll find he has a lot of 
support here 
stallings has said he wants to see formation of an 
africanamerican catholic rite that would still recognize the 
authority of the pope but give individual priests more control over 
catholic liturgy and other matters 
stallings suspension means he is not sanctioned by the church to 
lead mass or perform sacraments it is the strongest step hickey can

president bush cheered by flagwaving 
crowds shouting long live long live honored polish war dead 
and jewish martyrs today and sat down for talks with polish leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski 
bush also planned to address the polish national assembly the 
only parliament in the communist world with a freely elected 
opposition party as he began a 10day european tour 
jaruzelski shook hands with bush at the entrance to the 18th 
century belvedere palace and they went inside for two hours of 
talks 
about 2000 people including poles and american tourists turned 
out on a warm sunny morning to greet bush at a wreathlaying 
ceremony at the tomb of the unknown soldier 
poles shouted long live long live and 100 years 100 
years as bush stepped out of his armored limousine flown here 
from washington and still bearing district of columbia license 
plates 
one man carried a banner of the independent solidarity labor 
movement that was topped with a paper cutout of the statue of 
liberty 
jadwiga staklewska a secretary at the medical academy in lodz 
rode a train for two hours to see bush and began to cry when he 
arrived at the memorial 
i came out of sympathy for bush she said he wants to help 
poland so that convinced me to come only in bush do i see hope for 
our tragic situation 
at the military monument bush and his wife barbara watched as 
two members of an honor guard placed a wreath at the triple 
colonnade memorial 
the president also participated in a wreathlaying ceremony at 
umschlagplatz an almost unmarked memorial of marble walls 
identifying a spot in the warsaw ghetto where jews were rounded up 
for trains bound for nazi death camps 
about 2000 people showed up at the jewish monument where bush 
was accompanied by the only rabbi in poland menachem jaskowitz and 
marek edelman the last surviving commander of the jewish ghetto 
uprising in april 1943 
the walls are inscribed with the family names of some of the more 
than 300000 warsaw jews who were sent to the camps in 194243 
bushs two hours of scheduled talks with jaruzelski polands 
communist party chief preceded a speech before a newly constituted 
parliament where nearly half the members are members of the 
oncebanned solidarity movement 
the polish legislators awaited the first details of bushs new 
but limited aid proposal for polands battered economy 
white house officials said bushs proposals would go somewhat 
further than a package of trade concessions and other incentives 
he announced in april the los angeles times reported today that 
bush was expected to propose the creation of a 100 million fund to 
aid the polish economy and said he will urge other nations to offer 
similar contributions 
sensitive to government fears that his visit might spark huge 
demonstrations and upset the delicate political situation here bush 
told reporters sunday im not going to try to put soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev in a box by throwing strains on the 
warsaw pact 
bush said he was in a little delicate position amid high 
expectations among poles for desperately needed economic aid i 
dont want to overpromise do too little or do too much he said 
upon his arrival sunday night bush said a new and brighter 
future is on the horizon for poland 
poland has started along an ascending path of change 
democratic change the president said and this climb is 
exhilarating but not always be easy and will require further 
sacrifices but if followed it will lead to a renaissance for this 
remarkable nation 
the white house says poles should be prepared to accept austerity 
measures likely bringing increased unemployment and higher prices 
in a country already suffering from 100 percent inflation and a 39 
billion foreign debt 
bushs visit to poland is the first stop on a 10day trip that 
will include a meeting with solidarity leader lech walesa in gdansk 
and the firstever visit by an american president to hungary 
he also will travel to paris for a sevennation economic summit 
and stop briefly in the netherlands 
despite the lateness of his arrival sunday thousands of cheering 
poles lined bushs motorcade route at 11 pm waving americans 
flags and raising the twofinger victory salute of solidarity which 
trounced the communists in parliamentary elections 
jaruzelski who in 1981 imposed martial law to crush the 
solidarity movement was praised by bush for embracing the 
democratic reforms that led to solidaritys election victory 
jaruzelski welcomed bush as an eminent politician and 
statesman 
he told bush you are arriving in a country in which a process 
of basic change is at work you are going to see a poland that is 
following with determination the path of profound sociopolitical 
and economic reforms 
solidarity representatives were among 80 guests invited today to 
an outdoor lunch with bush under a huge tent at the us 
ambassadors residence 
other guests included jaruzelski government leaders academics 
and businessmen 
bush was to be jaruzelskis guest tonight at a formal state

plo leader yasser arafat said his organization no 
longer can consider a plan for palestinian elections because of new 
conditions by israel the new york times reported today 
the likud decision means a deadly blow to elections no matter 
what cosmetic fixes they try to put on it now arafat said in an 
interview with the newspaper from tunis tunisia 
last week israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir bowed to 
hardliners within his likud bloc and agreed to place conditions on 
the planned elections of palestinian representatives to negotiate 
with israel 
the palestine liberation organization reportedly had been 
considering tentative approval of the israeli plan for elections in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip the times said 
before its conditional approval the plo wanted the plan to 
include a role for itself but that was rejected last week by shamir 
arafat said the united states shared much of the blame for 
israels new conditions and he hinted at ending plous 
discussions saying they had accomplished little since they started 
late last year 
the new israeli conditions for elections include that the 
palestinian uprising would cease first that residents of mostly 
arab east jerusalem would not take part in elections that jewish 
settlements will continue in the west bank and gaza and that israel 
would never agree to give up territory 
the us agreed to begin a dialogue with the plo after arafat 
renounced terrorism 
but the times said arafat refused to comment on the bus crash in 
israel last week in which 14 people died after a palestinian grabbed 
the steering wheel and forced the bus to plunge down a ravine 
he charged that armed jewish settlers and vigilantes have joined 
the israeli army in trying to quash the palestinian uprising 
we have not so far given any orders to use weapons but i have 
said many times before that patience has a limit in the face of 
crimes committed by settlers and the army against our people 
arafat said

strawberry fields a corner of central park 
dedicated to the memory of john lennon has attracted a lot of rats 
a newspaper reported today 
i saw a whole family of six or eight one practically ran right 
over my foot longtime upper west side resident joyce searles told 
the new york post 
mrs searles said she has visited the plot for 30 years long 
before it was a memorial to the slain beatle but had never seen a 
rat there before 
now whenever i see a squirrel i jump she said 
i think its shocking and i think it gives a bad impression to 
all the tourists who come here people come here with their children 
all the time mrs searles said 
parks department spokeswoman ivy morrison confirmed that rats 
have made their presence known in strawberry fields 
the park hasnt been using rat poison at strawberry fields 
because of public concern about the environment morrison said 
the poison affects benign park animals and pets as well as rats 
she said 
we are looking into other alternatives we prefer to handle it 
in some natural way morrison said 
one nonpolluting way to attack rats is to put up houses for owls 
in hopes that the predatory birds move in and start feeding on the 
rodents according to morrison 
a 1 million donation from lennons widow yoko ono created 
strawberry fields in an area of central park where the couple used 
to stroll 
lennon was assassinated at his nearby apartment in december 1980

jurors are being asked to solve a mystery that 
has baffled medical investigators for four years the source of the 
deadly bacteria that got into a batch of cheese and killed 48 people 
the panel after hearing conflicting expert testimony must 
decide whether altadena certified dairy should share liability with 
the defunct jalisco mexican products inc for some 100 million in 
victims claims stemming from a 1985 listeriosis outbreak 
more than 100 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of the 18 
stricken adults and 30 infants and stillborn fetuses from one of the 
nations deadliest foodtransmitted epidemics the federal centers 
for disease control in atlanta counted 142 cases of listeriosis from 
jan 1 to aug 15 1985 the epidemic left some survivors with birth 
defects 
altadena the largest dairy in california supplied the raw milk 
to jalisco to make the soft mexicanstyle cheese which was blamed 
for the outbreak of the severe flulike bacterial disease 
victims want altadena to share responsibility for the outbreak 
due to the limited nature of funds available for jalisco a 
number of people involved in litigation are not going to get full 
compensation for their injuries and the death of loved ones unless 
altadena is found responsible said lawyer kimberlee miller 
the trial began three weeks ago in superior judge richard 
lavines courtroom and testimony is expected to conclude this week 
testimony thus far has failed to clarify whether the 
contamination came from altadenas raw milk or from sloppy 
pasteurization and dirty conditions at the jalisco plant 
altadena sold to jalisco a product that contained listeria 
monocytogenese and altadena is partly responsible for this 
epidemic jalisco attorney roy brisbois said in opening statements 
a key witness for jalisco agreed 
we believe the source of the listeriosis outbreak was raw 
milk said epidemiologist laurene mascola a former cdc employee 
stationed in los angeles at the time of the epidemic 
but dairy lawyer raymond novell told the jury that bacteria was 
never found in altadena milk or dairy herds and noted that 
altadena supplied 26 million gallons of milk to its customers 
during the period and only jalisco had the listeriosis outbreak 
the bacteria was found in abundance in refrigerators ants and 
even in the bodies of employees at the jalisco plant he said 
there is no mystery here the mystery is solved if you look at 
the jalisco plant said novell proper pasteurization there would 
have killed the listeria bacteria he said 
jalisco cheese maker jose luis medina conceded under 
crossexamination that he had allowed unlicensed employees to 
pasteurize raw milk the listeria bacteria is killed in the 
pasteurization process 
medina and jalisco owner gary mcpherson pleaded no contest in 
1986 to misdemeanor criminal charges mcpherson was sentenced to 30 
days in jail and medina was sentenced to 60 days they were fined 
about 48000 
listeria bacteria are common in the environment but cause 
illness mainly in people with immature or damaged immune systems 
such as babies elderly people and aids and cancer patients 
listeriosis is fatal about 30 percent of the time but can produce 
mild to severe flulike symptoms including fever abdominal pain 
headaches and nausea 
a separate jury will determine the extent of financial liability 
if the jury finds altadena partially responsible for the outbreak 
numerous separate trials are expected to follow

by sunday along with 40000 acres of private land and other 
parkland 
those pine trees are like kerosenedrenched torches said 
state sen sandy scofield who lives near the area firefighters 
were stymied by the terrain the drought just the nature of a 
pine forest ablaze 
except for one firefighter suffering smoke inhalation and minor 
injuries such as cut hands there have been no injuries in the fire 
officials said 
by early today the fire had burned to within onehalf mile of 
fort robinson the fort established in 1874 that now serves as a 
park lodge 
sioux chief crazy horse was killed by guards in 1877 at the 
former cavalry post the fort also witnessed a cheyenne skirmish in 
1876 in which william f buffalo bill cody fought 
fort robinson superintendent vince rotherham said more than 600 
people were evacuated from the park because of the dense smoke most 
were campers and had gone their way said don mcroberts deputy 
state fire marshal 
orr made state disaster funds available and called in the 
national guard to help fight the lightningsparked fire which began 
saturday afternoon as three small fires but became what one official 
called a roaring inferno

major front nine miles from the sioux county town of harrison could

thousands of poles gave a shouting 
flagwaving welcome to president bush today and expressed hope that 
his visit will give their homeland an economic and emotional boost 
at a time of turbulent change 
about 4000 spectators greeted bush and his wife barbara when 
they arrived for wreathlaying ceremonies at two monuments honoring 
polish war dead and jewish victims of the nazi holocaust before the 
presidents meeting with polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
the ceremonies took place at the tomb of the unknown soldier on 
victory square in central warsaw and about a mile away at 
umschlagplatz the german word for a square on the edge of the 
former warsaw ghetto where more than 300000 jews were loaded onto 
trains bound for the treblinka death camp in 194243 
long live long live shouted people at victory square when 
bushs black armored limousine pulled up in front of the marble 
tomb which was flanked by a military band and honor guard 
some american tourists began singing the starspangled 
banner and a few poles gamely but haltingly joined in 
to shelter themselves from the bright sun some spectators made 
paper hats out of the communist daily newspaper trybuna ludu the 
crowd held up one large solidarity banner topped with a cutout of 
the statue of liberty 
people at both sites spoke of their high expectations for bushs 
visit 
only in bush do i see hope for our tragic situation said 
jadwiga staklewska a medical academy secretary who rode the train 
for two hours from lodz to see the american president 
he wants to help poland so that persuaded me to come she 
said describing how my heart soared when she heard bushs 
speech on polish television when he arrived in warsaw sunday night 
the communists are falling and the only thing that will help 
this country is assistance said construction worker ryszard 
bobrek america is a power and president bush will be able to 
convince europe to do something to help poland 
maria czerwinska a 58yearold retiree at the jewish memorial 
carried a shopping bag emblazoned with the name of the independent 
solidarity trade movement which was legalized again in april 
like everybody i hope that due to the visit we will receive 
some aid and get some help including morally and psychologically 
through his presence she said 
indicating her bag she added this would not have been 
possible before i was a member of underground solidarity and now i 
am a member of legal solidarity 
all the time i had the feeling that changes were not real 
she said this lack of faith is very widespread but now 
there is some hope for instance the senate is our senate our 
hope 
she was referring to polands new freely elected senate in 
which solidarity won all but one of the 100 seats 
although the poles said they looked to america for support many 
said their country needs to buckle down and help itself 
i hope things will be better but to a large extent it is up to 
poles themselves to work properly said urszula kozik a 
17yearold aspiring artist 
it would be good if people saw a motive for good work so that 
working would bring better profits she said 
at umschlagplatz bush was accompanied by marek edelman a key 
solidarity figure who is the last surviving commander of the jewish 
ghetto uprising in april 1943 
after the wreathlaying ceremony there edelman said he told bush 
that the united states would have to make economic contributions to 
help make sure that nothing like the holocaust occurs again 
any dictatorship can lead to such a situation edelman said 
rich america must sometimes give a chunk so that the world can 
become free so that these things do not happen again

chagrined by recent gains of israeli 
hardliners three top state department officials are traveling to 
israel next week to determine the prospects of a usbacked 
election plan for palestinians in the occupied west bank and gaza 
the mission is designed to see where the israeli government 
stands after the rightwing likud bloc forced prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to place strict limits on the election plan said the 
source 
finance minister shimon peres who heads the leftleaning labor 
party today responded to the likud actions by urging that his party 
quit the governing coalition in protest such a move could bring 
down the government and eight months after the last national 
elections force a new vote 
the likud bloc last week forced shamir to modify his election 
proposal by among other things excluding 140000 palestinians 
living in east jerusalem from the balloting the palestine 
liberation organization and the arab league reacted by declaring the 
plan null and urging the united states to remove its support 
the us delegation will be led by deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger and will include john kelly assistant 
secretary of state for middle eastern affairs and dennis ross the 
departments top policy planner a diplomatic source said he spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
kelly who was recently confirmed for his post was expected to 
travel to the middle east early next month but his trip was pushed 
up in view of the developments in israel said the source ross is 
traveling to europe to meet secretary of state james baker who joins 
president bush for his trip to eastern europe and the paris economic 
summit 
at a news conference in brunei on friday baker described the 
likud restrictions as not helpful to the election plans 
prospects 
we will continue to try to work with this proposal because we 
always thought it offered us the best possibility of getting the 
parties into negotiations said one official traveling with baker 
but he added theres no doubt that this makes it harder to 
make progress 
the elections would be designed to choose palestinian 
representatives authorized to negotiate with israel a settlement of 
the future of the territories occupied by israel since the 1967 
arabisraeli war 
the official said that if the election idea proves unworkable 
the united states may look more closely at proposals to advance the 
peace process through an international conference on the middle 
east the soviet union as well as many us allies in europe 
supports such a conference which would serve as an umbrella for 
direct arabisraeli negotiations 
but israel objects fearing international pressure and the 
united states has been reluctant to grant the kremlin a role in the 
largely usdominated middle east peace process

cabinet minister who called women useless in politics and six 
women from another party went to the prime ministers office to 
lodge their protest 
the japan communist party said hisao horinouchi should be fired 
as agriculture forestry and fisheries minister for trampling on 
fundamental social principles a party official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the party 
also called on prime minister sousuke uno who has been in office 
only a month to resign because of the controversy 
all 44 communist party members of parliament presented the 
request to chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa kyodo news 
service said 
the communist party said in a statement that it is intolerable 
to the japanese people that the government of a nation is being 
handled by these people 
meanwhile six woman from the japan socialist party the nations 
main opposition group called at unos office speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the quality of horinouchi as a cabinet member is severely 
questioned he quoted asae uemura a socialist member of the tokyo 
metropolitan assembly as saying in a message meant for uno 
the six women were told they could not meet with uno because of 
his tight schedule the official added 
in a campaign speech friday for fellow members of the governing 
liberal democratic party horinouchi said women are useless in the 
world of politics 
in a nationally televised news conference on saturday he 
retracted the remark and apologized 
local news reports said he was urged to do so by uno who feared 
the impact of the remark on women voters in the july 23 elections 
for half the seats in the 252seat upper house of parliament 
uno himself has come under attack from womens groups following 
allegations that he kept paid mistresses he has denied doing 
anything immoral

influencepeddling scandal and an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax 
in tokyo metropolitan assembly elections july 2 socialistbacked 
candidates tripled their strength in the 128member body from 12 
seats to 36 while the governing party lost 20 seats leaving it with 
43 
the turnout of women voters surpassed that of men which analysts 
attributed partly to the mistress scandal

uno recommendations to increase the number of female representatives 
on government advisory committees officials said 
female representatives made up only 67 percent of the 
governments policy advisory committees as of march 31 the report 
by the womens office of the prime ministere said 
the report set a goal of increasing women representatives on 
government committees to 10 percent by the end of 1990 and to 15 
percent by 2000

the man accused of killing prime 
minister olof palme proclaimed his innocence today but a court 
rejected a defense plea that he be freed for lack of evidence 
christer pettersson is accused of shooting palme as the prime 
minister was walking home after seeing a movie with his wife 
lisbeth on feb 28 1986 
the 42yearold defendant asked for a final statement ended it 
saying my name is christer pettersson and i did not kill olof 
palme that is for the moment the only happy thing in this case 
mrs palme identified pettersson in court as the man she saw a 
few feet away immediately after her husband fell with a fatal 
gunshot wound in the back pettersson said he was 17 miles away at 
the time 
the court adjourning the trial after five weeks said it would 
announce on thursday the date when it will pronounce a verdict it 
rejected a defense demand for petterssons immediate release 
it must simply not happen that an innocent person is sentenced 
and that we have a miscarriage of justice defense counsel 
arne liljeros told the stockholm district court during final 
arguments today 
liljeros said there was no evidence to support what he called the 
unreliable testimony of mrs palme and five other witnesses who said 
they saw pettersson at or near the scene of the shooting 
the prosecution had no murder weapon no fingerprints nor any 
trace of gunpowder stains on petterssons clothes to link him to the 
crime liljeros said 
pettersson was being tried by a tribunal of two judges and six 
jurors all of whom have an equal vote on the verdict a majority 
vote is sufficient pettersson faces a possible life sentence but 
in practice all life sentences are commuted to less than 20 years 
liljeros denounced mrs palme for what he said was her lack of 
cooperation during the investigation and for setting conditions 
before appearing in court he also criticized the court for 
accepting the conditions 
theres no excuse for her behavior here in court liljeros 
complained her rigid demands and lack of respect for normal 
practice in this case should disqualify her evidence 
mrs palme who appeared june 19 demanded that pettersson be 
removed from the courtroom while she testified and that her 
testimony not be recorded on tape the court agreed to close an 
adjoining press area but rejected her demand that she testify 
behind closed doors 
pettersson was brought into the courtroom at the end of her 
testimony for her identification she said she was certain he was 
the man she saw when she looked up for help as her husband was dying 
liljeros complained that he was prevented from watching her 
during a videotaped police lineup when she first identified 
pettersson 
she also refused to view the videotape again in the courtroom 
said liljeros 
the attorney pleaded with the court to give credence to a defense 
witness algot asell who claimed he saw pettersson at a suburban 
train station about the time of the shooting and was the only 
witness to support petterssons alibi 
pettersson testified he was in town that night to get a supply of 
drugs on the way home he fell asleep and missed his regular stop 
his late arrival home was cited by the prosecution as showing that 
he had time to commit the murder

syrian and christian gunners duelled with 
howitzer shells and rockets across beirut today and street gun 
battles between rival shiite factions ebbed into sporadic sniping 
in south lebanon palestinian and leftist lebanese guerrillas 
attacked a patrol of israeli troops and allied militiamen prompting 
a massive counterattack that left three guerillas dead police said 
police said syrian artillery emplacements in west beirut and 
north lebanon shelled christian residential districts and the coast 
north of beirut at dawn maintaining a fourmonth blockade of the 
310squaremile christian enclave 
gunners of the mostly christian troops of army commander gen 
michel aoun retaliated by shelling the seaside districts of ein 
mreisseh and maramel said a police spokesman he cannot be named 
under standing regulations 
he said two people were killed and five wounded in the overnight 
bombardment raising the overall toll to 405 killed and 1581 
wounded since the syrianchristian confrontation broke out march 8 
police said syrian troops in charge of west beiruts security 
deployed in the coastal residential districts of jnah and ouzai 
restoring traffic between beirut and south lebanon and disengaging 
warring militiamen of the prosyrian amal movement and the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
syrian officers on the scene said they do not plan to go into the 
narrow alleyways of both shiite slums while the two warring factions 
were staging funerals for their dead 
occasional sniper fire marred the truce called at midnight after 
daylong clashes with mortars rocketpropelled grenades and machine 
guns that trapped thousands of sunbathers on nearby beaches 
they were evacuated at sundown when the syrian command arranged 
a onehour mercy ceasefire and sent in armored personnel 
carriers that brought out the trapped sunbathers 
police said 10 people were killed and 23 wounded in sundays 
hostilities that raised the overall toll to 18 killed and 51 
wounded since the current amalhezbollah confrontation erupted 10 
days ago 
the two factions have been vying for dominance of lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest moslem sect 
the spiraling hostilities made it clear that arab league 
troubleshooter lakhdar ibrahimi failed to make a headway during four 
days of talks with christian and moslem leaders in beirut 
ibrahimi represented an arab league committee seeking a solution 
to the 14yearold civil war 
the independent beirut newspaper annahar said aoun rejected 
syrias conditions for lifting the enclaves siege 
these conditions annahar said included the formation of a 
security committee made up of lebanese and arab league 
representatives to oversee the ceasefire search ships heading to 
christian ports and remove surfacetosurface missiles from the 
enclave 
syria contends aoun has recently acquired the missiles from iraq 
syrias main arab foe the missiles which have a range of 43 miles 
can hit the syrian capital of damascus from lebanons central 
mountains 
also today druse parliamentary deputy bashir awar 76 died of a 
heart attack reducing the number of surviving members of lebanons 
99seat parliament to 74 
the current unicameral house was elected for a fouryear term in 
1972 the civil war prevented new elections and parliament had been 
extending its term once every two years 
the parliament however has been unable to convene for the last 
11 months to elect a successor to former president amin gemayel 
whose term expired sept 22 
that created a political crisis that split the government along 
sectarian lines and generated the fighting between christians and 
syria

marine biologists today studied the body of a 
bottlenosed dolphin for clues to why it strayed into the east river 
and then swam 50 miles up the hudson river where it died 
a preliminary look at the dead dolphin shows it had severe and 
significant skin lesions and skin sloughing because of the fresh 
water said dr samuel sadove of the okeanos ocean research 
foundation 
there are also a number of old healed wounds that are quite 
large he said 
the dolphin which sadove said was an adult female weighing 
between 500 and 600 pounds was found floating sunday afternoon in 
the hudson river off the town of garrison about 50 miles north of 
new york city 
the mammals death was not totally unexpected sadove said 
adding that it was last seen alive on saturday 
the dolphin was first noticed on june 20 in the east river off 
manhattan it stayed there for about 11 days attracting a steady 
stream of curious onlookers 
the gray 5footlong animal resisted the efforts of biologists 
who tried to drive it out to open seas by banging on pipes in the 
water 
two weeks ago the dolphin headed north up the hudson forcing 
scientists to scuttle plans to scare it toward the ocean by playing 
recorded killerwhale sounds underwater 
sadove declined to speculate on what caused the animals death

a congressman asked to investigate 
information leaks during the probe of the gun turret explosion 
aboard the battleship iowa says he found no evidence that navy 
officials acted improperly 
i have found nothing to indicate in my inquiry that the navy 
at least officially has acted irresponsibly said rep glenn 
poshard dill 
poshard was asked to investigate by the father of gunners mate 
3rd class kendall truitt a sailor who reportedly has been the focus 
of the navys investigation truitts father lives in poshards 
district 
the april 19 explosion killed 47 men including gunners mate 
clayton hartwig who had named truitt as the sole beneficiary of a 
50000 life insurance policy 
news reports have cited unidentified sources as saying the navy 
was investigating the possibility of a homosexual relationship 
between the two men there also was speculation that hartwig may 
have caused the blast to commit suicide or that truitt had 
orchestrated it to kill hartwig 
poshard said saturday that he is satisfied with the navys 
handling of the probe although he added that he felt sorry for 
truitt 
kendall truitt is a young man caught up in the most unfortunate 
of circumstances poshard said i feel a great deal of sympathy 
for truitt because he and his family have had to endure more than 
most people endure in ten lifetimes and perhaps all of it 
unjustly 
he said the navy is still investigating the leaks 
what we have here is a bureaucratic investigation too large to 
control every comment from every source poshard said i cant 
point my finger at the navy and i cant at the media i dont know 
whos to blame 
truitt last week criticized the navys investigation and 
complained of harassment by the navy and the news media he also 
said drug use was rampant on the iowa and that he and hartwig were 
among the few in the turret crew who did not use drugs 
a navy spokeswoman in norfolk va declined comment on the case

the power and potential of this moment was first made clear to me 
when i saw a photo a worldwide photo flashed all around the world 
a photo of general jaruzelski senator leader lech walesa shoulder 
to shoulder solidarity leader lech walesa shoulder to shoulder 
at the opening session of this parliament committed to new progress 
in poland believe me that sent a wonderful signal all around the 
world 
poland and the united states are bound it is often said by ties 
of kinship and culture but our peoples are linked by more than 
sentiment 
the may 3rd constitution of 1791 set poland ahead of her peers 
ahead of her time in the pursuit of freedom and democratic ideas 
just as our constitution the american constitution of 1787 set new 
standards for protection of the rights of the individual 
for decades beginning with the versailles peace conference the 
united states has stood for polish independence freedom 
prosperity and we are proud of our early and longstanding 
commitment to polish selfdetermination as americas president i 
am here today to reaffirm that proud commitment 
i understand something of the work you are commencing for i 
began my own public service in the american congress democratically 
chosen legislatures are among mankinds greatest forums for debate 
and dialogue and while ive been to poland before i did not expect 
to return so soon nor to such altered circumstances in your country 
and so too perhaps many of you didnt expect to be here serving in 
this or any polish parliament and your achievement has surpassed all 
expectations and has earned all our admiration 
our meeting today bears witness to the character of our age some 
450 years ago when the polish astronomer copernicus came to 
understand the natural order of the planets and had the courage to 
question accepted wisdom the world was changed forever 
from this year forward as poland works to reaffirm the natural 
order of man and government so too will poland be changed 
forever for today the scope of political and economic change in 
poland is indeed copernican a fundamental change in perspective 
that places the people at the center a new understanding that the 
governed are the true source of lasting social peace and economic 
prosperity around which government revolves and exists to serve 
poland has a rich democratic heritage the may 3rd constitution 
was a stroke of genius today at the dawn of the documents third 
century youre called upon to match its genius with contemporary 
action to make a peaceful transition toward political and economic 
renewal through representative government that expresses the will of 
the people 
i said a few weeks ago here in europe that east and west have 
arrived at the end of one era and at the beginning of another 
chairman jaruzelski recently said of poland that the life of the 
nation has undergone deep changes society has the full right to ask 
when a ray of sun will shine over poland in truth this applies not 
just to poland but to the entirety of relations between east and 
west 
a profound cycle of turmoil and great change is sweeping the 
world from poland to the pacific it is sometimes inspiring as here 
in warsaw and sometimes its agonizing as in china today but the 
magnitude of change we sense around the world compels us to look 
within ourselves and to god to forge a rare alloy of courage and 
restraint

the future beckons with both hope and uncertainty poland and 
hungary find themselves at a crossroads each has started down its 
own road to reform without guarantee of easy success the people of 
these nations and the courage of their leaders command our 
admiration 
the way is hard but the moment is right both internally and 
internationally for poland to walk its own path 
on the day solidarity was restored i spoke of my support and 
admiration for the political experiment just getting underway in 
poland you have since proceeded further along that road including 
holding the remarkable elections that produced this parliament and 
let us consider what your experiment may mean not just for poland 
but for europe and for the entire world 
the divided world of the modern age began here right here in 
poland 50 years ago this summer your country and then nearly all 
of europe was first besieged and then occupied by totalitarian 
despotic forces 
a courageous poland was our ally in that fearful time franklin 
roosevelt and winston churchill devised the atlantic charter which 
outlined principles on which we hoped to build a better world 
including freedom from want and fear and the right of peoples to 
choose the form of government under which they will live but as you 
know better than anyone the world that we sought then was not to be 
stalinist systems were imposed over a third of the continent the 
cold war began the countries of the west organized themselves in 
defense of democratic principles and we proposed taht the marshall 
plan include eastern europe but again that was not to be 
the western strategy our strategy of containment was a means but 
was never an end in itself there was no substitute for a free and 
united europe and we did not forget the frustrated and lost hopes of 
1945 nor the promise of a better world neither did the polish 
people youve been a crucible of conflict youre now becoming a 
vessel for change 
poland is where the cold war began and now the people of poland 
can help bring the division of europe to an end the time has come 
to move beyond containment to a world too long deferred a better 
world 
and now at long last two developments have allowed us to redeem 
the principles of the atlantic charter for which the united states 
and poland fought as allies 
one is the manifest failure of the classic stalinist system and 
the other is the indomitable will of the people through leaders in 
poland and hungary who are working to overcome the mistakes of the 
past with honesty creativity and yes courage the world watches 
in admiration 
and now in part because of what youre doing here the genuine 
opportunity exists for all of us to build a europe which many 
thought was destroyed forever in the 1940s that europe the europe 
of our children will be open whole and free 
we can make it so in two ways 
first a new eastwest relationship must rest on greatly reduced 
levels of arms i notice what general jaruzelski said on that point 
and i support him we in the west have proposed dramatic reductions 
in conventional armed forces in europe reductions that promise to 
transform the military map of europe and diminish the very threat of 
war 
the new willingness in moscow to accept this western framework 
for reductions in troops and tanks and aircraft and other categories 
of weapons gives us hope that the negotiations in vienna will 
succeed a good beginning has been made constructive proposals are 
being offered on both sides we are determined to push hard for an 
early and successful conclusion to these talks 
second reductions in military forces will go further and be more 
sustainable if they take place in parallel with political change 
excessive levels of arms we believe are the symptom and not the 
source of political tensions

in europe those tensions spring from an unnatural and cruel 
division 
polands decision to embrace political reform and hungarys 
movement in the same direction thus have great importance beyond 
their borders by creating political structures legitimized by 
popular will 
by that your reforms can be the foundation of stability 
security and prosperity not just here but in all of europe now 
and into the next century 
mikhail gorbachev has written universal security rests on the 
recognition of the right of every nation to choose its own path of 
social development and on the renunciation of interference in the 
domestic affairs of other states a nation may choose either 
capitalism or socialism this is its sovereign right end of 
quotation 
in principle i agree but i might well have said that the people 
of a nation may freely choose either a freemarket economy or 
socialism that is their right 
and so the west works not to disrupt not to interfere not to 
threaten any nations security but to help forge closer and 
enduring ties between poland and the rest of europe 
as a result of the roundtable accords polands fate lies more 
than ever in polish hands and there it must ever remain 
your responsibility for your countrys future is immense 
polands friends including the american people want poland to be 
free prosperous democratic independent true to the best 
tradition of your nations past 
and this regime this regime is moving forward with a sense of 
realism and courage in a time of great difficulty and challenge 
lech walesa and solidarity are deeply committed to institutions 
in poland that will serve all its people 
this parliament by its very existence is advancing pluralism 
and the church has served as a source of spiritual guidance and 
unity in turbulent times 
but above all there are the people of poland people who are 
steadfastly working toward productive change 
and yet even under the best circumstances representative 
government has its own challenges that require patience tolerance 
and give and take between political opponents but its virtue is 
that it grants legitimacy to leaders and their policies it gives 
governments and societies the mandate to make hard choices and 
through their involvement it gives the people a stake in the 
choices that are made 
for over 200 years americans have wrestled over political and 
economic interests over individual and civil rights and the role 
of a loyal opposition 
democracy is not a conclusion its a process and perfecting it 
never ends but history has taught americans one very clear lesson 
democracy works 
we understand in my country the enormous economic problems you 
face economic privation is a danger that can threaten any great 
democratic experiment and i must speak honestly economic reform 
and recovery cannot occur without sacrifices 
even in an economy as productive as ours we still debate the 
roles and limits of government how to regulate the private sector 
without discouraging innovation how to reduce our own enormous 
budget deficit how to balance workers needs and industrial 
efficiency how to handle the painful disruptions of change for the 
sake of productivity the sake of progress for the sake of 
prosperity 
the reform of the polish economy presents an historic challenge 
there can be no substitute for polands own efforts but i want to 
stress to you today that poland is not alone given the enormity of 
this moment the united states stands ready to help as you help 
yourselves 
in hamtramck michigan three months ago i outlined a policy of 
support for the reforms then just beginning in poland i proposed 
specific steps carefully chosen to recognize the reforms underway 
here and to encourage reforms yet to come it is a policy built on 
dynamic interplay of progress in poland and western engagement and 
not on unsound credits made without regard to necessary reforms 
that was the record of the 1970s

romania today accused president bush of 
seeking to destabilize east european countries in an official 
editorial coinciding with his visit to reformoriented poland and 
hungary 
it is quite obvious that president bush urges 
destabilization in socialist countries said an editorial in the 
government daily romania libera 
bushs positions on the reform flagrantly run counter to the 
principles and norms of international laws said an english 
translation of the editorial carried by the official agerpres news 
agency and monitored in vienna 
bush arrived in warsaw sunday and travels on to budapest tuesday 
for the first visit to hungary by a us president 
communist party chief nicolae ceausescu is one of the most 
adamant opponents within the east bloc of political and economic 
reforms like those under way in the soviet union poland and hungary 
the editorial came just two days after leaders of the seven 
warsaw pact countries issued a communique in which they declared 
they would not interfere in each others affairs 
however the official romanian editorial applied the agreement to 
eastwest relations alleging attempts to interfere in the 
domestic affairs of the socialist communist countries it 
referred to the west in general and the united states in particular 
romania in the 1960s and 1970s drew praise in the west for 
ceausescus maverick foreign policy and presidents richard nixon and 
gerald ford visited bucharest in 1969 and 1975 respectively at that 
time romania was criticized by its warsaw pact allies for hosting 
the two presidents 
bush visited romania as vice president in september 1983 
however romania has in recent years increasingly come under fire 
both from western nations and from neighboring hungary and 
yugoslavia for alleged human rights violations 
last year the united states suspended romanias mostfavored 
nation trading status 
bush has pledged us support for reforms in poland and hungary 
but in an interview last week with hungarian journalists he 
emphasized that washington should not meddle in the domestic affairs 
of warsaw pact nations or prescribe what kind of reform to undertake

dozens of extremist moslem fundamentalists 
were arrested today for allegedly turning a religious summer school 
into a terrorist training camp for boys a security source said 
the source said police arrested 57 people early today to break up 
the school for children as young as 7 years old at zagazig capital 
of the nile delta province of sharkiya the city is about 50 miles 
northeast of cairo 
about 40 boys ages 7 to 15 were recruited by extremists who 
trained them in the use of violence and incited them with lectures 
to hate the present system of government said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he gave no specifics on that but said the extremists exploited 
the boys summer school holidays which began last month for 
lessons in terrorism he said the lessons occurred in the courtyard 
of a religious institute but refused to identify the institute 
moslem fundamentalists advocate implementation of sharia the 
ethical and legal code enshrined in islams holy book the koran and 
the teachings of the prophet mohammed the government maintains that 
more than 90 percent of its laws already conform to sharia and that 
the rest will be brought in line gradually 
president hosni mubaraks government systematically cracks down 
on violenceprone fundamentalists invoking an emergency law in 
force since moslem extremists assassinated mubaraks predecessor 
anwar sadat in cairo in 1981 the law gives police wide powers 
including detention without trial 
interior minister zaki badr whose ministry is responsible for 
internal security said in april that more than 1000 moslem 
extremists were in custody there has been no official update since

poland and the united states need not repeat that our efforts 
will be carefully targeted in support of an emerging new poland 
weve made progress on the steps announced at hamtramck and this 
is where we stand 
legislation is well underway that will help polish exporters 
compete more effectively in the us market through generalized 
systems of preferences and that will authorize our overseas private 
investment corporation to operate in poland providing investment 
insurance and setting up missions to stimulate us investment in 
joint ventures here 
the united states is proposing a private business agreement that 
will promote contacts between polands growing private business 
sector and its american counterparts we hope to conclude an 
agreement soon to build on what promises to be an unprecedented 
opportunity 
there is great interest and excitement in the united states about 
what youre doing in poland and a clearcut desire to help the 
reform process i hosted a white house symposium on july 6 to bring 
together citizens of my country interested in promoting investment 
trade and academic exchange with poland and hungary and i can 
assure you that more than ever before the american people will be 
involved in your democratic experiment 
ive said that as poland reforms itself the us will respond 
much has happened even in the short time since hamtramck so today 
im pleased to announce that we plan to do more and go farther for 
the sake of a stable and prosperous poland 
first i will propose at the upcoming economic summit in paris 
that the nations of the summit that summit seven intensify their 
coordination and concerted action to promote democratic reform in 
poland and hungary and to help manage compassionately the process of 
change 
we will work with our partners at the summit moving quickly with 
increased western aid and technical assistance this concerted 
action will complement existing institutions like the world bank 
the paris club and imf and address needed economic reforms credits 
management and training initiatives social safety nets housing and 
other issues important to poland 
second i will ask the united states congress to provide a 100 
million fund to capitalize and invigorate the polish private sector 
and we will encourage parallel contributions from other nations of 
the economic summit 
third i will encourage the world bank to move ahead with 325 
million in economicallyviable loans to help polish agriculture and 
industry reach the production levels they are so clearly capable of 
and fourth i will ask my counterparts in the west to support an 
early and generous rescheduling of polish debt this could provide 
deferral of debt payments amounting to about 5 billion this year 
if our allies and friends in the paris club agree to join us in 
offering liberalized terms i plan to discuss this issue with my 
colleagues at the paris summit 
fifth economic progress should not come at the expense of our 
common heritage our common inheritance the environment in fact 
sound ecology and a strong economy can and must coexist air and 
water pollution know no boundaries and this concern is worldwide 
almost two years ago i visited krakow and your formal royal 
capital a city recognized by unesco as an international treasure 
today krakow is under seige by pollution its priceless monuments 
are being destroyed krakow must be reclaimed and the united states 
will help and ill ask the congress for 15 million for a 
cooperative venture with poland to help fight air and water 
pollution there 
sixth and finally when i begin my remarks when i began them 
i mentioned the shared cultured heritage of our two nations today 
im proud to announce that my country proud to announce that the 
united states will establish a cultural and information center in 
warsaw and will ask poland to establish a similar center in the 
united states this will be the first time that either of our two 
countries will be able to conduct educational and cultural programs 
outside of our embassies and consulates 
the elections which brought us all of us together here today 
mean that the path the polish people have chosen is that of 
political pluralism and economic rebirth 
the road ahead is a long one but it is the only road which leads 
to prosperity and social peace 
polands progress along this road will show the way toward a new 
era throughout europe an era based on common values and not just 
geographic proximity 
the western democracies will stand with the polish people and 
other peoples of this region 
democracy has captured the spirit of our time like all forms of 
government though it may be defended democracy can never be 
imposed 
we believe in democracy for without doubt though democracy may 
be a dream for many it remains in my view the destiny of man 
two hundred years ago demcratic constitutions were adopted by 
three nations embodying the powerful influence of the enlightenment 
as a testament to ideas that endure 
the american constitution was first and has stood the test of 
history for the over 200 years of our existence as a republic 
constitutional democracy in france began two centuries ago this 
summer and in a few days leaders from all over the world will be in 
paris to celebrate the anniversary of its birth 
on may 3rd 1991 the polish constitution will also be 200 years 
old your constitution of 1791 was crushed but never forgotten and 
now this generations calling is to redeem the promise of a free 
polish republic poland has not been lost so long as the polish 
spirit lives 
america wishes you well as you face the tough problems today i 
salute general jaruzelski for his leadership and his extraordinary 
hospitality to me 
i salute the leaders and members of these two great legislative 
bodies 
god in his infinite wisdom and love is with us in this chamber 
may god bless you and your efforts long live poland long live 
poland thank you very much

polands new national assembly made its 
warm welcome of president bush evident today in unorthodox fashion 
for a legislative body 
it serenaded him 
as bush and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski took their 
seats at the front of the combined meeting of the senate and sejm a 
low stirring rose up in the rear of the chamber 
soon the hall was filled with the melody of sto lat a 
traditional polish song that is the local variant of for hes a 
jolly good fellow 
the strains grew louder as the song drew to a close with even 
jaruzelski appearing to join in for the last refrain 
the song goes 
a hundred years a hundred years 
let him live live for us 
once again once again 
let him live for us 
bush nodded in acknowledgement of the melody before delivering a 
speech promising poland a 100 million aid package

for the first time in 50 years the government is 
producing accurate maps of the capital the official tass news 
agency said today 
in the past maps of the city were deliberately distorted and 
among the manifestations of the policy of secrecy which quite 
often covered up lawlessness and arbitrariness tass said 
as a result tass said maps failed to be adequate guides both 
for tourists and muscovites 
a familiar saying among soviets that is often passed on to 
foreigners is if you dont know where you are you dont belong 
there 
but the new map of moscow prepared by the main board of 
geodesy and cartography on the strength of a topographic survey of 
the city represents moscow as it is in actual fact for the first 
time in half a century tass said 
the news agency said there are more than 3100 avenues squares 
streets and lanes in moscow every street of the city is shown on 
the new map and its name is listed in a supplement which is 
published as a separate booklet tass said 
it did not say where or when the map would be made available to 
the public

mine early today marred the start of a coolingoff period called by 
the head of the united mine workers union in an effort to ease 
tensions in a wildcat walkout

a car and injuring several security personnel said cliff nuckols

a pittston coal group inc office trailer and another going off on a 
private yard state police reported no injuries were caused and no 
one was arrested virginia state police sgt mike frank said

charleston said union officials were unavailable for comment this 
morning 
more than 37000 miners have been on industrywide wildcat 
walkouts since june 12 in eight states protesting pittstons 
refusal to sign a national contract negotiated by the umw and other 
companies that are members of the bituminous coal operators 
association 
pittstons miners without a contract since feb 1 1988 have 
been on strike since april 5 
miners say the wildcat strikes are being staged because pittston 
is not dealing fairly with the union pittston officials have denied 
that 
the violence came three days after umw president richard trumka 
called for all umw members east of the mississippi river to stay 
away from work for a threeday memorial period in an attempt to 
calm the volatile situation in the coal fields

three union leaders were jailed for a time in virginia for 
encouraging miners and their supporters to block pittstons coal 
production through acts of civil disobedience 
trumka said court orders for the umw to end sitdown 
demonstrations against pittston and fines that double every time 
the union is found in violation are an economic death warrant

fifteen south pacific nations alarmed at 
the depletion of tuna stocks by drift net fishing today asked help 
to force japan and taiwan to end the practice known as the wall of 
death 
in spain fishermen and greenpeace activists today tried to block 
the port of cartagena to protest the governments failure to stop 
the illegal use of driftnets in the mediterranean the environmental 
group said 
the pacific leaders are alarmed that drift net fishing also 
called gill net fishing is ravaging fish stocks and threatening the 
pacifics economic future said cook islands prime minister geoffrey 
henry 
henry briefing reporters after the opening session of twoday 
annual conference of the south pacific forum on this south pacific 
island said the pacific island nations back an australian proposal 
for an international convention banning driftnet fishing 
the technique uses nets up to 30 miles long and 50 feet deep 
which are set adrift by fishing boats for later collection it has 
been likened to strip mining of the ocean 
the method is designed to catch albacore tuna by their gills in 
the nets fine mesh but fish researchers say it also catches vast 
numbers of dolphins whales seals turtles and squid 
with stocks of southern pacific albacore tuna estimated to be 
exhausted in two years henry said the pacific leaders found that 
urgent action is needed 
henry said the pacific forum leaders particularly objected to 
what he called japans intransigence in refusing to end drift net 
fishing 
henry said the conference will increase surveillance of their

labor party leaders recommended today their 
party quit the governing coalition to protest the likud blocs 
tougher conditions for peace talks with the palestinians 
the move could bring down the government and eight months after 
the last national elections force a new vote 
labor leader and finance minister shimon peres told his 
leftleaning partys 120member leadership bureau that he wants to 
convene labors governing central committee as soon as possible 
and to ask it to endorse the move 
the bureaus recommendations usually are endorsed by the central 
committee 
last week prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
met and toughened its conditions for elections in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip in which palestinians would choose leaders to 
negotiate limited selfrule with israel 
the hardened position has drawn fire from washington and the 
palestine liberation organization egypt told the united states on 
sunday that shamirs peace plan would escalate the tension and 
violence in the occupied territories 
peres proposed sending a letter to shamir saying the likud stance 
seriously harmed the governments peace initiative and that his 
party has concluded it would be proper to dismantle the present 
government 
peres said shamirs speech at last weeks likud forum gave in 
to the opinions and positions of those who oppose the agreed 
initiative those who want to torpedo it 
the labor leadership bureau which includes the partys 
lawmakers approved peres proposal by a 452 vote six bureau 
members abstained and many others did not return to the session for 
the vote some saying they stayed away because they oppose leaving 
the government 
shamirs top aide yossi ahimeir told the associated press the 
prime minister was still hopeful that the bottom line would not be 
a labor withdrawal 
there is no place for dismantling the government this is not 
in israels interests this is not in the interests of peace such a 
move only means a delay in the peace process he said 
in may the coalition cabinet had endorsed the peace initiative 
for elections in the west bank and gaza strip 
on wednesday however likud hawks led by trade minister ariel 
sharon forced shamir to adopt the conditions that critics said would 
end chances of palestinian acceptance 
under likuds new conditions no elections would be held in the 
occupied lands until the end of the palestinian uprising which in 
its 19 months has claimed the lives of more than 550 palestinians 
and 33 israelis 
likuds new conditions also specify that a program of building 
jewish settlements in the occupied territories will go forward the 
united states has called the settlements obstacles to peace 
in addition shamir ruled out a key palestinian demand that 
140000 arabs living in the annexed east jerusalem be allowed to 
participate in the balloting 
likud also reiterated its opposition to the creation of a 
palestinian state a goal of the palestine liberation organization 
plo leader yasser arafat said the new conditions make the 
election plan unacceptable 
the likud decision means a deadly blow to elections no matter 
what cosmetic fixes they try to put on it now the new york times 
quoted him as saying sunday in tunisia 
arafat said the united states shared much of the blame for 
israels new conditions and he hinted at ending plous 
discussions saying they had accomplished little since they began 
last year 
shamir maintains the principles voted by likud on wednesday do 
not affect the peace plan but secretary of state james a baker iii 
has criticized the partys action as not helpful to the peace 
process 
israel television reported sunday that highranking us 
officials were urging labor not to leave the government 
a highranking state department delegation plans to visit israel 
in 10 days to discuss the future of the governments proposal for 
elections in the occupied lands

president bush today became the first 
american leader to address the polish national assembly the 
communist worlds only parliament with a freely elected opposition 
party 
nearly half the legislators are supporters of the independent 
solidarity trade union movement who were seated july 4 following the 
east blocs freest elections in four decades 
the national assembly is the result of unprecedented april 
accords reached by communist authorities and the solidarityled 
opposition the agreement created a senate which combined with the 
existing sejm or parliament to form the national assembly 
the pact which lifted a sevenyear ban on solidarity allowed 
independent candidates to contest all 100 senate seats and 161 
places in the 460seat sejm 
solidarity swept 99 of the senate seats and 161 places in the 
sejm in junes twostage vote 
already there is a new style at the white building on a bluff 
above the vistula river opposition deputies have electrified the 
once sleepy sejm with harsh attacks on government policy 
sejm deputy janusz onyszkiewicz who doubles as national 
spokesman for solidarity often rides his bike to parliament deputy 
adam michnik editor of the opposition daily gazeta wyborcza so far 
has declined to discard his blue jeans 
seating for the bush speech was tight because the main chamber 
was designed to accommodate only the sejm 
but the large wooden chair for the president of poland a new 
post created by the april accords was empty authorities had hoped 
to have the president elected in time for the bush visit but the 
failure of the communist party to designate a candidate delayed the 
vote by the joint sejm and senate 
poles arent quite used to the name national assembly and the 
building is still commonly referred to as the sejm a word first 
used in the middle ages 
in polish the word sejm means assembly or council founded on 
the basis of local sejms polands first national bicameral sejm was 
convened in 1493 
in contrast to much of europe which was ruled by hereditary 
royalty poland had an elected king chosen by the sejm which 
consisted of nobles the sejm was able to check the kings power 
with its right to veto proposals 
but polands democracy ended when the crowns of austria prussia 
and russia partitioned the country among themselves in 1795 
the first modern sejm convened in 1919 after poland reappeared 
on the map of europe following germanys defeat in world war i 
parliament met in a girls school until a proper home could be built 
in 1928 
the 1939 nazi and soviet invasions of poland smothered the 
countrys democratic revival the sejm was razed during the war 
like much of the capital 
democratic elections were agreed upon in principle by the allied 
powers at the end of world war ii when the soviet red army occupied 
poland 
the 1947 elections were denounced in the west as a sham but the 
results left communists firmly in control of parliament and the 
party then rewrote the laws to preclude any real political 
opposition 
the national assembly sworn in july 4 is the first with 
opposition representation in eastern europe since the late 1940s 
under the agreement negotiaed by the communist government and the 
opposition the sejm initiates legislation and the senate holds veto 
power 
the sejm can override a senate veto only with a twothirds 
majority a margin the communist coalition lacks therefore all 
legislation will require approval of solidaritybacked lawmakers

winnie mandela met today with her 
husband jailed black nationalist leader nelson mandela who has not 
been heard from since his meeting last week with president pw 
botha 
after a onehour visit mrs mandela declined to answer 
questions saying she first would talk to antiapartheid leaders in 
johannesburg 
im afraid we have instructions from the black community 
leaders to go and report back to them before we are able to answer 
questions she told reporters at the gates of victer verster 
prison in paarl outside cape town 
mrs mandela said she planned to meet with the rev frank 
chikane a family friend but gave no indication of when a statement 
would be released 
chikane on sunday described the bothamandela meeting as an act 
of political mischief intended to sow confusion in the minds 
of black people and the outside world 
but other antiapartheid activists and commentators on various 
sides of the countrys racial issues praised the event 
the independent cape times newspaper said the encounter had 
huge symbolic significance foreshadowing mr mandelas release 
and ultimately serious negotiation to resolve the south african 
crisis 
the whiteled governments announcement saturday that botha and 
the leader of the outlawed african national congress had met took 
the mandela family and the antiapartheid movement by surprise 
the feeling is that it is of vital importance that mrs mandela 
meets mandela personally so she does not hear first from the press 
what is happening said chikane secretarygeneral of the south 
african council of churches 
he said mrs mandela flew from johannesburg to cape town to visit 
her husband at a prison farm at paarl 
chikane said mrs mandela already had planned to see her husband 
and that this was a normal visit her last visit was three weeks 
ago 
mandela 70 was transferred in december from pollsmoor prison at 
cape town to victor verster prison farm where the conditions of his 
imprisonment were eased and he was allowed to stay alone in a prison 
warders house 
he was jailed in 1962 and two years later began a life sentence 
on conviction of plotting to overthrow the government 
botha who is to step down after elections in september and 
other members of his dominant national party have hinted in recent 
months that they would like to find an acceptable formula to release 
mandela 
botha has suggested that the government could modify its demand 
that mandela make an outright renunciation of violence before his 
release 
mandela retains wide popularity among blacks the exiled african 
national congress guerrilla movement as well as antiapartheid 
black groups within south africa have said mandelas freedom is a 
condition for negotiations with the government 
botha and mandela met for 45 minutes on wednesday at bothas 
official residence in cape town the first known meeting between the 
two increased speculation that botha may free mandela before leaving 
office 
justice minister kobie coetsee attended the meeting and said 
later the two men confirmed their support for peaceful development 
in south africa 
but chikane at a sunday news conference at mrs mandelas home 
said the bothamandela meeting took place in the context of a 
prisoner and his captors 
for mrs mandela or any of our leaders to be able to contribute 
meaningfully to the search for peace in this country they must 
first be given the opportunity to be in contact with the masses they 
represent chikane said 
mrs mandela let chikane speak for her during the sunday news 
conference answering only one question about whether she thought 
the meeting meant mandela would be freed soon 
we havent the slightest idea it is impossible to analyze the 
present indications she said 
leaders of major antiapartheid groups ostracized mrs mandela in 
february because of what they called a reign of terror by her 
bodyguards in soweto the black township outside johannesburg since 
then she has made few appearances 
other antiapartheid activists welcomed the meeting anglican 
archbishop desmond tutu said botha was heeding the calls of those 
who are interested in negotiations foreign minister rf botha 
no relation to the president said the meeting would benefit all 
south africans 
under apartheid south africas 28 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

excluded from the courtroom on grounds he might be a witness at the 
hearing following the guilty plea on the degree of murder 
liability but he was allowed to stay

courtroom nodding her head when the judge asked her if she 
understood the crimes to which she was pleading guilty 
she acknowledged during questioning by the judge that she was 
pleading guilty of her own free will

satisfied that she is legally competent to make the decision but it 
is against my advice i think her decision is a result of her mental 
illness

president bush today proposed a 100 
million aid package and promised to seek new loans and debt relief 
for poland declaring that the communist nations moves toward 
democratic freedoms show the way toward a new era throughout 
europe 
in the first address by an american president before the polish 
parliament bush hailed recent political and economic reforms and 
said this generations calling is to redeem the promise of a free 
polish republic poland has not been lost so long as the polish 
spirit lives 
the polish deputies interrupted bushs speech five times with 
polite applause but gave him a standing ovation at the end 
the speech was the dramatic high point of the first day of the 
presidents 10day european tour which included 2 hours and 40 
minutes of talks with polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
bush was cheered by about 4000 flagwaving chanting poles who 
shouted long live long live when he attended wreathlaying 
ceremonies at memorials to polish war dead and the jewish victims of 
the nazi holocaust during world war ii 
at a luncheon the president urged polish communist leaders and 
representatives of the oncebanned solidarity trade union movement 
to rise above the mistrust to bring the polish people together for 
a common purpose 
in view of polands 39 billion foreign debt and other economic 
woes bushs aid proposals seemed modest 
but secretary of state james a baker iii said afterwards no 
one that weve met with so far has intimated that they expected the 
president of the united states to show up here with a big 
wheelbarrow full of dollars 
baker also brushed off suggestions that bush was attracting 
relatively small crowds numbering only in the low thousands its 
not some election campaign said baker were pleased by 
what we see as a rather spontaneous outpouring of support 
bush in his parliamentary speech said the reform of the 
polish economy will be an historic challenge there can be no 
substitute for polands own efforts 
warning that poland must accept austerity measures the president 
said i must speak honestly economic reform and recovery cannot 
occur without sacrifices 
taking the rostrum before bush spoke jaruzelski said poland is 
embarked on one grand collective experiment that will require 
internal sacrifices 
we are fully aware that the biggest work is up to us 
ourselves the communist party chief said but we do not wish to 
be alone we have many friends i am certain that polishamerican 
relations that our cooperation shall also serve as confirmation of 
that 
the sixpoint aid package announced by bush included these 
provisions 
a request to congress for a 100 million enterprise fund to 
support private entrepreneurs in poland bush said he will ask other 
industrial democracies at the economic summit in paris this weekend 
to establish similar funds 
a proposal for the seven summit nations to intensify their 
cooperation in promoting democratic reforms in poland and hungary 
he offered to work with the other summit nations to boost western 
aid and technical assistance 
a promise to establish a us center in warsaw to conduct 
educational and cultural programs he said he would ask poland to 
establish a similar center in america 
a plea for the world bank to move ahead with 325 million in 
loans to help polish agriculture and industry improve productivity 
a request for western debtor nations to support an early and 
generous rescheduling of polish debt bush said such a step could 
amount to deferral of about 5 billion in payments this year if 
western nations agreed to liberalized terms 
a request to congress for 15 million for a cooperative effort 
with poland to fight air and water pollution threatening the 
historic city of krakow 
the road ahead is a long one but it is the only road which 
leads to prosperity and social peace bush said polands 
progress along this road will show the way toward a new era 
throughout europe an era based on common values and not just 
geographic proximity 
he pledged that western democracies will stand with the polish 
people and other peoples of this region 
running throughout bushs speech was a theme of encouragement for 
the dramatic political transformations taking place in poland 
pointing to polands difficult history bush said 
you have been a crucible of conflict you are now becoming a 
vessel for change 
poland is where the cold war began and now the people of poland 
can help bring the division of europe to an end the time has come 
to move beyond containment to a world too long deferred a better 
world 
bush held out hope that changes under way in poland and hungary 
would spread beyond their borders to the rest of eastern europe 
by creating political structures legitimized by popular will 
your reforms can be the foundations of stability security and 
prosperity not just here but in all of europe now and into the 
next century he said 
bush quoted soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as saying it is 
the sovereign right of nations to choose either capitalism or 
socialism 
bush added in principle i agree but i might have said that 
the people of a nation may freely choose either a freemarket 
economy or socialism that is their right 
he emphasized that the goal of the west was not to disrupt not 
to interfere not to threaten any nations security but to help 
forge closer and enduring ties between poland and the rest of 
europe 
he also praised solidarity leader lech walesa and the roman 
catholic church which has played a key role in pressing for reform 
the extent of polands democratic reforms were underscored by the 
fact that the country boasts the only parliament in the communist 
world with a freely elected opposition party 
earlier in the day bush told luncheon guests that the united 
states will stand with poland we will support polands hopeful 
mission unparalleled in your history 
the bush talks with jaruzelski dealt with the us aid package 
and the political changes sweeping poland 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said jaruzelski 
talked at length about the political situation in poland he said 
bush reiterated the united states desire to be helpful in 
polands reform efforts without being intrusive 
fitzwater said the president thought the meeting was quite 
productive and friendly 
from their formal talks bush and jaruzelski went to a luncheon 
with about 80 other guests including government and solidarity 
leaders at the residence of us ambassador john davis jaruzelski 
told the president he appreciated the opportunity to better come 
to know each other and understand each other 
as bush and jaruzelski began their discussions secretary of 
state james a baker iii and polish foreign minister tadeusz 
olechowski signed agreements providing further delays in payments on 
about 1 billion in debts owed to the united states the accords 
granting a fiveyear grace period extended agreements reached in 
1985 and 1986 
the official news agency pap quotes olechowski as saying after 
the bushjaruzelski meeting we are not counting on a rain of gold 
but on more favorable conditions of agreements with the 
international monetary fund the world bank and also on help in 
restructuring our debt with the paris club 
bush told reporters his morning visit to the two monuments had a 
very profound effect on him before he left the jewish memorial 
the president crossed the street and shook hands with spectators 
good luck to all of you he told them 
about 2000 people including poles and american tourists turned 
out to greet bush at a wreathlaying ceremony at the tomb of the 
unknown soldier 
poles shouted long live long live and 100 years 100 
years as bush stepped out of his armored limousine 
bushs visit to poland is the first stop on a 10day trip that 
will include a meeting with solidarity leader lech walesa in gdansk 
and the firstever visit by an american president to hungary

president bush faced today what be the 
biggest hurdle on his trip to poland trying to get through those 
multisyllabic polish names without stumbling 
he didnt quite make it but he made a good try 
at the beginning of his speech to parliament bush paid greetings 
to polish leader wojciech jaruzelski sejm speaker mikolaj 
kozakiewicz senate speaker andrzej stelmachowski and prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski 
he did a passable job on jaruzelski and kozakiewicz but the 
others were a muddle 
what should have been pronounced stelmahovski came out 
stalmachowski and rakoffski came out rakowski 
if he felt selfconscious about the task bush could take comfort 
from the fact that poles have trouble saying his name too 
it usually comes out boosh 
jaruzelski by the way is pronounced yahruhzelski and 
kozakiewicz is kozakiehvich

mowry baden spent more than a year creating 
wild celery for stephen davis an abstract steel sculpture 
nestled among wildflowers and eucalyptus trees at the university of 
california at irvine 
eight years later the sculpture was razed a casualty of 
university expansion 
i was devastated said the canadian artist who had dedicated 
the maze of 60foot steel ramps to a friend and colleague its 
like having your arm cut off 
in most states baden would have received little more than 
sympathy since the school had paid him for the work but baden filed 
suit under a 1980 california law the first of its kind in the 
united states that gives artists the right to protect their works 
from destruction and alteration after the sale 
this year congress may be ready to follow the lead of california 
and eight other states and establish similar protections for artists 
nationwide opposition from auction houses movie studios and others 
largely has been removed through a series of legislative compromises 
the concept that artists retain rights even after their works are 
sold that art works remain the intellectual property of their 
creators is derived from french law the american tradition of 
treating art as pure property no different from an automobile 
or a pair of shoes was inherited from british law said mark 
fischer a boston attorney who has brought cases under 
massachusetts artist protection statute 
if you bought a painting under the french tradition you 
couldnt destroy it because you carry part of the artists 
personality with it fischer said under the english law you 
could buy a renoir and paint it red 
a 1986 scheme by an australian mail order firm in which picassos 
linocut trois femmes was sliced into oneinch squares and sold 
for 135 each is the best known but by no means only case of 
deliberate art destruction 
lesserknown cases are vilified with equal fury by the art world 
a painting covered with profanities and sliced up by the artists 
exgirlfriend a set of sculptures carved with crosses by owners who 
thought the works were possessed with evil badens wild celery 
which construction crews mistook for scrap metal 
sen edward m kennedy dmass and rep edward j markey 
dmass have taken the debate over artists rights to capitol hill 
a work of art is not a utilitarian object like a toaster it 
is a creative work like a song a poem or a novel said markey 
we should not pretend that all connection between the artist and 
the creation is severed the first time the work is sold 
this years version of the visual artists rights act is narrower 
and less controversial than unsuccessful attempts of past years 
under the measure artists would be given the right to bring a 
civil copyright suit against art owners for the distortion 
mutilation or other modification of paintings drawings 
sculptures and limited edition prints and photographs 
the proposed law pointedly excludes films and books somewhat 
easing anxiety in the motion picture and book publishing industries 
both groups have said they will not oppose the revised 
legislation although they remain apprehensive over whether the bill 
will be seen as a prelude to federal bans on the colorization of 
blackandwhite film classics and on other commercial activities 
the revised legislation also eliminates part of the original bill 
that would have allowed artists to collect a 7 percent royalty on 
highprofit works that are resold from one collector to another 
advocates argued that it was unfair for the creators of 
sculptures and paintings to sell their works for tiny sums only to 
have them resold years later at much higher prices 
but r frederick woolworth president of the art dealers 
association of america said the provision would benefit only the 
few wellknown artists who have established a secondary market for 
their works and could discourage art sales 
in a compromise that won the support of the art dealers the 
revised bill calls for the national endowment for the arts to study 
the issue and report back to congress 
kennedy held a senate hearing on the bill last month and a house 
field hearing in new york city is scheduled for next week 
the importance of government protection of art goes beyond the 
artists agony over losing a creation the bills supporters say 
there are financial ramifications as well 
the continued physical existence especially of a publicly 
displayed work greatly enhances the artists reputation and 
provides a living portfolio of the artists work for all to see 
said peter h karlen a california attorney who specializes in art 
cases 
baden sees another attribute in the type of law that led to his 
15000 settlement with the university of california the healing of 
wounds 
its like they say dont get mad get even if youre 
insulted like that and you dont act thats what leads to 
protracted anger which is debilitating

a resurgence of apathy risks reducing the 
percentage of minorities on the staffs of the countrys newspapers 
the president of the american society for newspaper editors said 
today 
employment freezes layoffs and lasthired firstfired 
policies threaten to undermine years of minority recruiting said 
loren ghiglione who is editor of a small new england newspaper 
talk of racial diversity has given way to talk of marketing 
competition and circulation editors that have established 
internship programs for minority students ask whether given the 
tone of recent us supreme court decisions they face 
reversediscrimination suits he said 
to counter indifference to the asnes goal of making newsroom 
staffs equivalent to the racial diversity of the general population 
by the year 2000 ghiglione said he has set out on a threeweek 
crosscountry trip he will meet with about 100 newspaper editors 
and publishers to try to persuade them to step up minority 
recruitment 
he told a news conference that indifference rather than 
hostility has been the chief problem he said he found only one 
daily among the seven published in maine employed any blacks 
hispanics asianamericans or native americans on their staffs 
despite a sharp increase in maines native american population 
i dont think its an exaggeration to say that the industry 
faces a crisis ghiglione said several factors a soso 
economy recent supreme court decisions on affirmative action 
programs a resurgence of apathy on the part of the press and 
politicians suggest that further progress will not come easily 
indeed it may not come at all unless each one of us in the 
newspaper industry puts more effort into overcoming indffence and 
desegregating an industry where 54 percent of the newsrooms still 
are all white 
on his own paper the news of southbridge mass ghiglione said 
the newsroom staff of 10 includes three minorities he said that 
puts the lie to the excuse offered by many editors especially on 
small papers that they cannot find qualified minorities 
they cant tell me a tiny newspaper cant recruit he said 
citing his papers use of job fairs and contacts with black 
colleges im telling them they can 
in april an asne survey reflecting responses from 64 percent of 
the nations dailies found minority staffers account for 754 
percent of the nations newsroom workforce of 56200 an increase 
from 702 percent a year earlier but 54 percent of surveyed papers 
reported they did not have one minority staffer 
if every paper in the country added one minority person to its 
staff ghiglione said the rate of increase would jump fivefold 
overnight you need to educate newspapers that havent even 
thought about the problem he said

the b2 stealth bomber conducted its 
first fullpower engine tests today emerging from its supersecret 
research hangar and rolling out onto a desert runway for the first 
time under its own power 
the sleek batlike bomber the most advanced in the pentagons 
arsenal and capable of penetrating enemy radar defenses without 
being detected taxied onto the runway shortly after sunrise and 
began a series of engine tests at various power settings 
as the tests began the engines changed in pitch from an eerie 
whistle to a low roar the aircraft then moved from a station near 
its secure hangar at a stately pace of about 10 mph for about two 
miles down the runway at air force plant 42 
i love it said air force spokeswoman capt tess taft who 
waved a small american flag 
for about two hours the sinisterlooking bomber was put through 
its engine tests then moved to the far end of the runway adjacent 
to sierra highway where it was visible to passing traffic and gave 
the public its first unobstructed view of the menacing flying wing 
since it was first displayed on nov 22 1988 
youve got a lot of firsts here today you have the first time 
under its own power you have it turning all this has only been 
done before on computer simulations said maj pat mullaney 
so its real its not a hoax said air force spokesman don 
haley its good to see something happening 
at 445 am the engines on the prototype of the bomber which 
is expected to cost the air force about 500 million each began 
warming up at 625 am the black boomerangshaped aircraft 
which is designed to drop nuclear bombs and cruise missiles rolled 
ponderously onto the tarmac 
as dawn broke at the mojave desert research and development 
facility about 50 miles north of downtown los angeles a breeze 
whipped across the runway 
the breeze might have made it difficult to acquire the data 
needed for the lowspeed test an air force spokeswoman said but by 
the time the b2 rolled onto the pad it appeared that winds had 
died down 
after the lowspeed taxi tests the plane will make highspeed 
taxi tests and then make its maiden flight sometime within the next 
two weeks said taft 
this mornings test was the first time that the radarevading 
bomber had been shown to the public since its unveiling on nov 22 
to a small group of reporters aerospace industry representatives 
and pentagon officials 
congressional critics have complained that the plane is too 
clostly with an estimated cost of 70 billion dollars for 132 
aircraft 
but secretary of defense dick cheney has defended the nations 
newest and most sophisticated bomber saying that the sleek 
allwing bomber is an important technological breakthrough using 
composite fuselage materials to absorb enemy radar waves 
the lowpitched whistle of the modified general electric engines 
transformed to a dull throaty roar once the airplane was out on the 
taxiway 
sitting near a pair of b1 bombers the aircraft in profile 
appeared less than half as long in fact the fuselage length of the 
b2 is only about as long as an f16 fighter plane 
the bomber is designed to avoid a variety of detection methods 
it generally would be quieter than other strategic aircraft and 
because of its shape and the cowling that masks its engines it would 
be able to avoid infrared detection in addition to radar

former us attorney general edwin meese iii took 
the stand today as a witness for his longtime friend and former 
lawyer e robert wallach who is charged with racketeering in the 
wedtech scandal 
in testimony in us district court in manhattan meese said 
wallach 55 told him in 1981 when meese was a highranking 
advisor to president reagan that he was very impressed by the 
wedtech corp because it employed minorities in the slums of the 
south bronx 
he said that wallach had suggested it would be a good company for 
the administration to spotlight in its proposals for urban 
enterprise zones 
wedtech once a small south bronx machine shop grew into a 100 
million government contractor through a special small business 
administration program that set aside contracts without competitive 
bidding for minoritycontrolled companies 
but evidence at earlier trials has shown that wedtech continued 
to receive the nobid contracts through a series of bribe schemes 
even after its ceased to be a minorityowned company the company is 
defunct 
meese said wallach never asked him to give preferential treatment 
to wedtech he said his discussions with wallach while he worked at 
the white house covered a wide range of issues of which wedtech was 
only a small part 
he said he met wallach in law school at the university of 
california at berkeley he said they and their families had been 
close ever since 
wallach and two other men are charged in a 22count racketeering 
indictment with extracting almost 2 million in illegal payoffs and 
payments from wedtech including some 525000 in alleged bribes to 
wallach to influence meese and other government officials 
wedtechs former chairman fred neuberger testified at an 
earlier trial that wedtech paid wallach 300000 while he was 
serving as meeses personal attorney during meeses confirmation 
hearings for the attorney general post there was no evidence 
presented that meese knew about the payments 
meese has never been charged with any crimes in connection with 
the wedtech case

economic problems and moral decay are boosting the 
soviet crime rate by nearly 40 percent and police lack the 
resources to fight back the nations top law enforcer told 
legislators monday 
interior minister vadim v bakatin appealed to the supreme soviet 
to give his department which runs the national police more money 
to stop crime that has risen under president mikhail s gorbachev 
the 542member supreme soviet questioned bakatin for an hour 
then voted to retain the 51yearold career communist party official 
as interior minister bakatin who has held his post since october 
was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 other officials 
appearing before the supreme soviet 
the reconstituted legislature strengthened by gorbachevs 
political reforms has rejected several candidates to the cabinet 
and supreme court 
bakatin told lawmakers that serious crime rose 399 percent in 
the first half of this year compared with the same period in 1988 
adolescent crime rose 11 percent last year and 22 percent so far 
this year he said unreported crime is growing at three or four 
times the rate of recorded crime he said but did not explain the 
source of that figure 
unbalanced development in the economy politics social and 
moral spheres is inevitable in the transition period through which 
soviet society is going which in turn provokes tension shortages 
social injustice and thus stimulates crime bakatin said 
many soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because of 
an increase in murders muggings and rape conservatives blame what 
they consider a lax attitude toward youth and say that cooperatives 
private businesses have become targets because of their wealth 
bakatin said government is not spending enough to fight crime 
police salaries are too low and there are shortages of cars radios 
and other equipment the minister said 
in the united states bakatin said 100 is spent per capita on 
police whereas in the soviet union the figure is 12 
gorbachev presiding at the session interrupted bakatin to say 
he had been impressed by the number of police he saw during a visit 
to west germany june 1216 
i was in the frg federal republic of germany and was talking 
and then i looked around and there were police police police 
where did they come from armed and with equipment he said 
gorbachev said he was told there is one policeman for every 400 
germans in the soviet union bakatin reported there are 17 police 
for every 10000 people or one for every 588 people 
the soviet union once kept crime statistics secret claiming 
socialism was free of the crime rampant in the west bakatin said 
such a policy was foolish 
a theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here was 
considered officially a rudiment of social antagonism from 
exploiting societies which should die as socialism developed 
bakatin said but it didnt 
blunt talk also came from another government candidate up for 
legislative approval health minister yevgeny i chazov he told 
legislators the health system is in the most severe crisis and 
said 
about 63 percent of the nations hospitals and 59 percent of 
clinics are in substandard buildings 
about 24 percent of the hospitals have no sewage facilities 
and 15 percent lack running water 
the soviet union spends less money than any developed country 
on health care 32 percent of the soviet gross national product 
versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the united states 
chazov formerly the personal physician to kremlin leaders 
including leonid i brezhnev was confirmed as health minister 
parliament turned down one nominee mikhail i busygin 58 for 
the post of forest industries deputies said that busygin who had 
held the post since 1982 had paid too little attention to 
ecological problems 
busygin also has been a nonvoting member of the communist party 
central committee since march 1986 and it was not clear how the 
parliamentary vote would affect his party post on april 25 
gorbachev purged the committee of socalled dead souls who had 
lost their main jobs but remained in the central committee

new york gov mario cuomo 
reopening a door that he had closed last year said today that as a 
public servant he is obliged to be open to the possibility of 
running for president 
of course you have to be open said cuomo in an appearance 
before the new york state broadcasters association 
nonetheless the new york democrat said all such talk about his 
political future was speculative cuomo was widely expected to run 
for president in 1988 but ultimately decided against it 
cuomo has said that he expects to run for reelection as governor 
next year in his speech today he reiterated that he doesnt 
believe a person can run for president while serving as governor 
cuomo also said as he did in 1987 that the democratic party 
would be able to find excellent candidates for the presidency in 
1992 without turning to him 
ill think about it but i wont think too much he said 
jokingly 
the governor recalling speculation that swirled around his 
possible presidential ambition for the 1988 democratic nomination 
said at some point you have to end it but he added that 
wont happen this morning

roy cohn who as an aide to sen joseph mccarthy 
in the 1950s made his reputation as an anticommunist crusader was 
himself investigated by the fbi for communist links a newspaper 
reported monday 
new york newsday said it had obtained files under the freedom of 
information act that showed that an anonymous correspondent in 1950 
wrote to the fbi alleging that cohn was an active supporter of a 
leftist congressman and affiliated with several commie outfits 
a federal loyalty review board exonerated cohn a year later after 
an fbi investigation failed to uncover any such evidence newsday 
said 
the investigation was contained in 2000 pages of fbi files 
covering 1948 until just before cohns death at 59 in 1986 
newsday said the files also showed that hoover and other top 
justice department officials distrusted cohn in the early 1950s and 
sought to keep information from him sometimes because cohn had a 
propensity for passing off fbi information as his own 
at the same time newsday said the files are replete with kudos 
from hoover for cohns anticommunist stance cohn and hoover 
developed a close relationship 
as early as 1954 there were allegations that cohn was homosexual 
but the files contained no evidence that the fbi investigated that 
aspect of cohns life 
cohn always denied the charges a biography after his death from 
aids included accounts of alleged sexual encounters with men 
cohn was chief counsel to mccarthy whose senate hearings helped 
create the anticommunist hysteria of the 1950s that cost many 
people their jobs and reputations

the no new taxes promise of federal and 
state politicians is a fine campaign slogan but it has put many 
cities in bad shape the national league of cities reported monday 
officials said that in the end local governments are the ones 
stuck with raising taxes and fees to pay their bills 
the ledgers of local government show the reality of what 
happens when others say no new taxes said alan beals executive 
director of the league the burden is shifted the taxes are 
shifted and the cities get clobbered 
he said local governments not only have to carry out their 
traditional responsibilities but they have to cope with a growing 
list of crisis issues or unfunded mandates from state or federal 
agencies 
the leagues report showed that half the 362 cities surveyed are 
spending more than they expect to take in in 1989 and 57 percent 
said their income is not keeping up with inflation 
when federal government pulls back state government pulls 
back the impact is on local government beals said asked to 
describe the cities financial ailment in human terms he said they 
were suffering from high stress high cholesterol level and heart 
attack 
sixtynine percent of the cities raised fees and charges for 
municipal services last year 41 percent raised property taxes 36 
percent reported imposing new fees and charges and 10 percent 
instituted new taxes the report said 
beals pointed to new drinking water regulations anticipated by 
the environmental protection agency expected to cost 3 billion for 
plants and equipment and 500 million a year to operate 
no one disputes the importance of safe drinking water when we 
have to foot the bills we are fully justified in objecting to the 
relentless federal intrusion into the municipal bond market beals 
said 
by writing clumsy regulations and meddlesome rules that mangle 
the municipal bond market our government is adding millions of 
dollars to the cost of financing these projects from our already 
strained local tax base 
douglas d peterson senior policy analyst for the league said 
that of the 362 surveyed communities only 108 report they are ahead 
of the game he cited sunnyvale calif as taking in 10 percent 
more than it is spending virginia beach va 24 percent kansas 
city dallas and minneapolis 05 percent and winstonsalem and 
raleigh nc 3 percent 
asked for examples of how other cities are managing beals cited 
los angeles cutting back police service new orleans cutting back to 
fourday workweeks and other cities cutting social services 
the bottom line is they are cutting into essential services 
beals said 
beals called drug abuse and affordable housing the top problems 
facing communities but said they have gone begging for federal money 
at the same time we see a massive 285 billion bailout of the 
scandalridden savings and loan industry sailing through congress 
without much anxiety even though it represents the largest federal 
outlay since the cost of fighting world war ii beals said 
the league survey was based on questionnaires sent to fiscal 
officers in 828 us cities including all cities over 50000 and a 
sampling of those between 10000 and 50000 the questionnaires were 
returned by 362 cities 
to cope with the toughertoget dollars this is how cities are 
responding 
increasing fees and charges 69 percent reducing growth of 
operational spending 43 percent increasing property tax rates 41 
percent imposing new fees and charges 36 percent reducing capital 
spending 36 percent contracting out services 32 percent reducing 
number of city employees 24 percent freezing hiring 19 percent 
imposing or raising impact fees 18 percent increasing other tax 
rates 13 percent implementing new taxes 10 percent reducing city 
services 7 percent shifting services to other government 6 
percent increasing sales tax rates 5 percent increasing income tax 
rates 3 percent

be prepared to explain why you are carrying 
a camera when visiting ethiopia dont travel in the soviet union 
unless youre in good health and be sure to have a visa upon 
arrival in india or youll find yourself on the next plane out 
regardless of its destination 
improper sexual relations with chinese citizens are verboten 
and if you are of criminal inclination never take illegal drugs 
into malaysia where traffickers face a mandatory death sentence 
so advises world status map a slick bimonthly publication that 
offers such travel advisories and disease warnings below its orange 
foldup map which colors war zones and other danger spots in red 
much of the information comes from the state department and the 
centers for disease control but publisher earl w may of fairfax 
says he uses more than 150 other sources including the world health 
organization the united nations world governments and news 
services 
may said in a telephone interview that the idea grew out of his 
brothers world travels may said he offered to find out about civil 
unrest and disease in various hot spots for his brother who worked 
for a company that drilled oil around the world 
he found there was a state department desk officer for each 
country theoretically i would have to make 200 calls and half 
the time they werent at the desk he said 
he decided there was a need for a publication to pull all of the 
available information together 
the first world status map published by mays wsm publishing co 
in merrifield came out in 1983 since then said may his 
subscription list has grown to more than 2000 travel agents

the president of the american society of 
newspaper editors said monday that the us press may become a 
bastion unless publishers insist on desegregating an industry 
where 54 percent of the newsrooms still are all white 
loren ghiglione who runs the southbridge mass news said he 
set out on a threeweek crosscountry trip last week to visit two 
dozen newspapers and meet about 100 editors publishers and owners 
in an effort to increase the industrys minority recruting and 
hiring 
speaking at a news conference monday he sounded pessimistic 
slight increases in recent years in employment of blacks 
hispanics asians and american indians stand to be reversed by a 
wave of indifference unless newspaper owners especially at small 
papers demand that editors recruit minority beginners ghiglione 
said 
they cant tell me a tiny newspaper cant recruit he said 
citing his own 7000circulation papers use of job fairs and 
contacts with black colleges im telling them they can 
ghiglione who is white said three of the 10 people in his 
newsrooms are members of minorities the paper he said is stronger 
because of the diversity of views they bring 
on the first leg of the trip through maine he said he found 
only one of seven daily papers had any minorities he said he has 
found no hostility to his goal but widespread indifference 
you need to educate newspapers that havent even thought about 
the problem he said 
i dont think its an exaggeration to say that the industry 
faces a crisis several factors a soso economy recent supreme 
court decisions on affirmative action programs a resurgence of 
apathy on the part of the press and politicians suggest that 
further progress will not come easily 
indeed it may not come at all unless each one of us in the 
newspaper industry puts more effort into overcoming indifference and 
desegregating an industry where 54 percent of the newsrooms still 
are all white 
in april an asne survey reflecting responses from 64 percent of 
the nations dailies found minority staffers account for 754 
percent of the nations newsroom work force of 56200 an increase 
from 702 percent a year earlier 
but 54 percent of surveyed papers reported they did not have one 
minority staffer 
ghiglione cited census projections that say minorities will 
become a majority of the us population in the next century to 
serve such an audience and market the newspaper industry has to 
become more than a 925 percent white symbol of the status quo he 
said 
he said he doesnt worry when larger papers hire the minority 
staff he has recruited and trained 
we lose all our good people he said well always be a 
graduate school

east german communist party leader erich honecker 
was released from a hospital monday after treatment for a gallstone 
the staterun news agency adn said 
the brief dispatch followed a report in a west german newspaper 
that honecker 76 was fighting for his life 
adn said he was released after being treated for a gallstone and 
began his summer vacation on schedule but the news agency gave no 
other details 
honecker was forced to return home early from a warsaw pact 
summit in romania on saturday at the time adn said he was 
suffering from an acute gallbladder ailment but made no other 
mention of honeckers condition until mondays report 
the report came shortly after karlheinz hiersmann a leader of 
the west germanys opposition social democratic party in bavaria 
said honeckers ailment was nothing serious 
hiersmann said in east berlin that his information came from 
hermann axen a member of east germanys policymaking party 
politburo 
the west german newspaper bild reported earlier today that 
doctors were fighting to save honeckers life the bild report 
which quoted no sources said honecker was in the intensive care 
unit of an east berlin hospital 
honecker who became party chief in 1971 and head of state in 
1976 appeared to be in robust health and alert during recent public 
appearances 
but bild and some other west german newspapers have reported that 
honeckers concentration appeared to be failing in recent months and 
that he had speech problems

cubas top government council led by 
president fidel castro turned down an army heros appeal and 
affirmed his death sentence by firing squad for drug trafficking 
the official cuban news agency said monday 
the 29member council of state unanimously upheld the death 
sentences against former maj gen arnaldo ochoa and three other 
officers according to the prensa latina report which was monitored 
in mexico 
the decision apparently exhausted the last appeal for ochoa who 
was convicted of helping smuggle tons of cocaine and shiploads of 
marijuana into the united states 
the council made its decision sunday night prensa latina said 
the news agency did not say when the death sentences would be 
carried out or whether castro could or would consider executive 
clemency the council of state is made up of senior government 
officials and is chaired by castro 
the military division of the supreme court already had refused to 
overturn the death sentences given ochoa and col antonio de la 
guardia maj armando padron and capt jorge martinez 
the highly publicized case has been an embarrassment to castro 
and the communist party castro spent years denying us accusations 
that cuba was being used to smuggle drugs saying the accusations 
were part of a us plot to discredit the revolution 
ochoa and three other officers were sentenced to death for their 
parts in helping smuggle colombian cocaine and jamaican marijuana 
into the united states across cuban seas and airspace 
the courtmartial prosecutor said that the men had committed 
crimes against foreign nations among them the united states 
ten other officers were convicted in the case which also 
involved smuggling of diamonds ivory and dollars and sentenced to 
terms ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison 
all 14 of the convicted men were officers of the cuban armed 
forces or held high positions in the security staff of the interior 
ministry 
a military court of honor stripped ochoa and the other 13 
defendants of all rank and decorations and gave them dishonorable 
discharges before the courtmartial began last week 
on friday the courtmartial convicted them on charges of drug 
trafficking corruption and treason 
the arrests and trial constituted the biggest scandal to rock 
cuba since castro came to power jan 1 1959 
ochoa 57 had fought alongside castro in cubas rugged mountains 
during the revolution that overthrew dictator fulgencio batista 
became a trusted aide and carried out confidential missions for 
castro 
ochoa had been named a hero of the republic the nations highest 
military honor for leading cuban military expeditions to angola and 
ethiopia and heading a military advisory team to nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government

animal rights activists monday protested plans to 
bring a scaled down version of the largest canadian rodeo to the 
citys new skydome stadium next year 
we view rodeos as a desensitizing experience that publicize the 
notion that this type of treatment is acceptable said michael 
osullivan spokesman for the local chapter of the world society for 
the protection of animals 
we dont need to import this kind of cruelty to animals he 
said 
mayor arthur eggleton was in calgary alberta over the weekend 
for the announcement that the calgary stampede would stage three 
shows at the skydome in september or october 1990 depending on the 
toronto blue jays baseball schedule 
toronto natives know about the stampede said the mayor 
wearing a white hat and blue western shirt now theyll be able to 
experience it 
the skydome the worlds first stadium with a retractable roof 
opened last month it houses the blue jays the toronto argonauts in 
the canadian football league and special events 
the stampede is a combined agricultural fair and rodeo each july 
that dates to 1886 in calgary and calls itself the greatest 
outdoor show on earth the toronto show would be the first ever 
outside the western province of alberta 
osullivan said the mayor should have held some form of public 
hearing before the plans were announced he said his organization 
will approach the city council to seek a ban on any rodeo events in 
toronto as well as campaign with the skydomes management and the 
rodeos corporate sponsor 
he said the last protest of rodeo events in toronto took place in 
the early 1980s at the canadian national exhibition the fair held 
at the end of each summer no such events have been held more 
recently 
skydome officials came to us last week and said this was 
something that was in the works said barry mackay of the toronto 
humane society we feel that the best way to prevent an accident 
to an animal is simply not do it 
he said the society considers virtually all events in a rodeo 
treat animals in an unnatural way while rodeos are a tradition in 
some parts of the country mackay said that tradition does not 
exist in toronto 
i can understand the calgary stampede in the cultural context 
of the wild west said nadine nowlan a member of the city 
council but its quite contrary to our whole history and 
tradition were not the wild west thank god 
bob church the stampedes president said a committee had been 
studying for two years whether to package a show that could travel 
to the united states and canadian cities

housing and urban development secretary jack kemp 
promised today that an investigation into abuses in hud programs 
wont be used as an excuse to gut housing subsidies for low and 
moderateincome americans 
kemp in a speech to the annual convention of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people also praised the 
role of the naacp in extending the american dream to blacks 
the naacp he said has been the central mover in a twostep 
process to win equality for minorities he said the process was half 
finished 
chapter one is a proud part of our countrys history the 
housing secretary said but he said the united states couldnt 
effectively promote its system as a model for the world until it 
finishes the next stage achieving equal economic opportunity as 
well 
kemp received three standing ovations from the audience of 3000 
the naacp convention opened sunday with a speech from its 
executive director benjamin hooks hooks said president bush has 
lifted the iron curtain separating blacks from the white house 
but recent supreme court rulings pose a critical challenge to 
minorities 
the conservative majority that now holds sway seem determined 
and yes hellbent on consigning civil rights and affirmative action 
gains to the ash heap of history hooks said 
vice president dan quayle will address the civil rights 
organization wednesday the convention ends thursday 
this supreme court is dangerous to the well being of black 
people women and other minorities hooks said sunday 
it is more dangerous to the legitimate hopes and aspirations of 
black people in this nation than any bull connor with a firehose 
than any jim clark with a billy club more dangerous than any ross 
barnett standing in the schoolhouse saying they shall not pass 
more dangerous than george wallace proclaiming segregation today 
segregation tomorrow segregation forever he said 
connor was public safety commissioner in birmingham ala and 
clark was a sheriff in alabama during the desegregation of the 1950s 
and early 1960s barnett and wallace were governors of mississippi 
and alabama respectively 
minority group leaders may need to revive the civil disobedience 
of past decades if the bush administration and congress fail to 
counter the anticivil rights sentiment fostered by the high court 
hooks said 
if congress does not act we must call upon our citizenry to 
mount such powerful demonstrations that the group gathered in china 
not long ago will look like a few compared with the millions that we 
mobilize he said 
hooks gave bush qualified praise for some of the people he 
appointed to serve in the administration and for meeting with jesse 
jackson and coretta scott king 
bush has brought civility to pennsylvania avenue he said 
there is no question that president bush had done much to raise 
the iron curtain that had separated the white house from black 
americans over the past several years 
the naacp however has not given blanket approval to the 
administration hooks said 
attorney general richard thornburgh must pull his head out of 
the sand and realize that his advice to the president on these court 
rulings was totally wrong we urge him to rethink his position that 
nothing has really changed hooks said 
bush can make a difference in civil rights legislation but must 
take a stronger public stand the naacp leader said 
the president for example should consider either revamping or 
dismantling the us civil rights commission which hooks said 
became an unmitigated disaster during the reagan era

outside judge louis bechtle of philadelphia 
the 58yearold judge stood with his lawyers for less than three 
minutes before the bench and spoke only a few words identifying 
himself giving his age and saying the plea is not guilty 
before bratton said further reading of the charges was not necessary 
bratton denied a request by justice department prosecutor ralph 
martin to prohibit aguilar from contacting potential witnesses 
defense lawyer patrick hallinan told reporters the request would 
have barred aguilar from speaking to half of his family and 
described it as part of the governments campaign to portray aguilar 
as a corrupt judge

reporters before the hearing he sat talking and laughing with 
defense lawyers and did not look at codefendants rudy tham an 
imprisoned former labor leader and abe chapman a selfstyled

by a federal grand jury last month on eight felony charges he has

favorable treatment for tham and another man ronald cloud a former 
law client of aguilars who was convicted of bank fraud of trying 
to help tham get a new trial while tham arranged a job for aguilars 
brother and of tipping chapman that his phone was being tapped 
aguilar is also accused of helping his former secretary vera 
hoff remain a fugitive in mexico where she fled after being 
convicted of tax evasion the judge is additionally charged with 
lying to the fbi and advising one of thams lawyers to lie to the 
grand jury

racketeering enterprise to obstruct justice

investigated the case assiduously and can find no substance to 
any of the allegations

thousands of khmer rouge refugees living 
on the thaicambodian border have fled heavy artillery attacks and 
entered a un controlled camp relief officials said monday 
in the past week about 10000 khmer rouge refugees have moved to 
the new site k camp on thailands eastern frontier southwest of 
bangkok to join about 3000 others who have lived there since june 
said a relief official who asked not to be identified 
officials said they believe the new arrivals have come from phum 
thmei one of many military camps under khmer rouge control along 
the thaicambodian border phum thmei has reportedly suffered heavy 
shelling from cambodia which is backed by vietnamese forces 
last week relief officials said they were encouraged by what 
appeared to be a gradual improvement in recent months in the 
relationship between khmer rouge and international humanitarian 
organizations 
diplomats relief workers and international human rights agencies 
have accused the khmer rouge of human rights abuses against the 
civilian population under their control 
some officials speculate that by allowing the refugees to move 
into unassisted areas the khmer rouge may be trying to present a 
better image in advance of an international conference on cambodia 
in paris next month 
the vietnamese government has promised to pull its troops out by 
the end of september and the conference is expected to discuss 
formation of an interim cambodian government 
the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people during its 
3year rule after 1975 they have fought a guerrilla war from bases 
along the thai frontier since being ousted by the vietnamese 
invasion of cambodia in 1978 
relief workers say that 50000 khmer rouge civilians live in 
camps supervised by the un border relief operation but the number 
living in secret military bases outside un control could be twice 
that large they said 
farther north from phum thmei the population of another khmer 
rouge refugee camp along the border at otrao has swollen to over 
10000 due to new arrivals from military camps relief officials 
said 
khmer rouge officials have permitted medical teams to vaccinate 
8000 people in two military camps near the unadministered site 8 
camp they said 
in midapril about 700 cambodians left the secretive khmer rouge 
camp of kaiche after it was heavily shelled and traveled a few miles 
to sok sann camp run by the noncommunist guerrillas of the khmer 
peoples national liberation front

the judges and jury monday began 
deliberating the fate of an exconvict accused of assassinating 
prime minister olof palme 
my name is christer pettersson and i did not kill olof palme 
the defendant said when asked for a statement at the close of his 
fiveweek trial 
pettersson 42 is charged with killing palme in 1986 as the 
fourterm prime minister was walking home from a movie with his 
wife lisbeth who was the prosecutions key witness 
presiding district judge carlanton spak rejected a defense 
request to dismiss the case for lack of evidence he said that on 
thursday he will announce the date the court will deliver its 
judgment the two judges and six jurors each have a vote and if the 
court is split evenly the presiding judge has the final say 
pettersson who has served a jail term for manslughter and has a 
history of drug abuse faces a mandatory life sentence but in 
practice the government always commutes such sentences to prison 
terms of less than 20 years with parole available 
defense lawyers say they will appeal if pettersson is found 
guilty 
in a 90minute summation arne liljeros said the prosecution 
lacks physical evidence to back testimony from mrs palme and other 
witnesses who said they saw pettersson at or near the street corner 
where palme was shot 
he said there are no motive no murder weapon no fingerprints 
and no powder burns on clothing to link his client to the shooting 
it must simply not happen that an innocent person is sentenced 
thoughts must not even touch on a miscarriage of justice he said 
liljeros suggested palme was assassinated in a political 
conspiracy and criticized the court for refusing to let him 
introduce evidence that could point to a plot 
the prosecutions case is built on a series of coincidences 
which dont happen in real life the shot at palme was a 
professional job he said 
olof palme was a public figure and controversial both in sweden 
and abroad and many people would have an interest in removing 
him liljeros said 
palme dominated swedish politics for a decade and earned his 
socialistminded country its reputation as an international mediator 
and champion of disarmament 
the prosecution relied heavily on mrs palmes identification of 
pettersson as the man she saw a few feet away after palme fell to 
the street fatally wounded she was slightly wounded 
liljeros said mrs palmes memory after three years should be 
considered unreliable and attacked her behavior 
lisbeth palme is a threat to the rule of law in this case he 
said 
mrs palme had demanded pettersson be removed from the courtroom 
while she testified he was brought at the end of her testimony for 
her identification 
summarizing his case thursday prosecutor anders helin said 
pettersson is the only man mrs palme has identified from 
photographs of 647 possible suspects and two police lineups 
the prosecution maintains petersson is hostile to authority and 
offers this as a motive

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
monday that he will send an emissary to the middle east to test 
israels commitment to holding elections among palestinian arabs on 
the west bank and in gaza 
baker who is traveling with president bush said at a news 
conference that the adoption of a hardline stance by prime minister 
yitzhak shamir at a likud party convention last week raised 
questions about the government position 
the emissary baker said will determine the extent to which 
the israeli government is still committed to their elections 
proposals in the aftermath of the likud party convention 
in jerusalem on monday labor party leaders recommended that 
their party quit the governing coalition to protest the likud blocs 
tougher conditions for peace talks 
the move could bring down the government and eight months after 
the last national elections force a new vote 
baker said four points approved by shamir give rise at least 
in our minds to questions about the seriousness of purpose 
the likud leadership opposes establishment of a palestinian state 
and yielding territory on the west bank or in gaza as well as 
barring palestinians in east jerusalem from voting and requiring an 
end to violence in the territories before balloting could begin 
shamirs plan would provide local selfrule to palestinians for 
five years after which israel egypt jordan and the palestinians 
would negotiate a settlement 
none of the points marked a change in shamirs position but 
their reaffirmation while the administration is failing to persuade 
the arabs to agree to elections is considered a setback to us 
diplomacy 
baker doesnt support a mideast peace conference a proposal that 
has widespread arab and west european support 
the time is not right now he said 
shamir is opposed to such a conference because it might give the 
soviets a prominent role in support of arab positions 
a senior us official traveling with baker said no parallel 
talks were planned with the palestine liberation organization plo 
support for elections is considered essential but it has denounced 
them as a ploy to prevent a palestinian state 
baker didnt say whom he would send to israel next week but 
added that reports that it would be deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger could be mistaken

undersecretary of commerce michael r darby 
said monday successful inflationfighting efforts are steering the 
economy to a socalled softlanding slower but continued 
growth but no recession 
the economic expansion is proceeding at a sustainable pace with 
favorable prospects for continued growth ahead he said in a 
speech prepared for the annual meeting of the international 
insurance society in chicago copies were made available here 
at the same time darby said we are about to experience a 
diminution of inflationary pressures brought about by past 
restrictive measures of the federal reserve 
until recently the fed had tightened its grip on credit to slow 
the economy and thus stem inflation it began easing its grip last 
month and permitted a key interest rate to decline slightly again 
last week 
in response shortterm interest rates in the bond market have 
been falling steadily and on monday chase manhattan bank lowered 
its prime lending rate by a half percentage point to 105 percent 
the second such reduction in as many months other commrcial banks 
were expected to follow suit 
darby noted concerns that inflation may be accelerating again 
because of consumer and producer price increases so far this year 
but said those concerns are misplaced 
the recent price increases are temporary effects of 
droughtrelated food price rises and of increases in oil prices 
which do not seem to be continuing he said 
darby also noted the economy now is in its seventh year of 
growth the longest peacetime expansion in our history which he 
said makes pessimists worry saying we are due for a recession 
but economic history teaches us that expansions have not died 
of old age but were killed by policies usually monetary policies 
which with the benefit of hindsight were unfortunate mistakes 
he contended 
darby pointed out current policies he said will foster continued 
economic improvement 
at present the economy is experiencing moderate growth with 
the major stimulus coming from business fixed investment and 
exports he said the consumer is spending cautiously saving a 
bit more of aftertax income than in recent years 
housing has weakened but recent reductions in mortgage 
interest rates may offer some relief in months ahead he 
continued defense industries are in a period of retrenchment 
after a lengthy buildup inventory investment generally has been 
conservative though the auto industry currently has problems with 
too many unsold cars 
given these crosscurrents in economic activity and the 
favorable inflation outlook prospects are good for growth in the 
nonfarm economy in the 2 to 3 percent range over the four quarters 
of 1989 what is being called a softlanding

israeli troops and allied militiamen 
backed by helicopter gunships killed three guerrillas monday in 
south lebanon police said 
the thrust by 70 israeli soldiers and militiamen of the south 
lebanon army followed an attack by three palestinian and leftist 
lebanese factions on israels selfdesignated security zone 
along the border police said 
an israeli army spokesman said the militiamen killed the three 
guerrillas and that israeli forces in a separate operation detained 
a number of suspects 
guerrillas armed with automatic weapons targeted a joint patrol 
of israelis and the mainly christian militiamen on the zones 
northern edge said a police spokesman who cannot be identified in 
line with standing regulations 
two hours later 13 armored personnel carriers rolled out of the 
buffer zone to counterattack suspected guerrilla hideouts around the 
villages of zillaya and dellaya in the foothills of mount hermon 
the spokesman said 
the south lebanon army gave the bodies of the three guerrillas to 
the international red cross just before the incursion force withdrew 
into the zone at midday without suffering any casualties the 
spokesman said 
he said israeli helicopter gunships strafed zillaya and dellaya 
in repeated runs for an hour after the withdrawal 
in jerusalem an army spokesman indicated there were two separate 
operations by israeli troops and the 2500strong south lebanon army 
he said the militia killed three guerrillas armed with rocket 
propelled grenades bombs and personal weapons in the hasbaya area 
in what appeared to be the clash that followed the palestinian 
assault 
he denied israeli troops were involved in this operation in the 
eastern sector of the security zone a six to 10mile area just 
north of the border that israel carved out in 1985 as a buffer 
against guerrilla forays 
the spokesman said a combined israeli force of infantry 
artillery and tanks launched a preventive attack north of the 
zone against guerrilla bases of the iranianbacked hezbollah or 
party of god near the villages of klea and zillaya in the morning 
he said the area has been used by hezbollah to prepare and launch 
attacks on the security zone 
the raiding force he said detained an undetermined number of 
suspects he reported no casualties from that raid 
before the pullback the israeli force distributed leaflets 
warning the population against collaboration with guerrillas 
in beirut the fatahrevolutionary council faction headed by 
palestinian terrorist abu nidal said two of its guerrillas were

chinas communist party sought to restore its 
tainted image monday by publicizing a nationwide crackdown on 
corruption in its ranks one of the demands of the student movement 
crushed by the government 
new party general secretary jiang zemin also met two foreign 
delegations from romania and ethiopia in a show of diplomacy as 
usual despite icy relations with western governments protesting 
chinas bloody suppression of unarmed demonstrators 
every major daily newspaper carried lengthy articles monday on 
the expulsion and other punishment of party members caught 
embezzling profiteering and abusing their power 
an end to official corruption was one of the calls of studentled 
demonstrators they also demanded freedom of the press and a 
dialogue with government officials 
the peoples daily official mouthpiece of the 477 
millionmember party that is the worlds biggest political 
organization said 452 officials in the southern province of guizhou 
were expelled for corruption in the first half of 1989 
on sunday it was reported that a local party leader in guizhou 
was sentenced to death for selling bootleg liquor 
the government which ordered troops into beijing on june 34 to 
crush the student movement now has seized the corruption issue as 
its own 
the recent turmoil and rebellion included many people because 
some party members cadres and especially a minority of leaders were 
engaged in corrupt practices which made the people very 
dissatisfied the peoples daily said 
organizers of the rebellion used anticorruption slogans to 
incite the uncertain public it said 
among other cases reported monday the vice chairman of the 
commodity prices committee in western gansu province was expelled 
from the party for making 170000 by profiteering in sugar 
another gansu official was punished for using public funds to buy 
a private home and a third sold statesupplied medicine and used the 
money to hold an elaborate funeral for his wife 
the workers daily said a 32yearold worker in central chinas 
shanxi province will be executed for embezzling 219000 in public 
funds 
guangming daily said party members in inner mongolia must admit 
voluntarily to all corrupt activities and that 450 people have been 
arrested since a corruption reporting center opened in shanghai a 
year ago 
state tv gave prominent coverage to new party boss jiang zemin 
meeting monday with delegations communist parties from romania and 
ethiopia 
xinhua news agency said jiang thanked the romanian party for its 
understanding and support at a time when china is confronted with 
temporary difficulties 
jiang former party chief in shanghai was named party chief last 
month after zhao ziyang was purged of party posts for opposing the 
use of force 
xinhua also quoted peng chong vice chairman of chinas 
legislature as expressing sincere thanks to the ambassador of 
north korea for supporting chinas handling of the 
counterrevolutionary conspiracy 
almost all highlevel diplomatic contacts between china and the 
west have been frozen because of the military attack on protesters 
and arrests of more than 2000 people across the country 
china continued to attack the united states on monday with the 
beijing daily saying the united states with its discrimination 
against blacks and other minorities has no right to condemn chinas 
human rights record 
the article criticized president bush who visited beijing in 
february in the role of an old friend of china for inviting 
dissident fang lizhi to a banquet attended by senior chinese leaders 
fang who was turned away from the banquet by police took refuge 
in the us embassy following the crackdown the government has put 
him on a wanted list for counterrevolutionary crimes 
the peoples daily commentary stressed student protesters need 
greater ideological education but will not be punished while those 
who led the movement will not be forgiven 
in the west a leading chinese dissident was quoted monday as 
saying that senior leader deng xiaoping could order thousands of 
executions twentyseven people have been executed in china since 
june 4 many of them student leaders others executed were common 
criminals 
deng now will so i believe have thousands of people killed 
first the students then the intellectuals said yan jiaqi former 
director of the beijing institute of political studies in the west 
german magazine der spiegel it said its reporters spoke to yan in 
paris where he fled last month 
mondays editions of the paris newspaper le monde quoted yan as 
saying the cruelty of deng xiaoping goes way beyond that of mao 
tsetung and chiang kaishek 
the massacre of june 4 was 10 20 100 times crueler than the 
cultural revolution he said during the 196676 cultural 
revolution people were suppressed with clubs whereas today they 
use tanks and rifles to gun down the crowd yan said

president bushs 115 million aid package 
for poland intentions aside is a drop in the bucket for a nation 
crushed by 39 billion in foreign debt 
bushs visit provided a strong symbolic boost for the advocates 
of democratic reforms in a country grappling with political 
uncertainty he went out of his way to strengthen the hand of the 
solidarity trade union and to encourage changes throughout eastern 
europe 
but he did not offer much in the way of financial help 
brushing off suggestions that poles would be disappointed 
secretary of state james a baker iii said no one weve met with 
so far has intimated that they expected the president of the united 
states to show up here with a big wheelbarrow full of dollars 
bush offered a number of steps promising to seek international 
debt relief and to press for approval of 325 million in loans that 
are being considered by the world bank 
however the only proposals with a direct cost for washington 
were creation of a 100 million fund to spur development of the 
private sector and a proposal for 15 million in environmental 
cleanup for the city of krakow 
neither step will do much to curb polands rampant inflation 
running at 100 percent or ease critical shortages of food and 
consumer products 
perhaps it was the recognition that bush was not going to provide 
a magic solution for polands problems that kept down the size of 
street crowds greeting the president 
crowds of just 2000 to 3000 people turned out to see bush at 
public events in warsaw despite efforts by us officials and 
solidarity leaders to drum up interest in his visit 
american officials were sensitive to possible unfavorable 
comparisons between bushs reception here and the enthusiastic 
crowds that greeted soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in west 
germany last month 
its not some election campaign where weve gone out here and 
tried to turn out crowds insisted baker despite evidence to the 
contrary bush emphasized that poland needs more than outside help 
the us view is that poland must overhaul its economy to a 
freemarket system abandoning politically popular government 
subsidies and imposing other belttightening measures 
i must speak honestly bush told polands parliament as he 
outlined the modest us aid program economic reform and recovery 
cannot occur without sacrifices 
white house chief of staff john sununu argued that rewarding 
democratic reforms with a lot of money could be perceived by the 
soviet union and some of the countries in eastern europe as merely 
an attempt to buy the soviet union out of influence in this region 
perhaps mindful that infusions of cash in the 1970s did not 
revitalize polands economy sununu bluntly said you cant create 
the problem of a young person in the candy store where there is so 
much there that they dont know which direction to take and dont 
have the selfdiscipline to take the right steps 
if nothing else bushs visit was a shot in the arm for 
solidarity the once outlawed labor union that now sits in 
parliament as the first freely elected opposition party in the 
communist world 
he made a deliberate gesture on behalf of solidarity at a 
luncheon he gave for political leaders and others at the residence 
of us ambassador john davis 
bronislaw geremek the leader of solidarity in the parliament and 
a top adviser to lech walesa got a seat of honor next to bush at 
the head table 
some distance away at a table with bushs wife barbara sat 
polands leader communist chief gen wojciech jaruzelski who 
imposed martial law in 1981 to crush solidarity and imprison its 
leaders 
geremek told the luncheon that the future of polands reforms 
depends on poles alone we do not expect that they will be carried 
at somebody elses cost or by others hands 
he said bushs declaration of support for political reforms were 
exactly what we expected and were the words that we were 
hoping for 
maybe so but a request by solidarity for 10 billion in western 
aid still remains alive and in a meeting tuesday in the baltic sea 
city of gdansk walesa himself will personally make the request of 
bush

the government called the 
meeting between president pw botha and nelson mandela a very 
positive step but did not say whether the jailed black leader 
would be released soon a newspaper reported monday 
also on monday antiapartheid groups said mandela is seeking to 
release a statement explaining the talks held wednesday at bothas 
official residence in cape town 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader has drawn up the 
statement and submitted it to prison authorities antiapartheid 
leader rev frank chikane told reporters in johannesburg 
chikane and mandelas wife winnie refused to divulge its 
contents or say when it might be released 
the prisons service had no comment when asked about the statement 
mrs mandela met with her husband for an hour monday at the 
victor verster prison outside cape town but she refused to answer 
questions about it 
antiapartheid activists agree that it is best for us to let 
the leader mandela speak for himself said chikane general 
secretary of the south african council of churches 
but he added mr mandela remains a prisoner of the south 
african government and is therefore not free to propagate his ideas 
we do not know whether what he has to say will reach the public 
without being tampered with 
the bothamandela meeting took the antiapartheid movement by 
surprise mrs mandela said sunday she was not aware of the meeting 
until after it happened 
it is illegal to quote mandela in south africa but people who 
have met with him in recent years have conveyed his thoughts and his 
daughter zindzi read a statement released by him in 1985 
minister of information stoffel van der merwe described the 
bothamandela meeting as a very positive step 
i wouldnt go as far as saying that the way has been opened for 
his release van der merwe was quoted as saying in the star the 
countrys largest daily newspaper 
chikane accused the government of trying to use the meeting as 
a form of propaganda to give an impression that south africa is 
changing and is negotiating 
but chikane added there can be no negotiations between the 
whiterun government and the 28 million black majority until mandela 
and other political prisoners are released and the anc is legalized 
the anc said monday the meeting was a public relations 
exercise 
it would be wrong for anybody to believe that the meeting 
signified the start of negotiations between the black people of 
south africa and the national party government anc spokesman tom 
sebina said from the orgaizations headquarters in lusaka zambia 
nonetheless the meeting the first between botha and mandela 
was frontpage news in south africa and reignited speculation that 
mandela may soon be released after more than 27 years in prison 
mandela 70 was transferred in december from pollsmoor prison in 
cape town to the victor verster prison farm where the conditions of 
his imprisonment were eased and he was allowed to stay alone in a 
prison warders house he is serving a life sentence for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the government 
botha and other members of the ruling national party have hinted 
in recent months they would like to find an acceptable formula to 
release mandela 
botha has suggested the government could modify its demand that 
mandela make an outright renunciation of violence before his release 
mandela has said he will not disavow violence until apartheid is 
dismantled and the anc made legal again 
the sowetan the countrys largest blackoriented daily said the 
african national congress expected anc leader walter sisulu to be 
freed before parliamentary elections sept 6 and mandela and other 
political prisoners to be released after the elections

richard boucher appeared to rebut published reports that the bush

angolan president jose eduardo dos santos to open negotiations with 
rebel leader jonas savimbi 
boucher called dos santos decision to meet with savimbi a 
significant step toward national reconciliation but said the 
united states would not reward the government before the process is 
complete 
the united states continues to have serious reservations about 
admitting angola to the imf boucher said we have no intention 
of establishing diplomatic relations with angola before national 
reconciliation is achieved 
the angolan government had hoped that opening negotiations with 
savimbi together with the withdrawal of cuban forces would lead to 
full diplomatic relations with the united states 
the imf executive board has voted to admit angola a step the 
united states alone could not block

the senior us official for african 
affairs said monday that namibias independence plan is on track but 
that pretoria and the southwest africa peoples organization should 
ease tension in the territory 
herman cohen us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs spoke after talks with namibias south african 
administrator louis pienaar and the un representative to the 
territory martti ahtisaari 
cohen said namibias yearlong independence process has passed an 
irreversible threshold he siad he is pleased with the ongoing 
repatriation of namibian refugees and registration of voters for 
november elections 
however he warned south africa and the southwest africa 
peoples organization that they are not doing enough to reduce the 
suspicion that developed during their 23year bush war 
the guerrilla organization accuses the territorys south 
africancontrolled police force of intimidating its supporters in 
northern towns and villages where it draws most support 
we took very seriously the complaint of the un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar about the excessive use 
of force in northern namibia and the abuses by the police force 
cohen told a news conference 
he called on south african officials to work on defusing the 
rather tense situation in northern namibia 
he also noted south africa is uneasy because many guerrillas have 
remained at camps in angola rather than return to namibia as 
civilians 
i would urge swapo to repatriate former members as soon as 
possible so they can be here as civilians and voters rather than in 
angola as sequestered fighters he said 
south africa agreed to end its 74year rule of namibia under a 
regional peace agreement in exchange for the repatriation of 50000 
cuban troops in angola 
the southwest africa peoples organization is expected to win 
the elections no date for independence has been set but it is 
expected early next year more than 5000 un monitors are

the 500 million b2 stealth bomber 
revved its engines and taxied across a desert runway at up to 100 
mph monday operating under its own power for the first time 
the air force pronounced the tests of the sinisterlooking 
blackandgray flying wing a success and said highspeed tests of 
the radarevading nuclear bomber would be conducted later this week 
with a view toward its first flight soon afterward 
youve got a lot of firsts here today said maj pat 
mullaney you have the first time under its own power you have it 
turning all this has only been done before on computer 
simulations 
the sleek boomerangshaped strategic bomber rolled from its 
supersecret research hangar and taxied back and forth on an 
11000foot runway at air force plant 42 the crucible through which 
virtually all air force aircraft pass 
i love it said air force spokeswoman capt tess taft waving 
an american flag 
three taxi tests at different speeds stopped traffic on sierra 
highway next to the plant and offered the first unobstructed view of 
the craft since it was unveiled for the news media on nov 22 
at approximately 500 million each the plane is the nations 
most expensive and controversial joining the nations arsenal 
during a period of increasing pentagon budget cuts 
the stealth is designed to drop nuclear bombs and fire cruise 
missiles and evade radar and infrared detection 
despite delays that have plagued the b2 brig gen richard 
scofield b2 program director said everybody in the air force 
is convinced that we are working the schedule the right way we are 
making sure the plane works right for when we do the hazardous 
testing and flight test is hazardous 
tests on the b2 took place in the antelope valley of the mojave 
desert where the space shuttle was built and where test pilot chuck 
yeager first broke the sound barrier in 1947 
for weeks people fascinated with the eerie mantalike aircraft 
have parked nearby hoping for a glimpse on monday the dozen or so 
regulars got an eyeful 
the plane rolled out of its hangar shortly after sunrise and 
stayed in view of highway onlookers for three hours periodically 
its engines ran at various pitches and decibels sometimes blowing a 
lonesome whistle across the desert sometimes accelerating up to a 
dull roar

the solidarity signs along warsaws streets

antigovernment polish demonstrators 
shouting down with communism greeted president bush monday as he 
arrived for a formal state dinner hosted by the communist party 
chief gen wojciech jaruzelski 
the demonstrators who also chanted jaruzelski must go could 
be heard among the 1000 people outside radziwill palace when the 
bushes arrived 
it was the first protest of bushs visit to eastern europe which 
began sunday night and appeared to have been staged by splinter 
opposition groups 
the bush motorcade pulled straight into the palace driveway and 
there was no indication if he heard the chants or saw a sign 
reading poland like the united states has a right to be 
independent 
the dinner was held in a green marble ballroom on the second 
floor of the reconstructed 17th century palace used most recently 
for the roundtable reform talks between the solidarityled 
opposition and the communist government 
among the 100 guests were political leaders and members of the 
opposition including three top solidarity trade union advisers

thousands of iranians turned out for an 
antisaudi arabia rally monday the second anniversary of fatal 
riots by iranians in mecca and irans president said saudi 
government officials were terrorists 
the developments deepened a growing rift between irans shiite 
moslem government and the sunni rulers of saudi arabia as both 
countries prepared for major religious events this week 
the saudi regime which massacres in cold blood hundreds of 
pilgrims near allahs safe house is a terrorist tehrans official 
islamic republic news agency quoted president ali khamenei as saying 
saudi officials say iranian fundamentalists caused the july 10 
1987 riots in which more than 400 mostly iranian protesters died 
iran says its pilgrims were exercising their legitimate right to a 
political protest in mecca birthplace of the prophet mohammed 
in saudi arabia on monday king fahd called for heightened 
security around the annual moslem pilgrimage or hajj to the 
shrines in mecca and medina apparently fearing iranianinstigated 
trouble 
tehran television monitored in nicosia showed thousands of 
iranians converging on the imam hussein square in downtown tehran 
chanting mecca and medina should be liberated 
thursday marks the end of the 40day mourning period for 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 the planned final mass 
outpouring of grief at his grave coincides with the climax of the 
pilgrimage in saudi arabia the eid aladha or feast of sacrifice 
iran claims the pilgrimage is being corrupted and has boycotted 
it for the second straight year 
last year the saudi government also introduced a quota system 
limiting the number of pilgrims to 1000 per million of population 
effectively cutting the usual iranian contingent of 150000 to about 
50000 
fahds call for tighter security came days after a saudi 
editorial rebuked iran for introducing politics into a religious 
festival and for keeping its people away from the hajj one of the 
five duties of all moslems 
saudi arabia severed relations with tehran in april last year 
citing subversion and terrorism 
the shiitesunni rift evolved from the bloody 7th century fight 
over who would succeed mohammed founder of islam as leader of the 
religion

house speaker thomas s foley said monday that 
president bushs proposals to raise pay for judges and top 
executivebranch officials cannot win approval without a link to 
higher pay for members of congress 
foley said he prefers there to be no connection but he suggested 
his view is not widely shared on capitol hill 
there will be no disconnection between judges and the 
executive branch and congress he said the underlying reality 
of that in my judgment is that the votes do not exist to do it 
the house speaker dwash commented at a luncheon with 
executives and reporters of the associated press 
any congressional increase would have to meet a 
reasonableness test unlike the failed 51 percent pay hike 
sought early this year and would have to be supported by both the 
house and senate both democrats and republicans and by party 
political operatives as well as leaders such as bush he said 
foley said that even though the previous pay raise idea was 
supported by two republican presidents the democraticcontrolled 
congress was politically mauled by republican campaign operatives 
i dont want to get into something where the president says 
yes and the congressional campaign committee says no foley said 
thats unacceptable that sort of goodcop badcop routine 
and foley repeated past criticism of media coverage of the 
payraise issue saying the public was not well informed about the 
last raise attempt and was whipped into opposition 
if there is a similar atmosphere the next time if its a here 
they go again sort of thing beating up on the congress im not 
going to put lawmakers through that he said 
bush has so far proposed pay increases for judges and for senior 
executive branch officials he has said he will work with congress 
toward a pay raise but has not submitted a plan for boosting 
lawmakers pay 
the matter of top federal pay scales remains far down the agenda 
as congress returns this week from its fourth of july recess foley 
said much of this month will be spent in passing all or close to 
all of the 13 appropriations bills the annual money measures that 
provide the funding for most government programs 
as for other priorities for the rest of the year foley listed 
savings and loan bailout legislation a military spending bill 
budget trims to meet deficit targets child care and clean air 
measures and family leave and minimum wage bills 
on other topics foley said 
he still plans to resist any immediate attempt to amend the 
constitution to bar flag desecration preferring to try first 
putting the protective language into law it would be wise to 
start with a statute it is unwise to rush into a constitutional 
amendment especially in the heat of this issue im not going 
to change my mind about that obviously 
bush gets relatively high marks so far in his conduct of 
foreign affairs having reasserted us leadership in nato having 
struck a proper balance in the us response to chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and having increased consultation with 
congress bushs challenge now is keeping alive political and 
economic change in eastern europe without causing destabilization 
he said 
the bitter partisan mood that surrounded his predecessor jim 
wright of texas has largely been left behind with wrights 
departure the mood is to have a more conciliatory and 
mutually respecting environment he said i dont think jim 
broke the rules in his treatment of republicans but i think we 
pushed the rules to the edge of the envelope and that helped to 
break down the sense of comity in the house

selfinterest he said

a poll released monday said 
fernando collor de mello a 39yearold former state governor who 
leads a new party holds a 31 lead over his nearest rival four 
months before the presidential election 
the former governor of alagoas state in the poor northeast was 
preferred by 39 percent of those interviewed said the brazilian 
institute of public opinion and statistics 
leonel brizola former governor of rio de janeiro state was 
second with 13 percent followed by socialist labor leader luis 
inacio lula da silva with 7 percent 
brazilians are to vote nov 15 for a successor to president jose 
sarney who cannot succeed himself the term is five years 
it will be the first direct presidential election since 1960 
when janio quadros won the military seized power in 1964 and 
relinquished it in 1985 
collor de mellos small national reconstruction party was founded 
only this year he rose in the polls from 7 percent in march to 20 
percent in april and has led since 
his rating of 39 percent was slightly below the 43 percent of a 
month earlier but carlos augusto montenegr director of the polling 
institute said the change was not significant because no other 
candidates performance rose substantially 
the latest sampling was of 3753 people in 255 cities questioned 
between june 29 and july 5 the institute said and the margin of 
error was 2 percent 
brizolas rating was 13 percent up from 11 percent the former 
leftist firebrand who represents the democratic labor party and now 
projects a more moderate image is widely considered collor de 
mellos main competition 
in 1982 brizola came from a similar distance back in the polls 
to win the rio governorship 
da silvas position began to erode early this year because of 
strikes led by labor groups linked to his radical workers party 
other candidates include rep ulysses guimaraes former speaker 
of the house of represenatives from the centrist brazilian 
democratic movement party sen mario covas of the centerleft 
brazilian social democracy party and wealthy businessman paulo 
maluf the 1985 presidential candidate of the militarys democratic 
social party each got 5 percent in the polls 
responses to other questions in the survey indicated brazilians 
worry most about unemployment inflation health care and education 
in that order 
the popularity of collor de mello a businessman is considered a 
sign of dissatisfaction with sarney whom he often criticizes the 
59yearold president has been unable to curb 1000 percent annual 
inflation and allegations of corruption in his government arise 
frequently 
as governor of alagoas collor de mello caught the nations 
attention by refusing to pay state workers known as maharajahs 
who had attained high salaries through corruption the campaign 
against such employees spread to other states and has been the core 
of his presidential campaign 
opponents claim collor de mello appointed thousands of civil 
servants in his home state and was overly generous in settling a tax 
dispute with alagoas sugar barons

rife with racial tension monday after a threehour uprising left 
nine people injured and several buildings in ashes authorities said 
the uprising at the countyrun minimum and mediumsecurity 
banning rehabilitation center began late sunday when officers were 
inspecting a mostly black 55man barracks said riverside county 
sheriffs capt jake bowser 
the inmates were standing outside the building when hispanic 
inmates from a neighboring barracks started pummeling them with 
rocks and other debris said bowser 
when the corrections officers tried to intervene they were 
pummeled too he said 
tim lewis who lives across the street said he heard a large 
explosion like a sonic blast flames leaped high into the sky 
over the camp and about 15 minutes later a power pole exploded and 
plunged the camp into darkness he said 
the inmates gave up the battle when officers in riot gear 
entered no shots were fired i think when we opened the gates 
with our gear on it got their attention and they complied with our 
orders said bowser

wounds and two prison officers suffered minor injuries 
the kitchen commissary workrelease center and an operations 
building housing corrections officers lockers were burned as were 
three smaller buildings three trucks a county car and a sheriffs 
patrol car bowser said 
bowser had no estimate of damage monday but said workers were 
setting up temporary kitchens to feed inmates the camp with a 
784inmate capacity held 766 inmates including 113 women when the 
riot erupted 
there were definitely racial overtones bowser said 
inmate diane mason interviewed as she was receiving oxygen in an 
ambulance said she was talking to her boyfriend through a fence 
when she heard people yell that there was a fight in the 
minimumsecurity area 
she said people came running out of the commissary throwing 
things all of a sudden a big old fire blazed up out of nowhere 
mason said 
earlier monday helicopters using search lights illuminated the 
surrounding land as law officers looked for any escapees a head 
count revealed no inmates were missing said bowser 
about 300 inmates were sent to other jails in riverside and san 
bernardino counties bowser said those who remained were locked in 
their barracks 
they are real subdued now and im sure they arent happy but 
we had to do this to control the situation bowser said 
the jail camp is 90 miles east of los angeles

sophisticated blood testing techniques 
developed by the centers for disease control will enable scientists 
to provide better data on whether agent orange sprayed on trees in 
vietnam is having adverse health effects on veterans a panel of 
experts told a house subcommittee monday 
controversy has ranged for years over whether the government is 
responsible for a variety of health problems reported by vietnam 
veterans who assert their problems were caused by exposure to agent 
orange 
a majority of scientists maintain there is no established link 
between the kind of exposure to dioxin that occurred in vietnam and 
health hazards 
on the other hand veterans groups argue there is no other 
explanation for cancers and birth defects reported by vietnam 
veterans 
a panel appearing before the veterans affairs hospitals and 
health care subcommittee agreed that the blood test now being used 
to measure dioxin levels in the blood gives researchers a better 
tool to determine whether people who fear they suffered 
healththreatening exposure to dioxin actually did so 
dioxin is the main ingredient in agent orange and has been linked 
to various cancers and birth defects in rats although not 
conclusively in humans 
dr vernon n houk director of the center for environmental 
health and injury control at the atlantabased cdc told the 
subcommittee the test developed about three years and just now 
coming into wide use can detect dioxin in the blood of farm 
workers who have not been exposed to the chemical in 30 years and 
thus will be an accurate measure of exposure levels in vietnam 
veterans 
houk said development of the test made a whole new ball game 
for us it really let us clarify how much people were exposed 
he said the cdc is in the process of applying the test to 2000 
blood samples of vietnam veterans and will be finished by next 
march when it expects to issue a definitive report 
he said the test costs about 1000 for each sample and that his 
staff of 16 can perform about 50 a week

syrias sea blockade 
christian gen michel aoun refused to specify his plans monday 
but when asked if a naval confrontation was imminent he said 
everything is possible and we shall use the means in our 
posession 
aoun decided on the bombing runs against us advice that he 
avoid escalating hostilities and undermining arab league peacemaking 
efforts his aides said on condition of anonymity 
from the bunker of his shellravaged presidential palace aoun 
told reporters we have no aggressive intentions but the syrians 
are escalating their acts of piracy in our waters and in 
international waters 
an aoun aide said that after four months of the blockade the 
general cant take the syrian naval siege anymore hes going to 
try to break it by force using the air force 
aoun has three old britishmade hawker hunter jet fighters and 
eight frenchmade gazelle helicopter gunships in operation 
his aides say syria has six gunboats patrolling offshore as well 
as sophisticated mig23 fighterbombers syrian jets in the past 
have been shot down by israeli warplanes which patrol lebanese 
airspace and claim lebanese skies are within israels sphere of 
influence 
aouns decision was reported as gunners from the syrian army and 
aouns mainly christian lebanese army dueled with howitzers and 
rockets and street gunbattles between rival shiite moslems ebbed 
into sporadic sniping 
in south lebanon palestinian and leftist lebanese guerrillas 
attacked israeli troops patrolling with allied lebanese militiamen 
three guerrillas were killed in the shootout police said 
aouns aides said the 54yearold general decided to use the air 
force against the syrian navy last week when gunboats were deployed 
to tighten the fourmonthold blockade 
they said aoun communicated his decision to ambassadors of the 
five permanent members of the un security council britain china 
france the soviet union and the united states 
us ambassador john mccarthy however prevailed upon aoun to 
postpone the strikes according to aides 
but with syrian gunboats now intercepting various ships heading 
for the christian coast almost daily the general is brushing aside 
the american ambassadors advice the aide said 
gunboats have intercepted a fuel tanker and three cargo ships 
carrying food in the past two days and taken them to lebanons 
syriancontrolled port of tripoli aouns aides reported 
a lebanese yacht with six men aboard was seized by two syrian 
gunboats before dawn sunday after it sailed from kaslik christian 
harbor it was escorted to syrias northern tartus naval base they 
said 
police said syria attacked the malteseregistered tanker aloil 
after it unloaded its cargo of gasoline at the christian port of 
jounieh all eight crewmen were rescued 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which 
monitors maritime activity said the aloil sank it said the vessel 
is owned by alco shipping co of piraeus greece 
at least five other cargo vessels have been hit by syrian 
shellfire since the siege was imposed march 14 a turkish sailor was 
killed and an indian sailor was missing and presumed dead 
also monday a syrian gunboat intercepted the santa maria 
hovercraft that has been running the gauntlet of syrian shellfire to 
ferry besieged christians to cyprus the ferry en route from 
jounieh to larnaca was held for two hours 
syrias military command did not comment on aouns reported 
decision about 40000 syrian troops are stationed in lebanon they 
have violated a 1976 arab league mandate by siding with moslems 
against the christians who have 20000 troops 
two people were killed and five wounded in the overnight exchange 
of shellfire in beirut and north lebanon police said this raises 
the toll to 405 killed and 1581 injured since the syrianchristian 
confrontation broke out march 8 
syrian troops who police west beirut were deployed monday in 
ouzai and jnah residential districts to try to disengage warring 
militiamen of the prosyrian mainstream shiite amal and 
iranianbacked fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god

financial markets stabilized 
monday in response to new austerity measures imposed by president 
carlos menem to reduce 1 million percent annual inflation and a 
massive budget deficit 
meanwhile in his third day in office menem moved forward in 
another sensitive area the military by replacing the air force and 
army chiefs 
we had no other choice no other resource menem said in 
reference to economic measures announced sunday night that devalued 
the national currency by onehalf and increased gasoline prices by 
as much as 610 percent 
weve never found ourselves in such a difficult situation 
said menem who was inaugurated saturday 
there was no other possibility for the argentine republic he 
said 
the plan also envisions cutting back drastically on government 
spending selling many staterun industries reducing subsidies and 
tax breaks for private companies and enforcing widely ignored tax 
laws 
from what i see people are reacting well so far menem said 
on monday monthly interest rates dropped to 18 percent as 
investors put their money in banks and bonds rather than in dollars 
heavy speculation on the dollar forced interest rates to 200 percent 
a month in june 
under the austerity measures the central bank argentinas 
equivalent to the federal reserve ordered a 537 percent 
devaluation of the austral currency setting its value at 655 per 
dollar compared with 303 per dollar on friday 
the devaluation brought the austral into line with the black 
market and was intended to encourage exporters to sell foreign 
currency to the central bank which has low cash reserves 
as part of menems economic program gasoline prices went up 
6105 percent and electricity and telephone fees rose by about 200 
percent the government news agency telam said 
traffic on buenos aires streets was lighter than usual monday 
morning an indication that some commuters had abandoned their cars 
in favor of public transport 
natural gas prices will rise 640 percent for businesses and 200 
percent for homeowners economy minister miguel roig who announced 
the measures did not say when those rates would take effect 
fares for buses subways commuter trains and airplanes were 
expected to double on july 17 government spokesmen said 
the measures are aimed at reducing inflation that in june soared 
by 1145 percent an annual rate close to 1 million percent and 
narrowing a budget deficit estimated at 12 percent to 15 percent of 
the gross national product 
the former government of president raul alfonsin financed the 
deficit caused in large part by operating losses at staterun 
companies by printing money or borrowing abroad 
neither avenue is open to menem who was elected may 14 the 
nation is 45 billion in arrears in interest payments on the 60 
billion foreign debt the austral valued at 18 per 1 in february 
has lost 97 percent of its value in five months 
inflation and devaluations touched off a recession in which real 
wages have fallen by at least 35 percent this year and unemployment 
has climbed to 10 percent 
workers would be shielded somewhat from the effects of menems 
austerity measures by controls on the prices of milk bread and 
other basic commodities and a small onetime pay increase this 
month roig said the pay increase which will go to salaried 
workers and retirees amounts to 8000 australs about 12 
but there still appears to be the danger of social unrest 
labor unions denounced price hikes in the past weeks and hungry 
shantytown dwellers looted food stores again last week in rosario 
the countrys thirdlargest city 
roig said the only solution was a freemarket policy in which the 
private sector would provide services now offered by the government 
legislation will be sent to congress to give menem sweeping 
authority to privatize state companies roig said 
defense minister italo luder said gen isidro caceres will 
replace gen francisco gassino as army chief of staff and brig 
jose julio will replace brig ernesto crespo as head of the air 
force 
caceres negotiated an end to the december military revolt led by 
col mohamed ali seineldin at the villa martelli barracks 
the navy chief and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff will 
also be replaced soon luder said

us forces said monday they deployed 
armored cars and helicopter gunships at a base near one of gen 
manuel antonio noriegas offices to bolster security after a bullet 
hit a us colonels home sundays show of force came a day after a 
bullet smashed through a secondstory window at the home of col 
jorge torres penetrated a wooden door and dropped to the floor less 
than one foot from his sons bed the us southern command said in 
a statement 
no one was injured but torres and his wife were shaken up 
the statement said 
it said the bullet was fired from a sovietmade ak47 rifle and 
came from the vicinity of chorillo a panama city neighborhood 
across a belt of water from the fort amador compound 
us authorities have verbally protested the incident because 
of its obvious threat to the safety of the us families and 
children who are residing at fort amador the incident is being 
investigated the statement said 
the exercise sunday was intended to test us responsiveness 
as well as reassure the families at amador of our ability to protect 
them it said 
panamanian defense force spokesmen refused immediate comment on 
the incident 
panamas defense forces have their headquarters in chorillo but 
noriega also maintains an office at fort amador a facility the 
countries share under the 1977 panama canal treaties 
noriega commands panamas defense forces and is the countrys de 
facto leader 
the southern command statement said helicopter gunships and 
armored personnel carriers of the 5th infantry division were 
deployed at fort amador for several hours sunday president bush 
sent in 5th division units in may after the noriegacontrolled 
government annulled elections the opposition appeared to be winning 
saturdays incident was the latest in a series that has 
contributed to growing tensions between us and noriega forces 
pronoriega demonstrators blocked the entrance to a us 
installation for half an hour last week and a us general said 
friday he thought washington should impose a military solution to 
remove noriega 
noriegas office at fort amador overlooks a us naval station 
and is across the street from a supply and intelligence 
headquarters he must pass us military police posts to get to the 
building 
the panamanians also use the fort as a training area and 
headquarters for several units gen omar torrijos who became a 
national hero when he signed the treaties returning the panama canal 
to panamanian control at the end of 1999 is buried on the grounds 
washington has imposed economic sanctions on the panamanian 
government in an effort to remove noriega since he was indicted on 
drug trafficking charges in florida 
noriega says the charges are trumped up and part of a us plot 
to renege on the canal treaties

a leading soviet space writer said in an article 
published monday the kremlin made a mistake by not broadcasting live 
television coverage when the us apollo 11 mission landed on the 
moon july 21 1969 
late on the night of july 21 1969 on central television if 
my memory doesnt trick me they broadcast the program pages of a 
musical spectacle yaroslav golovanov wrote in this weeks 
edition of the magazine ogonyok 
at that same moment all of mankind was holding its breath for 
the first landing of man on the moon 
soviet television carried extensive coverage of the linkup of the 
us apollo and soviet soyuz capsules in 1975 but largely ignored 
the american program to land on the moon 
by doing so golovanov wrote we showed a lack of respect for 
the astronauts for that country and for ourselves our people 
know about the apollo program by hearsay and are always amazed when 
they hear that 12 men have landed on the moon 
it is never too late to correct a mistake today 20 years 
after the first steps on the moon i want to recount the history of 
apollo 11 and its crew golovanov wrote in the first of a series 
of articles to appear in ogonyok the magazine has been in the 
forefront of glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs program of 
greater openness 
the article illustrated with blackandwhite photographs gave 
the biographies of the three crew members neil armstrong edwin 
buzz aldrin and michael collins and described the flight of 
the eagle lunar landing module 
the most dangerous moment of the flight golovanov wrote came 
when armstrong took manual control of the module for the final 
descent 
with tens of millions of television viewers around the world 
watching a live broadcast golovanov wrote armstrong set the craft 
down safely and man had landed on the moon a bold and ancient 
dream had come true

apples to be donated to charity in a 15 
million bailout of growers may contain traces of alar but will 
nonetheless be safe to eat the agriculture department said monday 
we are simply not going to be poisoning people said arthur 
whitmore a department spokesman they may or may not have alar in 
them but our position is that these apples are safe there is no 
reason not to eat apples 
the department announced friday it would spend up to 15 million 
in an effort to help reduce a huge surplus of apples created when 
consumers stopped buying amid fears over the use of alar 
as originally envisioned the department would have purchased the 
apples outright and then donated them to schools prisons public 
assistance food programs and others 
the department now plans to have the growers donate the apples to 
various groups and then be reimbursed by the department 
we would never formally take possession of the apples said 
whitmore adding that such programs are designed to correct market 
distortions involving surplus quantities of commodity 
the industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of 
apples from last years crop valued at between 40 million and 56 
million remain unsold with this years harvest only weeks away 
the department said that prices had fallen 3 to 4 per carton 
from what they were a year ago and the nations 20000 apple growers 
have estimated total losses at well over 100 million 
alar is used to enchance apple color ease of harvesting and life 
in storage 
the alar controversy began in late february when a private 
environmental advocacy group the natural resources defense council 
said eating apples treated with the chemical substantially increases 
the risk of cancer in children 
the environmental protection agency and the food and drug 
administration disputed the environmental groups report as a major 
exaggeration of the risk but sales fell immediately 
even though epa criticized the study the agency plans to ban the 
use of alar next spring and in the interim has proposed slashing the 
allowable limit on crops from 20 parts per million to one part per 
million 
the only manufacturer has withdrawn alar from the us market 
paul allen a spokesman for the natural resources defense 
council said monday that his group was not endorsing nor 
opposing the agriculture departments bailout 
an individual bite of an apple or a sip of apple juice that may 
have a trace of alar is not a great cause for alarm said allen 
the public health threat from alar involves prolonged exposure 
republican rep sid morrison an apple grower whose central 
washington state district produces roughly half of the nations 
apples said monday that even though many of the apples that will be 
donated through the usda program may have traces of the alar the 
levels will be within even the epas new proposed limits

four employees at the washington field office 
of the department of housing and urban development were reassigned 
monday to the agencys headquarters pending investigations of their 
roles in mismanagement officials believe cost the government 10 
million 
the four including the former head of the field office had been 
placed on 30day administrative leave at the outset of the 
investigation last month but that period expired monday hud 
officials exercised their option to place the four on 90day 
temporary assignments 
they will be assigned beginning tuesday to nonmanagement 
positions in four separate offices within hud headquarters said hud 
spokesman robert nipp they were notified of the move monday in 
letters from edwin gardner huds deputy undersecretary for field 
coordination 
the investigation continues nipp said 
an audit of the washington field office uncovered lax financial 
and management controls that allowed private closing agents hud 
contracts to handle the sale and acquisitions of singlefamily 
property to delay payments to the government and in some cases not 
make required payments 
audits of closing agents nationwide found similar problems in 
many states and those audits now are part of a congressional 
investigation into allegations of influencepeddling mismanagement 
and other problems at hud during the reagan administration 
secretary jack kemp scheduled to appear before congress on 
tuesday said monday that the agencys problems would not be used as 
an excuse to curtail housing programs designed to help low and 
moderateincome americans 
were not going to allow it to be a reason to close down the 
programs of hud kemp said in a brief reference to the scandal in 
a speech he made in detroit to the convention of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
the four washington workers reassigned to headquarters were i 
margaret white who had headed the district field office for five 
years robert b warner its director of housing management charles 
w womble a singlefamily home loan specialist and everett 
rothschild head of property disposition 
the field office oversees hud properties in the district of 
columbia and parts of maryland and virginia 
among the private closing agents in the region under scrutiny is 
marilyn harrell the socalled robin hud who has said she took 
55 million that belonged to hud and donated most of it to programs 
to help the poor 
about a dozen closing agents nationwide may have cost the 
government more than 20 million by withholding money owed the 
department or sending it in late costing the government interest

israels government was thrown into crisis 
monday when senior leaders of the leftleaning labor party voted to 
recommend leaving the coalition cabinet a move that could force 
national elections 
labors leadership bureau adopted a proposal which now goes to 
the partys decisionmaking central committee that accused prime 
minister yitzhak shamir of derailing efforts to end the palestinian 
uprising with tough new conditions set by his likud bloc labors 
coalition partner 
there is no room under these circumstances for the continuation 
of the government said finance minister shimon peres the labor 
chairman as he recommended pulling out of the cabinet 
his colleagues applauded loudly and passed his proposal 452 
with six abstentions 
later peres predicted elections in a few months 
i assume that the central committee will discuss when we 
want elections he told the national science institute when two 
parties come to a situation of disagreement and breaking apart 
they go for new elections 
labor legislators underscored their anger by walking out of 
parliament monday when it voted on five leftwing motions of no 
confidence 
the government easily overturned the motions by a vote of 4112 
votes with five abstentions 
it is the most serious crisis since the government was formed in 
december after weeks of negotiations with small religious parties 
the tel aviv stock market dropped 4 percent at the news 
but labor leaders gave themselves room to maneuver hinting they 
might not withdraw if real progress was made to arrange peace 
negotiations with palestinians before next months meeting of their 
1350member central committee 
shamir in a placatory effort said he will call for a vote at 
sundays cabinet meeting to reaffirm support for the government 
peace initiative israel television reported 
labor and likud which have ruled jointly since 1984 elections 
ended in virtual deadlock have survived several ideological crises 
some labor leaders said a final decision could hinge on next 
weeks visit by three us state department officials and whether 
they will make any progress toward starting an israeli peace 
dialogue with palestinians 
israeli reports said secretary of state james a baker iii had 
asked labor leaders through ambassador william brown to refrain from 
leaving the government fearing this would mire us efforts 
labors decision sparked anger in likud shamir called labors 
vote a mistaken decision and said dissolving the cabinet will 
leave no choice than to hold early elections which are not needed 
by the country at this moment 
the prime ministers bureau stresses and reiterates that the 
government peace plan is still alive a communique from his office 
said 
the statement also accused labor of playing into the hands of 
the arabs and relieving the arabs of any need to respond to the 
peace initiative the palestine liberation organization so far has 
rejected the plan 
shamir has said he agrees with conditions adopted by his party 
july 5 but that the tough stances are not binding on the peace 
iniative which calls for elections among palestinians in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
those elected are to negotiate with israel for autonomy with 
later talks deciding the territories final status 
peres the government vice premier argued in a fiery speech that 
likuds stance torpedoed the peace plan labors no 2 man defense 
minister yitzhak rabin said the plan had been castrated 
president hosni mubarak of egypt the only arab country that has 
signed a peace agreement with israel said in cairo the tough new 
conditions could undermine shamirs entire peace proposal 
peres especially criticized likuds demand that proposed 
elections be postponed until the uprising is ended at least 555 
palestinians and 35 israelis have died in the 19month revolt 
what does that mean granting veto power to all the extremists 
in the territories we shouldnt block negotiations just because the 
terrorists dont want them peres shouted 
he also objected to likuds demand to continue building jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories and its rejection of the 
usbacked formula of trading territory for peace 
the threehour meeting ended with labors central committee 
recommending that following the decisions of the likud central 
committee that harmed the changes of the governments peace 
initiative there is no room for the continuation of the 
government 
more than 60 leaders in the 120member bureau stayed away from 
the vote but peres expressed confidence the central committee would 
vote to pull out unless steps are taken to rescue the peace plan 
if labors 11 ministers quit the 26member cabinet shamir could 
technically form a narrow government with religious and rightwing 
factions but he said he expected new elections 
according to opinion polls likud stands a good chance of 
repeating its victory over labor in the last elections in november 
1988 when it got 40 seats to labors 39 in the 120member 
parliament

about 700 puppeteers gathered monday to 
show off their handy work in an effort to give new life to the 
inanimate objects 
puppetry is an ancient art and its been around probably as 
long as we have diane rains said as she smoothed the brown yarn 
hair of punch the 2foot plasticheaded star of her puppet 
company freshwater pearls 
were all here to try to keep it going said ms rains 34 a 
former zookeeper who abandoned work on a doctorate in veterinary 
physiology for the more creative rewards of puppeteering 
the 49th annual puppeteers of america national festival held on 
the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology covers just 
about anything a puppeteer would want to know the puppeteers of 
america based in pasadena calif has just 2000 members 
in workshops and performances puppeteers demonstrate their 
techniques and learn the history of puppetry the convention which 
runs through saturday also has a room filled with puppets 
marionette kits videos of puppet shows puppet wigs and even puppet 
postcards and puppet coloring books 
part conference and part theatrical marathon with daily puppet 
shows the festival is also a social occasion bringing puppeteers 
together from across the country 
its a very isolated profession said ms rains who with her 
husband stu janis put on a 19th century version of punch and 
judy in schools shopping malls and art fairs around minneapolis 
and st paul minn near their maplewood home 
puppeteers are usually very driven creative people said 
nancy laverick director of the festival youve brought life to 
something then emotion 
unlike asia and europe where for centuries puppetry has 
enlivened religious practices while entertaining and educating the 
united states remains largely an empty stage when it comes to 
puppets 
yes there was kukla fran and ollie and any puppeteer will 
credit jim henson and his muppets with giving puppetry a boost 
but there are only about two dozen fulltime puppet troupes akin 
to the puppet theaters of europe and asia according to janet 
bradley 46 of tears of joy theatre in vancouver wash 
her shows based on folk stories and myths are performed largely 
for schoolchildren 
for me these stories speak to us about life and death not 
wanting to grow up and about growing old i want to bring it to 
life she said this is real and alive and happening thats the 
essence of good theater

solidarity leader lech walesa has gone from 
fixing electric carts at the lenin shipyard to leading the strongest 
opposition movement in the history of the soviet bloc 
on tuesday the walesas lech and danuta are having special 
guests for lunch at the house they moved into just last year 
president bush and his wife barbara 
walesa repaired his last shipyard cart early this year before 
entering talks with communist authorities that led to the 
legalization of solidarity in april after a sevenyear ban and its 
landslide win in last months elections 
now the 45yearold walesa works in an office at the newly opened 
solidarity national headquarters 
i am fond of him walesa said monday of bush he is a 
highclass politician a great intellect quite straightforward a 
fantastic president 
the union leader also expressed his admiration for soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev describing him as a fantastic juggler 
i admire mr gorbachev walesa said on nbc news he is 
truly a great juggler of great class its such a gigantic country 
with such problems he has to be a great juggler to make it 
walesa and bush met during the thenvice presidents trip to 
poland in 1987 when they conferred at the us ambassadors 
residence in warsaw and together visited the grave of murdered 
prosolidarity priest the rev jerzy popieluszko 
the solidarity chief and 1983 nobel peace prize laureate has 
begun to assume the trappings of the globetrotting statesman and 
political leader he is he occasionally refers to himself as we 
but the father of eight retains a knack for the common touch 
that touch will be much in evidence when the bushes arrive for 
lunch at 54 polanki street in gdansk not far from the crowded 
highrise apartment block where the walesa family used to live 
the meal will be a private affair between the bushes and the 
walesas the only other person in attendance will be an interpreter 
who will be working not eating 
like any other guest the bushes will enter the walesa house 
through the back door walking through the kitchen on the way to the 
dining room 
walesa is proud of the house he purchased and renovated last year 
with earnings from his autobiography a way of hope 
a stuccoed brick singlefamily house that would raise no eyebrows 
in the united states or western europe it is a dwelling that many 
poles would regard as a palace compared to their typically cramped 
apartments 
it has a garden and small orchard where walesa will take bush for 
a stroll and space enough for a home office filled with mementoes 
walesa also has a satellite dish to pull in foreign television 
broadcasts on his color television 
the dining room is decorated with paintings of nature scenes and 
religious themes in the living room hangs a portrait of polishborn 
pope john paul ii my highest authority walesa calls him 
when walesa was traveling the country last fall meeting workers 
in the aftermath of a wave of strikes he sometimes had to explain 
the house to followers who feared he was putting on airs 
look i wrote a book he would answer i have eight kids 
the explanation usually sufficed 
after lunch bush will visit the workers monument outside the 
lenin shipyard where solidarity was born in august 1980 
danuta walesa 39 has put her friend grazyna pusz in charge of 
cooking for the bushes mrs puszs husband krzysztof is walesas 
longtime assistant 
the menu includes simple and wholesome polish dishes in an array 
that should make the walesas table groan 
appetizers will include smoked salmon and smoked eel the latter 
a gdansk specialty and a tray of polish cold cuts 
chlodnik a cold summertime soup made from beets and sour 
cream and mushroom soup will be next with the main course to 
include turkey veal pork with mushrooms beef and new potatoes 
dessert will be a jelly made from wild strawberries chocolate 
cake and a strawberry pie 
mrs walesa said she planned to just be sitting doing nothing 
and enjoying being the guest i trust my friend

president bush in a day of high symbolism 
and support for polands strides toward democracy offered on monday 
a modest economic aid package intended to help redeem the promise 
of a free polish republic 
a key element is a 100 million us fund provided congress 
approves to support the polish private sector as the soviet bloc 
country moves away from its marxist economy 
but the dimensions of the us offer could fall short of lech 
walesas aspirations the leader of the solidarity trade union 
movement is expected to ask bush on tuesday when they meet in gdansk 
to back a 10 billion program of international help for poland 
even so a clearly exhilirated bush assured the polish 
parliament where solidarity holds 260 of 560 seats that the 
western democracies will stand with the polish people and other 
peoples of this region 
although interrupted by applause five times and given a standing 
ovation at the end of his speech bush encountered little more than 
a correct response from the parliament and a tepid reception on the 
streets of warsaw 
the 4000 or so people that watched bushs 12car motorcade drive 
through the streets of this sweltering city waved small paper 
american flags listlessly occassionally there were shouts of 
long life long life 
the president wound up his busy day as guest at a state dinner 
hosted by the communist party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
striking much the same tone as in his speech to parliament bush 
said in a toast that poland was entering a new era and was 
beginning once again to command its own destiny 
for his part jaruzelski said in his toast that the polish 
government does not want to return to old resentments and 
emotions in its relations with the united states but hopes to 
look into the future to construct a sort of bridge across the 
atlantic 
as the presidents motorcade arrived at radziwill palace for the 
dinner demonstrators among 1000 people outside could be heard 
shouting down with communism and jaruzelski must go 
there was no indication whether bush could hear the protests 
which appeared to have been staged by splinter opposition groups 
jaruzelski in an interview with abc news praised his meeting 
with bush saying it was a very rich day rich in substance rich 
in political facts 
he also said he consulted with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
and added i really am heartened that the leaders of the two big 
powers are guided by the same intentions and i feel that this bodes 
well for the future 
earlier bush squeezed in a short pitching session with polish 
little leaguers 
handing his dark suit jacket to his wife barbara the president 
put an orange fielders glove on his right hand and powered a 
baseball to a 12yearold polish pitching star on the back lawn of 
us ambassador john daviss residence 
make sure he doesnt throw it wild and wipe my wife out 
bush the captain of the 1948 yale university baseball team told 
his security guard as adam szczepanski returned the presidents 
offering with equal force 
the wellattended session was designed to support the development 
of americas national pastime in this european country 
as for the offer of financial assistance bush 
pledged to ask congress for a 100 million enterprise fund 
to support polish entrepreneurs moreover he said he will ask other 
industrialized democracies to undertake similar initiatives at this 
weekends western economic summit meeting in paris 
said he would also ask congress to approve 15 million to fight 
air and water pollution in krakow once the royal capital 
promised to open a us educational and cultural center in 
warsaw poland he added should do the same in the united states 
told the parliament he would ask his six summit partners to 
quickly support rescheduling of up to 5 billion of polands 
staggering international debt of 39 billion 
said he would encourage the world bank to proceed with 325 
million in loans to help polish agriculture and industry reach the 
production levels that they are clearly capable of 
but bush stressed that the aid would come with a string attached 
that poland would have to adopt austerity measures 
there can be no substitute for polands own efforts he said 
telling the parliament i must speak honestly economic reform 
and recovery cannot occur without sacrifices 
bush told the parliament that poland must choose either a free 
market economy or socialism your responsibility for your 
countrys future is immense he said 
jaruzelski acknowledged as much in introducing bush to 
parliament 
we are fully aware that the biggest work is up to us ourselves 
but we do not want to be alone the general said 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski told bush the speech 
contained many thoughts permeated with realism foreign minister 
tadeusz olechowski said his nation was not looking for a rain of 
gold 
secretary of state james a baker iii told a news conference the 
primary objective of the us aid package is to lower polish 
inflation from its current 100 percent and to ease government 
subsidies for heavy industry 
baker said that bush in devising his package recognizes there 
will be some trying times ahead for poland in meeting us and 
international standards 
bush himself cautioned parliament that the united states would 
not provide unsound credits made without regard to the necessary 
reforms 
two years ago the parliament withheld its support from an 
austerity program that would have meant increases of 100 percent or 
more in rents and food prices 
addressing the parliament bush also sought to inspire polish 
reformers 
he said that now this generations calling is to redeem the 
promise of a free polish republic poland has not been lost so long 
as the polish spirit lives 
earlier in a speech at a luncheon with jaruzelski who is 
playing a pivotal role in restructuring the polish economic and 
political systems bush called on both the party and solidarity to 
rise above the mistrust and work together to meet common 
challenges 
the united states will stand with poland bush declared we 
will support polands hopeful mission unparalleled in your 
history 
bush also paid his respects at the tomb of the unknown soldier 
then visited the site of the warsaw ghetto bowing his head in 
tribute to the oncevibrant jewish community that was annihilated 
after standing virtually alone against the world war ii nazi 
occupation 
a rabbi in the black kaftan of the hasidic movement quietly 
said a prayer as tears streamed down the cheeks of a handful of the 
remnants of polish jewry 
bushs visit to poland is the first stop on a 10day trip to 
europe that includes the firstever visit by an american president 
to hungary he also will travel to paris for a sevennation economic 
summit and stop briefly in the netherlands

when soviet scientists arrived monday to 
formally exchange copies of a scientific agreement with us 
scientists they came bearing gifts 
the americans had none and had to scramble to find something to 
present their guests 
two soviet geologists attending the 28th international geological 
congress met monday at a news conference with dallas peck director 
of the us geological survey to initiate formally an agreement to 
share geological research 
the first soviet speaker yeveny a kozlovsky former president 
of the ussr ministry of geology presented peck with a highly 
polished purple stone sphere sitting within a half sphere of 
polished green stone both stones gleamed with a gemlike quality and 
kozlovsky said they represented the earth and its core 
peck responded with a group of maps identical to those being 
handed out routinely next door in the press room 
the second soviet speaker md pelmenev deputy minister of 
geology presented peck with a cut and polished stone on which a 
forest scene had been created using particles of colored gemstone 
peck was able to respond with a back copy of a us geology 
magazine that had been hastily gathered up by an aide 
obviously embarassed by the fact that the americans had not 
prepared for an exchange of gifts peck told the soviets we start 
this off by our owing you one 
the agreement calls for american and soviet geologists to 
exchange the results of research conducted in their respective 
countries it eventually will lead to an exchange of field trips

two countries the two countries reached the agreement after two 
years of negotiation and the ceremony monday marked the formal

two explosions rocked mecca monday 
injuring an unspecified number of moslems in islams holiest city 
for an annual pilgrimage the official saudi arabian press agency 
said the agency made no mention of fatalities 
the blasts occurred at 10 pm one was on the main road leading 
to the grand mosque of kaaba the agency said quoting an 
unidentified security official in mecca the second explosion was 
near an overpass the agency said 
the agency indicated the blasts were caused by bombs but gave no 
details 
an estimated 18 million moslems from more than 80 countries are 
in mecca as part of an annual pilgrimage to the city the birthplace 
of the prophet mohammed during the pilgrimage known as hajj 
moslems also travel to medina to visit the tomb of the 7th century 
founder of islam 
this criminal perpetration at a sacred spot is regrettable 
the saudi news agency quoted the security official as saying an 
investigation is under way and details will be released as soon as 
available 
it was not immediately clear who was responsible for the 
explosions iranian extremists have in the past clashed with 
security forces in mecca near the red sea in western saudi arabia 
iran monday branded saudi government officials terrorists 
according to tehrans official islamic republic news agency in 
response saudi arabias king fahd heightened security in mecca and 
medina 
last year saudi arabia began limiting the number of pilgrims to 
mecca and medina based on a countrys population 
the head of the iranian organization that arranges pilgrimages to 
the cities then told iranians to skip the ritual for 10 years to 
protest saudi control of the shrines 
the pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since 
irans islamic revolution in 1979 in that year religious 
extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca and held it for two 
weeks before saudi forces stormed it 
more than 250 people were killed including 100 of the iranian 
extremists saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more 
the saudis arrested scores of iranian revolutionary guards posing 
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and 
explosives 
the next year 402 pilgrims mostly iranians were killed in 
riots in mecca that the saudis say were instigated by 
fundamentalists

affordable housing will remain unreachable for 
nearly half the nations black and hispanic families during the next 
decade unless significant changes are made in government policies 
according to a recent study 
the study by the private center on budget and policy priorities 
said the situation could worsen in the 1990s 
the study released monday said affordable housing is beyond the 
reach of nearly half the nations black and hispanic families and 
blacks and hispanics of all income levels are much more likely than 
whites to live in substandard housing 
using recently released data from the department of housing and 
urban development and the census bureau the research center which 
frequently advocates increased spending on social programs found 
that 42 percent of all black and hispanic households spent more on 
housing in 1985 than is considered affordable compared with 27 
percent of all whites 
under standards established by hud housing is considered 
affordable if it consumes no more than 30 percent of a familys 
income 
the study said housing problems are especially severe among poor 
minority households with nearly four out of five paying for housing 
costs outside the affordable range 
forty percent of poor hispanic households and 37 percent of poor 
black households were spending at least 70 percent of their income 
on housing costs in 1985 leaving little money for food and other 
necessities the study said 
and while black and hispanic households make up 17 percent of all 
households in the country they make up 42 percent of those 
occupying substandard housing and more than half of those living in 
units with holes in the floor or evidence of rats 
these stark findings indicate that the growing lack of 
affordable housing has reached a crisis stage for blacks and 
hispanics as well as for lowincome americans in general said 
robert greenstein director of the center 
although the study was based on 1985 data the report said 
housing costs burdens are unlikely to have eased since then because 
rental costs and the average income of poor families have risen at 
about the same pace 
in 1985 the study said the typical poor minority household had 
an income of less than 5000 and spent 57 percent of its income on 
housing 
these high housing cost burdens are likely to have contributed 
substantially to the growing problem of homelessness and to have 
intensified other problems such as the rising incidence of 
hunger said edward b lazere the studys principal author 
when poor families must spend so much of their limited incomes for 
housing little money remains for other necessities 
although the housing cost burdens of poor white households are as 
severe as the burdens of poor hispanic and black households 
hispanics and blacks are much more likely to be poor than are whites 
and therefore are more likely to face the high housing cost 
burdens associated with poverty the study said 
it said problems faced by poor households of all races in finding 
affordable housing have worsened since the 1970s the increase in 
the shortage of lowrent housing since 1978 can be traced primarily 
to a sharp increase in the number of poor families a substantial 
reduction in the number of lowrent units in the housing stock and 
an increase in rental charges it said

the fbi returned three stolen 
f16 jet fighter engines to the air force on monday after processing 
them for evidence an agent said 
however fbi agent tim screen would neither confirm nor deny 
reports the disappearance of the 2 million engines was part of a 
19month sting operation aimed at a purported theft ring at the 
base 
asked if suspects had been identified or if arrests were 
imminent screen said were working on that now were 
investigating certain people he declined to say whether the 
people were on base 
sen orrin hatch rutah said in washington that department of 
defense officials had told him a great number of other thefts had 
been reported at hill he said many countries would love to get 
hold of the engines to figure out our technology 
this looks like it will be a strong embarrassment for the state 
of utah he said it involves lots of dollars thats all i can 
say 
the pratt amp whitney f100pw200 engines were reported missing 
last wednesday by maintenance personnel returning from the 
independence day holiday base officials said the engines are each 
17 feet long 34 inches in diameter and weigh 3200 pounds 
the fbi turned the engines and a towing vehicle over to the air 
force at 330 am after checking them for evidence at a secret fbi 
storage facility in salt lake city about 30 miles to the south 
screen said 
screen said further information was not available pending the 
outcome of an investigation by the fbi the department of defense 
and the air force office of special investigations 
hatch said the investigation was close to concluding and that he 
had been told the theft apparently was committed by hill employees 
or others familiar with base operations 
they knew enough to cut locks on a gate and replace them with 
similar locks the senator said adding that the engines 
apparently were taken from the base through a gate north of the 
taxiway that is not patrolled often 
seventytwo f16 fighters are assigned to the 388th tactical 
fighter wing the bases main group while 24 are used for the air 
force reserve 419th wing

prisoners allegedly executed in iran since the ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war

peoples holy warriors claimed those executed were tortured and 
that many political prisoners were being killed under the pretext of 
a crackdown on drug traffickers

sent by telex to the associated press in nicosia rajavi said names 
on the list sent to un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
formed only a fraction of politically inspired killings carried 
out since a unsponsored ceasefire aug 20 halted eight years of 
war between iran and iraq his claims could not be confirmed 
independently 
the united nations and international humanitarian agencies 
including londonbased amnesty international earlier this year 
accused iran of executing several hundred political detainees 
rajavi said a new wave of executions and arrests followed the 
june 3 death of irans spiritual leader the ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini 
in the month that has elapsed since khomeinis death the 
remnants of his regime have continued street executions on an 
extensive scale to terrorize the people the statement said

president corazon aquino of the 
philippines on monday asked government and industrial leaders to 
expand economic ties with her nation 
mrs aquino on the first stop of her weeklong threenation 
european tour met with west german president richard von 
weizsaecker foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and other 
officials 
mrs aquino comparing the task of strengthening the heavily 
indebted philippine economy to the recovery of west germany after 
world war ii asked that germany share its experience with her 
homeland 
we have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at 
the price of inflation nor debt relief at the price of national 
honor she said in a speech to the west german chamber of industry 
and trade 
we have paid as careful attention to the consequences of 
runaway inflation and devaluation as germany in the light of her own 
experiences between the wars she said 
mrs aquino said the philippines debt was projected to increase 
to 29 billion by years end but that much was money that was in 
fact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictator 
ferdinand marcos 
she said that since her government took over in 1986 the 
countrys growth rate of minus 10 percent under marcos in 1985 had 
improved to a rate of plus 67 percent by 1988 
what we need to complete the equation are two elements 
essential to the german recovery debt relief and investments 
mrs aquino said 
during a state banquet in the evening weizsaecker told mrs 
aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between west 
germany and the philippines 
weizsaecker said the philippines have had good results in trade 
with west germany and assured mrs aquino that the barrierfree 
market the european economic community plans for 1992 will not lock 
out trade with other countries 
mrs aquino who arrived in west germany on sunday will meet 
with chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday before departing for paris 
she also is to visit belgium

the state department said monday it expects the 
indian government to cooperate in clamping strict controls on the 
export of chemicals that can be used to make poison gas and other 
chemical weapons 
it is our hope that all countries including india which are 
capable of manufacturing the precursors needed to produce these 
deadly weapons will institute very strict controls on their 
exports department spokesman richard boucher told reporters 
he was commenting on a new york times report that the tightening 
of controls on the export of substances useful in chemical weapons 
by the united states japan and european nations has made indian 
companies major sources for shipments of such material to iran iraq 
and egypt 
the spread of chemical weapons is a global problem of concern 
and i think its a mutual concern that we share with other 
countries such as india boucher said 
the united states is discussing with india and other countries 
how to curb this spread he said adding were confident that the 
government of india will be taking all measures to control this 
trade 
boucher did not name the other countries and said he could not 
rank the importance of various countries as suppliers 
he said he was unable to describe the indian response to us 
concerns except to say that we for our part are very hopeful 
that we can work with the indian government to control the flow of 
these chemicals 
an indian embassy statement issued late monday in washington said 
that india is not involved in the production or trading of 
chemical weapons as a matter of policy and is committed to their 
total elimination 
it added that only recently had there come to indias attention 
the problem of dualuse items which have legitimate commercial 
applications in the pesticide industry etc there is no 
wellestablished international regime to take care of such 
chemicals 
it said the united states appreciated indias facilitating the 
return of a shipment of 257 tons of indianmade thionyl chloride an 
essential of mustard gas that is widely traded for the manufacture 
of pesticides after its movement from india to iran via dubai was 
halted by the west german trading company that reportedly brokered 
the deal

us district judge robert aguilar faced a 
court for the first time as a criminal defendant monday and pleaded 
innocent to eight felony charges 
aguilar 58 was indicted by a federal grand jury last month on 
charges he used his office to do favors for convicted felons 
among other things he is alleged to have sought favorable 
treatment for two felons from other federal judges and tipped off an 
exmobster about a courtordered wiretap in the process the 
indictment said aguilar turned his office into a racketeering 
enterprise to obstruct justice 
aguilar a 1980 appointee of president carter has not commented 
but his lawyers contend the case is politically motivated because of 
aguilars liberal record and his rulings against the government in 
several important cases 
if convicted aguilar faces up to 55 years in prison the 
indictment is the fourth this decade against a federal judge and the 
first racketerring charge ever against a federal judge 
mondays arraignment before visiting us district judge howard 
bratton of albuquerque nm lasted less than 20 minutes and 
aguilar stood with his lawyers before the bench for less than three 
minutes 
dressed in a gray business suit he repeated the plea is not 
guilty to the first two charges read by the court clerk before 
bratton said further reading of the charges was unnecessary 
allowed to go free without bail aguilar left through a rear exit 
without talking to reporters 
aguilar who can be removed from office only by congressional 
impeachment has retained his judges title and 89500 salary but 
relinquished most of his duties while the case is pending 
justice department prosecutor ralph martin did not object to the 
nobail release but asked bratton to prohibit aguilar from 
contacting any potential witnesses martin noted that one charge 
accuses the judge of advising a witness to lie to the grand jury 
bratton refused the request 
defense lawyer patrick hallinan told reporters the request would 
have barred aguilar from speaking to half of his family and 
described it as part of the governments campaign to portray aguilar 
as a corrupt judge

a poison control center physician said monday 
she knows of 19 children who have swallowed batteries from the new 
ghostblaster toy offered by hardees restaurants as a 
promotional gimmick tied to the ghostbuster ii movie 
at company headquarters in rocky mount nc hardees said it 
was altering the 2 million remaining toys to seal the battery 
compartments and strengthen package warnings 
dr toby litovitz medical director of the capital poison control 
center at georgetown university hospital said 19 calls have been 
received by the centers hotline over a 10day period about children 
between 1 and 3 years old swallowing the button batteries that 
operate the toys 
the center receives calls from all over the country including 
from other hospitalbased poison control centers 
calls from anxious parents have come from everywhere and this 
is just the tip of the iceberg she said 
she said she believed based on past experience that as many as 
100 more incidents have gone unreported 
hardees restaurants began offering the promotional toys june 28 
allowing patrons who purchase a meal or a dessert to buy the small 
rectangle noisemaker in one of four colors for 179 the toy comes 
in red black white or gray and makes one of two different kinds of 
noise to send away the ghost 
hardees distributed 2 million of the toys in a week and has 2 
million more on hand said john merritt vice president for public 
affairs of hardees 
hardees officials decided not enough attention was being paid to 
posted warnings that the toys were not appropriate for children 
under age 3 merritt said 
little 6yearold johnny which this toy is designed for 
leaves it lying around and his little brother gets it open and eats 
the battery he said 
hardees informed the consumer product safety commission of the 
problem and agreed to place similar warnings directly on the plastic 
cases sealing the battery compartments at the same time he said 
merritt said the company knew of no injuries associated with 
swallowing the batteries 
every year at christmas children ingest all kinds of small 
parts and are none the worse for wear he said but its not 
good for you 
merritt said anyone who already has a ghostblaster can return 
it to any restaurant to have it altered 
officials of the consumer product safety commission said they 
were discussing an announcement about the toy with the company 
dr litovitz said the center averages about 400 button battery 
ingestion cases a year but never so many from a single product 
its not an issue for hysteria because the batteries usually 
pass through without a problem said dr litovitz 
the small batteries also can be put into noses and ears causing 
hearing loss or facial deformity she cautioned 
she said parents should seek medical attention immediately for 
any child swallowing a battery if the battery becomes lodged in the 
esophagus there is a risk of perforation and death she said 
chemicals leaking from the battery could cause severe burns to 
the esophagus she said

radiation equipment at a 
sterilization plant was shut down after three men were exposed to 
radiation while trying to do repair work the plant manager said 
monday 
orlando lemus manager of the plant on the eastern edge of san 
salvador said two of the men suffered serious injuries in the 
accident on feb 5 the two remained hospitalized in mexico city on 
monday 
the plant owned by delmed sa makes plastic medical equipment 
such as plasma bags and catheters cobalt and nuclear technology 
provided by the canadian firm nordion is used to sterilize the 
equipment 
lemus said the accident resulted purely from human error and 
that the salvadoran ministry of labor had determined there was no 
negligence on the part of the plant 
but one of those injured said the accident was caused by 
mechanical failure 
the source of radiation got stuck im the mechanic on duty i 
had to work on it francisco roque tobar said 
he spoke from a mexico city hospital where he and jose luis 
martinez were being treated the hospital would not disclose their 
conditions but tobar said one of his legs was amputated last week 
lemus said tobar 26 and two other employees entered a chamber 
in which a rod of cobalt 60 had failed to return to a safe position 
in a protective pool of water 
tobar failed to use a portable radiation monitor and he and the 
other two men apparently ignored an alarm system warning them that 
something was wrong lemus said 
tobar said he wasnt wearing a monitor but that the alarm system 
goes off so frequently that he ignored it 
you have to go in to repair the equipment tobar said 
canadian press quoted nordion spokeswoman donna coates as saying 
two company engineers arrived in el salvador on feb 12 to help with 
the malfunctioning equipment but were not told there had been a 
serious accident 
they got the rod to return to the protective pool and rendered 
the equipment inoperable the canadian news agency said

a federal prosecutor testifying monday at the 
start of hearings in the impeachment trial of judge alcee l 
hastings said he was shocked that the judge ordered the return of 
845000 forfeited in a racketeering case 
i was stunned at the order reversing the forfeiture james 
deichert chief of the justice departments organized crime strike 
force in atlanta told a panel of 12 senators hearing evidence 
against hastings 
deichert said that nothing had changed in the months since 
hastings had ordered two brothers thomas and frank romano to 
forfeit the money as proceeds from racketeering operations 
everything was identical and out of the blue he was reversing 
himself he said 
deichert was the leadoff witness at the evidence hearings at 
which members of the house acting as prosecutors promised to prove 
that hastings conspired to get a 150000 payoff to keep the romano 
brothers out of prison and restore their money to them 
the romano brothers never took part in any such plot and both 
have died since their december 1980 racketeering conviction 
following a trial at which hastings was the judge and deichert was 
the prosecutor 
hastings is accused of taking part in a plot with washington 
attorney william borders in which a gobetween carrying messages to 
the romanos was actually taking orders from the strike force and an 
fbi undercover agent posed as one of the brothers 
by coincidence hastings trial in the senate got under way on 
the day that us district judge robert aguilar entered pleas of 
innocent in san francisco to eight charges relating to accusations 
that he used his office to do favors for convicted felons it was 
the fourth indictment of a federal judge in the decade of the 1980s 
and the first to involve racketeering charges 
judge hastings actions present a pattern of misconduct 
which cannot be tolerated in a united states district judge rep 
john bryant dtexas said as hearings got under way 
hastings also is accused of lying to the federal jury that 
acquitted him of criminal charges in the matter in 1983 and 
improperly disclosing information obtained from a federal wiretap 
hastings was impeached by the house a year ago if convicted by 
the senate he would be removed from the us district court bench 
and deprived of his 89500 annual salary 
much of the opening remarks of both house judiciary committee 
members who are serving as prosecutors and the judges own attorney 
terence anderson of miami represented a review of material that has 
become familiar in congress over the last two years 
its deja vu all over again hastings told reporters in a 
hallway outside the hearing room in the hart senate office building 
he also called the proceeding an abomination because they 
consisted of the same old stuff and i really resent it quite 
frankly 
the senate is holding the evidentiary hearings before a special 
committee rather than tie up the floor for weeks and thus prevent 
action on legislation 
the proceedings are being videotaped for the viewing of other 
senators who evntually will vote on the floor on whether to convict 
hastings 
the cablesatellite public affairs network cspan carried the 
proceedings to cable viewers nationwide 
bryant lead counsel for the house said that the senate should 
expel hastings from the federal bench despite his 1983 acquittal he 
said the acquittal was the product of repeated lies and the 
production of fabricated evidence at his criminal trial 
it is an acquittal that cannot be overturned bryant said 
judge hastings cannot be prosecuted again but he can be removed 
from office 
hastings attorney portrayed his client as the innocent dupe of 
washington attorney william borders whom he described as a big 
time rainmaker with career criminals for friends 
alcee l hastings was is and will forever be an innocent 
man declared anderson as the dapper judge looked on impassively 
anderson also attacked another potential witness william dredge 
as a bigtime fence and career informant who was desperate 
to provide the fi with evidence against a big fish to keep out 
of prison himself 
dredge is expected to testify on tuesday behind closed doors in a 
highsecurity hearing room designed for the senate intelligence 
committee 
reporters and cameras will be barred he fears retaliation 
bryant told newsmen because he has been a government witness in a 
major labor racketeering trial involving top cosa nosa hoodlums 
we dont want anyone to see his face bryant said 
borders who wielded considerable political influence in the 
1970s was convicted of briberyconspiracy after pulling out of a 
suburban virginia motel parking garage with a clothing bag stuffed 
with 125000 in cash and an fbi undercover agent posing as a 
criminal by his side 
hastings in washington at the time for a testimonial dinner 
honoring borders quickly hopped a plane for florida after learning 
of the arrest fbi agents found him later that night in his 
attorneys home in miami 
bryant said the hasty exit was evidence of hastings guilt but 
anderson scoffed at that saying the judge spent two hours with 
the fbi that night and he responded to every one of their 
questions 
he was not an avaricious man anderson declared this is 
not a man who set out to make money

jim bakkers former executive secretary 
said monday she had unlimited authority to sign the tv evangelists 
name on checks and other documents 
he liked it the signature to look like his said shirley 
fulbright testifying at the federal tax evasion trial of two former 
ptl officials brothers david and james taggart i tried my best 
miss fulbright also said david taggart once boasted he had job 
security at ptl because of things he knew about bakker who built 
the evangelical empire before stepping down in 1987 in a sex and 
money scandal 
i vaguely remember a comment he made in jest jokingly in 
which he said something to the effect that mr bakker would not fire 
him or me because of some of the things we knew about him miss 
fulbright said 
he laughingly said he knew a lot about jim bakker thats 
all she said when pressed by special prosecutor david brown for 
specifics 
the taggarts are charged with failing to pay 487000 in taxes 
from 1984 to 1987 on 11 million that prosecutors say the taggarts 
diverted from the ministry for their personal use by taking cash 
advances on ptl credit cards and using blank ministry checks 
bakker is charged in charlotte nc with fraud and conspiracy 
concerning ptl operations a federal magistrate ruled monday that 
bakker can be tried in that city without fear of pretrial publicity 
because two years have elapsed since his resignation drew media 
coverage of the holy war in television ministries 
miss fulbright testified that she signed bakkers name to several 
documents authorizing payment to the taggarts without bakkers 
knowledge one memorandum authorized ptl to pay james taggarts 
interior design firm a 10000amonth retainer another authorized 
a 100000 payment to the firm 
she said she also signed an authorization to pay david taggart a 
120000 bonus shortly before bakkers resignation 
miss fulbright testified she signed bakkers name at the 
direction of david taggart 
did this ever cause you concern miss fulbright brown asked 
her 
at that moment i did not know what it represented she said 
later on i realized what they did represent 
under crossexamination miss fulbright testified that bakker 
previously had given her the authority to sign his name on 
documents including checks letters and memos miss fulbright said 
she knew of no limitations on her authority to use bakkers 
signature and said her work was personally examined by bakker 
i assumed i could sign everything if it were necessary 
she said 
witnesses have testified that the taggarts shared expenses on an 
apartment in exclusive trump towers in new york city gave each 
other jaguars for christmas presents and bought expensive jewelry at 
cartier and gucci 
if convicted the taggarts could each receive 30 years in prison 
and fines totaling 135 million

the citys district attorney asked a federal 
judge on monday to reinstate laws that make abortions illegal 
saying the case could challenge the us supreme courts stand on 
abortion 
district attorney harry connick acting in the wake of last 
weeks us supreme court decision requested the return of state 
laws that make abortions criminal 
us district judge martin feldman scheduled a hearing for aug 9 
the supreme court seems to be issuing an invitation to people 
to resolve this highly emotional issue connick told a news 
conference i would think everyone interested in the issue 
regardless of the standpoint would be very anxious to see it 
settled 
the louisiana legislature approved a resolution last week 8113 
asking district attorneys to enforce the criminal statutes in light 
of the supreme court decision on webster vs reproductive health 
services a missouri case 
that decision stopped short of overturning the 1973 roe vs wade 
decision under which women have the right to seek abortions but 
allowed states to impose new restrictions on abortions 
connick said the legislatures intent was to enforce the laws 
which have remained on the books but were not enforced because they 
were found unconstitutional under roe 
the court should make a new judgment not just based on roe 
but also in light of webster because the laws have changed 
radically said john baker jr connicks lawyer and a law 
professor at louisiana state university 
both men said the supreme courts recent decision represents a 
change in law and requires a different outcome from that received in 
1976 when the abortion laws were ruled unenforceable 
michelle gross president of a local chapter of the national 
organization for women said her group met with connick for about an 
hour before he made his announcement 
it was expected but we are very angry about it in our meeting 
today with mr connick he said he didnt know anything about the 
case or whether the statute of limitations would apply in the 
case gross said 
we are going back to the district attorneys office tomorrow 
and we are going to be there every day until he decides to get off 
this very dangerous path he is treading we feel strongly that 
he is trying to seek fame and power off the backs of women she 
said 
louisiana state law declares that the unborn child is a human 
being from the moment of conception and is therefore a legal 
person for purposes of the unborn childs right to life 
the statutes outlaw abortions the distribution of drugs that 
cause abortion and the display of abortion advertising 
under the laws a woman who undergoes an abortion is not liable 
for punishment only the person who performs the procedure 
women who undergo abortions to save their lives and those who 
perform them would not be affected if the laws became enforceable 
said a statement by connicks office 
connicks motion for reconsideration said 15 states still have 
abortion laws on the books 
it is apparent that a majority of the supreme court is prepared 
to uphold state abortion statutes if those statutes are reasonably 
related to protecting human life and indeed to protecting potential 
human life the motion said 
in light of this new development in the law it is our view 
that a majority of the supreme court would have little trouble 
upholding louisianas criminal abortion statutes it said 
connick argued that this attack through the courts was preferable 
to testing the law by arresting a doctor

the doomsayers had said that allowing 
hardworking icelanders to drink strong beer would turn them into 
lazy roundtheclock drunks 
but since bday on march 1 when strong beer flowed legally 
for the first time in 74 years the police have reported no increase 
in drunken driving and bar owners say people still restrict their 
hard drinking to weekends 
icelanders are happier and less drunk said gudrun 
helgadottir president of the althing parliament and a sponsor of 
the legislation legalizing beer with alcoholic content above 225 
percent 
antialcohol campaigners however report backsliding by some 
recovered alcoholics and worry about more imbibing in general 
especially among the young 
bday was celebrated with parties pub openings and even a 
few free drinks and although stong beer is expensive it is now the 
favorite alcoholic beverage in this north atlantic island nation of 
250000 
in the first month icelanders consumed nearly 13 million quarts 
of beer about 51 quarts for every man woman and child 
hoskuldur jonsson general manager of the state wine spirit and 
tobacco authority said once the novelty wore off beer consumption 
dropped to between 635000 and 690000 quarts a month 
the wave went over and we are now sailing on a rather calm 
sea jonsson said 
olafur arnason director of the statefunded liquor prevention 
council of iceland says total alcohol sales rose 25 percent in the 
first three months of 1989 and that state institutions for 
alcoholics are reporting more admissions of exalcoholics who had 
been sober for several years 
to combat an increase in drinking by 18 to 20yearolds the 
council has put out an advertisement showing a cartoon of a young 
person with no head 
god gave you intelligence dont drink it away it says 
until march 1 icelanders could drink whiskey vodka wine 
lowalcohol beer or brennivin the national strong spirit also 
called black death but they could not legally buy strong beer 
except at airport dutyfree stores 
iceland ended 25 years of total prohibition in 1933 but a legal 
quirk kept all but the weakest beers banned a powerful temperance 
lobby kept it that way until may 1988 when the althing lifted the 
prohibition 
the argument of opponents was that beer would increase the 
consumption of icelanders and theyd be drunk all day mrs 
helgadottir said 
what weve seen is that the sale of strong spirits has fallen 
and the police are very happy there is less fighting on the 
streets on friday and saturday less violence as a whole 
jonsson said consumption of white wine fell by 30 percent in 
march and strong spirits especially white spirits like vodka by 
10 percent 
i worried if we would have the same attitude to beer drinking 
during working hours as they do in germany and denmark he said 
that hasnt happened he added and some police tell me its 
easier to deal with people who drink beer than strong spirits 
because they are less violent or more sleepy or not as quick in 
their reactions 
another positive effect he said has been the collapse of the 
thriving black market in smuggled beer which is equally expensive 
a glass in a bar costs 340 to 420 a sixpack in the state 
liquor stores costs 1050 to 1190 the top seller is west 
germanys lowenbrau brewed here under license 
oskar sveinsson a waiter at icelands oldest pub gaukur a 
stong said up to 60 percent of sales were now beer but he added 
people have found that if they drink a lot of beer they get a lot 
of headaches so if they are going to get drunk they drink 
something else mainly vodka 
chuck fleenor of bluefield wva who worked behind the bar at 
the duushus pub on bday said i think people have become 
more mellow now before they were drinking harder whiskey and 
things would get a little rowdy on weekends

the new government of president 
alfredo christiani is proposing stiff prison terms for those taking 
part in activities of union peasant and human rights organizations 
considered guerrilla fronts 
the christian democratic party which handed over power in june 
to the rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena termed 
the bill fascist 
the entire political opposition has condemned the draft 
legislation which seems certain to be passed by arenas legislative 
majority 
opponents say the bill which overhauls the penal code 
drastically erodes constitutional rights including freedom of the 
press 
the new yorkbased committee to protect journalists sent a telex 
message to cristiani expressing alarm that the legislation will 
severely hamper journalists ability to exercise their 
internationally recognized right to pursue their profession 
the government says the legislation is necessary to combat 
terrorism 
it was presented to the unicameral legislature late in june amid 
a spate of assassinations and bombings authorities blamed on 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front or fmln 
the insurgents have denied responsibility for attacks on 
nonmilitary officials and say some members of the far right are 
employing terrorist tactics to eliminate rivals 
they also accuse the government and military of wanton violence 
in an effort to gain support for harsh legislative measures 
a 9yearold civil war between the marxistled rebels and the 
salvadoran government has left an estimated 70000 dead most of 
them civilians 
the legislation provides for prison terms of up to 30 years for 
those convicted of murder kidnapping armed assault or sabotage 
intended to provoke a state of terror 
it also provides up to 20 years in prison for those who take part 
in peaceful takeovers or sitins at public buildings schools 
embassies or churches those who block traffic with demonstrations 
or marches as well as those who paint slogans on public or private 
buildings could be sentenced to five years 
dozens of leftleaning popular organizations of workers 
peasants displaced people and rights activists routinely employ 
marches sitins and graffiti to express their views 
the legislation provides for up to 10 years in prison for anyone 
who voluntarily collaborates toward the realization of the goals 
of any terrorist group band or organization 
authorities consider most popular organizations fronts for 
fmln activity the state pays for advertisements in newspapers 
explicitly linking union rights and peasant groups to the insurgent 
army 
the popular organizations deny the charges 
this is the old seaandfish thesis said the rev segundo 
montes a jesuit priest and director of the human rights institute 
of the prestigious central american university he referred to the 
tenet that guerrilla forces the fish move undetected through a 
sympathetic populace the sea 
but the sea is now more than the rural population he said 
it includes unions and humanitarian organizations the right sees 
demands for higher wages not as demands for higher wages but as 
support for marxist revolution 
the object of this law is to make repression legal to destroy 
everything leftist he said in an interview 
the local and international press corps are concerned about the 
bills provision of a maximum fouryear prison term for anyone who 
in any manner spreads or promulgates propaganda that subverts the 
public order 
the draft does not define what constitutes subversion of the 
public order 
communications minister mauricio sandoval met with local and 
foreign reporters in an attempt to assure them that the law was not 
designed to restrict the press but the journalists left the meeting 
unsatisfied 
the laws sweeping language could be interpreted to include 
almost any type of legitimate reporting said the committee to 
protect journalists telex message to cristiani 
the christian democrats in a communique labeling the proposed 
law fascist said it was an attack on the most elemental human 
rights and an attempt to impose state terrorism that would favor 
the fmln and prejudice the people

along the muddy maroni river 
deep in the amazon rain forest thousands of refugees wait for an 
obscure civil war to end in neighboring suriname 
they are bush negroes descendants of west african slaves who 
fled into the jungle after dutch colonists brought them across the 
atlantic hundreds of years ago to work the plantations 
from the late 1600s to the early 1800s thousands of slaves 
fought off the settlers destroying plantations freeing other 
slaves and vanishing into the vast tropical hinterland 
isolated like many indian tribes of the amazon region the bush 
negroes have their own language and culture 
for three centuries the bush afroamericans have been a nation 
within a nation arthur hailey author of roots wrote in the 
introduction to a history of the bush negroes they have remained 
independent and faithful to african traditions like no other group 
in the new world 
today they flee a threeyear war between surinames national 
army and the jungle commando a rebel group of about 200 whose 
leader ronny brunswijk is a bush negro from the mongo tapu village 
in eastern suriname 
most bush negroes come from thatched hut villages in eastern 
suriname where they exist by fishing hunting planting crops and 
gathering wild nuts and fruits 
they number about 65000 in six tribal nations the aukaner 
ndjuka saramaka paramaka matuari and kwinti 
since the fighting erupted in 1986 in suriname hundreds of bush 
negroes have been killed and many villages destroyed the military 
accuses bush negroes of being rebels or of aiding them 
more than 7000 bush negroes and hundreds of amerindians have 
crossed the maroni river to camps near st laurent in this french 
territory 
about 10000 others have fled to surinames capital paramaribo 
they tell similar stories of the army burning their villages and 
killing their children husbands and wives 
the military burned my village my hut with everything in it 
every day its bangbangbang said swanita the mother of seven 
children 
most bush negroes arent involved in the war and say they just 
want to live in peace 
although ronny brunswijk is one of them many bush negroes 
including his brother john are baffled by him 
i dont know what he wants he never told me said john 25 
who is chief of the ndjukas and came to the acarouany camp with his 
wife and two children 2 years ago but im not like him i dont 
like fighting 
ronny 27 is a cubantrained soldier who was the personal 
bodyguard of cmdr desi bouterse of surinames armed forces until 
being fired in 1986 
details of their falling out are unknown but the war is seen as 
a personal feud between brunswijk and the 42yearold bouterse 
after he was fired brunswijk is said to have taken arms and 
ammunition with him he robbed banks and gave the money to his 
people gaining the reputation of a robin hood but in june 1986 
bouterses army attacked brunswijks village and the jungle 
commando was born 
the refugees are shunned in french guiana a land of 80000 
people on the northern shoulder of south america in st laurent 
with a population of 7000 many blame them for a rise in drug 
trafficking robbery and murder 
the refugees live outside st laurent in four camps each run by 
about 20 french military police to leave even for a few hours they 
need permission and are transported on military trucks 
the refugees live in good conditions and have plenty of food 
and medical care said guido coosemans head of the united nations 
high commission for refugees office in st laurent but the 
problem is that the camps are more or less closed camps and there 
is no possibility of employment 
many view the bush negroes also known as maroons as primitive 
because of their isolated existence 
maroons are the people who have the most problems right now if 
they come to paramaribo they get the lowest paid jobs and live in 
the worst conditions said gloria leurs of the humanrights 
organization mooiwana 86 named after a surinamese village where at 
least 35 refugees were killed in an army raid nov 29 1986 
the french government is waiting to see if a peace agreement 
signed in early june between the government and brunswijk takes 
hold before repatriating the refugees to suriname 
the refugees are wary 
we dont believe the army wants peace said 27yearold 
nathaniel the granman or chief of the acarouany refugee camp 
which has 1428 refugees if we go back they will kill us

the dilemma for campaign finance reformers is 
that the only people who can write new rules are the players and 
they want to win 
republicans surely would be more tolerant of what they call the 
congressional incumbency protection system but for the fact that 
democrats hold the wide house majority the reelection rate which 
exceeded 98 percent last time helps perpetuate democratic control 
of the house 
proposals that seem fair and evenhanded almost invariably turn 
out to have side effects that work to the advantage of one party or 
the other 
president bush said he would be outraged at the suggestion that 
his campaign finance proposals to congress were intended to help 
republicans but democratic leaders said that is exactly what the 
administration proposals would do 
with democrats controlling both the house and the senate the 
bush package stands no realistic chance of enactment but it does 
provide a starting point for debate and perhaps compromise 
legislation on a subject that was not on the agenda at ronald 
reagans white house 
there are a variety of reform proposals before congress now a 
bipartisan house group is trying to draft a plan both parties can 
accept 
a halfdozen senate democrats have proposed a constitutional 
amendment to let congress impose ceilings on campaign expenditures 
a step the supreme court has held would infringe on free speech 
campaign scholar larry j sabato of the university of virginia 
calls that an example of a bad reform idea that sounds good 
attractive on the surface but likely to tilt the system even more 
heavily in favor of congressional incumbents 
sabato notes that congress composed of 535 incumbents who are 
fervently convinced of the worthiness of their own reelections 
would write any spending ceilings he said that probably would work 
to the disadvantage of challengers who need major expenditures 
to catch up with such incumbent advantages as name recognition 
staff free mailings district offices and constituent services 
in a twentieth century fund study of campaign finance sabato 
suggests free broadcast time as a way to lower campaign costs he 
proposes eight hours per station per year the time to be controlled 
by the major parties but similar ideas have been discussed off and 
on for 50 years 
sabato concedes the odds against his proposal saying such plans 
always have been consigned to the junkyard of good ideas that were 
legislatively impractical 
nor are democratic calls for public financing of congressional 
campaigns likely to get anywhere in the face of strong republican 
opposition 
bush said public financing would erode participation in the 
political process i will not support kicking the citizen out of 
the political process by saying that a citizen cannot financially 
support the candidate of his or her choice he said 
presidential campaigns have been publicly financed since 1976 
bush and democratic nominee michael dukakis each got 461 million 
in federal money to run their 1988 campaigns 
to free our electoral system from the grip of special 
interests the bush campaign finance plan would eliminate 
political action committees sponsored by corporations unions and 
trade associations which means most of them pac contributions for 
the 1988 congressional elections went to democrats 986 million to 
607 million demonstrating their tilt toward incumbents 
bush also would limit contributions by independent political 
action committees to 2500 a candidate instead of 5000 his 
package also includes a 2fold increase in the amounts the national 
parties can give their house and senate candidates republicans have 
been stronger in national party fund raising the democratic 
national committee has launched a drive to strengthen its 
fundraising operations 
the president wants to sharply restrict use of the postagefree 
congressional mail privileges an incumbents advantage congress 
recently expanded 
he seeks a federal law to set guidelines for congressional 
redistricting due after the 1990 census so that legislatures cant 
draw the lines to benefit one political party over the other 
democrats have full legislative control in 28 states republicans in 
8 
thats why fairness is hard to define let alone legislate

the only hit of the fall television season 
predicted by the nations largest advertising agency is booker 
on the fox broadcasting co 
the fact that a fox show was selected but not one show from the 
three networks was listed as a hit says something about the 
changing face of television 
the 198990 networks schedule is cautious conservative and 
comfortable according to the report more shows than ever have been 
renewed there are fewer programs that might be considered 
troublesome and a heavy reliance on stars and programs that have 
worked well in the past 
the annual preview of the fall season by saatchi amp saatchi 
advertising however gives abcs chicken soup starring jackie 
mason a nine on a scale of 110 
other highlyrated network shows are nbcs nutt house cbs 
the famous teddy z and abcs family matters all eights 
the saatchi report cites dramatic shifts in the business of 
television itself competition from independents cable and vcrs 
and wonders if the economics of television can continue to support 
big events from miniseries to the olympics 
calling competition the major source of network pressures it 
said that during the writers strike last year viewers did not turn 
away from television instead they turned their dials to fox 
broadcasting and adsupported cable the report said 
fox improved its average ratings by almost 50 percent with some 
of the most talked about shows on television and is expanding its 
programming to monday nights in september 
booker a spinoff from foxs 21 jump street stars 
richard grieco as private investigator dennis booker the character 
was noted for his renegade street tactics and unconventional style 
on 21 jump street which has a large and loyal following of 
young people booker will open the sunday night schedule and 
21 jump street will open foxs new monday night programming 
chicken soup stars comedian jackie mason as a man forced to 
retire at 52 from his job as a pajama salesman who finds 
satisfaction helping innercity kids at a local community center it 
takes on an abies irish rose aspect with the jewish characters 
love affair with a gentile woman played by lynn redgrave 
the comedy follows roseanne on tuesday night which is a big 
ratings night for abc roseanne has consistently beaten nbcs 
the cosby show for first place in the nielsen ratings in recent 
months 
chicken soup could find itself in the same situation that a 
different world has enjoyed on nbc following the cosby show 
has placed a different world near the top of the ratings 
although the quality of the show doesnt merit it chicken soup 
lacks both humor and charm and the relationship between mason and 
redgrave fails to light a spark 
cbs the famous teddy z stars jon cryer as a mailroom clerk 
in a talent agency who suddenly becomes a hot agent the show was 
created by hugh wilson who also created wkrp in cincinnati and 
franks place 
nbcs nutt house reunites stars harvey korman and cloris 
leachman and comic creator mel brooks high anxiety in a zany 
comedy about a new york hotel thats fallen on hard times it 
follows night court on wednesday night 
abcs family matters following full house on fridays is a 
spinoff of perfect strangers hariette winslow the elevator 
operator gets her own show and family reginald veljohnson perhaps 
best known as the cop in die hard plays her police officer 
husband 
other possible successes listed in the report are three nbc 
shows hardball mancuso fbi and sister kate 
john ashton plays a 45yearold detective who pushes hard to stay 
ahead of his young partner in hardball on friday robert loggia 
is crusty cynical fbi agent nick mancuso in mancuso fbi a 
spinoff from the miniseries favorite son stephanie beacham 
late of abcs dynasty plays a hardnosed nun at a catholic home 
for children in sister kate 
the two shows given the least chance for success are cbs a 
peaceable kingdom a family drama starring lindsay wagner as the 
head of a zoo and foxs hidden video a contemporary version of 
candid camera the saatchi report said a peaceable kingdom 
faces tough competition from abcs growing pains and head of 
the class on wednesdays

elsewhere in television 
letters for the beast viewers for quality television is urging 
its members to write to cbs in support of beauty and the beast 
the show is not on the fall schedule although cbs has said it would 
return in the future it is difficult to believe cbs in light of 
last years franks place deceit said vqt director dorothy 
swanson viewers were lulled then they will not be again she 
suggested cbs may be waiting for the fuss to die down before quietly 
canceling the show as it did with franks place

in a movie world where studio bosses seem to 
change chairs as frequently as they do shirts one closeknit group 
of filmmakers has been prospering for 27 years they are the folks 
who bring the biennial adventures of james bond 
licence to kill a midsummer entry in the season of 
blockbusters boasts a veteran crew 
albert r cubby broccoli has produced or coproduced all 16 of 
the bond films richard maibaum has cowritten 13 desmond 
llewelleyn has played the gadget maker q in 14 peter lamont has 
been production designer for 14 john barry has scored 11 bond 
films though a conflict of assignments kept him from the new one 
michael kamen takes his place john glen has directed the last 
five 
in addition stunt coordinators special effects designers 
publicists stunt men and others have long served the bond pictures 
michael wilson dates back to the 1964 goldfinger on which he 
was an assistant director for the fort knox sequence he has been 
with broccoli for 17 years first as assistant then executive 
producer 
in the recent films he has been coproducer and cowriter the 
new yorker formerly practiced international taxation law a good 
background for worldwide filming 
interviewed in his office at mgmua he was asked about the 
peculiar to americans spelling of licence to kill 
there was some discussion over whether we should spell it as 
american usually do though the dictionary lists both license 
which comes first and licence he said in england the noun 
is always spelled licence and the verb is license we decided 
since we had a british subject and a british agent and ian fleming 
had written it that way as a title we would adopt that spelling 
only the title is flemings the plot was devised by the 
filmmakers because all of flemings plots have been used up 
starting with dr no in 1962 the first five bond films were 
released annually now they come every other year and that allows 
for a more sensible pace 
from the start the bond movies were unbeatable at the box office 
with their winning combination of violence mystery exotic locales 
sex sophistication hightech toys and almost campy humor 
the bond movies also made credit and precredit sequences 
memorable bits to watch in from russia with love for example 
a man presumably with bonds face is chased and killed the titles 
then emerge on the undulating body of a belly dancer 
licence to kill began two years ago with a trip to china in 
search of locales wilson and maibaum tried a couple of stories 
based in china but they didnt work out 
the two writers decided to follow the headlines and spin a yarn 
about a notorious drug dealer who controls a latin american country 
the scripting period took about eight months 
normally we begin our preproduction in february said 
wilson we started filming in mexico in midjuly and we finished 
around thanksgiving time we go into postproduction until around 
easter then we have the film ready for july release 
unlike previous bond movies that have spanned continents 
licence to kill was shot in mexico and key west fla the 
company filmed interiors at mexico citys churubusco studio street 
scenes of isthmus city in and around the capital and seaside 
locations at acapulco a second unit worked at mexicali in baja for 
14 weeks to stage a spectacular chase of tanker trucks the climax 
of the film 
despite the heavy logistics wilson reported that the cost of 
licence to kill was 30 million to 35 million this he said 
was about average for a big production these days 
timothy dalton seems more comfortable in the new film than he did 
in his first bond outing the living daylights wilson agreed 
what happened was that when we first cast dalton in living 
daylights we had already written the script he came in very late 
and we had already written sort of a generic bond dalton played it 
in his style after working with him on one film it was quite 
obvious that he could not or should not imitate the roger moore 
style 
dalton brings something different he said this was an 
opportunity for us to write a different direction for bond using 
timothys personality as a catalyst four actors have played james 
bond sean connery george lazenby moore dalton and each has 
brought a new approach to the character thats what keeps the 
series contemporary and intersting 
the producer would not reveal the contractual arrangements with 
dalton but he indicated that both the producers and cast would like 
to see the association continue 
and the next adventure for bond 
well wait for this one to get out take a little rest then 
start all over again

after 16 years of authoritarian military 
rule chileans are getting instruction on how to live in democracy 
and preserve it after a civilian government takes over in march 
we are convinced that democracy can only survive in chile and 
latin america if all citizens take good care of it said monica 
jimenez director of a 350000 nonpartisan educational project 
called participate citizens must understand that democracy is not 
only a government system but also a lifestyle 
from that principle comes participates motto democracy 
everybodys responsability 
financing for the project was provided by the costa ricabased 
interamerican institute for human rights 
mrs jimenez a university professor and social worker directed 
a similar program last year called crusade for citizen 
participation which won her an award from the national endowment 
for democracy in washington dc 
that crusade mobilized 200000 volunteers across the country in a 
doortodoor campaign to promote voter registration for octobers 
referendum in which voters rejected a military proposal to extend 
until 1997 the presidency of gen augusto pinochet who took power 
in a 1973 coup 
the referendum obliged pinochet to call an open presidential 
election which will be held dec 14 pinochet is due to hand over 
power to the winner march 11 
it will be chiles first civilian government since the coup and 
mrs jimenez says chileans especially younger ones must be helped 
to face their new life under democracy and most of all to 
preserve it 
chile and latin america have gone through longlasting military 
dictatorships which created an atmosphere of confrontation within 
our societies she said in an interview 
we have been split among friends and enemies so we have now to 
create a new atmosphere where we all act as friends a society where 
we can have different opinions on many issues and still be able to 
sit around a table and talk and reach agreements 
in other words we have been able to realize that the other guy 
may also have part of truth 
mrs jimenez stressed that the program is completely 
nonpartisan 
we have some members of political parties working with us and 
we are also working with the catholic and other christian 
churches she said but they are all committed not to let their 
political or regligious beliefs interfere 
participate has already trained 400 civic educators to 
conduct the program those educators have trained about 3000 aids 
to work with them 
their job is to lecture a wide variety of groups in our 
society mrs jimenez said 
reaction has so far been very good requests for our lecturers 
are piling up from labor unions religious groups neighbors and 
housewives organizations sports and social clubs 
the workers are all volunteers and are picked mostly from among 
university students and young professionals 
mrs jimenez said a preliminary evaluation indicates that 
participates message is getting through 
i think people realize that you often understand the value of 
things once you lose them she said we lost democracy and we 
now understand how valuable it was 
we are making clear to them that once democracy is back its 
their responsibility to care of it and they are certainly 
understaing that 
mrs jimenez said the pinochet governments reaction has also 
been positive 
i see a general atmopshere of a better understanding now than 
the one we met last year last year a program such as our crusade 
was immediately seen as an antigovernment action not anymore

what lies in store for americans when a dozen 
west european nations open up their trading doors in 1992 us 
businessmen cant be totally certain but many of them see 
opportunity this is one of a series of occasional reports on what 
is in store in western europe when traditional trade barriers are 
removed

american businesses are rushing to open 
factories snap up companies and sell their products to take 
advantage of the giant consumer market that will be formed in 
western europe in 1992 
us corporate executives are plotting strategy for the single 
market that will be created when the dozen nations of the european 
economic community get rid of the many trade barriers separating 
them 
it is no more business as usual advises data resources inc 
a massachusettsbased consulting firm 
businesses agree 
1992 will happen said william gibson president of digital 
microwave corp a san jose calif company europe will look 
very much like the united states 
the opportunities here are very great said chris chaney 
sitting in the justopened european office of multiflow a 
computermaker based in branford conn 
the date 1992 has become the catchword for the move by the eec 
trading bloc to allow the free movement of people money goods and 
services among the 12 member nations its deadline for creating the 
single europeanwide market is dec 31 1992 
carla hills the us trade representative told congress in 
washington recently no other market is as important for american 
exporters or our investors as is the market of the european 
community 
the eec also known as the common market was the united states 
largest trading partner last year 
american companies of all sizes and in a variety of fields 
want to get into the market under the deadline 
1992 is now and companies need to get a toehold in the 
european market said paul sher director of eec affairs for hill 
and knowlton the us public relations firm 
alfred kingon the former us ambassador to the community said 
one option nobody has is to wait until 1992 to see what shape the 
market is going to be they have to do their thinking now 
paul provost director of eec public affairs for the american 
telephone amp telegraph co said companies are investing money 
hiring employees and setting up research and development facilities 
some worry the community will set up barriers denying outsiders 
access to its 320 million people 
there is a fear that advocates of a europefortheeuropeans 
approach may succeed in delaying or taking charge of key elements of 
the 1992 agenda said james robinson chairman of american express 
that could lead to discrimination against companies of 
noneuropean parentage he said in a speech in brussels 
a recent us commerce department report said american companies 
should benefit from the single market but it cautioned a danger 
exists if the program is put into effect in a less than open 
fashion 
californias digital microwave which makes high performance 
shorthaul transmission products doesnt want to be excluded 
our intent is to become a european supplier said gibson 
last year the company opened a hightech factory in scotland 
the fear of fortress europe was much stronger last year but 
the eec has tried to calm anxieties that it will throw up 
protectionist barriers to keep others out 
the whole fortress europe concern has cooled off said 
eamonn bates eec affairs manager for the american chamber of 
commerce in brussels 
people have got more informed and now know a lot more about 
1992 they realize its not all bad news 
in a key move the community backed off a proposal that appeared 
to discriminate against foreign banks and financial institutions 
which do billions of dollars worth of business in europe 
bates said us businesses were encouraged that things can be 
worked out if you deal with community officials properly 
the latest red flags have been hoisted over the communitys plans 
for regulating tv programming industrial standards and government 
purchases in the fields of telecommunications water energy and 
transportation 
mrs hills has complained about the move to require that a 
majority of entertainment programs shown on european tv be made in 
europe she said it would almost certainly have a disastrous 
effect on the american industrys earnings in europe 
the united states has also objected to a plan to let governments 
reject bids for telecommunications products if more than half the 
components were made outside the community such local content 
provisions also have surfaced in purchasing proposals for energy 
water and transportation 
but big multinational companies with long histories in europe say 
theyre ready 
since the 1950s international business machines corp has 
maintained a paneuropean manufacturing approach 
it made business sense to treat europe as an entity said ibm 
spokesman john wells in paris 
ibm has a dozen manufacturing plants in the eec countries more 
than 90 percent of the products it sells in europe are made in 
europe 
other companies are strengthening their positions 
in 1986 american companies completed 89 mergers and 
acquisitions worth 14 billion in the trading bloc according to 
martin sikora editor of the philadelphiabased magazine mergers amp 
acquisitions 
the number of deals rose to 107 valued at 24 billion in 1987 
and amounted to 82 worth 21 billion last year most were in 
food pharmaceuticals industrial equipment and electronics and 
computers 
it allows larger stronger more aggressive companies to play 
in this vast market sikora said 
whirlpool corp appeared to gain a firm base in europe after 
agreeing last year to form a joint venture with the major domestic 
appliances division of philips the dutch electronics giant 
atampt and philips set up a telecommunications partnership in the 
early 1980s and atampt linked up last june with italtel the italian 
telecommunications equipment maker and stet the stateholding 
company that is italtels parent 
many americans see a chance to boost their sales in the new 
market which is expected to force european companies to improve 
their operations and become more competitive 
compaq computer a big maker of personal computers for european 
businesses sees an even greater demand in the single market 
companies are doing everything they can to position 
themselves said james darezzo marketing vice president for 
compaqs international office in munich germany were reaping 
that benefit 
to meet increased demand the houstonbased company plans to 
double the size of its manufacturing plant in scotland 
stonhard maker of epoxy industrial floors wants to take 
advantage of europeans increasing need for better factories said 
james baldino managing director of the companys european 
operations 
the company based in maple shade nj opened the brussels 
office in 1987 to expand its business and later got caught up in the 
1992 push 
for us the timing could not be better said baldino

editors note the united mine workers of america once known 
for its brawling ways to settle coal strikes is on the picket line 
once again under new leadership it is using a new tactic 
nonviolence in west virginia oldtimers wonder whether the peace 
will last 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
curled wood shavings litter the bare dirt 
under the awning over the picnic table the shavings are the residue 
of whittling and sweeten the mountain air with an aroma of cedar 
horseshoe pits are handy a basketball hoop occupies a nearby 
utility pole juryrigged wires from the same pole send juice to a 
makeshift shack containing a card table coffee maker electric fan 
icebox four rentolets are convenient the sounds are of bird song 
and a rushing stream the slab fork of rum creek 
are west virginias coal miners on a summer outing 
hey were in a fight not on a picnic said bethel purkey 
and its one hell of a fight but yeah he said nodding 
times have changed 
we are now doing nonviolent civil disobedience some of our 
brothers and sisters have a hard time getting hold of that but its 
working 
this strike is going to be a new beginning for us or an end 
but i dont see an end i see us winning with this tactic and coming 
back as strong or stronger than we ever were 
purkey is president of local 5815 of the united mine workers of 
america 
he is 40 a big man with thick freckled arms and a bristling red 
beard he admits to having been in his share of brawls as had his 
father who was a miner and his grandfather who died in a cavein 
but purkey represents a new generation of leadership on the picket 
line that is putting a new face on the umw one of the nations 
rowdiest unions 
and he is right here in the coal fields of appalachia through 
two months and more of the biggest mine labor dispute in years 
times have certainly changed 
time was and not long ago when a west virginia picket shack 
such as the one at slab fork would have been littered not with 
perfumed cedar shavings but with spent cartridge shells and the 
smell of gunpowder 
the way they used to stop a truck in the old days purkey 
recalls was to turn it over and haul the driver out and give him 
a good thumping ive seen people shot at ours and theirs and 
people thrown in the river ours and theirs 
now we just stand there and ask the driver to honor our picket 
line if he says no we stand there anyhow or sit down the trucks 
have been turning around 
we dont allow any alcohol on the picket line we dont allow 
anybody we dont know we have a captain on every shift at six 
sites 24 hours a day 
everything is under tight control and discipline its working 
i dont know how long it will keep working because you can push a 
man only so far and we have been sorely provoked but for now its 
working 
purkey and others on the picket line say their new style of 
conducting a strike has percolated down from the union president 
richard trumka who they say has brought them a sense of pride and 
dignity not felt since the glory days of union founder john l lewis 
we have a smart man at the head of this organization purkey 
says i have faith in him all of us do 
purkey along with 350 miners in west virginia and 1250 in 
virginia have been on strike since april 5 against the pittston 
coal groups operations in both states they went out after working 
14 months without a contract another 300 kentucky miners joined 
them in june and that strike touched off sympathy walkouts 
involving 43000 miners in 10 states in appalachia and the midwest 
fellow coal miners werent the only ones however drawn to the 
umw cause 
your commitment to nonviolence and the use of passive civil 
disobedience has captured the attention of organized labor said 
cesar chavez the west coast farm workers leader at a recent rally 
in virginia as long as the miners continue their nonviolent ways 
chavez predicted the public would be on the umw side 
public support as well as economic pressure clearly is the umw 
strategy at that same rally umw vice president cecil roberts 
declared weve got the whole country on our side now we are 
winning this strike 
that remains to be seen a more immediate question facing both 
the miners and the coal industry is whether the current wave of 
union support represents a newfound solidarity or the last gasp of 
big labor 
back in the 1940s under john l lewis the union could call 
500000 members out of the mines and bring the entire industry to 
its knees after lewis retired in 1961 the union began a 20year 
downhill slide 
lewis successor tony boyle was sent to prison for ordering the 
murder of a union rival as well as his wife and daughter boyles 
successor arnold miller watched a proliferation of wildcat strikes 
splinter the union and hamper recruitment in the anthracite fields 
opening in western states his successor sam church lost 
rankandfile respect by giving back a number of hardwon benefits 
one after a strike of 111 days another of 72 days 
for a long time said purkey our people didnt really see 
anybody up there they had much confidence in until trumka came 
along

when trumka was elected in 1982 by a 2to1 margin over church 
he became the fourth president in 10 years of a union once known for 
its stability by then the umw was down to 65000 dispirited members 
mining only 45 percent of americas coal the rest mined by 
nonunion workers the umw the nations seminal industrial union 
and once its wealthiest was operating 400000amonth in the red 
a 40yearold lawyer and thirdgeneration miner trumka brought a 
fresh outlook and a new dynamic to the union he negotiated a 
contract in 1984 without an industrywide strike the first one in 20 
years he did it again in 1988 all the while building up a 100 
million strike fund 
he also won authority within the union to call selective 
strikes against specific companies such as pittston which withdrew 
from industrywide bargaining and refused to sign the 1988 contract 
richard trumkas ideas have won us two national agreements 
says purkey so you have to believe that his way is the way to go 
if that means nonviolent civil disobedience thats it 
we now have a small income while were striking 200 a week 
and health benefits the wildcat strikers dont get that just the 
selective strikers because our strike is authorized 
but every man has to show up on schedule and participate just 
like we were working we are better organized than in any strike 
ive been in and ive been in them all since i started in the mines 
in 1971 
were holding rallies and demonstrations and marches a 
completely different strategy and it takes some getting used to 
some thought the old ways were better but now we all see that this 
is better 
apparently the nonviolent philosophy takes some getting used to 
by others than the strikers 
at a recent court hearing in logan the district court judge 
eric obriant made reference to the mine workers highly 
sophisticated effort to peacefully prohibit trucks from driving up 
pittstons mine road at slab fork 
the pittston lawyer replied admittedly peaceful albeit no 
less disruptive 
in west virginias coal fields there is something almost quaint 
about words such as peaceful and sophisticated especially 
in logan county where in recent memory strike tactics have been 
about as sophisticated as a stick of dynamite 
you have to remember our history says low coal chapman 
this is where the hardest of the hard times began 
chapman explains that his parents named him robert but if you 
ask for me by that name nobody will know who youre talking about 
just ask for low coal 
it is a miners term for a thin seam of coal maybe 40 inches 
thick where it takes unusual stooping and bending and crawling to 
dig it out low coal chapman stands about 55 
he was referring to an episode at nearby blair mountain in 1921 
when company detectives sheriffs deputies and federal troops 
opened fire on miners marching down from charleston to organize the 
union in logan county twentyfour were killed 
chapman on strike at age 50 often hikes up the dirt road to the 
top of blair mountain to reinforce his resolve the view is 
pulsequickening and serene offering no hint of the turmoil and 
tension below 
the men didnt make it over the mountain but their spirit 
did says chapman were the children of that vision i want 
that dirt road to be named the road to solidarity 
chapman was born and raised on buffalo creek on the other side 
of a mountain from slab fork buffalo creek was where in 1972 a 
faulty dam burst and wiped out the entire hollow the torrent left 
124 dead and 4000 homeless chapmans parents two sisters and 
brother and their families were among the 4000 
nobody has forgotten he says that it was a pittston dam 
that broke 
low coal is right about that says bethel purkey we have a 
lot to resent about pittston them and their security guards 
theyre trying to provoke us into doing something that will land us 
in jail 
the security guards a private firm watch over the pickets 
continually filming them with movie cameras pittston says however 
that the purpose is not to intimidate 
at first the miners took the filming in good humor one posed for 
the camera in a groucho marx getup others barked and cavorted like 
puppies lately however it seems to have become less of a jokin 
matter 
theyve followed me home filmed my house purkey claims 
they even filmed our ladies auxiliary at a meeting at the school 
whats that got to do with the strike 
attempts to reach pittston spokesmen for comment in west virginia 
and at the company headquarters in greenwich conn were not 
successful repeated telephone calls were not returned 
there have been times buddy when youre tempted to be 
violent said one of the pickets at slab fork dave thompson 
whittling a stick listening in the silence for the sound of an 
approaching truck sometimes its hard to keep yourself in 
control 
were determined to see this through with nonviolence 
purkey says but like i say you can only push a man so far 
you keep twisting the screw twisting twisting at some point 
that banjo string will break

editors note environmental groups are offering adoption 
plans for wild birds and animals their habitats and open spaces as 
a way to raise money now that charitable donations are no longer 
taxdeductible its a gimmick a hook because everybody is

donna castles fourthgraders in milford pa have adopted an 
injured redtailed hawk named the red baroness nineyearold 
stephen raba thinks of the hawk as his own 
he talks about it all the time about his bird he takes it 
personally says his mother lynne raba when some of the class 
went to see it he was adamant that he had to go that it was so 
important its something that he takes a lot of pride in 
the students at dingman delaware elementary school recycled 25 
worth of aluminum cans to adopt the bird for one month at a nearby 
rehabiltation center for injured and orphaned birds of prey the 
children are hoping they can keep the red baroness on the mend until 
shes ready to be released into the wild 
elsewhere financial foster parents are being sought for a 
manatee in florida baby puffins off the coast of maine and 
california gray whales in the pacific ocean a pennsylvania trout 
stream can be adopted for an investment of labor as can a texas 
beach and an arkansas highway 
across the nation environmental groups are offering adoption 
plans for wild birds and animals their habitats and open spaces as 
a way to raise money anywhere nature is in trouble the groups say 
more and more people are adopting the wild through contributions 
its handson its strong and its powerful says pat noonan 
of the conservation fund in washington dc 
the environmental movement is trying to reach out in creative 
ways to enlist volunteer support and involvement and adoptatree 
and adoptawhale are things people can identify with 
jennifer bates of the whale center in oakland calif one of 
several organizations offering whales for adoption says its a 
gimmick a hook because everybody is hurting everybody needs 
money after you donate to a couple organizations chances are your 
mailbox is going to be inundated so you want to be the one piece of 
mail folks will not throw out 
zoos and aviaries often sponsor adoption programs for both 
special projects and general upkeep says charles wickenhauser of 
the pittsburgh zoo which recently raised 6500 to build a new 
penguin exhibit through a penguin parents program 
i think the generation of baby boomers has less of a giving 
tradition than our parents did he says were trying to find 
the trigger for their giving and trying to find it in 
nontraditional ways what unlocks the purse 
adoption rates range from 10 to hundreds of dollars the money 
is used either directly to buy housing medical care and food for 
the adoptee or indirectly to subsidize research species 
preservation educational programs or lobby efforts 
in exchange foster parents usually receive a glossy photograph 
and description of their animal occasional updates about its 
comings and goings and just like cabbage patch dolls a certificate 
of adoption 
but adoptions dont work for all environmental causes 
you have to have something thats there and identifiable that 
you can photograph and put a name on says craig van note of 
monitor consortium of conservation and animal welfare organizations 
in washington dc 
theres no way you can really adopt an elephant in africa in a 
case like that youd have to tell the people their elephant got 
killed last week and that would be a downer 
a florida native debra brown 33 of orlando was accustomed to 
seeing manatees swimming in the states shallow rivers 
but it wasnt until she received an appeal to adopt boomer 
that she became passionately involved in saving the gentle and 
fragile animals most of whom bear scars from boat propellers 
if something happened to boomer youd probably find me in 
tears she says as big and quote ugly as manatees are 
theyre beautiful 
since the save the manatee club of maitland fla began offering 
adoptions in 1984 officials say membership has grown from 800 to 
20000 adults and about 60000 students 80000 foster parents in 
all trying to save a species whose population has dwindled to about 
1200

boomer is a manatee whos special to a lot of people now and if 
something happens to boomer there are a lot of people who are going 
to be upset says club director judith delaney vallee its now 
their manatee 
adoptions have become the lifeblood of many organizations which 
have been scrambling for funds since charitable donations were 
declared no longer taxdeductible 
thanks to whale adoptions the massachusettsbased international 
wildlife coalition which monitors several endangered species has 
grown from three employees in 1983 to 22 now in the past year the 
group sent out 86000 humpback whale adoptions for 15 each 50000 
of which were christmas gifts 
our files grow faster than we can keep up with says 
coalition official margaret king people will send it as a gift to 
someone else its a great stocking stuffer and it crosses all 
barriers and countries we have people in saudi arabia france 
australia who have adopted whales 
sixtysix humpback whales that migrate yearly to the cape cod 
area can be adopted individual whales are identified by unique 
white and gray marks on their tails so foster parents receive a 
photograph of their whales tail as it breaches the water 
we really get cute letters from kids wanting to know if the 
whale will fit in their bathtub or do they have to build a pool 
king says 
schoolchildren are a lucrative market for environmental 
adoptions and many organizations gear their updates to children 
who not only learn about different species of birds and animals but 
also environmental sensitivity 
its a huge market says the whale centers bates kids 
have done some ingenious fundraisers one school took out a loan 
from a bank bought a large quantity of birdseed repackaged it and 
sold it to pay off the loan and adopt a whale with the proceeds 
in ms castles class stephen says he doesnt know how long 
classmates will be able to scrounge up enough cans to keep their 
hawk whose wing was maimed by an errant bullet and is being cared 
for at a nearby nature center but stephen says he knows why theyre 
doing it 
so we can protect it and make the wing heal he quickly 
responds it wouldnt be right if someone shot you 
stephanie streeter who runs the delaware valley raptor center 
where the hawk is housed says the center couldnt make it without 
its foster parents 
whats really nice is they can see what their money has 
accomplished she says they can see the bird it isnt a scam 
it isnt going to some fat cat sitting in a penthouse 
for those who have more time than cash however there are 
adoption programs eager to capitalize on sweat equity 
on their 50th wedding anniversary last september gregory and 
novaes gregg of clear lake texas picked up the garbage on their 
adopted mile of beach on padre island as part of the states 
biannual beach cleanup 
america was beautiful when we got married and here we are 50 
years later just trying to keep it that way says mrs gregg 70 
within six months after the texas general land office began the 
program in 1986 all 172 miles of accessible beach in the state were 
adopted by 30000 weekend warriors who have picked up 1055 tons 
of garbage says official jeff long 
our cleanup program is like a virus its very infectious he 
says some 25 states are now doing beach cleanups of some sort 
and many of those are modeled after our program 
the programs real punch has been in determining the source of 
the garbage each piece of trash is cataloged by volunteers and 
that information has been used to enact legislation to stop the 
polluters 
most beaches are adopted by social and civic clubs or companies 
and business groups but the greggs and their daughter and 
soninlaw adopted a mile on their own and when the four get 
together about once a month they head to the beach with their trash 
bags and check list 
i dont think you have to be deeply motivated it just takes a 
little sense of responsibility when you do something like this the 
end result is you yourself personally feel good says gregg 74 
were not going to see a brandnew world but were going to 
try to help it if we can

editors note nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide staten 
island is 2 times the size of manhattan yet it is the smallest of 
new york citys five boroughs in population with 400000 mostly 
white middleclass residents now with new york city reorganizing 
its government to conform to the oneperson onevote rule the cry 
for secession has risen once again on the island 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
across new york harbor from manhattans elegant 
towers the turnaround point on a famous 25cent ferry ride staten 
island is often derided as the worlds largest garbage dump 
be that as it may many of the 400000 residents of new york 
citys smallest borough want to cut ties with gothams government 
figuring theirs is by far the better place to live 
secession improbable say some impossible others argue 
inevitable say a few diehards 
a renewed secessionist movement was prompted by a us supreme 
court ruling in march that declared the citys board of estimate 
which awards lucrative franchises contracts and landdevelopment 
projects unconstitutional under the oneperson onevote rule 
on the board the borough president of staten island carries the 
same vote as his brooklyn counterpart although brooklyns 
population at 22 million is five times as large 
the court ordered new york to create a new form of government 
one that will likely eliminate the board of estimate and emasculate 
the offices of the citys five borough presidents 
those outside staten island and some who live there dont take 
talk of secession seriously and as a result island residents and 
local politicians find themselves the brunt of some more than gentle 
ribbing these days 
borough president ralph lamberti has been referred to at city 
hearings on the matter as the new george washington 
city councilman jerome odonovan says hes tired of council 
colleagues calling him alderman 
and local secession activist dan singletary says hes even been 
kidded by his daughter who lives in detroit she saw a story in a 
local newspaper called up and said dad the worlds largest 
garbage dump wants to secede 
to many staten island and garbage are synonymous thanks to the 
fresh kills landfill a sprawling 2000 acre 3squaremile garbage 
dump which is already 20 stories high at its tallest point and 
growing 
yes we are the largest garbage dump in the world but maybe we 
want to be more than that says singletary a transplanted 
chicagoan and artist who became active in community affairs during 
his 20 years on the island 
to those who live there staten island with its treelined 
streets green hills and wetland and wildlife sanctuaries is the 
last refuge from the concrete and condominiums of the rest of the 
city 
nearly 14 miles long and 7 miles wide it is 2 times the size of 
manhattan also an island its residents are 90 percent white 
middle and uppermiddle class workers many of whom fled from 
deteriorating brooklyn neighborhoods after the verrazanonarrows 
bridge opened in 1964 the only roadway linking staten island to the 
rest of the city 
we are not manhattanstyle people says les trautmann editor 
of the daily staten island advance which has a circulation of about 
90000 we tend to be more family oriented 
that smalltown feeling is reflected in the newspaper which 
trautmann says without embarrassment does the chicken dinner 
stuff lists bridge club results and has a frontpage column 
devoted to good news 
everyone here talks about going into the city as if they 
werent really a part of it says trautmann who describes himself 
as a homegrown staten islander 
up until a few years ago we even had people out in tottenville 
an area of the island who had never been to manhattan or any 
other part of the city its just a different type of place 
most tourists know the borough only as the turnaround point of 
the staten island ferry ride a bargain excursion good for viewing 
lower manhattan skyscrapers and the statue of liberty 
but if tourists looked beyond the drab and dingy docks the 
american institute of architects guide says they would find hills 
as steep as san franciscos breathtaking views of new york harbor 
and victorian mansions 
the street where borough hall stands looks like main street 
usa its neighbors include a small stationery store country 
furniture shop luncheonette and whitesteepled church 
staten island also has miles of beaches although many are 
polluted parks and playgrounds galore 1000 acres of protected 
greenland and the citys only historic restoration area 
still staten island represents only 5 percent of the citys 
population of 7 million and new york harbor serves as a wide moat 
we have run into two kinds of people on staten island says 
singletary people who feel that the quality of life here has 
changed so drastically that they see no reason to stay part of the 
city 
and a larger group of people who feel new york city is the 
greatest city in the world and they dont want to leave unless it is 
absolutely necessary unfortunately that may be the case

initial proposals floated by the charter revision commission a 
special panel appointed by mayor edward i koch to revamp city 
government did not leave staten islanders smiling 
it recommended eliminating the board of estimate and expanding 
the city council the citys other main legislative body from 35 to 
60 members staten island currently has two representatives on the 
city council and would pick up only one new member under the 
expansion plan 
in addition the borough presidents office would largely be 
reduced to a ceremonial post community boards and local politicians 
would have virtually no say if the mayor wanted to put jails and 
homeless shelters in residential neighborhoods 
land development and city services have topped staten islands 
list of complaints since it joined the greater city of new york in 
1898 
transportation sewers water service and the everpresent odor 
emanating from the dump are the bane of staten islanders on parts 
of the island water pressure is so low that on some days residents 
with secondfloor bathrooms cannot flush toilets 
i would be for secession says richard mahler 30 a 
technical service manager in manhattan and a native staten islander 
the island has changed so drastically since i was a kid 
woods have been torn down condos and town houses are springing 
up all over traffic is a mess as for crime i dont even feel safe 
letting my kids run around in the front yard alone we didnt worry 
about those kinds of things when i was growing up 
mahler who is weighing a move to new jersey or upstate new york 
concedes that crime is a universal problem today and that island 
development after the bridge was inevitable but he says with 
secession at least we would have some control over how the 
islands changing 
agitation for secession is not a new phenomenon it flared in the 
late 1940s when residents battled city pols over the fresh kills 
landfill and lost 
whenever something goes against the grain of staten islanders 
someone yells lets secede says loring mcmillen a lifetime 
resident and official borough historian 
mcmillen 83 has lived through all of staten islands secession 
threats and thinks no more of this one than the others 
i think its a lot of wind he says succinctly i dont 
think well gain a bit by doing it 
the real question may be is it possible 
were not fooling ourselves that it wouldnt be a herculean 
task says kathryn rooney an attorney in the office of state sen 
john marchi who has been leading the battle for secession 
there are three ways staten island can secede through a charter 
change by petition a proposal by the charter revision commission or 
an act of legislature which must be approved by the governor 
the first two ways involves voters in all five boroughs and 
chances of that succeeding are nil says rooney 
secessionists placed their hopes on state lawmakers and on july 
1 the legislature voted to give staten islanders the right to vote 
on secession in november 1990 gov mario cuomo has not revealed 
whether he will sign the measure he has said he does not want 
staten island to leave the city but he also says provisions must be 
made to ensure the island has a strong voice in government 
beyond the political machinations of secession lies the question 
of economic feasibility can staten island which has virtually no 
industry exist on its own 
rooney who coauthored a 1983 report on the feasibility of 
secession says the answer is yes after paying current wages for 
services such as fire police and sanitation she says staten 
island would have a 17 million budget surplus 
she also dismisses critics who say property taxes would triple 
imagine what we could do if we were by ourselves not part of 
the city but so close to itwe could lower corporate taxes impose 
fewer restrictions and attract those businesses now leaving new york 
for new jersey the possibilities are endless 
ironically the gargantuan and muchhated garbage dump could be 
one of the islands biggest sources of income 
realistically wed have to continue the dump but theres also 
no reason we couldnt charge the city of new york dearly to dump 
their garbage here rooney says it could be a real revenue 
producer

editors note the portuguese descended of celtic roman and

globecircling empire that their famous explorers established five 
centuries ago now the country is trying to catch up with its 
european neighbors but there are some formidable economic obstacles 
to overcome

lisbon a charming but dilapidated 
coastal city of seven hills looks more like a teeming third world 
metropolis than the modern european capital it is 
there are the sloping terracotta roofs the palm trees the 
wellused park benches and ugly modern monuments shoeshine men work 
on the blackandwhite tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through 
honking fumespewing traffic the people look sturdy and not 
particularly fashionminded 
this scene underscores how far portugal perched on the 
southwestern fringe of europe has to go to achieve its goal of 
catching up with its neighbors now an overheating economy is 
further imperiling that ambition 
a surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small 
countrys ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992 
thats when the 12nation european community which portugal joined 
in 1986 becomes one barrierfree marketplace of 320 million 
consumers 
in the late 1980s portugal is belatedly turning its attention 
eastward to the rest of europe after hundreds of years of looking 
across the atlantic and into africa and india 
the 103 million portuguese descended of celtic roman and 
moorish conquerors perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the 
globecircling empire that their famous explorers discovered five 
centuries ago 
portugals colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed 
mingling of black brown and white faces in lisbons cafes in the 
curry in portuguese food in the easy command of english in this 
portuguesespeaking country 
after painful recession austerity and more than 25 percent 
inflation in 1983 and 1984 portugal is one of europes most dynamic 
economies gross domestic product has grown 45 percent a year on 
average for three years and is projected to continue at 35 
percent unemployment has been halved to nearly 6 percent 
a conscientious debtrepayer portugal has cut its foreign debt 
to 16 billion down from 804 percent of gdp in 1985 to 407 
percent 
but signs of economic overheating appeared last year forcing 
unpopular measures prime minister anibal cavaco silvas 
centerright social democrats who won an unprecedented majority in 
parliament in the june 1987 general election have lost support in 
recent months 
a poll recently published in o jornal showed that the social 
democrats down to 41 percent nearly halfway through their fouryear 
term from just under 50 percent in the election the cleancut 
49yearold prime minister has developed a reputation for being 
abrasive and overly selfconfident 
the opposition socialists meanwhile have gained to 36 percent 
from 223 percent and socialist president mario soares a 
legendary consummate politician has become increasingly popular 
nonetheless cavaco silva is still expected to be the first 
portuguese leader to survive a full fouryear term since the 1974 
revolution of the carnations which ended 48 years of authoritarian 
rule mostly under rightist dictator antonio salazar 
we are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient 
and competitive economy a more creative and enterprising society a 
freer more modern country without being perturbed by those who 
would like portugal to turn back to the past the prime minister 
said in a recent speech 
the most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers 
who are resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp 
processing fearing these will replace traditional olive trees and 
threaten farm jobs 
the eucalyptus war reached a climax in late march when local 
people trying to dig up newly planted trees in valpacos clashed with 
national guardsmen 
in lisbon there are plenty of complaints too 
jaime de lacerda director of the confederation of portuguese 
industry said now people tend to criticize the government a lot 
and the mood is a very critical one 
said economist jose cavalheira antunes of banco espirito santo 
i think we have a certain situation of crisis 
you hear it on the streets 
isaac da silva a 52yearold taxi driver said many people 
are unhappy because life isnt easy we have to work very hard the 
cost of living is very hard 
but not everybody is negative 
licelia godinho a 35yearold car rental worker said there 
are more jobs there is less poverty in particular than in the other 
days

inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 123 percent more than 
twice the governments 6 percent target for this year while the 
trade balance went into the red last year giving it a 59 billion 
gap 
strong consumption and investment are to blame recent political 
stability has unleashed long pentup demand 
to cool the economy the government in april instituted 11 
financial measures which raised interest rates now at nearly 15 
percent reduced banks liquidity and restricted the availability 
of credit particularly in the booming car sales market 
although some measures were widely regarded as necessary they 
were attacked as late and misdirected they have underscored the 
governments tendency to intervene while simultaneously championing 
freemarket policies 
again it is the private sector that is suffering said luis 
campos e cunha an economics professor at lisbons new university 
they should be thinking of squeezing public expenditure 
foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent 
policy changes and voluminous red tape taxes are complex and labor 
laws restrictive there are periodic public sector strikes 
nonetheless foreign investors seeking a foothold in the common 
market ahead of 1992 and attracted by portugals low wages invested 
496 million in the year ended october up significantly from 166 
million in 1986 
said nicholas racich administrator of manufacturers hanover 
trust cos portuguese operations you have to keep plugging 
away 
but the millions of dollars of ec financial aid that have flowed 
into portugal has proved a mixed blessing although it has enabled 
muchneeded improvements to transport and communications to begin 
ec demands for portuguese matching funds have worsened the budget 
deficit 
the government is implementing farreaching economic reforms 
including restructuring the capital markets 
the thirdtier lisbon and oporto stock exchanges not yet fully 
recovered from the stock market crash are being modernized and 
combined into a national bourse in late april the government 
launched an ambitious privatization program with the sale of a 49 
percent stake in unicer the stateowned brewer 
we want to create the confidence confidence on various levels 
not just in the market but also in the financial institutions 
said rui ambrosio tribolet the lisbon stock exchanges general 
secretary 
but another problem is that portugals progress is expected to 
widen social divisions 
said cavalheira antunes the idea of social solidarity is 
regressing and the idea of everyone for himself is coming out on 
top 
portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts 
at some 3700 its per capita gdp is europes lowest it has the 
worst literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates 
portugal imports 80 percent of its energy and surprisingly half 
its food even though onefifth of the population works in 
agriculture 
the country is extremely dependent on tourism each year 
portugals population more than doubles as tourists flock in mostly 
to the southern algarve coast 
other big industries tend to be traditional textiles footwear 
cork forestry products fishing wine and ceramics shipbuilding 
and repair and construction also are important 
the experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios 
if its lucky and smart portugal could become europes 
california by concentrating on exotic produce high technology 
light manufacturing and tourism 
if it isnt foreigners might buy up portugals choice assets 
leaving it flooded with imports and producing the lowtech 
lowprofit goods 
the portuguese who are mostly catholic conservative and family 
minded have a reputation for being resilient in adversity and 
flexible in the face of change 
in particular portugal prides itself on successfully absorbing 
some 700000 portuguese retornados and african immigrants who 
fled to the country in the mid1970s after portugal gave up its 
african colonies of angola mozambique and guineabissau 
optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederations 
lacerda who said i think we are not going to miss the 
opportunity of 1992

editors note its a sad summer in little falls ny once 
known as the smallest city in the united states with a class a pro 
baseball team alas the little falls mets moved to massachusetts 
this year and the new york village was left with a pictureperfect 
ballpark standing empty baseball in little falls was truly the only 
game in town 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lorrie keefe doesnt know what to do 
with herself this summer maybe ill take up jogging she 
chuckles 
lorrie keefe is a diehard baseball fan and shes not had much 
to chuckle about lately the outlook is bleak for baseball fans in 
this village tucked in the rolling hills of the mohawk valley a sad 
silence has fallen on the patrons of the game mighty casey has 
struck out 
the casey in question however isnt the mudville slugger from 
ernest thayers classic poem its michael casey who bought the 
little falls mets last year and when a better opportunity knocked 
decided to strike out for his hometown of pittsfield mass rather 
than have his team play here at veterans park a field of dreams if 
ever there was one 
michael casey does have one thing in common with the smug 
slugger keefe says his sense of timing its mighty rotten 
i didnt want to believe it at first says the 53yearold 
keefe who lives a couple of blocks from the ballpark and only 
missed a handful of home games in the 12 years the mets played here 
theres really nothing much to do in this town it was really 
quite a thrill having em here 
i hate to look at it rationally but when you spend that much 
money casey shelled out 230000 for an a team and being as we 
were noted as the smallest city in the whole united states as having 
a franchise i suppose i could see his point but he certainly 
didnt do it in a very good way he could have given us a chance to 
get another team in here 
despite losing money in his first season as an owner casey 
intended to stay in little falls for at least one more year 
however that quickly changed when the pittsfield cubs of the class 
aa eastern league decided to move last september 
we realized after the loss we experienced that we were going to 
be treating this as a business casey says sitting in his office 
at pittsfields wahconah park we knew and we were very upfront 
with the people over there that longterm we just couldnt see us 
staying in little falls because of the investment that was made 
we thought the cubs would be here but when it opened up we 
acted and we acted in a hurry 
that happened in middecember and little falls was left without 
a team at the worst possible time 
we thought at least if he stayed for the 89 season that would 
give us a chance to look says mayor michael izzo 
casey may not have given them that chance but his decision to 
move to pittsfield population 50000 appears to have been a 
prudent one businesswise 
despite its awful reputation wahconah park in the past games 
have had to be delayed because the sun sets directly behind center 
field and batters were unable to see the speeding ball is looking 
good these days its got a fresh paint job in the mets colors 
of course a new infield new scoreboard billboards galore and a 
screen in center field to block out the sunsets 
casey hopes to draw at least 50000 for the season which is 
crammed in from midjune to the end of august little falls drew 
just under 30000 to rank in the middle of the new yorkpenn league 
in attendance last season 
in one sense little falls is a victim of a notsopleasant trend 
in minorleague baseball 
it seems to be going toward the bigger cities says oneonta 
yankees owner sam nader whos been in the business for almost a 
halfcentury if were really saying that baseball is americas 
game better not forget the people in the provinces the days where 
the community people are involved seem to be going by the boards 
now were getting entrepreneurs and people who are in it for ego 
trips or whatever it makes it extremely difficult for the small 
community which has been the backbone of this great sport to 
survive

editors note unlike the european gentry of another century who 
put pinches of snuff to their noses to exact refreshing sneezes 
people who chew tobacco often suffer social snubs spitting in 
public however offensive may have been tolerated but not anymore 
who has seen a spittoon lately and that wad in a baseball players 
jaw is likely to be bubble gum

chewing tobacco is like picking the banjo 
they say around here a peculiarly american practice 
so while cigarette manufacturers are battling declining sales in 
the united states by opening new markets in asia and the third 
world the producers of smokeless tobacco still must look to the 
homefolks 
luther pittman executive vice president of operations for 
pinkerton tobacco co in owensboro concedes todays chewing tobacco 
market is a mature industry he should know he grew up on a 
tobacco farm in north carolina and has worked in the tobacco 
business for 41 years 
the only way were going to get a lot of growth will be getting 
business from our competition says pittman whose company for 
more than 100 years has been producing chewing tobacco with names 
like red man spark plug days work browns mule and a mans chew 
of course theyre trying to do the same thing 
thats not to say everybody has quit chewing and spitting 
despite the repeated warnings about the dangers of tobacco 
americans still poked more than 64 million pounds of looseleaf chew 
into their cheeks last year not counting the hard plugs of chewing 
tobacco 
production of all smokeless tobacco products which includes 
snuff declined from 1337 million pounds in 1985 to 1255 million 
pounds in 1986 and slipped another 32 percent in 1987 according 
to figures compiled by john maxwell of wheat first securities in 
richmond va 
one reason for chewing tobaccos decline maxwell says is its 
inconvenience and the way coworkers view spitting in public 
it goes ok on the playing field but it doesnt go over too 
well in the office he says 
but even that wad in the jaw of a baseball player these days is 
likely to be bubble gum and whos seen a spittoon in service lately 
pinkertons research indicates people who chew are mostly 
bluecollar males with use pretty well spread among people 25 to 55 
years of age pittman says 
we had always looked at our customers as being farmers 
construction people miners people who use both hands in 
working pittman says its easier for them to chew tobacco than 
it is to smoke 
but the market may be changing slightly recent company surveys 
show 20 percent of smokeless tobacco users have household incomes of 
more than 50000 he says 
the pinkerton tobacco co is a privately held subsidiary of the 
pinkerton group of richmond which is owned by swedish tobacco co 
in stockholm 
maxwells figures indicate pinkertons biggest competitor for 
looseleaf customers is conwood co lp based in memphis tenn 
which makes levi garrett 
levi garrett edged slightly ahead of red man in 1988 maxwell 
says selling 1795 million pounds to red mans 1775 million pounds 
regardless of who the competition is marketing is a big part of 
staying ahead pittman says 
the company advertised primarily on tv before the federal 
government banned such ads now it uses newspapers magazines and 
promotional events such as tractor pulls 
it makes about 500000 of the familiar red man caps a year for 
promotional purposes 
pinkerton employs 520 workers at its plant in western kentucky 
where it makes 14 brands of plug chewing tobacco seven brands of 
looseleaf and nine brands of pipe tobacco workers are not 
required to use tobacco but those who do are entitled to one free 
pinkerton product of their choice per day 
the fragrant smell of tobacco fills the packing room floor at the 
owensboro plant even ardent tobacco opponents probably would have 
to admit the place smells wonderful 
but while the fragrance is allowed to linger scraps are not as 
workers run machinery and oversee packing operations others sweep 
up loose pieces of tobacco 
people who come in here say theyre utterly amazed at how clean 
it is pittman says but were manufacturing a product people 
use orally weve got to keep it clean 
inside the factory a pouch of tobacco can be cut folded 
filled boxed and on a conveyor belt within three minutes the plant 
produces hundreds of thousands of pouches a day 
the companys 2000 wholesale customers order by telephone or fax 
machine and workers record the orders on a sophisticated computer 
system 
here are some other facts about the chewing tobacco business 
pinkerton which celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1987 moved 
its factory from toledo ohio to owensboro in 1973 
though pinkerton uses kentuckygrown tobacco in some products 
red man is made primarily from tobacco grown in wisconsin and 
pennsylvania with smaller amounts from connecticut 
north carolina leads in total volume of chewing tobacco 
consumed kentucky ranks eighth 
heading a company that makes tobacco products isnt a problem for 
pittman 
ive literally been in tobacco all my life he says 
i use all forms of tobacco the only answer i can give is im 
working in an industry that manufactures and sells a perfectly 
legitimate legal product supporting consumer demand 
tobacco has paid an awful lot of bills since the revolution and 
even before

nbcs hunter a detective drama starring 
fred dryer is a show that is reversing a television trend 
the usual course for a hit series is to reach a ratings plateau 
then slowly decline as the show becomes complacent and finally runs 
out of steam 
hunter which begins its sixth season in september turned 
that routine on its ear forget the first two years dryer says 
they dont count were going into our fourth season 
the show has been climbing in the ratings finishing in a tie for 
16th place this past season the stories have also gotten better and 
have more substance hunter has bounced about the schedule but 
seems to do best on saturday at 10 pm 
in the beginning the ratings were lackluster so were the 
stories the show was a blatant ripoff of clint eastwoods dirty 
harry film character 
dryer the 6foot6 former allpro defensive end for the los 
angeles rams even closely resembles eastwood hunter began as a 
swaggering unorthodox cop who carried a 357caliber magnum 
relentlessly pursued the bad guys and constantly fought with his 
superiors 
stepfanie kramer also stars as his partner sgt dee dee mccall 
an equally hardboiled detective who was nicknamed the brass 
cupcake 
weve evolved way out from that says dryer hes 
unorthodox today if its unorthodox to be compassionate to live 
your job and take it home with you i credit roy huggins with 
turning the show around during his time as executive producer he 
took a show that was making very small concentric circles and opened 
it up and set up guidelines to make it bigger and better with more 
emphasis on stories 
what i contributed was to take those stories and tell them 
through the characterizations of hunter and mccall the audience 
must see how we react how we feel about things the relationship 
between hunter and mccall is drastically important you must care 
about the people you are watching 
more changes are due in the fall dryer and his partner lawrence 
kubik will become executive producers 
youre going to see a lot of subtle changes in communications 
in quality control and in postproduction dryer says hunter 
and mccall are moving away from the station house to parker center 
itll give it a more contemporary hightech look were redesigning 
the set and were making it easier to film in the old set 
physically restricted where you could place the cameras 
well do fewer car chases fewer fistfights our stories will 
have more to do with decisionmaking by hunter and mccall theyll 
have more to do with the human condition where one truth can 
collide with another truth our scripts will be more accommodating 
to good roles for guest stars 
as a football player dryer believed in preparation he adheres 
to that same practice as an actor and producer 
the people paying you never see the preparation he says 
but thats the most important thing you do i sit in on all the 
story pitches and conferences i have good writers and i rely on 
their tastes and ideas but i help them structure the stories 
this is a collaborative medium and i enjoy that i want to hire 
people and let them do their job but they can only do that if 
everyone is clear on the vision were trying to accomplish its 
going to be my vision and my taste 
dryer has his own production company and is developing films but 
he doesnt expect to have time for them until hunter leaves the 
air he thinks the show will go at least another two years 
since starting hunter in 1984 dryer has made four guest 
appearances on cheers and went to israel in 1986 to star in the 
feature film death before dishonor 
dryer says first on his schedule after hunter is to build a 
new house with his own hands i have a lot of builders in my 
family he says my brother and i helped my father build his 
house if i wasnt in acting and producing id be in construction 
the great thing is i can do other things in life my life isnt 
defined by the fact that i do hunter or that i was a football 
player i want as many diversified experiences as i can have if im 
prepared for it it wont get by me

for six mondays last spring mandy patinkin stood 
on stage at the new york shakespeare festivals anspacher theater 
and sang his heart out 
accompanied by pianist paul ford patinkin went through an 
eclectic yet very personal collection of songs ranging from an al 
jolson medley to stephen sondheim numbers to a miniversion of 
rodgers and harts pal joey a musical he would like to do on 
broadway some day 
the soldout 90minute concerts proved to be among the hottest 
tickets in town now he has brought that solo show called mandy 
patinkin in concert dress casual to broadway for a fourweek run 
july 25aug 19 at the helen hayes theater 
the whole idea was to create something that i love to do so 
that im not wasting my life just waiting for other projects 
patinkin was saying the other day ive waited seven months to a 
year for something i wanted to do and i got tired you spend your 
lifetime on the telephone and reading scripts as opposed to 
creating something 
patinkin doesnt like to mark time hes an intense even 
dangerous performer willing to take risks in unusual projects even 
if it means falling on his face and he has most notably in the 
knife david hares critically panned musical about a man who 
undergoes a sexchange operation 
but he has gotten back up until now patinkin has been best 
known for his roles in broadway musicals like evita and sunday 
in the park with george or appearances in such movies as 
yentl and the princess bride 
he also is something of a perfectionist during his spring 
concerts he often stopped a number in midsong if he felt it wasnt 
being done correctly or when he bobbled a lyric 
much of the material in his oneman show comes from an album 
released earlier this year by cbs records the recording was made in 
consultation with ford and paul gemignani a veteran conductor of 
broadway musicals 
ford and gemignani fed the singer lists of songs nearly two 
dozen of which finally made it to the recording studio patinkin 
spent three or four months walking around the streets of manhattan 
learning songs 
i dont read any music says patinkin a selftaught singer 
who first started singing back in temple on chicagos south side at 
the age of 8 i sit down with paul ford and my little cassette 
recorder paul literally plunks out the notes with one finger in the 
exact time and i learn it then if i like the song and it stays 
with me i keep working on it 
among the numbers that finally were recorded were standards like 
over the rainbow and brother can you spare a dime as well 
as more obscure material such as coffee in a cardboard cup from 
the flop kander and ebb musical 70 girls 70 
patinkin found the actual recording of the album cathartic 
youre depressed or something you go into a room and sing a 
couple of songs and all of a sudden you feel better he says 
people associate singing with being happy and i think its true 
when i sing i feel better 
out of the record came the show born when joe papp head of the 
shakespeare festival offered him the anspacher patinkin was 
already performing there starring in shakespeares the winters 
tale six nights a week 
it was on his nights off that patinkin sang the money raised 
from the concerts went to the festivals free shakespeare in central 
park and broadway cares an aids support group 
people had a wonderful time patinkin says of the solo 
experience it was like being at home or in a studio you can 
improvise with just a piano player you can do things over again and 
try new things on the spot 
the broadway engagement follows a brief sojourn in california 
where patinkin played a small role in dick tracy the warren 
beatty movie about the famous comic strip detective in the film he 
appears as 88 keys piano player for breathless mahoney played by 
rock star madonna they get to sing several songs written for the 
movie by sondheim dick tracy is expected to be released next 
summer and patinkin has several other movie projects waiting 
but for now he will concentrate on his broadway show and possibly 
more concerts with orchestras around the country after that 
when i look back on those songs on the album and in the show 
they are all tales either about the past the present or the future 
and concern things i like or have worked on patinkin says 
in the case of sondheim many of them are reflections or 
lessons on how we should live our lives in the case of over the 
rainbow and other songs they are like dreams what we hope for 
they all spoke to me in a way they have to do with how i feel 
maybe thats why i like them

archaeological exploration in iraq has picked 
up since the ceasefire in the iraniraq war yielding rich finds 
from the era 2000 years ago when the powerful assyrian empire 
dominated the middle east 
the upsurge comes as president saddam husseins government seeks 
to bolster iraqs selfimage through excavation and rebuilding at 
sites like babylon that symbolize the nations historical greatness 
by appealing to history saddam encourages iraqis to view 
themselves as the heirs of a great civilization that flowered in 
ancient iraq while the surrounding world was lingering in 
prehistory a western diplomat said 
iraq includes much of the fertile crescent of ancient 
mesopotamia where early rulers developed efficient armies and 
sophisticated city administrations that rivalled the pharaohs egypt 
ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone 
sculptures archives of inscribed clay tablets delicate goldwork 
and ivory carvings illustrate the importance of early iraqi 
civilization 
to help build morale during the recent eightyear war with 
persian iran the iraqi government recalled assyrian and babylonian 
victories in the first millennium bc against the ancient persians 
portrayed as unscrupulous aggressors 
although the war was halted last august by a united 
nationsmediated ceasefire history is still being promoted 
underscoring saddams drive to boost iraqs role in the arab world 
in addition to the iraqi teams archaeologists from the united 
states britain poland west germany the netherlands and japan 
were digging around the country earlier this year most will resume 
work in the fall 
saddam also agreed in recent talks with american businessmen in 
baghdad iraqs capital that a selection of ancient iraqi treasures 
would tour the united states 
its clear theres more than scholarship involved in all this 
promotion of archaeology but the recent finds have been 
spectacular said a western archaeologist speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
new excavations at three sites in the assyrian heartland of 
northern iraq have unearthed a goldfilled royal tomb dating from 
the 8th century bc as well as imposing sculpture and 
architectural remains 
at nimrud the assyrian military capital 250 miles north of 
baghdad iraqi archaeologists found a stone chamber where two women 
were buried along with more than 55 pounds of gold jewelry 
muzahem mahmoud the excavation director said it was the 
richest assyrian burial known 
an inscription on stone in the tomb in wedgeshaped cuneiform 
writing identified the women as yabaya and taliya possibly the 
daughter and granddaughter of king sargon who ruled an empire that 
stretched from the persian gulf to the mediterranean 
the inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial 
chamber if anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave i 
pray to the gods of the nether world that his soul should roam in 
the scorching sun after death let the ghost of insomnia take 
hold of him for ever and ever 
the gold jewelry included diadems necklaces belts bracelets 
and anklets and 50 pairs of earrings as well as a bronze mirror 
with an enamel handle encrusted in precious stones 
at ninevah the assyrians administrative capital another iraqi 
team unearthed a stone door carved with four lions that was part of 
the citys fortifications in its last days 
they also found arrowheads and skeletons of assyrian warriors who 
may have died during a siege by the babylonians and medes ninevah 
fell in 612 bc after holding out for two months and was destroyed 
outside the ruins the archaeologists found remnants of an 
irrigation system built by king sennacherib a century earlier to 
increase vegetation around the city as well as a stone terrace 
where he constructed what the tablets call a palace without 
rival 
farther north near the border with syria british archaeologists 
tentatively identified a 100foot high mound as the remains of 
ancient tillule another important military and religious center 
the team found the base of a ziggurat a temple shaped like a 
stepped pyramid that may have belonged to a shrine for the assyrian 
weather god adad 
they also located sections of two roads believed to be part of 
highways linking ninevah with syria and turkey 
everything here tells us that this is a major settlement 
said excavation director warwick ball of the british museum its 
only a matter of time before we find the clues to tell us that tel 
alhawa is the modern name of tillule 
he said the assyrians used tillule as a center for massing troops 
before launching campaigns against syria palestine and egypt 
at babylon whose kings succeeded the assyrians as rulers of 
mesopotamia a major project is underway to excavate and restore the 
whole ninesquaremile area of the ancient city 
the multimilliondollar restoration will include the palace of 
king nebuchadnezzar the 6th century bc king who built the 
legendary hanging gardens of babylon one of the seven wonders of 
the world

thousands of ancient treasures have been 
looted from churches and tombs in the turkishheld north of cyprus 
and authorities there say they cant stop a booming trade in stolen 
antiquities 
plundered icons portraits of byzantine saints are smuggled 
out and offered for sale on west european art markets along with 
3000yearold vases and delicate frescoes stripped from medieval 
churches 
villagers wanting to make some money bring in an icon or pots 
they dug out of tombs said an antiques dealer in northern cyprus 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
there are regular buyers local and foreign who get the stuff 
abroad one way or another 
cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the turkish army invaded 
and seized the northern onethird of the mediterranean island 
following an athensbacked coup aimed at uniting cyprus with greece 
the predominantly moslem turkish cypriots unilaterally declared 
independence in 1983 but their republic is recognized only by 
turkey 
after some 200000 greek cypriots fled south disused churches 
were stripped of icons and other valuable furnishings some churches 
were converted into mosques and others were used as warehouses or 
stables 
the european parliament in december condemned what it called 
the continued destruction and pillaging of the christian and 
hellenic cultural heritage in northern cyprus and asked turkey 
to respect what is a profoundly european cultural heritage 
greek cypriot officials claim more than 7000 icons are missing 
as well as hundreds of ancient objects including some looted from 
private collections and others from storerooms of foreign 
archaeological missions 
officials in the north insist they dont have the facilities to 
prevent such thefts 
naturally were concerned but were a small state we dont 
have the funds to employ hundreds of guards to look after all the 
sites day and night education and culture undersecretary buhan 
tuna told the associated press 
we do try but the people who steal major items like the 
mosaics arent from the island theyre professionals from abroad 
turkish cypriot officials say they have about 4000 icons in 
storage awaiting display in a new museum and that they dont know of 
any others they say the private collections were catalogued and 
locked up 
but cypriot icons along with ancient vases and stone figurines 
are frequently offered for sale abroad 
turkish antiques also have disappeared among them a sword said 
to have belonged to the ottoman sultan selim ii whose troops 
conquered cyprus in 1570 it was reported stolen last year from the 
st sophia mosque a christian cathedral before the 16th century 
moslem conquests in the turkish sector of nicosia 
the greek cypriots have sometimes been able to retrieve stolen 
treasures 
experts at some foreign museums and auction houses have been 
very helpful said athanasios papageorghiou director of the 
cyprus governments archaeological service 
theyve notified us when cypriot pieces turn up and the 
government or a private foundation has been able to buy them 
but thats only a fraction of whats missing and more is being 
taken all the time 
papageorghiou said that earlier this year rare 12th century 
frescoes were removed from the church of agios filon in the north 
we shouldnt have to spend money to buy back our own 
property he added we cant afford to pay a huge ransom for 
something 
since greek cypriots cannot enter the turkish sector 
archaeological service officials rely on diplomats united nations 
officials and foreign scholars for information on whats 
disappearing 
however turkish cypriot authorities allowed a dutch member of 
the european parliament ymenus van der werff and a leading british 
byzantine expert robin cormack of londons courtauld institute of 
art to survey monuments and sites in the north in june 
the turkish cypriots follow the greek practice of licensing 
private collectors who must register their treasures with the 
authorities

stripped to kill ii mgmua vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
stripped to kill ii is a mystery about a serial killer with a 
lot of gratuitous stripping as one would expect from the title 
its really not a bad movie but the filmmakers seemed to think that 
since the action takes place in a strip joint they must focus on 
that lost art 
the story has a number of nice twists and a good buildup of 
suspense as the climax nears unfortunately the pace is constantly 
interrupted by the obligatory disrobing of wouldbe victims 
interestingly the biggest failure of stripped to kill ii is 
its misguided attempt at eroticism what is intended as a tease is 
merely a turnoff the other major failing in the movie is the 
stilted and clicheridden dialogue 
but the quality of the filming is very good with a nice smoky 
sleazy atmosphere in the club and its environs 
the mystery is pretty simple the paragon clubs strippers are 
being killed onebyone each has her throat slashed and before 
each murder a stripper maria ford has a dream about the gruesome 
death

full moon fever mca tom petty 
 
judging by his first solo album full moon fever it seems 
tom pettys heart is no longer with the heartbreakers 
hes a wilbury now brevity in lyrics and simplicity in music 
seems to be the lessons hes taken from his tenure with the 
traveling wilburys 
full moon fever can almost get an identical critical 
assessment as the traveling wilburys record both albums are filled 
with breezy feelgood songs that are essentially lightweight but 
sound terrific 
all his fellow wilburys save bob dylan make appearances 
coproducer jeff lynne who also had his hand in writing seven of 
the 12 songs is the most prominent 
pettys laconic nature is occasionally funny like on this 
perverse nursery rhyme from yer so bad my sister got lucky 
married a yuppie took him for all he was worth now shes a 
swinger dating a singer i cant decide which is worse 
on the majestic melody free fallin petty says more in a 
fiveword chorus than many songwriters do in a whole song like on 
paul mccartneys my brave face the narrators joy at newfound 
freedom from a relationship is mixed with despair at his loss 
his cover of the byrds feel a whole lot better is a dead 
ringer for pettys own listen to her heart the tunes are all 
relatively conservative poprock fare except for the grungy guitar 
of runnin down a dream and the closing romp zombie zoo 
judging by the early sales figures pettys wilbury work has 
introduced him to an older generation of fans that might otherwise 
have suspiciously looked upon him hes stripped his music to the 
essentials on full moon fever to make that introduction that 
much easier

emancipated from teenage movies andrew 
mccarthy finds himself almost upstaged by a corpse in his new film 
in weekend at bernies mccarthy and jonathan silverman are 
insurance company yuppies invited for a holiday at their boss 
palatial beach house in the hamptons on long island in new york 
they arrive to find their host executed by the mafia the rest of 
the movie concerns the two mens efforts to make bernie seem alive 
to his many friends and party guests 
while some critics have called weekend at bernies a onejoke 
movie most admit that it is often hilarious they especially cite 
the performance of the corpse who is actor terry kiser there are 
even predictions that the film could be the summers sleeper 
mccarthy admitted he had qualms about playing opposite a stiff 
i laughed when i read the script he said but i also 
thought this can be very morbid but somehow it all seemed so 
harmless to me 
terry who plays bernie is so good at it hes one guy when 
hes alive and somebody else when hes dead hes never dead 
really it just takes the curse off it somehow we treat him as if 
he were just another guy 
you find yourself laughing in spite of yourself i saw the 
picture and i did my usual cringing about his performance then i 
found myself laughing its so disarming 
mccarthy observed that kiser didnt have any lines to learn he 
just lay there and got all the laughs but kiser did get tossed 
around and he suffered a few broken ribs that sidelined him for a 
while 
weekend at bernies marks a departure for andrew mccarthy 
it was so refreshing for me because im used to playing a nice 
sensitive moral guy who does the right thing he commented 
that can be a little boring in real life as well as movies 
i thought larry his character is a terrific guy because he 
thought he was very savvy and worldly and witty and the babes loved 
him of course hes wrong about everything underneath it all hes 
like a scared little kid but he puts on a wonderful performance for 
the world hes selfish in a lot of things but he couldnt hurt a 
fly 
mccarthys early film career cast him as teenagers in such films 
as class heaven help us and pretty in pink even when he 
was in his 20s now 26 he minimizes the matter of the transition to 
adulthood 
thats one of those questions that other people seem to be 
concerned about he said i played teenagers because i was a 
teenager i played 20yearolds because i was 20 
i dont want to be 30 years old playing a guy whos borrowing 
dads car to go out to the movies but i think if you tend to 
business those things take care of themselves 
born in westfield nj andrew mccarthy started in high school 
plays studied acting at new york universiry and new yorks circle 
in the square after two years of schooling he answered a cattle 
call for the role of a preppie who has an affair with his roommates 
mother jacqueline bisset in class 
his parents reaction to his acting career 
when i said i was going to college for acting they said fine 
as long as i was going to college when i called up and said i was 
going to play jacqueline bissets lover in a movie my dad said 
bring her home to dinner son 
mccarthy who recently bought a house in greenwich village is a 
confirmed easterner 
i love new york im comfortable there he said i like the 
pace i like the environment im not comfortable here i dont like 
getting in the car to go to the 711 im more comfortable where my 
friends and family are 
here everyone i know eats lives breathes the business show 
business its got its place but not 24 hours a day for me 
about being a celebrity in new york nobody cares they just 
care that theyre going to beat you to that cab people in new york 
are just trying to get through the day which is not necessarily 
good but i dont have any problems and i dont travel in circles 
that are very showbiz oriented 
mccarthy was leaving for france where he will appear as the 
young henry miller in quiet days at clichy directed by claude 
chabrol the actor will be appearing in a film unlikely to achieve a 
wide release at a fraction of his usual salary 
its one of those opportunities that is too good to pass up 
he explained to play something that is offbeat and work with 
wonderful european guys and play a wonderful character knock on 
wood something may come of it that people approve of

the nude maya did not make it this time nor 
did the clothed version and most other goya paintings 
velasquez famous maids of honor and el grecos the dream 
of philip ii stayed away too as shipping them was considered too 
risky 
however 73 other spanish masterpieces that also survived spains 
civil war in 193639 are currently on show at genevas museum of art 
and history marking the 50th anniversary of an unprecedented 
international art salvage operation 
shortly before midnight feb 13 1939 22 french railway cars 
crammed with 1868 crates rolled into genevas freightyard under a 
pioneering accord reached at figueras between an international group 
of art experts and the spanish loyalist government 
the cargo ranged from the treasures of madrids prado museum to 
priceless tapestries and ancient manuscripts the inventory filled 
193 pages listing 43 grecos 45 works by velasquez and 138 goyas 
among the 1300 paintings some had been brought over footpaths 
across the nearby spanishfrench border before being put on the 
railway cars in perpignan 
the addressee was joseph avenol secretary general of the league 
of nations the genevabased forerunner of the united nations 
avenol a french diplomat reluctantly agreed to take charge of the 
hoard storing it at the vast library of the newlybuilt palais des 
nations now the un office in geneva 
arduous negotiations preceded the transfer to geneva last stop 
in an odyssey that began nov 10 1936 four days before besieged 
madrid came under intensive aerial bombardment nine incendiary 
bombs hit the prado but the most important works of art had already 
been removed from the museum 
they were taken first to valencia then to the barcelona region 
and finally to figueras where the accord to place the treasures 
under the personal guardianship of avenol was signed late on feb 3 
the signing was done by the light of matches because nationalist 
bombs had caused a blackout according to documentation prepared for 
genevas threemonth anniversary show by spanish historian arturo 
colorado castellary 
avenol sticking to the league of nations controversial 
noninterventionist policy agreed to take charge of the hoard 
only after an international committee of independent art experts was 
formed to negotiate the transfer 
the committee was headed by david davidweill president of 
frances council of national museums who also contributed most of 
the private donations which funded the operation it included 
british french us dutch belgian and swiss members 
at the last minute the spaniards had a clause inserted which 
stipulated that once peace was reestablished all objects must be 
returned only to the government of spain to remain as the common 
property of the spanish nation 
in his memoirs loyalist foreign minister julio alvarez del vayo 
wrote this was meant to make sure that the national patrimony would 
not wind up in the hands of hitler and mussolini who backed the 
nationalist insurgents with bombers and ground forces 
suggestions to send the paintings to the united states had 
already been declined in 1937 because of washingtons growing 
sympathy with the insurgents led by gen francisco franco according 
to alvarez del vayo only a few weeks after the figueras accord 
franco brought all of spain under his control 
the new nationalist government demanded the immediate return of 
the art treasures on may 10 a special train left geneva for spain 
with all but 196 objects two days earlier spain had withdrawn from 
the league of nations following nazi germany and fascist italy 
at the request of the geneva authorities the new spanish regime 
agreed to leave temporarily behind 175 paintings and 21 tapestries 
to be shown at an exhibition that made geneva the cultural 
capital of europe as an enthusiastic comment in the local press 
put it 
the exhibition that ran for exactly three months became the 
biggest art event of which switzerland was ever host more than 
400000 visitors including exking alfonso xiii of spain and the 
duke and duchess of windsor admired the exhibits in genevas art 
and history museum the net profit 350000 swiss francs equivalent 
to about 1750000 francs today or 1 million went to spain 
the exhibition closed aug 31 at 1030 pm seven hours and 10 
minutes later adolf hitler announced that german troops had invaded 
poland marking the outbreak of world war ii

jackson browne has sold millions of records with 
songs based on the promise of good times 
hes also capable of poking fun at the cold war with lawyers in 
love performing a spirited cover of the golden oldie stay or 
bringing audiences to their feet with running on empty 
but rather than telling tales of 57 chevys and teen angels 
browne prefers prayers for pretenders and demands for peace and 
justice 
sometimes offering a prayer is a way of focusing your hopes and 
aspirations and appealing to forces outside of yourself the 
40yearold musician said thats what some of these songs are at 
times 
in the 1970s browne was part of a new wave of artists emerging 
from california that included the eagles linda ronstadt bonnie 
raitt and warren zevon but hes transformed from a 
singersongwriter of the me generation to political activist 
openly embracing civil rights antiapartheid forces in south africa 
and the sandinistas in nicaragua 
i have more interests now said browne who lives with 
actress daryl hannah i dont know if thats a function of aging 
or that many of the other issues in my life are settled or on the 
way to being settled 
i was beginning to hear about central america working in the 
70s on ecological and environmental issues you come face to face 
with government duplicity 
he began reading attending lectures and traveling political 
commitment has dominated his last two records lives in the 
balance and world in motion 
browne combines folk hard rock and reggae with attacks on 
president reagan and tributes to the people of central america and 
south africa 
most music has a political context browne said whether 
its on the surface or not whether people recognize it as such in 
the united states theres an old quote if you got a message try 
western union i dont think its true in latin america where the 
political songs are very powerful 
but despite his passion for the rights of all people his 
audience remains predominantly white he cited style as a major 
problem 
it could depend whether or not youre speaking in the same 
language browne said if you want to find a form of music that 
is talking about a lot of the same things but to that audience 
its rap theres real political music going on in the united 
states public enemy krsone hundreds and hundreds of bands 
describing life as it is 
on world in motion he covers my personal revenge a song 
cowritten by tomas borge the nicaraguan minister of the interior 
browne heard a tape of the song while driving outside of managua and 
was impressed by its message of forgiveness 
borge had been tortured by the national guard as he left the 
prison he was tortured in he said he would be back for his revenge 
three or four years later after the sandinista revolution in 
1979 he found himself looking through the prisoners for this man 
who had tortured him browne said 
he found himself amongst a bunch of people who had been working 
in the very same prison he found the man who had tortured him told 
him he would now take his revenge and began reading the poem 
the world seemed much simpler for browne when he released his 
debut album saturate before using in 1972 he was just another 
unknown young songwriter hoping his throughtful lyrics and spare 
arrangements would attract attention 
it wasnt so much a busines then brown recalled as i 
wrote my early songs i was aware of not being able to tell whether 
somebody would like it i remember thinking wouldnt it be great 
if people might want to hear my songs come to a club and see me 
play 
his appeal widened in 1976 with the pretender while 
recording the album his wife committed suicide and browne poured 
his heart into the title track the fuse and here come those 
tears again 
there are songs i think were too introspective browne said 
at first i always used a narrative form like song for adam 
its more or less true what i was saying i was trying to connect 
what happened to him with my own life 
that was on my first record but by the time of my fourth 
record people begin reading about your life in rolling stone and it 
becomes difficult to use the narrative form it stops being about 
anybodys life and starts being about your life 
he loosened up for the live running on empty and was stunned 
when the record went platinum 
it was not my best work he said it wasnt as serious an 
album as late for the sky and the pretender it was a suspension 
of values a break from what id been talking about it just 
decribes a certain kind of life theres very little of the depth of 
the previous records 
browne remains inspired by the protest music of the 60s and 
tries to write in the same spirit 
rock n roll is supposed to be rebellious so much of what is 
considered rebellious today is so patented tried and true heavy 
metal acts are not rebellion its rebellion against a very very 
tame picture of order he said 
some songs from the 60s like mr tambourine man implied 
freedom and values that were present in rock n roll you couldnt 
find it in the straight culture i would accept that definition of 
my music as subversive

want to attend the sermon on the mount see the 
premiere of shakespeares twelfth night help angry patriots 
dump tea into boston harbor 
if so then dorothy curley has the trip of a lifetime in the 
lifetime of your choice 
traveling back in time to witness the worlds more momentous 
occasions is the premise of curleys new fictional book the 
complete time traveler a tourists guide to the fourth dimension 
we supposedly wrote the book 50 years from now she said 
curley coauthor howard blumenthal and illustrator brad williams 
explain in the complete time traveler that this anniversary 
edition is being offered 50 years prior to publication to help 
improve understanding of time travel before its supposed 
implementation in the year 2027 
the revised guide they say is based on their own frequent 
sojourns into the past as 21stcentury time travelers 
time travel is now the nations top leisure time activity 
the authors write in the books introduction dated 2038 with 
minimal preparation and your choice of time machine you can be 
assured of a safe and rewarding trip to the location and era of your 
choice 
but time travelers beware you cant tamper with the past 
its safer to just say you cant change the past just for 
dramatic purposes curley said otherwise we couldnt send 
anybody back to do anything because we wouldnt be there 
you also cant slip into the future according to the complete 
time traveler unless youre willing to stay there for good 
the first thing thats going to happen when time travel is a 
reality is that the governments going to take over and tell you 
what you can do and what you cant do curley said in an interview 
that regulating agency according to the book is the federal 
time travel commission 
if you know what stock is going to do what or what horse is 
going to win or what lottery number is going to hit then basically 
the world economy would collapse curley said plus you could 
travel to the future and see your own death that would be pretty 
weird 
weirdness aside the complete time traveler is the first 
credible attempt to assume time travel is real and then play with 
it said george young editorinchief of ten speed press the 
berkeley calif publisher released 7500 hardback copies of the 
212page book early this year a paperback edition is being 
considered as well as a sequel 
it takes that assumption and gives it a totally different 
twist young said its like somebody came up with a dictionary 
for a language that doesnt exist 
curley 35 a freelance television producer director and writer 
who lives on a 133acre farm in southwestern pennsylvania became 
fascinated with the idea of time travel as a child but it wasnt 
until she was explaining it in 1985 to her friend blumenthal an 
author and syndicated columnist in sea cliff ny that she decided 
to write a lighthearted treatise on the subject 
theres something here for people who need something new to 
play with their minds blumenthal told her 
the two sent a 40page proposal to new york publishers who liked 
the idea but told them the work couldnt be categorized so they 
couldnt put it out 
curley admits the book is difficult to describe 
its not really parody and its not really satire she said 
i can tell you everything its not i really have trouble defining 
what it is its more imagination 
in mid1987 ten speed gave curley and blumenthal one year to 
write the complete time traveler during a brainstorming 
session the authors came up with their own version of time travel 
a belt that enables people to slip inside wormholes by raising the 
bodys vibration level to that of a wormhole 
while there is no proof wormholes exist some physicists believe 
the supposed holes in space and time possibly could be used as a 
tunnel to return to another era or to travel to distant parts of the 
universe that notion has its roots in albert einsteins special 
relativity theory which deals with the relationships among space 
time matter and energy and includes his formula energy equals 
mass times the speed of light squared the theory says the speed of 
light is constant regardless of whether the source of light is 
moving curley spent weeks acquainting herself with the latest 
scientific thought on time travel she also frequented the local 
library to gather historical trivia for her chapter on time travel 
destinations 
she learned for example that julius caesar banned delivery 
carts in the daytime because of traffic jams forcing carts to be 
unloaded at night time travelers therefore are advised to nap 
during the day when visiting rome in the first century bc 
she also learned that during the indianapolis speedways opening 
on aug 21 1909 charles merzs car blew a tire on the south turn 
of the last race killing two spectators and a mechanic time 
travelers consequently are urged to avoid the south turn area 
the authors found the no 1 attraction in earths history to be 
jesus sermon on the mount 
what we decided curley explained smiling is that of 
these many many many thousands of people who were there there 
were really only about 22 natives the rest were all tourists 
because how did all those people know when to show up

gailard sartain tried out for acting 
roles in high school and college but never made the cast 
but he didnt give up on his ambition to become an actor thanks 
to his perseverance hes become a familiar face on tv and in movies 
during the past 17 years 
the rotund 44yearold performer has been doing skits since 1972 
on hee haw the syndicated country musichumor show on tv hes 
also appeared in 23 movies most recently portraying a sheriff in 
mississippi burning 
he didnt get discouraged after being rejected for parts in 
productions while in high school in his native tulsa okla and at 
the university of tulsa 
i tried out for stuff but never got in sartain recalled in 
an interview at a tv studio in the grand ole opry house as he 
awaited hee haw tapings to resume 
i wasnt in the right clique or in the theater department he 
said even in high school there was a clique at the college 
level it was a major clique and if you werent a drama major you 
might get to play a doorstop or something 
he first got noticed in the early 1970s while doing some comedy 
routines as host of latenight movies on a tulsa tv station this 
led to hee haw and his hee haw skits led to dramatic motion 
picture roles 
he portrayed the big bopper in the buddy holly story and 
also was in hard country with janmichael vincent and kim 
basinger roadie with art carney and meat loaf and the jerk 
and all of me both starring steve martin 
on hee haw hes best known as the bumbling maynard in a 
general store segment and hammerhead in a spot about a hotel he 
also has been in segments originating in a flea market and a truck 
stop this fall hell be seen in two new spots eyewitless news 
and the kornfield kounty kourtroom 
because of his comedy work in the cornpone hee haw some 
people didnt recognize him as the sheriff in mississippi 
burning 
ive been told people dont believe i was the sheriff 
sartain said they say no not maynard what are you talking 
about 
he considers his work in mississippi burning as his best to 
date 
its a quality film and i enjoyed it it was a real departure 
for me a couple of scenes of mine were brutal there was an 
undercurrent of hatred and hostility it was a gigantic departure 
from hee haw 
he has already finished two other movies that will be released in 
coming months blaze starring paul newman and love at 
large starring tom berenger 
he enjoys the camaraderie of hee haw which is taped in june 
and october thus permitting him to accept movie roles the rest of 
the year 
its a family feeling sartain said you dont have to 
force anything its like a giant birthday party 
he believes the show has lasted since 1968 because of the 
relaxing feeling it projects 
once you become acclimated to the show its comfortable its 
a literal institution as far as television goes i think people know 
what to expect and like it 
the longevity of the show has surprised even him 
i felt 15 years ago that i had one year left now it could go 
on another two months or 10 years it depends on who is left 
standing

fashionwatchers from new york to tokyo have been 
spotting battalions of quilted chain bags gold buttons and 
braidpiped suits all familiar chanel symbols 
you might even see a hairy man wearing a chanel tshirt an 
incongruous offshoot of the newest wave of the chanel cult 
coco chanel died in 1971 but her designs never seem to go 
out of style and imitators have scrambled to make hay from the 
recent boom the plethora of fakes infuriates the house of chanel 
currently suing copyists right and left 
but as chanel said my ideas belong to everyone and the 
chanel craze goes on apace 
nowadays the chanel look connotes both status and chic even 
when runway shows are updated with wild departures from the old 
formulas by the houses designer karl lagerfeld 
in her heyday chanel was a revolutionary at a time when 
proper postvictorians were still gussied up in feathers and 
corsets chanel was busy ridding clothes of extraneous trappings 
stripping them down to the basics then dressing them up with pearls 
born in 1883 to a poor family in central france gabrielle chanel 
worked her way to the top as she discovered high society through her 
lovers 
her lifelong sobriquet of coco came from a song cocorico 
cockadoodledo she sang at a music hall in vichy clever with 
her hands she loved dressing up in her own homemade costumes 
by 1913 an english admirer named boy capel had set her up in 
a milliners shop in fashionable deauville 
too proud to imitate the wealthy women she met chanel set her 
own styles and soon everyone was copying her pareddown elegance 
her jaunty boater hats her middycollared dresses 
other designers like poiret and vionnet were loosening up on 
their clothes by 1914 when world war i began but it was coco who 
best caught the spirit of the jazz age she openly flouted 
conventions at a time when other women began wanting more freedom 
and her clothes suited the new mood 
women flocked in from the ritz across the street when she opened 
her shop in the rue cambon in 1919 as the twenties roared in to the 
charleston chanel with her relaxed assured manner and clothes to 
match had an instant success as she put it i woke up famous 
her own best model she shortened her skirts wore long cardigans 
with pockets and bobbed her long hair masses of women followed 
suit 
she pioneered pants for women with flowing pajamas worn by garbo 
and dietrich on the flickering screen she made the little black 
dress a glamour item with many strands of imitation pearls 
always mademoiselle to her staff she never married any of 
the celebrated men who courted her if her heart was broken she was 
unbowed toiling on as a ceaseless perfectionist 
after world war ii chanel moved to switzerland where she kept 
company with a german officer 
her attempted comeback in 1954 met with sullen press commentary 
diors 1947 new look sensation had still not worn off and the 
fashion mavens wanted more exciting news than chanels quiet little 
suits brought 
but chanel didnt stay long in the shade the time was ripe for 
her outfits which were both comfortable and glamorous without 
looking stiffly sophisticated 
women in the street were tiring of the new look and loved 
chanels style especially the braidedged suits with quilted 
linings 
by the time she died at 87 she had twice won and then held her 
place at the top of the fashion heap the house of chanel coasted on 
her old models and reputation until 1983 when germanborn lagerfeld 
came sweeping in like a bracing blast of fresh air and chanel was 
hot news again 
lagerfelds odder innovations like 18thcenturystyle panniers 
have shaken up some steadfast chanel fans 
but theres always an identifiable chanel suit in the collections 
to please conservatives and lagerfeld has blown up chanel details 
chains pearls the crossed c logo into a fetish that borders on 
high camp 
he sees the current craze as suited to todays rock culture in 
the chains and leather allied to the chanel cachet which is a 
passport for respectability 
chanel accessories simply work says ellin saltzman fashion 
director of saks fifth avenue in new york the bags hang right on 
your shoulder and the chains and buttons dress up anything 
working women love chanel as it is both serious and 
femininelooking fashion exaggeration like baby doll and vamp 
looks dont go down well in an office says chantal clayeux a 
french government employee chanel does 
the best of chanel looks right in almost any situation as coco 
chanel herself once observed an elegant woman must be able to do 
the marketing without making the other housewives laugh the ones 
who laugh are always right

us president george bush helps a hong kong 
tailor advertise his shirts while henry kissinger and entertainers 
robert wagner and david bowie promote suits at another establishment 
they may not realize this but their photographs are prominently 
displayed to encourage business at the shops where they had clothes 
made on visits to this british colony 
kissinger is a good customer and he comes back every two 
years said an employee at sams tailor which also boasts as 
regular customers a collection of british bluebloods and other world 
figures 
at the shop where photographs of prominent customers share space 
with bolts of suit material all the employees answer to the name 
sam but the owner a 65yearold indian from bombay who began the 
business in l950 is known as the sam 
we dont keep a camera the customers bring their photographers 
and send us the pictures sams elder son said in an interview 
at ascot chang co ltd which specializes in shirts theres a 
picture of bush who squeezed in an appointment in l985 when he was 
vice president and stopped over in hong kong for 20 hours 
he called and asked us to go up to his hotel room for his 
measurements said manager tony chang whose father started the 
business more than 30 years ago he is very classic he likes pure 
colors especially light blue 
chang said bush later placed several mail orders for shirts but 
he now gets them from a branch office which ascot opened in new york 
two years ago 
bush paid about 5130 for each shirt during his hong kong visit 
and his mail order shirts cost about 97 each because of mail and 
import charges said chang 
the shirts cost 11850 in the states because of taxes he 
said 
with the variety of imported fabrics readily available in hong 
kong the colony has long had a reputation for its tailormade 
suits the hong kong tourist association says there are more than 
2500 tailor shops in hong kong 
but tailors say the once famous 24hour suit measured at 
breakfast served with the next breakfast is now discouraged by 
reputable tailors who take pride in their work and prefer customers 
to allow at least three days for two fittings 
john wang a director of robert tailoring and co ltd in the 
luxurious mandarin hotel said it normally takes three days to make 
a suit but tourists pressed for time can have their orders mailed 
without extra charge 
we pay the tailors double for an urgent order but we do not 
charge this to customers otherwise they will not come back said 
wang he said 80 percent of his business involves regular customers 
both tourists and hong kong residents 
prices for suits vary depending on style and material but they 
usually range between 192 and 385 the equivalent of a suit bought 
off the rack in some countries tailors say 
stephen young a furniture salesman from portland maine spent 
four days in hong kong recently and decided on the day before his 
departure to order a suit 
everybody said i should have a suit made in hong kong so i 
did he explained 
but he wanted a special material super 120s tuxedo cashmere and 
mink he visited several tailor shops before he found one that 
stocked the fabric 
he was immediately measured had a fitting before his departure 
and was promised the suit by mail within three weeks the suit cost 
512 but young said it would still be cheaper than a readymade one 
in maine 
also he added they dont have it tailored in maine 
tailors say some customers arrive with photographs or drawings of 
suits they want and the tailors readily work on their creations 
david bowie wanted a silk suit said sams son robert 
wagner brought one suit for us to copy kissinger is a bit 
conservative he did not have any special requests 
with the popularity of hong kongs tailored suits some stores 
have opened branches overseas while others regularly dispatch 
representatives on trips to measure customers for clothes that are 
then made and mailed to them 
this allows them to have a hong kong suit without visiting hong 
kong explained one tailor

the good news about styles for the early 1990s is 
that they seem to be aimed at women with minds of their own rather 
than at sheepish fashionplates to be herded into ridiculous garb to 
look trendy 
theres a vast choice in the offerings to send the 1980s out in 
style the clothes are hardly revolutionary but the best are timely 
and as freshly appealing as champagne 
designers are letting go of their recent visions of bouncy 
ruffly little girls in poufs as well as slinky vamps 
finally theyre thinking of women who work travel and like to 
feel easy and pretty in whatever they choose whether the clothes 
are based on masculine styles or are all dressed up for evening 
they are presented with an eye to both ease and elegance 
silhouettes and fabrics are softer in these new clothes with a 
light touch of bodyconsciousness in the structuring shoulders are 
padded for shape but never dominate 
skirt lengths are barely relevant though quite long and above 
the knee are the youngerlooking norms karl lagerfeld at chanel 
dismisses any discussion of skirt lengths as being for old 
crones his answer to youth is to show some outfits without any 
skirt at all simply tights under handsome jackets 
trousers are a welcome solution though the wide aline look has 
been cut back to somewhat straighter lines on the dressy side in 
suits with waist tucking as at saint laurent and jeanlouis 
scherrer 
jackets are starred everywhere they range from very long styles 
flattering as they cover the derriere to snug spencers battle 
jackets and boleros details may be strong in piping zigzag 
fastening little belts or vents at the back 
and several designers give fantasy touches with swallowtail or 
cutaway styles in dressier models 
coats are another big story if you like trench or belted 
bathrobe styles youll find handsome ones for fall 
italians designers like tarlazzi and romeo gigli cocoon their 
models in sumptuous coats tarlazzis camelcolored wrap with a 
bright lining is remarkable giglis opulent byzantine cocoons are 
so colorful they seem to have already matured into butterflies 
christian lacroix plays with the cape theme in loud color 
combinations with his short suits or in more subdued styles to evoke 
the england of vita sackvillewest and the literary bloomsbury set 
capes are glamorous at saint laurent and hot numbers at patrick 
kelly where little caped riding hoods are as fun as they are 
colorful 
as classic suits have come back into focus in the fashion 
picture so have soft dresses looking better than ever as buttoned 
coat dresses shirtdresses and little shifts 
fabrics are important for these stylishly soft clothes making 
them more fluid and sensual than ever even the flecked caviar 
tweeds large plaids stripes and houndstooth checks offer new 
choices at christian lacroix scherrer and elsewhere 
synthetics such as fake furs and wool or silk blends are looking 
better than ever and the new softer lighter woolens are a boon to 
travelers whod rather arrive not looking rumpled 
folk art is making a chic comeback with lacroixs favorite 
provencal motifs or kilim rug designs as well as the handsome black 
and white chanel knits borrowed from indian weaves 
scherrer and hanae mori are keen on exotic animal prints and 
weaves and scherrers feather patterns add a light touch as well 
look for temptingly light jerseys cashmeres and knits in cables 
and other textures this season along with soft flannel and 
broadcloth the new tweed and serge dont scratch 
the uptodate gold mustard olive and forest green lavender 
and deep purple or pink add a heathery touch to autumn wardrobes 
but paris isnt timid about color the designers are prodigious 
in their use of red everything from deep raspberry or garnet to 
cardinal orangecoral fuchsia fire engine or flame these also 
mix well with deep brown purple or black 
the evening scene means a transformation from workaday outfits to 
splendidly feminine clothes for cocktails at the ritz or dinner at 
maxims black is still reliable for sexy little lace or velvet 
numbers and never before have silk grain de poudre tuxedo 
outfits with pants or skirts looked so attractively varied or 
feminine 
but overall were seeing more lateday color in decollete or 
bustier dresses with practical little jackets 
lame and brocade give dazzle to clothes for welcoming in 1990 
especially the japanese flowerprint patterns at hanae mori and the 
byzantine motifs at lacroix gigli and elsewhere 
scenestealing hats for these glamorous clothes are lacroixs 
mad hatter chapeau his big buccaneer hat and largebrimmed 
skimmers at chanel turbans berets and fur toques are also good 
head warmers as well as fashionable

britains reputation as a fashion capital for 
individualists has been reinforced with autumn collections that 
offer everything from fringes fake fur and animal prints to classic 
wools and perennial velvets 
the result is anything goes with no single direction for 
british fashion 
skirts are long or short pants are narrow or very full jackets 
are long and lean or short and swingy the looks are ethnic or 
cowboy or biker or russian or prim miss marple english 
i think anything goes this season says david sassoon of 
bellville sassoon who designs evening dresses for princess diana 
but i think people have found it difficult to buy i think theyve 
found too many kooky clothes and not enough that people will wear 
marie gavrielides of warwick ri whose company kellouies 
sells to private clients agrees saying the british shows with a 
few exceptions were too high fashion for the states 
paris is more classic she says americans are way too 
classic for most of these collections everything moves so much 
faster in england designs are very up very progressive 
the greatest excitement seems to be generated at the young end of 
the fashion scene with the accessory and clothing firm pink soda 
setting the trend for the 1525 generation 
its collection inspired by india morocco and turkey features 
lots of embroidery animal prints fringed scarves corsetlike 
bustiers with lurex coins bells and pompons and plenty of ethnic 
necklaces all are topped with fake fur or patterned velvet bowler 
hats 
weve had a lot of interest from the states more than in the 
last five years says david solomon head of the firm 
helen storeys beaded chiffon bra tops fringed zebra bolero and 
onepiece leather chaps with attached boots also are big hits in the 
young market 
some top british designers took the bizarre route during recent 
london showings 
katharine hamnetts bikerlook collection harking back to the 
1970s includes a skintight black velour jumpsuit worn with 
highcut black leather briefs and a leather bomber jacket with metal 
studs bearing her latest ecology slogan clean up or die 
rifat ozbek winner of the british fashion councils designer of 
the year award returned to his turkish roots with bellydancer bras 
fringed with gold coins leopardprint pants and berberstriped 
coats 
at the other end of the fashion spectrum for autumn and winter 
are the more traditional designers who have become part of britains 
fashion establishment 
jean muir features loose jumpsuits gina fratini has black velvet 
strapless ones molded to the body and covered with indian 
mirroredcloth jackets caroline charles reflects miss marple 
agatha christies elderly sleuth who personifies british solidity 
with long lean earthcolored tweeds trimmed in fake fur ally 
capellino also does a prim english look with skirts down to the 
ankle 
edina ronays collection includes animal prints velvet suits 
with gold beading and colored venetian silks said the americans 
are coming back after several seasons in the wings 
david sassoon whose midichiffons and short sequinned wool 
jerseys were big sellers also says sales to the united states are 
up the americans want glamorous clothes that women will wear and 
they come here for evening wear no doubt about it 
but betty jackson who did a softer more feminine collection 
with a new aline silhouette based on tibetan and mongolian themes 
says the americans have been difficult for a few seasons now 
i think they come as voyeurs

giorgio armanis sporty emporio line and 
spoof specialist franco moschinos gagfilled wardrobe headline the 
italian readytowear collections for fall and winter 
pants in all shapes and sizes prevail in both collections with 
only a scattering of skirts 
armani plays heavily on casual wear with the emporio label which 
he created to reach a younger more priceconscious clientele 
featured are wool knit sweat pants worn under tweed blazers or 
matching jackets other trousers are super wide and cropped at the 
ankle with or without cuffs 
his new winter jackets are cut off above the waist at times they 
have long loose backs at others they are trimmed in demure 
piecrust ruffles his blazer is single breasted with huge breast 
and side pockets a look he introduced under his more exclusive 
armani label several seasons ago 
there are plenty of beautiful coats from the classic polo to 
cape coats and fun furs armani no longer uses real skins in his 
designs and offers fake sable mink and bear coats to make his 
point even stronger he has dotted his leather wear from shoes to 
purses with fake leopard spots 
evening at emporio is very 1930ish with long clinging black 
jersey velvet dresses enhanced by small velvet hats complete with 
feathers and feathercuffed gloves he also favors the tuxedo look 
with silk lapels studs and black ties 
armani has never used bright colors in his collections and the 
emporio line is no exception browns grays blacks and traditional 
fall shades only lightly spattered with bright red and green make 
up his favorite palette 
franco moschino on the other hand is far less subdued with a 
reputation as a fashion jokester including gags like tape measure 
belts dinner jackets decorated with real flatware and an irish 
sweater with a ball of yarn and knitting needles still attached at 
the collar 
but behind moschinos jokes is a very serious designer with lots 
of superbly designed clothes 
for fall and winter moschino prefers pants with wide bell bottoms 
and long jackets with large cloth buttons 
like armani he prefers to let animals keep their skins choosing 
opulent fuzzy coats and stoles in harmless synthetic fabric

jewellers who both are marketing scarves handbags and other small 
leather goods 
tiffanys entry into scarves began with a few designs made up for 
the stores 150th anniversary two years ago sales at 150 each 
were so rewarding that the store now currently stocks about 200 
designs at its outlets around the country and overseas exotic 
florals and chinoiserie bordered with logo designs dominate the

extension of our jewelry says tiffanys design director john

themselves 
tiffany handbags are dressy and classic in silk and leather all 
with signature details including one with a large t closure 
cartiers scarves include some imprinted with graphics of 
precious jewelry signed with stores boutique logo must de 
cartier they blend with a line of silk evening bags with similar

use to make a distinctive statement both about their individual 
personalities and their success without stepping out of bounds of 
proper male etiquette says jill romeo king boutique manager at

price range widely but most are affordable for most people some of 
the most common and popular gems include peridot bright green 
rubellite tourmaline hot pink aquamarine pale blue kunzite 
pale pink citrine honey tones and amethyst purple 
william g underwood president of the society says interest in

diana chose a sapphire and diamond engagement ring an ags survey 
also revealed strong preference for pearls 
these pieces increase in both sentimental and actual value 
underwood says and they never go out of style many of the 
popular jewelry designs today came from the 40s and 50s when pearls 
and pins were staple items in a womans jewelry wardrobe 
new york jewelry designer denise solay adds jewelry is 
seasonless and timeless and allows a woman to make a personal 
statement on her own terms she markets her designs strongly

sportswear makes up a big portion of the american wardrobe 
whether the wearers are really dedicated to fitness and sports or 
just experiencing them vicariously by adapting the styles to street 
and casual wear 
the national sporting goods association says that americans last 
year spent about 16 billion on sweatshirts and pants 752 million 
on walking shoes 461 million on warmup suits 460 million on 
running shoes 327 million on aerobic shoes and 88 million on 
leotards and bodysuits 
those serious about their activities are finding new fabrics and 
gear that will make them more comfortable in their pursuits the 
rest of the sportswear customers can simply enjoy the sports cachet 
in bold bright and comfortable clothes 
active wear has become anywear says randy ronning jc 
penneys mens fashion director skiinspired jackets that may 
never see a slope come in great colors and color blocks in the same 
fabrics and with stitch detailing like the real thing 
but those really heading for the slopes the hunting grounds or 
the running tracks can test new fabrics for insulation 
sweatwicking and water protection some of these are based on du 
ponts high trek a combination of orlon wool and a hollowcore 
fiber called hollofil being used in sweaters socks hats scarves 
and thermal underwear du pont says the yarns evaporate perspiration 
more efficiently are fluffier warmer and less itchy than natural 
fabrics 
the company also markets coolmax supplex lycra and microfine 
lighterweight elastic and nylonbased blends that offer various 
degrees of wicking wind and water protection flexibility and 
comfort in clothes for biking swimming and similar activities 
for some especially customers in the teen and young adult 
market the main attractions are trendiness and flash these are 
found in skintight bikers pants leotards in prints and jacquard 
textures and the ubiquitous tshirts with big graphic abstract 
prints most in primary or neon colors a line of leotards and tops 
with the imprimatur of ballet star mikhail baryshnikov is typical of 
the clothes that blur the line between athletic function and fashion 
others can find clothing with team logos from across the sports 
spectrum penneys has a new line of sportswear tied in with the 
1992 olympics featuring sportswear screened with usa olympic 
logotypes

socks may seem a trivial part of your sportswear wardrobe until 
youve rubbed up painful blisters or grown a crop of athletes foot 
fungus to put you out of action 
unrelieved foot perspiration can lead to blisters and fungus 
infection as well as very unpleasant odor says dr marc 
brenner a podiatrist specializing in sports medicine 
simply stated blisters happen when your feet sweat and the sweat 
has nowhere to go natural fibers that absorb perspiration but dont 
move it away from your skin leave your feet moist soft and 
vulnerable to the friction you naturally get from walking or 
running and since the insides of your shoes also will be warm and 
airless youll be a walking culture medium for fungus 
several manufacturers of sports socks are using an updated 
version of an old standby orlon to counter these problems the 
makers thorlo burlington sai and ridgeview worked with dupont 
in developing ultratech orlon a fiber that they say wicks moisture 
away from the wearer at least three times faster than cotton

because todays expectant mothers continue to work through most 
of their pregnancies they choose more fashionable maternity clothes 
and plan to continue wearing them after delivery says a maternity 
wear designer 
judy loeb design director for the trio line from jeanette 
maternities inc says women arent borrowing these clothes as much 
as they did in the past because new designs are more appropriate to 
the workplace loeb who designed the popular rhinestonedecorated 
baby tshirt several years ago says these pointers should be 
kept in mind when shopping for the new styles 
oversized regular clothes wont fit properly because they 
arent designed to compensate for a larger stomach and are likely to 
hike up 
choose your regular size in maternity lines 
dont buy too much for one occasion balance the wardrobe 
between business and weekend wear 
try support pantyhose to reduce leg discomfort during pregnancy 
a maternity slip or petticoat will make clothes drape better 
and give you a smoother silhouette 
tops should be long enough to cover your stomach derriere and 
hips 
natural fibers such as cotton wool and some rayons will be 
most comfortable 
dont buy everything at once space your purchases carefully 
buying special occasion clothes when and if you need them allow for 
impulse shopping late in your pregnancy

when actress and model pamela ann martin suffered a disabling 
spinal stroke she spent a year in a hospital flat on her back but 
she still managed to get to a shopping mall on a stretcher to follow 
her passion for fashion 
i was the only person shopping for clothes from a horizontal 
position recalls the vivacious brunette who graduated from 
californias brooks college with a degree in fashion merchandising 
and design 
a physical therapy counselor encouraged pamela to become a 
computer programmer or a keypunch operator but that was much too 
uncreative she says adding 
i told them i was going to hollywood to study acting they 
laughed 
but now more than a decade after her stroke the 35yearold ms 
martins determination has paid off with wheelchair appearances in 
several television dramas feature films and national talk shows 
she also writes a column rolling with laughter and recently 
created the cartoon feature wheelies 
her modeling gigs have been mainly in behalf of everest amp 
jennings a californiabased firm that produces avenues a 
catalog line of fashionable clothing with hidden features to speed 
dressing for wheelchair users 
people who are disabled deserve to have a positive fashion 
image says pamela whose modeling endeavors began at the age of 
6 i did fashion shows for charity and social events throughout my 
schoolgirl and college days 
now the biggest difference between my ability and disability is 
that i model on wheels instead of in heels 
most people just jump in their clothes and zip theyre off 
but for me getting dressed can be a major project 
often she points out conventional clothing doesnt fit or look 
attractive on people who spend their day sitting jackets are too 
long and too binding when propelling a sheelchair slacks are too 
short and pockets are out of reach skirts drag and get caught in 
wheels 
designers of clothes for wheelchair users should develop patterns 
which flatter the seated figure according to clothing consultants 
to create clothing for special needs you must use design to 
solve problems explains dr naomi reich chairman of the 
university of arizonas clothing and textiles department that 
requires analysis 
research and testing indicate that such clothing should be cut 
with extra fabric in the seat and less in the front 
other touches can include thigh pockets or hidden calf pockets 
for keeping glasses keys and other items within easy reach and 
some pants can have hidden ankletoknee zippers to speed dressing 
and accommodate braces 
according to gret atkins of cornell universitys department of 
textiles and apparel clothing can be as much a barrier to 
wheelchair users as a curb without a curb cut 
sometimes dressing can be so exhausting that they might choose 
to stay in their nightwear and not go out or invite someone over 
she says were such a visual society that most disabling 
conditions whether an artificial limb uneven gait or wheelchair 
call attention to themselves 
if clothing draws further attention to disabilities then we 
have failed as designers

computerization in the garment industry has 
given new meaning to the term software make that softwear and 
apparel design students at cornell university are now learning to 
design and cut patterns on machines similar to the ones they will be 
using as professionals 
a computer program normally used by architects and engineers 
autocad has been adapted to work with the soft lines and design 
requirements of clothing this microcomputer more affordable than 
the huge computer systems in large apparel firms enables students 
to carry out the entire garment design process from preliminary 
sketches to pattern layouts or markers 
traditional paper pattern making requires slow meticulous 
cutting and taping lisa gedzelman a senior apparel design student 
from chappaqua ny says the computer eases this job revisions 
to my skirt and shortsleeve jacket outfit that would normally call 
for recutting the pattern by hand were quick and easy on the 
computer 
the computers were installed in l988 with a grant from project 
ezra an 8 million ibm program providing computers for use by 
cornell 
probably eight to 10 schools are making their first use of 
autocad in apparel design courses but cornell may be the only one 
that is taking the designs to the garment stage says anita 
racine senior lecturer in the textiles and apparel department who 
teaches the class in computeraided design

if its not as comfortable as an old shoe dont buy the new one 
so says geof bloom whose company makes hush puppies footwear 
when youre shopping for fall shoes remember any shoe that 
doesnt fit properly will cause some degree of pain he says 
he offers these tips for shoe shoppers 
shop for shoes in midafternoon when your feet have swollen to 
their normal maximum 
wear appropriate hosiery or socks the same type you plan to 
wear with the shoes 
postpone shopping if your feet hurt you wont be able to tell 
if its the new pair that is uncomfortable 
try on both shoes the left foot usually is larger than the 
right 
try shoes by fit not size different styles may fit 
differently if in doubt try the next size up the shoe may be only 
a sixth of an inch longer but that small margin can prove to be 
what makes it wearable 
be aware of the difference between snug and tight a 
snug shoe may stretch a bit and mold to the foot in use but dont 
expect to break in a shoe that pinches or cramps 
stand up on your full weight and see if you can wiggle your 
toes there should be at least a halfinch space in front of your 
longest toe 
make sure the widest part of your foot sits in the widest part 
of the shoe this will let the shoe and foot bend together 
walk as hard and fast as you do normally when trying on shoes 
make several circuits around the shop or department 
test the shoes at home after youve purchased them walk around 
the house on hard floors for at least five minutes to judge if the 
shoes feel as comfortable as they did on the stores soft carpeting 
if they dont remember that as long as you havent worn the shoes 
outdoors you can return them to the store for a better fit

if your past experience with permanent waving left you with a 
wild and woolly cap and a feeling that your hair would crumble if 
you put a comb to it you might try one of the new perms that offer 
less drastic results or nonpermanent permanents 
a line of home permanents epic waves depends on a milder 
chemical formula that gives the user the options to try on a 
perm temporarily better control and the ability to reperm often 
developed by gillette the line is formulated with a 
proteinbuilding amino acid cysteine which with ammonium 
bisulfites only partially restructures hair regular permanents use 
chemicals that completely break down the molecular structure of hair 
and rebuild it again 
our consumer research shows that the three biggest fears women 
have about home perming are lack of control longterm commitment 
and damage to hair by frequent perming says mary ann pesce 
marketing director for gilletes hair care products 
the company says its tryon perm is the first temporary home 
permanent product aimed at the firsttime user it fades away 
within two weeks leaving hair with slightly more body adaptable 
perm lets the user control the level of curl she can wait up to two 
days for the curl to relax before locking in it with a finishing 
rinse or if she still isnt satisfied she can skip the finishing 
rinse and let the hair return to its original form anytime perm can 
be used without damage up to nine times a year for those who like 
frequent reperming other processes like coloring can be used the 
same day as the permanents

hairstyles this fall will be softer and more natural looking 
says the man who calls himself xenon the international creative 
director for the helene curtis professional division 
women are realizing that subtlety can be sexy he says and 
are returning to the simple elegant styling of the 30s and 40s 
this seasons hottest looks will definitely be more styled than 
before 
hair will be worn shoulder length or longer or quite short 
with few variations in between he says 
he envisions longer hairstyles worn gently waved and full on the 
sides by day pulled back into sleek french twists for evening 
shorter hair will be smaller and less spiky than before 
following the shape of the head in a caplike fashion 
bangs will remain an element for styles of all lengths he says

go vest young man is the styling advice coming this fall from 
some mens fashion designers who note that even president bush 
wears a brocade vest with his tuxedo on some occasions 
vests are a strong item in all kinds of fabrications and 
stylings and with details like leather buttons says randy 
ronning mens fashion director at jc penney co inc we expect 
vests to be 25 percent of our sweater business 
ronning feels the return of the vest as a way to invigorate the 
wardrobe is part of a trend toward a more relaxed sophistication in 
menswear favored by both european and american designers 
some fashion experts describe it as a new direction of easy 
elegance meaning a more casual approach to tailored clothing and a 
dressier angle on sportswear 
this could add up to the relaxed look of a knit sweater vest worn 
with a business suit or the dressy flair of a fancy brocade vest 
coupled with a sports jacket and casual pants or a colorful 
cardigan vest with jeans and a sports shirt 
designer henry grethel for whom sweater dressing has become a 
signature offers a fall sportswear collection that features the 
solid or patterned cardigan vest 
under a sportcoat or over a woven shirt the cardigan vest 
boasts an air of gentility suggests a grethel publicist the 
button shawl collar makes a comeback and the classic cabledesign 
mock turtleneck sweater is ever present 
liz claiborne another designer noting a trend of pattern mixing 
with colliding colors has a weekender collection described as 
rugged and relaxed with an emphasis on tops outerwear and american 
indian motifs a key item is the oiled cowhide jacket cut sleek 
and sporty 
as often happens when it comes to fashions however there is not 
complete unanimity among the experts 
concerning vested interest for example playboy magazines 
fashion consultant said recently threepiece suits the ones with 
vests have definitely gone out of styleunless the fall season 
brings a resurgence of this style you should retire your vests and 
stick to wearing the two other pieces of your suit

women in weight control programs should pay just as much 
attention to their appearance as their idealweight sisters says 
the fashion editor of weight watchers magazine 
its important for a woman to have stylish goodlooking 
clothes while shes in the transition phases says lisa goldstein 
whose magazine targets women who are trying to improve their 
appearance through weight control 
goldstein says that the notion that larger women shouldnt wear 
patterned clothing is unfair one of our september fashion pages 
features a woman wearing a cardigan in a bold argyle pattern and it 
looks exactly right 
wellchosen accessories also will help the overweight women feel 
and look better a wellplaced bracelet or necklace helps

among unusual fashion ideas is the possibility of changing eye 
color with tinted contact lenses 
think of the possibilities says a representative of the 
american optometric association you can change the color of your 
eyes to match the outfit you are wearing as easily as you can change 
your bag or shoes 
most optometrists prescribe lenses tinted by the manufacturer 
but some may do the tinting themselves in their offices 
consumers have a choice of soft lenses soft extendedwear lenses 
or rigid gaspermeable lenses in a variety of tints according to 
dr james boucher of laramie wyo chairman of the associations 
contact lens section 
that poses a problem for some wearers he cautions explaining 
sometimes the lens that will not compromise your eye health and 
will give you the best vision and most comfortable fit doesnt come 
in a tint 
in those cases i recommend going with a clear lens having the 
best vision possible and good eye health is what matters most

margaret gregory was dipping into her savings so deeply she was 
afraid shed be forced to sell her condominium and move into an 
apartment 
im 84 years old come august and i was using up my savings 
because i didnt think i was going to live so long and then i 
didnt realize what i was going to live on said mrs gregory a 
retired social worker 
her solution was a reverse mortgage on her san diego condominium 
the opposite of a standard home mortgage instead of building equity 
as she pays the bank each month the company pays her each month as 
her equity drops 
the financial tool is available from three companies a handful 
of states have offered publicly funded or backed programs and the 
federal housing administration this month is launching a pilot 
program with 2500 insured reverse mortgages available nationally 
one way to think about this is there are nearly 19 million 
elderly households in the country eightythree percent of them own 
their own home and 73 percent of the owners own their homes free and 
clear said judith may the chief architect of the fha program 
yet at the same time 17 million elderly owners have houses worth 
more than 50000 and annual income below 10000 
in other words they could be described as house rich and cash 
poor and they could be candidates for reverse mortgages 
to encourage a test of the offerings the fha program set to 
begin july 24 allows selected lenders almost every option ever 
thought up 
borrowers 62 and older can choose from a lifetime reverse 
mortgage one that lasts a specific number of years one that offers 
a line of credit or a combination interest can be either fixed or 
adjustable homeowners can pledge 100 percent of their equity or any 
portion appreciation in home values can be factored in no matter 
which options are selected homeowners can stay at home until they 
move sell or die at that point the lender gets the full amount of 
equity that was pledged even if it wasnt all used 
mrs gregory long divorced and with no children had maintained 
a private practice in psychotherapy until last year she had been 
living on her social security and was spending her savings 
the reverse mortgage on her 135000 condo is with the 
providential home income plan based in san francisco she pledged 60 
percent of equity and gets about 500 a month as long as she lives 
to help meet a 1300 monthly budget providential will be repaid 
the full 60 percent when she dies 
its a lifetime program so the longer you live the more 
benefit you get from it if i should die in the next day or two 
they would get the benefit of my estate but if i can live six years 
or more i will get the benefit 
her 78yearold sister in nearby carlsbad now is getting one 
herself 
its very good it really solves my problems mrs gregory 
said in a year or two id probably have to sell the house and 
find some other living arrangement that would be cheaper i didnt 
want to move 
the same thoughts were expressed by some of the 3500 older 
americans who have opted for reverse mortgages 
the typical borrower has been about 75 years of age about 
twothirds single women living alone 25 percent elderly couples 
their average income has been below 10000 for women and below 
14000 for couples ms may said she believes the fha offers the 
best deal for those with homes worth 150000 or less higher values 
would bring higher benefits from private plans 
the maximum payout on fha loans is tied to age interest and the 
form and amount of the loan a 75yearold widow with a 100000 
debtfree house would qualify for 812 a month on a fiveyear 
fixedterm reverse mortgage at 10 percent interest with no 
appreciationsharing 
florida is about to kick off a program but outsiders are 
critical it only offers term mortgages people must be 70 or older 
to apply payments go down if interest rates go up and lenders will 
be allowed to claim contents from an estate other than the house if 
payments exceed equity 
lenders and experts familiar with the program have been critical 
and administrator rodney roberts said the sponsor is reexamining 
the 70year age limit there will be improvements to this program 
there will be improvements to all of the others 
other state programs operate in connecticut and rhode island in 
virginia the program was so popular the fund was exhausted 
maryland is launching one and pennsylvania and north carolina are 
developing programs 
american homestead mortgage corp of mount laurel nj the 
largest private lender has written more than 2500 reverse 
mortgages since 1983 and now operates in eight states and the 
district of columbia 
capital holding corp of louisville ky introduced its product 
in october and providential wrote its first loan in november 
seniors are a little cautious about doing something this big 
and it is a big deal said capital holding spokeswoman tricia 
snoke we encourage them to talk to financial advisers talk to 
their children talk to their banker 
would you call it the wave of the future no maybe a ripple 
the likelihood is its going to remain fairly small said ken 
scholen director of the national center of home equity conversion 
in madison wis and generally recognized as the grandfather of 
reverse mortgages 
a year ago we were looking at maybe a dozen states a year 
from now itll be probably 33 states in five years all 50 
states

like the storybook awakening of rip van winkle who 
found hed slept into old age western european nations are 
discovering what it means to lose their youth 
parts of europe already have the worlds highest populations of 
elderly people and governments are recognizing the change 
especially in the fasteraging north where retirees may comprise 40 
percent of some populations by 2040 from west germany to greece 
countries are studying how fewer young people will support strained 
pension and health care systems 
but gloomy visions of crowded oldage homes and broken economies 
are out of line experts say they worry about the poor and lonely 
but say most will be comfortable with money to spend as 
advertisers have already noticed 
the challenge experts say will be to show society that age 
doesnt mean illness or empty lives no americanstyle gray panthers 
have appeared to defend the cause but a british seniors group is 
fighting age discrimination 
europe is in the position to be the first to enter a new social 
world so what we decide to do is of great importance only now is 
anybody taking any notice of it says peter laslett a cambridge 
university demographer and expert on aging 
we cant look at it simply in terms of a burden says 
laslett 73 who likes to lace demographic data with lines from 
wordsworth on the joys of youth its an enormous challenge for 
human beings for the first time to use their whole potential 
demographers say that while the developing world will catch up 
quickly europe has more than twice the global proportion of 
elderly or 124 percent and northern europe has 25 times the 
world average southern europe with its higher birthrates is aging 
less rapidly by the year 2000 every fourth person will be over 65 
in western europe by one estimate 
the main reasons are lifeenhancing medicine and falling 
birthrates and some say europe has been slow to recognize the 
magnitude of the change 
were waking up to it late in the day says sally greengross 
secretarygeneral of eurolink age a coalition promoting the cause 
of the 60 million over60s in the european economic community 
france forbids forced retirement and job advertisements arent 
allowed to set age limits but other nations says eurolink age 
have yet to follow suit 
the 12nation eec plans a year of the elderly but red tape 
has postponed it to 1991 the eec budget for elderly affairs more 
than doubled in 1988 but only to the equivalent of 738000 
pensions are of primary concern prompted by fears of future 
workers paying hefty proportions of their salaries to support 
pensioners 
west germany estimates 40 percent of its population will be over 
65 by 2040 and its employers federation says employees would have 
to pay 36 percent of their salaries or double todays rate to 
sustain benefits 
the west german cabinet has proposed reforms including hiking 
the retirement age for women from 60 to 65 the age at which men 
retire italy is considering similar action most eec citizens can 
receive retirement benefits at 60 or 65 danes work the latest to 
67 and italian women leave at 55 
british prime minister margaret thatchers government has acted 
to abolish a 130 weekly limit on what pensioners can earn before 
losing some benefits at the same time it has been criticized for 
cutting pensions as part of what the government calls weaning 
britons off the dependency culture 
the elderly increasingly contribute to the economy by filling in 
for the shrinking numbers of the young already some are being 
wooed back by employers like britains tesco supermarket chain 
which hires 55 to 69yearolds 
theyre very reliable conscientious and dont need so much 
training says barry ball the personnel manager who began tescos 
scheme a year ago 
im not ready for retirement work keeps me young says 
doris broderick 58 who started working in a tesco market coffee 
shop six months ago after being laid off from serving coffee to 
lloyds shipping staff 
success after sixty a british employment agency for over50s 
reported a 60percent jump in requests from companies in the first 
two months of 1989 compared with the same period last year 
but prejudice still keeps many from working says the association 
of retired persons a british group based on the american 
association of retired persons arp which has signed up 25000 
members in eight months hopes to expand to france and germany 
the elderly are just beginning to organize in france said 
ariane revolbriard of frances 8yearold ministry for the elderly 
in germany a politician recently suggested a political party for 
those 60 and over 
southern european countries on the other hand have less use for 
older workers spain with 19 percent unemployment is studying a 
plan to offer tax breaks to companies which retire older workers 
early 
in the health field europeans are turning to home care to reduce 
strain on care systems and promote independence says anthea tinker

missionary school in china and the english teacher there encouraged 
me it went to my head and ive been writing ever since 
born in japan to american parents who later lived in the 
philippines and china miss whitney saw the united states for the 
first time at age 15 after her father died and her mother returned 
home her mother died three years later and the teenager moved in 
with an aunt in chicago 
i did everything i worked in bookstores and libraries read 
manuscripts and lectured she said of her ongoing attraction to 
writing 
she eventually landed a job as childrens book editor for the 
chicago sun and later had a similar job with the philadelphia 
inquirer all the while writing hundreds of short stories many of 
which did not sell 
her first hardcover success came in 1941 with a place for 
ann a book for teenagers miss whitney wrote three dozen novels 
including 20 mysteries for young people before settling in as a 
writer of adult mysteries with the publication of the quicksilver 
pool in 1955 
among the international bestsellers that followed were feather 
on the moon silversword flaming tree dream of 
orchids rainsong and emerald more than 50 million copies 
of her books are available in the united states and 18 foreign 
countries according to her publisher doubleday and all of her 
adult novels are still in print 
some critics have classified miss whitneys work as romantic 
suspense but she rejects that label its mystery suspense a 
whitney kind of book 
indeed rainbow in the mist about a clairvoyant who helps 
solve one womans murder and anothers disappearance has only a 
whisper of romance 
the protagonist in rainbow as in all miss whitneys books 
is a woman thats the point of view i have i feel more 
comfortable with it 
miss whitney herself was way ahead of talk of womens 
liberation ive always been a liberated woman i kept my own name 
through two marriages 
miss whitney maintains a rigid sixday work schedule i get to 
my desk by 9 and work until noon the creative process begins 
before she sits down at the typewriter she shuns a word processor 
because i couldnt think with all those mechanical things to do 
after lunch she exercises with a brisk walk on the deck that 
surrounds her home then takes a nap shes back at work at 2 pm 
and calls it a day at 5 
her time away from research and writing is as carefully scheduled 
as her work days her recreation consists of dinner out and a movie 
on saturday nights with her daughter and soninlaw who live 
nearby and watching murder she wrote on television on sunday 
nights i dont have much social life i like people but they can 
be distracting writers have to be disciplined 
her books have been so successful because i tell a good story 
i offer optimism all my books have happy endings i dont see any 
point in letting my readers down at the end im an optimist 
people feel that in my books 
miss whitney seems to radiate that quality her youthful spirit 
and zest for life belying her age 
im not old she said i dont have time to die

most people when planning for their future or for an unforeseen 
illness think only of ensuring that their financial affairs are in 
order it is equally important to protect the right to make 
healthcare decisions 
competent adults may consent to or refuse any medical treatment 
that is proposed but suppose they lack the capacity or are no 
longer able to make a determination about the treatment who would 
make that decision in some cases doctors would turn to family 
members or they might go to court to ask that a guardian be 
appointed to make medical decisions the simplest most effective 
way is to give directions in advance about who has authority to 
decide and about what treatment is wanted or not wanted 
living wills are the most common document used to plan for future 
medical care forty states have statutes recognizing living will 
declarations a living will gives directions about the medical 
treatment you do or do not want in the event you are terminally ill 
and unable to make treatment decisions or give directions to 
doctors it also names the person you decide should carry out your 
wishes or should act on your behalf 
there are limitations to the use of living wills because they 
can be used only when a person is terminally ill and death is 
imminent they do not help incompetent patients who are not 
terminal if the treatment in question is not lifeprolonging 
it also may not be covered 
thus a living will is not effective for an alzheimers patient 
who needs some medical treatment such as a cataract operation but 
is unable to give the necessary medical consent to the operation 
many states prohibit implementation of the declaration if the 
patient is pregnant others exclude certain types of care from those 
that the patient may request to be withheld or withdrawn 
in the past powers of attorney were used for financial matters 
the person giving the power the principal designates someone else 
the attorney in fact or agent to make business and financial 
decisions for him or her sell real estate invest money sign a 
business contract 
traditionally the principal had to be competent the power of 
attorney terminated upon the principals incapacity or death 
however under current law a power of attorney can be durable 
and endure or continue in effect even if the principal is 
incompetent more important states now recognize that the powers 
conferred by a durable power of attorney may include the authority 
to make health care decisions on behalf of the principal 
a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisionmaking is a 
more versatile document than a living will declaration it can be 
used for all medical decisions not just those about lifeprolonging 
treatment and by all people not just those who are terminally ill 
in the example given above if the alzheimers patient while 
competent had executed a durable power of attorney authorizing 
someone to make healthcare decisions the person named in the 
document would be able to consent to or refuse the cataract 
operation 
durable powers of attorney can be used to request that 
lifesustaining treatment be continued or to request that such 
treatment including food and water be withheld or withdrawn most 
important they allow you to say who should be responsible for 
making healthcare decisions if you are not able to do so 
while only some states have specific laws about medical durable 
powers of attorney all states recognize their use each state has 
its own requirements about who may be named the agent to make the 
medical decisions who may witness the document and the form the 
document should take states have similar requirements for living 
wills 
a durable power of attorney for healthcare decisionmaking is a 
necessary document to protect your right to make healthcare 
decisions even if you are incapacitated simply executing a will or 
signing a durable power of attorney directed to business and 
financial matters will not ensure that this right continues past 
your incapacity

iraqs 15 billion oil pipeline across 
saudi arabia to the red sea will open on schedule in september 
significantly boosting its export capacity the middle east economic 
survey reported monday 
however iraq said it would adhere to its organization of 
petroleum exporting countries production quota of 2783 million 
barrels a day despite its increased capacity 
the respected oil industry weekly quoted an unidentified senior 
iraqi oil source as saying that delays caused by a fourmonth strike 
at south koreas hyundai engineering and construction co which was 
producing units for an offshore terminal have been absorbed 
the strike which ended in april had triggered speculation that 
the opening of the 56inch 580mile pipeline would be delayed until 
the end of the year 
the pipeline will link into another pipeline that runs from 
iraqs southern port of elzubair it was built along with pipelines 
through turkey during the iraniraq war when baghdads vital oil 
export routes through the gulf were cut off 
the offshore terminal in the red sea will be able to handle 
tankers of up to 400000 tons at least one of three planned loading 
berths will now be ready by september the newsletter reported 
the pipeline is being built by italys saipem co for a 
consortium that includes japans mitsubishi heavy industries and 
mitsubish corp italys snamprogetti and frances spie capag co 
ipsa2 as the pipeline is called will have an initial capacity 
of around 800000 barrels a day with full capacity of 165 million 
barrels a day early next year mees reported 
with export capacity from the southern elbakr terminal on the 
persian gulf expected to rise to 2 million barrels a day next year 
iraqs production capacity should reach an estimated 45 million 
barrels a day next year 
oil minister issam abdul alchalabi sad last month that war 
damage to the albakr platform a deep water terminal has been 
repaired 
the weekly newsletter reported that iraqs oil policy was based 
on iraqs desire to maximize revenue and stabilize prices rather 
than a maximization of production and price competition 
baghdad also prefers strategic flexibility to give the country 
the necessary options after its experience in the gulf war when at 
one point only the turkish pipeline with less than 1 million 
barrels a day capacity was in operation

by year end toyota management expects the georgetown plant to 
make 800 cars a day 200000 a year this past week the first 
shift was producing 400 a day while the second shift was making 275

were not as worried about the numbers as we are the quality 
he said 
hiring at the plant is complete and the new employees trained

time working on their own each day in midjune the two shifts were 
completely split

shift works from 515 pm to 215 am hiring for the second shift 
began in january and ended two weeks ago

workers on the line for each shift warren said 
hiring for the powertrain plant where engines axles and 
steering components will be assembled will continue through the 
end of 1990 by then the two plants could employ as many as 3500

british rail train drivers began an overtime ban 
and dockworkers said they would strike at midnight on monday in 
what threatens to be the worst week of industrial unrest in prime 
minister margaret thatchers 10 years in power 
more than 500000 town hall staff throughout britain planned a 
48hour strike for tuesday and wednesday and unions said the 
national rail service and londons subway system would again grind 
to a halt on wednesday 
british rail said 120 of its 500 morning rush hour trains were 
canceled in its busy southern region surrounding london because of 
the overtime ban by the 17500 members of the associated society of 
locomotive engineers and firemen 
a spokesman said one in three scheduled trains did not arrive 
monday morning at waterloo station londons main rail station south 
of the river thames and 17 percent of trains were not running into 
central londons victoria station 
leaders of all three railways unions the engineers the national 
union of railwaymen and the transport and salaried staffs 
association were scheduled to meet monday to discuss their disputes 
with british rail over pay and bargaining arrangements 
british rail has imposed a 7percent pay raise on the transport 
and salaried staffs association which represents 30000 white 
collar workers 
the railway staff national tribunal the industrys arbitration 
body has recommended that it be increased to 88 percent closer to 
the national average wage settlement of 93 percent the association 
is the only one of the three rail unions to participate in the 
tribunal 
if british rail approves the tribunals recommendation it must 
then decide whether to offer the 88 percent increase to all its 
130000 employees 
general secretary jimmy knapp of the national unions of 
railwaymen has already said that 88 percent is way below the 
target we are seeking his union is seeking a 10percent raise 
the transport and general workers union said 9400 dockworkers 
would begin an indefinite strike at midnight monday over the 
abolition of a scheme which guaranteed them jobs for life 
employers fear the disruption at 40 ports could hurt exports and 
imports and worsen the countrys merchandise trade deficit 
a yearlong strike by britains miners in 198485 was far more 
bitter than any of the current disputes but had less impact on 
individual britons 
in this summers mounting labor unrest strikes have regularly 
closed passport offices idled londons red doubledecker buses and 
blacked out programs on the british broadcasting corp 
north sea oil workers are involved in rotating strikes over pay 
and safety and ambulance workers and water industry workers have 
scheduled votes on industrial action 
the five million london commuters who rely on trains and subways 
will have to find other transportation on wednesday if as planned 
london underground workers stage their 10th stoppage in 14 weeks and 
british rail is shut down for the fourth time in four weeks 
the subway workers want a 64pound or 104 a week raise to 
operate trains without guards management has offered 30 pounds or 
49 plus extra vacation but is demanding increased productivity 
the department of employment said 256000 working days have been 
lost due to strikes this year up to april the latest month for 
which figures are available nearly 30 million working days were 
lost during the 1979 winter of discontent which helped mrs thatcher 
sweep to power

harsh 
the plan also envisions cutting back drastically on government 
spending selling off many staterun industries scaling back 
subsidies and tax breaks for private companies and enforcing widely 
ignored tax laws 
we have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia if not 
argentina has no future said president carlos menem who on 
saturday took over this country where runaway inflation has provoked 
food riots this year 
in another development menem on sunday suggested argentina and 
britain temporarily set aside their claims to the falkland islands 
and discuss resuming diplomatic relations 
in london the british labor party today urged the conservative 
government to take up the offer 
a statement by the british foreign office said it was examining 
what menem said at his inauguration it said if the argentines are 
moving toward excluding sovereignty from discussions on rusuming 
diplomatic ties then the prospect for progress may be opening 
up 
britain and argentina went to war in 1982 over the islands 350 
miles off the argentine coast which britain has ruled since 1833 
diplomatic ties have remained broken ever since 
in the economic address on sunday night roig told reporters he 
expects the countrys 31 million people to begin feeling the results 
of the austerity measures in 2 years 
gasoline prices went up 6105 percent from 152 to 1080 australs 
per gallon or about 23 cents to 165 electricity and telephone 
fees rose by about 200 percent the government news agency telam 
said 
natural gas prices will rise 640 percent for businesses 200 
percent for homeowners roig did not say when the new rates would 
take effect 
hefty fare increases for buses subways commuter trains and 
airplanes will take effect july 17 government spokesmen said the 
rates were not announced 
beginning today the austral will sell for 655 per dollar 
bringing its value in line with the black market and intending to 
encourage exporters to sell foreign currency to the central bank 
which has low cash reserves 
the official rate on friday was 303 to the dollar the 
devaluation amounted to 537 percent 
the measures are aimed at curtailing inflation that in june 
soared by 1145 percent and narrowing a budget deficit estimated at 
12 percent to 15 percent of the gross national product 
the two are linked the former government of president raul 
alfonsin financed the deficit caused in large part by operating 
losses at staterun companies by printing money or borrowing 
abroad 
neither avenue is open to menem who was elected may 14 the 
nation is 45 billion in arrears in interest payments on the 60 
billion foreign debt and inflation is out of control 
the projected 12month cost of living increase based on junes 
rate amounts to a staggering 948597 percent the austral valued at 
18 per 1 in february has lost 97 percent of its value in five 
months 
inflation and devaluation touched off a recession in which real 
wages have fallen by at least 35 percent this year and unemployment 
has climbed to 10 percent 
workers would be shielded somewhat from the effects of the new 
measures by controls on the prices of milk bread and other basic 
commodities and a small onetime pay increase this month roig 
said the pay increase which will go to salaried workers and 
retirees amounts to 8000 australs about 12 
the danger is more social unrest labor unions denounced price 
hikes in the past weeks and hungry shantytown dwellers looted food 
stores again last week in rosario the countrys thirdlargest city 
roig said the only solution was a free market policy where the 
private sector would provide services now offered by the government 
legislation will be sent to congress to give menem sweeping 
authority to privatize state companies roig said state subsidies 
to private companies tax breaks reduced rates for energy soft 
loans will be scaled back and tax laws enforced

a 1 billionplus tax claim against nelson 
bunker hunt and william herbert hunt could consume what remains of 
the tycoons inheritance from fabled texas oil wildcatter hl hunt 
a trial that began today in us tax court pitting the hunts 
against the internal revenue service could determine whether the 
brothers will have any money left to repay their other creditors in 
us bankruptcy court 
once billionaires bunker now lists his assets at 25883 million 
and herbert says hes worth 16938 million according to documents 
filed in bankruptcy court in dallas as part of their chapter 11 
reorganization 
the irs has claims totaling 701 million in disputed taxes and 
interest against bunker and 317 million against herbert todays 
case involves only the 1982 tax year and claims of 150 million each 
against the two brothers 
attorneys in the case expect the nonjury trial before us tax 
court judge jules g korner iii to last about three to four weeks 
as a priority creditor in the bankruptcy case the governments 
claim moves ahead of most others when the hunts assets are divided 
up 
the hunts dont have enough money to pay everybody our claim 
might eat up every penny that they have said grover hartt an 
attorney in the justice departments tax division 
we have claims in excess of 1 billion in the aggregate for 
both brothers said hartt who is monitoring the governments 
claim the largest single part of that is the 1982 tax year 
the trials outcome could affect irs claims affecting other 
years hartt said friday from dallas the hunts and the irs are 
disputing taxes owed in several years between 1974 and 1988 
the dispute over the 1982 taxes centers on the dissolution of 
what the hunts contend was a partnership created to repay the 
brothers debts from the 1980 silver price collapse the irs claims 
the partnership actually was a loan the hunts did not repay and 
thus constitutes taxable income 
in a separate case the commodity futures trading commission 
alleges that the hunts and other international businessmen were 
involved in a pricefixing scheme to corner the world silver market 
in court documents the commission claims that had the scheme not 
collapsed by the end of may 1980 they could have owned virtually 
the entire world supply of deliverable 999 silver bullion 
the 1982 tax case also involves a third brother lamar hunt 
lamar who is not in bankruptcy court with his brothers is 
contesting about 500000 in taxes 
the government has listed as trial exhibits some 1300 documents 
filling four boxes attorneys say with several hundred more filed 
by the hunts cadre of lawyers 
on the witness list are the three hunt brothers their sisters 
margaret hunt hill and caroline rose hunt a nephew and a cousin 
and experts on coal and silver 
michael henke an attorney representing bunker and herbert hunt 
said the partnership darn sure was a partnership and not a sham 
as the government contends 
henke said the hunts contributed substantial assets to the 
partnership including stocks in gold mining companies worth more 
than 100 million and 294 million in coal properties the 
partnership also received 825 million out of a 11 billion bank 
loan to placid oil co which is controlled by six hunt trusts 
including those of the three brothers 
there was no taxable income as a result of the partnerships 
dissolution henke said

about 2000 plywood workers at five 
georgiapacific plants in arkansas and mississippi went on strike 
this morning after the breakdown of contract talks about overtime 
pay 
the walkout forced the temporary shutdown of the mills 
a georgiapacific spokesman said the strike involves about 1000 
union workers at mills in crossett and fordyce in arkansas and a 
roughly equal number of workers at mills in louisville taylorsville 
and gloster miss the plants belong to georgiapacifics 
midcontinent division 
workers at crossett and gloster are represented by the 
international woodworkers of america workers at fordyce 
louisville and taylorsville are members of the united brotherhood of 
carpenters and joiners 
union and company negotiators had continued talks past two 
deadlines following the june 1 expiration of the old contract but 
the unions rejected the companys latest offer wednesday and pickets 
went up at the mills about 5 am today 
the plants manufacture southern pine plywood for residential and 
commercial construction spokesman terry hadaway at the crossett 
plant said the company would shut down the plants at least 
temporarily 
the plans are currently to conduct orderly shutdown of each of 
those operations beyond that were evaluating the circumstances to 
determine what our next action will be hadaway said today he 
would not speculate on how long the plants would be idled nor would 
he detail the contract dispute 
union officials said the companys latest offer called for a 
fouryear contract with pay increases of 2 percent the first 
second and fourth years of the pact and 3 percent the third year 
the unions wanted a threeyear contract with pay increases of 3 
percent each year 
but the unions main concern was over the companys proposal to 
pay workers regular wages for working on sunday and dropping time 
andahalf wages paid under the old contract the company offered 
sunday workers a onetime bonus of 800 to 1000 
steve price president of iwa local 5475 in crossett said the 
loss of sunday premium pay would cost maintenance workers about 
2300 a year and would mean about 1400 in lost wages for utility 
employees also he said about 30 percent of workers at the 
crossett plant dont work on sunday and would not get the bonus 
minimum hourly pay at the plants is 790 price said 
the strike marks the second time in four years that 
georgiapacific workers have walked off the job members of the 
united paperworkers union staged a threemonth strike in 1985

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower 
in early trading today on the chicago board of trade weighed down 
by forecasts for increasing chances of rain in the midwestern corn 
belt as the week progresses 
the corn market opened with unexpectedly sharp losses despite a 
weekend of extremely hot mostly dry weather in most growing areas 
i think the main impact here is the chance of rain said 
william biedermann a vice president and director of research with 
allendale inc a futures brokerage based in crystal lake ill 
the wheat market was modestly lower in response to 
betterthanexpected yields of winter wheat harvesting of the crop 
is nearing completion in the great plains 
the main event in the grain markets this week should be the 
agriculture departments report on corn and soybean plantings which 
is scheduled for release after the close of trading on wednesday 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 403 a bushel corn was 4 cents to 
4 cents lower with july at 269 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 
5 cents lower with july at 153 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents 
lower to 2 cents higher with july at 769 a bushel

chase manhattan bank lowered its prime lending 
rate by a half percentage point to 105 percent today the second 
such reduction in as many months 
other major commercial banks were expected to follow suit in 
cutting the rate which is a benchmark used to set interest on a 
variety of consumer and business credit 
the decrease which was effective immediately had been widely 
expected and comes amid building perception in the financial markets 
that the federal reserve is seeking looser credit policies in 
response to a slowdown in economic growth 
shortterm interest rates in the bond market have been falling 
steadily as a result 
bond and stock prices were moderatly higher following todays 
announcement while the dollar was little changed 
if the current interest rates scenario continues it will 
benefit a lot of people especially those looking to buy a 
house said kevin flanagan a money market economist with dean 
witter reynolds inc 
because the prime rate reflects a banks costs of borrowing 
money including interest it pays on savings accounts or 
certificates of deposit it trails more subtle increases in other 
interest rates in the credit markets 
still the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a 
basis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many 
types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans mortgage rates 
are not included in that category 
the prime stood at 105 percent at the start of 1989 the banks 
raised it twice in february to 115 percent then lowered a half 
percentage point on june 5 those movements reflected changing 
concerns about economic growth and inflation 
the latest decrease puts the key lending rate at its lowest level 
since feb 10 when it was raised from 105 percent to 11 percent

while recession dulls the roar of the nations 
factories and lessens the rumble of economic activity in general 
you can always hear the hammers and saws 
homeowners see to it for myriad reasons chief among them being 
their love of home sweet home americans continue to change repair 
improve and add to their homes through good times and bad 
since 1970 there have been three recessions in 1974 1979 and 
1982 but only in the most recent and especially severe downturn 
did spending on repairs and improvements falter and then by an 
almost trivial 23 percent 
last year after having risen at a compound annual rate of 115 
percent since 1970 expenditures topped 100 billion and they are 
running at a rate higher than that in 1989 chances are strong they 
will rise next year too 
even when adjusted for inflation says kenneth klein who heads 
the national association of home builders remodeling council it 
remains the fastestgrowing sector of the entire construction 
industry 
with wall street now worrying about another recession it is 
forever rubbing its hands in fear of inflation or in anticipation of 
expansion youll be hearing a lot about the subject in the next 
few weeks 
but while wall street loves the repair and remodeling industry 
because it offers a safe haven in bad times the more interesting 
story is how the industry reflects the persistence of homeowners in 
changing things around 
housing is considered cyclical that is when times are good 
people buy homes most of the homes purchased each year are existing 
homes and these must be adapted to the new owners likes and needs 
out come the hammers and saws 
when times arent so good people tend to forego purchasing 
instead they draw closer to the old hearth they decide to stay 
where they are and fix up to meet their changing needs 
no matter what the economy is doing expanding stagnating 
regressing americans continue to spend on improvements and 
repairs it is in a sense a participant sport although most of 
the dollars are spent with professionals 
involvement with the house goes back a long long way of course 
but two relatively recent factors have helped spur activity 
one is housing inflation it forced new homebuyers to purchase 
houses that were less than their hearts desire and then fix them 
up it caused some existing homeowners to stay where they were and 
put on additions 
for the latter the money came from home equity loans a decade 
ago it was difficult to borrow on the house now it can be as easy 
as writing a check and as most homeowners know to borrow on the 
house is to lower income taxes 
something always seems to develop to abet activity not that 
americans need any spurs the latest appears to be falling interest 
rates and another is already appearing on the distant horizon 
that distant horizon is viewed as gray by many in the housing 
industry simply because a decline is coming in the number of people 
in the mid20s to mid30s considered the prime homebuying ages 
the shrinkage of this segment is expected by itself to result 
in a slight downturn in sales of new homes but passage of the 
population bulge will mean that those who did buy homes in the past 
decade will be thinking differently 
as they age many of them will be earning more wives who had 
been tied down with children eventually will be going back to work 
providing an additional household income family needs and desires 
will be changing 
it means theyll be in the mood to tamper with the house and if 
they dont tamper they might consider selling and that means a new 
owner with ideas of personalizing the house by remodeling 
result more construction music more pounding of hammers and 
screeching of saws

cvn companies inc has agreed to be 
acquired by qvc network inc a smaller competitor in the televised 
home shopping business for more than 400 million in cash and 
stock the companies said today 
the deal would create a company that backers said could better 
compete against the video retailing leader home shopping network 
inc in an industry that generated an estimated 14 billion in 
revenue last year 
the agreement calls for qvc of west chester pa to purchase 
all cvn common stock for 19 a share in cash plus oneeighth of a 
share in qvc common stock 
cvn which operates the cable value network the fashion channel 
and americas shopping channel had about 183 million shares of 
stock outstanding making that cash portion of the deal worth about 
350 million 
the stock portion of the deal would add another 40 million to 
the price of the transaction at recent prices qvc closed at 1788 
a share in national overthercounter trading while cvn closed at 
1875 a share 
cvn also warrants and options outstanding that would add another 
25 million to the value of the deal the companies indicated 
the merger is subject to approval by shareholders of both 
companies as well as securing federal regulatory approval the 
companies said they hoped the deal could be completed in september 
qvc which operates the qvc cable network has arranged for a 
financing commitment of 435 million from the bank of new york it 
has also received a commitment from comcast corp to buy 30 million 
of convertible subordinated debentures 
qvc had net sales of 213 million in the year ended may 31 
substantially smaller than cvns 6378 million in the same period 
however qvc has an exclusive tv agreement to sell sears roebuck 
merchandise 
cvn reported serving some 233 million cable subscribers to 141 
million for qvc 
the combination of qvc and cvn will allow for more effective 
direct marketing efforts which will result in increased subscriber 
acceptance and satisfaction cvn chairman theodore deikel said in 
a statement the combination will also enhance the opportunities 
for longterm growth 
cvn said its board decided that the qvc offer would benefit 
shareholders more than cvns previously announced plan to issue a 
special 10 a share dividend if cvn shareholders approve the 
merger the dividend will be canceled 
after the merger qvc said it intends to continue both companies 
television shopping programs 
qvc said it does not intend to make any substantial changes in 
cvn operations before the end of the year to allow time for teams 
from both companies to evaluate ways to enhance productivity 
joseph m segal qvcs chairman said his company would still 
reach fewer homes with its cvn and qvc shopping programs than home 
shopping network does 
but he said qvc would be able to compete more effectively and 
reach a sales level comparable to hsns if the deal goes through 
because the company would be abler to offer consumers more 
diversified shopping programs and merchandise choices

gold prices were also lower as the market continued to 
consolidate gains from last week dealers said 
last fridays us job figures for june indicating a slowdown in 
the economy came on the heels of other reports that showed sluggish 
growth dealers said this was likely to persuade the federal reserve

investment

corn soybean and oat futures closed sharply lower 
monday on the chicago board of trade in anticipation of cooler 
wetter weather in the midwest 
wheat futures finished moderately lower 
private meteorologists predicted rainfall of inch to 1 inches 
covering 30 percent to 60 percent of the midwestern corn and soybean 
fields by wednesday 
expectations for a bearish midweek crop report prompted further 
selling of corn and soybean futures the agriculture department is 
set to release estimates of planted acreage for those crops after 
the close of trading on wednesday 
private analysts and traders expect the usda report to show 
modest increases in planted acreage since last year but many have 
lowered their expectations because of heavy rains that have made 
planting impossible in parts of the eastern corn belt and the 
southeast 
its one thing to fight weather and another thing to fight 
weather if these acreage reports are gong to be negative said pat 
oconnell a grainmarket analyst in chicago with refco inc 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in july at 399 a bushel corn was 1 cents

texas hunt brothers did the best they could in 
an atmosphere of panic after the silver market collapse in 1980 
their attorney said monday denying at the start of their taxclaim 
trial that they had set up a colossal sham partnershp 
however internal revenue service attorney deborah butler told 
the judge that the partnership was created to provide financial 
relief to the petitioners at a time when they needed it very badly 
and was subject to taxes when it was dissolved in 1982 
michael henke in opening arguments in what is expected to be a 
lengthy trial said the complex partnership created to repay huge 
hunt debts was not subject to 300 million in taxes as the irs says 
two hunt brothers nelson bunker and william herbert are each 
contesting some 150 million in 1982 taxes while lamar hunt is 
contesting about 500000 in taxes the case being tried without a 
jury is expected to last up to a month 
while the 1982 tax year is the sole subject of the trial 
government attorneys have said the outcome could affect other irs 
claims against bunker and herbert in other tax years those claims 
totaling 1 billion in taxes and interest are greater than the 
assets the brothers have listed in us bankruptcy court filings 
because the irs is a priority creditor in bankruptcy court the 
outcome of the tax trial also could determine the size of hunt 
settlements with other creditors in their reorganization under 
bankruptcy law 
in opening arguments monday henke representing bunker and 
herbert hunt argued that the brothers created the partnership with 
placid oil co which is owned by six hunt family trusts to cover 
massive debts from the march 1980 silver price collapse 
the principal issue which this court will be called upon to 
decide is whether the placid investments limited partnership formed 
in 1980 was in fact a bona fide partnership as petitioners 
contend or merely a colossal sham as the irs commissioner in 
effect asserts he said 
the brothers silver problems came to a head henke said at the 
end of march 1980 when they were unable to pay 434 million to 
engelhard corp a new jerseybased precious metals dealer and 
chemical manufacturer they owed the money for silver they had 
agreed to purchase the previous january 
you will hear testimony from petitioner herbert hunt and from 
his cousin tom hunt trustee of one of the trusts owning placid 
that engelhard threatened a lawsuit to pierce the six trusts owning 
placid in order to collect the amount owing to them out of placids 
assets henke told the judge 
you will also hear tom hunts testimony that he told the 
engelhard representatives the hunt brothers would go into bankruptcy 
before they would allow the trusts to be pierced henke said 
since the silver price collapse placid as well as bunker and 
herbert hunt has filed for reorganization under bankruptcy law 
placid the flagship company of the hunts holdings was 
established by their father the legendary oil wildcatter hl hunt 
in 1935 
under the disputed partnership agreement placid contributed cash 
and notes totaling 824 million obtained through a 11 billion 
loan from a consortium of banks 
the hunts contributed silver gold stocks coal properties and 
other assets that henke said had an aggregate gross value of more 
than 1 billion and a net contribution value of approximately 408 
million 
while henke claims the hunts contributed coal properties worth 
294 million in 1980 the irs claims those properties were worth 16 
million and when the partnership was dissolved the irs claims the 
coal properties were worth 6 million compared with hunt claims the 
coal properties were worth 262 million 
henke said the issue for the court to decide is not the precise 
fair market value of the coal properties in 1980 but whether the 
value assigned them was reasonable whether that value reflected 
the sort of attention and care in valuation that the parties to a 
billiondollar partnership would have been expected to exercise 
given the atmosphere of panic and resulting very short time frame 
with which they were faced 
henke said after the court session that the brothers were in a 
rushrush atmosphere to repay their debts because brokerage 
houses faced huge problems and the price of silver could have fallen 
further with the markets going into a state of flux

the dollar declined against several foreign 
currencies monday after a major us commercial bank cut its prime 
lending rate 
gold prices edged up in us trading after posting minor losses 
overseas 
currency dealers sold dollars early in us trading when chase 
manhattan bank announced it was lowering its prime rate by a half 
point to 10 percent 
the reduction effective immediately was expected to cause other 
big banks to lower their primes which are benchmark rates used to 
set interest charges on a variety of consumer and business loans 
as of late monday however chase was the only major bank to 
enact a rate cut a regional midwestern bank had trimmed its key 
rate to 10 percent on friday 
the impact of the chase move was muted because financial markets 
have been anticipating interest rate declines for weeks lower us 
interest rates hurt the dollar by reducing returns on 
dollardenominated investments 
there is a perception in the markets that sluggish economic 
activity eventually will lead to looser credit policies by both 
commercial banks and the federal reserve the us central bank 
for the time being though currency dealers apparently feel 
happier holding dollars then letting them go said hugh walsh a 
dealer in the new york office of amsterdam rotterdam bank 
people are more concerned right now with getting caught short 
dollars said walsh 
after the initial selling on chases announcement the dollar 
bounced off its lowest levels as buying resumed walsh said 
in tokyo the dollar fell 037 yen to 13928 yen later in london 
it was quoted at 13895 yen in new york the dollar finished at 
13920 yen unchanged from fridays late level 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
16410 to buy one pound more expensive than 16245 late friday 
later in new york it cost 16390 to buy one pound compared with 
16313 on friday 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with levels late 
friday included 18638 west german marks down from 18705 16015 
swiss francs down from 16095 63155 french francs down from

weather if these acreage reports are going to be negative said

when nike inc went public in 1980 business week 
magazine wondered whether the athletic shoe makers move to the 
stock market meant that the jogging craze had run its course 
now at the other end of the decade the company named for the 
greek goddess of victory is planning for future success around 
peoples continuing fascination with fitness 
people said nike has helped but also has taken a ride on the 
running boom said nike cofounder philip h knight what we 
used to call the running boom was really just the first shot of the 
fitness revolution 
knight nikes chairman and chief executive officer said in an 
interview that he believes this revolution has led to lifestyle 
changes that will keep the momentum rolling for sales of athletic 
shoes 
working out has become a habit for more people whether they 
like it or not because they know its good for them said knight 
you might get bored with sleeping but youve still got to do it 
knight was in new york on monday to for a news conference the 
first in the beaverton orebased companys history to release 
nikes latest financial results 
he also delivered his message to wall street securities analysts 
the analysts apparently werent completely satisfied with what they 
heard in nationwide overthecounter trading nike stock sank 1 to 
close at 4275 monday 
the company reported a 197 percent profit gain for the quarter 
ended may 31 income rose to 3646 million or 97 cents a share 
from 3047 million or 81 cents a share in the same quarter a year 
earlier sales totaled 41342 million a 166 percent increase over 
35442 million in the 1988 quarter 
in the 12 months ended may 31 nikes earnings rose 643 percent 
to 16705 million or 445 a share from 1017 million or 270 
a share sales for the year grew 425 percent to 171 billion from 
120 billion 
having had such a good year hasnt made nike complacent 
particularly because the 19841988 period was trying for the 
company sales which had been growing steadily sagged to 8765 
million in 1987 from 107 billion in 1986 
during those years rival shoe manufacturer reebok international 
ltd rode the crest of the aerobics wave to become a major force in 
the athletic footwear business and la gear carved out a slice of 
the market for itself becoming a brand sought after by girls and 
young women 
meanwhile nike made a few missteps it introduced entries in the 
casual segment of the sports shoe market under the nike brand name 
but they didnt go anywhere the verdict was that consumers couldnt 
accept leisure footwear from a company better known for 
highperformance athletic shoes 
it was a little like levis trying to sell suits knight 
recalled 
the company seems to have learned from that episode it no longer 
peddles shoes designed for casual wear using the nike name in 1988 
it boosted the base of its sportcasual division by debuting ie a 
line of athletically inspired shoes targeted at women in the 2535 
age group this year nike is bringing out side 1 a line of sporty 
and fashionable shoes for teenage girls 
in another move to branch out within the footwear field nike 
acquired colehaan a mainebased maker of highend dress and casual 
shoes in june 1988 
knight said the recent diversification into other footwear 
categories has been handled so the brands can develop on their own 
independent of nikes flagship shoe lines 
there is the chance of some overlap for instance knight said 
nikes footwear researchers are studying the possibility of 
incorporating advances in athletic footwear into street shoes 
to help build sales growth in the athletic shoe business nike 
has cultivated individual market segments and developed shoes 
ntended for specific pursuits 
its running shoes have been joined over the years by footwear for 
basketball walking hiking and windsurfing for example nike 
created a whole new category when it created its crosstraining 
shoe aimed at people who follow varied exercise regimens 
apparel has become an important part of nikes business and 
knight said the company is working with retailers to more closely 
coordinate the marketing of clothing and shoes 
we think we have a lot of room to grow in apparel knight 
said

the struggle for time inc enters a key phase 
tuesday as the media giant and its hostile pursuer paramount 
communications corp enter a delaware courtroom for what could be 
the pivotal confrontation of their fiveweekold takeover fight 
paramount trying to force times board to seriously consider its 
122 billion hostile bid will argue that time put itself up for 
sale when it agreed to a friendly stockswap merger with warner 
communications inc earlier this year and therefore must consider 
competing offers 
time will argue that its board never contemplated selling the 
company and that the agreement with warner which has since been 
changed to a 14 billion tender offer for warner stemmed from the 
ordinary conduct of times business 
tuesdays hearing before chancery court judge william t allen in 
wilmingon has been anxiously awaited by the companies and their 
employees and by time stockholders who could profit handsomely if 
paramounts 200 a share bid succeeds several major shareholders 
also will be in court tuesday seeking to stop the timewarner 
merger 
allens decision could affect more than just these three 
companies if time loses the climate for friendly mergers in this 
country could change radically many of the biggest us 
corporations are incorporated in delaware and subject to its laws 
observers have said it is difficult to predict how allen will 
rule but investors have grown pessimistic about paramounts chances 
of success and times stock price which hit a high of 18275 
after paramount announced its bid june 6 dropped back sharply as 
some traders decided to take their profits before the battle went to 
court 
time stock rose 112 to 15262 a share monday on the new york 
stock exchange warner stock rose 25 cents to 62 a share and 
paramount dipped 25 cents to 5675 a share 
the issue in tuesdays hearing according to duke university law 
school professor james d cox is whether entering into negotiations 
with warner triggers the auctioneer role for the time directors 
or can their conduct merely be judged by the business judgment 
rule 
the business judgment rule a widelyfollowed legal concept 
allows decisions made by directors in the normal course of business 
to stand courts generally are reluctant to disturb such decisions 
times lawyers might argue that the timewarner merger deal was 
the result of two years of onagain offagain negotiations time 
chairman j richard munro hinted the company was considering a 
merger when he told securities analysts last november that time 
intended to be among the growing ranks of global media conglomerates 
but paramount might contend as the company stated in the 
prospectus for its offer that its chairman martin s davis 
raised the possibility of a merger between paramount and time on 
several occasions during the past several years 
that raises the question of whether time entered into the merger 
agreement as a defensive step if that were the case time which 
has rejected the paramount bid as inadequate and highly conditional 
would be forced to consider buyout offers 
michael bradley a law professor at the university of michigan 
said the planned merger did not appear to meet the criteria under 
which a company must be considered up for sale 
if time were thinking of restructuring or some other drastic 
move like a leveraged buyout that would cross that threshhold 
bradley said its not clear that the negotiations put them into 
that posture 
bernard black a professor at the columbia university school of 
law said i would be very surprised if the delaware court stops 
time from buying warner partly because its a preexisting 
transaction 
but other observers say the issue revolves around the unequal 
stock positions between time and warner in their original merger 
proposal under that agreement the current warner shareholders 
would have 60 percent of the stock in time warner inc while the 
current time shareholders would have 40 percent 
melvin a eisenberg who teaches law at the university of 
california at berkeley said its ridiculous to say time is 
buying if warner is getting 60 percent of the equity 
under the original merger proposal time stockholders would have 
received a share in the new company for each share they owned while 
warner shareholders would have received 0465 of a share of the new 
timewarner for each of their warner shares 
there are other issues for allen to consider including whether 
times shareholders should be allowed to decide the future of the 
company 
allens ruling expected later this week will not settle the 
matter because the losing side is expected to appeal to the delaware 
supreme court

its hostile 122 billion offer for time inc if certain delays 
prevent it from closing the deal 
paramount said it had amended its offer of 200 per share in cash 
for all of times stock to give shareholders an additional interest 
payment of 9 percent annually if it is delayed beyond 60 days in 
getting needed regulatory approvals for transfer of cable licenses 
needed to complete the deal 
the interest would begin accruing 60 days after time either 
agrees or is ordered to refrain from interfering with paramounts 
efforts to obtain fcc and state and local cable regulatory 
approvals paramount said 
that would add about 150 a share to the bid each month 
donald oresman general counsel of paramount said our 
willingness to pay interest if the company cannot close its deal 
within 60 days underscores our confidence that regulatory 
approvals can be obtained within that period if times 
obstructionist tactics are stopped 
time offered no comment on the new terms of paramounts offer 
but previously rejected paramounts bid as inadequate and too 
conditional saying among other things that it would likely take a 
year or more for paramount to obtain the necessary approvals for 
cable license transfers 
but a source close to time said paramounts addition of interest 
to its reprsents a belated admission that it will take paramount a 
substantial period of time to obtain the necessary regulatory 
approvals 
paramount has contended it could win the necessary approvals 
within a few months if it were given the chance but has complained 
that time has been drumming up opposition among local cable 
regulators to paramounts efforts 
paramount stepped into the battle for time in june as time neared 
a shareholder vote on its proposed merger with warner communications 
inc in a deal that would create the worlds largest media and 
entertainment company 
time subsequently amended its merger plan and now is offering 14 
billion in cash and securities for warners stock in making that 
bid time said it would sweeten its offer at a rate of 9 percent a 
year if it were unable to complete the offer within 60 days 
paramounts decision to add interest to its tender offer for time 
was announced on the eve of a hearing set for tuesday in delaware 
chancery court over a suit that could determine who will win control 
of time 
paramount and some time shareholders want the court to block 
times acquisition of warner they are expected to argue that time 
put itself up for sale when it agreed to merger with warner and that 
time has not fairly considered paramounts bid 
in a separate filing monday with the federal communications 
commission paramount said it already has filed transfer 
applications representing the majority of subscribers to cable 
systems operated by times 82 percentowned american television and 
communications corp where such approvals are required

complaints of lost and mishandled baggage received by airlines in 
may shown as the number of reports per 1000 passengers on the 
airline 
department officials cautioned that these figures may not be 
comparable from airline to airline because of differing methods of 
reporting for example some airlines count in their complaint data 
courtesy tracers in which they seek to help people from other 
airlines find lost baggage in addition reporting methods vary for 
problems with carryon baggage and late arriving passengers

be prepared to explain why you are carrying 
a camera when visiting ethiopia dont travel in the soviet union 
unless youre in good health and be sure to have a visa upon 
arrival in india or youll find yourself on the next plane out 
regardless of its destination 
improper sexual relations with chinese citizens are verboten 
and if you are of criminal inclination never take illegal drugs 
into malaysia where traffickers face a mandatory death sentence 
so advises world status map a slick bimonthly publication that 
offers such travel advisories and disease warnings below its orange 
foldup map which colors war zones and other danger spots in red 
much of the information comes from the state department and the 
centers for disease control but publisher earl w may of fairfax 
says he uses more than 150 other sources including the world health 
organization the united nations world governments and news 
services 
may said in a telephone interview that the idea grew out of his 
brothers world travels may said he offered to find out about civil 
unrest and disease in various hot spots for his brother who worked 
for a company that drilled oil around the world 
he found there was a state department desk officer for each 
country theoretically i would have to make 200 calls and half 
the time they werent at the desk he said 
he decided there was a need for a publication to pull all of the 
available information together 
the first world status map published by mays wsm publishing co 
in merrifield came out in 1983 since then said may his 
subscription list has grown to more than 2000 travel agents 
individuals corporations and universities 
the most recent map warns that detention and heavy fines have 
been imposed on visitors engaging in improper sexual relations with 
chinese citizens 
may is not sure what those banned relations are 
despite the unrest in china it probably is a very safe country 
right now for travelers he said china is probably doing all 
they can to get those hundreds of thousands of tourists back that 
they lost he said 
binoculars cameras and video equipment should not be taken into 
ethiopia which is ruled by a military government fighting rebels in 
the northern provinces of eritrea and tigre 
in many of these countries you are at great risk if you take a 
picture of any building that they consider important to the 
government or the military he said 
if youre ill a sure way to feel even worse is to travel in the 
soviet union said may it has to do with the level of medication 
and hospital services available he said 
may also advised against taking alcoholic beverages even the 
tiny sample bottles offered by airlines into kuwait 
its just your basic dry country he said when you arrive 
if you dont declare with a customs agent that you have liquor you 
are subject to arrest if they find it on you other islamic 
countries have similar restrictions 
for anyone planning a trip to europe this summer its a 
greenlight with orange all the way across the continent on the 
latest issue of the map there is this for visitors coming the other 
way however a warning that the united states is jailing visitors 
who arrive with aids unless a waiver has been obtained in advance 
the world status map costs 36 for a years subscription

the federal express corp citing paperwork 
headaches is ending its shipments of defense department packages 
that require special handling a company spokesman said monday 
the decision follows a government study questioning federal 
express handling of such packages 
federal express has shipped the defense department packages 
through the companys constant surveillance courier service 
which requires more checkpoints than normal shipments 
those shipments bring in 4 million to 5 million a year while 
federal express has total annual revenues of 5 billion said dan 
copp a company spokesman 
the paperwork required which is very different from our 
paperwork and the inconsistent regulations make it very hard to 
deliver a 100 percent service level he said 
bruce edwards a spokesman for the military traffic management 
command said the defense department shipments handled by federal 
express will be assigned to other companies 
while the government was unsure it was getting what it paid for 
with the shipments edwards said no intentional wrongdoing was 
suspected 
of the 12 million packages federal express processes daily 700 
are constant surveillance shipments of those about 400 are for the 
defense department copp said 
none of them contained highly classified material or dangerous 
explosives he said 
the company will continue its constant surveillance service for 
other customers copp said 
with constant surveillance federal express employees follow a 
package more closely than usual and sign for it as it changes hands 
copp said 
following a government study that questioned whether the 
shipments were tracked sufficiently the defense department 
suspended federal express from handling its packages from may 12 
through june 28 
in its study the government questioned the handling of 182 of 
200000 defense department packages shipped through federal express 
over the past two years copp said 
federal express was able to trace 56 of the questioned shipments 
and found that company employees made errors in 27 of them he said 
sometimes the shipper that is the government or a government 
contractor will not have the paperwork right on the front end 
sometimes our people wont get all the signatures they should have 
gotten copp said

a coolingoff period called by the 
united mine workers was shattered almost as soon as it began monday 
by gunfire at a nonunion mine and an explosion that damaged a coal 
company trailer 
the owner of a security agency working at the nonunion mine in 
boomer said about 150 people some in masks and camouflage paint 
ambushed his employees around dawn overturning two trucks and a car 
and injuring several guards 
in matewan union supporters confronted a convoy of 15 to 18 
nonunion coal trucks shortly before gov gaston caperton was to 
promote an area tourism program said bennett hatfield whose rawl 
sales and processing co owns the trucks 
state police said four trucks were disabled with some flat tires 
and some damage 
one nonunion driver was slightly injured said a state police 
who refused to give her name 
caperton arrived after the incident and proceeded with his 
schedule 
gunfire also was reported at a mingo county mine 
umw president richard trumka called the threeday memorial 
period a work stoppage permitted under the unions national 
contract in what he said was an effort to restore calm to the 
appalachian and midwestern coal fields 
more than 30000 umw members have been engaged in a wildcat 
strike throughout appalachia and the midwest in support of 1900 
union members on strike since april against pittston in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky 
the wildcat strikers have ignored repeated backtowork orders 
from federal judges 
in virginia an explosion early monday damaged an office trailer 
owned by clinchfield coal co pittstons main subsidiary in 
virginia 
the explosion believed caused by a bomb occurred shortly after 
midnight along a road near nora said state police sgt mike frank 
in west virginia cliff nuckols head of a security agency at 
appalachian mining inc said scores of people converged on the mine 
entrance in boomer shots rang out and several guards who scuffled 
with the attackers suffered minor injuries he said 
they sneaked through the weeds you cant see them they come 
through the weeds and the woods and all of a sudden youre just 
looking at them theyre there nuckols said it was pitch 
black the whole thing happened within 3040 seconds 
state police are investigating said sgt jl miller he said 
the attackers stormed the landing escorted two guards down the 
hill and told them to hit the road 
in west virginias mingo county sid young a driver for 
nonunion hampden coal co said the mine was hit by gunfire early 
monday no injuries were reported 
the national coal contract allots 10 memorial days on which 
miners do not have to report to work such days usually are used to 
air labor grievances 
westmoreland coal co miners were not included in trumkas 
threeday holiday because its miners in virginia have used their 
allotment 
but company spokesman steve anderson said the miners remained off 
the job monday their first scheduled day back after their annual 
twoweek summer vacation 
everyone might have been too optimistic that we might see 
people return to work when the vacations over its not happening 
he said 
in philadelphia westmoreland announced that it has advised seven 
overseas customers whose shipments represented 308176 tons that 
it cant ship the coal because of production shortages resulting 
from the wildcat strike 
the company said if production doesnt resume by the end of this 
week it will be unable to fill additional export orders for 165865 
tons 
also monday a federal judge in big stone gap va sentenced 
three striking miners to jail terms ranging from three days to three 
months for driving in slowmoving convoys to block coal trucks 
us district judge glen williams who complained last week that 
huge fines were doing nothing to stop the convoys tried another 
approach finding the men guilty of contempt of court the wise 
county clerk said 
a fourth miner was found innocent 
in new york trumka joined sen jay rockefeller dwva and 
gary white head of the west virginia coal operators association in 
assuring japanese steel officials that the supply of appalachian 
coal is reliable despite the pittston strike

japan bought 13 million tons of us coal last year about half 
of it from west virginia and an increase of 3 million tons over 1987

an attorney representing about 300 depositors in a 
greek bank filed a lawsuit monday seeking 15 billion in damages 
and restitution for the depositors who claim their funds were 
removed from the country and frozen 
attorney constantine kangles said the classaction lawsuit filed 
in us district court would seek treble damages for us depositors 
in the national mortgage bank of greece 
kangles maintained that the bank used its us offices to prey on 
immigrant greeks by promising them high interest rates on deposits 
and that the earnings would be taxfree 
last month federal authorities raided us offices of the bank 
seized documents and arrested 14 of its officers on racketeering 
charges 
a bank spokesman monday denied the charges in the lawsuit 
not one bank account in greece has been frozen said the 
spokesman dimitris klitorakis speaking in athens 
the reports are incorrect not to say downright false 
klitorakis said he said the deposits have been transferred to the 
bank of greece the nations central bank and can be requested in 
the form of checks or remittances for any destination 
the only deposits that had been frozen were those made at the 
time of the us authorities raid he said 
he added that the number of people who had requested their money 
back was negligible 
barry slotnick a new york attorney representing the bank said 
all us representative offices of the bank were being staffed and 
that american depositors would have access to their funds next week 
the civil lawsuit against the bank and 14 of its officers came 
after federal authorities announced an investigation of the bank and 
the officers for racketeering on june 21 authorities raided seven 
branches in illinois massachusetts new york and pennsylvania 
seizing documents and arresting the officers 
the bank is charged with illegally accepting more than 700 
million in deposits from customers in the united states and sending 
the money overseas so the depositors could avoid us taxes 
according to a complaint filed in us district court in new york 
the national mortgage bank of greece is a separate entity from 
the stateowned national bank of greece which also operates in the 
united states the national bank of greece owns about 47 percent of 
the mortgage bank according to federal authorities 
in ads placed in greek language newspapers bank officers 
promised customers interest rates as high as 18 percent that would 
be paid in greek drachmas and would not be disclosed to us 
authorities kangles said 
he said about 300 people are behind the lawsuit but their ranks 
could swell to as many as 3000 the 15 billion represents treble 
damages based on an estimated 500 million in deposits involved he 
said 
the mortgage banks branches were not even legally authorized to 
accept money from customers in the united states authorities say 
rather the us branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of 
encouraging investment in greece 
mortgage bank says deposits in the united states were made at 
bankers trust and atlantic bank branches not at mortgage bank 
both those banks as well as mortgage bank are controlled by the 
national bank of greece
