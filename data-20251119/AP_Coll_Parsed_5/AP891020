news organizations that used unidentified sources 
to erroneously link a sailor to the explosion that killed 47 
crewmen on the uss iowa will be challenged in court to identify 
those sources the sailors attorney said friday 
we are going to name several media outlets as defendants for 
the untrue and defamatory accusations that came out immediately 
after the explosion attorney ellis rubin told the society of 
professional journalists annual convention 
rubin represents kendall truitt who the attorney said was 
identified in stories following the april gun turret explosion 
aboard the battleship as a homosexual friend of one of the sailors 
clayton hartwig 
hartwig died in the blast last month a navy report citing 
circumstantial evidence said hartwig was the most likely person to 
have caused the explosion 
stories on the hartwigtruitt link cited unidentified sources 
we know who the sources are rubin said the sources will 
deny itll be an interesting exercise 
he said the news organizations which he would not identify 
would refuse to name the sources or invoke first amendment 
protections 
rubin said defendants who dont reveal a source will have to pay 
damages because under the law that means there is no source and 
they just made it up 
theyre going to have a tough choice he said 
truitt who also appeared on the panel to discuss whether the 
press went too far in covering the investigation of the iowa 
explosion said hartwig was a friend but denied any homosexual 
relationship 
i understand the public has a right to know and the press a 
right to print he said but whatever happened to innocent 
until proven guilty incredible its as if the press has immunity 
through leaks in the press my life has been ruined forever 
truitt said as recently as the past week he has been written 
about in newspapers as being dead 
we all want to be fair rubin said but there is supposed 
to be a balance 
jean otto a board member of the american society of newspaper 
editors and chairman of the groups barpress public affairs 
committee said a key question in developing such stories is 
whether reporters can trust the government 
i think that question can be answered very clearly she 
said i think the government has a natural interest in lying 
rubin contends navy negligence outmoded technology unstable 
gunpowder and an untrained crew were responsible for the explosion 
from the point of view of the government employee who was 
leaking the information i believe the sources that leaked to the 
media did it intentionally to take the focus away from the fact 
that the battleship is an armored dinosaur and is no longer an 
effective weapon of war he said 
paul mcmasters deputy editorial page editor for usa today and 
national freedom of information chairman for the society of 
professional journalists defended pursuit of stories by using 
unidentified sources 
some things will never come to fruition if there isnt public 
pressure to know the whole story he said adding that reporters 
need to know the motive for government leaks 
you have a responsiblity as a journalist to let the audience 
know what side of the street your leak is on he said

as northern californians added up 
earthquake repair bills in the billions of dollars southern 
californians lined up to plop down 21 apiece to be shaken and 
scared by a fake shake 
the attraction the universal studios tours simulated 
earthquake which officials had closed for two days after tuesdays 
deadly temblor devastated the san francisco bay area 
when the attraction reopened friday morning thousands braved a 
light chilly rain to clamber aboard trams and see what they might 
have missed 
or in the case of northern californian ruth hitchcock to be 
shaken again 
it bounced me all over my driveway she said of tuesdays 
quake that rattled her livermore home ive lived in that house 
for 32 years and its the strongest one ive ever felt 
but it wasnt enough to keep her from canceling a trip to 
southern california and a longplanned visit to the universal 
studios tour and its simulated earthquake ride 
i came clear down here to see this ms hitchcock said 
excitedly afterward if they had canceled it i would have been 
very disappointed 
none of those interviewed friday seemed bothered that the fake 
quake is supposed to happen in san francisco or that they had just 
witnessed a giant tanker truck hurled through the air as a roadway 
fell in a staged scene similar to tuesdays deadly collapse of 
oaklands nimitz freeway 
francis mcclaskey who went through los angeles sylmar quake in 
1971 dismissed the irony with a wave of his hand 
nah its all in fun said the retired trucker who now lives 
in boulder colo this place is all makebelieve people can 
separate reality from fantasy 
i thought it was great especially when the freeway bridge 
came down said jim tolent one of a group of teenagers who 
bounded from the tour tram talking excitedly about the ride but 
i do feel sorry for the people of san francisco 
curtis marshall of tracy said he was kind of sad he hadnt 
been home in northern california for the real thing he was at 
disneyland on tuesday 
surin hutawaniatana of bangkok thailand said he would have 
missed the attraction if the real quake hadnt hit 
we were going to san francisco he said of his tour group 
but when they canceled that part of the trip we got to come here 
instead 
he added he was thrilled with the ride 
i had heard its great and it was he said 
even so tour operators were taking no chances at offending 
anyone 
while visitors were threatened by a robotic giant shark from the 
movie jaws shot at by actors dressed as space aliens and 
buried in a makebelieve avalanche the comic patter of tour guides 
ran apace 
but it halted as the tram was about to enter a sound stage made 
to look like a bay area rapid transit subway tunnel 
for those of you who do not want to experience this we 
perfectly understand a tour guide said solemnly over a 
microphone as he gave any of the more than 200 tram riders an 
opportunity to get off one woman did 
that is not a regular thing universal spokeswoman joan 
bullard said of halting the tram before the fake quake we are 
doing it today and perhaps this weekend 
when the tram finally entered the set several people braced 
themselves 
its only makebelieve one woman cautioned her son 
several riders applauded when the quake was over but some 
veterans of real quakes expressed mild disappoint they noted the 
ride didnt last long enough or shake violently enough to match the 
real thing 
i liked the avalanche better because it really gave you the 
feeling you were falling tolent said

the late engineer which gave 750000 to the red cross and 
250000 to the salvation army 
this isnt something we do every day said executive

allday pledgeathon and a tucson ariz hairstylist announced

too 
but relief officials worried that the aid was insufficient to 
fill all of the immediate needs of what could be the most expensive

at as high as 10 billion 
we need cash first and foremost because of who we are we 
can stretch your dollars said chris garrett spokeswoman for the 
red cross chapter in san francisco

that only money can buy such as new glasses prescription 
medicines and false teeth 
by friday morning 5000 people were housed in 30 shelters in 
the bay area an estimated 12550 people were displaced in all 
according to the state office of emergency services

responses came from californians especially quakenervous southern 
californians 
fullertonbased homeclub inc a chain of home improvement 
stores donated about 200 shovels 600 trash cans and 2500 canvas 
gloves to the salvation army 
the parent company of catalina cruises sent four of its 
700passenger ships from long beach to the bay area to ferry people 
and supplies between oakland and san francisco

vice president jan delyber the wholesalers all rallied around 
the cause and in one hour we had the shipment

the pentagon nixed two joint performances by the 
soviet red army band and navy bands but promoters say they dont 
see the concerts causing a security breach and are fighting to 
reverse the decision 
the 200member red army song and dance ensemble including the 
40piece band is scheduled to perform oct 24 in the seattle 
center arena during its first tour of the united states 
easterday promotions suggested that the 35piece sand point navy 
band appear in a free seattle performance with the red army band 
the same day said owner kris easterday 
she also worked to arrange a joint appearance of the soviet band 
with the 35piece fairchild air national guard band in spokane on 
oct 26 
both sand point and fairchild authorities were enthusiastic 
easterday said but cmdr james britt at sand point said officials 
had to submit the proposal to the pentagon 
on wednesday about two weeks after easterday started promoting 
the events the navy rejected the joint appearances 
britt said he didnt know why the navy rejected the idea 
easterday said a pentagon official capt doug mcurrach told her 
the two countries had restrictions on the movement of military 
personnel in each others countries 
the promoters were baffled 
its just an innocent half hour for the bands to get 
together said easterday spokeswoman kerry coughlin it seeme 
really strange 
easternday asked the office of sen slade gorton for help and 
the republican lawmakers seattle office started contacting navy 
officials on friday 
slade is convinced that this is a good event to have and were 
seeking to have the decision reviewed at the least and at best 
reversed said gorton aide chuck nordhoff were hoping that 
message has gotten through but we dont know 
mcurrach could not be reached for comment friday evening

nine concerts after the quake 
theatrical productions were disrupted but most shows were to 
resume early next week 
mayor art agnos encouraged san francisco bay area art

sen john glenn lost his chance to be 
michael dukakis presidential running mate last year because he 
gave unconvincing answers about his connection to a campaign 
contributor in the savings and loan industry says a new book 
the book all by myself the unmaking of a presidential 
campaign says dukakis was leaning toward the ohio democrat as 
his vice presidential candidate until aides warned the 
massachusetts governor that glenns finances could be a political 
liability 
thomas oliphant a boston globe reporter who wrote the book with 
colleague christine m black said this week that the contributor 
who wasnt named in the book was charles h keating jr president 
of lincoln savings and loan association in irvine calif 
no one suggested that senator glenn had done anything illegal 
or even ethically questionable but the hard time he had answering 
questions forcefully was potentially troublesome the dayton 
daily news quoted the book as saying in a story in saturdays 
editions 
the newspaper said it obtained a copy of the book which has not 
been released 
federal investigators last month accused keating of stealing 
more than 11 billion from his savings and loan through illegal 
loans and phony realestate and tax transactions 
glenn and four other senators have come under criticism for 
intervening with federal regulators two years ago during an 
investigation of keating keating has made donations to glenn 
totaling 234000 
oliphant said it had to do with a judgment as to which person 
would stand up better in front of a battery of 500 microphones if 
it ever came to that 
glenn refused through an aide to comment on the book and a book 
on the savings and loan scandal the big fix that recounts 
glenns involvement on keatings behalf 
the senator hasnt read these books glenn press secretary 
rebecca bell said we just are not going to comment on excerpts 
from a book 
dukakis chose sen lloyd bentsen dtexas as his running mate 
after campaign aides argued glenn was a less reliable candidate 
because of questions about his finances the book says 
at the time news organizations were reporting glenn as the 
frontrunner for the no 2 spot citing sources in the dukakis 
campaign 
glenn has acknowledged a long relationship with keating but 
denied any wrongdoing the senator said he met twice with federal 
regulators in april 1987 at keatings request after keating 
complained the investigation of his business was taking too long 
but backed off after learning the probe could lead to criminal 
charges 
chairman paul brountas the dukakis campaign chairman who 
conducted the final interviews with both glenn and bentsen 
disputed the books assertion that glenns demeanor under 
questioning threw the nomination to bentsen 
i disagree with the author and if he got it from a top aide i 
disagree with the top aide brountas said 
but brountas acknowledged the dukakis campaign throughly 
reviewed what he called the strengths and weaknesses of the 
candidates what they would add to the campaign what kind of vice 
presidents they would be

parachutists plans to jump off the 
new river gorge bridge are up in the air while the national park 
service considers whether to ban this years bridge day leaps 
ranger rick brown said thursday the new river would have to drop 
6 feet for the jumps to go off as scheduled on saturday in the 10th 
annual event 
tim velie a board member of the fayette county chamber of 
commerce said he still hopes the river will subside in time for 
the jumps off the bridge 876 feet above the river 
but he said even if the jumping is canceled bridge day events 
such as an arts and crafts exhibit would be held 
bridge day attracts divers worldwide and is the largest event of 
the year for parachutists belonging to the us base association 
state police will reroute the northbound lanes of us 19 during 
the event and allow pedestrians to walk on the highway 
bridge day is the only time parachutists can legally jump from 
the bridge its relatively safe said jean boenish executive 
director of base which stands for people who jump off buildings 
antennas spans and earth forms 
our volunteer staff is experienced base jumpers and they help 
divers chose the right gear and show them the right techniques 
said boenish who also coordinates the new river jumps 
three people have been killed in parachute leaps from the 
bridge two during the bridge day festivities the last death was 
in 1987 
some state officials talked of banning the event following the 
accidents but event organizers say bridge day provides the divers 
with a safe outlet 
the event began in 1980 with a handful of jumpers last year 
more than 100000 people turned out to watch 300 divers perform 600 
jumps from the center of the bridge

early estimates that more than 250 people 
were killed under the collapsed nimitz highway were proving to be 
high but no new estimates were offered authorities said 
rescue workers found cars separated by as much as 60 feet 
rather than bumpertobumper as feared 
authorities had said more than 270 people were killed by 
tuesdays earthquake 250 of them during the nimitz cavein that 
was based on an estimate of how many vehicles would have been 
crushed when the upper level of the freeway collapsed onto the 
lower level and an estimate of one person per car 
now they are going lower much lower in fact lisa 
covington a spokeswoman for the state office of emergency 
services said thursday whats happening is that they are 
finding fewer vehicles under the bridge than they thought 
reaching the vehicles has been painstakingly slow because of a 
fear that huge sections of the interstate could collapse further on 
rescue workers 
were not going to give any estimate said sgt donna jay of 
the alameda county coronors officei dont know how many people 
are there were not going to know until they dig them out 
coroners and other officials in the seven counties affected by 
the quake said 35 bodies have been recovered

the state supreme court has decided 
long briefs are on the way out for florida attorneys and court 
clerks 
but the high court wasnt making a fashion statement thursday 
beginning in january 1991 the states court system will no 
longer use legalsized paper 8 by 14 inches in any documents 
including lawsuits pleadings notices opinions judgments and 
motions the change mirrors rules in the federal courts and at 
least 36 other states 
the new rule actually takes effect in january 1990 but the 
supreme court decided to allow a oneyear grace period during which 
the states courts can accept either the legal size or standard 
8by11 paper 
for years a group called eliminate legalsize files or elf 
has campaigned to get government to use the standard size 
walt mullarkey a retired certified records manager for the 
state division of library services was chairman of elf for five 
years 
its just standardization if everybody in the army fired a 
different size weapon theyd have a hell of a time fighting a 
war mullarkey said 
he said advantages to using just one size include having uniform 
filing cabinets and savings from buying a single size in bulk 
rather than two sizes 
when the state supreme court first proposed the rule in april 
there was some understandable criticism said sid white clerk of 
the supreme court 
it seems like most of the opposition came from people who were 
selling legalsize paper and cabinets white said

us military personnel in south korea buy six 
times as much chivas regal scotch as the much larger us force in 
europe but instead of drinking it theyre selling it on the 
korean black market a study says 
spam aqua net hair spray and rice are among other favorites 
selling in huge quantities at us military commissaries in south 
korea apparently bound for the black market the general 
accounting office said thursday 
such sales far exceed what would normally be consumed by the 
70000 authorized buyers stationed there and us taxpayers are 
footing part of the bill gao witnesses said at a senate hearing 
the gao is congress investigative arm 
the defense department exports dutyfree goods to bases in korea 
and other countries for sale at cutrate prices in the commissaries 
and exchanges 
in 1988 commissaries in south korea sold 11 million cans of 
spam or almost 12 pounds per person per year 34 pounds or 816 
american cheese slices for every man woman and child and 170 
pounds of rice for every consumer 
if one person consumed 170 pounds of rice a year that would 
be a little over 14 pounds of rice a month or just under a half a 
pound of rice a day said sen carl levin dmich chairman of 
the senate governmental affairs subcommittee on government 
oversight and management 
there would be little room in a persons diet for anything 
else but rice he said 
black marketeers recruit us service members or their 
dependents to buy the products for later resale or enlist the help 
of cashiers and sales clerks mostly koreans 
the investigators concluded that most of the chivas regal scotch 
purchased for sale including the 12yearold bottle and 
21yearold bottle ends up in the black market in 1988 service 
members in korea bought 314748 liters of the scotch 
fewer military members in korea 15 percent of the total in 
europe purchased more than six times the number of chivas regal 
bottles purchased in europe the investigators said 
in addition the meat merchant who services the osan air base 
told investigators that 70000 pounds of oxtails are supplied per 
month to the commissary 
donna heivilin director of logistics issues for the gao said 
korean tariffs make the price of legally imported us goods very 
expensive 
heivilin told the subcommittee the cost of serving the black 
market was about 7 million a year assuming that 20 percent of the 
2504 million worth of items sold in korea in 1988 ended up in the 
cupboards of unauthorized individuals 
this is totally abhorrent totally unacceptable said levin 
who has called for a reduction of us forces in korea 
sandra kristoff an assistant us trade representative for asia 
and the pacific acknowledged that koreas restrictive import 
practices have fueled the black market 
but she stressed that the korean black market has been in 
existence for some time and the united states is taking steps to 
reduce the illegal sales 
in july of 1988 our cigarette agreement with korea went into 
effect permitting the importation of cigarettes without 
restraint she said black market activity in this product has 
dropped off significantly since then 
to solve the problem levin has suggested elimination of the 
ration control system in which service members with no dependents 
are limited to 500 per month and those with dependents 800 per 
month 
another option is convincing south korea to open its doors to 
these highdemand consumer goods he said

a federal appeals court overturned the 
12year prison sentence of a colombian drug trafficker on grounds 
that a lowercourt judge wrongly considered the mans nationality 
in determining punishment 
the threemember appeals panel on thursday returned the case of 
mauricio borreroisaza to us district judge william d keller for 
resentencing 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that a sentence may 
not be based even partly on a defendants nationality noting that 
keller penalized borrero more harshly than a noncolombian 
codefendant 
borrero was convicted of conspiracy and possession with intent 
to distribute cocaine after he was arrested in 1986 with more than 
two pounds of the drug in his car 
during sentencing keller repeatedly told the defense attorney 
that he wanted to show people in cocaineexporting countries that 
they would be harshly punished if they shipped drugs to the united 
states 
somehow the people who are selling narcotics particularly 
from source countries have to know that we in the united states 
mean business and we are going to put a stop to this keller 
said at the time i want people in colombia to know it is not 
going to be tolerated 
the appeals court said that while it is appropriate to consider 
the fact that a criminal has trafficked in drugs originating from 
a source country like colombia a defendants nationality is 
irrelevant 
thomas lind a codefendant who pleaded guilty in the case 
received a sevenyear sentence from keller

senate concern about freedom of speech and a 
cooling of the summers political passions combined to defeat the 
proposed constitutional amendment to ban flag burning lawmakers 
say 
i dont know that public interest has faded i think that 
public interest has changed sen john c danforth rmo said 
thursday after the proposed amendment failed in the senate 
opponents of the measure said americans are having second 
thoughts about the notion of changing the constitution 
white house lobbying appeared minimal despite a strong public 
campaign that last summer took president bush to the foot of the 
iwo jima memorial 
the measure did win a bare majority in the senate 5148 but 
fell 15 votes short of the required twothirds of senators present 
and voting 
eleven republicans joined 37 democrats to oppose the measure 
thirtythree republicans and 18 democrats voted for the proposal 
which would have authorized the state and federal governments to 
outlaw flag desecration 
following the vote white house spokeswoman alixe glen said bush 
was disappointed and believes such an amendment represents 
the only real protection for the flag she said a bill sent 
to the president last week to ban flagburning by statute would 
not survive constitutional scrutiny 
critics of the amendment in contrast said the bill would 
satisfy concern in the country about flagburning 
i think when the statute passed it made it much easier to 
focus on the constitution said sen patrick j leahy dvt 
but this amendment should fall anyway because of the danger it 
poses to the bill of rights 
sen strom thurmond rsc a strong supporter of the 
amendment told reporters that the public was confused on this 
they were led to believe a statute would do the job and 
produce results he said now we dont know what weve got if 
anything 
supporters of the amendment claimed it was the only sure way to 
prevent a recurrence of the supreme court decision in june that 
overturned the conviction of texas flagburner gregory lee johnson 
on grounds his right to free speech was violated 
we all lose with this action said miles eplin national 
commander of the american legion after the vote today i feel 
like my friends have been let down as well as those from other 
generations who died believing that our nation would always 
remember their sacrifices and respect the foremost symbol of all 
they held dear 
critics said there would be a political price to pay at election 
time for opposing the measure at the same time though they 
seemed increasingly emboldened to attack the amendment as a threat 
to the constitution 
we face no sudden or uncontrollable burst of flag 
destruction majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
declared yet we are being asked to believe that the flag 
which neither hitler nor stalin could defeat is now threatened by a 
single misguided person who most americans never heard of and dont 
care about 
minority leader bob dole rkan took the senate floor on 
thursday morning to make one last appeal for approval of the 
measure he painted a colorful panorama of flag history from iwo 
jima to the lunar landing and said the senate was too bogged down 
in technicalities 
the need for this amendment will not be found in a textbook or 
a treatise on constitutional law dole said no it will be 
found in the emotions of the heart emotions deeply rooted in the 
reallife experiences of millions of americans and emotions that 
are crying out today to give the flag real and lasting protection 
afterward dole said i think the flag should be flown at 
halfstaff after this vote 
danforth and sen warren rudman rnh initially cosponsored 
the proposal but both did an aboutface on tuesday and became 
opponents 
when i was originally asked to support it i thought i want 
to protect the flag danforth said but as the vote got 
closer and as i started reflecting on it and getting more serious 
about it my opinion became one of the greatest reluctance to 
change the constitution

earthquakedamaged homes collapsed 
under the prodding of powerful aftershocks thursday renewing fears 
among hundreds of residents already too horrified to go indoors 
the whole neighborhood went outside its too scary inside 
when these things hit resident lucy hernandez said hours after 
the series of aftershocks struck this quiet agricultural community 
70 miles south of san francisco 
more than 150 homes in the narrow coastal valley will likely be 
condemned many of those dealt the ultimate blow during the 
aftershocks to tuesdays destructive 69magnitude temblor said 
city clerk lorraine washington 
preliminary estimates place damage at nearly 100 million some 
24 million to homes and up to 75 million to industrial and 
commercial buildings 
watsonville is about 20 miles south of the epicenter of the 
quake 
some stores on main street probably have to be demolished 
washington said the older brick and unreinforced concrete 
structures took the brunt of the latest shaking 
the quakes were too much for the historical st patricks 
catholic church which withstood the 1906 quake with its 
underpinnings crumbling demolition is considered a certainty 
the violent rumbles sent chills through the 30000 residents in 
the predominantly hispanic community part of californias 
socalled salad bowl region where much of the nations 
lettuce asparagus and artichokes are grown 
twenty miles northwest of watsonville in the seaside city of 
santa cruz authorities said as many as 10000 people were believed 
to be homeless thursday night 
also thursday santa cruz county officials closed all beaches in 
the city because of a sewage spill and a strong aftershock that 
struck in the late afternoon caused more damage to a major highway 
already closed after tuesdays temblor 
earlier in the day a rescue team pulled the body of 23yearold 
robin ortiz from under two tons of rubble that rained down on her 
when a downtown santa cruz coffee store collapsed during tuesdays 
deadly earthquake 
the discovery brought a tragic end to an emotional conflict 
between searchers and the womans friends who had insisted that 
ms ortiz might be alive and criticized rescue efforts as too slow 
police said at least five people were arrested wednesday night 
when they broke through a barricade at the site of the santa cruz 
coffee roasting co after being told that the search was being 
halted at dark 
in watsonville washington said 400 to 500 residents sought 
refuge in shelters and another 500 were camping outside on lawns 
in back yards parks and empty fields 
these people dont want to go back home and dont want to go 
to the shelters they feel safer outdoors than in a building 
washington said 
marcelina toussaint a 73yearold woman wearing purple gloves 
and a felt beret said she slept uneasily in a chair next to her 
front door and made frequent dashes outside whenever the earth 
moved 
i cant stop shaking mrs toussaint said i guess im 
surviving but im scared 
many residents who emptied out of their broken homes spread 
across lawns and vacant lots like refugees 
were talking about people with no resources no money for 
food and no money for health care said barbara garcia executive 
director of salud pera la gente a statefunded community clinic 
i think the big thing now is that the aftershocks are really 
scaring people ms garcia said 
hundreds of people spent the night at local red cross shelters 
and churches and more than 100 camped in a vacant downtown lot 
designated as the future site of the watsonville post office 
we have no place to live the building cracked said raoul 
perez 36 who works in the lettuce fields 
thirty children romped on a pile of clothing nearby as perez 
added its hard especially for the kids because we have no 
gas water special things for kids 
at a shelter set up at a national guard armory near the airport 
scores of families sat on steel folding chairs and cots with 
blankets and clothing strewn everywhere 
earthquake victims also found food and shelter at st patricks 
even though the red brick church was shattered by the quake the 
rev mike miller voiced optimism during his thursday sermon 
he reminded his congregation gathered in another church 
building the foundation of the church is christ and thats an 
unshakeable rock weve just lost a house the church well 
have to build a new house 
miller who also conducted prayer services at local shelters 
said he found quake victims at peace and glad to have each 
other 
i guess what ill remember most about the shelters were the 
people clinging to each other they were clinging to the right 
things he said

today sensitive instruments detect every tiny 
movement of the earths crust recording in detail disastrous 
earthquakes like the one in northern california on tuesday 
these geological tools represent the ultimate refinement in a 
line that began almost 2000 years ago with the ancient dragon bowl 
that dropped a ball when shaken 
the first earthquake recording device was credited to the 
chinese philosopher chang heng in the year 132 
he developed a bowl with dragonshaped heads located at eight 
points around the outside each had a small ball balanced in its 
mouth during an earthquake the ball dropped out landing in the 
mouth of a toad statue located below 
the location of a quake was supposed to determine which dragon 
dropped its ball and the instrument was said to have recorded a 
quake 400 miles away that could not be felt by people near the bowl 
j de la haute feuille developed a similar device to record 
quakes in the year 1703 filling his bowl to the brim with mercury 
in a quake some mercury would spill on the side toward the quake 
dave russ assistant chief geologist at the us geological 
survey said that in modern measuring devices instruments near the 
center of an earthquake are knocked off their recording scale in a 
violent temblor but readings can be calculated from the waves 
reaching more distant machines 
agency scientists at menlo park calif near the site of 
tuesdays deadly quake are now collecting all available 
information on what happened 
the basic tool today is a seismograph an instrument developed 
in the late 19th century 
basically it is a box with a frame attached to the ground that 
includes a suspended weight which is able to swing when an 
earthquake causes the frame to move inertia forces the mass to lag 
behind and its swing is recorded by a pen and ink sweeping back and 
forth over paper that pen trace is the commonly shown seismogram 
these machines can be set for vertical or horizontal shaking and 
in modern machines the shaking produces an electrical signal which 
is amplified to drive a pen allowing them to be much more 
sensitive than in the past 
over the years scientists have learned that earthquakes produce 
more than one type of wave and that the different kinds move 
through the earths crust at different speeds 
by comparing the time of arrival of the different wave forms at 
a seismograph scientists can determine how far away a quake 
occurred comparing the results at several locations allows them to 
calculate the exact position of the quake 
while these are still the primary instruments used to measure 
quakes geologists also have developed an array of other machines 
for example russ pointed out that in parts of california along 
the san andreas fault laser beams are used to measure land 
movement 
the laser is placed on a hill and shines on a target located on 
the other side of a fault regular flashes of light allow the 
scientist to compare the time it takes for the light to travel 
between the two spots and thus calculate whether the light and 
target are moving relative to one another 
other instruments buried in the earth can sense the stresses 
placed on rocks measurements are also made of radon and other 
gases released by the earth and sensitive meters can even trace 
changes in the strength of gravity beneath the spots where they are 
located 
a pendulum was first used to record a quake in naples in 1731 
with nichomas cirillo reporting that the amplitude of the swing 
decreased with distance from the quakes 
using a magnifier trained at the image of a cross hair focused 
on a bowl of mercury robert mallet was able to measure the speed 
of waves in the earth following dynamite explosions in england in 
1851 
luigi palmieri installed a seismograph at mount vesuvius in 
1856 but the instruments were brought into general use toward the 
end of that century by a group of british geologists headed by john 
milne working in japan 
milne eventually managed to get seismograph stations set up 
around the world collecting data at a central observatory for 
analysis

the stage is set for a presidential veto of a 
bill allowing governmentpaid abortions for poor women who are 
victims of rape or incest 
the senate put the matter in president bushs hands thursday 
when it gave final congressional approval to a spending bill 
including the new provisions for medicaid abortions 
the 6731 vote drew little debate after the houses surprise 
vote last week to approve the broader provisions the senate passed 
the measure before but final agreement on a compromise spending 
bill was needed to send the bill to the president 
the measure would allow federal money to be spent on abortions 
for poor women who are victims of rape or incest and who reported 
promptly to law enforcement or public health authorities 
medicaid restrictions in the law since 1981 permit federal money 
for abortions only in cases where the life of the mother is 
endangered by her pregnancy 
the president has told us he will veto this bill because he 
wont accept language that allows poor rape and incest victims 
access to abortions said sen brock adams dwash 
im sorry the president of the united states the most 
powerful man in the world has chosen to veto this bill and 
thereby cause enormous additional suffering for some of the worlds 
most unfortunate and powerless victims he said 
rep bill green of new york a republican moderate said 30 
house republicans have sent bush a letter urging him to sign the 
bill green said bushs opposition to the measure puts him and us 
in a really indefensible position 
i would strongly urge the president to recognize that poor 
women have the right to make that same moral choice as rich 
women do green said 
the abortion provision is part of a 1567 billion measure to 
finance labor health and education programs for fiscal 1990 which 
began oct 1 
bush had said last week he was looking for room for 
flexibility and did not wish conflict on abortion an issue 
that has been troublesome for him throughout his political career 
but this week he hardened his stand and promised the veto saying 
government financing of the abortions would compound a violent 
act with the taking of an unborn life 
bush says he supports permitting abortions in cases of rape 
incest or danger to the life of the mother but opposes having the 
federal government pay for the abortions in cases of rape or incest

the bush administration doesnt share the 
enthusiasm of us businesses eager to jump in for profit and 
excitement as soviet leader mikhail gorbachev seeks to reform a 
marxist system lagging in productivity and consumer goods 
secretary of state james a baker iii speaking this week to the 
private foreign policy association in new york again stressed the 
view that lasting economic change must come from within it cannot 
and should not be provided by the west 
consumer shortages are unlikely to be relieved nor productivity 
increased without a stable currency free and competitive markets 
private property and real prices baker said the very logic of 
perestroika requires that the soviets themselves must solve their 
own problems in a comprehensive organic way he said 
but american businesses are charging in nonetheless fifty new 
posts are being added to the us embassy in moscow to assist them 
in grappling with soviet bureaucracy and a legal system that is in 
such flux that entrepreneurs are having a rough time seizing 
capitalistic opportunities 
gorbachev may be changing the way soviet bureaucrats and 
ordinary citizens think about the marketplace but historically 
people who have lived all their lives under marxism are not 
risktakers 
the soviets also do not have the cash to pay for americanbuilt 
enterprises nor the goods to barter for them with the exception 
of such items as oil gold diamonds and furs that the soviets 
prefer to sell for themselves on world markets 
and yet about 4000 american companies are trying to do business 
in the soviet union compared to less than 100 before gorbachev 
assumed power in 1985 a thousand joint ventures have been signed 
and registered but only a dozen or so deals have been struck the 
most picturesque mcdonalds and pizza hut soon will be selling 
fast food to russians 
the foreign investment is relatively small averaging about 1 
million a venture 
still american businessmen look at the soviet union as the last 
great untapped market said richard n dean the coudert brothers 
lawyer who last year opened the first moscow office for an american 
law firm dean said thursday that under gorbachev the soviets have 
bent over backwards to liberalize their joint venture laws 
but he described other laws that govern american investors as 
very uncertain territory often he said soviet laws are not 
available to the public either they are state secrets or nobody 
can find them dean said at a forum on ussoviet trade 
relations 
getting approval for projects also is a huge problem for 
westerners this is a business culture that is sort of fused with 
a political culture dean said 
moreover the general atmosphere in the soviet union is hazy 
soviet law is in the midst of a major overhaul the right to 
strike ownership of property freedom of assembly and speech are 
among the fundamental issues being debated in the supreme soviet 
this carries a risk for american businesses which prefer stability 
and certainty 
and yet there is a trend under gorbachev to promote domestic 
benefits for the soviet people the city council in moscow is 
prepared to give up a hotel site if the foreign partner is willing 
to arrange financing to rebuild a factory outside the capital dean 
said 
this is a good thing and it offers some opportunities said 
the american lawyer it gets at an awful problem that they have 
the deterioration in the standard of living of the soviet people is 
becoming a greater and greater concern

opponents of cuts in education funds said a huge 
statehouse demonstration showed the strength of their cause and 
students volunteered to replace mums that were trampled when the 
rally turned unruly 
about 15000 state college and university students gathered at 
the capitol wednesday but organizers lost control of the protest 
four people were arrested and two injured in the melee 
the fact that so many people came out was extraordinary and 
sent a very clear message that they care about the quality of their 
education paul tsongas chairman of the board of regents in 
higher education said thursday but like i remember during my 
youth the excesses of a handful always get more attention than 
what i believe was the remarkably good behavior of the vast vast 
majority 
horticulture students from the university of massachusetts at 
amherst volunteered thursday to plant chrysanthemums to replace the 
ones trampled by students in front of the capitol said state rep 
stanley rosenberg 
doors and windows inside the building were broken and a 
drainpipe was knocked down by students who climbed to the roof the 
maintenance office said the front lawn would need to be reseeded 
rep jacqueline lewis was caught in the crunch of students and 
shaken up as she tried to enter the chamber to answer a rollcall 
vote but she said she wouldnt hold the illbehaved and 
outrageous minority against the students cause 
the higher education budget already strapped by earlier cuts 
is set to be stripped of 25 million more during the next round of 
budget reductions the protesters were calling for the programmed 
cuts to be restored

many priests are called upon at the hour of 
death but the rev bob nelson may be the only priest with his 
finger on the button of the bombs that could one day obliterate 
mankind 
as a nuclear test controller at the nevada test site his job is 
to safely detonate the most powerful and horrifying weapons as an 
ordained episcopal priest he prays those weapons will never be 
used 
actually nelson says it isnt buttons that set off the bombs 
its all done by computers now he explained in a recent 
interview 
but with priests generally among the protesters at the 
underground test site where he works nelson says he is forced 
daily to reconcile the differences between his occupation and his 
calling 
he admits to being the only priest i know who fires nuclear 
weapons nelson a 48yearold father of two children became a 
priest two years ago and as he explains it almost against his 
will 
with my family work and other commitments i thought becoming 
a priest was something that just couldnt happen nelson said 
but he finally heeded a bishops advice that a true calling 
would not go away 
the way god works he just doesnt follow the rules at all 
he said 
as deputy manager of nevada operations for the energy department 
and one of three rotating controllers at the test site he has 
given the final authority for the detonation of more than 30 
underground nuclear tests in the 1980s 
nelson often is asked to go before antinuclear groups and 
explain the governments position that nuclear testing is vital to 
the nations security 
i dont think in any of these discussions i change anybodys 
mind or they change mine but we come away from honest and direct 
discussions the better for it he said the best comment i ever 
got from one antinuclear activist was i dont agree with what 
youre doing but im glad youre the one doing it 
he added that he would like to be in a situation where there are 
no nuclear weapons but i would also like a situation where we 
maintain the system of freedom and justice we have in our 
country he said 
nelson a lifelong episcopalian was nominated into the 
priesthood by the congregation at all saints episcopal church under 
a church canon that allows the elevation of parishioners to priests 
in remote parishes 
bob is just an exceptional priest and a very humble person 
said the rev stewart c zabriskie the churchs nevada bishop i 
wish i had more like him 
nick aquilina nelsons boss and the manager of the sprawling 
nuclear testing facility northwest of las vegas said nelsons 
honesty had gained him the respect of coworkers as well as that of 
protesters on the other side of the fence 
hes the kind of guy i admire and respect whether he worked 
for me or was on the other side aquilina said i believe he 
comes across in a very credible way because hes so honest ive 
never secondguessed his motives on anything 
zabriskie who said the episcopal church has taken no firm stand 
on nuclear testing views nelson as a bridge builder who is 
able to communicate with both sides on an emotional issue 
i think hes a peacemaker i really do zabriskie said he 
takes a lot of risks and is very vulnerable when he stands up 
before the hostility of some people 
nelson does not criticize antinuclear protesters who often 
congregate at the gates of the test site many are his friends 
including the wife of another episcopal priest in las vegas

personal income growth the government says 
in the plains region nonfarm income grew 69 percent 15 
percentage points below the us average the commerce department 
reported thursday durable manufacturing payrolls grew slower 
than in any other region 
construction and nondurable manufacturing also were weak 
according to the report by the departments bureau of economic 
analysis in each plains state north dakota south dakota 
iowa nebraska kansas missouri and minnesota nonfarm income 
grew slower than the us average 
states in the interior regions generally continued to lag behind 
both coasts in income growth the interior regions averaged a 75 
percent rate while the coastal regions averaged 89 percent 
besides the plains the growth rate in other interior regions 
was 75 percent in the rocky mountain states 77 percent in the 
southwest and 79 percent in the great lakes 
the average growth for the country was 84 percent the 
department said the inflation rate for the 12 months ending in 
june was 52 percent 
the far west led the coastal growth up 96 percent bolstered 
by strength in construction and manufacturing particularly 
aircraft production 
the boeing co is headquartered in washington state and the

needy aids sufferers too ill to continue 
working are finding a reprieve in a michigan program that offers to 
pay their private insurance premiums in order to save the state 
millions of medicaid dollars 
the program is a model for similar programs being developed in 
other states including colorado wisconsin new york and 
california said state rep david hollister who developed the idea 
nine men with acquired immune deficiency syndrome have qualified 
for the twoyear pilot program which was implemented oct 1 in the 
metropolitan detroit counties of wayne oakland and macomb where 
the bulk of the states aids patients live 
assistance is offered to aids patients who had a job but were 
forced to stop working because of illness federal regulations 
allow people who lose their jobs to keep their insurance for up to 
18 months at their own expense but many cannot afford it 
instead of waiting for the patients inevitable fall to medicaid 
status the state can intervene at that point and pay the private 
insurance premium saving more than 1000 per month per person 
officials said 
the cost of treating an aids patient in michigan is about 1600 
a month the average payment for the nine people who have qualified 
is 245 a month said program coordinator denise johnson 
the program could save michigan 4 million by 1991 said 
hollister of lansing 
and its helping aids patients who would hover near the poverty 
level said wellness networks inc executive director barbara 
murray whose organization operates michigans aidsinformation hot 
line 
financially aids is a very devastating disease that can just 
wipe people out just the medication costs alone she said 
to qualify for the program a person must have an income less 
than 1000 per month and cash assets of less than 10000 a 
physician must certify that the persons medical condition makes it 
unlikely he can continue working 
the insurance industry has been cooperative and in three cases 
companies bent the rules and allowed the state to resume payment of 
a policy that had been cut off said hollister 
michigan plans to promote its program through radio commercials 
and advertisements in underground newspapers and gay magazines as 
well as through hospitals and aids advocacy groups said johnson 
as of oct 1 1337 cases of aids had been reported in michigan 
since 1981 791 of whom died during the same period nationally 
109167 cases were reported and 63836 died

the house is turning up the political heat on 
president bush with its overwhelming approval of 837 million in 
aid to poland and hungary over the next three years nearly double 
what the white house asked 
the administration has failed to grasp that this is a critical 
turning point in the history of eastwest relations said rep 
david bonior dmich a member of the democratic leadership 
the aid approved thursday on a 34547 vote is an effort to 
shore up fledgling reform movements in the two soviet bloc 
countries and seize political advantage on the issue from bush 
whose response has been branded timid by congressional 
democrats 
house republicans joined the march in droves the winds of 
freedom and democracy are sweeping across eastern europe and are 
tearing holes in the iron curtain said rep lynn martin rill 
adding the aid package was essential to sustain the reforms 
rep jim leach riowa called it an extraordinarily cheap way 
of helping redirect the course of history 
bush initially proposed 149 million for the two countries when 
he visited eastern europe in july but since then has raised the 
amount to 450 million under pressure from capitol hill 
but the measure that passed the house thursday clearly has made 
the administration uncomfortable it wants to retain leverage to 
make sure economic reforms go forward but doesnt want to be seen 
as reluctant to reward those who are breaking the grip of communism 
in a statement the white house said it would generally support 
the bill but has reservations about the excessive funding 
levels and would work to decrease the amount when the bill goes 
to the senate 
included in the package were a 200 million grant to help 
stabilize polands economy 160 million for poland and 40 million 
for hungary to promote private enterprise 200 million in 
shortterm guarantees and insurance for us exporters selling 
products to the two countries and up to 125 million in food aid 
for poland 
the debate over food aid took up much of the debate time with 
house members arguing over whether to trim an estimated 37 million 
subsidy in the bill for us maritime interests the house voted 
228170 not to cut the requirement that 75 percent of the food be 
shipped on more expensive us vessels 
other money would provide technical training in business skills 
environmental improvements aid to democratic institutions 
cultural exchanges scientific projects and medical aid 
in their first open voting in 40 years poles last june handed 
control of the government to leaders of the solidarity trade union 
a week ago the new government outlined plans for sweeping economic 
reforms 
hungary this year became the first warsaw pact nation to 
physically dismantle the barriers at its borders and allow east 
germans to flee to the west it is developing a new multiparty 
political system under a liberalized constitution and plans 
parliamentary elections early next year 
but economic problems in both countries threaten the reforms 
the polish government faces particularly crucial tests with 
inflation running at an annual rate of 200 percent and climbing 
food shortages and a 39 billion foreign debt burden 
supporters of the aid package said it will help relieve economic 
pressures and buy time for the new leaders to institutionalize 
their reforms while encouraging changes in the rest of eastern 
europe 
citizens in germany romania and czechoslovakia are watching 
what is happening in poland and hungary said rep stephen solarz 
dny if these experiments fail it will stifle the prospects 
for political and economic reform in the other countries he said

environmentalists who failed to stop a senate 
committee from approving james casons nomination to a top natural 
resources post will take their fight against him to the senate 
floor 
we are disappointed we didnt win the committee vote reid 
wilson of the sierraclub said after the agriculture committees 
127 vote thursday in favor of cason but we think it was close 
enough to set up a tight struggle on the senate floor and we are 
going to go all out 
once the senators hear in depth about this mans record they 
are going to be concerned wilson said 
agriculture committee chairman patrick leahy dvt urged a 
vote against cason saying his record in the interior department 
under president reagan showed an unwillingness to protect the 
environment 
but committee republicans joined by democratic sens howell 
heflin of alabama david pryor of arkansas and david boren of 
oklahoma voted to send the full senate casons nomination to be 
assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources 
boren and pryor said however they might vote against cason 
after the floor debate 
sen kent conrad dnd argued against casons confirmation 
and said he might try to block a full senate vote unless he is 
convinced cason can be trusted to protect the public over private 
interests 
conrad criticized casons decision at interior in 1986 to sell 
federal land at fire sale prices of 250 an acre he said the 
government made 17000 on the sale to private interests who weeks 
later resold it for 37 million 
when congress was considering legislation stopping those 
transactions mr cason went to colorado and urged investors to 
file claims before congress acted conrad said 
conrad also said cason cut back on audits of companies buying 
oil from wells on public and indian land he said the change in 
procedures cost the government and the tribes tens perhaps 
hundreds of millions of dollars 
sen richard lugar of indiana the ranking republican on the 
committee said his earlier reservations about cason were answered 
when secretary of agriculture clayton yeutter assured him cason 
would take orders from yeutter 
the committee unanimously approved yeutters nomination earlier 
this year and has supported his work at the agriculture department 
lugar also said he believed cason had become much more sensitive 
to environmental concerns during the committees confirmation 
hearings 
cason appeared before the committee for two days as senators 
questioned him about decisions favoring private interests he made 
while at interior during the reagan administration 
after the hearings leahy called on bush to withdraw the 
nomination 
among other problems leahy said evidence showed cason 
suppressed a report in 1986 that warned of irreversible 
environmental damage including survival of the spotted owl if 
logging was allowed in certain areas of the pacific northwest 
cason said he withheld the report because he wanted more 
information 
cason who has held various high posts at interior since the 
early 1980s would be in charge of the us forest service if 
confirmed he also would oversee conservation programs affecting 
agricultural land

a government audit shows defaults on loans 
from a new federal student financial aid program skyrocketed by 
1664 percent in three years and defaults are getting just as bad 
with borrowers from trade schools 
the general accounting office found loan defaults in the 
supplemental loans to students sls programs increased from 14 
million in fiscal year 1987 to 40 million in 1988 and to 247 
million in 1989 
the amount of sls loans doubled in that time the gao said in a 
report released thursday 
students attending proprietary profitmaking schools 
generally have higher default rates these figures are not 
dissimilar to what we have seen with the other student aid 
programs william gainer director of education and employment 
for the gao 
gainer said more than 32 billion in the supplemental loans to 
students sls program have been guaranteed by nine lenders 
mainly banks credit unions and savings and loan associations in 
the last three years 
students defaulted on 3106 million during that period the 
nine agencies reported 
the sls program enacted in 1986 provides marketrate loans 
higher education students are eligible for an sls loan after first 
meeting more stringent eligibility requirements of other 
governmentguaranteed loans such as pell grants and stafford 
loans formerly called guaranteed student loans 
although the main purpose of the loan is to supplement other 
aid gainer said the audit found 419434 student borrowers received 
only sls loans during the three years compared to 673458 who 
received both sls and stafford loans 
sen edward kennedy dmass and rep pat williams dmont 
requested the gao study 
under the sls program graduate students and those 
undergraduates responsible for their own financial support are 
allowed to borrow up to 4000 per year to a maximum of 20000 
unlike the stafford loans and pell grants eligibility is not based 
on a borrowers financial resources 
sls loans have variable interest rates adjusted annually 
according to treasury department borrowing rates repayment must 
generally begin within 60 days of the last loan disbursement for 
each year a loan is received 
according to the education department the loan volume increased 
from 564 million in the 1987 fiscal year to 1347 billion in the 
1988 fiscal year and dropped slightly to 1294 billion in 1989 
the amount of loans to proprietary or trade school borrowers 
increased from 55 percent to about 60 percent from the 1987 to 1989 
fiscal years the gao found at the same time the amount of loans 
to freshmen borrowers increased from 40 percent of sls loans 1987 
to about 63 percent in the fiscal year that ended sept 30 
loan defaults from freshmen increased from 12 percent of all 
defaults in 1987 to 85 percent in 1989 
similarly defaults from proprietary school borrowers increased 
from 12 percent of sls loan defaults in 1987 to 86 percent in 1989

the 32yearold oakland freeway 
reduced to dust and debris by this weeks earthquake had a history 
of minor problems including some that werent fixed promptly 
according to state inspection reports 
the california transportation department reports made available 
thursday include one from 1966 describing a sagging road deck that 
made it difficult for drivers to control cars 
a 1961 report talked of aboveaverage cracks in several deck 
sections and a 1980 report suggested about 455000 worth of 
repairs such as resealing joints and replacing expansion beams the 
work wasnt immediately done and was suggested again in a 1983 
report 
other problems ranged from hairline cracks and clogged drains to 
auto damage to rails flaking concrete bent spans and a cracked 
girder 
but there was no problem of structural failure at all 
state transportation director robert best said of the reports 
best also said engineers delayed strengthening the section of 
freeway because they believed it would survive a major quake 
we didnt know 10 years ago this was subject to this type of 
earthquake damage we did not know there was any possibility it 
would collapse he said 
best said he was unaware of a private engineers report from 
1975 saying that the section of interstate 880 that collapsed had 
an outdated design that made it vulnerable to such quakes 
ive been assured there were no experts no studies no data 
that suggested in any way that it would fall best said 
a 1milelong stretch of the twotiered interstate also called 
the nimitz freeway collapsed in tuesdays earthquake an upper 
section of the san franciscooakland bay bridge also collapsed 
gov george deukmejian has called for an immediate investigation 
of i880s collapse a commission of bridge engineers is being set 
up to determine why the structure fell and what can be done to 
prevent such tragedies best said 
engineer j david rogers said he determined in his 1975 study 
that the structure wouldnt survive a major earthquake and he said 
the information was presented to state transportation officials at 
that time 
best said it is irresponsible to suggest the state knew the 
structure would collapse he said its possible there were 
unusual subsurface conditions that we didnt know about that 
could have contributed to the collapse the highway was built on 
fill dirt 
rogers blamed the collapse on woodfiber expansion joints on the 
columns that held up the highway the washington post reported 
today 
asked why the late designer of the highway fw panhorst used 
the joints rogers said god only knows it creates a 
tremendous weakness position for the columns 
the failed structure had undergone only the first phase of a 
threestep program to reinforce californias roadways 
work on i880 began in 1977 and was the first improvement since 
the highway was designed in 1954 and constructed in 1957 
but the work on i880 and other roads with doublecolumn 
supports was deferred while officials focused on phase two shoring 
up singlecolumn elevated roadways 
the third phase now under way calls for research with the 
university of california to figure out how to strengthen 
multiplecolumn supports of multilevel elevated highways 
officials maintained that i880 was not neglected or given too 
low a priority in the project 
however john kariotis a south pasadena structural engineer who 
studies earthquakes said the state could have colossally 
reduced the danger by sheathing the columns in steel jackets 
according to the post

dc accompanied by an official from the us embassy in 
guatemala to tell his story 
according to the agent nesbitt left his wife and two children 
near memphis tenn last june leaving behind a note ms cassell 
said read dont look for me im gone nesbitt began an

soviet official feodor temoyev during his travels in bolivia the 
soviet made arrangements for a trip for nesbitt to the soviet union 
he stated to me he had defected ms cassell told the court 
she said nesbitt gave classified communications intelligence 
information to the soviets during his 10day stay in moscow and 
also provided soviet agents with diagrams and charts

some legislative leaders have proposed 
special taxes to pay for earthquake damage and gov george 
deukmejian said he may support a new levy 
if we dont have enough money in terms of what we have on 
hand i have not ruled out the possibility of a tax increase to 
raise whatever funds necessary to bring the communities back to 
normal deukmejian told reporters thursday while touring badly 
damaged santa cruz 
the state has an emergency reserve fund of just over 1 billion 
that can be spent without legislative approval 
tuesdays earthquake has caused well over 4 billion in damage 
according to the state some private economists say it may reach 
10 billion 
assembly speaker willie brown a democrat from san francisco 
has said he would prefer a shortterm increase in the gasoline or 
sales tax to pay for quake repairs 
i dont really think we should be relying on the budget 
reserve to rebuild the bay bridge or the freeway he said of the 
collapsed nimitz freeway in oakland 
brown met thursday with 17 bay arealegislators some of whom 
had their own ideas about how to raise earthquake repair money 
assemblyman dick floyd said there should be a oneyear 
25centpergallon gasoline tax surcharge to raise 35 billion to 
help repair the damage and to strengthen bridges overpasses and 
elevated highways statewide 
deukmejian a republican was scheduled to meet legislative 
leaders including brown on monday 
the governor said there is precedent for a special tax he said 
motor fuel taxes have at times been raised to pay for roads damaged 
in natural disasters 
he said a special legislative session which only he could call 
would be required 
the 17 legislators who met thursday with brown agreed 
unanimously to a special session and said transportation and 
housing needs should be the top priorities 
the lawmakers ended their regular 1989 session in september and 
are not due to return until january

the us government is considering how to 
respond if the kremlin cracks down on freedom movements in the 
baltic republics or if those states gain independence from the 
soviet union says a senior state department official 
the united states has never recognized soviet annexation of 
lithuania latvia and estonia which were occupied by the red army 
during world war ii and that policy has come under new scrutiny 
with the upsurge of independence movements there 
our basic policy of nonrecognition has not changed and it is 
not going to change deputy assistant secretary of state james f 
dobbins testified thursday before the congressional commission on 
peace and security in europe 
activists in the baltic republics encouraged by the reforms of 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev have been campaigning for more 
independence but have drawn sharp warnings from gorbachev and 
other kremlin officials 
we are going to have to develop wellconsidered administration 
responses to this dobbins said many of us who have not been 
experts on the baltic republics are becoming baltic experts 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze assured secretary 
of state james a baker iii at their meeting in wyoming last month 
that the kremlin would not use force against the baltic 
independence movements 
however a private attorney told the congressional panel on 
thursday the approach by the us and other western governments was 
too timid and disorganized to ensure a peaceful solution 
western statesmen have reacted to the resurgence of peaceful 
democratic baltic mass movements with nervous confusion and 
anxiety testified william hough a new york attorney 
not one western state to my knowledge has ever proposed a 
plan for independence for the baltic states or proposed a peaceful 
diplomatic solution for the baltic region that would take into 
account the security interests of nations of eastcentral europe 
including the ussr said hough 
arvydas juozaitis a leader of lithuanias sajudis popular 
front told the associated press recently that his movement expects 
to win a 80 percent majority in elections scheduled for next 
february in lithuania one of 15 soviet republics 
one of the first acts of the lithuanian parliament will be to 
dissolve itself and vote to form a new government independent of 
the soviet union juozaitis said 
lithuania would then seek to establish ties with moscow on the 
basis of a 1939 treaty which affirms lithuanian independence but 
allows the soviet union to maintain military bases in the republic 
to achieve some agreement with moscow we will agree that 
soviet troops can remain in lithuania juozaitis said 
asked whether there was any flexibility in the sajudis position 
juozaitis said i suppose a lot of maneuvering can occur in the 
nearest future before the lithuanian soviet sits 
we are not expecting that the soviets would use force before a 
radical decision is taken they have no argument for using force 
before a decision is taken he said 
one of our most decisive tasks is to win time if we win a 
month we are happy because there are big changes every month he 
said 
the bush administration favors democratic elections to allow 
the baltic peoples do decide these questions themselves dobbins 
told the congressional panel headed by rep steny hoyer dmd 
we the administration and other governments have to consider 
how we can best promote that process he said we are prepared 
to respect and enthusiastically support whatever the results of the 
process of selfdetermination are 
the congressional panel underscored us support for baltic 
independence by hearing testimony from the heads of the estonian 
latvian and lithuanian legations who represent their governments 
in exile 
it was the first time in 35 years the emigre missions had 
testified before congress said the legation heads stasys 
lozoraitis of lithuania anatol dinbergs of latvia and ernst 
jaakson of estonia

lessons learned in a 1983 connecticut 
bridge disaster could provide a blueprint for engineers seeking to 
rebuild a collapsed section of the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge officials say 
the engineers who designed a temporary span on the mianus river 
bridge on interstate 95 are suddenly in demand as are hundreds of 
structural engineers around the country who could reap a windfall 
from the san francisco earthquake 
clem zawodiak director of the connecticut department of 
transportation said thursday that the army corps of engineers had 
asked for the names of contractors and equipment used in the 
reconstruction of the mianus bridge 
a threelane section of southbound i95 collapsed on june 28 
1983 killing three people the accident was blamed on a failed 
hanger system that supported the bridges steel girders 
the highway is a major transportation link between connecticut 
and new york city and is used daily by thousands of commuters 
a twolane temporary span once described as a giant erector 
set was built over the gaping hole in the interstate in 22 days 
on july 22 1983 the temporary span was opened to light traffic 
while the temporary bridge was in place crews worked below to 
construct three new permanent lanes it was the first time such a 
procedure was used to rebuild a bridge the reconstructed bridge 
was opened to traffic in january 1984 
in san francisco a 50foot fivelane section of the upper deck 
of the bay bridge collapsed onto the lower deck during tuesdays 
earthquake the collapse has closed a vital link for those 
commuting between san francisco and oakland 
zawodniak said california transportation officials could 
construct a temporary span similar to the one used on the mianus 
bridge however because the bay bridge has two levels he said he 
wasnt sure if construction could take place while the temporary 
span was in place 
the earthquake which also caused the collapse of a 1mile 
stretch of interstate 880 in oakland has drawn hundreds of 
structural engineers to northern california 
the engineers most of whom are government employees but some 
of whom are private contractors are crawling around buildings 
elevators dams highways bridges pipelines and other structures 
that might have suffered damage 
bill killeen vice president of engineering for acrow corp of 
america which built the temporary mianus river span said his 
company has contacted california transportation officials but he 
declined to say whether his company might become involved in 
reparing the bay bridge 
were sharing ideas with the state killeen said 
acrows bridges use a series of 10by5foot panels connected in 
rows to form trusses beams are placed between them to form a 
bridge deck in addition to mianus the technology was used to 
erect temporary bridges in washington state in the wake of the 
mount st helens volcano in 1980 
peter shugert spokesman for the army corps of engineers in new 
york said the corps solicited information about mianus as a 
courtesy to california officials corps engineers said they didnt 
know if the mianus technology would be applied to the bay bridge 
we were looking for anything that would help them shugert

a major magnetic storm unleashed by a giant 
solar flare is forecast to surge about the earth today possibly 
causing power surges radio blackouts and shimmering lights near 
the poles 
sun watchers at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said the flare erupted on the sun thursday morning 
and almost immediately saturated instruments aboard a noaa 
satellite with xrays 
norman cohen a geophysical forecaster at the space environment 
services center run by noaa in boulder colo said he was sending 
alerts to electrical utilities in canada and in the northern united 
states to expect possible power surges today when a powerful 
magnetic storm is expected to arrive at the earth 
radiation from strong solar flares can affect satellites and 
spacecraft but officials at the national aeronautics and space 
administration said thursday they evaluated the burst of energy and 
determined astronauts on board the orbiting space shuttle atlantis 
are not in danger 
in the orbit were in at 160 miles altitude it is no threat 
at all said ronald d dittemore a flight director at the 
johnson space center in houston were not concerned at all 
a nasa spokesman said galileo the probe released from atlantis 
six hours after the space shuttle was launched wednesday was built 
to resist radiation much stronger than solar flares and will not be 
affected galileo is almost a quartermillion miles from earth on 
its sixyear journey to jupiter 
cohen said the solar flare generated such a strong burst of 
xrays that instruments on noaas goes satellite were overwhelmed 
the satellite detects the radiation up to x12 a term used to 
measure xray flux the flare was estimated to be an x13 
the flare also produced a proton burst that cohen said was about 
1000 times stronger than the flux of protons from a quiet sun 
we measured 2000 particles per cubic centimeter per second 
said cohen a quiet sun will have 2 or 3 particles 
protons are energetic particles than can affect electronic 
equipment in highflying satellites particularly those orbiting 
the poles 
cohen said a major geomagnetic storm should erupt today and 
continue for two days 
energy from such storms can knock out longdistance radio 
transmissions disrupt landline communications and cause power 
surges in unprotected power transmission wires particularly in far 
northern and southern latitudes a similar storm in march caused 
some blackouts in canada 
radio communications over the poles will be wiped out during 
the storm cohen forecast he said an alert was being sent to the 
canadian government 
the flare occurred as solar activity is rising toward the top of 
its current 11year cycle which began in 1986 a flare of similar 
strength was recorded in august 
cohen said the flare erupted from a group of sunspots near the 
center of the solar disc as viewed from earth it will take about a 
week for the sunspot group to move out of view from earth and it 
could produce more major flares 
that would not be surprising said cohen 
solar flares may also produce an aurora the spectacular display 
of shimmering colors over the poles known in the northern 
hemisphere as the northern lights solar storms earlier this year 
created a northern light display visible as far south as denver

there is a sense of triumph amid the death 
and destruction of the earthquake that struck california 
skyscrapers shook but didnt fall trains stopped but most were 
running again within hours businesses closed for a day to assess 
damage then reopened the bay bridge was crippled so thousands of 
commuters switched to ferries 
police and fire officials maintained order hospitals stayed 
open with auxiliary power radio and television kept up a critical 
flow of information to the public 
perhaps most important though the vast majority of people 
didnt panic instead they comforted and helped each other taking 
in neighbors and strangers 
the quake created heroes from a surgeon who rescued a child 
trapped on the collapsed interstate 880 freeway to the thousands 
who worked round the clock coping with the crisis 
if this was a test of the san francisco bay areas ability to 
respond to a major earthquake we got an a says steven levy 
director of the palo altobased center for continuing study of the 
california economy 
there are more than 6 million people in the bay area and a 
couple of hundred people died levy said thursday two days after 
the quake its horrible for the families of victims and 
traumatic for everyone but its not in the realm of a regional 
economic disaster 
certainly there were failures and lessons to be learned 
commuters trapped in a bay area rapid transit train beneath the 
bay when power went out complained they werent given enough 
information by bart officials about the quake 
the san francisco fire department said it was understaffed and 
stretched to the limit in fighting blazes mayor art agnos said he 
was ticked off that vice president dan quayle failed to consult 
with him during a tour of city 
and questions continue about why i880 crumbled and why a 
section of the bay bridge fell like a trap door 
seen from a helicopter though san francisco and oakland remain 
remarkably intact the towers of steel concrete and glass in both 
cities stand tall in defiance of a jolt that sent shock waves 750 
miles up and down the coast and eastward through the central valley 
and sierra nevada 
it speaks a lot for the design code of modern buildings and 
the preparedness of california that there wasnt more damage 
said george lee acting director of the national center for 
earthquake engineering research at the state university of new york 
at buffalo 
the skyscrapers were unharmed lee said because they were 
overdesigned to prevent sway in upper levels and to resist 
powerful wind gusts as much as earthquakes 
i think were going to learn a lot from this event lee 
said many of the buildings have instruments that can determine 
stresses and strains we know the original designs of these 
buildings and we know the ground motion and amplitude adding these 
together will give us a very good picture where the weak links are 
and that will improve designs for the future 
most small buildings and homes throughout the bay area also 
survived with little or no damage unlike those that crumbled in 
soviet armenia when a similar 69 magnitude quake struck last 
december and left 25000 people dead and tens of thousands homeless 
the economic toll of the california quake is already estimated 
at 4 billion and according to frank mccormick a top economist 
for the bank of america in san francisco is likely to reach 10 
billion but that represents only about a months worth of the bay 
areas 125 billion annual economy he said and will be offset 
quickly by a boost to the economy from reconstruction jobs 
insurance payments and federal assistance 
within a day of the quake trucks were moving in and out of the 
port of oakland which handles 1700 vessels a month 
the federal reserve bank of san francisco continued to process 
cash checks and wire transfers without a glitch according to 
a spokesman most large banks used emergency generators to keep 
their computers operating 
san francisco and oakland international airports resumed 
operations wednesday san joses was shut down for only three hours 
tuesday night 
the ultimate triumphs though were personal len jann a 
station agent for bart worked 18 hours day from tuesday afternoon 
until wednesday morning to help people 
we worked the whole night just to make sure people could get 
back across the bay and we stayed with them to make them feel they 
werent alone in this he said 
among those he aided were three women one black one white 
one asian who were stuck in san francisco jann and his 
coworkers watched over the women as they huddled together in the 
bart station until 1 am then drove them to the ferry and 
arranged to have their husbands meet them in oakland 
race origin what they did for a living nothing mattered 
he said these three ladies banded together that was typical of 
how everybody acted the whole bay area banded together and 
survived

after decades of soaring rates of skin cancer 
largely because of suntanning americans finally may be wising up 
to the dangers of the bronzed look a medical researcher says 
rates of malignant melanoma the most deadly form of skin 
cancer appeared to start leveling off in 1988 after 27 years of 
steep rises said dr andrew glass of kaiser permanentes center 
for health research in portland ore 
its going to take some more time to follow that along 
glass said in a telephone interview thursday but early figures 
from the national cancer institute in bethesda md appear to 
indicate a similar leveling off he said 
glass remarks came after he reported on a longterm tracking of 
300000 members of the kaiser permanente prepaid health plan in the 
portland ore and vancouver wash areas 
researchers found that from 1960 to 1987 annual cases of a type 
of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma increased 26 times 
in men and 31 times in women 
squamous cell carcinoma is one of the commonest skin cancers 
occurring in thousands of people each year usually starting as a 
scaly patch on the lip ear or hand it grows spreads and even 
causes death if untreated 
squamous cell skin cancer clearly seems to be related to skin 
exposure it is more common among fairskinned individuals 
especially those with frequent or longterm exposure to sunlight 
said a report by glass and dr robert n hoover of the national 
cancer institute 
their findings represent the first systematic report over time 
of squamous cell skin cancer they said 
the researchers also looked at melanoma and found its incidence 
rose 35fold and 46fold among men and women respectively 
during the same 27year period 
greater exposure to sunlight is only one of many factors 
believed to have contributed to the increased rates of melanoma 
the researchers said in their report in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
but the occurrence of melanomas on the bodys trunk rose much 
faster than cancers involving the head and neck or the extremities 
the researchers said 
these observations are consistent with the impression that the 
rising incidence of both malignancies may be attributable to 
increased voluntary exposure to the sun said the researchers 
malignant melanoma which often starts in an existing mole that 
becomes enlarged is the kind of cancer most likely to spread and 
kill 
researchers found 2453 cases of invasive skin cancers among 
members of the health plan 
the american cancer society has estimated that half of all 
people who live to age 65 will have skin cancer at some point in 
their lives and predicted malignant melanoma will kill 6000 people 
this year 
as individuals and as a society it is only prudent to take 
precautions to save our skins said an editorial in the journal 
by dr martin a weinstock of brown university in providence ri 
he called for preservation of the earths ozone layer which 
blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation and early detection and 
treatment of skin cancers as well as increased public awareness 
and use of sunscreens

doctors cultivating healthy skin in a bed of cow 
protein say the new cell culture technique may allow severely 
burned patients to grow stronger and more resilient skin 
the new technique has the potential of helping thousands of 
severely burned patients said dr john f hansbrough director of 
the burn center at the university of california san diego medical 
center 
when we put this on the patient and it takes and grows 
hansbrough said there are certain structural proteins formed 
that anchor the skin to the body very early and thats the 
real breakthrough 
hansbrough and his colleagues steven t boyce of the university 
of cincinnati medical center and dr matthew l cooper and tanya 
j foreman of ucsd published their findings in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
the researchers said they cultivated areas of skin several times 
the size of the palm of the hand they reported on results in four 
patients who had successful grafts on burns covering from 43 
percent to 74 percent of their bodies 
the new technique shows evidence of allowing a graft to anchor 
to the body within nine days compared with the four weeks to six 
months to a year for cultured human skin cells alone to attach 
fully to the body hansbrough said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
the grafts produced by the new technique also appear to be 
stronger and more resilient at present many fragile grafts from 
cultured skin cells are lost in the laboratory the researchers 
said 
the new technique will take three to five years to develop for 
general use the researchers said it promises to save patients who 
die because doctors are unable to harvest enough healthy skin from 
them before they succumb to infections hansbrough said 
it could also save on medical costs by greatly reducing the 
amount of time patients need to spend in intensive care he said 
at 3000 to 5000 a day for intensive care if we could 
eliminate even one month of hospitalization that would be 
100000 he said 
an editorial accompanying the study acknowledged the new 
skingrafting techniques apparent advantages of rapid anchoring to 
the body and easier handling in the laboratory 
unanswered questions about the new technique include whether it 
promotes faster development of circulation in the graft than those 
in current use and whether the technique will work as well on 
large areas of skin as it does on the small ones used in the study 
the researchers used a latticework of cow or ox collagen a 
protein that is one of the main building materials in animal 
tissues and laced it with human cells of fibroblast connective 
tissue that gives skin its resilience they then placed a layer of 
outer skin cells on top and cultivated the graft in the laboratory 
animal collagen was used because it is readily available and is 
virtually identical at the cell level to human collagen hansbrough 
said

for goldie pennington the earthquake was 
like an intruder who robbed her of her most precious worldly 
possession the place where she and her family lived 
it was like somebody took everything i had and threw me out in 
the streets said mrs pennington 47 lying on a red cross cot 
and keeping a watchful eye on two grandchildren at an emergency 
shelter 
at least we have a roof over our heads and food to eat you 
can always start over mrs pennington said the unexpected can 
happen to anybody rich or poor 
the woman her three children and two grandchildren were unable 
to stay in their city apartment because the earthquake split open 
walls and caused other damage she stayed with a friend for two 
nights before checking into the shelter set up at the moscone 
convention center 
in the city 2555 people are staying in three red cross 
shelters ten thousand people were left homeless in santa cruz 
county according to the state office of emergency preparedness 
most are staying with relatives or in hotels instead of in shelters 
life for the newly homeless consists of bare essentials donated 
meals bottled water restrooms a cot and a blanket or sleeping 
bag 
among the few frills were puppet shows for the kids donated 
stuffed animals chalkboards jigsaw puzzles playing cards and an 
occasional television the red cross dispensed toothbrushes and 
other toiletries 
the moscone center was supposed to have greeted delegates of the 
water pollution control federation before tuesdays quake hit 
instead of exhibitors about 90 families were housed in one hall 
other cots were crammed under escalators and in the crannies of the 
lobby 
people still dont feel safe outside its better to be here 
than to be alone said shelter manager bob puett 
the shelter people were a motley bunch thrown together by 
chance and circumstance those displaced by the quake bunked with 
the citys considerable homeless population who didnt have places 
to lose 
as a way to beat the monotony chris buell worked as a 
volunteer helping people set up their cots showing them locations 
of restrooms and offering a reassuring hand 
everything i have is gone its history im still walking 
around in a daze said buell 28 a professional boxer who 
escaped from his apartment in the marina district with the clothes 
on his back and 5 in his pocket 
im stuck right now so i might as well be helping people 
buell said 
the red cross offered snacks juice fruit and coffee it also 
provided disposable diapers and baby food for fidgety infants such 
as 11monthold hannah watson who was nursed by her mother terri 
it seems like a nightmare said mrs watson 29 whose 
apartment had a big crack in the ceiling and was uninhabitable 
the first feeling was how it seemed like we were cut off from the 
rest of the world i just feel so helpless 
in the middle of the room blanca manzanero entertained her 
three daughters with donated dolls and playthings the woman drove 
into the city to see her lawyer and was trapped when a section of 
the bay bridge collapsed 
she still hasnt built up the nerve to try driving 30 milies 
home to vallejo where her husband is staying 
im so afraid the freeway has a big hole in it i want to wait 
until its safe mrs manzanero said its better to stay here 
its the safest place for me 
in the fashionable marina district 500 families are bunking at 
the marina middle school john and linda reda tossed what they 
could into the back of their blue volvo station wagon and headed 
for the shelter 
i just wanted to have my family albums theyre all my 
memories you can rebuild a house said mrs reda who is five 
months pregnant

house and senate negotiators have endorsed 
legislation guaranteeing 20000 compensation payments to the 
estimated 60000 living japaneseamericans who were rounded up and 
sent to internment camps during world war ii 
the compromise legislation approved thursday which could pay 
the former internees as much as 12 billion over three years must 
next be passed by both houses of congress before being sent to the 
white house for consideration by president bush 
attorney general dick thornburgh has opposed the payments on 
grounds they are too costly bush has not made his position known 
the reparations payments are part of an overall 173 billion 
measure providing appropriations for the commerce state and 
justice departments for the 1990 fiscal year which opened oct 1 
house negotiators accepted the senatepassed version of the bill 
making the reparations payments an entitlement and guaranteeing 
that all of the stillliving internees will receive them 
the senate voted 7422 on sept 29 to waive budget restrictions 
and guarantee the reparations payments are made 
the senate version of the bill which the conference approved 
bars any payments until the beginning of the next fiscal year on 
oct 1 1991 
but it then makes up to 500 million a year available over three 
years until all of the 20000 reparations payments are made

the drug crisis in the nations capital is

and i never had any illusions about the challenges that lay before 
us 
bennett made his remarks while issuing a sixmonth progress 
report on a special initiative he generated to help the district 
of columbia curb its record murder rate and drugrelated crime wave 
so far in 1989 360 persons have been killed in the district 12 
short of the alltime annual record set last year by this time in

a consumer group is charging that merchants 
across the country are handling personal checks and credit card 
transactions in ways that may lead to fraud and invasion of privacy 
the organization bankcard holders of america on thursday 
assailed the practice of many merchants requiring customers who pay 
for purchases with personal checks to provide a major credit card 
number and expiration date plus a telephone number this 
information is then written on the check 
store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their 
bankcard numbers on personal checks but these consumers dont 
realize the potential danger in doing so the groups director 
elgie holstein told a news conference 
he contended that mail order fraud and application fraud are 
increasingly popular crimes and placing this information a cards 
number and expiration date on a personal check enables a thief to 
make purchases or apply for credit in the customers name 
requiring customers to present a major credit card as 
identification or even noting on the check that the consumer holds 
a visa or mastercard can be an appropriate merchant practice 
holstein said it is dangerous however to require credit card 
numbers to be written on checks 
to help consumers deal with this practice the organization is 
making available a walletsized consumer action card to present 
to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal 
checks the wallet card alerts merchants that recording this 
information encourages fraud and may violate a customers privacy

a man seeking to become the nations first 
elected black governor was sharply critical of his opponent for 
invoking the name of slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
jr in a televised debate 
republican j marshall coleman a former state attorney general 
twice referred to king thursday in defending his commitment to 
affirmative action 
what we want is a society that is open to everyone regardless 
of color said coleman who said he worked as a university of 
virginia student to get charlottesville restaurants to desegregate 
coleman said he supported kings view that people should be 
judged on their character and not their skin color 
but democrat l douglas wilder the states lieutenant governor 
said it was almost despicable that coleman linked himself to 
king 
wilder responded angrily that the late gov john n dalton cast 
a veto that you encouraged of a bill creating a state holiday 
to honor king 
the hourlong debate was the candidates final televised debate 
before the nov 7 election 
coleman focused on taxes during the debate what i want to do 
is hold the line on taxes coleman said as a democrat he can 
be expected to raise taxes 
but wilder said he has fought repeatedly to repeal the sales tax 
on food and nonprescription drugs as well as for the pension tax 
relief 
coleman also charged wilder with switching from antideath 
penalty to a procapital punishment stand and with once supporting 
collective bargaining for public employees 
the issue that dominated the first debate abortion hardly was 
mentioned by the candidates 
wilder made a reference in his closing remarks about not 
returning to government interference in the private lives of its 
citizens and at another point said coleman promised his 
antiabortion supporters their views would be represented in 
appointments to state offices 
the debate coincided with the release of a new poll showing 
wilder and coleman virtually in a dead heat the masondixon 
opinion research inc poll showed 45 percent for wilder to 43 
percent for coleman the polls margin of error was 3 percentage 
points either way 
since the last masondixon poll on sept 20 wilder has gained 8 
points and coleman has dropped 1 point

an environmental group says construction 
standards for nuclear power plants should be reexamined in the 
wake of the powerful san francisco bay area earthquake 
there are five active nuclear power plants in california but 
all are in southern california and the nuclear regulatory 
commission says tuesdays quake caused no damage to the nuclear 
reactors 
but ken bossong director of public citizens critical mass 
energy project said nationwide at least two nuclear plants are 
perilously close to known fault lines 
he cited diablo canyon which is southwest of san luis obispo 
calif near the hosgri fault and millstone near the point at 
which the honey hill and lake char fault lines intersect in 
connecticut 
federal regulators should at least view the california 
earthquake as a final warning that seismic standards and testing 
for all nuclear reactors as well as evacuation planning needs to be 
substantially upgraded before the next quake hits said bossong 
the energy department also acknowledges its three active nuclear 
reactors at the savannah river weapons complex in south carolina 
which make materials for nuclear warheads need to undergo seismic 
upgrades he said 
frank ingram an nrc spokesman said the three nuclear reactors 
in california that were running at the time of the quake are still 
running normally 
the five plants in southern california are two at diablo canyon 
and three at san onofre five miles south of san clemente one 
reactor at each site was shut down for normal refueling when the 
quake hit 
under the 1973 standards set by the nrc each nuclear power 
plant must be built to quakeresistance specifications that differ 
according to local seismic conditions the standards for diablo 
canyon are the stiffest in the country ingram said 
the risk of nuclear plant accidents from earthquakes was a major 
point of contention between the industry and environmentalists 
during the 1960s and early 1970s when site planning was done for 
most of the 110 plants now operating in this country 
the chief danger is that a quake would cause a crack in the 
piping that carries cooling water to the reactor core a rapid loss 
of coolant could cause the fuel rods in the core to melt possibly 
allowing radioactive material to escape into the atmosphere

president bush has never told his wife what or 
what not to say the first lady declared 
and she warned hed better not 
barbara bush said what she chose to some 1350 members of new 
yorks elite at the 44th annual alfred e smith memorial dinner 
thursday 
mrs bush who joined a long line of prominent people who have 
addressed the al smith charity said she welcomed the chance to 
prove im more than just a pretty face 
she began her speech by contradicting a published report that 
said she weighs 135140 pounds 
george said the press never gets anything right she said 
i was born weighing 135 pounds 
pausing briefly she turned to outgoing mayor edward i koch 
who was also on the dais and handed him his own favorite line 
howm i doin ed she asked 
the guests paid 500 a plate to dine on filet mignon and 
chocolate hazelnut torte proceeds from the dinner sponsored by

causes 
at last years dinner then vice president george bush and his 
presidential opponent democrat michael s dukakis traded jokes 
just weeks before bush won the race for the white house 
i loved the bonfire of the vanities mrs bush told this 
years glittering gathering referring to tom wolfes satirical 
look at new york politics and race relations 
but i never dreamed id get to address some of the characters

elected black governor was sharply critical of his opponent for 
invoking the name of slain civil rights leader martin luther king 
jr in a televised debate 
republican j marshall coleman a former state attorney general 
twice referred to king thursday in defending his commitment to 
affirmative action 
what we want is a society that is open to everyone regardless 
of color said coleman who said he worked as a university of 
virginia student to get charlottesville restaurants to desegregate 
coleman said he supported kings view that people should be 
judged on their character and not their skin color 
but democrat l douglas wilder the states lieutenant governor 
said it was almost despicable that coleman linked himself to 
king 
wilder responded angrily that the late gov john n dalton cast 
a veto that you encouraged of a bill creating a state holiday 
to honor king 
the hourlong debate was the candidates final televised debate 
before the nov 7 election 
coleman focused on taxes during the debate what i want to do 
is hold the line on taxes coleman said as a democrat he can 
be expected to raise taxes 
but wilder said he has fought repeatedly to repeal the sales tax 
on food and nonprescription drugs as well as for the pension tax 
relief 
coleman also charged wilder with switching from antideath 
penalty to a procapital punishment stand and with once supporting 
collective bargaining for public employees 
the issue that dominated the first debate abortion hardly was 
mentioned by the candidates 
wilder made a reference in his closing remarks about not 
returning to government interference in the private lives of its 
citizens and at another point said coleman promised his 
antiabortion supporters their views would be represented in 
appointments to state offices 
the debate coincided with the release of a new poll showing 
wilder and coleman virtually in a dead heat the masondixon 
opinion research inc poll showed 45 percent for wilder to 43 
percent for coleman the polls margin of error was 3 percentage 
points either way 
since the last masondixon poll on sept 20 wilder has gained 8 
points and coleman has dropped 1 point 
the current governor democrat gerald l baliles is barred by 
the state constitution from seeking a second consecutive term

many people hoping to buy the freddy krueger 
doll based on the ghoulish character in nightmare on elm 
street movies may be able to purchase it only in their dreams 
the rev donald wildmon whose american family association had 
urged a boycott of the doll announced thursday that the matchbox 
toy company informed him it would not proceed with plans to market 
the doll 
we feel that the decision by matchbox is a very positive and 
socially responsible one and we commend them for their decision 
wildmon said in disclosing the toy companys action 
matchbox better known for tiny toy cars confirmed that it 
decided to drop its plans at least temporarily for marketing a 
doll version of the movie fiend who has blades for fingernails and 
kills his victims in their dreams 
matchbox will not advertise or promote the doll in any way 
said a spokeswoman for matchbox toys usa ltd 
the doll announced last month had been expected to be a hot 
seller ahead of halloween 
but matchbox has not decided on the dolls ultimate fate 
as far as 1990 goes i dont think any decision has been 
made said the spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
wildmon said he was told by matchbox that about 40000 dolls 
already being shipped will not be halted but orders for another 
160000 dolls will not be filled 
the matchbox spokeswoman could not confirm the figures but said 
orders for the doll significantly exceed the number of dolls 
already assembled 
wildmons american family association which has backed boycotts 
of tv programs it considers offensive had called for a boycott of 
the freddy krueger doll immediately after it was announced last 
month 
wildmon had called the freddy krueger doll a product of a sick 
mind 
the tupelo missbased group also had urged a boycott of stores 
that stocked the doll and a boycott of all other toys made by 
matchbox

three ministers called to testify 
against a man who confessed during a church service to robbing his 
uncles store are claiming that requirement would violate their 
right to freedom of religion 
were not in the business of putting people in jail were in 
the business of repenting them shirley hiles one of the 
ministers at the word of deliverance church said thursday 
morgan county judge thomas steptoe jr on monday refused to 
quash a subpoena for mrs hiles 50 her husband jack hiles 50 
and wilda maconaughay 54 
they were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of larry yost who 
is charged with breaking and entering steptoe postponed the trial

broken into his uncles store yost was arrested in january and has 
been in jail since on 25000 bail 
yost allegedly stole 3700 worth of material from yost building 
supply inc 
the ministers whose church advocates the public confession of 
sins said their jail ministry program has been hurt because 
inmates are afraid that what they say will be used against them 
this will stop the function of our church mrs hiles said 
we might as well close the doors because people wont be able to 
be born again 
ive heard many public confessions from all kinds of good 
people who have repented her husband said a lot of them could 
have been dragged into court but they became good people again 
valuable people 
if convicted yost could be sentenced to life in prison without 
parole under the states repeat offender law because he has two 
previous convictions

county jail broke into a bar across the street and stole a keg of 
beer which they carried back to their cells and had a party

a study by black researchers into the plight of 
black americans provides more insight and policy recommendations 
than a far more expensive report conducted mostly by whites says a 
sponsor of the new study 
historically blacks have been treated as objects of study 
rather than as major participants in conducting a study said 
wornie reed director of the william monroe trotter institute for 
the study of black culture at the university of massachusetts at 
boston 
many studies say black people are unemployed he said we 
looked at why theyre unemployed 
the study a summary volume of which was released thursday was 
commissioned by the trotter institute and cost about 100000 
race continues to matter according to the report 
discrimination persists although its forms have altered 
the study titled assessment of the status of 
africanamericans was conducted by academics around the country 
in response to another controversial study of blacks by the 
national research council released last summer that was conducted 
mostly by whites at a cost of 2 million 
that study called a common destiny blacks and american 
society found that blacks made great strides in the last 50 
years but were losing ground in such areas as economic and 
educational status at the time the national research council study 
was announced in 1984 some black scholars protested their omission 
from the study 
reed acknowledged thursday that the basic findings of the 
trotter study did not differ greatly from the previous report he 
said he believes some of the protests by black scholars may have 
contributed to the fairness of the national research council 
study but he said the trotter report questioned how society 
contributes to the status of blacks today 
they talked about cultural poverty but we go even further to 
explain why there is such a problem and make policy 
recommendations said reed 
the trotter report calls for more federal assistance to black 
students strengthening black families and stimulating economic 
growth expanding child care and other federal aid programs bail 
reform cultural sensitivity training for judges and others in the 
criminal justice system and recruiting more blacks for the health 
professions 
the report found that racial discrimination impedes blacks 
access to health care higher education and jobs and is present in 
the criminal justice system 
among the specific findings 
during 1985 and 1986 life expectancy for blacks dropped the 
first consecutive decline this century the average life expectancy 
for blacks dropped to 694 years in 1986 while whites increased to 
an alltime high of 75 years 
in 1984 the average black family had a net worth of 3400 
compared with 39000 for a white family 
minority youths are imprisoned three to four times more than 
white youths and receive stiffer sentences

a liszt piano variation linked to misfortune 
and death for more than 150 years was presented by a set of twins 
this time without a hitch 
the 800member audience rose to its feet thursday night to 
applaud the performance by john and richard contiguglia of franz 
liszts great concert piece on mendelssohns songs without 
words the 52yearold twins are credited with discovering the 
piece in 1973 
liszt the hungarian composer wrote the variation on 
mendelssohns music in 1835 he collapsed at the keyboard during 
the premiere of the piece that year 
the contiguglias who hail from this central new york town but 
live in new york city were scheduled to play the music saturday 
night but the concert was canceled when a violent thunderstorm 
plunged the east middle school auditorium into darkness 
pianist ferrucio busone died shortly before a performance of the 
piece in 1924 
in 1986 the contiguglia brothers planned to perform it at a 
liszt festival in holland but the dutch government seized the 
sheet music claiming it held a coded spy message being passed from 
east germany to the west 
its uncanny how many times something has prevented this song 
from being played richard contiguglia said

the physical aftershocks that followed 
northern californias monster quake havent let up and authorities 
say the psychological shockwaves are just beginning 
we are getting people who are starting to call in now with 
some of the things we expected to have follow this earthquake 
eve myer executive director of the san francisco suicide 
prevention hotline said thursday 
were seeing the depression that sets in after the adrenalin 
dies down and when the television stories about the quake start 
to repeat themselves 
the usual load of 200 calls a day is up at least 10 percent 
since the quake myer said the first wave of callers 
generally elderly people who felt particularly vulnerable is 
giving way to a second group that seems exceptionally confused by 
overpowering feelings of sadness and gloom she said 
many callers are reporting trouble sleeping sensing the 
incredible fright caused by the temblor all over again and they 
appear to be linking the earthquake to other traumatic events in 
their lives and intensifying their discomfort she said 
myer said she understands how they feel 
when she couldnt find her husband immediately after tuesdays 
earthquake she felt tension and frustration she said she later 
realized she had unconsciously associated the events with her 
mothers unsuccessful search for her husband in nazi germany 
that old story bubbled up in my head and i didnt realize i 
was reliving a war i had never been in and thats happening to 
other people too she said this will happen more and more 
thats a fairly natural thing 
thats one reason the city is sending special mental health 
teams to help some of the newly setup homeless shelters 
its like the rug is pulled out from under you the firm 
stance you have in the world gets shaken said psychologist 
daniel weiss of langley porter psychiatric institute at the 
university of california san francisco 
it forces you to confront your own mortality that you dont 
live forever that bad things happen to good people sometimes for 
no reason at all weiss said thursday 
dr lenore terr a san francisco psychiatrist said area 
residents expect earthquakes so it may not be as traumatizing as 
other disasters 
but for those who are severely distressed symptoms include 
jumpiness irritability nightmares emotional numbness and 
detachment recurrent images of disaster difficulty concentrating 
and sleeping and fear of entering buildings or doubledeck 
freeways like the one in oakland that collapsed 
people who survived unscathed often display disbelief of 
surrounding destruction followed by relief then guilt that they 
lived while others died weiss said for those who had relatives 
die or homes destroyed questions arise like why me what did i 
do to deserve this 
there is no one to get angry at and sometimes feelings of 
anger at having been victimized are put onto other innocent 
people 
children are vulnerable too 
those younger than age 3 may be a little bit more anxious a 
little more clingy if their parents are upset their children will 
be upset said dr glen elliott director of child and adult 
psychiatry at langley porter 
some help has come from computer communication systems 
prodigy a white plains nybased venture of ibm and sears 
roebuck amp co had a system going less than four hours after 
tuesdays quake said brian ek communications manager 
it also put a psychologist on line wednesday night to help 
these people deal with the trauma we had one person who know some 
of the people involved in the nimitz highway situation who was 
pretty distraught ek said by thursday afternoon 1530 messages 
were posted 
compuserve the columbus ohio based computer information 
service with 550000 individual and 1800 corporate customers 
worldwide has created an earthquake forum where people 
concerned about whats happening to loved ones and friends in the 
wake of the quake can leave messages and information

an innercity grocery store is asking 
shoppers to pay a quarter deposit to be part of its carriage trade 
hoping to keep shopping carts where they belong waldbaums on 
main street has been testing the deposit system since tuesday the 
cart handles have been fitted with a locking mechanism with a key 
on a heavy chain that connects to the lock on the next cart in line 
shoppers must slip a quarter into the lock to release their 
cart when they return the cart and fit the key from its 
neighboring cart back in again a quarter pops back out 
store manager bob foote said the lockup system is widely used in 
canada 
being an innercity store weve got quite a problem with 
losing carriages foote said id estimate that last year we 
spent 25000 on them we spend maybe 60 hours a week at 5 or 6 
an hour just shagging the lot for carriages 
in addition waldbaums pays a woman with a pickup truck 100 a 
week to scout out wayward carts 
though a 25cent deposit will not stop a determined thief foote 
said he hopes it will encourage young people in particular to bring 
back any stray carts they find 
not all customers have been as receptive to the deposits as the 
store manager 
its a hassle getting a quarter sheryl mcgee said thursday 
you might not have one

a 7yearold girl whose need for a new liver 
as an infant helped spur the nations organ transplant policy has 
been discharged from the university of minnesota hospital 
she left thursday afternoon though doctors remained unsure what 
caused a bout of internal bleeding she will stay in the area with 
her parents at least until the middle of next week hospital 
spokeswoman mary stanik said 
doctors on oct 9 removed the youngsters enlarged spleen in the 
belief that it had caused three bouts of internal bleeding within a 
month she was discharged on saturday but was readmitted the 
following day when she suffered more bleeding several hours after 
leaving the hospital 
stanik said jamie has had no more bleeding since reentering the 
hospital 
jamie was born nov 26 1981 with biliary atresia a condition 
in which the livers bile ducts are blocked 
she received a liver at the university of minnesota in 1982 a 
few days after her father charles fiske made a televised appeal 
for a donor during a convention at the american academy of 
pediatricians 
doctors during the spleen removal surgery were able to examine 
jamies liver and said it and her other organs were normal stanik 
said doctors do not think the liver has anything to do with the 
girls current problems 
stanik said jamies spirits are good although she still hopes 
to return to her bridgewater mass home in time for halloween 
she seems to be handling things quite well stanik said

among those subpoenaed sources familiar with the investigation 
told the associated press on thursday was phoenix attorney neal 
roberts a figure in the original bolles investigation 
the sources demanded anonymity saying they feared prosecution 
under an arizona law making it a crime to disclose grand jury 
matters 
roberts 60 did not return a call from the ap but was quoted in 
todays editions of the arizona republic as confirming that he had 
been served with the subpoena by aides to attorney general bob 
corbin

local mexican officials may have given 
protection to two colombian drugrunners linked to the medellin 
cocaine cartel and arrested in the southern yucatan federal police 
say 
federal officials on thursday announced their capture of the 
nephews of two major colombian drug kingpins saying they had 
broken up a ring that flew cocaine into mexico and shipped it by 
boat to florida 
the colombians and eight other men were captured sunday at a 
clandestine airstrip in the yucatan peninsula said federal police 
commander fausto valverde head of the narcotics interdiction 
forces 
we imagine they made an arrangement for protection valverde 
said he said police were investigating the matter 
two other men were captured in the resort city of cancun 
valverde said 
authorities said they waited to announce the arrests because 
they had hoped to capture more accomplices they said they were 
searching for another colombian suspect 
valverde also said that an airplane carrying drugs to cancun 
escaped when someone on the ground warned it by radio that mexican 
police were at the clandestine airstrip 
captured were ringleaders luis alfredo aguilar castro a nephew 
of gonzalo rodriguez gacha and ricardo isunza ochoa a nephew of 
fabio ochoa according to valverde 
fabio ochoa and rodriguez gacha known as el mexicano 
because of his interest in mexican culture are top members of the 
medellin cartel and are among the worlds mostwanted drug 
traffickers 
valverde said aguilar and isunza ochoa were their uncles direct 
representatives in the smuggling operation 
he said he did not know whether the two were wanted in colombia 
or the united states on drugrelated charges asked whether the two 
might be extradited to the united states valverde answered 
anything is possible 
commander miguel rodriguez lorrabaquio said the group brought 
cocaine from colombia by air to mexico then shipped it by boat to 
the united states usually to florida 
colombias medellin and cali cocaine cartels account for an 
estimated 80 percent of cocaine shipped to the united states 
traffickers in that south american country have operated with 
relative impunity over the years by intimidating or paying off 
judges 
but on aug 19 the colombian government declared war against 
cocaine barons after traffickers assassinated the countrys leading 
presidential candidate that included seizing the property of 
alleged traffickers and reinstating an extradition treaty with the 
united states 
in response cocaine barons began a bombing and terror campaign 
in colombia

beijing lawmakers have called for jails to be 
built to house prostitutes and severe punishment including the 
death sentence for anyone who induces or coerces women into 
prostitution 
the official xinhua news agency said today the municipal 
government was discussing a draft bill to give the capital its 
first antiprostitution statutes 
it quoted liu changyi deputy director of the beijing public 
security bureau as saying prostitution had reemerged in the city 
and evolved fairly quickly since the early 1980s 
liu gave no figures except to say there were many more people 
involved in prostitution now than in 1985 when there were about 
100 cases 
he that only four cases of syphilis and other sexually 
transmitted diseases were discovered in 1984 compared to about 
1000 last year 
the draft regulations call for the city to set up a penitentiary 
for those involved in prostitution and enforce strict punishment 
including the death sentence for procurers 
foreigners involved in prostitution will be punished according 
to the law and those with sexually transmitted diseases expelled 
from the country according to the regulations 
the communist government nearly succeeded in eliminating 
prostitution after taking over in 1949 but the practice has 
returned in recent years with the countrys increased exposure to 
the outside world 
prostitution has made its strongest comeback in canton and other 
cities of southern china that are influenced by neighboring hong 
kong two canton men were executed in 1987 for running a 
prostitution ring 
china has national laws against prostitution but penalties are 
generally light according to a 1986 law women caught selling 
sexual favors are detained for less than 15 days or in more 
serious cases sent to labor reform camps

pavulon a muscle relaxant to patients at good samaritan hospital 
in 1987 he worked at the hospital in the long island town of west 
islip for six months as a nurse 
prosecutor john colins called angelo a monster dressed in 
nurses whites and the living embodiment of your worst 
nightmare 
colins said angelo first experimented on mice and then moved on 
to terribly vulnerable human beings for his stated purposes of 
improving his image and reputation 
police say angelo admitted in written and videotaped confessions 
that he gave the injections to patients with the intention of 
reviving them so he would look like a hero 
kucich testified that a bearded man in a white medical coat came 
into his hospital room one day and asked him how he was feeling 
the former patient said that when he responded not bad the 
man opened his coat took out a needle and told him this will 
make you feel much better 
angelo then injected the drug into his intravenous tube and left 
the room said kucich 
i became like dead said kucich 
he managed to press the emergency alarm and his regular nurse 
lauren ball came in and helped revive him 
kucich said he still couldnt talk or see moments later when he 
heard angelo return to the room he gestured towards angelos 
voice hoping mrs ball would catch on 
according to kucich mrs ball asked angelo what did you do 
kucich said angelo answered nothing and left the room 
mrs ball was scheduled to testify today when the trial resumes 
as kucich spoke angelo sat at the defense table with his eyes 
downcast his parents alice and joseph angelo retired 
schoolteachers who recently moved to florida sat behind him 
kucich of yugoslavia was visiting his children when he was 
hospitalized for a heart attack in 1987 he returned for the trial 
twentytwo patients bodies were exhumed during the 
investigation pavulon poisoning was found in six bodies but could 
be established as a cause of death in only four the other two 
cases resulted in assault charges against angelo the third assault 
charge is for the attack on kucich the only known survivor 
angelos attorney eric naiburg admitted that angelo gave the 
injections but he asked the jury to consider a lesser charge than 
seconddegree murder

newton hazell looked on his dresser in his desk 
drawers and under his mattress before he remembered the cookie jar 
which was where hed unknowingly stuffed a 13 million winning 
lotto ticket last year 
i just stuck it in and forgot all about it said hazell who 
overcame the memory lapse to become a millionaire just four days 
before his ticket would have become worthless 
hazell a correction officer showed up wednesday at the lottery 
offices to collect his prize from the oct 22 1988 drawing 
isnt that something this was down to the nittygritty 
another week and i would have lost it said hazell of metuchen 
nj after a thursday news conference announcing his sweet find 
hazell 58 bought the winning ticket at the towne and country 
deli on new york citys staten island selecting the numbers 7 9 
13 21 34 and 43 but he dumped the ticket into the cookie jar and 
never checked to see if he won 
last week hazell noticed a sign in the deli telling lotto 
players to check their tickets because a 13 million prize was 
still unclaimed a newspaper article pinned next to it showed the 
missing ticket contained his weekly numbers 
i looked everywhere because i saw my numbers i went through 
dressers drawers under the mattress i went through a bag where i 
throw all my losing tickets said hazell 
finally he had a feeling about the cookie jar and went to check 
it out there it was all by itself winners have one year to 
produce their tickets hazell showed up with just four days to 
spare 
state lottery spokesman bill knowlton said this was the longest 
anybody had ever waited to claim a prize two other people picked 
winning numbers in the drawing and both had already claimed their 
shares of the 4 million jackpot 
hazell whose winning numbers combined his birthday 
anniversary daughters age and license plate number said the 
windfall wont have any immediate effect on his lifestyle 
im not going to retire im a young 58 going on 25 he

prosecutors charged a 12yearold boy with 
manslaughter in the shotgun slaying of his 7yearold sister 
although they said the shooting was an accident 
prosecutor danny dawson said the boy marvin williams was 
grossly negligent in deliberately aiming a shortbarreled shotgun 
that killed calandra graham 
if at the time a gun goes off youve got control of the gun 
and youre pointing it at another individual that crosses the 
threshold of culpable negligence said dawson 
marvins mother mattie williams said when told of the charge 
wednesday i dont understand it but we will deal with it we 
will deal with it 
the two children were alone at home at the time of the sept 13 
shooting and the boy told investigators conflicting stories of 
what happened said state attorneys spokesman randy means 
investigators later determined that marvin took the gun from an 
unlocked cabinet in his 18yearold brothers bedroom and played 
with it for a few minutes around the house before returning to the 
bedroom to put it away 
when he saw his sister means said the boy pointed the gun and 
told her something to the effect of dont worry its not 
dangerous 
the gun then went off blasting the girl in the face 
means said the boys conduct was so careless that it rises to 
the level of culpable negligence the standard used to prove 
manslaughter 
in a similar case in orlando in june 10yearold scott feltner 
was shot and killed by 13yearold barry mcdonald who was not 
charged but mcdonald was not paying attention to where he was 
aiming the gun when it went off dawson said 
means said prosecutors have not decided whether to charge marvin 
williams 18yearold brother efrem bolden with illegal 
possession of the shotgun used in the girls death a state law 
which took effect in october penalizes the owner of a weapon left 
where it can be easily obtained by children

a collapsed freeway has drawn most of the 
attention in the earthquakes aftermath but the temblor also 
caused 13 billion worth of damage elsewhere in the city 
according to mayor lionel wilson 
among the buildings found uninhabitable was city hall an ornate 
structure built in 1911 crucial city services have been relocated 
the buildings historic value makes it an obvious candidate for 
repair according to linda schroff emergency services coordinator 
for the city 
but its difficult to assess at this point whether they could 
repair it to the point where it was real safe or they would have to 
take it down she said depending on the assistance we get from 
the federal government they will or will not make it a safe place 
to be 
the historic amtrak railroad station in west oakland may have to 
be torn down after the discovery of three big cracks running 
through the structure officials said 
one more good shake and the whole thing would have come 
down said amtrak employee ron young 
some city staff members including the city managers office 
have moved operations from city hall to the fire department 
the section of interstate 880 that buckled in tuesdays 
earthquake trapped an undetermined number of drivers inside rescue 
workers continued efforts around the clock in hope of finding 
survivors 
elsewhere in the city workers inspected damaged buildings 
hardhit was the downtown area the earthquake caused enough damage 
to require the replacement of 1400 residential units worth 294 
million schroff said more than 100 elderly people whose homes 
were destroyed have gone to shelters she said 
thirteen commercial buildings worth 234 million must be 
replaced and 200 buildings suffered damages totaling another 750 
million a dozen public buildings including city hall suffered 
250 million in damages 
modern buildings suffered along with the old including one 
structure under construction as part of the city center project 
girders at the top of 14 stories of framework were askew and part 
of a fallen construction elevator lay crumpled on the ground 
i certainly didnt expect we would have that much damage with 
a 70 earthquake its shocking and upsetting said oakland city 
council member dick spees 
city government should be fully operational within four or five 
days but it will take months before the city is back to normal he 
said 
the oakland museum sustained quite a bit of damage to 
artifacts and early california exhibits in the history wing 
according to museum spokesman phil mumma 
along broadway the heart of downtown most of the broken glass 
has been swept from the sidewalks but police tape and temporary 
cyclone fences kept people away from damaged buildings where bricks 
and windows had fallen 
david johnson an assistant to the mayor said the earthquake 
will not hurt the momentum of the citys revitalization effort 
it may slow us down a little but only a little he said

dan rather thought the 48 hours 
earthquake broadcast was going well enough then a disturbance 
broke out offcamera interrupting the live show 
designed to report the news both quickly and with a personal 
spin 48 hours was handed a perfect finale thursday just a few 
feet from the cbs cameras the father of a man believed killed on 
collapsed interstate 880 was accusing the oakland mayor of 
negligent homicide 
it was a telling moment anchorman rather said in an 
interview after the show it said a lot about fears and 
frustrations and what happens to people in situations like this 
when you talk about earthquake victims you have to remember 
thats one person at a time what gets drowned out in a lot of 
newscasts on a story like this is the story of one person one 
person like mr rubis son up there in the wreckage 
thats something i and a lot of other people can relate to 
daniel rubi assailed mayor lionel wilson during an evening news 
conference in front of interstate 880 saying that wilson was 
directly responsible for my sons death rubi said his son juan 
28 was killed because wilson had failed to maintain the freeway 
the younger rubis body is not among those recovered from the 
wreckage so far 
the elder rubi profiled on 48 hours shortly before his 
outburst was taken from the scene in a police squad car but not 
arrested authorities said 
for the weekly news magazine the rubi incident was an 
unfortunate but nevertheless valuable break like the other 
networks and media organizations swarming around the bay area cbs 
news has labored to find fresh ways to tell a complex story 
the first problem you have is getting on the air in the first 
place said don decesare vice president of news coverage for 
cbs he cited an array of logistical problems from no telephones 
to no onsite editing bays and a shortage of mobile broadcast 
facilities 
one danger of incorporating journalists themselves in the news 
accounts and importing highticket anchors like rather nbcs tom 
brokaw and abcs peter jennings is that they can become as much a 
part of the story as the story itself 
andrew heyward the executive producer of 48 hours said the 
arrival of the network stars was only a reflection of the storys 
importance 
there is an advantage for the anchor to be in the city its 
certainly better than in the studio heyward said 
yet when abcs jennings arrived at the scene just the opposite 
was true 
jennings pulled into the destroyed freeway scene on wednesday 
morning and minutes later delivered a live dispatch that 
demonstrated the hazards of capturing the story both quickly and 
accurately 
jennings said rescue workers had labored through the night to 
save lives on the collapsed freeway 
anyone who had spent the earlymorning hours there however 
would have said very little happened after midnight

a ferry boat armada is being prepared as 
transit officials brace for a monumental traffic jam on san 
francisco bay area freeways monday when most workers return to 
their jobs in the quakeravaged region 
some roads already have been gripped by gridlock despite fewer 
commuters in the aftermath of tuesdays quake which shut down the 
vital bridge linking san francisco to oakland and the rest of the 
east bay 
ferry boats may relieve some of the pressure on the highways 
weve got three days to get ready for monday with as much of 
an armada as possible state sen quentin kopp said at an 
emergency meeting of the metropolitan transportation commission on 
thursday 
i dont see much alternative to water over the next couple of 
weeks while the san franciscooakland bay bridge is repaired 
kopp said a 50foot section of the bridge collapsed during the 
quake and could take up to two months to repair 
kopp said some 45 vessels ranging from elegant dining cruise 
boats to navy landing craft could be pressed into service to carry 
up to 60000 commuters across the waters kopp said 20 navy boats 
were made available by the 12th naval district 
but that still leaves at least 50000 additional commuters who 
normally take the bridge 
itll get bad monday said george gray deputy district 
director for public transportation at the california department of 
transportation 
he encouraged people to stay home and work through personal 
computers or to adopt flexible work hours 
on thursday about 60 percent of the usual number of commuters 
struggled to reach work by train boat or car many found 
themselves in traffic jams some arrived at buildings still in the 
dark or with only partial power others turned back after facing up 
to fourhour delays on the overburdened highways 
people are just trying to get back to reality to make life 
like it was before said steve tomberlin of traffic central a 
private traffic information service 
some commuters from the east bay took a circuitous route south 
to the san francisco peninsula and then north to san francisco that 
added hours to the average hourlong drive they would have taken 
across the bay bridge 
those who took the northern route across the san 
rafaelrichmond bridge to marin county and then across the golden 
gate bridge faced delays of up to 90 minutes 
bay area rapid transit has restored full operations for the 
morning commute but it appeared that few carlovers were switching 
to the subterranean train line 
system analyst joan nomara said the passenger load typically 
about 50000 people each way on weekdays was around 70 percent on 
thursday 
bart also announced roundtheclock service would begin monday 
the system is usually shut between midnight and 6 am

police hauled a prominent human rights 
campaigner from his prague home before dawn today holding him for 
several hours one day after detaining 15 opposition activists in 
another raid an emigre source said 
jan urban a leading member of the charter 77 human rights 
movement and other prodemocracy groups was taken from his home by 
police at 530 am said the source who asked not to be 
identified 
sources in prague said urban was released abouutu four hours 
later after apparently being warned not to engage in further 
dissident activity 
jiri hajek czechoslovakias foreign minister during the 1968 
prague spring was among those arrested thursday and held for 
several hours by police who raided a meeting the activists were 
holding with international human rights campaigners us human 
rights monitor jeri laber also was briefly detained 
police have made at least three other police raids on activists 
over the past week 
czechoslovakias communist authorities unlike their 
counterparts in neighboring hungary and poland have firmly 
rejected dialogue with opposition groups who seek a more open 
society 
a wave of prodemocracy demonstrations in january has been 
answered with carefully targeted harassment of leading activists 
and the jailing of lesser known campaigners whose detention stirs 
less protest at home and abroad 
the current wave of harassment may be connected with the 
upcoming oct 28 anniversary of czechoslovakias independence in 
1918 
last year about 5000 peaceful demonstrators gathered at a 
banned rally to mark the anniversary and were dispersed by police 
using water cannon tear gas dogs and batons 
the communist party daily rude pravo has already warned that 
anybody attending a similar rally this year could face prosecution

victims of a series of deadly earthquakes in 
rural northern china said today they owed their lives to an initial 
temblor that sent them fleeing from their homes before a second 
brought the dwellings crashing down 
at least 29 people died and more than 10000 homes were reported 
destroyed by the quakes the regions worst in 13 years 
the official china daily said more than 150 people were injured 
many seriously in the quakes that hit shanxi and hebei provinces 
late wednesday and early thursday 
the temblors centered about 135 miles west of beijing measured 
up to 61 on the richter scale and were felt in the capital 
this was the worst quake weve ever had liu rongzhen a 
peasant farmer in xicaitian village told a western reporter i 
was asleep in the house when the first quake woke me up it rocked 
the walls and we went outside with the second quake the house 
collapsed 
about half the mud and wattle homes in the impoverished dusty 
town of 820 were heavily damaged a short distance away in bucun 
a village of 1280 not one home was left standing 
people there also said the first quake which hit with a 
magnitude of 57 shortly before 11 pm wednesday drove them from 
their homes which toppled when the 61 quake hit two hours later 
it was like waves some in the walled village said it was 
very loud 
two bucun villagers a man of about 60 and his octogenarian 
mother were killed as he carried her from the house 
two plain wooden caskets with straw covers were set up in their 
home which was open to the sky with the walls only partly 
standing a neighbor wailed as she viewed the caskets at the head 
of which biscuits were placed in an apparent religious offering 
many people spent thursday night huddled around campfires and 
sleeping in makeshift straw tents temperatures dipped to near 
freezing on the treeless brown plain and people were wrapped in 
heavy greatcoats 
one woman was seen cleaning her now roofless home around the 
tent she had set up inside 
today some people rummaged through the destruction others sat 
on the rubble doing nothing 
residents said that in winter temperatures dip as low as 22 
below zero on the exposed plain which ranges up to 4000 feet 
above sea level they said it would be impossible to rebuild their 
homes before then 
district officials inspected the damage but no outside 
assistance had arrived to lead relief operations 
raw film footage from the shanxi provincial television seen in 
beijing today showed rescue workers armed only with shovels and 
wooden poles digging through the rubble of destroyed homes looking 
for victims 
the film showed medical personnel treating people with badly 
bloodied heads and broken bones in temporary outdoor clinics 
people dressed in overcoats huddled around bonfires children 
wrapped in colorful blankets slept in piles of hay 
most of the stricken area is populated by peasants who scrape 
wheat corn and other grain crops out of the infertile deeply 
eroded soil 
in many places only crumbled mud walls and the blue arched and 
latticed wood doorways common to the area remained standing 
the film showed bread and medical supplies being delivered to 
damaged areas the china daily said 1000 soldiers were mobilized 
to help in the rescue operation 
officials in datong a major coal mining and rail center of 
about 500000 in northern shanxi said the city escaped serious 
destruction they said the quakes had not damaged datongs famous 
yungang caves which hold thousands of buddhist paintings and 
statues dating back to the 5th century 
the first quake struck about 20 hours after the devastating 
temblor in san francisco but seismologists said there was no 
apparent link between the two 
there were at least six quakes registering 50 or more on the 
richter scale and the last major aftershock of 51 was recorded 
at 629 pm thursday 
people within a radius of 300 miles felt the shocks residents 
in beijing scrambled from their beds but there were no reports of 
damage in the capital state seismological bureau director fang 
zhangshun said the quakes were the strongest to hit northern china 
since a calamitous 1976 quake that measured at least 78 on the 
richter scale and killed 240000 people in northeastern tangshan 
earthquakes are frequent in china with more than 30 this year 
above 50 a magnitude capable of causing damage in populated 
areas five earthquakes measuring up to 67 on the richter scale 
hit western sichuan in june and july killing 11 people 
the richter scale is a measure of ground movement as recorded by 
seismographs the openended scale is logarithmic meaning that 
each degree of intensity is 10 times stronger than the last thus 
the 69 magnitude quake that hit san francisco is 10 times stronger 
than one registering 59 on the scale

three convicted murderers were 
hanged today but another received a stay of execution after 
claiming he was part of a police death squad that killed a 
prominent black antiapartheid activist 
butana nofemela was to be hanged at dawn at pretoria central 
prison along with two other blacks and a mixedrace man but 
justice minister kobie coetsee after receiving an urgent request 
from human rights lawyers granted a stay of execution pending an 
investigation of nofemelas claims 
according to lawyers nofemela said in an affadavit he was one 
of four security policemen who killed activist griffiths mxenge in 
1981 under orders from senior officers nofemela also said he was 
partly responsible for the killings of eight other political 
activists ordered by his superiors 
nofemela 32 was convicted in 1987 of murdering a white farmer 
in a case apparently without political overtones 
peter mothle a director of the pretoriabased organization 
lawyers for human rights said lawyers who studied nofemelas 
affidavit found it credible containing accurate details related to 
mxenges killings 
mxenges body was found outside a durbanarea stadium in 
november 1981 he had been stabbed more than 40 times 
mxenges wife victoria an attorney and activist was killed in 
august 1985 they are among several dozen antiapartheid activists 
black and white who have been killed in recent years in cases 
that have never been solved 
many activists believe most or all of the killings were carried 
out by elements of the security forces 
after the assassination in may of david webster a white 
activist and university lecturer police formed a special 
investigative force to probe both that killing and unsolved 
bombings of offices of antiapartheid groups no arrests have been 
made 
mothle said nofemelas claims initially would be investigated by 
the office of the transvaal province attorney general 
we hope they wont turn it over to the police but we have no 
control over that he said 
the three hangings friday raised to 45 the number of executions 
so far this year one of the prisoners was a mixedrace man 
convicted of killing two residents of an retirement home 
the other two were blacks convicted of murder during a 1986 
robbery 
two of the men hanged this year were white the rest black or of 
mixedrace the number of hangings so far this year is much lower 
than in recent years such as 1987 when a record 164 people were 
hanged 
the government says 60 condemned prisoners have received 
reprieves this year more than 200 prisoners nearly all of them 
black men remain on death row 
antiapartheid leaders in south africa including senior members 
of the african national congress guerrilla movement freed last 
sunday have listed an end to executions as one of their conditions 
for agreeing to enter negotiations with the whiteled government

the rev jesse jackson says south africa 
is trying to rig preindependence elections in the territory 
through a reign of terror 
the former presidential candidate made his remarks thursday in 
an appearance before the general assemblys fourth committee which 
handles independence questions 
meanwhile black african nations called for an urgent security 
council meeting to condemn south africas administration in the 
territory un officials said debate would probably begin early 
next week 
jackson said south africa was trying to rig the nov 711 
elections to hurt the leading black nationalist party the 
southwest africa peoples organization known as swapo 
jackson accused south africa of promoting a reign of terror 
taking part in namibia today by keeping former namibian commandos 
and paramilitary police on the payroll but letting them act as 
armed vigilantes for antiswapo parties 
he also criticized the united nations for not sending enough 
peacekeepers to namibia to prevent what he called a climate of 
intimidation so as to make a free and fair election impossible 
the security council decided early this year to send only 4650 
military observers rather than 7500 as a costcutting move 
namibians are to vote for a constituent assembly to organize the 
first independent black majorityruled government in the territory 
of 13 million the former german colony has been ruled by south 
africa since 1915 
in december south africa signed accords with angola and cuba 
agreeing to cooperate with a un plan for namibias transition to 
independence as cuba withdraws its 50000 troops from angola

pm thursday a halfhour after the gravely injured mother ana 
hernandez 27 had suffered cardiac arrest and stopped breathing a 
hospital spokesman said hernandez who was in a twocar collision 
had been due to deliver the baby in about a week 
you have to realize when the mothers system shuts down the 
baby stops getting oxygen said the spokesman michael fortier 
obviously theres a lot of amazement probably wonder and a lot 
of happiness that he survived 
dr ernest hanowell who helped deliver the child called it 
unusual that the baby survived in light of his mothers injuries 
doctors were unable to restore hernandezs breathing or make her 
heart beat on its own and she was pronounced dead about 45 minutes 
after the birth 
the baby boy weighing about seven pounds suffered oxygen 
deprivation and was hospitalized in serious condition thursday 
night officials said 
its extraordinary but its something we think about in 
emergency medicine all the time dr hugh hill another trauma 
surgeon said of the emergency caesarean section its something 
we anticipate and we worry about it its one of those heroic 
interventions we fear yet hope will be successful 
hill said surgeons did not have to choose between saving the 
mother or the baby hernandez technically was not dead when she was 
wheeled into the emergency room hanowell said but she had 
suffered massive internal injuries and if no one was breathing 
for her and pumping on her chest she certainly would have been 
dead 
hernandez had no other children her husband was with her at the 
hospital officials said

pravda told its readers today that a confidant of 
mikhail s gorbachev is replacing its conservative editor who had 
resisted letting the communist party daily fully embrace the new 
openness sweeping the soviet press 
in a frontpage report pravda said viktor g afanasyev had 
resigned and been replaced by ivan t frolov an advisor to 
gorbachev for the last year and a former editor of the partys 
theoretical monthly journal kommunist 
the move appears to assure that the voice of the communist party 
will now reflect more clearly the views of gorbachev and his 
reformminded allies 
pravda is the countrys most authoritative newspaper but its 
circulation has lagged under gorbachev as readers turn to livelier 
more informative newspapers its editor sits in on closed meetings 
of the ruling politburo 
the removal of afanasyev a 66yearold throwback to the rule of 
leonid i brezhnev marks a further attempt by the soviet president 
to clean house of conservatives last month three were retired 
from the politburo 
the change at pravdas helm also capped a turbulent week in the 
soviet press that first saw gorbachev rebuke trailblazing editors 
as taking glasnost too far threatening to sack them 
some soviet observers interpreted his criticism one week ago of 
the editors who are the most outspoken practitioners of glasnost as 
a way of softening the blow of afanasyevs removal for party 
conservatives 
they interpreted gorbachevs tactics as taking the middle course 
at a time of rising tension over the poor state of the economy and 
ethnic unrest 
the departure of afanasyev was announced by the official news 
agency tass on thursday and also reported on staterun television 
in its nightly news report pravda said the politburo had on 
thursday accepted afanasyevs request that he be transfered to 
scientific work 
frolov 60 is credited with formulating gorbachevs foreign 
policy that places priority on fostering values common to all 
mankind rather than encouraging class struggle 
afanasyev took over the party newspaper in 1976 during what is 
now condemned as a period of stagnation when pravda was accused of 
masking more often than disclosing the truth 
under his tutelage the papers circulation fell as it lagged 
behind other papers that more frankly cover national and 
international affairs 
many soviets turn now to publications such as arguments and 
facts and ogonyok which are filled with breezily written 
criticisms of the system 
arguments and facts a weekly has a circulation of 26 million 
more than double last years figure and is the countrys most 
popular newspaper 
at an oct 13 special party meeting with newspaper editors 
gorbachev assailed some as sowing discord by being overly critical 
of the leadership 
he reportedly called specifically for the resignation of the 
editor of arguments and facts vladislav a starkov apparently 
for publishing a reader survey that gave members of a minority 
opposition faction of the legislature the highest ratings 
questioning gorbachevs popularity 
but soviet lawmakers the weekly newspapers workers and an 
international organization the committee to protect journalists 
have rallied to defend the starkov on thursday members of 
starkovs staff said they had formed a work committee and elected 
him head in a bid to protect him from being fired 
pravda last month suffered an embarrassment when it reprinted an 
italian newspapers article claiming popular communist maverick 
boris n yeltsin boozed and shopped his way through the united 
states during a recent speaking tour 
a few days later pravda apologized saying the story could not 
be substantiated 
like afanasyev frolov is a full member of the communist partys 
governing central committee and its ideological commission and a 
member of the academy of sciences philosophy and law department 
afanasyev aide vasily p popov said his boss would be going to 
the academy to which he has for some time to wanted devote his 
attention more fully

new york democratic mayoral candidate david dinkins says hes 
not sure why he valued a cable tv companys stock at 1 million but 
sold it to his son for a fraction of the sum according to a 
published report today 
dinkins told the new york times in an interview thursday that 
when he learned that his stock in inner city broadcasting was worth 
1 million or more he could not believe it 
he said he learned of the estimate by company officials from his 
secretary 
the day the secretary says this is true i thought it was 
almost like a big joke dinkins recalled i said like im a 
millionaire 
he said that to avoid a conflict of interest when he became 
manhattan borough president he sold the shares to his son david 
jr in 1986 for 58000 a price he said he randomly picked 
without consulting tax lawyers or accountants 
the democratic frontrunner provided no explanation for the 
different values placed on the stock saying it didnt seem to 
matter much at the time 
asked what could have caused the discrepancy he said i 
really dont know 
the true worth of inner citys stock difficult to assess 
because the company is privately held rather than publicly traded 
is important because dinkins might owe gift taxes on its sale say 
tax experts and campaign aides for dinkins opponent rudolph 
giuliani 
new york newsday on thursday quoted the general counsel of inner 
city as saying the stock in 1984 was conservatively worth 4292 
per share or 25 million for dinkins 588 shares 
but dinkins said the companys general counsel john edmonds 
might have inflated the price of inner city stock to obtain a loan 
newsday said today 
edmonds told newsday on thursday he had not inflated the value 
of the stock but could offer no explanation for the different 
prices i made that statement on my judgment based on what the 
value was in my judgment hes right and im right edmonds said 
the daily news reported thursday that dinkins former secretary 
raquel vidal said her boss had set the stocks value at 13 
million or something like that when he submitted a sworn 
confidential report to gov mario cuomo 
the report was submitted when dinkins was a candidate for 
director of the state urban development corporation 
based on the publicly available information it appears to me 
that david dinkins owes between 285120 and 848291 to the 
federal government and as much as 195626 more to the state 
said giulianis campaign manager peter powers according to 
todays new york post and daily news powers said he was a tax 
lawyer 
dinkins said he was reviewing his tax forms and any liability he 
might have 
he accused giuliani of gutter politics after the latters 
week of unrelenting criticism on dinkins handling of the stock 
sale he threatened to respond with negative attacks of his own

chinas tough austerity policies have cooled off 
the overheated economy but have made few inroads in solving basic 
flaws in the system the government said today 
in a report on economic performance through september zhang 
zhongji spokesman for the state statistical bureau said the 
yearold austerity program had held the gross national product to 
30 billion up only 5 percent from the same period in 1988 
national industrial output for september reached 29 billion up 
only 09 percent from the same month last year 
zhang said consumer demand was down the rise in retail prices 
had been brought under control and the whole economy is taking a 
favorable turn 
but he acknowledged that no major breakthroughs had been 
achieved in resolving chronic supplydemand imbalances he said 
there was serious overstocking of some products because of market 
slumps and poor circulation of money because many companies are 
delaying payment of debts 
zhang also criticized the behavior of some enterprise managers 
and factory directors who still have doubts about the current 
policy so they dont exert all their efforts to promote 
production 
since last fall the government has sharply reduced credit 
available for investment ordered the suspension of thousands of 
building projects and tightened central controls over distribution 
and pricing in an attempt to curb industrial growth that exceeded 
20 percent last year and reduce an inflation rate of more than 30 
percent 
following the military crackdown of prodemocracy dissent in the 
spring the conservatives now in power have also demanded that 
large stateowned industries be given priority in receiving 
financing and supplies 
authorities have moved to restrict the growth of small 
collective and private enterprises that have thrived during the 
past decade of economic reform 
zhang said the output value of collective enterprises grew 125 
percent over the first three quarters to 87 billion compared to a 
growth rate of only 52 percent for stateowned industries which 
had an output value of 162 billion 
but he said the growth rate of collective and township 
enterprises was slowing dramatically 
he said 19 to 20 percent of stateowned enterprises continue to 
operate in the red he cited the deterioration of economic 
efficiency and the serious overstocking of some products 
retail sales were up only 123 percent to 164 billion far 
lower than growth rates of more than 30 percent during a period of 
panic buying last fall 
institutional buying was up only 62 percent to 14 billion 
the statistical bureau said that in the first eight months of 
this year 20 billion worth of goods were piled up in warehouses 
compared to 75 billion at the same time last year 
zhang said the average retail price increase so far in 1989 was 
about 22 percent and continued to fall in septmber prices were up 
only 13 percent from the same month last year 
he said though that it will be extremely difficult to meet 
the government target of bringing inflation down to 10 percent by 
years end

production fell in seven key sectors 
including food and steel during the third quarter of 1989 while 
prices and wages grew in an inflationary spiral according to 
another gloomy government report published today 
the steel chemical paper engineering transport food and 
fodder industries produced less in the first nine months of the 
year than during the same period of 1988 according to the main 
statistical office known by its polish initials gus 
at the same time there was a 30 percent increase in production 
from polands private sector newly liberated from many government 
regulations but because the private sector accounts for only about 
6 percent of the economy the report said the growth there could 
not balance the production decreases in government industries 
there were better results from the governments power mineral 
timber electroengineering electronical textile clothing and 
printing industries the report said 
several factors have been blamed for the production drop 
outmoded factories lack of production materials factories not 
paying suppliers for lack of payment from customers and the flight 
of workers to the private sector blackmarket activities or to 
work abroad where they can earn more 
also former deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula told a 
government committee this week that the former government erred in 
its decision to freeze prices which caused enterprises and private 
farmers to cut back production 
the government report is the key quarterly analysis of the 
polish economy but it follows numerous other commentaries from the 
new solidarityled government and from poles themselves on the dire 
state of finances 
the government faces a budget deficit of about 23 billion and 
it could reach 44 billion by the end of the year without radical 
costcutting steps 
an oversupply of money has cleared store shelves of goods and 
further driven up prices the price of butter for example is up 
more than 1000 percent since august 
government controls had kept food prices artificially low the 
controls were lifted aug 1 as part of the transformation designed 
to create a marketoriented economy 
the economic report said food prices are now 300 percent to 400 
percent higher than at the start of the year while prices of other 
goods were 200 percent to 300 percent higher 
a monthly report for august put overall price increases at 50 
percent for that month which would translate into an annual rate 
of 600 percent 
employment continued to decline in the five main branches of the 
governmentrun economy with the jobless rate rising from 26 
percent in january to 54 percent in september 
workers have been reported to be abandoning their jobs in the 
state industries for higher salaries in the private sector 
pay rates rose substantially in the five main branches of the 
economy from a monthly 42 in the first quarter to 99 in the 
third quarter by midoctober the average overall salary was 114 
a month

atlantis five astronauts plunged 
into a heavy schedule of medical scientific and photographic 
experiments today after being awakened by three rousing college 
fight songs 
weve got a full day planned for you mission control told 
the astronauts and even before they had breakfast they were asked 
to take pictures of gibralter in the mediterranean for a film being 
made about earths environment 
the wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three 
mission specialists on board boomer sooners uconn huskies 
and victory march 
shannon lucid attended the university of oklahoma franklin 
changdiaz the university of connecticut and ellen baker the state 
university of new york at buffalo 
the flight plan today called for the crew to continue 
experiments that measure earths damaged ozone layer and study the 
effects of weightlessness on the human body the processing of 
polymers and the growth of corn and ice crystals 
the nuclearpowered galileo probe the astronauts deployed about 
six hours after blastoff wednesday was zipping across the solar 
system at 9000 mph in great shape officials reported 
the 15 billion probes course for its sixyear 
24billionmile trip to jupiter involved more than 400000 miles 
of travel by midday today once it reaches jupiter galileo is 
expected to give the best look yet of another planet and find clues 
to the universes origin 
galileo was pronounced in perfect shape and right on 
course thursday by nasa and atlantis also was given a clean bill 
of health after the crew members restored a cooling system that 
shut down the previous day when it overheated cutting in a backup 
unit 
atlantis is scheduled to land at 238 pm edt monday at edwards 
air force base calif 
the other shuttle crew members are commander don williams and 
pilot mike mcculley 
on thursday mrs baker and changdiaz demonstrated a retinal 
photography experiment that could be seen on nasa satellite 
television 
with swimming goggles strapped around her head mrs baker 
steadied herself on the shuttles middeck while changdiaz pressed 
a camera to the right goggle to photograph her retina 
were trying to hold ourselves steady which is probably the 
hardest part of this task said mrs baker a medical doctor 
researchers want to study the 35mm camera slides to determine if 
there are any changes in the eyes vessels in zero gravity such 
changes could indicate some brain swelling and researchers want to 
find out if that is related to motion sickness in space 
also thursday night a camera in the cargo bay showed 
spectacular views of typhoon elsie in the philippines 
its a real big storm williams said 
weather permitting the astronauts hope to capture images of los 
angeles north and south korea the grand canyon the dallasfort 
worth area tokyo and several japanese volcanoes 
they are using a special imax camera that produces detailed film 
that can be shown on extralarge screens the film collected today 
will be used in two movies 
the astronauts will try to photograph lightning systems 
providing data that researchers say could help develop better 
weatherpredicting methods 
a new experiment aboard the shuttle uses a sensitive instrument 
in the cargo bay to measure the ozone layer which protects the 
earth from the suns harmful ultraviolet radiation 
the measurements taken aboard atlantis will be compared with 
data being collected at the same time and over the same areas by 
nearly identical sensors aboard three older us satellites the 
new data will be used ot help calibrate the satellite sensors 
many people fear depletion of the ozone layer will cause a rise 
in health problems such as skin cancer nasa has scheduled the same 
experiment for six more shuttle flights

government troops of killing 34 civilians in the southern town of 
wau in late july apparently to avenge the death of a soldier whose

the sudan government has not commented on the alleged massacre 
but the civilian government before its ouster in a coup june 30

killings do not appear to be isolated cases a statement said 
its information reveals a persistent pattern of serious human 
rights violations in the context of the civil war in the south 
it said many civilians and captured members of the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army had been killed by the army and 
governmentallied troops 
amnesty international urged the sudanese government to 
investigate the alleged massacre it also issued appeals on behalf

the new military government and subjected to a mock execution 
the government last week denied a report that elmahdi was being 
tortured a statement said his family has regular visits and that 
anybody else could visit him for evidence he had not been tortured

planned parenthood federation of america has 
announced the creation of a political arm that will lobby 
legislators against abortion restrictions 
citing the recent supreme court ruling giving states more 
authority to regulate abortion issues organization president faye 
wattleton announced the formation of the planned parenthood action 
fund at a news conference thursday opening the groups 66th annual 
meeting 
the webster decision put womens access to abortion in grave 
danger wattleton said webster left us with no other choice 
but to become even more politically aggressive than we had been 
before to ensure that the right to choose abortion remains secure 
the action funds firstyear budget of 1 million which must be 
raised separately from planned parenthoods regular funds will 
allow the national organization to expand its current lobbying and 
political campaign activities nationwide wattleton said 
final tax status approval from the internal revenue service is 
expected in three to four months she said 
the change will not affect the existing organization which will 
retain its taxexempt status that limits its spending to 250000 
on grassroots campaigns in individual states and 1 million 
nationally 
contributions to the new fund will not be tax deductible but 
donations to the parent organization still will be 
the funds initial effort will be a newspaper advertising and 
directmail campaign targeting the voting records of at least a 
dozen congressmen planned parenthood feels are a threat to abortion 
rights wattleton said 
more than 1200 delegates are attending the annual convention

brown university acting in the wake of 
attacks by blacks on white and asian students has canceled two 
social events for tonight that would have been attended mainly by 
black students 
the school canceled funk night and a dance sponsored by omega 
psi phi a black fraternity said robert reichley vice president 
for university relations 
he would not explain why officials canceled those events and not 
others during the annual parents weekend at the ivy league school 
our intention is not to make every move public he said 
thursday 
reichley said the university wants to make sure campus social 
events are retricted to students so they are easier to supervise 
there have been 19 reports of assaults or robberies on 22 
students since classes began in september at least 14 incidents 
were assaults on white and asian male students who described their 
attackers as black teenagers who did not appear to be students 
reichley said 
campus and providence police have increased security efforts and 
brown president vartan gregorian in a statement this week said he 
might ask for unspecified federal help he said some of the attacks 
appeared to be racially motivated 
troy priest a senior who is president of the brown chapter of 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
said he wanted to study the cancellation of the social events 
before commenting 
the way it has been applied may not be fair priest said 
but i want to talk to the university officials first 
reichley said the attacks had heightened tension on the campus 
where racial and antihomosexual graffiti was written on the walls 
of a dormitory last spring a march against violence is planned on 
the campus sunday night

a federal report says four united airlines jets 
flew through a dangerous wind shear at stapleton international 
airport last year when pilots either did not hear or misunderstood 
a control tower warning 
the report released thursday by the general accounting office 
said one jet canceled its approach but four others went through 
and eventually landed safely 
four commercial airline pilots from one airline flew into 
microburst activity despite prior warning by the controllers and 
explicit airline policy to avoid microburst alert areas the 
report said the crews either did not hear clearly or did not 
know the meaning of the term microburst alert 
a microburst is produced when a downdraft of heavy air hits the 
earth and causes winds to spread horizontally along the ground a 
plane going through one experiences a head wind then a downdraft 
and finally a tailwind which can cause a crash 
the stapleton microburst pushed winds in opposite directions at 
92 miles an hour officials said 
they were lucky said james evans a researcher with the 
massachusetts institute of technology who has helped conduct tests 
on the radar detecting the wind shifts 
none of the four pilots who landed during the incident could 
remember getting the alert said bob ireland who was staff 
engineer with uniteds flight training center in denver at the time 
they flat didnt remember it it was no wonder they didnt 
hear it thats a very very busy time for pilots he said 
the gao recommended in its report that controllers be required 
to reroute air traffic when microbursts are detected even if 
pilots think its safe

this is not possible said foreign minister krzystof

four jehovahs witness missionaries who 
disappeared while preaching doortodoor in mexico five years ago 
apparently were slain by drug smugglers who mistook them for us 
agents a published report says 
the justice department linked the slayings of the two married 
couples to the drug cartel implicated in the torturekilling of 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena the los 
angeles times reported today 
dennis carlson 32 and his wife rose 36 of redding calif 
and benjamin mascarenas 29 and his wife pat 27 of ely nev 
are thought to have been killed in guadalajara mexico on dec 2 
1984 the newspaper reported 
the couples were believed to be following the religions 
wellknown practice of preaching doortodoor working in an 
upperclass guadalajara neighborhood before they disappeared the 
newspaper said 
they apparently went to the wrong house the newspaper 
quoted a source as saying they were suspected of being dea 
agents 
federal investigators believed the couples were buried in the 
same guadalajara park where camarena initially was buried the 
report said camarena disappeared in february 1985 his body and 
that of his pilot were found a month later buried on a ranch 
outside guadalajara 
the bodies of the missionaries have not been found 
federal authorities have indicted several members of an alleged 
drug cartel in the camarena slaying including reputed kingpin 
rafael caro quintero who is in custody in a mexican prison 
last week caro and 11 others also were indicted in los angeles 
in connection with the slayings of two us citizens one month 
before the camarena killing authorities believe they like the 
missionaries were killed in a case of mistaken identity because 
drug lords thought they were dea agents 
the times quoted sources as saying that charges may never be 
brought against the suspects in the missionary slayings because the 
evidence is largely circumstantial

halfdozen diners 
the allpotato menu was prepared for the benefit of a japanese 
television crew that is touring the united states filming a 
halfhour history of the potato chip which was supposed to have 
been invented in saratoga springs ny in 1853

versatility jeanlouis was asked to prepare a dream lunch 
featuring nothing but potato dishes he happily obliged i was 
raised all my life with potatoes he said 
jeanlouis began with tiny potato pancakes containing smoked 
salmon and topped with caviar followed by a cream soup of purple 
chilean potatoes with idaho potato dumplings and purple potato 
chips next came icelandic langoustines wrapped in fried shredded

janice freiburger kept thinking she wasnt 
ready to die as she struggled to escape a car wedged in a gap 
between the collapsed upper deck of the bay bridge and the split 
lower deck 
as she fumbled with her seat belt and climbed across the 
drivers seat freiburger hoped her movements would not tip the 
crushed car into san francisco bay 
freiburger helped to safety suffered a cracked breastbone 
cracked spine and cracked collarbone in the wreck the impact of 
the accident left her a quarterinch shorter doctors said 
from her hospital bed thursday she said she felt very sore 
but very lucky happy to be here 
she and bruce stephan the driver of the gray 1984 mazda 
marveled that they were the only ones on that section of bridge as 
it collapsed in tuesdays rushhour earthquake a small red car 
seen flying over the edge in a home video tape shown on national 
television this week arrived minutes later after most traffic had 
managed to stop the driver was killed 
stephans car crumpled like tin and he cant explain why it 
didnt plunge into the bay 
the ground just opened up and the car started going down he 
said all i could think is im going through the bridge and into 
the bay i knew it was death i didnt think there was 
anything that could stop us 
at his apartment in san francisco stephan said he was searching 
for reasons why he survived the unthinkable with no more than a 
sore neck maybe he said he will get a chance to save someone 
else 
it seems like it should be more profound it was kind of a 
brush with death but i dont feel that much different said the 
33yearold 
he and freiburger 41 of larkspur work at a san francisco real 
estate company they were returning from a project in the east bay 
when they were caught on the bridge 
ill live with the aches and pains of bruises and just be 
thankful im here said freiburger who may be released early 
next week 
it all happened in just split seconds she recalled first 
there was a moment of utter silence and then boom an 
explosiontype of noise it all opened up we went traveling down 
like a roller coaster ride just that fast 
stephan thought at first that he had four flat tires when the 
bridge began bouncing and weaving he knew it was an earthquake 
i closed my eyes real tight and made my mind blank he said 
you know how youre supposed to have all those flashbacks and 
your whole life flashes before your eyes that didnt happen i 
told janice were going to die and she said no were not 
hold on 
when the car slammed to a stop stephan climbed out the window 
and onto the hood of the car propelled by fear he reached 
overhead and hoisted himself up onto the surface of the bridges 
lower deck 
despite her injuries freiburger was able to scramble out of the 
car and onto the hood stephan and a stranger pulled her to safety 
she immediately started walking toward treasure island 
everyone said this is amazing recalled stephan 
describing the rushhour crowd of drivers on the lower deck of the 
bridge but since we werent bleeding everyone pretty much 
wanted to get off the bridge themselves 
it was more than a mile to treasure island and freiburger was 
having trouble breathing but the pair kept walking 
i was in a great deal of pain and i just knew that i was going 
to make it freiburger said 
after preliminary treatment at a clinic the two were taken by 
ambulance to san francisco general hospital 
neither stephan nor freiburger is eager to cross the bridge when 
it reopens 
when the ground drops out from underneath you its kind of 
hard to trust anything he said 
vowing to try it eventually freiburger conceded the return trip 
may be a long way off 
im certain i will never cross any bridge without some 
anxiety she said but its something i will have to work with 
when you live in the bay area there are a lot of bridges

colombias judges and other court 
workers returned to work today after failing in a threeday strike 
to force the government to protect them from drug traffickers 
we are certain that more of us will be murdered in coming 
months but we cant shut down the court system for very long 
said consuelo herrera a federal judge and member of the court 
workers union the association of judicial employees 
the 5000 judges and 12000 other judicial workers walked off 
the job tuesday after a federal judge was slain by drug dealers in 
retaliation for the extradition of drug suspects to the united 
states 
since 1981 about 50 judges and 170 other judicial employees 
have been killed in colombia the association of judicial employees 
says 1600 of the 5000 judges have been threatened with death in 
the last 12 months 
ms herrera said union workers are prepared to strike again the 
next time a judge or court worker is murdered by drug traffickers 
the next strike will be longer and the next one longer 
still she said we will continue to call strikes as long as we 
are being killed and the government continues to do nothing 
ms herrera said justice minister roberto salazar manrique told 
union members in a meeting tuesday that the government lacks the 
resources to increase protection for judges 
she said none of the 19 million in aid promised by the bush 
administration to protect colombian judges has arrived in the 
country 
meanwhile the bogota daily el tiempo published an account of 
yet another attempt by the medellin cocaine cartel to begin talks 
with officials on ending the government crackdown on the drug trade 
an unidentified medellin lawyer representing the cartel spoke 
two weeks ago with the countrys leading leftist bernardo 
jaramillo a candidate in march presidential elections el tiempo 
quoted jaramillo as saying 
jaramillo was quoted as telling the lawyer that he favors 
dialogue with the traffickers but not while the traffickers are 
setting off bombs and killing people 
the medellin cartel has made several contacts with government 
officials and other politicians in attempts to negotiate a truce in 
the 2monthold war on drugs 
president virgilio barco has said there will be no talks and no 
truce 
barco resumed extraditions to the united states on aug 18 
following the slayings of a leading presidential candidate a 
federal judge and a police colonel by drug barons 
but the traffickers have struck back with a terror campaign that 
has included more than 160 bombings and the assassinations of eight 
news industry workers 
the government on thursday pressed ahead in its antidrug 
offensive by arresting two drug suspects one the alleged personal 
pilot of the presumed head of the medellin cocaine cartel pablo 
escobar 
the pilot jorge de la cuesta marquez is wanted on federal 
charges in florida national police col oscar pelaez carmona said 
in a news release 
de la cuesta arrested in a raid on a north bogota apartment is 
wanted on a us indictment for conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
and will be held for extradition pelaez carmona said 
with de la cuestas arrest five colombians await extradition to

with israel were stabbed to death today by fellow arabs and one 
body was wheeled around the streets of a west bank city as a 
warning to others arab reports said 
government officials said secretary of state james a baker iii 
telephoned prime minister yitzhak shamir thursday to try to get the 
stalled middle east peace process restarted 
on tuesday shamir publicly criticized us proposals that he 
fears are aimed at pressuring israel to talk with the plo 
the englishlanguage jerusalem post reported the united states 
has offered to sign a memorandum of understanding to rule out 
any plo involvement in preliminary peace talks israeli officials 
declined comment 
arab reporters said 24yearold taher abu saleh was stabbed to 
death in nablus shortly after dawn they said masked palestinians 
pushed the corpse in a cart through nablus central market before 
dumping it on the street 
the death was blamed on the red eagles one of two arab gangs 
reportedly active in nablus against suspected collaborators 
the second killing occurred in the gaza strips breij refugee 
camp arab reporters said harb odeh essa 43 was attacked in his 
home by masked palestinians he was suspected of having ties with 
israeli authorities they said 
essa was dead on arrival at shifa hospital in gaza city and 
doctors said his throat was cut 
the army confirmed the nablus killing and said it was checking 
the gaza case 
the deaths raised to 132 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the 22month uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 596 palestinians and 
40 israelis have been slain 
bakers call to shamir followed three other recent contacts 
shamirs call to president bush on tuesday a phone conversation 
wednesday between israeli foreign minister moshe arens and baker 
and a letter thursday from shamir to baker 
all appeared aimed at easing tension created by shamir tuesday 
when he warned members of his rightwing likud bloc of a tense 
period with the united states 
he later told a political rally that the stonethrowers the 
firebombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms of the 
plo it is not possible that when they fail to do this others by 
diplomatic means would try to bring us to meetings with the 
plo 
the comments were seen as slaps at baker who has put forward a 
proposal designed to get israel to accept an invitation from egypt 
for preliminary talks with palestinians 
today shamir aide avi pazner told the associated press that in 
the latest phone conversation baker and shamir discussed how to 
move ahead on israels peace plan which calls for elections in the 
occupied lands as a first step toward limited autonomy 
the jerusalem post report said the bush administration has 
offered to prepare a memorandum of understanding that would 
cover shamirs main objections to bakers plan the memorandum the 
post said would rule out involvement by the palestine liberation 
organization and restrict preliminary talks to israels proposed 
elections in the territories 
it quoted unnamed government sources as saying shamir was not 
inclined to accept the administrations offer in its present form 
shamir is to visit washington in midnovember to discuss the 
peace process

an east german opposition figure said people have 
been too quick to condemn the countrys new leader and he urged 
citizens to give the reputed hardliner a chance to institute 
reforms a newspaper said today 
on his first full day as head of the country egon krenz on 
thursday chatted with factory workers in east berlin and portrayed 
himself as open to dialogue and change 
krenz also met with a church leader and opened the way for a new 
law regulating foreign travel 
the image of the active leader engaged in frank discussion with 
workers contrasted sharply with the stiff reclusive manner of 
erich honecker who was removed wednesday after 18 years in power 
opposition groups say the new communist party chiefs politics 
differ little from those of his autocratic predecessor 
more than 10000 people demanding change rallied in the city of 
zittau in southeastern east germany on thursday night said 
activists from the new forum prodemocracy group 
but rolf henrich a new forum member was quoted today as saying 
krenz should be given time to change peoples minds 
it doesnt make sense to deny him a chance from the very 
start henrich was quoted as saying in the west german newspaper 
badische zeitung 
he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was also once a 
supporter of the party apparatus 
and look how excited we all are about whats he doing now 
henrich said 
krenz 52 faces the most serious threat to orthodox communist 
rule in east germanys 40year history as tens of thousands flee 
to the west and thousands of others who do not wish to leave 
agitate for a more open society 
he already has said the party will resist the democratic reforms 
under way in poland and hungary 
nonetheless west germanys ard television network said his 
meeting with factory workers would have been unthinkable only a 
few weeks ago 
the broadly publicized meetings appeared aimed at showing the 
countrys 165 million people that krenz will deliver on his pledge 
to address east germanys problems as long as the partys leading 
role remains intact 
when asked by krenz why so many coworkers fled to west germany 
metal worker ronald berus said a lot of things kept adding up 
until some people felt there was no alternative 
until last week you couldnt talk about problems and people 
just got fed up he said 
several workers complained of rigid travel restrictions to the 
west which were recently expanded to bar travel to czechoslovakia 
poland and hungary without government permission thousands of east 
germans have made their way to the west through those countries in 
recent weeks 
in one of his first official acts in office krenz said the 
government is drafting a new law that could ultimately ease travel 
abroad he said west germanys refusal to recognize east german 
citizenship is an obstacle bonn grants east germans automatic 
citizenship 
wolfgang lueder a member of west german chancellor helmut 
kohls ruling coalition today was quoted as saying bonn could help 
expand travel by allowing east germans to change money for west 
german marks east german currency is not convertible 
lueder was quoted in an interview with colognes express 
newspaper as saying the move would be a subsidized exchange he 
suggested bonn could use the new east german marks to buy more

protesters clashed with the bodyguards 
of west berlin mayor walter momper during a rally today outside the 
federal parliament building 
the antimilitary service group action for total refusal was 
protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft dodger to 
serve jail time in west germany 
federal officials are trying to extradite gerhard scherer from 
west berlin to begin serving a fivemonth sentence for refusing 
both mandatory military service and the alternative civilian 
service option for those opposed to violence 
west german residents of west berlin are not subject to the 
compulsory service law because of the citys status under allied 
control 
about 10 demonstrators protesting illegally on the parliament 
grounds startled mompers security detachment when they abruptly 
unfurled a banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the 
demonstrators tried to press on momper 
one of the protesters wore a rubber mask of chancellor helmut 
kohl on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well 
creating the impression he had his back to momper when he leaped 
forward to unfurl the banner 
startled security men wrestled the masked protester to the 
ground and others engaged in brief skirmishes with demonstrators 
to separate them from mompers party 
momper a member of the leftwing social democratic party had 
been asked by the antimilitary service group to reject the 
extradition request he was at the federal parliament building 
today to be inaugurated as president of the bundesrat the upper 
house of parliament 
demonstrations are forbidden on the west german parliament 
grounds but no arrests were made following the incident early 
friday 
scherer was a resident of badenwuerttemberg state when he 
reached the military service age he is in hiding in west berlin 
where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to 
badenwuerttemberg to serve his term

nine united mine workers members were 
arrested and charged in a series of bombings at a mine where a 
strike has been under way for five years 
the miners arrested thursday were accused in two bombings an 
attempted bombing and a fire that did 400000 damage at milburn 
colliery where 45 union members went on strike in october 1984 
authorities planned to seek indictments next week before a 
federal grand jury in charleston said us attorney michael carey 
one miner larry massey was charged with destroying property 
involved in interstate commerce carey said he faces 10 years in 
prison and 250000 in fines if convicted eight others were 
charged with conspiracy to use explosives and faces up to five 
years in prison and 250000 in fines 
all nine were arraigned before a federal magistrate in bluefield 
and freed on 10000 bond 
the umws chief spokesman joe corcoran said the union was 
unaware of any evidence implicating the nine 
in any strike situation there are many allegations and 
accusations that turn out not to be true he said 
in june not long after the mines owners hired a new company to 
operate the mine a bomb was set off at a bridge entrance and in 
july a fire resulted in about 400000 damage carey said 
then last month a bomb caused about 35000 damage to a mine 
ventilation system and authorities disarmed a 57pound time bomb 
before it exploded carey said 
no one was injured in the incidents 
carey said the investigation is continuing but would not

guildford four are now free after a long fight for exoneration 
the four were serving life sentences for two irish republican 
army bombings that killed five people in 1974 in guildford 
southwest of london a london judge overturned the convictions 
thursday ruling that police officers probably lied to get the four 
convictions 
the government immediately ordered an inquiry into alleged 
police misconduct 
while three of the four were freed thursday 35yearold hill 
was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a british 
soldier and he was flown to belfast to begin an appeal 
he was freed today on 6500 bail and emerged from the court to 
cheers from friends and relatives including his 14yearold 
daughter cara 
i am very happy he replied to a reporters question how 
do you think i feel after 14 years of hell 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for 
police said in a bbctv interview thursday night that the 
guildford case was a blow for the whole system of criminal 
justice in britain

the guildford four said thursday that three officers had been 
suspended from duty pending the inquiry by retired appeals judge 
sir john may

said a fourth officer involved a detective inspector had died and 
a fifth a detective chief inspector had retired

officials church leaders and journalists to overturn the verdict

in dangerous games the collective title of 
two dance theater pieces created by graciela daniele the theme is 
domination primarily sexual and political done to a tango beat 
in tango two sinister workingclass brothers violate and 
then fight over a young prostitute in orfeo a reworking of 
the orpheus legend the hero seeks to rescue his love from the 
argentine secret police who operate out of a place not unlike hades 
all of this which arrived at broadways nederlander theater on 
thursday is not as interesting as it might sound even though the 
evening contains some haunting tango music by astor piazzolla 
the dancing is a tad pretentious and a bit silly particularly 
when its trying to be sexy danieles choreography is filled with 
steamy clinches erotic posturing and a heavy dose of whips and 
leather its light years from the romantic duets that were the 
main attraction of a different kind of tango entertainment tango 
argentino a mild broadway success several seasons ago 
tango is the earthy simple and more successful of danieles 
two dances the two brothers gregory mitchell and john mineo are 
violent narcissistic men stereotypes of the macho latin 
tradition they fight strut and then take whatever they want 
particularly the new woman in the bordello tina paul 
paul is not only a fine dancer but shes an actress too making 
the womans brutalization all the more convincing in the end she 
is the most poignant victim transformed into someone as hard and 
as uncaring as the men who used her 
in orfeo daniele reaches for political significance and 
falls short the piece is dedicated to the desaparecidos the 
spanish word for all those who were arrested and then disappeared 
during the brutal argentine military dictatorship 
danieles orfeo gregory mitchell again is a gaucho who sees 
his love rene caballos spirited away by pluton ken ard who 
wears military fatigues and a beret ard is an athletic dancer who 
projects an unnerving menace but hes also saddled with some of 
william finns worst lyrics particularly when he sings about the 
joys of torture the lyrics seem to be an intrusion on the 
evening and could have been cut with little harm to both pieces 
the choreography cant support the weight of danieles political 
message at times it has a folksy agnes de mille quality 
peasants cavorting around the stage at other times it reaches for 
the mock solemnity of gerald arpino recalling the joffrey ballet 
clinker sacred grove on mount tamalpais but its never as 
moving as its subject matter 
tony straiges has designed a tawdry and forbidding bordello for 
tango and an allpurpose red wall meant to signify hell in 
orfeo patricia zipprodts costumes are surprisingly 
understated allblack outfits for the men and billowy dresses for 
the women 
daniele who has choreographed broadway musicals including the 
pirates of penzance the rink and the mystery of edwin 
drood needs more of a story line on which to hang her dances 
her choreography isnt compelling enough to compensate for the thin 
tales she and coauthor jim lewis have concocted for dangerous 
games 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times if theater people want to make a 
spectacle of themselves on a broadway stage that is their 
inalienable right but whatever happened to the poor audiences 
right to enjoy a few laughs in the face of such disaster 
howard kissel daily news while the choreography in both is 
virtuosic and danced with great vehemence and ardor danieles 
imagination seldom goes beyond the adolescent in her depiction of 
the earthiness and sensuality of the brothel or the repressiveness 
of the generals 
clive barnes new york post the sad thing is that the dancers 
do their level best to raise this grisly corpse of an evening into 
some semblance of life as if they were literally flogging a dead 
horse

the voice of laurence olivier thundered through 
westminster abbey today as 2000 guests including most of 
britains greatest actors paid homage to the late giant of stage 
and screen 
the recorded excerpt of oliviers speech to the troops in 
shakespeares henry v was the highlight of a service honoring 
olivier 
there may be imitators but there is no second olivier he was 
unique sir alec guinness said in the eulogy 
sir john gielgud 85 recited from john donnes holy sonnet 
delivering its opening line in a gravelly whisper death be not 
proud 
dame peggy ashcroft recited from john miltons lycidas and 
sir john mills and albert finney read passages from the bible 
lord olivier as he was known after his 1970 ennoblement died 
on july 11 at age 82 and was buried at a small family funeral in 
southern england his ashes will be laid finally to rest next year 
in westminster abbey 
although it marked a death the nationally televised service was 
alive with triumphal music swelling through the cavernous abbey 
and there were occasional chuckles as guinness remembered some of 
the lighter moments of oliviers life 
leading the congregation was oliviers widow the actress joan 
plowright also present was prince edward queen elizabeth iis 
youngest son and an aspiring actor deputy prime minister sir 
geoffrey howe represented the government 
other actors present included michael caine peter otoole 
derek jacobi and michael york and italian film director franco 
zeffirelli 
guinness 75 said olivier stands alongside the acknowledged 
great 
even allowing for violent changes of fashion i feel that each 
of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his 
style applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own 
great a muchabused word readily applied to olivier 
guinness said perhaps it consists of a happy combination of 
imagination physical magnetism a commanding and appealing voice 
an expressive eye and danger 
he singled out oliviers 1946 performance of king lear when 
he spoke with the utmost simplicity the speech which begins 
ill pray and then ill sleep 
he knelt centerstage facing the audience and made no 
movement he created an awful stillness 
guinness summed up olivier as ambitious determined brave and 
daring a full life lived generously and shared with all of us he 
has i am sure the nations gratitude 
he concluded with two famous lines from hamlet 
good night sweet prince 
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest

many hunters get hurt simply by falling out of 
trees not by being shot by other hunters federal health 
researchers said 
the centers for disease control which studies injuries as well 
as disease reported thursday the results of a georgia study 
showing that 36 percent of hunting injuries involved tree stands 
the perches where deer hunters wait for prey 
the cdc and georgia officials studied 594 deer huntingrelated 
injuries in the state over the 197989 hunting seasons 214 
involved tree stands which may be hastily built platforms or 
storebought tree chairs 
seventeen people died fractures were common and several 
teenage hunters suffered neck fractures and were paralyzed 
this is just the tip of the iceberg said dr steven gordon 
an epidemiologist with the georgia department of human resources 
the nature of the system is such that the only reports we get are 
the ones that are fairly serious 
he added were sure this is occurring in other states but no 
one had systematically looked into it 
when most people hear of hunting accidents they picture one 
person shooting another said joel brown georgias state 
huntersafety coordinator but in recent years he said more than 
50 percent have involved tree stands its a serious problem 
he said 
most of the tree stand injuries involved falls 111 hunters were 
hurt when they tumbled out of their stands 49 fell while trying to 
climb down and 40 fell while trying to climb up gordon said the 
average stand was 16 feet above the ground 
twentyseven injuries and eight of the 17 tree stand 
fatalities occurred when weapons went off accidentally either 
while firearms were being carried up and down the tree or on impact 
from a fall 
sixtyone of the 214 tree stand mishaps involved mechanical 
failure as the stand or its steps collapsed under the hunters 
weight 
eleven hunters reported they had fallen asleep just before 
falling out eight hunters either admitted they were drunk or were 
suspected of it by game officials 
that number gordon said might be low we could not assess 
the influence of alcohol or other substance abuse most of 
these hunters did not have bloodalcohol levels taken he said 
while some hunters simply lost their balance some suffered 
bizarre accidents 
a law enforcement officer chopped down small trees surrounding 
his stand to improve his view of the deer he fell from his stand 
onto the jagged tree stumps and was severely injured brown said 
another hunter brown said climbed a tree in a pond not 
knowing the tree had been killed by beavers the tree broke in two 
and the hunter was killed when he tumbled out and the tree fell on 
top of him 
gordon said a woman was hurt when she shot a deer from her tree 
perch and the wounded animal charged the impact from the deer 
crashing into the tree dislodged her and she broke a leg in the 
fall 
some of the injured hunters were asked whether they had taken a 
hunting safety course twothirds hadnt and none of the 214 
injured hunters was wearing a safety harnesses or seat belt 
many mishaps could have been prevented the cdc said if hunters 
had used safety harnesses unloaded their guns while climbing up 
and down used pullup cords to hoist their weapons into their 
stands and checked the condition of their stands before climbing in

parliament meeting to move hungary 
closer to democracy voted today to disband a militia that was 
created to protect the communist party after the 1956 revolt 
the legislature also approved proposals to rehabilitate victims 
of political trials during hungarys years of communist oppression 
the decision to disband the militia came just three days before 
the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 revolt which was crushed by 
soviet tanks 
the bill had been opposed by the socialist party which assumed 
power after the communist party was formally dismantled oct 7 
the socialist party which professes democratic ideals but 
remains in sole possession of power at least until parliamentary 
elections next year had suggested disarming the force but keeping 
it as a civil defense organization 
the existence of the workers militia is no longer 
justified declared justice ministry state secretary gyula borics 
in introducing legislation to dissolve the 60000strong force 
of votes cast on the issue 274 were in favor of termination 
with six against and 30 abstentions 
parliament already rehabilitated revolutionary leader imre nagy 
and his leading associates earlier in the year 
parliament had already rehabilitated revolutionary leader imre 
nagy and his leading associates earlier in the year but the bill 
passed today was broader extending to all those convicted of 
revolutionary activity during the a956 uprising 
the bill which also pledged unspecified compensation to 
victims was approved by 278 legislators with four against 26 
abstentions 
a similar but separate bill also formally rehabilitated those 
victimized between 1948 and 1962 the period now officially 
considered hungarys stalinist period 
parliament has been meeting in a historic session aimed at 
removing the vestiges of 41 years of communist rule on thursday 
parliament passed legislation permitting opposition parties to 
compete in the first free national elections since 1948 
lawmakers still must settle a dispute over when to select a new 
president 
a proposal agreed on by the socialist party and most major 
opposition parties suggested that voters cast ballots on nov 26 
with subsequent heads of state appointed by parliament 
but some opposition groups fear the ruling party would have too 
strong an advantage if the president were chosen next month 
they have collected nearly 200000 signatures calling for a 
referendum on whether the president should be chosen now or only 
after national elections redistribute political power parliament 
is to try and sort out the issue at its next session beginning

ministry of agriculture officials 
friday began slaughtering 5000 salmonellainfected chickens owned 
by a group of nuns who previously had locked themselves in their 
coop to protect their flock 
the 13 nuns offered no resistance when the officials arrived at 
the our lady of passion monastery 70 miles north of london to carry 
out a task they tried to start two weeks ago 
the ministry officials accompanied by a governmentappointed 
veterinarian were led into the hen house by grimfaced nuns 
the hens necks were wrung and the carcasses were put in 
cardboard boxes that were loaded onto trucks for deliver to a dump 
site 
during the slaughter about six animal rights protesters 
demonstrated outside the convent holding a banner that said 
5000 killed today 45 million killed every year dont support 
factory farming 
the nuns led by a kentuckyborn mother superior sister 
catherine had gone to court seeking to overturn the ministrys 
ruling that their eggs were a serious health risk but did not 
succeed 
two weeks ago they locked themselves in the henhouse for three 
hours to prevent the slaughter from being carried out 
the nuns were to receive some compensation from the government 
but it was likely to be only a fraction of the 95400 they say 
they need to finance a new venture making luxury chocolates

more than 120 vietnamese who made the 
treacherous boat journey to hong kong flew back home friday after 
their hopes for a new life were dashed in the teeming camps of this 
british colony 
another group of about 120 is expected to return home within 
days and 850 others are awaiting repatriation on later flights 
according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees 
a chartered boeing 737 carried 52 men 47 women 12 boys and 11 
girls to hanoi bringing the number of vietnamese repatriated under 
the unsponsored program to 385 in four flights since march 
waving their red boarding passes and shaking hands with refugee 
relief officials the vietnamese boarded the plane carrying plastic 
shopping bags filled with personal possessions some parents 
carried toddlers while other vietnamese carried huge boom box 
cassette players 
we believe that voluntary repatriation works said anne 
shepherd deputy chief of the un refugee office in hong kong 
the number of people applying has increased substantially 
she said that since the voluntary repatriation program started 
in mid1988 the number of vietnamese applying to go home has 
increased from about 30 a month to about 65 each week 
but the number of vietnamese volunteering to go home represents 
only a fraction of the nearly 44000 boat people in the colony who 
have not been granted refugee status and the hong kong government 
says other measures are needed 
hong kong officials maintain that boat people who are denied 
refugee status must be repatriated against their will if necessary 
but hanoi has yet to accept such a program 
washington also has expressed opposition to forcible 
repatriation 
the returning boat people are taken to their hometowns and 
monitored by the un refugee organization so far we have had 
no indication of any problems for the returning vietnamese ms 
shepherd said on the tarmac of hong kong international airport 
boat people returning to their impoverished communist homeland 
receive 50 for adults and 25 for children by the un 
organization 
the hong kong government earlier accepted all vietnamese boat 
people as refugees entitled to resettlement but under a tough 
policy adopted in june 1988 to stem the rising tide of 
asylumseekers the government ruled out resettlement for new 
arrivals unless they could prove they were fleeing political 
persecution 
the vast majority of the more than 44000 boat people to arrive 
under the new policy will fail to receive refugee status 
nearly 12700 vietnamese still in hong kong camps arrived before 
june 1988 and are eligible for resettlement

relatives who insist raoul wallenberg is still 
alive said friday the search for the swedish diplomat who vanished 
decades ago after saving thousands of jews will continue in a 
prison next week 
there is evidence that raoul had been at various periods 
between 1950 and 1980 in the prison of vladimir about 75 miles 
from moscow said guy von dardel wallenbergs halfbrother 
soviet authorities say wallenberg who is credited with saving 
tens of thousands of hungarian jews from the nazis during world war 
ii died in another prison in 1947 two years after he was arrested 
in budapest on spying charges 
the soviet line on wallenbergs death has not changed von 
dardel told a news conference but officials are cooperating with 
the relatives search and suggested a trip to the vladimir prison 
monday to let them check its archives and cells themselves 
von dardel and wallenbergs halfsister nina lagergren arrived 
in moscow on oct 14 for their officially approved trip in an 
initial meeting soviet authorities presented them with 
wallenbergs personal effects including his blue diplomatic 
passport which they said had just been found among sacks of such 
items at kgb headquarters 
they were also shown a copy of a death certificate that backs up 
the soviet claim that wallenberg died of heart failure in 1947 
but von dardel and lagergren maintain their belief that 
wallenberg who would be 77 is still alive 
von dardel said the vladimir prison used to have a special 
section for foreigners and about 20 former prisoners have told 
western investigators there was a swede whose name varied but 
resembled wallenberg 
he said he would travel to the prison and investigate its 
records which go back to 1953 and the cells themselves but that 
he did not expect to find wallenberg there because the foreigners 
section is gone 
lagergren said it was moving just to visit moscow and the kgbs 
lubyanka prison where wallenberg was held 
you can imagine what it feels like to pass through the 
lubyanka prison and think that raoul has been there beginning in 
1945 she said and that he was there for two years not far 
away from the swedish embassy without being able to contact 
anybody outside prison and we didnt know 
soviet authorities investigated the relatives list of people 
who believed they had seen wallenberg with remarkable quickness 
and resolved many points but not all von dardel said 
a soviet official who met with the wallenberg relatives said 
friday they would continue to be welcome to search for his traces 
but they could not expect to find him alive 
the soviet side has confirmed that the fact of wallenbergs 
death is irrevocable and nothing more can be done here foreign 
ministry official nikolai uspensky said

rep barney frank dmass said friday there 
is no basis whatsoever to a published report that he engaged in 
sexual misconduct in the house gym and predicted that any ethics 
committee investigation would support his denial 
the washington times reported friday that the ethics committee 
has evidence of sexual misconduct by frank and several other 
members in the gym located in the subbasement of the rayburn 
house office building 
the allegations in the washington times today that i engaged 
in improper activities in the house gym are completely untrue 
frank said in a statement issued by his office 
there is simply no basis whatsoever for any suggestions to the 
contrary and i am confident that the ethics committee will concur 
gym supervisor dennis fogle asked if he was aware of any 
misconduct in the gym said not to my knowledge he said the 
gym is for members only and there are no provisions he is aware of 
for members to bring guests there with them 
a source in the speakers office speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said no allegations of misconduct in the gym have been 
brought to the attention of the speaker of the house thomas s 
foley dwash 
one ethics committee source who also spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said the full panel has not held discussions on the 
subject during its investigation of frank 
the newspaper which said it could not ascertain the names of 
any of the other congressmen said it learned of the evidence from 
several members close to the ethics investigation these sources 
were not named 
the times quoted a male prostitute stephen gobie as saying he 
and frank had performed sex acts on a couple of occasions after 
hours in the house gym the newspaper said it had confirmed that 
frank had brought a number of young men to the gym which 
generally is offlimits to the public and to staff 
the paper said the ethics panel had determined that several 
congressmen had taken male and female guests into the gym for 
illicit sexual activity 
the ethics committee has been investigating franks conduct 
since gobie revealed his 19851987 relationship with the 
congressman to the times

the senate today approved impeachment charges 
against us district judge alcee l hastings of miami ousting him 
from the federal bench for conspiring to obtain a 150000 payoff 
hastings fate was sealed on the first of 17 articles of 
impeachment when the senate voted 6926 to convict him of 
conspiracy more than the twothirds margin required 
in two hours of backtoback roll calls the senate convicted 
hastings on eight articles acquitted him on three and waived votes 
on the other six counts 
hastings the first black federal district judge in florida was 
removed from the bench even though he had been acquitted in 1983 in 
a criminal trial 
maintaining his innocence after the vote he said he intends to 
run for governor of florida and resume the practice of law 
im upbeat and can go forward with my life he told 
reporters there are those of you who would say i should be 
banished in infamy i know nothing in my life that requires that 
the senate also voted to convict hastings on seven subsequent 
charges that included perjury the senate voted 4847 and 6035 in 
favor of two allegations but the tallies were short of the 
twothirds needed for conviction in the other acquittal it voted 
950 to clear hastings of a charge he improperly disclosed wiretap 
information 
the voting over sen robert byrd dwva announced from the 
presiding officers chair 
the senate having tried alcee l hastings united states 
district judge for the southern district of florida upon 17 of the 
articles of impeachment exhibited against him by the house of 
representatives and twothirds of the senate having found him 
guilty it is therefore ordered that the said alcee l hastings 
be and is hereby removed from office 
hastings was the sixth federal official removed as a result of 
impeachment 
flanked by his attorneys the 53yearold judge watched the 
proceedings from a table on the floor of the senate as one by one 
the lawmakers answered the roll call he left the chamber a few 
minutes after the first of the articles was voted 
hastings problems began on oct 9 1981 when his friend 
washington dc attorney william borders was arrested in an 
undercover operation of alleged fixing of court cases borders was 
convicted of bribery conspiracy but hastings was acquitted in a 
separate 1983 jury trial 
however a subsequent investigation led to hastings impeachment 
last year in the house which accused him of plotting to obtain a 
bribe lying during his trial and an unrelated charge of improperly 
disclosing federal wiretap information 
borders served a prison term in the case and currently is in 
jail on contempt charges for refusing to testify in the impeachment 
trial after being granted immunity from prosecution 
i have no choice but to accept their judgment hastings said 
after the vote in a statement that criticized the proceedings as 
unjust 
in my opinion their judgment is void of the wisdom of the 
forefathers teachings regarding impeachment hastings said he 
said the case gives new meaning to double jeopardy and renders a 
severe blow to the cornerstone of justice the jury system 
what the senate has said is a standard of almost proven 
innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a judge or 
executive officer by way of impeachment he said that is 
chilling and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm 
the senate impeachment trial was not a criminal proceeding 
thus hastings stands removed as a judge but remains a free man 
without any criminal record 
hastings said he was hopeful that some book offers will come 
along 
there are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born 
of this saga they need to be told and tell them i shall he said 
senators sat silently at their desks as the roll was called 
when the first tally was announced defense attorney terence j 
anderson showed the roll call to hastings who then offered his 
hand and shook hands firmly with the lawyer 
the senate acted after a sevenhour closeddoor session 
thursday night that found it divided over the charges 
hastings has been proclaiming his innocence for eight years and 
while he won some converts it was short of what he needed for 
acquittal in the senate 
sen arlen specter rpa on thursday became the first senator 
to reveal his position saying in a 76page paper he would vote for 
acquittal 
specter said that after weighing the incriminating 
circumstantial inferences against the exonerating factors and 
giving due weight to his other unblemished lifetime record i 
conclude there is insufficient evidence to convict hastings of 
the bribery conspiracy charge 
he said it was clear that prosecutors told jurors at the 1983 
trial that hastings lied in denying his guilt 
obviously the jury did not accept those arguments said 
specter who served as district attorney of philadelphia for eight 
years 
he said the allegation that hastings improperly disclosed 
wiretap information in which dade county fla mayor steve clark 
was a key witness was neither convincing nor substantial 
while there was direct evidence in the testimony of mayor 
clark a number of factors made mayor clark a less than wholly 
credible witness specter said

sports officials from north korea and 
south korea on friday announced their first breakthrough in 
monthsold talks on the asian games they agreed on a flag to be 
used by athletes from both nations 
progress also was reported on plans to form a single team for 
the games next year in beijing but obstacles remain such as what 
to call the team 
there was a considerable progress on the flag and others 
including the selection of athletes for the joint team north 
koreas chief delegate kim hyung jin said after the fourhour 
meeting at the panmunjom truce site 
we will do our best to form the first single team in our 
history and we in turn expect the south to do so he said 
his south korean counterpart chang chungsik also reported 
progress 
the northern side was rather active and straightforward and 
there was some progress but i would not say the prospect is 100 
percent bright chang said after the meeting which was open to 
the press 
the talks were businesslike with both sides avoiding political 
exchanges recent talks have bogged down in acrimonious political 
exchanges 
sports officials of the two koreas met twice early this year 
before north korea unilaterally suspended dialogue in april to 
protest the arrest of south korean dissident clergyman moon 
ikhwan moon was arrested for visiting north korea without 
permission from the south korean government 
north korea has been demanding moons release but north korean 
officials did not raise the issue friday 
delegates of the two koreas quickly agreed on a flag to be used 
by the first interkorea joint team at the asian games the flag 
will have a map of the korean peninsula in blue on a white 
background 
it is the first time both koreas have agreed on a joint flag for 
an international sports event since they first started talks on 
forming a single team for the 1964 olympics in tokyo all efforts 
to form a joint team for any event so far have failed 
both koreas also agreed in principle to select athletes for the 
single team through joint training and open competition 
they could not agree on the name of the team both sides agreed 
to use korea as the english name of the team but could not decide 
what name to use in korean 
north korea proposed nov 2 as a date of the next meeting but 
south korea suggested nov 22 they settled on nov 16 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north korea and 
capitalist south korea in 1945

congressional districts are redrawn to account for shifts in 
population 
under an amendment approved by the senate the use of federal 
funds would have been prohibited for counting illegal aliens for 
the purpose of congressional reapportionment 
a housesenate conference committee however voted thursday to 
drop the senate amendment when it approved appropriations for the 
judiciary and the commerce state and justice departments 
states with large numbers of illegal aliens such as texas 
california and florida could gain new congressional seats as a 
result of the decision 
inclusion of illegal aliens in the count has been strongly 
opposed by legislators with few of those residents who fear loss of 
influence in congress 
the outcome was never in doubt because the constitution could 
not be clearer the constitution says that apportionment is based 
on the number of persons and everybody is entitled to their own 
opinion but not their own constitution said sen phil gramm 
rtexas a member of the conference committee 
illegal aliens have always been counted in the census because of 
the requirement to include all persons living in the country 
census bureau officials have pointed out that they would have no 
way to exclude illegal aliens since citizenship is not asked in 
the national head count 
the issue of counting illegal aliens has pitted sun belt states

british airways plc said today it was pulling out 
of a group attempting to buy ual corp dealing a heavy blow to 
plans by the us companys management and employees to acquire the 
parent of united airlines 
last week the groups announcement that it was unable to 
finance its planned 675 billion buyout triggered a nosedive by 
the new york stock exchange that roiled markets worldwide 
since then the group and its advisers have been seeking 
financial backing for a revised offer at a lower price 
ual stock which has taken a pounding since the groups oct 13 
announcement took another dive in early trading today on the new 
york stock exchange ual was down 2112 a share at 169 at 
midday bringing its decline so far this week to about 110 
british airways as late as last weekend indicated it was 
confident a revised buyout plan could be arranged but in recent 
days company officials have indicated that british air was not 
necessarily wedded to a deal 
british airways issued a brief statement today saying it does 
not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of 
ual in the foreseeable future 
after banks refused to back the original ual deal the buyout 
group led by management and united pilots scaled down its original 
300 a share offer to 562 billion or 250 a share ual officials 
have been in tokyo this week trying to win support for the revised 
offer from big japanese banks 
united is the secondlargest us airline after american 
airlines the deal if successful would be the largest 
employeeled buyout of a us company 
joe hopkins a spokesman for chicagobased ual said the company 
had no comment on the action by british airways 
last weekend british airways issued a statement saying it was 
confident a revised financing package would be arranged and the bid 
would be allowed to proceed on monday the company confirmed it 
was pursuing the bid with airlines acquisition corp the 
managementled group that also includes united pilots 
a british airways spokesman who was not identified in 
accordance with british custom said he could not comment beyond 
the prepared statement which gave no indication of why british 
airways backed out or when the decision was made 
under the original offer british airways would have provided 
750 million or about threequarters of the equity for the 
leveraged buyout and would have received a 15 percent stake in the 
airline

ronald and nancy reagan arrived here friday on a 
visit for which the former president reportedly will receive 2 
million and the japanese government said it will award him one of 
its highest honors 
the reagans arrived on a chartered twa boeing 747 along with 229 
us military dependents they invited to hitch a ride to the far 
east 
reagan will receive the grand cordon of the supreme order of the 
chrysanthemum for his contribution to the maintenance and 
promotion of friendship between the united states and japan said 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
mr reagan has always been clear in refusing protectionism and 
tried his best to maintain the free trade system watanabe said 
the only other us president to receive the honor was dwight 
eisenhower 
the reagans are in japan at the invitation of the japanese 
government and the fujisankei communications group fujisankei has 
refused to confirm reports reagan will receive about 2 million for 
the visit which it said will cost a total of about 7 million 
fujisankei japans largest media group owns the newspaper 
sankei shimbun the fuji telecasting corp and nippon hoso japans 
biggest commercial radio network among dozens of other companies 
like fujisankeis chairman nobutaka shikanai many of the

firefighter lee kraft was visibly shaken 
after he crawled into an 18inchhigh opening on the collapsed 
nimitz freeway to pull out the bodies of a 6yearold girl and her 
mother 
it kills you it just kills you we all have families you 
know the adults are no problem but the kids he said 
thursday before trailing off dabbing tears 
the carnage on the highway also known as interstate 880 upset 
even the most veteran of rescue workers here on a 1milelong 
section of interstate just south of the bay bridge tuesdays 
earthquake was its deadliest 
using shovels backhoes cranes and their hands workers had 
recovered 21 bodies and located 52 vehicles between the pancaked 
decks of the highway by early today twentythree of them were 
empty single bodies were removed from nine of them and 20 others 
were yet to be investigated in addition 45 cars and trucks were 
pulled off the shattered upper deck or from the streets below 
authorities said 
but 167 people remained on the official missing list today for 
alameda county which includes oakland and several other 
communities dozens of vehicles still were sandwiched between tons 
of concrete 
early estimates put the number of dead at 250 people but 
officials said thursday night that they expected the total would be 
lower possibly much lower 
some rescuers working around the clock stubbornly clung to 
hopes that someone might be found alive in the highway debris 
others including kraft had no hopes 
we havent found a live one yet and i dont think we will 
he said 
the even layers of the twotiered elevated highway lay buckled 
and twisted like a writhing serpent their concrete supports 
sheared off 
on the railing of the flattened upper deck spray paint pointed 
the way to crushed cars and shattered bodies 1doa signified a 
body 2mt a pair of empty cars a circle and arrow with the number 
43 stood for a car 43 feet away 
you could see blood splattered everywhere on the concrete 
said volunteer jason losorio taking a break after a 13hour shift 
that included moving concrete chunks by hand 
the scene drew hundreds of onlookers on thursday including many 
who feared a relative or friend might be buried 
during a live broadcast of cbstvs 48 hours an angry man 
who believes his son may be in the wreckage confronted mayor lionel 
wilson 
mayor did you know that you are directly responsible for this 
here mess this disaster asked daniel rubi of san francisco 
rubi said he had been turned away on wednesday when he asked to 
climb the freeway structure and search for his son juan 
the mayor replied im sorry i cant answer that question 
police took rubi away but did not place him under arrest 
authorities say it could be at least three days before workers 
reach all the trapped vehicles thereby getting an accurate count 
after that the highway will be demolished 
rumors of survivors periodically swept through the crowds of 
rescue workers reporters and bystanders only to be knocked down 
by officials each time 
wednesday night brought reports that a rescuer had touched a 
live human hand in the wreckage it was a false alarm 
losorio said he sneaked in without permission between the 
levels wednesday night and spotted the forms of four or five people 
in their mangled vehicles 
they may have been unconscious he said but he left because of 
the danger and he agreed with rescue leaders caution about 
sending workers into dangerous sections 
all that might happen is someone else would get hurt he 
said 
a burly carpenter who declined to give his name said he had seen 
incredible bravery by his fellow carpenters and ironworkers 
i saw people crawling in there in places where they werent 
sure a branch was holding them up running torches in places they 
werent sure there was gas because they had to 
four carpenters worked til 2 this morning and went to their 
regular jobs at 7 and theyll be back tonight he said were 
here just because we believe in it

leaders of commonwealth nations left for a weekend retreat on 
langkawi island diplomats said differences remained on indias 
proposal for an new enviornmental fund which britain opposes 
on south african sanctions weve agreed to disagree a 
canadian official said privately no details were released 
commonwealth leaders were to consider both drafts at langkawi 
where they settled into luxury twobedroom chalets at a beach hotel

and the need to look at how to set negotiations in train 
mrs thatcher told the summit fw de klerk south africas new 
president should be encouraged in his moves toward reform 
australia countered that pressure should be maintained as long 
as south africa continued apartheid the policy of race 
discrimination that enables the 5 million whites to maintain 
supremacy over 28 million blacks 
its proposal would withhold pressure on trade for for about six 
months to give de klerk time to deliver on promises of reform 
south africa quit the commonwealth in 1961

a fund and said all resources should be channeled through the un 
world environmental program 
many other delegations also expressed reservations about a new 
fund

the bush administration has decided to forbid 
american citizens from having financial dealings with panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega as well as more than 30 firms in which he 
has an interest officials said today 
many of these businesses serve as intermediaries in trade 
between the united states and cuba which has been illegal since 
1960 the sources said 
the move serves to tighten the embargo against cuba and also to 
penalize panamanian firms controlled by noriega and his wife said 
the administration officials who asked not to be identified 
americans who violate the new measure scheduled to be announced 
next week could face fines of up to 500000 according to the 
officials 
the step was first reported by the los angeles times asked 
about the report state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
refused comment 
the administration has been groping for ways to punish noriega 
without further damaging the panamanian economy which has declined 
steeply over the past 18 months as a result of earlier sanctions 
imposed by the united states 
meanwhile spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez today renewed 
his call for the departure of noriega but said he opposes any us 
military move to achieve that goal 
winding up a twoday visit with a news conference gonzalez 
praised president bushs decision not to use force in helping rebel 
officers in their bid to oust noriega two weeks ago 
interventionism is never desirable gonzalez said through a 
translator im very pleased to know that it has not happened 
gonzalez has offered some ideas for resolving panamas crisis 
but he acknowledged that a solution cannot be achieved by third 
countries 
it should be a panamanian solution otherwise there will be no 
solution he said 
gonzalez spoke to reporters at blair house after conferring 
thursday night with bush on the panama situation today he gave 
few details of the exchange and declined to characterize bushs 
position 
following an earlier meeting bush called spain a model for 
eastern european nations to follow in their moves toward democratic 
reforms 
bush praised spains involvement in the european community and 
the 24nation group that is providing economic assistance to poland 
and hungary he also noted spains own move from dictatorship to 
democracy 
gonzalezs idea for removing noriega involves electing a new 
panamanian president who would have the power to name a new 
military commander to replace noriega in contrast to bushs stated 
wish the proposal would not require that noriega return to the 
united states to face a drugtrafficking indictment 
raymond seitz assistant secretary of state for european and 
canadian affairs said the us position has not changed asked if 
the administration was flexible however he said sure 
privately another administration official said the primary us 
goal is to get noriega out of power while the secondary goal is to 
try him on the drug case 
meanwhile the bush administration said thursday it may speed up 
the planned withdrawal of us military dependents from panama 
gen maxwell r thurman the newly appointed us military 
commander in panama also has recommended shortening soldiers tour 
of duty so that fewer bring their families to panama a pentagon 
official said 
bush gonzalez and top advisers discussed a range of issues 
including economic and political reforms in poland and hungary the 
upcoming elections in nicaragua international antidrug efforts 
and their roles in the north atlantic treaty alliance said seitz 
bush had warm words for spain despite the rough patch in 
usspanish relations that had occurred until last year when the 
united states agreed to reduce its military presence in the 
southern european nation 
spain insisted that the united states remove a group of f16 
fighter planes based in the country italy agreed to accept them 
the united states still has a military presence in spain that 
represents the maturing of the defense relationship between the 
two countries seitz said

the setting was westminster abbey but the event 
was pure theater as britains finest actors paid tribute friday to 
laurence olivier and listened to henry v spoken by the master 
himself 
the taperecording of the st crispins day speech from 
shakespeares play highlighted a ceremony of music poetry and 
thanksgiving for the awesome talent of olivier who died july 11 at 
82 
there may be imitators but there is no second olivier said 
sir alec guinness eulogist at a ceremony brimming with eloquence 
affection and a whos who of theatrical greats among the 
congregation of 2000 
guinness was joined by fellow acting knights john gielgud john 
mills and dame peggy ashcroft in reciting from shakespeare the 
bible john milton and john donne 
oliviers widow actress joan plowright sat in the front row 
flanked by family members 
a theatrical procession to the high altar began with douglas 
fairbanks jr carrying oliviers order of merit insignia next was 
michael caine holding his late colleagues honorary academy award 
from 1979 
others in the pageant were derek jacobi ian mckellen frank 
finlay maggie smith dorothy tutin paul scofield and peter 
otoole albert finney read from ecclesiastes 
for 60 years he moved astonished and teased his public he 
could interpret human nature at its noblest at its most comic and 
at its most pitiable said the dean of westminster the very rev 
michael mayne who conducted the service 
guinness address was witty elegant anecdotal and moving eyes 
moistened as the 75yearold actor quoted from hamlet 
good night sweet prince 
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest 
guinness said olivier stands alongside the acknowledged great 
burbage betterton garrick kean and irving 
even allowing for violent changes of fashion i feel that each 
of those tremendous actors of the past would have recognized his 
style applauded him and welcomed him as one of their own 
great a muchabused word readily applied to olivier 
guinness said perhaps it consists of a happy combination of 
imagination physical magnetism a commanding and appealing voice 
an expressive eye and danger 
ashcroft 81 oliviers classmate at the central school of 
drama recited passages from miltons poem lycidas with 
piercing grace and beauty 
as the gothic church windows glistened in noon sunshine 
gielgud 85 flooded westminster abbey with his beautiful voice

and the actors fund in the united states 
lord olivier as he became with his ennoblement in 1970 was 
cremated at a family funeral in southern england his ashes will be 
laid to rest in westminster abbey next year 
afterward actor jack lemmon said the service was not too 
downbeat i enjoyed it very much 
jacobi said olivier would have liked the service hed have 
been outside the abbey around the front counting the takings he 
chuckled 
mckellen said it was a solemn happy occasion full of 
wonderful traditions and music 
discussion of potential heirs was quickly dismissed with 
guinness eulogy setting the tone sometimes we read in the press 
of a young actor being hailed as a second olivier that is 
nonsense of course he was unique 
echoed michael york there will never never be another

will lofty prices for california real estate 
tumble along with the roadways bridges and homes devastated by 
this weeks quake dont bet the house on it especially in the 
eternally optimistic golden state 
ive been here for over 60 years and ive been through them 
all including the 1933 earthquake that hit long beach and that 
was a bummer said thelma orloff of the fred sands brokerage in 
los angeles who listed joan collins house at 6 million and 
lucille balls at 69 million 
but an earthquake takes what 15 seconds and then its over 
for 30 years and if youre fortunate your foundation is safe and 
your house is safe she said and if youre taking earthquake 
insurance and the house is destroyed then you rebuild 
prices meanwhile just keep going up and up ms orloff 
said 
experts in san francisco said some multimilliondollar deals for 
office buildings have been put on hold while damage inspections are 
made and prices of homes may drop briefly because of the northern 
california quake 
but those effects will be temporary they suggested 
particularly because severe damage is limited to a few older areas 
roadways and bridges even in san franciscos marina district 
devastation was limited to eight square blocks of old homes built 
on landfill perhaps onetenth of the district itself 
you hate to say its not devastated that much but theres 
only small pockets that have been substantially damaged in the 
city san francisco realtors association president victor makras 
said friday 
no ones phone is ringing to buy today everyone is working 
with their present buyers to educate and comfort them makras 
said but i think that once the city services are back and up and 
rolling we will be back to a similar situation to what we had 
prices will intimidate people more than earthquakes in the long 
run said california association of realtors spokesman joel singer 
in august just 10 percent of the households in the bay area 
could afford the areas medianpriced home of 272016 as 
calculated by a realty board affordability index which among 
other things assumes a 20 percent down payment average loan rate 
and a 30year loan 
harold a ellis the chairman and chief executive of san 
franciscobased grubb amp ellis a major national broker for 
commercial and residential real estate said deals would be delayed 
while buyers and lenders assess potential damages 
but ellis said san franciscos commercial real estate market had 
been picking up since spring buoyed by a general upturn in the 
areas economy and he and makras predict that trend will continue 
i think memories will be very short ellis said

the millions of soviets who see the world through 
the gray pages of the communist party daily pravda were told friday 
their newspaper had a new chief a reformist philosopher and top 
aide to mikhail s gorbachev 
the appointment of ivan t frolov as pravdas editor seems to 
consolidate the soviet presidents grip on the flagship party 
daily which has noticeably lagged behind other official newspapers 
in printing the sort of eyeopening criticism encouraged by the 
kremlins campaign for glasnost or more openness 
as pravdas circulation has sagged to 93 million that of more 
feisty publications such as ogonyok and arguments and facts has 
soared thus the influence on public opinion of the partys most 
authoritative newspaper was visibly on the wane 
a joke shows the current popular view of the newspaper which 
was founded by vladimir i lenin in 1912 as an instrument to 
overthrow the russian czar and whose name means truth 
theres no truth in izvestia goes the joke referring to 
the soviet governments evening paper whose name means news 
and the joke continues theres no news in pravda 
frolov 60 erstwhile editor of the party theoretical monthly 
journal kommunist replaces viktor g afanasyev a whitehaired 
holdover from the era of leonid i brezhnev sovie leader from 1964 
to 1982 afanasyev 66 had served as pravdas editorinchief for 
13 years 
western sources identify the russianborn graduate of moscow 
universitys philosophy department as gorbachevs personal adviser 
on ideological matters frolov is also reputed to be the countrys 
top biomedical ethicist and in the 1960s criticized stalins 
henchman biologist trofim lysenko for waging an ideological 
witchhunt against colleagues that led to the exile torture and 
death of many talented scientists 
in the 1970s frolov reportedly fell from favor because of his 
reformist views he was rehabilitated after gorbachev became soviet 
leader in 1985 
frolovs latest appointment was made by the ruling party 
politburo and announced by pravda in a page one report on the 
politburos thursday meeting the report was also read on staterun 
tv thursday night 
a pravda worker said friday that frolov had not yet started 
work gorbachev was expected to go to the papers headquarters on 
pravda street in northwest moscow to present frolov personally to 
the staff the worker said 
afanasyev the no 1 journalist in the soviet pecking order by 
virtue of his position as pravdas chief editor and chairman of the 
official union of journalists had spoken out for glasnost once 
complaining there were still restricted zones where coverage 
wasnt permitted 
but he still favored keeping government processes under strong 
communist party control rejected the notion that there should be 
competing political parties and warned against allowing criticism 
of communist policy to go too far 
his clout as pravda editor was considerable he once revealed he 
was allowed to attend politburo meetings but under his tutelage 
pravda printed the same terse tass bulletins on the politburos 
doings that appear in every other soviet paper and little more 
frolov has been working as an assistant to gorbachev the 
partys general secretary tass said in a brief biographical note 
in that post soviet sources say he helped author a major change 
in the philosophical underpinnings of kremlin foreign policy 
for decades the soviets were ideologically committed to aiding 
the worldwide class struggle but in 1987 presumably due to 
gorbachevs impetus they proclaimed instead their adherence to 
universal human values meaning they would cooperate with 
regimes once regarded as enemies 
frolov a doctor of philosophical sciences headed the journal 
questions of philosophy in 198677 and has been chairman of the 
nations philosophical society since 1987 the same year he became 
an aide to gorbachev 
he served as chief editor of kommunist in 198687 watershed 
years in the elaboration of party doctrine when the gorbachevera 
policies of glasnost and perestroika or reconstruction 
were being hammered out and put to practical use 
according to tass frolov also wrote a book along with another 
top party official fated to become a gorbachev adviser vadim 
zagladin titled global problems of our times scientific and 
global aspects 
frolov is a member of the partys policymaking central 
committee and its ideological commission and a member of the 
prestigious soviet academy of sciences department of law and 
philosophy he also has a seat in the new soviet parliament the 
congress of peoples deputies 
western references report frolov was a philosophy student at 
moscow state university in 1953 the same period the future raisa 
gorbachev was enrolled there to study the same subject gorbachev 
the son of a southern russian peasant was in the universitys law 
school at the time

just days after a major earthquake closed those same offices in san 
francisco 
the fire was limited to an unoccupied machinery room on top of 
the building but other offices were closed while firefighters 
inspected the building said city fire department spokesman greg 
acevedo 
more than 250 firefighters battled the blaze which broke out 
about 1235 am and was doused about 40 minutes later acevedo 
said 
three helicopters transported crews to the roof of the building 
where firefighters gained control of the blaze from above he said 
the firefighters on the roof obviously played a big role in 
putting the fire out because the building was tall acevedo said 
firefighters were hampered slightly by work in the building to 
remove asbestos insulation acevedo said he said no one was inside 
the structure when the fire started and there were no injuries 
reported 
firefighters were not sure what caused the fire acevedo said 
adding that no damage estimate was available 
the wilshire district which includes several highrise office 
buildings is located a little more than one mile west of downtown 
on tuesday a 69magnitude quake seriously damaged the historic 
state office building in san francisco making unsafe the offices 
of attorney general john van de kamp the state supreme court and 
court of appeals

about 50000 peasants whose homes were destroyed 
by earthquakes prepared friday to spend a second night outdoors on 
the windy north china plain 
no new deaths were reported friday leaving the toll at 29 dead 
with more than 150 injured many peasants said they survived 
because the first quake wednesday night woke them up and sent them 
outdoors a stronger quake early thursday brought their homes down 
two more strong aftershocks were felt friday morning 
this was the worst quake weve ever had liu rongzhen a 
peasant in xicaitian village in shanxi province told a western 
reporter about half the 230 houses in the village made of mud or 
sticks and branches suffered varying degrees of damage 
all the homes were destroyed in nearby bucun a village of 
1280 two villagers were killed a man and the elderly mother he 
was trying to carry to safety 
the survivors rigged tents of quilts and straw and built small 
fires thursday night and prepared to do the same friday night 
temperatures in beijing 135 miles to the east have been 
dipping below 40 degrees at night with a chill wind weather in the 
quakeaffected area is similar 
the ministry of civil affairs in charge of emergency rescue 
refused friday to answer questions and referred callers to the 
international department of the ministry of foreign economic 
relations and trade 
there an official who gave his name only as xu said 11000 
homes had been destroyed in shanxi and hebei provinces and 50000 
people were homeless he had no other information 
shanxi villagers seemed dazed and unsure about how to begin 
rebuilding we just hope that the earthquakes stop liu said 
he said he lost his home and most of his possessions worth a 
total of about 800 he and others said it would not be possible to 
rebuild their homes before winter sets in but they had no idea 
what they would do for shelter 
some victims dug with shovels and poles beneath the mounds of 
mud and stone that were their homes but found little that could be 
salvaged one woman found an unbroken light bulb 
someone else found a black and white television a prized 
possession in poor areas such as shanxi and set it carefully on a 
pile of straw 
national tv broadcast its first report on the quake and said the 
government had set up a special fund of 53850 for quake aid 
the television showed boxes of medicine being unloaded from a 
pickup truck an official distributed thick pancakes a local 
staple from a pile heaped high on the ground 
the report said more than 1000 soldiers and medical workers 
were sent into the area footage shot by shanxi provincial tv but 
not shown on the national news showed doctors in makeshift clinics 
treating people with broken bones and badly bloodied heads 
the national news focused on local officials arriving to inspect 
damage and only briefly showed an adobe home in ruins and doctors 
treating a victim the official media has given little attention to 
the quake perhaps because of continued popular belief that natural 
disasters spell out heavens displeasure with the ruler 
although losses were heavy the morale of the masses is 
stable the television news said there has been no announcement 
of plans to provide temporary shelter for the homeless or rebuild 
the destroyed homes 
the state seismology bureau has said it is unlikely that more 
strong aftershocks will hit in the near future 
the bureau said the thursday morning quake which measured 61 
on the richter scale was the strongest to hit northern china since 
a 1976 earthquake that leveled most of the northeast city of 
tangshan and killed 240000 people 
the richter scale gauges the energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
tuesdays earthquake in northern california was measured at 69 on 
the scale

a former south african government 
employee said authorities have set up an intelligence operation 
designed to influence the elections in namibia a newspaper 
reported friday 
officials even told the covert team to find embarrassing 
informaton on un officials as part of an effort to ensure that a 
black nationalist group does come to power susan dobson was quoted 
as saying by the namibian newspaper 
mrs dobson quit her job in south africas bureau of information 
and subsequently claimed she had been a spy for the african 
national congress while working for the government 
she was quoted friday as saying that her part of her duties with 
the bureau of information included a campaign to discredit the 
southwest africa peoples organization and the un contingent 
that is coordinating namibias transition to independence 
louis pienaar the south african administrator of namibia 
denied covert activities were being conducted by his office he 
said the bureau of information was involved in telling the public 
about election procedures and that the south african government 
provided additional staff for that purpose 
however a un official said authorities with the world body 
believe a covert smear campaign might exist 
i would have to confess the report did not take us totally 
by surprise said un spokesman fred eckhard referring to mrs 
dobsons allegations 
there was a pattern that certainly raised questions in our 
minds whether there might not be some kind of orchestrated effort 
by the south africans he said 
south africa has ruled namibia for 74 years but agreed to grant 
the territory independence under un supervison elections for a 
national assembly are set for nov 711 and independence is 
expected early next year 
the southwest africa peoples organization which waged a 
23year bush war against south african rule is heavily favored in 
the polls 
mrs dobson abruptly left her job in the namibian capital of 
windhoek on sept 23 and flew to london with her south african 
husband peter dobson the namibian which supports the southwest 
africa peoples organization interviewed the couple there 
mrs dobson said she was part of a sevenmember government 
contingent with a 13 million budget 
the group was to help promote the democratic turnhalle alliance 
a multiracial coalition that favors a capitalist economy 
she said the team was instructed to gather information on un 
officials for the purpose of embarrassing them the group had an 
entertainment allowance of 38000 for this purpose she told the 
newspaper 
any embarrassing information was to be fed to selected 
journalists working for newspapers opposed to the black 
nationalist group she said 
mrs dobson said she also was sent to interview hans dreyer 
commander of the notorious police counterinsurgency unit koevoet 
she said she was told to portray the unit as a group of ordinary 
decent people doing a great job 
mrs dobson said her group included two members of the south 
african defense force a police inspector and intelligence 
officials 
she said she and her husband have worked for the outlawed 
african national congress for 10 years she said they fled because 
they believed they had been uncovered 
dave steward head of the bureau of information said wednesday 
that mrs dobson was a junior official who did not have access to 
sensitive material the information she gained was available to 
anyone

pope john paul ii on friday welcomed 
polands first noncommunist prime minister in 40 years and told 
him there must be no turning back from political change 
tadeusz mazowiecki a longtime solidarity activist who came to 
power aug 24 thanked the polishborn pope for his support 
during the difficult years referring to the suppression of 
solidarity after the martial law crackdown in 1981 
mazowiecki a catholic intellectual and an old friend of the 
pope made rome his first foreign visit since his appointment as 
the east blocs first noncommunist premier 
the pope called the private 20minute meeting historic 
in an emotional reunion the men embraced outside the popes 
private library john paul told an aide there was no need for 
introductions 
later mazowiecki said the meeting was the crowning the fruit 
of the dialogue of which today we see the results 
john paul turned toward a polish tv crew and responded in 
polish we hope theres no turning back 
this is not possible seconded foreign minister krzysztof 
skubiszewski 
john pauls return to poland in june 1979 eight months after 
his election to the papacy helped spark demands for democracy that 
led to the formation of solidarity the first noncommunist labor 
movement in the soviet bloc 
mazowiecki told a news conference that polishsoviet relations 
are at their most crucial moment 
he said there are many problems but one of the biggest is 
economic collaboration 
we want to develop our economy through the east and the 
west he said noting that he would discuss these problems when 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze comes to warsaw next 
week during that visit a date for a mazowiecki visit to moscow 
will be set 
he also repeated his plea for immediate help from the west 
saying his country needs loans investments and emergency food aid 
within the next two months to help it through the harsh polish 
winter 
the church which has historically played a pivotal role in this 
overwhelmingly roman catholic country took part in the long 
negotiations that led to elections this year and approval of a 
24member cabinet that includes 12 solidarity members and four 
communists 
as evidence of the change sweeping the soviet bloc john paul on 
friday ordained as bishops the vaticans first ambassador to poland 
since the communists broke diplomatic relations after world war ii 
and the first roman catholic bishop in soviet byelorussia in 60 
years 
isnt this a sign of the changes taking place which are 
happening for the good of all believers john paul said in his 
homily in the service in st peters basilica 
aides said mazowiecki and the pope have met some 20 times during 
john pauls 11year pontificate most recently when solidarity 
leader lech walesa came to rome in april 
the polish pope and prime minister also met privately at lunch 
after the audience

the failure of recent peace efforts has 
dimmed prospects for repatriation of the more than 300000 
cambodians in refugee camps on the thai side of the border aid 
workers said friday 
repatriation is undoubtedly farther away from us than it 
appeared even three months ago said urs boegli head of the 
thailand office of the international committee of the red cross 
many aid officials had felt increased diplomatic efforts put a 
settlement within reach but an international conference in paris 
in june did not resolve the civil war which began with the 
vietnamese invasion of december 1978 
about 300000 of the cambodians who fled the brutal khmer rouge 
regime or the invasion that ended it remain in the unassisted 
camps 
fighting nearby has intensified since vietnamese soldiers left 
cambodia late in september and boegli said the camps are exposed 
to increased danger 
do we have to fear a fullfledged attack on the camps he 
said of course this possibilty has to remain part of our 
security planning 
he said the presence of guerrillas in the camps increased the 
danger 
the united nations recently reduced food aid to the largest 
camp site 2 on grounds the rebels were diverting supplies to 
their own use khmer rouge guerrillas control the camp which 
houses 140000 refugees 
although repatriation may be delayed aid agencies still must 
prepare for it said sams kibria un special representative 
for cambodian refugees 
the time has come to look beyond our established role of 
providing basic emergency relief and consider greater emphasis on 
social program to support and rebuild cambodian society he said 
there are children as old as 10 or 12 who have never known 
life outside a refugee camp kibria said and the longer they 
remain the more serious becomes the risk that we will return 
to cambodia whole communities of socially handicapped persons 
unable to earn a living or readjust to conditions in their own 
country 
kibria said more money was needed to finance reintegration 
programs 
he also expressed concern about reports that guerrillas may move 
refugees back into cambodia without involving international 
organizations 
any movement of the population into cambodia which lacks the 
assurances of safety and freedom of choice cannot be supported 
he said 
toshiyuki niwa director of the un border relief operation 
said the breakdown of peace talks could increase frustration among 
the refugees in camps already plagued by murder rape and other 
crimes

the kgb plans to cut the restricted border zones 
it guards to a 10th of their current size and take down the barbed 
wire in many areas top officials of the agency told a soviet 
legislative committee friday 
bordercrossing procedures will also be simplified tass said in 
a report on a session of the new committee that oversees the kgb 
and the defense ministry 
vladimir a kryuchkov head of the kgb told the panel there was 
no reason to maintain such a large border zone the news agency 
said it did not specify the total area of the zone that the 
200000 border guards protect now or how it will be reduced in the 
future 
the border plan was typical of recent kgb efforts to show that 
it is moving away from a cold war mentality and trying to keep pace 
with the kremlins push for greater openness and democracy 
kryuchkov has given several interviews to the soviet media and 
he defended the kgb before the legislature at his confirmation last 
summer saying it stayed strictly within the law at home 
about 3400 people were nabbed for illegally crossing into the 
border zone since the beginning of last year kgb deputy chief 
vadim matrosov told the defense and security committee 
he said the southern soviet border particularly where it 
touches on afghanistan requires extra frontier guards to combat 
smuggling and armed gangs tass said 
but in general matrosov said the soviet unions improving 
relations with most of its neighbors including china iran and 
nato members turkey and norway has led to reduced tension on its 
border 
in some places along the chinese frontier the forbidden zone is 
hundreds of miles thick even along the border with its warsaw pact 
allies the soviet union has strung barbed wire and set armed kgb 
guards in towers foreigners are barred from a 16mile strip along 
the soviet border with norway finland iran turkey and 
afghanistan 
the country plans to remove the barbedwire entanglement in 
many areas tass said 
the soviet unions border with china alone is 3000 miles the 
longest land border between two countries 
the defense and security committee was created as part of 
political reforms aimed at giving more real power to the supreme 
soviet legislature which was formerly a rubberstamp for communist 
party decisions

the voice of alcee l hastings boomed out of 
the drizzle in the chill air outside the senate entrance to the 
capitol 
hastings had just been convicted on the first of many articles 
of impeachment an act that formally removed him from office as a 
federal district judge for the southern district of florida 
the former judge had a surprise in store 
in the senate chamber sen robert c byrd dwva the 
senates president pro tempore gravely asked the question yet 
another time 
senators how say you is the respondent alcee l hastings 
guilty or not guilty 
and the voices came guilty guilty not guilty 
guilty over and over 
hastings had left the voices behind after the second vote to 
convict him striding from the chamber to receive bearhugs from 
supporters in a morning consumed by votes by senators soberly 
rising from their gleaming mahogany desks he would be convicted on 
eight counts acquitted on three 
outside on the steps alcee hastings who had been the first 
black federal judge in florida history looked out over the 
thrusting cameras and microphones his commanding voice penetrating 
through the crowd 
his conviction was unjust he said the fact that a jury had in 
1983 acquitted him on similar charges marked his impeachment before 
the senate with the brand of double jeopardy and dealt a severe 
blow to the cornerstone of justice the jury system 
hastings then took a wholly unexpected tack 
defiant smiling appearing supremely selfconfident hastings 
said that as far as he is concerned his career was far from over 
now that the senate has forced a career change on me i must 
go forward he said 
he will go forward he said to become a democratic candidate 
for governor of florida to become a far from ordinary candidate 
hastings said he had called his mother immediately after the 
first of the votes first to tell her the result then to say 
were off and running 
i think i have an excellent chance he said i dont 
have anything to lose by offering an interest in the issues facing 
the voters of florida i think i can take the campaign to a level 
that everybody will be proud of 
quite frankly i think that not only can i be elected i think 
i will be im going to enjoy being governor 
a reporter asked why do you think you can be elected after 
what just happened 
hastings responded because i think that floridians are tired 
of ordinariness and if theres anything else i bring to it its 
this experience its not ordinary 
oh i will hear signals hastings said i will hear oh 
its shameful that he should do these kinds of things 
let me tell you my mama had a man she did not have anybody 
that was afraid of the system i think change needs to take place 
and im going to be involved in that change until i die 
he said there are no legal barriers to his candidacy 
banishment is a fiction he insisted and pointing upwards 
in the direction of the senate chamber added and what we just 
saw was extremely fictional there are those of you who will say 
i should be banished in infamy i know nothing that i have done 
that requires that 
but hastings also made clear that there may be something 
quixotic in his candidacy 
i will go forward with my life and ill let the voters of 
florida tell me that im a terrible person and i will go forward 
with my life he said 
was he at all downcast by the fact of his conviction 
i feel just fine hastings said crisply emphasizing each 
word perhaps better than i did quite some time ago

opposition parties trying to unseat 
prime minister rajiv gandhi in elections next month said friday 
they would fight corruption ease poverty and restore national 
dignity 
a 40page platform waved at a news conference by vishwanath 
pratap singh gandhis chief rival and a senior leader of the 
national front coalition offers few radical departures from 
indias current stated policies 
in many respects it recalls pledges gandhi made five years ago 
when his congress party was reelected in a landslide after the 
assassination of his mother prime minister indira gandhi 
elections scheduled for nov 22 24 and 26 will choose a new 
lower house of parliament which holds the political power in india 
the opposition platform reserved its sharpest barbs for 
corruption the rallying cry of singhs campaign to lead the 880 
million people of the worlds most populous democracy 
singh a 58yearold former congress party member and gandhi 
ally echoed his platforms call for full investigation of the 
bofors arms scandal the swedish manufacturer is accused of paying 
up to 50 million in kickbacks to clinch a 14 billion contract 
with the gandhi government 
the funds will be restored to the nation and the guilty 
punished he declared at the news conference and pledged to 
restore indias national dignity 
when the bofors contract was signed in 1986 singh was gandhis 
defense minister he later resigned because of what he called 
official reluctance to investigate newspaper allegations that 
powerful indians took payoffs 
gandhi repeatedly has denied profiting from the deal personally 
or that indians received payoffs or commissions but the 
allegations have dogged him for 2 years 
the opposition alliance seeks a broad base ranging from 
communists to rightwing hindu religious groups singh president 
of the peoples party and a secular centrist has the task of 
maintaining unity in such a coalition 
no reliable poll has been taken in two months but the consensus 
of analysts and observers is that gandhi and the congress party 
face a tough challenge if the opposition hangs together 
in its manifesto the national front also says it will 
streamline a labyrinthine bureaucracy that predates independence 
from britain in 1947 
it pledges to establish a national security council under the 
prime minister to help evolve a consensus on our foreign and 
defense policies which the opposition claims are pursued in an 
irrational and arbitrary manner by the present government 
indias armed forces number 14 million fourth largest in the 
world after the superpowers and china it has tested nuclear 
devices has an expanding deepwater navy and is one of only seven 
nations with demonstrated ability to develop and fire 
intermediaterange ballistic missiles 
singhs opposition promised to be convincingly 
peaceoriented and take a total view of defense rather than a 
fractured servicebyservice approach which is the case at 
present 
foreign policy essentials are the same as gandhis the 
opposition platform cited the importance of remaining nonaligned 
and strenghtening friendly relations with both the soviet union and 
united states

the saudi foreign minister returned to 
this resort town friday after talks in syria aimed at resolving the 
lebanese crisis and sources said he received encouraging responses 
that may break the deadlock 
foreign minister prince saud alfaisal began a series of 
meetings with lebanese parliamentarians who for three weeks have 
been discussing their countrys future 
the parliamentary talks have been stalemated by lebanese 
christian leaders demands that syria withdraw its troops from 
lebanon before lebanese moslems are given a greater share of 
political power 
syria has 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
mandate to end the civil war lebanons christian leader gen 
michel aoun said the syrians abrogated the mandate by siding with 
the moslems in the war and he has vowed to drive them out 
sources at the taif conference speaking on condition of 
anonymity said saud was carrying positive replies from syria 
that may break the deadlock in the search for a plan to end the 
14yearold war 
before leaving the syrian capital the foreign minister said 
everybody is keen to ensure the success of the taif meeting 
he said cooperation with syria on the mission was strong but he 
would not go into details 
a mediating committee of saudi arabia morocco and algeria has 
visualized a maximum twoyear phased withdrawal of the syrians from 
beirut and its environs 
according to a draft charter the syrian troops would be 
redeployed in lebanons eastern bekaa valley for an indefinite 
period until a strong central government was established in beirut 
and a security pact signed with damascus 
aoun rejected the indefinite stay and insisted the syrian 
withdrawal start as soon a draft charter for national 
reconciliation is ratified by a formal parliamentary session in 
beirut 
among the ideas circulated in taif according to conference 
sources is that a token syrian pullout be completed before the 
parliamentary session to approve political reforms and elect a 
president 
a security zone would be set up around the parliament 
building in beirut and probably would be policed by algerian 
troops the sources said to ensure that all arrived safely for the 
session 
aoun said in newspaper interviews published friday that the 
parliamentary deputies should come home 
i believe that this tough experience in taif has convinced 
them once and for all that negotiations should not be conducted 
under occupation and no reforms can be achieved under occupation 
he said

a former sperry corp marketing executive 
admitted in court friday that he initiated a bribery scheme in 
which a navy official was paid 400000 to help the company compete 
for a lucrative electronics contract 
frank j lavelle 68 who was marketing director at the 
companys clearwater fla facility faces a possible 20year 
prison sentence for participating in the scheme that included other 
officials of sperry which became part of unisys corp following a 
1986 merger with burroughs corp 
lavelle entered his guilty plea in us district court on a day 
that dennis mitchell a former unisys marketing executive was 
sentenced to a 90day term in a halfway house for arranging 4000 
worth of illegal corporate campaign donations to several 
congressmen 
the guilty plea was the latest in a series of more than 20 
convictions of defense consultants corporate executives and 
pentagon employees stemming from the justice departments 
investigation of defense procurement fraud nicknamed operation 
ill wind 
lavelle admitted that he introduced garland l tomlin jr a 
former navy procurement official to sperry vicepresident charles 
f gardner saying that tomlin wanted a nest egg for his 
eventual retirement from the government 
tomlin 59 already has pleaded guilty to receiving 400000 
from sperry in 1983 and 1984 and 75000 from honeywell inc in 
exchange for bid information on a multimilliondollar maintenance 
contract on the electronic components of navy weapons 
sperry was eliminated from competition for the contract even 
though tomlin wrote reports favoring the companys proposal and 
promoted the bid with other navy officials 
gardner 59 who was vice president in charge of sperrys 
surveillance and fire control systems unit in great neck ny was 
sentenced sept 15 to 32 months in federal prison for his role in a 
separate bribery scheme 
according to court papers gardner obtained permission from an 
unidentified sperry official before approving the payments to 
tomlin which were funneled by defense consultant james g neal to 
an offshore bank account tomlin kept in the bahamas 
neal 65 who has been described by prosecutors as the banker 
for mr gardner and mr gardners operation has received a 
27month prison term for his role in the bribery scheme

for jan 12 1990 
the judge meanwhile ordered mitchell to perform 100 hours of 
community service after serving a 90day term in a halfway house 
mitchell admitted arranging at gardners behest the payment of 
4000 in illegal corporate campaign contributions to various house 
members who had influence over defense issues they included rep 
les aspin the wisconsin democrat who chairs the house 
appropriations committee 
there was no evidence that the lawmakers knew they were 
receiving illegal contributions which were made in the names of 
defense consultants hired by unisys 
mitchell who could have received a 10year prison term told 
hilton i am sorry for my deeds and i am ready to face up to it 
here 
while acknowledging mitchells cooperation with the justice 
departments continuing investigation prosecutor lee j radek said 
his crime was a very serious offense that goes to the heart 
of the electoral process

the bush administration appeared friday to be 
at a critical point in its drive to open mideast peace talks as 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir appealed for us help in 
drawing palestinian arabs into negotiations 
a senior us official said secretary of state james a baker 
iii might soon decide to turn his attention to other foreign policy 
issues but diplomatic sources questioned the notion that baker was 
reaching a deadend 
you have a dialogue at the very highest level it is very 
substantial they are discussing substantial ideas that might lead 
to a breakthrough said the sources who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
shamir in a letter to baker delivered on wednesday urged the 
administration to help overcome intimidation keeping 
palestinians on the west bank and gaza from participating in the 
prime ministers proposal for elections the sources said 
shamir also asked baker to try to enlist moderate arab 
governments such as morocco and jordan to join with egypt in 
trying to implement the elections proposal the sources said 
baker followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with 
shamir thursday evening and with israeli foreign minister moshe 
arens on friday morning but the details were not disclosed as 
baker took off for a long weekend at his ranch in wyoming 
before he left a senior us official said baker was not 
going to pursue this from here to eternity also the official 
told reporters after demanding anonymity baker was giving the 
problem 100 percent but there could be a limit to how long you 
continue 
among the main roadblocks are rejection of the election proposal 
by the palestine liberation organizations central council and 
shamirs insistence that plo members not participate in talks with 
israel 
the state department after accusing shamir of hindering the 
process with unhelpful and disappointing remarks offered 
assurances thursday it was not trying to pressure israel into 
talking to the plo which in its covenant is committed to 
dismantling the jewish state 
shamir meanwhile thanked baker in the letter for his efforts 
to implement the election proposal which is designed to produce 
limited selfrule for palestinians on the west bank and gaza and 
negotiations five years later on an overall settlement 
the letter was not made public but the diplomatic sources 
dislosed shamir elaborated in it on his refusal to negotiate with 
the plo and on his election proposal and urged baker to saek 
support for egypt from modertate arab countries 
also the sources said shamir asked the bush administration to 
discuss the election plan with palestinian leaders on the west bank 
and in gaza who are more likely than the plo to respond favorably 
after all shamir reasoned the palestinians in the territories 
are the ones who would vote negotiate and ultimately live under 
the arrangement worked out with israel 
the prime minister stressed the point local palestinians need 
bolstering so they will not be afraid to stand up to 
intimidation the sources said adding this is very 
highprofile intimate diplomacy they may come to an agreement

parliament voted friday to rehabilitate 
victims of political trials in the stalinist era and to disband the 
armed guard created to protect the communist party after a 1956 
revolt 
the decision to dissolve the workers militia the communist 
partys private army came less than two weeks after the party 
renamed itself the socialist party and committed itself to 
pluralism and democratic ideals 
the socialist party whose leadership is largely comprised of 
the same people who led the communist party had backed a proposal 
to disarm the 60000member force but keep it as a civil defense 
organization 
the socialist party remains in power at least until 
parliamentary elections due early next year they are to be the 
first freely contested national elections since the communists 
consolidated power in 1948 
the existence of the workers militia is no longer 
justified declared justice ministry state secretary gyula borics 
in introducing the legislation 
on the last day of the session the house adopted two bills 
exonerating victims of political trials and other reprisals one 
bill rehabilitated all those convicted of revolutionary activity 
after 1956 and pledged unspecified compensation to victims of 
reprisals 
earlier this year the government had already rehabilitated imre 
nagy the leader of the 1956 uprising and several of his close 
associates 
a second bill also formally rehabilitated those victimized 
between 1948 and 1962 the period now officially considered 
hungarys stalinist period 
the house also overwhelmingly approved a proposal to declare 
oct 23 the day the 1956 antisoviet uprising began as a day of 
national reconciliation however the house rejected a motion 
favored by the opposition that it be made a national holiday 
tens of thousands are expected to rally in front of parliament 
monday to mark the 33rd anniversary of the start of the 1956 
revolt it will be the first time such a public rally is permitted 
in a statement issued friday the socialist party presidium said 
it rejects the soviet invasion that crushed the revolt and 
opposed all forms of intervention or interference in a countrys 
sovereignty 
reforms enacted in the past year have put hungary at the 
forefront of democratic change in eastern europe along with poland 
the only country in the soviet bloc with a noncommunistled 
government 
this weeks session of parliament was dedicated to enacting 
legislation designed to create the legal framework for next years 
multiparty elections 
earlier in the day the body adopted an electoral law envisaging 
a modified system of proportional representation 
it also adopted a bill outlining procedures for electing a 
national president but postponed a decision on when he would be 
chosen the socialist party and most of the major opposition groups 
had tentatively agreed on nov 26 as the date for a direct 
election with subsequent presidents appointed by parliament 
but some opposition groups fearing the short campaign period 
would give the socialist party candidate an unfair advantage have 
collected nearly 200000 signatures calling for a referendum on the 
issue a minimum of 100000 signatures is required to force a 
plebiscite this issue is to be discussed when parliament resumes 
oct 30 
on thursday the house passed legislation permitting opposition 
parties to field candidates in the elections 
the legislature also voted overhwelmingly to ban parties from 
the workplace defeating an alternative proposal backed by the 
socialist party to allow party activity there politicization of 
the workplace has been a key element of communist indoctrination

francisco where he met with city officials the base on the shore 
of san francisco bay is adjacent to the heavily damaged marina 
district 
bush announced he was appointing skinner to coordinate federal 
relief efforts 
the president confessed he had had some second thoughts about 
visiting the quake area not wanting to get in the way but he 
said he concluded if you dont go why its neglect 
bush also taped a television public service announcement here 
seeking to reassure the quakeweary bay area that help was on the 
way 
agnos one of three mayors accompanying the president on his 
tour told bush we need fast action we need checks written on 
the spot 
weve got to work with each other bush told the local 
officials 
skinner would not say how much money was in the package but 
claimed it will be substantial 
these first 90 days virtually all of emergency expenses 
would be covered i assume by the federal government skinner 
said 
he said cleanup and repair were primarily a california 
effort but the federal government would help in any way it could 
from oakland he flew across the bay to san francisco to tour the 
heavily damaged marina area 
bush was greeted at moffett field by sen pete wilson rcalif 
gov george deukmejian and rep norman mineta a democrat who 
represents the southern san francisco bay area 
democrats have pledged at least 25 billion in federal funds to 
assist quake victims but skinner said i dont think the 25 
billion will have a degree of preciseness attached to it 
he said i dont think anybody can tell you at this moment 
exactly how much is going to be needed 
bushs trip on the heels of the tour by quayle and skinner is 
part of swift administration action in the wake of complaints that 
the federal government responded too slowly after hurricane hugo 
struck the caribbean and southeastern united states bush went to 
south carolina following the hurricane to assess damage there 
i will be going out there tomorrow to take a look and to 
provide encouragement to people bush said thursday as 
congressional leaders vowed to increase disaster aid for victims of 
the quake that has wreaked more than 2 billion in damage 
house speaker tom foley on thursday estimated at least 25 
billion in federal funds would be needed to pay for the quake 
assistance he said the house would vote to provide it in a stopgap 
money bill that comes up tuesday 
he vowed to come up with the funds but said he did not know 
where the money would come from 
agnos a democrat had complained that quayle did not visit him 
during his tour of the region on wednesday agnos accused quayle of 
a publicity stunt 
fitzwater said agnos was invited to quayles two meetings with 
local officials and was offered helicopter transportation to attend 
them but rejected the offers 
the white house said an initial 273 million will be available 
for the area from a pool of 11 billion that congress appropriated 
after the devastation caused by hurricane hugo

more than 10000 prodemocracy supporters staged a 
rally in an east german city opposition leaders said friday in 
the latest sign that activists will keep up the pressure on the 
countrys new leader 
members of the outlawed prodemocracy group new forum said the 
rally was held in three churches in the city of zittau thursday 
night and thousands also gathered on the citys market square 
loudspeakers were set up so the crowd outside could hear a 
debate on reform going on in one of the churches said andreas 
schoenfelder a new forum member in zittau 
communist east germany made its first open appeal to the tens of 
thousands of citizens who have fled west in recent months to return 
home 
foreign ministry spokesman wolfang meyer said east berlins 
diplomatic missions would help east germans return as quickly as 
possible 
we want to help anyone unless there are reasons to prevent 
it to come back home meyer said 
more than 55000 east germans have fled to west germany since 
july 
staterun media friday continued to report critically on 
economic and political problems 
the communist party daily neues deutschland devoted four pages 
to the debate on how to solve the nations problems by improving 
socialism 
our communist party is proving that it has the courage to 
face the truth the newspaper said in a commentary the party 
has renounced windowdressing and its presumptuousness 
a west german official meanwhile rejected conditions set by 
east germanys new leader egon krenz for the possible loosening 
of travel for east germans to the west 
krenz said thursday a new law would be drafted to expand travel 
rights but he made it clear that substantial economic and 
political hurdles stood in the way of letting everyone travel west 
many east germans say lack of travel freedoms is one of the 
worst hardships of the tightly controlled society it has been one 
of the main causes of the exodus of tens of thousands of east 
germans this year to the west 
krenz said the government is drafting a new law that could 
ultimately ease travel abroad including to the west and allow all 
east germans to possess a passport but he said the biggest 
obstacle to freer travel to the west is bonns germanys refusal to 
recognize east german citizenship 
east german leaders say economic problems also pose considerable 
obstacles because east germans need west german currency for the 
visits 
east germans cannot now go to a bank and exchange east german 
marks for west german ones 
dorothee wilms who heads west germanys ministry for 
intergerman relations said friday that bonn will not change its 
position on the east german citizenship issue and said east berlin 
already receives millions in hard currency from west germany 
wilms in an interview with west germanys zdf television said 
east germany gets the hard currency through compulsory currency 
exchange from west german tourists and that bonn pays more than 
270 million a year in connection with transit route agreements 
alone 
if east german officials really want to allow their citizens 
free travel to the west then they should use some of this money 
wilms said 
earlier friday wolfgang lueder a member of west german 
chancellor helmut kohls ruling coalition said bonn should not 
allow east berlins apparent readiness to expand travel to the west 
to fail because of money 
lueder was quoted in colognes express newspaper as saying bonn 
should allow east germans to change money at a onetoone ratio 
east german currency is not convertible to western currency 
east german tourists would be really helped if they could 
change between 300 and 500 east german marks for the same sum in 
west german marks 162 to 270 lueder was quoted as saying 
the west german masscirculation bild newspaper reported krenz 
and other top communist leaders met to discuss the refugee problem 
that has seriously strained the nations economy 
bild said the discussion centered on whether to simply let all 
those who are disenchanted with the system to leave the country in 
order to maintain total communist party control 
the newspaper quoted on official as saying that could be 10 
million it said another official responded so what sweden is 
a prosperous land and only has 6 million 
east germany has a population of about 166 million 
in austria officials said friday about 900 east germans had 
crossed from hungary to austria en route to west germany in the 
last 24 hours 
border guards said the crossings brought to 40600 the number of 
east germans who have crossed into austria since hungary opened its 
border for the east germans sept 11 
also friday east germanys staterun adn news agency reported 
the soviet monthy magazine sputnik will be allowed back into the 
country after being banned for nearly a year 
the magazine was banned after it published several articles 
critical of soviet leader josef stalin and questioning the actions 
of german communists before the outbreak of world war ii 
krenz took over wednesday from erich honecker who ruled east 
germany for 18 years

the state department accused nicaragua on 
friday of systematically violating central american peace 
agreements by continuing clandestine efforts to send military 
equipment to leftist rebels in el salvador 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler made the accusation 
after honduran security forces found large amounts of weapons which 
she claimed originated in nicaragua and were earmarked for the 
salvadoran insurgents known by the spanish initials fmln 
the seizure occurred at a border crossing between nicaragua and 
honduras and according to ms tutwiler included ak47s rifle 
grenades explosives thousands of rounds of ammunition and fmln 
instruction manuals 
honduran officials are currently evaluating the facts involved 
in their seizure she said 
there is no doubt however that nicaragua regularly 
systematically and continually aids arms and trains the fmln 
guerrillas nicaragua thereby remains the principal violator of the 
central american peace agreement the spokeswoman said 
tutwiler said the command and control of the fmln continues to 
operate from nicaragua in violation of two agreements signed by 
five central american presidents including nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega 
she added that nicaragua in direct contradiction of its 
claims has continued to send large quantities of weapons to the 
fmln in the 20 months that have passed since american aid to the 
nicaraguan contras was suspended 
honduran military officials have said that the weapons found 
wednesday morning were hidden behind false walls in a truck that 
was carrying furniture from nicaragua to an undetermined location 
in el salvador 
the seizure was said to have been the largest ever involving a 
nicaraguan shipment but no dollar figures were available

an irishman who was exonerated in an ira bombing 
after spending 14 years in jail was freed on bail friday pending 
his appeal of a separate murder conviction 
paul hill was the last of the guildford four defendants to 
be released 
the four were serving life sentences for two ira bombings that 
killed five people in 1974 in guildford southwest of london a 
london judge overturned the convictions thursday ruling that 
police probably lied to get them 
the government immediately ordered an inquiry into police 
actions 
hill 35 was also serving a life sentence for the murder of a 
british soldier he was freed on 6500 bail and emerged from the 
court to cheers from friends and relatives including his 
14yearold daughter cara 
i am very happy he told a reporter how do you think i 
feel after 14 years of hell he was flown to belfast to begin his 
appeal of the murder conviction 
in the ruling thursday lord lane the lord chief justice said 
police officers involved in the investigations that led to the 
bombing convictions must have lied 
the convictions were upheld in 1977 even though irish republican 
army members made detailed confessions in the case 
david williams deputy chief constable of the surrey county 
police force whose officers handled the original investigation of 
the guildford four said three officers had been suspended pending 
an inquiry 
he identified them as a sergeant and two constables he said a 
fourth officer involved a detective inspector had died and a 
fifth a detective chief inspector had retired 
in addition to hill the appeals court threw out the convictions 
of gerard conlon 35 and patrick armstrong 39 of belfast and 
carole richardson 32 of london in the bombing of two pubs at 
guildford on oct 5 1974 
it also overturned convictions of armstrong and hill in a pub 
bombing in the london suburb of woolwich on nov 6 1974 two 
people died in that attack 
irish prime minister charles haughey said thursday he was 
satisfied the system has the capacity to correct its own 
mistakes in the guildford case but he said he also believes six 
irishmen convicted in ira bombings in birmingham england were 
wrongly convicted 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for 
police rejected calls to reopen the case of the socalled 
birmingham six who were convicted of bombing nov 21 1974 the 
attacks killed 21 people 
hurd told the bbc the case of the birmingham six had been 
examined in the same way as the case of the guildford four and 
with no new evidence emerging the convictions were sound 
in court thursday prosecutor roy amlot disclosed evidence that 
five officers in the guildford case altered documents withheld 
evidence and seriously misled the court 
at their 1975 trial the guildford four retracted their 
socalled confessions which they said police had beaten out of 
them 
hurd said the inquiry into police misconduct also will examine 
the conviction of the socalled maguire seven on explosives 
charges the defendants include the late father of conlon one of 
the guildford four 
a cartoon friday in the independent showed hurd staggering from 
a bombwrecked building labeled criminal justice system 
the liberal london newspaper the guardian called the incident 
a story filled with shame

americans who do business with panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega or any of the more than 30 firms in which he 
has an interest could face jail terms and 500000 fines under new 
sanctions being imposed by the bush administration us officials 
said friday 
many of the firms are used as intermediaries for trade between 
the united states and cuba which has been illegal since 1960 the 
officials said 
the move is designed as a deterrent to cuban efforts to 
circumvent the trade embargo while damaging noriegas business 
interests according to the officials who asked not to be 
identified 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler had no comment on 
the measure which was first reported in fridays editions of the 
los angeles times a formal announcement is expected next week 
the administration has been groping for ways to force noriega 
from power but has been reluctant to utilize extreme measures such 
as a trade embargo out of concern that hundreds of american firms 
in panama would go bankrupt in addition the harm inflicted on the 
panamanian economy would take years to overcome 
the new sanction is narrowly targeted at noriega and his 
business partners and is not expected to do major damage to the 
economy as a whole 
it is not clear how extensive the business dealings are that 
americans have with the firms linked to noriega cuba has found 
these firms useful importing through them high technology 
usmade items which otherwise would be beyond cubas reach 
because of the trade embargo 
the firms also have served as conduits for illegal cuban exports 
to the united states the officials said 
the administration had begun examining ways to bring new 
pressure to bear on noriega well before the abortive coup attempt 
on oct 3 
one move being considered is barring panamanianflag vessels 
from us ports another is the withholding by us agencies of 
certain taxes they pay to the panamanian government on behalf of 
their panamanian employees 
spanish prime minister felipe gonzalez ended a twoday visit to 
washington on friday with praise for the restraint president bush 
showed in not committing panamabased us forces to the assistance 
of the rebel officers who tried to overthrow noriega earlier this 
month 
interventionism is never desirable gonzalez said through a 
translator im very pleased to know that it has not happened 
gonzalez has offered some ideas for resolving panamas crisis 
but he acknowledged that a solution cannot be achieved by third 
countries 
it should be a panamanian solution otherwise there will be no 
solution he said 
gonzalez has called for new elections in panama and for the 
newly elected leadership to have the authority to name a new 
defense force commander to replace noriega 
noriega would be allowed to remain in panama and thus would 
remain out of the reach of us law enforcement authorities 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drug trafficking charges 
gonzalez believes that a solution to panamas crisis would be 
eased if less attention is devoted to noriegas personal fate and 
more toward achieving the democratic rule blocked by noriegas 
theft of an election earlier this year

typewriters clattered in newsrooms again 
this week as newspapers around northern california scrambled to 
publish after the earthquake darkened computer screens and silenced 
presses 
when the quake struck newspapers from monterey to san francisco 
were forced to improvise to publish special editions at times 
resorting to writing by longhand in the flickering light of candles 
the sound of the old manual typewriter was heard in the 
newsroom for the first time in a million years said reg henry 
editor of the herald of monterey 
the herald without power was able to publish an earthquake 
special edition that hit monterey streets wednesday night by 
arranging to print at a weekly papers plant in king city 50 miles 
to the south 
a team was sent to king city to produce the 12page special 
edition reporters wrote by hand and typewriter with candles 
burning at their sides 
i was very proud of what we did said henry it was a 
very very trying experience 
mike wallace editor of the watsonville registerpajaronian 
said friday that in the first hours following the quake he couldnt 
reach his reporters because phone lines were out in the area which 
was close to the epicenter 
at daybreak reporters spread across their territory then 
returned to the powerless office to write on batterypowered laptop 
computers in sunlight from the front window 
wallace made arrangements to print at the registers sister 
paper the telegramtribune 160 miles south in san luis obispo 
the laptop stories were sent over phone lines to laptops at the 
telegramtribune then transferred to that papers main computer 
and edited 
a private plane flew the newspapers to watsonville where they 
reached the streets just after 6 pm wednesday 
the long arduous process was worth it wallace said 
because readers were hungry for news more than 15000 copies of 
the eightpage edition without ads were quickly snapped up 
the registerpajaronian was nearly back to normal and produced a 
24page edition friday he said 
we had a hairy day on wednesday but rule no 1 in this 
business is you always publish said wallace 
in san francisco the chronicle used generators to put out 
wednesday mornings eightpage edition produced on apple macintosh 
computers the afternoon examiner also used generators flashlights 
and macintoshes to get out the news 
both published full editions friday with most of their regular 
sections 
tossing aside traditional rivalry the san jose mercury news 
helped the santa cruz sentinel publish a 12page special edition by 
8 pm wednesday 
the sentinel a morning paper sent editors and darkroom and 
composing workers 25 miles to san jose for the editions published 
wednesday through friday evenings 
the sentinel hoped to resume morning editions by sunday 
editor bruce mcpherson praised the mercury news for its 
cooperation 
were impressed they were really great they were really 
helpful said mcpherson they were a class operation 
some newspapers were lucky such as the oakland tribune 
leroy aarons senior vice president for news said the tribune 
survived the quake with its electricity intact the computers were 
quickly revived 
the morning tribune was able to put out a complete edition on 
schedule said aarons the paper printed 206000 papers some 
60000 more than normal 
the mercury news also came out on time printing 100000 extra 
copies the morning after the quake

alcee l hastings removed on friday from his 
federal judgeship can run for governor of florida if he chooses 
but he cant run for the united states senate or the house of 
representatives 
the constitution says so 
hastings announced immediately after his conviction by the 
senate on eight articles of impeachment that he would run for 
governor of his state 
the constitution specifies that conviction by the senate 
includes disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor 
trust or profit under the united states that refers to federal 
not state office 
the impeachment clause of the constitution gives the house of 
representatives the sole power of impeachment to bring 
charges against a president vice president and all civil 
officers of the united states the power to try the individuals 
on these charges is given to the senate 
it is the only means by which federal judges who hold their 
office for life can be removed from the bench 
the word impeach means to accuse the house votes to impeach 
when it adopts articles of impeachment the senate then conducts a 
trial on these issues and if the accused is convicted he is said 
to have been impeached 
hastings was convicted of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a 
150000 payoff 
he is the sixth official removed from office after trial only 
one president andrew johnson has ever been tried by the senate 
and he escaped conviction by one vote 
in richard nixons case the house judiciary committee voted 
three articles of impeachment against nixon but the president 
resigned before the matter could be brought before the full house 
nixon stepped down after he was told by senate leaders that his 
conviction in any trial was certain

lawyers can use evidence about bus safety 
to fight the 27 murder charges their client faces from last years 
buscrash disaster a judge ruled friday 
but the prosecution can use results of blood alcohol tests to 
prove larry mahoney was drunk when he rammed his pickup into the 
bus carrying a church youth group carroll circuit judge charles 
satterwhite said 
satterwhite also ruled that photographs of the victims can be 
used by the prosecution to illustrate a large bus seating chart 
but that the jury cannot be shown pictures of the victims burned 
bodies 
mahoney 36 is charged in the deaths of three adults and 24 
children and teenagers who were killed in the may 14 1988 crash 
one of the nations worst bus disasters his trial is to begin nov 
8 
police said mahoney was driving in the wrong direction on 
interstate 71 southwest of carrollton when his truck collided with 
the bus which burst into flames one adult and 39 youths escaped 
some with severe injuries 
mahoneys attorneys had made clear their intention to base his 
defense on the condition of the bus a school bus bought as 
surplus by radcliff first assembly of god church 
special prosecutor paul richwalsky opposed that but the judge 
sided with the defense team he also rejected the defenses attempt 
to bar the use of multiple bloodalcohol tests conducted on mahoney 
within hours of the crash 
mahoneys lawyers had argued that blood samples were illegally 
obtained and that test results were unreliable 
observers of the case have said mahoneys sole hope at trial may 
be in trying to show that safety defects not his wayward driving 
were ultimately responsible for the deaths 
the national transportation safety board concluded that the 
probable cause of the accident was mahoneys alcoholimpaired 
condition but it added that contributing to the accidents 
severity was the puncturing of the bus fuel tank and the resulting 
fire as well as its flammable seat cushions and bench seats that 
partly blocked the rear emergency door 
the kentucky medical examiner found that all 27 deaths were due 
to smoke inhalation and that no one on board was seriously injured 
by the crash impact

who needs the national weather service 
with rosemary kilduff around to keep an eye on woolly worms 
the beattyville woman friday predicted in an annual survey that 
winter in central appalachia will have an early kick and a late 
bite because the fuzzy caterpillars were mostly black on the ends 
and brown in the middle 
this is the eighth year mrs kilduff has conducted her woolly 
worm survey also taking into account other appalachian folk signs 
to make her winter predictions 
about 250 people called mrs kilduff during the fourweek survey 
to report 1423 woolly worms were black on the ends and brown in 
the middle 52 were solid black 82 were light colored and 11 were 
white she said 
in addition there were 25 local foggy mornings in august three 
hornets nests seen very low to the ground and three persimmon 
seeds with spoonlike structures in the middle 
so we would predict from the woolly worms that our winters 
would be cold on each end and mild in the middle and that it will 
snow but that the snow wont lay on because the hornets nests are 
close to the ground mrs kilduff said 
the height of the hornets nests indicate the height of snow 
the higher the nests the deeper the snow mrs kilduff said the 
shape of the persimmon seeds generally indicate snow and the color 
of the woolly worms predicts the severity of winter she said 
august fog tells her how many snowy days winter will have 
mrs kilduff said her forecasts are remarkably accurate 
last year she predicted a milder than usual winter that proved to 
be true said national weather service forecaster gil russell 
radio stations in new york city minneapolis and chicago called 
mrs kilduff this week to discuss her predictions national 
geographic magazine sent a photographer and writer to cover this 
weekends woolly worm festival that will include a woolly worm race

there was an empty seat in president bushs 
motorcade when it pulled out of the white house gates long before 
dawn friday the presidents press secretary marlin fitzwater was 
missing 
no one seemingly noticed fitzwaters absence as bush rode 
through an earlymorning rain to andrews air force base to catch 
air force one to fly to northern california to inspect earthquake 
damage 
yet puzzled flight attendants on bushs plane noted that 
fitzwater who virtually always accompanies the president was 
listed on the manifest for the flight and they inquired about his 
whereabouts 
when he didnt show up his seat was given to a magazine 
reporter who was stranded at andrews after missing an earlier 
flight to california on a plane chartered by the press corps 
accompanying the president 
white house press aides who had flown ahead on the earlier press 
charter were baffled when their boss didnt get off air force one 
with the president at moffett naval air station near san jose 
calif 
the mystery was solved back in washington 
fitzwater had missed the motorcades departure at 531 am he 
said he had been working in his office and no one alerted him that 
the motorcade was about to pull out 
when he went out in the rain to join the motorcade fitzwater 
was told it had left a minute or so earlier he spent the rest of 
the day working at the white house

washington the senate on friday convicted us district judge 
alcee l hastings of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a 150000 
payoff making him the sixth federal official in the natons 
history removed from office by impeachment 
i have no choice but to accept their judgment said 
hastings pausing in a drizzle on the senate steps as he left the 
chamber he maintained his innocence called the trial unfair 
pledged to run for governor of florida and said he would resume the 
practice of law 
hastings 53 floridas first black federal district judge was 
acquitted of the briberyconspiracy charges in a criminal trial six 
years ago 
the senate sealed his fate when it voted 6926 to convict him on 
the first of 17 articles of impeachment charging him with 
conspiracy to obtain a bribe 
in two hours of backtoback roll calls the senate found him 
guilty on eight of the articles acquitted him on three and waived 
action on six 
senate president pro tempore robert byrd dwva announced the 
results and declared that it is therefore ordered that the said 
alcee l hastings be and is hereby removed from the office for 
which he was paid 89500 
his ouster followed by three years a similar action against 
judge harry e claiborne of nevada the fifth official ever removed 
in an impeachment case the senate is nearing final action on 
impeachment charges against judge walter nixon of mississippi 
hastings left the senate a free man facing no prison sentence 
and with no criminal acquitted on his record 
the impeachment trial was not designed to reverse the verdict of 
the jury that acquitted him in 1983 but to remove him from the 
bench 
for that reason his accusers scoffed at hastings frequent 
complaint that he was a victim of double jeopardy because he 
had already been acquitted n court of the same charges 
do you then not take the matter up and then let a judge serve 
who you know is guilty of bribery rep john bryant dtexas 
told a news conference following the senates action the articles 
of impeachment had been prepared by the house 
this isnt a case of double jeopardy said sen bob graham 
dfla he said that was so because we are sitting in a separate 
forum with separate standards of proof 
but he voted to acquit hastings on all articles of impeachment 
the evidence presented was not clear and convincing graham 
said 
hastings watched at a table on the senate floor throughout the 
first roll call while defense attorney terence j anderson kept a 
tally anderson showed the results to hastings before they were 
announced and they shook hands 
a moment later defense attorney patricia williams a longtime 
hastings friend left the chamber she was soon followed by 
hastings and anderson 
im upbeat and can go forward with my life he told 
reporters there are those of you who would say i should be 
banished in infamy i know nothing in my life that requires that 
hastings was accused of plotting with william borders once a 
prominent washington attorney to obtain a bribe from two brothers 
frank and tom romano who each were facing threeyear fraud 
sentences imposed by hastings 
borders was arrested oct 9 1981 while driving from a suburban 
virginia motel with an fbi undercover agent posing as frank romano 
and a garment bag containing 125000 in cash 
hastings in washington for a testimonial dinner in honor of 
borders that night was told that the fbi wanted to question him 
but instead quickly returned to miami by an indirect route without 
checking out of his hotel 
borders later served a prison sentence in the matter and was to 
be released friday from jail where he had been held for contempt 
of court for refusing to testify in the senate impeachment trial 
hastings was acquitted friday of one count of perjury which he 
had been chraged with in telling the jury he had not expected 
borders to appear in a washington hotel room sept 12 1981 his 
accusers said the hotel room meeting was part of the conspircay 
in an anticlimax the senate acquitted him 950 of a charge 
that in an unrelated case he improperly disclosed information 
obtained from a courtauthorized wiretap under his supervision the 
senate also acquitted him of an omnibus or catchall charge that 
he had acted improperly or given the appearance of impropriety 
hastings said that what the senate has said is a standard of 
almost proven innuendo and inference is good enough to remove a 
judge or executive officer by way of impeachment that is chilling 
and fraught with potential to do a lot of harm 
he said he was hopeful that some book offers will come along 
there are so many wonderful and tragic stories that are born 
of this saga they need to be told and tell them i shall

chinatown among the hardesthit 
neighborhoods in san franciscos gigantic 1906 earthquake appeared 
to be one of the luckier ones this time 
i was absolutely surprised that chinatown didnt have serious 
damage tuesday city supervisor tom hsieh said friday but the 
damage could be hidden from the surface 
the teeming neighborhood of narrow streets crowded with 
restaurants food markets and souvenir shops covers about a 
milesquare area near north beach and the financial district it is 
home to about 40000 people 
hsieh said that he plans to introduce legislation at the board 
of supervisors meeting monday which would require thorough 
inspection of unreinforced masonry buildings in the city he 
estimates there are at least 1000 such buildings mostly in 
chinatown and the tenderloin housing about 10000 people 
they were built with bricks in the old days with no 
reinforcement bars inside the bricks were put together with sand 
and some kind of plaster mixture which has no structure capacity 
the buildings somehow survived but between the bricks the 
mortar might be totally deteriorated and if there are additional 
shakes we may see major collapses of these unreinforced 
buildings 
hsieh of chinese ancestry is the citys first supervisor of 
asian background he also is a former architect 
some of the older buildings in chinatown predate the 1906 quake 
the district is one of the most densely populated in san francisco 
it was badly damaged in 1906 but not flattened altogether 
hsieh said 
on tuesday some bricks were shaken off buildings and onto the 
streets and some windows were broken most of the damage was inside 
shops and restaurants whose employees loaded trashcans with the 
remains of glassware china vases and other items 
jimmy wong who served george bush crispy chicken and butterfly 
prawns during last falls presidential campaign was still out of 
business friday because of an empty refrigerator at his empress of 
china restaurant 
we had to throw food out and reorder wong said 
the empress of china opened for dinner at 5 oclock on tuesday 
and the first two customers had just been seated when the 
earthquake hit wong and his employees spent the next day cleaning 
up broken liquor bottles dishes and glasses 
all the bottles at the bar fell and a lot in our storeroom 
were broken but the food lost was more expensive than than the 
liquor wong said i dont have any damage estimate yet 
orlando kuan proprietor of a coffee shop and bakery down the 
street stayed open with the help of candlelight for several hours 
and sold out his supply of pastry 
people were buying everything they didnt know if theyd be 
able to get anything to eat the next day i heard that some places 
charged higher prices after the earthquake we didnt do that 
kuan said i didnt do that 
i was just happy that we were all right and i wanted to help 
people 
kuan did not lose gas service so was able to continue cooking 
pastry wednesday and thursday most of chinatown did not get 
electic power restored until thursday afternoon

a couple who lured consumers to visit 
timeshare resorts with false promises of expensive prizes pleaded 
guilty friday to charges of defrauding creditors of more than 1 
million 
david a defusco 34 and his 28yearold wife annette 
admitted to a bankruptcy fraud conspiracy in guilty pleas that us 
attorney henry hudson said ends the story of a very charmed life 
led by those two individuals 
hudson said the couple used phantom corporations and aliases to 
hide money frozen in bankruptcy proceedings from creditors who 
claim unpaid debts of 25 million from the defuscos and their 
companies 
the couple had every kind of luxury item you could imagine 
including eight mink coats a rolls royce and two mercedesbenz 
automobiles hudson said 
after the trustee ordered liquidation of their assets last 
spring the defuscos sold two cars and moved 250000 worth of 
personal possessions to rancho santa fe calif and opened another 
business under assumed names hudson said 
fbi agents who raided their california home on july 5 found 
jewelry furs a persian rug worth 15000 and art work valued at 
more than 10000 hudson said 
the search also uncovered a wellworn copy of a book entitled 
how to create a new identity that hudson said was the bible 
of the defuscos business operations they became masters of 
deceit 
defusco who pleaded guilty oct 6 in beaumont texas to fraud 
charges stemming from the operation of the couples directmail 
advertising company admitted diverting 1 million worth of 
corporate and personal assets that had been frozen by a us 
bankruptcy trustee 
mrs defusco who was sobbing as she appeared before us 
district judge claude hilton admitted diverting 290000 worth of 
assets as part of the scheme with her husband 
each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison and fined up to 
750000 for guilty pleas to conspiracy to conceal assets from a 
bankruptcy trustee and money laundering defusco also faces a 
possible 10year term for his fraud convictions in texas 
hudson told reporters the defuscos had lived in a 1 million 
house in great falls va with a gardner maid and a nanny they 
often dined twice a week a an expensive french restaurant where the 
bill was 250 
their creditors claim 25 million in unpaid bills including 
60000 for american express creditcard charges to buy jewelry 
hudson said 
the couple mailed millions of pieces of advertising that 
promised prizes ranging from televisions to imported cars to people 
if they drove hundreds of miles to visit timeshare condominium 
resorts prosecutors have said 
in earlier guilty plea defusco admitted conspiring with freedom 
financial corp to lure residents from midwest and southwest states 
to visit timeshare resorts in texas and missouri 
the federal trade commission has filed suit to seek an 
injunction barring the defuscos from continuing the mailings 
defense attorney kent a schaffer disagreed with hudsons 
description of his cleints this isnt a situation where two 
people set to out see how much theycould steal he said 
they are people who have been successful in business for a 
time he said in 1986 they started to have problems of money 
owed to the postal authorities 
they got on a treadmill trying to pay off the 240000 owed 
to the postal service for mailing costs schaffer said 
he accused hudson and robert j wortham the us attorney in 
beaumont texas of competing to see who is going to get the 
first press conference about the case 
as part of the plea agreement federal prosecutors in seattle 
agreed not to press fraud charges stemming from the defuscos 
operation of another marketing company 
the couple also agreed to help investigators trace assets that 
are still missing

art thieves who knew what they wanted picked 
their way through the home of a collector who lost in excess of 
500000 in china a crystal chandelier and 19 impressionist 
paintings by his late father 
the fbi called in after the theft last month termed the 
initial halfmillion dollar loss figure extremely conservative 
among the items lost in the heist was the masterpiece meet at 
white horse an impressionist view of horses and hounds gathering 
for the hunt by charles morris young who left his best works to 
his children 
the art was stolen from the home of youngs son brinton coxe 
young in the nearby community of wayne sometime between sept 7 
and sept 14 
the thieves also packed up 20 paintings by other artists a rare 
waterford crystal chandelier worth as much as 100000 family 
jewelry and silver china antique furniture and oriental rugs 
police said among the family treasures reported missing was a gold 
sealing ring that once belonged to arthur middleton one of the 
signers of the declaration of independence and an ancestor of 
brinton young on his mothers side 
the thieves were wellinformed police said they knew what they 
wanted and were aware that the family was not expected home for 
some time 
for example the burglars searched through a large china cabinet 
but took only a set of original blueandwhite canton plates 
leaving behind some canton copies according to tredyffrin township 
police detective charles myers 
this isnt like stealing a car or a stereo myers said this 
week its a narrow market and art thieves are a narrow and 
esoteric group they are not your normal smashandgrabbers 
the elder young was a student and awardwinning artist at the 
academy of fine arts in philadelphia which owns four of his 
paintings he also studied at colarossi academy in paris and 
enjoyed some international acclaim his paintings won medals and 
were exhibited in shows and gallleries across the united states and 
also in europe and south america 
if charles morris youngs reputation is not widespread it is 
only because so many of his paintings have been lost said charles 
t clark director of development for the florence griswold museum 
in old lyme conn which owns some of youngs work 
a fire in 1962 at the elder youngs home in radnor a posh 
philadelphia suburb known for its fox hunt destroyed 185 of his 
paintings he was able to repaint a few of his best pieces before 
he died two years later at the age of 95 
clark an authority on youngs paintings said that the artist 
was a very skeptical person who did not like to give his work 
to anyone but those closest to him 
theres no reason in the world he could not have had a 
national audience were he more widely exhibited clark said 
fbi agent john h kundts said the original 500000 estimate of 
the loss was an extremely conservative figure an fbi spokesman 
said friday that there were no new developments in the case 
the money doesnt matter said hilda osterhout wife of 
brinton young and close friend and biographer of her late 
fatherinlaw its the fact that the beauty is gone 
she is contacting art galleries publications and organizations 
to alert members of the art community that the paintings have been 
stolen 
were going to get them back osterhout said weve got to 
get them back 
most of the stolen paintings were 20 inches by 24 inches or 30 
inches by 40 inches as is meet at white horse the smallest 
called rose tree hunt is six inches by eight inches

seal 
crawford said that because of the high levels of sulfites found 
during testing sulfitesensitive consumers could become seriously 
ill or even die 
sulfites are not permitted as direct additives in meat or 
poultry because the chemical can mask spoilage he said

vegetables used as ingredients have been treated with the chemical 
at safe levels crawford said to alert consumers the word 
sulfites must be included in the ingredients statement on the 
package

where george washington and benjamin franklin attended services 
runcie was invited to philadelphia by christ church sponsor of 
a conference held since wednesday on the founding of the domestic 
and foreign missionary society of the protestant episcopal church 
in the united states of america in 1789 
during two sessions that summer and fall in philadelphia

committing the anglican and roman catholic churches to heal their

for sensitivity toward those who believe women should not be

legislation enabling california to receive 
extra emergency highway funds for repairing the collapsed bay 
bridge and other federal highways was introduced friday with one 
senator saying he wanted to know why a section of interstate 880 
gave way in tuesdays earthquake 
sen steve symms ridaho introduced the bill which would 
waive the 100 million cap on emergency highway funds for a single 
disaster and allow the money to be used on the bay bridge which 
would normally be ineligible for such emergency relief because it 
is a toll facility 
the emergency highwayaid fund currently has 219 million 
consisting of this years 100 million authorization and a 119 
million carryover from previous years 
highway money also exists in a 10 billion highway trust fund 
financed by user fees and fuel and tire taxes but that money is 
not available for emergency highway aid 
symms is the ranking member and former chairman of the 
environment and public works subcommittee on water resources 
transportation and infrastructure the subcommittee is chaired by 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
moynihan said he would like to hold hearings to ask the 
necessary question why was it that a 60story skyscraper survived 
this event event in california without any damage of any kind and 
twostory highways collapsed 
the interstate system is now in effect completed but we 
also observe that there are portions that fall down more readily 
than they ought that do not withstand the shocks that we can 
obviously provide for he said if we do it in a 60story 
building we can do it a twostory concrete highway we want to 
know about that 
engineers and california officials have said the twolevel 
highway which had been strengthened should have been able to 
withstand the quake

patrolman gary fappianas job these days 
is tracking down reports of people missing and feared dead in the 
rubble of the collapsed cypress overpass on interstate 880 
in the first 2 hours after the quake hit tuesday at 504 pm 
he learned firsthand what its like to fear that a lovedone may 
have been killed in an earthquake 
my wife does travel on that section of the freeway and she 
gets off at 5 fappiana said friday she was two blocks away 
when it came down i was watching a station that didnt have verbal 
communication with the helicopter showing the pictures but i knew 
that was the cyrpess structure that had come down 
i waited 2 hours in front of the tv til she came home 
ten police officers make telephone calls every four hours around 
the clock to those who have made missing persons reports to find 
out if people have turned up 
by friday afternoon a total of 242 people had been reported 
missing in oakland at some point in connection with the earthquake 
said sgt greg hughes who heads the missing persons office of 
those 145 were later located including seven dead whose next of 
kin have been notified 
he said that left 97 missing all of whom had a chance of 
driving on interstate 880 when a milelong section of the 
doubledecker freeway collapsed trapping cars in the rubble other 
police reports have put the number missing as high as 167 
hughes said about 80 of those were reported from the beginning 
and 15 or 20 represent more recent reports 
one of the missing is melissa maxwell a deputy district 
attorney for alameda county 
she left her office located next to the freeway on tuesday 
afternoon for the san francisco airport to pick up some relatives 
and hasnt been heard from since said senior deputy district 
attorney john adams 
they found some cars and one of them looked like hers adams 
said were hoping for the best but who knows 
marc zambetti 27 a sales manager for stella doro biscuit co 
in san leandro is also missing 
he left work at 12 minutes to five on the earthquake day 
heading for the city plant manager dominic clarco told the 
tribune two hours later i started hearing about the cypress 
overpass collapsing 
right now i am on pins and needles waiting to hear he 
said weve just hired somebody who is going to sit in his 
apartment for the next 24 or 48 hours in case someone calls in 
case he calls 
fappiana said that as many as a dozen wrecked cars towed away 
from the freeway had no bodies in them 
its totally amazing said hughes i cant understand it 
unless some people had some prewarning and were able to abandon 
their cars 
we have not had anybody calling us back to say i made it out 
of my car hughes said 
he added that the count has been complicated by the fact that 
some of the dead who have been identified were never reported 
missing 
thats why police are regularly calling everyone who has made a 
report 
its not like an air crash where people are international 
said hughes you have people working stiffs living in the east 
bay or the ity san francisco 
theres a lot of people close to home he said 
danna fabella division director of childrens placement 
services for alameda county has been running a volunteer hotline 
for people asking about loved ones 
she was so busy after the earthquake she never called her 
husband who was on a business trip in puerto rico to let him know 
she was safe 
he called me at 3 in the morning and absolutely cried she 
said i said i was sorry but i knew i was ok i just didnt 
think he would be worried

education secretary lauro cavazos joined 
grayhaired alumni and fifthgraders in pilgrim outfits friday to 
mark the 350th anniversary of the nations oldest free school 
made new for its birthday by an infusion of renovation funds 
cavazos said the refurbishing of mather school where morale had 
sagged as graffiti and other scars multiplied in the past decade 
speaks to the way our nation is getting together to address our 
education deficit 
the school was founded in 1639 as a oneroom boys school with a 
grass roof it flourished moving five times to accommodate its 
growing enrollment but in 1974 federal orders to desegregate 
boston schools through busing contributed to a middleclass exodus 
to the suburbs and the schools condition deteriorated it took a 
new principal and the looming anniversary to get the 12 million 
renovation under way 
friday the new mather was polished and humming equipped with a 
set of gleaming windows a new playground out front to greet the 
visitors and a refurbished auditorium 
i think this shows that when we put the resources there the 
system can work said mayor raymond l flynn who said he hoped 
to do the same for every school in the city 
gov michael s dukakis who over the past year has struggled 
with a state budget shortfall that has forced him to cut back state 
school aid reminded the audience that improvements in schools have 
a price 
taxes tuitions those funds for this school didnt come out 
of the air the governor said weve got to decide just how 
important schools are and the real work has just begun 
to many 600 alumni and others on hand however taxes and 
renovation seemed beside the point as they greeted old friends and 
students they had not seen in decades 
i wouldnt miss this for the world said lola tassinari 
mcgrail who taught french at mather from 1941 to 1953 many of 
my students are here now 
nearby a group of grayhaired men and women in tweed exclaimed 
over a yellowed picture of the class of 1932 pointing out their 
younger selves 
the photographs where white faces stare out in sepia tones 
portrayed another facet of the major changes at mather fifteen 
years after the school was ordered to integrate 80 percent of the 
student body is black and hispanic 
we are now truly a worldwide school said principal michael 
marshall this diversity makes us vibrant and strong but it also 
puts us on the front lines of whats happening in the community 
on stage the students showed the audience how much mather had 
altered four classes of fifth and sixthgraders sat on chairs 
wearing placards with flags from such countries as kenya turkey 
ethiopia and israel to proclaim the lands their ancestors 
inhabited 350 years ago 
one of those attending was rose cosgrove 81 who graduated from 
mather in 1921 and whose daughter eileen keeney teaches remedial 
math there keeney said she came to the school because it had an 
opening but she considered her mothers attendance there a bonus 
its exciting that im in the same school my mother was 
said keeney 44 a few weeks ago i was in a room where all the 
old records were for attendance and such and i looked up her 
records it made me really happy

the state department on friday praised a 
proposal by the sovietled warsaw pact on military inspections in 
europe and said it was close to natos approach 
however at least two major differences over reducing troops and 
weapons surfaced 
the soviets and their six allies called for limits on military 
budgets and a freeze on modernizing military airfields and bases 
us officials said 
speaking on the condition of anonymity they said it was 
practically impossible to make accurate comparisons between 
military spending on the two sides and the officials said nato 
needs to be able to improve its installations 
a current example is altering a base in italy in order to deploy 
f16 jet fighters being transferred from spain 
you dont want to find yourself down the road with your 
physical plants run down an official told the associated press 
the warsaw pacts acceptance of the us idea of permanent 
inspections of military installations including key transit 
points could also cause friction within the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
two key members britain and france are opposed to the concept 
promoted by the united states and now the soviet union which made 
its presentation thursday at negotiations in vienna austria 
the negotiations involving 23 countries are designed to reduce 
troops tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons across 
europe a priority issue is how to verify current levels of troops 
and weapons and then reductions under a treaty president bush has 
predicted will be completed by may 
the president has called for a ceiling of 275000 on us and 
soviet troops in the area nato proposed last summer that the two 
alliances be limited to 20000 tanks 16500 artillery pieces and 
3800 aircraft 
the warsaw pact has not offered a formal response but soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev has indicated on several occasions 
he favored acrosstheboard reductions in the nonnuclear armaments 
deployed on the two sides of the eastwest divide 
the pact called for permanent inspection of military facilities 
including transit points shortnotice random checks that could 
not be blocked and restraints on military exercises 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler reacting to the 
overall warsaw pact position said the east proposals on 
verification appear to be based on the concepts that nato 
presented we are pleased that the warsaw pact approach to 
verification appears to parallel that of nato

an international conference on 
endangered species friday rejected a us proposal to limit export 
of elephant tusks classified as hunting trophies 
the 91nation conference ended its meeting after adding 60 types 
of orchids the salmoncrested cockatoo and the pacific island 
flying fox to the list of species threatened with extinction 
but while the convention on international trade in endangered 
species considered proposals to mark as threatened more than 200 
animals and plants during its meeting its main concern was the 
worlds rapidly declining elephant population 
on monday the convention put the elephant on the endangered 
species list and with that approved a ban on trade in ivory 
on friday it rejected the us proposal to set quotas for the 
tusks a move that would have allowed a maximum 750 elephants to be 
killed every year for sport as opposed to commercial trade purposes 
such a quota would have allowed biggame hunters to take the 
prized tusks home in the absence of international rules federal 
legislation in several countries including the united states will 
outlaw hunting trophies under the conferences ban on ivory trade 
a member of the us delegation said the proposal was designed 
to help wildlife management 
the delegate who spoke on condition of anonymity said many 
countries still will permit the import of hunting trophies and that 
the proposal would have limited the number of elephants killed for 
sport 
botswana delegate mushanana nchunga calling for rejection of 
the us proposal said its strange that the same people who 
have pushed for an ivory ban are saying its ok to hunt elephants 
for sport ok to decorate the house with tusks but not for a 
woman to wear ivory earrings 
the ban on ivory sales goes into effect jan 18 it covers trade 
in elephant tusks skins and meat and all existing stocks of ivory 
most of them in hong kong where asians in particular covet ivory 
however countries can get around the convention rulings by 
filing for exemptions and several southern african countries 
including botswana mozambique malawi and burundi have indicated 
they will do so because they consider their elephant management 
programs a success 
zimbabwe already has formally requested one and south african 
chief delegate pieter mulder said pretoria was swaying toward 
asking for an exemption 
under convention rules this would allow them to sell ivory to 
member countries that also have exemptions and to more than 60 
countries outside the convention 
japan the worlds biggest market for ivory has not said 
whether it will request an exemption 
the conference decided friday to hold its 1992 conference in 
tokyo

the entire military command met 
with journalists friday and declared that a demand by leftist 
rebels for a purge of the armed forces was ridiculous and 
impossible 
rebel leaders contend the commanders are corrupt and implicated 
in human rights abuses 
the unusual gathering of the defense minister air force 
commander chief of the joint chiefs of staff and commanders of all 
brigades and battalions two generals and 35 colonels in all 
reaffirmed a rejection of the idea thursday by president alfredo 
cristiani 
we feel it appropriate to provide a strong clear united 
response to the proposal made by the fmln in costa rica said 
gen humberto larios the defense minister 
he described the rebel demand that he and 16 other top 
commanders be remoed as absurd ridiculous and impossible 
representatives of the rightist government and the farabundo 
marti national liberation front the guerrilla alliance ended 
three days of peace talks wednesday in costa rica no substantive 
accord was reached but they agreed to another meeting next month 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed most of them 
civilians since the civil war began 10 years ago 
in a nationally broadcast address thursday cristiani also 
called the purge demand ridiculous he accused the rebels of 
using the talks tactically in an effort to isolate the 
government and divide the armed forces 
the fmln has not demonstrated the political will to want to 
achieve peace said cristiani it refuses to talk about a 
cessation of hostilities its entire attitude is one of 
provocation 
he said it was totally absurd for the guerrillas to demand 
that any ceasefire agreement recognize their control of territory 
and stipulate that supreme court judges be replaced 
we recognize the fmln is a reality that it exists but it is 
a small reality and cannot oblige the government to change the 
republics constitutional system cristiani said 
guerrilla forces control a swath of northern and eastern el 
salvador and are present to some degree in all 14 provinces 
the rebels say the governments insistence on an immediate 
cessation of hostilities without agreement on eventual reforms is a 
disguised call for surrender

rep john bryant celebrated the senates vote 
friday to oust us district judge alcee l hastings from the bench 
by sipping champagne and eating pizza 
the rewarding feeling i have is that a complicated and 
controversial case ended with justice being done said bryant 
appointed by the house as the chief prosecutor in hastings senate 
trial i feel 100 percent certain that he was guilty and clearly 
should not be serving as a federal judge 
bryant said he expects the former federal judge to campaign 
against him as he seeks the democratic nomination for texas 
attorney general 
hastings the first black us district court judge in florida 
said he would do so during a recent meeting in houston with a 
coalition of black democratic leaders where he also complained he 
was being unfairly prosecuted by bryant the dallas congressman 
said in an interview 
but benjamin l hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said black 
voters should not hold bryants role in the case against him 
hooks said that since all but three members of the congressional 
black caucus voted to impeach hastings its difficult to say 
that because a white man took part he should be singled out 
hooks said one of those congressmen supporting hastings 
impeachment was rep john conyers a detroit democrat who no one 
can say is soft on positions affecting black people 
bryant meanwhile said he feels vindicated by the senates vote 
to convict hastings of perjury and conspiracy to obtain a 150000 
payoff making the miami judge the sixth federal official removed 
as a result of impeachment 
i was not certain what the verdict would be at any stage 
because of the fact that it was a case that involved a previous 
acquital of the judge on one of the central charges bryant said 
of course it also involved a conviction of his coconspirator for 
conspiring with the judge to extort a bribe 
so you had contradictory jury verdicts making the matter 
legally complicated and then you had a very complex set of facts 
requiring the senate to make a decision based on strong but 
circumstantial evidence said bryant a member of the judiciary 
committee 
hastings 53 was acquitted of the briberyconspiracy charges in 
a criminal trial six years ago 
bryant said he feels good about having fulfilled his 
responsibility 
i was asked to take this role by judiciary chairman jack 
brooks of texas and i knew it would be extremely controversial and 
time consuming he said

scientists converged on the santa 
cruz mountains on friday to look for the origins of northern 
californias killer earthquake as mountain residents resumed life 
in the fault zone 
geologists were investigating whether a fissure hundreds of 
yards long and as wide as 20 inches in some spots was in fact the 
result of the san andreas fault rupturing to the surface 
the question were trying to answer is whether that break is 
the primary fault or something else said tom fumal of the us 
geological survey in menlo park 
seismologists believe the infamous faults southern santa cruz 
mountains segment was responsible for tuesdays disastrous 
69magnitude quake but doubts have been raised by their 
difficulty finding where the fault broke through to the surface of 
the ground 
finding the surface trace of the fault is important because it 
would confirm the san andreas indeed caused the quake a 1988 usgs 
report said the faults santa cruz mountains segment had a 30 
percent chance of causing a strong quake within 30 years 
if it turns out that tuesdays quake was caused by some fault 
other than the san andreas that risk likely would remain 
unchanged if the san andreas did cause the quake severe quakes on 
that segment of the fault would be less likely in coming decades 
by friday afternoon state geologists found fissures caused by 
seismic ground settling but they failed to turn up evidence that 
the underground rupture of the san andreas had broken to the 
surface of the ground said max flanery of the california division 
of mines and geology in sacramento 
tuesdays major quake should have caused ground on one side of 
the fault to slip past the ground on the other side by at least 
several inches to a few feet but such offset was found only on 
two cracked roads near the epicenter and it totaled only a couple 
of inches said bob streitz a geologist with the state 
the aftershock zone from tuesdays quake stretches from the 
lexington reservoir south of los gatos southward some 25 miles to 
san juan bautista so the fault could have broken through to the 
surface along that line streitz said 
usgs scientist david schwartz said the actual fault rupture 
causing the quake probably occurred as deep as 12 miles 
underground he said it is possible the breakage might not migrate 
upward or might take weeks to reach the surface some say rupture 
of the san andreas deep underground might cause several smaller 
surface ruptures instead of a single crack in the soft soils at 
surface level 
the search for fissures has been complicated by the remote 
regions thick brush and trees mountainous terrain and difficult 
access 
the crack on which scientists focused friday is about five miles 
from the quakes epicenter the fissure is nearly 17 feet deep at 
one point runs across a twolane mountain road and up linda and 
roger wollesons gravel driveway which they jokingly dubbed 
allstate insurance alley 
the wollesons were not in their secluded home at the time of the 
504 pm earthquake the temblor knocked their home off its 
foundations and flipped their water bed mattress out of its frame 
most of the people up here are pretty sturdy and well try to 
rebuild but to know so many people who have to glue their lives 
together is pretty impressive mrs wolleson said 
the wollesons who have been living in their home shrouded by 
redwoods for 16 years were unaware of any fault beneath their 
property 
you know its very beautiful here wolleson said explaining 
their decision to remain were just hoping the worst part is 
over 
but lucia sutton a longtime resident said my husband is 
absolutely ready to leave this area ive never seen my husband 
shaking like he was and it wasnt because of the problems 
yesterday he was just so mad and he just wanted out

sir anthony quayle the actordirector who built 
stratforduponavon into a center of british theater died friday 
at his home he was 76 
quayle had been suffering from cancer said his agent laurence 
evans 
a versatile classical actor who created a memorable falstaff 
at stratford in 1951 quayle had been in the theater nearly 40 
years before tasting box office success with his role in sleuth 
in london and new york in 1970 
his distinguished film credits included alfred hitchcocks the 
wrong man the guns of navarone lawrence of arabia and 
anne of a thousand days which brought him an academy award 
nomination for his role as cardinal wolsey 
in 1985 quayle joined the distinguished company of 
actorknights that has included laurence olivier alec guinness 
john gielgud ralph richardson john mills and most recently rex 
harrison 
on friday britains finest actors gathered at westminster abbey 
for a memorial service in honor of olivier who died july 11 at 82 
quayle was due to return to the london stage this fall in 
never the sinner a courtroom drama by chicago playwright john 
logan he bowed out prior to rehearsals due to poor health and the 
west end run was indefinitely postponed 
he had stepped down in july as director of compass a touring 
company he founded in 1984 and was succeeded by tim pigottsmith 
gielgud praised quayle as very fair very unbitchy very 
uninterested in gossip and always in a good humor amusing and 
understanding 
he was a dear fellow gielgud said friday night in an 
interview with independent television news 
quayle made his first appearance on the london stage in 1931 
and was a stalwart of the old vic company for several seasons he 
made his american debut in 1936 in the country wife which 
starred ruth gordon 
he made his debut as a director in 1946 in a london production 
of crime and punishment starring gielgud peter ustinov and 
edith evans 
he became director of the shakespeare memorial theater in 
stratford in 1948 appearing that first season as petruchio in 
the taming of the shrew he played falstaff in both parts of 
henry iv in 1951 and in the merry wives of windsor in 1955 
he secured the theaters reputation by luring olivier 
richardson gielgud and other top names to stratford where they 
were paid minimum wages 
you have to set an example a merry example i hope quayle 
said of his time at stratford which continued until 1956 
in the war there was a thing called man management it only 
amounted to a mixture of firmness and sympathy if you treat people 
as if they are doing their best for you then they will do their 
best for you quayle said in an interview this summer with the 
independent newspaper 
yet as a manager or director quayle admitted he sometimes 
believed he had been pouring creativity into others at the 
expense of my own 
quayle said after the stage success of sleuth that he had 
always had to supplement his stage income with work in television 
and films i was in the tarzan films and fall of the roman 
empire and one dreary thing after another he said 
other broadway appearances included bertolt brechts 
galileo ustinovs up the tree in 1967 and christopher 
marlowes tamburlaine the great in 1956 
during world war ii quayle served in the royal artillery and 
spent six months organizing partisan guerrilla forces behind german 
lines in albania 
he is survived by his second wife dorothy an american actress 
he married in 1947 two daughters and a son his first marriage 
ended in divorce 
morton gottlieb one of the producers of sleuth which ran 
for 1222 performances in new york recalled quayle as a 
wonderful actor 
there are some actors who have a certain personality and no 
matter what the role is that personality takes over the stage 
gottlieb said but tony quayle would fit into whatever the role 
and characterization was rather than imposing a certain persona on 
the play and the audience sometimes with big stars that doesnt 
happen

1988 revolt the government news agency telam reported 
president carlos menem must approve the action but he said 
thursday it doesnt matter to me what names are included ill 
sign it

if victims of the san francisco area 
earthquake decide to sue the state for injuries losses or 
relatives deaths caused by the collapse of statebuilt structures 
they face a long and complex process 
state law gives the state design defect immunity that means the 
state cannot be sued because of a basic defect in the design of a 
public works project such as a highway 
that will be an issue in any lawsuits filed relating to the 
collapses of sections of interstate 880 freeway or the bay bridge 
said alan ashby spokesman fir the state attorney general 
victims who believe the state was to blame for their losses 
cant go into court as quickly as if they were suing a private 
person or business 
before you can sue the state you have to file a claim said 
curt sonderland of the state board of control nobody has yet filed 
a claim with the state relating to the earthquake 
the board of control staff looks at the claim solicits a 
response from the state department allegedly at fault and makes a 
recommendation to the board the board has three members the 
director of the general services department the controller and a 
governors appointee 
the board then decides whether to pay the claim the payment 
must be approved by the legislature 
however sonderland said that the board routinely rejects a 
claim such as one that might arise from the bridge or i880 
collapse if it is a complex issue of fact andor law 
this enables the individual to sue the state and go directly 
to court he said 
he said it normally takes the board 45 to 60 days to process a 
claim 
he said the board was never intended to determine complex legal

president bush inspected the ravages of the 
northern california earthquake friday breathing a single word 
jesus when he got his first look at the collapsed freeway 
still covering uncounted bodies he promised allout federal help 
with no red tape 
its been a very moving day the president said at the end 
of a fourhour tour of the region that gave him firsthand look at 
some of the areas that were hardest hit by the quake 
bush said he was willing to do whats needed to be done as 
he faced repeated questions from local officials about how much 
recovery money the government would provide and when he offered 
no details on the size of the federal contribution to relief 
efforts 
commenting theres no ceiling on the compassion of the 
american people bush declined on several occasions to rule out 
the possibility of of tax increases to pay for recovery costs 
san francisco mayor art agnos one of three mayors accompanying 
the president on his tour told him we need fast action we need 
checks written on the spot 
we will do what is necessary to fulfill our responsibility 
said the president flanked by state and federal officials 
bush said that government officials on all levels needed to 
cooperate that weve got to work with each other 
in terms of what it will cost i dont know he said but he 
added that washington will work with local and state governments 
to see the suffering is alleviated the restoration begins 
transportation secretary samuel skinner newly designated to 
head federal quakerecovery efforts promised the us government 
was prepared to play a very very major role in helping 
california 
accompanied by state officials as well as the mayors of san 
francisco oakland and alameda bush flew over some of the 
hardesthit areas by helicopter and visited the collapsed 
doubledecker expressway in oakland in which an unknown number of 
rushhour motorists are feared still entombed 
he also visited san francisco and inspected damage in the 
coastal city of santa cruz near the epicenter of tuesdays 
powerful earthquake 
the president said the most touching moment of his visit was 
when he talked to the doctor who rescued young julio berumen from a 
crushed car the doctor had to amputate the boys leg to get him 
free 
i had the opportunity to talk to the dad who was at the 
bedside of this 6yearold boy and i had a chance to tell him that 
the american people were rooting for him to tell his dad that we 
all care bush said 
in his first stop bush walked tieless and wearing a flight 
jacket with the presidential seal slowly alongside the collapsed 
freeway where workers with heavy machinery are trying to extricate 
the bodies from cars crushed between the two decks 
the ground was covered with rubble including massive chunks of 
concrete and giant fallen pillars twisted steel girders protruded 
from the structure smashed cars were visible between the upper and 
lower decks 
i am deeply moved by this saddened in some ways yet very 
stimulated by this team effort the president said 
he complimented rescue teams and added that he admired the way 
this community is pulling together well see what we can do to 
be part of the answer 
he questioned the propriety of his own visit saying i had a 
doubt is it proper for me to come here if you do they say youre 
getting in the way of the lifting or the building or the 
firefighting or whatever but he added if you dont go why 
its neglect 
bush also taped a public service television announcement 
offering encouragement to bay area residents and urging americans 
around the nation to contribute to volunteer organizations 
bush who won office on a firm pledge of no new taxes said 
im going to do what is necessary to have the federal government 
fulfill its obligation and repeated substantially the same 
phrase when asked if that meant new taxes 
gov george deukmejian has said he is willing to face a state 
tax increase if necessary and us house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash said thursday the house would vote relief funds regardless 
of what it did to the federal deficit 
in washington house democrats are working on a 25 billion 
relief package but skinner talking with reporters aboard air 
force one on the flight west said i dont know where they got 
that figure and local officials had raised damage estimates to 
55 billion on friday 
administration officials speaking only on the condition of 
anonymity said the white house request to congress would likely 
far surpass the 11 billion voted to help hurricane hugo victims 
in a meeting with local officials at moffett naval air station 
bush promised the relief effort would not become bogged down in red 
tape 
you cant have every t crossed and every i dotted bush 
said 
san francisco mayor agnos a democrat who had criticized vice 
president dan quayle for not visiting him on his trip wednesday 
told bush that his city was 90 percent back to normal still 
he said referring to the obvious damage when you walk this 
ground you feel it in your gut 
dennis kwaitkowski assistant associate director of the federal 
emergency management administration told reporters that fema would 
likely need close to 1 billion alone for its relief efforts here 
and that doesnt include major construction repairs 
kwaitkowski said fema plans to open 10 disaster centers in the 
area on sunday and eventually planned to have a total of 20 open 
including three mobile units 
california gov george deukmejian called the federal response so 
far tremendous but said the states 1 billion reserve fund 
would be soon depleted were probably looking at 3 billion or 
so in total damage he told bush 
rep norman mineta dcalif told reporters here that the total 
damage costs will run between 8 billion and 10 billion of which 
he said the federal government should pay between 5 billion and 6 
billion 
he said he did not foresee a clash between congress and bush 
over the amount of the aid package the fact that the president 
responded so quickly means that any kind of partisanship is out of 
the question

millions of dollars and offers of everything from clothing to 
chiropractors flowed into northern california on friday as 
thousands of refugees from quakebuckled homes waited anxiously in 
makeshift shelters 
relief officials worried that the aid though widespread wasnt 
enough to fill the needs of what by some estimates could be the 
most expensive natural disaster in us history 
what we need is cash said laurie levy spokesperson for the 
red cross chapter in san francisco which was routing donations of 
food clothing blankets and other goods to the salvation army and 
other aid groups 
red cross officials said most donations were welcome but some 
were illconsidered in the immediate wake of the disaster one 
company for example volunteered caseloads of rarely used dsize 
batteries in lansing mich the michigan chiropractic society 
offered its services 
at least in the first seven days we have to be handling 
peoples absolute basic life needs food clothing and shelter 
said chris garrett public information director for the red cross 
in san francisco 
we need toilet paper plastic spoons and paper plates and 
those kinds of things she said computers and fax machines were 
also being sought to enable the agency to compile lists of the 
dead injured and homeless ms garrett said 
every country in the world is calling for information she 
said 
but the most urgent requirement was for money to help relocate 
homeless families from shelters to temporary living quarters such 
as hotels ms levy said as of friday morning 5000 people were 
housed in 30 shelters in the region affected by tuesdays quake 
the red cross said 
overall an estimated 12550 people were displaced according to 
the state office of emergency services 
offers of money came from several multinational corporations 
some with longterm ties to the bay area as well as smaller 
pockets in bloomington ind two radio stations raised 40120 in 
an allday pledgeathon a tucson ariz hairstylist announced she 
would hold a cutathon sunday and donate the 5ahead proceeds 
perhaps the biggest private donation came friday from the los 
angelesbased ralph m parsons foundation funded by the estate of 
the late engineer which gave 1 million 750000 to the red 
cross and 250000 to the salvation army 
as of friday about 7 million had been pledged to the red cross 
alone ms garrett said 
japans sony corp and its subsidiary sony corp of america 
offered 1 million in aid 
we share the shock and grief of those who have suffered as a a 
result of the earthquake said neil vander dussen president of 
the park ridge njbased subsidiary 
another japanese giant mitsubishi bank ltd which owns the san 
franciscobased bank of california said it would give 300000 to 
the red cross and 100000 each to the police and fire departments 
of san francisco and oakland 
san franciscobased wells fargo bank announced a 1 million 
grant program to help communities rebuild the bank also planned to 
give a 250000 grant to the red cross 
ford motor co said it was donating 300000 to the red cross 
and 200000 to the santa clara county united way and general 
motors offered 500000 to the red cross procter amp gamble 
announced it had donated food and other products valued at more 
than 300000 
many people however simply loaned a hand the red cross has 
been deluged with 5000 volunteers ms garrett said indeed for a 
time there were more volunteers than homeless 
the ironic thing is that yesterday we had more people coming 
in to volunteer than we had a need for she said adding that 
officials were concerned that as soon as the thrill is gone the 
volunteers will disappear 
for a month well have a huge need for volunteers she said 
the soviet government offering a return favor for the millions 
of dollars and thousands of foreign rescuers and doctors that 
poured into armenia after decembers earthquake volunteered to 
send doctors geologists and rescue workers to san francisco tass 
reported friday 
red cross officials noting that thursday was the onemonth 
anniversary of hurricane hugos assault on south carolina said the 
quake would be a crushing burden to what what was already the 
highestever relief bill in the organizations 108year history 
in 1906 the red cross spent 9 million on earthquake relief 
in san francisco theres 50 times more population now and a wider 
area affected just with inflation alone you can begin to conjure 
up astronomical figures said ms garrett 
with damage estimates already at more than 55 billion the 
earthquake was the most expensive natural disaster in us history 
with the possible exception of the 1906 quake according to the 
independent insurance agents of america a trade group based in 
washington 
the 1906 devastation cost up to 58 billion in current dollars 
said becky newman a spokeswoman for the group a private 
economist frank mccormick of bank of america in san francisco 
said damage from tuesdays quake is likely to reach 10 billion

when federal judge alcee hastings eightyear legal 
battle over a bribery charge ended friday with a us senate vote 
to remove him from the bench he immediately announced he would run 
for governor 
hastings outspoken witty and a dynamic speaker almost never 
evokes a neutral reaction from those around him and the latest 
events were no exception 
hastings ouster 10 years after president carter made him 
floridas first black us district judge sparked an angry reaction 
from blacks and his political announcement surprised florida 
politicians 
the ouster sends a shocking and chilling message to black 
folks all over the country that we have not overcome yet said 
dorsey miller a miami physician and longtime hastings supporter 
its a definite travesty to our justice system said 
roosevelt walters head of the fort lauderdale branch of the 
national association for the advancement of colored people we 
have to wonder who is next who will be singled out 
we must question whether justice was truly served by the 
senate action benjamin hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said in a 
statement issued in baltimore 
hooks said the senates action in my view constitutes double 
jeopardy and this flies in the face of the foundation that buttress 
our legal system 
hastings 53 was removed for allegedly conspiring to take a 
150000 payoff to fix a court case 
a federal jury in miami acquitted him in 1983 but a subsequent 
investigation led to his impeachment last year in the house which 
accused him of plotting to obtain a bribe lying during his trial 
and an unrelated charge of improperly disclosing federal wiretap 
information 
sen connie mack rfla voted for impeachment last year while 
still a representative but did not vote in the senate floridas 
other senator democrat bob graham voted in hastings favor 
saying there was no clear and convincing evidence of his guilt 
hastings had said he would have announcement that could blunt 
angry reaction to the senate vote but his gubernatorial bid was 
unexpected 
this ranks up there as one of the most bizarre political 
events in florida said jon peck a spokesman for republican gov 
bob martinez who is up for reelection next year 
based on that track record hes going to run for governor 
peck asked anybody who wants to is welcome to run for governor 
theyll have to take on an incumbent who is going to get 
reelected 
martinez who was on a glassbottom boat off key largo with us 
interior secretary manuel lujan laughed when told of hastings 
announcement 
youll have to ask george stuart and bill nelson about that 
he said referring to the democrats in the race 
state democratic party chairman simon ferro had not heard of the 
announcement friday morning when asked to comment on hastings plan 
to run for governor 
of what ferro asked 
i would certainly like to sit down with him to assess his 
opportunities and his chances and how they might affect the race 
ferro said thats about as much as i can tell you at this 
point 
martinez faces a challenge from within his own party from state 
sen marlene woodsonhoward us rep bill nelson and orlando 
attorney george stuart are running as democrats 
nelsons campaign manager ted phelps said hastings ouster did 
not seem like an opportune time to announce for governor 
stuart was out of town and could not be reached for comment 
phelps said he believes hastings has a small following and 
will get some votes but i do not think he will be a serious 
contender 
the senates action saddened those who had worked with the 
judge whose outspoken style has won over many people and alienated 
others 
i am personally very sorry said acting chief judge william 
hoeveler we will miss him

two dissident members partly lifted the 
veil of secrecy on the swedish academy friday and said they had 
lobbied for years to give the nobel prize for literature to spanish 
writer camilo jose cela 
kerstin ekman and lars gyllensten boycotted the vote of the 
18member academy because of a dispute over its refusal to condemn 
death threats against british author salman rushdie for allegedly 
blaspheming islam in his book the satanic verses 
the academys deliberations are protected by swedish secrecy 
laws for 50 years and members are bound by an even stricter code of 
silence forbidding comments on decisons 
ekman gyllensten and a third dissident member werner 
aspenstrom handed in letters of resignation but the academy 
rejected the move because members are elected for life 
there was no immediate comment from the academy on the comments 
by ekman and gyllensten who said they welcomed the choice of cela 
73 announced thursday 
he has been one of my main candidates for some years back he 
is a very original writer with a very broad range gyllensten 
said on swedish radio i think he will be regarded as one of the 
finer choices of nobel laureates the academy has made 
i have been one of those working for this prize and im very 
glad that it came about ekman told the radio 
olof lagercrantz author and a former editorinchief of the 
influential dagens nyheter daily said the nobel prize is a 
lottery unworthy of the world of the spirit and should be 
discontinued 
asked his view of cela he said i have no view at all i have 
not read a single line by him it is so silly this prize that you 
cannot have a view on it

amtrak said friday it will add three 
highspeed express metroliner trains between washington and new 
york to compete with the airlines 
some members of the new jersey congressional delegation 
immediately protested to amtrak their state was being neglected 
because none of the new trains will stop there 
starting oct 30 the new trains one northbound and two 
southbound will make the 225mile run in 2 hours 35 minutes to 2 
hours 40 minutes one will run nonstop and the other two will 
make only one stop at new carrollton md in the washington 
suburbs the only existing express metroliner stops only at new 
carrollton on its 2hour 40minute northbound trip 
the expresses will give out free newspapers like the shuttle 
northbound expresses will sell new york subway tokens southbound 
expresses will sell washington subway fare cards 
with a fare of 74 oneway vs the shuttles 99 at rush hour 
amtrak is hoping to attract more passengers the new expresses are 
15 to 20 minutes faster than regular metroliners 55 minutes faster 
than regular trains and are close to the time needed by air when 
airporttocity center segments are included 
we feel we need to remain competitive with the airlines 
said spokesman clifford black we feel it will improve our 
revenues and the current number of metroliner stops in new 
jersey is not being reduced 
still rep matthew rinaldo a new jersey republican on the 
transportation subcommittee of the energy and commerce committee 
said theyre trying to compete with trump airlines by blazing 
through new jersey but the few minutes it takes to pick up 
passengers in metropark or newark would hardly matter 
he said adding a new jersey stop would add less than 10 minutes 
to the journey time 
this decision by your office is a shortsighted effort that 
disserves the newarknew york metropolitan area rinaldo said in 
a letter to amtrak president w graham claytor jr that was signed 
by five other members of the states 14member house delegation

moment during his friday tour of quake devastation was talking to 
the father of a 6yearold boy pulled from a crushed car and to the 
doctors who had to amputate his leg to free him 
bush after a visit to collapsed interstate highway 880 here 
talked with dr james betts the surgeon who performed the 
operation and by phone with the boys father pastor berumen who 
was at his sons bedside 
so this human dimension is brought home much more clearly by 
coming here bush told reporters in remarks at nearby moffett 
naval air station in mountain view 
the most touching moment was when this doctor this 
marvelously heroic doctor and his associate told me of pulling a 
kid out and having to amputate his leg to get him out of this 
crushed car bush said 
bush said he then talked to the father at the boys bedside 
and i had a chance to tell him that the american people were 
rooting for him to tell his dad that we all care 
julio berumen and his 8yearold sister cathy were trapped in 
a car that had been crushed when the twotier elevated expressway 
collpased when the earthquake struck 
the childrens mother and a friend had been killed instantly by 
the crash 
although cathy was freed within an hour rescuers had to cut the 
mothers body in half to get to julio doctors then had to amputate 
the boys right leg below the knee to free him from pieces of 
concrete 
betts a trauma surgeon from oakland childrens hospital 
performed the surgery at the scene on the night of the quake 
working in a tight crawl space between the layers of the pancaked 
highway 
after a walking tour of a section of the collapsed expressway 
bush went into a trailor to meet betts and a medical associate and 
to call the boys father 
how are things going he said to the boys father im 
proud of your courage proud of the doctors you be strong have 
your faith

british airways plc on friday bailed out of a 
group trying to buy ual corp a defection that sent ual stock into 
another tailspin and dealt the buyout plan its second stunning blow 
in a week 
the pilots union at uals united airlines which along with 
management is leading the buyout attempt quickly announced it was 
developing a new plan that would include for the first time 
uniteds flight attendants as partners 
but some analysts and uniteds machinists union which has 
opposed the buyout plan said british airways departure may doom 
the proposal 
in a brief statement friday in london british airways said it 
does not intend to participate in any new deal for the 
acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future it didnt give 
reasons but said its marketing agreement with united would remain 
in effect 
were obviously disappointed however we do plan to move 
ahead with our new partners the flight attendants who joined with 
us yesterday said hank krakowski a spokesman for the united 
chapter of the air line pilots association alpa represents 7000 
of uniteds 70000 workers 
the association of flight attendants which represents 14000 
workers at united issued a statement saying it would participate 
with alpa and ual management in discussions about any new proposal 
joe hopkins a spokesman for chicagobased ual said the company 
had no comment on british airways withdrawal 
the original pilotmanagement buyout proposal approved by uals 
board of directors called for ual workers to own 75 percent of the 
company management 10 percent and british airways 15 percent 
it would have been the largest employeeled buyout of a us 
company 
british airways announcement came one week after the 
pilotmanagement group said it had failed to secure financing for 
its original 675 billion 300ashare offer contributing to a 
friday the 13th selloff on wall street that resurrected fears of 
the 1987 stock market crash 
while the stock market overall has rebounded since last week 
ual shares have continued spiraling lower reflecting growing 
pessimism among investors that any debtfinanced takeover proposal 
of the airline will succeed 
ual tumbled 2162 to finish at 16850 a share friday in new 
york stock exchange trading bringing its decline for the week to 
about 110 
airline analysts in london were pessimistic about the remaining 
partners chances for success 
for the time being i think its dead to be honest said 
nick cunningham of the investment firm laing and cruickshank 
a spokesman for the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers at united agreed 
it was not a viable proposal that would have done the 
employees any good said spokesman jim conley from the washington 
headquarters of the union which represents 25000 united workers 
were hoping thatll be the end of it said conley whose 
union has maintained the pilotmanagement proposal would saddle ual 
with a dangerous debt load 
but airline analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial services 
inc in chicago said british airways may not necessarily have 
pulled out for good 
he said british airways which prides itself on being a 
firstclass carrier is unaccustomed to the indignity of whipsawing 
takeover efforts 
but they have invested very very heavily in their 
relationship with united dexter said

a protest by conscientious objectors 
outside the federal parliament building friday led to a brief fight 
between protesters and bodyguards for west berlin mayor walter 
momper 
the antimilitary service group called action for total 
refusal was protesting federal efforts to force a convicted draft 
dodger to serve jail time in west germany 
federal officials are trying to extradite gerhard scherer from 
west berlin to begin serving a fivemonth sentence for refusing 
both mandatory military service and the alternative civilian 
service option for those opposed to violence 
about 10 demonstrators protesting illegally on the parliament 
grounds startled mompers security detachment when they unfurled a 
banner that had been hidden in a bouquet of flowers the protesters 
tried to press on momper 
one of the protesters wore a rubber mask of chancellor helmut 
kohl on the back of his head and had his coat on backwards as well 
creating the impression he had his back to momper when he leaped 
forward to unfurl the banner 
security men quickled wrestled the masked protester to the 
ground and others engaged in brief battles with demonstrators to 
separate them from mompers party 
momper a member of the leftwing social democratic party had 
been asked by the antimilitary service group to reject the 
extradition request he was at the federal parliament building on 
friday to be inaugurated as president of the bundesrat the upper 
house of parliament 
demonstrations are forbidden on the west german parliament 
grounds but no arrests were made following the incident friday 
west german residents of west berlin are not subject to the 
compulsory service law because of the citys status under allied 
control 
but scherer was a resident of badenwuerttemberg state when he 
reached the military service age he is in hiding in west berlin 
where authorities have been asked to find him and return him to 
badenwuerttemberg to serve his term

a car bomb exploded friday in front of a 
hotel in the caribbean port of barranquilla seriously injuring six 
people the citys fire chief said 
barranquilla is well known in drugtrafficking circles as the 
jumpingoff point for much of the colombian cocaine that is 
smuggled into the united states 
the army headquarters in barranquilla said in a communique 
broadcast by the radio network rcn that five hotel employees and a 
guest were injured in the blast a suspect reportedly was arrested 
rcn said quoting police sources 
in other developments two more midlevel drug trafficking 
suspects were arrested and being held for extradition to the united 
states colombias federal police said and judges demanding more 
protection from traffickers ended a strike 
the national radio network caracol meanwhile reported that 
authorities took about 2000 bogota emerald dealers in for 
questioning following last weeks slayings of seven dealers in 
quipama a town 60 miles north of bogota 
authorities arrested several detained dealers and confiscated 
some small arms caracol said it said the detentions were intended 
to prevent more violence among dealers vying for control of emerald 
mines in boyaca state 
a bogota police spokeswoman said she could not confirm the 
detentions 
in the last two months 22 people have died as a result of 
battles for control of the mines 
the drug suspects were identified by colombian national police 
as robert james sokolowski and nelson cuevas ramirez both were 
arrested thursday sokolowski in cerrejon and cuevas ramirez in 
cartagena police said 
the justice department in washington said sokolowski was 
actually robert sokol jr 29 who is wanted on a 1984 federal 
indictment in greensboro nc on conspiracy to distribute cocaine 
colombian police said cuevas ramirez 55 is wanted by a new 
york federal court on charges of possession of cocaine and 
conspiracy to distribute the drug 
four drug traffickers already have been extradited to the united 
states to face trial the latest arrest brings to six the number of 
colombians awaiting extradition on drugrelated charges in the 
united states 
none of the leaders of colombias cocaine cartels however have 
been arrested since president virgilio barco announced his 
crackdown aug 18 on traffickers following the assassination of a 
leading presidential candidate 
although judges ended a threeday strike for protection from 
drug barons they said their demands were not met and they have not 
received any of the 19 million in security aid promised by 
washington 
the judges threatened to strike again if the government does not 
provide bulletproof vests bulletproof cars and bodyguards 
the government has promised for next week 25 motorcycles for 
guards 72 bulletproof vests and 14 metal detectors a lawyer with 
the union told the associated press on friday 
on nov 30 50 bulletproof cars will be turned over to judges 
who face the most danger from the traffickers said the lawyer 
gregorio oviedo all of the promised equipment is colombian he 
said 
oviedo said however the equipment will cover just 2 percent of 
the judges who have received death threats from drug traffickers 
the only protection given the countrys 5000 judges so far were 
40 bulletproof vests delivered as part of a 65 million us 
military aid package for fighting traffickers oviedo said 
but the vests weighed 45 pounds and were returned because they 
were so heavy and many of the lighterframed judges were barely 
able to walk around with them on the lawyer said 
the bomb in barranquilla placed in a renault sedan broke 
almost all the windows in the front of the 16story royal hotel 
fire chief horacio blanco told the rcn radio network several cars 
also were damaged he said 
a bomb sept 25 in the hilton hotel in another caribbean city 
cartagena killed two people 
as in the cartagena bombing no one claimed responsibility for 
the barranquilla explosion 
since the crackdown began 165 bomb blasts have killed 16 people 
and injured 201 
the federal and municipal judges and 12000 other court workers 
went on strike tuesday hours after a federal judge was murdered in 
medellin 
drug traffickers claimed responsibility and said the judge was 
killed in retaliation for the extradition to the united states of 
drug trafficking suspects 
in the last 12 years 221 colombian court workers including 42 
judges have been killed many by traffickers 
the daily el tiempo reported friday that a lawyer representing 
the medellin cocaine cartel contacted the countrys leading leftist 
presidential candidate two weeks ago 
the candidate bernardo jaramillo of the leftist patriotic union 
party and the lawyer met at jaramillos house el tiempo said the 
lawyer who was not identified made a plea for contacts between 
jaramillos party and the traffickers the daily quoted jaramillo 
as saying 
former president alfonso lopez michelsen said thursday the 
united states should give 500 million a year to colombia to fight 
drug traffickers noting washington spends millions to stop the 
advance of communism in el salvador and nicaragua

top officials of a coal mine where 10 men 
died in an explosion last month believe an acetylene torch sparked 
the blast a newspaper reported friday 
federal and state investigators have not determined what ignited 
methane gas that exploded sept 13 in the western kentucky mine 
but the evansville ind press said a cutting torch is pyro mining 
cos official theory 
investigators recovered two cutting torches from the mine soon 
after the explosion 
maurice childers chief investigator for the us mine safety 
and health administration said oct 3 that the valves on the 
torches were closed but did not rule them out as a possible source 
of ignition 
the press said pyro officials have told about 25 workers about 
the companys theory the newspaper said two of those workers 
talked to the press on condition of anonymity 
theyre leaning toward the torches the newspaper quoted one 
of the pyro employees as saying they believe there might have 
been a small pocket of methane gas to ignite and it carried 
into a bigger pocket of gas that exploded 
charles schulties president of pyro parent costain coal co 
and costain vice president jim greenlee said wednesday they have 
reached a conclusion about what caused the explosion but would not 
discuss it publicly until all mine employees were notified 
greenlee would neither confirm nor deny the cuttingtorch 
theory the press said costain officials did not return telephone 
calls friday from the associated press 
officials of the federal mine safety agency have theorized that 
shortly before the explosion company workers removed a cinderblock 
partition which helps direct air within the mine that could have 
pushed a pocket of methane gas into the area where the victims were 
working causing in an explosion the agency has said 
costain officials have said they believe the barrier was removed 
after the explosion and that it could not have been a factor even 
if it had been removed before the accident 
the william station mine has been closed since the blast but 
msha will allow it to reopen as soon as three ventilation problems 
are corrected a spokesman said friday the problems are among some 
280 citations the government has issued since the explosion 
all but 14 of the citations have been taken care of and none 
appears related to the cause of the accident joey lucas a 
spokesman for the mine safety and health administration said in 
arlington va

the space shuttles astronauts were 
told to conserve power friday for a possible one or twoday 
extension of their mission due to the threat of high winds at 
atlantis california landing site monday 
mission control directed shuttle commander don williams to shut 
down a highpower heater on a cooling system williams suggested 
also turning off one of three computer displays on the flight deck 
mission control commentator brian welch said nasa was trying to 
trim about 600 watts of power usage to enable the shuttle to stay 
in orbit longer without conservation atlantis has enough fuel 
oxygen power and other supplies to remain aloft two days beyond 
the planned fiveday mission welch said 
atlantis is scheduled to land at edwards air force base in 
californias mojave desert at 338 pm edt 
the possibility of a longer mission arose when a weather front 
moved across the shuttle landing site high winds following the 
front could be a problem for atlantis on monday forecasters said 
flight director ron dittemore told reporters that forecasters 
hope the winds will be calm by monday or at least calm enough to 
permit landing one orbit early about 90 minutes before originally 
scheduled when afternoon gusts would be less severe 
if a monday landing is impossible at edwards dittemore said 
atlantis would be kept in orbit at least an extra day 
should the winds persist for a couple days controllers would 
consider an alternate landing site he said the northrup strip at 
white sands missile range nm would be the first choice and the 
kennedy space center in florida would be second 
the astronauts spent part of the third day of their 
experimentfilled space flight demonstrating simple medical 
procedures that can be done aboard the shuttle 
in the medical demonstration astronaut shannon lucid playing 
patient floated upside down while ellen baker a physician 
took her temperature and examined her throat and ears the session 
was taped earlier in the day by the astronauts and later aired on 
nasa satellite television 
the shuttles firstaid kit carries pretty much what any 
doctors black bag would carry ms baker said it includes a 
stethoscope bandages adhesive aspirin and other common 
medications 
the astronauts also photographed the beauties and blemishes of 
earth for a documentary film 
we just got some great shots of central america right over 
the border between nicaragua and costa rica the city of san jose 
was completely clear said astronaut franklin changdiaz who was 
born in san jose costa rica and who has been a hero in that 
country since his first space shuttle mission in 1986 
he plans on saturday to speak from orbit with costa rican 
president oscar arias 
but the 70mm motion pictures arent for home movies the crews 
of several shuttle flights have been snapping thousands of feet of 
film of earths features for a documentary called exploring the 
blue planet 
the largescreen film which will debut next september at the 
national air and space museum in washington not only will show the 
grandeur of the planet but also will exhibit how it is being 
environmentally damaged by both man and nature 
the imax corp which is producing the film said it wants to 
show how such things as pollution dumps into waterways 
deforestation of rain forests storms and other phenomena have an 
impact on the globe 
the astronauts were instructed by the ground friday to 
photograph a dust storm over the african nation of chad and 
volcanoes in japan indonesia mexico and guatemala 
we also got some good shots of the straits of magellan and the 
mediterranean changdiaz said other targets friday included 
cuba and the islands of the caribbean the dallasfort worth area 
northwest africa and australia 
the astronauts also beamed to mission control brilliant 
television pictures of the aurora australis or southern lights a 
luminous show created by solar radiation interacting with the 
earths magnetic field near the south pole 
spectacular commented changdiaz 
the fifth crew member is pilot mike mcculley 
as the astronauts worked through a heavy schedule of medical and 
science experiments the nuclearpowered galileo probe they 
deployed about six hours after blastoff wednesday was hurtling 
across the solar system at 9000 mph relative to the earth and was 
in perfect shape officials reported 
the 15 billion probes course for its sixyear 24 
billionmile trip to jupiter had covered nearly 500000 miles 
friday once it reaches jupiter galileo is to orbit the planet and 
give the best look yet of another planet and find clues to the 
universes origin 
the flight team is quite exulted the overall assessment 
is that the galileo spacecraft is in really fine shape said nasa 
spokesman charles redmond 
he said that on saturday galileos computer memory could be 
disrupted by radiation from a solar flare that erupted on the sun 
thursday if so the computer should correct itself as it is 
designed to do if not the ground will do it 
the radiation dose should be greater than the spacecraft will 
encounter at jupiter redmond said and thus will be a good test of 
the vehicle this will give galileo the smart robot a chance to 
prove how smart it is he said 
weve got a full day planned for you mission control told 
the astronauts and even before they had breakfast they were asked 
to take pictures of the straits of gibraltar for the imax film 
the wakeup songs were from colleges attended by the three 
mission specialists on board boomer sooners uconn huskies 
and victory march 
lucid attended the university of oklahoma changdiaz the 
university of connecticut and baker the state university of new 
york at buffalo 
the crew continued experiments that measure earths damaged 
ozone layer and study the effects of weightlessness on the human 
body the processing of polymers and the growth of corn and ice 
crystals

devising new strategies for getting to and from work 
i really dont see how there cannot be gridlock on monday 
said a harried tom silvey a state franchise tax board worker now 
assigned to the state office of emergency services

dday along 70 miles from san francisco to santa cruz it includes 
a plan for using navy landing craft to ferry commuters between 
oakland and san francisco where four freeways and highspeed 
connectors are closed 
for much of the work force commute times are expected to 
stretch into an extra hour or more each way 
the bay area rapid transit the railroad that travels under san 
francisco bay to connect the city with east bay communities is 
running extra cars and expanding to 24hour operation daily bart 
business is expected to double to at least 300000 persontrips

oakland must now either go 20 miles south and then cross the bay on 
the san mateo bridge or take the golden gate bridge and drive 18 
miles north in marin county to cross the bay on the richmondsan 
rafael bridge the southern route costs an extra 60 miles the 
northern detour an additional 40 miles

winning a court judgment doesnt mean youll get 
your money because in real life things arent necessarily as easy 
as they appear on the television show the peoples court judge 
said 
the shows popularity has made the public more aware of 
smallclaims court but also has contributed to some unfortunate 
misconceptions judges said recently 
in some metropolitan counties the number of small claims has 
more than tripled during the 1980s 
however the legal process is not as simple as judge joseph 
wapner the blackrobed hero of the tv show sometimes makes it 
look 
although the show may be bogging down his court with claims 
cobb county chief magistrate james g bodiford said its providing 
him with better informed litigants 
the public is getting much more intelligent about small 
claims and the peoples court has helped he said 
except in collection of judgments 
on tv wapner tells the winner how much money hell collect and 
the shows producers pay him 
not so in real life where the individual must collect the 
judgment sometimes by again going to court to get wages garnisheed 
i remember one lady who walked up to me and said judge 
which office do i go to to collect my money bodiford recalled 
i said maam you have to collect the money she was just 
incensed 
the national center for state courts says the smallclaims 
caseload has nearly doubled this decade wapner who was in atlanta 
last summer to film a weeks worth of shows with local litigants 
acknowledged that his program has influenced americans to flock to 
smallclaims court in record numbers 
but before our show people didnt know that there was a 
smallclaims court that they can go to and now they do wapner 
69 said from his california office now they can go to court and 
have their dispute settled by a judge and not through fisticuffs 
in suburban gwinnett county chief magistrate warren davis is 
getting tired of hearing about wapner so he now issues a standard 
warning at the start of each session in his smallclaims court 
television is not real life 
i cant tell you how many times ive been quoted judge wapner 
in court davis said

police officers investigating reports 
that a teacher had sex with a 17yearold student interrupted a 
school staff meeting thumbing through hundreds of files and even 
examining trash 
the search oct 3 at school district headquarters and another 
one three days later at bartlett high school prompted the 
anchorage school district to sue the police and touched off a furor 
over privacy rights police use of search warrants and the 
responsibility of school officials to deal with allegations of 
misconduct among staff members 
heightening interest in the dispute is the fact that onetime 
english and journalism teacher gordon satch carlson who 
resigned in august after school officials confronted him with the 
allegations of misconduct was also a columnist for the anchorage 
daily news 
the 44yearold carlson who won a national ernest hemingway 
parody contest in 1988 quit writing the column which commented 
humorously on local politics and other topics in late august the 
newspaper didnt say why he left 
carlson has said only that he committed no crime and that some 
of the personalities involved are in hot pursuit simply because of 
who i am 
there have been no charges filed and i dont know if charges 
will be filed said jeff feldman an attorney for carlson 
im not aware that there have been any allegations made that 
constitute violations of alaska law 
the dispute surrounding carlson did not become public until oct 
3 when police led by chief kevin oleary interrupted a meeting 
at school district headquarters and searched through files and 
garbage for evidence of sexual misconduct with another warrant 
officers entered bartlett high school on oct 6 to look for samples 
of semen and hair in a music room 
school administrators say the wideranging search violated the 
privacy of personnel students and parents and went beyond what 
was authorized by the court an angry superintendent william coats 
said officers could have gotten the information they wanted simply 
by asking 
the girl at the center of the investigation court transcripts 
made public this week suggest a second may have been involved was 
older than 16 the age of consent in alaska but a separate state 
law cited in the search warrants bans sexual contact between adults 
in a position of trust and children under the age of 18 the law 
however doesnt specify whether teaching is such a position of 
trust 
for the public questions about carlsons activities appear to 
have been outdistanced by questions of school district and police 
ethics 
school officials acknowledge that they first heard of the 
allegations last may when a student claimed that another student 
had an affair with carlson both he and the girl denied it school 
officials say and the matter was not pursued until the girls 
family repeated the allegation this summer and carlson was 
confronted and resigned 
school district spokesman michael malone said appropriate 
reports were filed through the state youth services agency the 
agency contacted police after learning of the allegations from the 
school district in september 
but prosecutors suggest school officials were slow to report the 
allegations and should not have tried to deal with them internally 
instead of going to the police early on 
the schools former principal and the acting principal in 
affidavits this week denied that they were pressured by school 
officials not to report the allegations they said a police 
investigators mispresented their statements during a hearing for 
search warrants 
in a letter to the editor of both local newspapers oren bell 
argued that the school district is a welloiled machine when it 
comes to protecting its employees even to the detriment of our 
students i have no doubt whatsoever that the police department 
could not have gotten the evidence it sought by asking for it 
another school district critic charley schneider said in a 
letter that the district was wasting our money suing the 
police adding this appears to me to be an attempt to discredit 
what may come to light 
but to jim c walton the school raid suggests a pathway for 
such action on any of our homes or businesses 
if we do not protest this we are essentially allowing the 
development of a police state he said in a letter to the 
anchorage daily news 
the schools suit assailing the actions of prosecutors and 
police may be just the the first legal maneuver in the carlson case 
we are opposed to the search and we are exploring every legal 
option said jamie bollenbach executive director of the alaska 
civil liberties union 
the alaska office of the national education association which 
once counted carlson among its members is prepared to join the 
aclu in legal action president don oberg said 
meanwhile the district attorneys office and the police are 
saying little 
assistant district attorney stephen branchflower on tuesday 
declined to comment on the case deputy police chief dwayne udland 
would say only that police stand by their actions 
of course we believe we did the right thing udland said

premier turgut ozal running for president 
in defiance of growing protests failed to receive the necessary 
majority for election friday in a first ballot held at a parliament 
session boycotted by the opposition 
ozal received 247 votes from the 285 deputies of his motherland 
party in the 450member parliament 
this would be enough to put him over on a third ballot oct 31 
when a simple majority is sufficient but it fell short of the 
twothirds majority of 300 required in the first two ballots 
fethi celikbas a motherland deputy who is the only candidate 
running against ozal garnered 18 votes and the rest cast empty 
ballots 
ozal criticized the opposition boycott saying it went against 
their constitutional duty they should have named their own 
candidate and participated in the election he told a news 
conference after the balloting 
he said he planned to designate a new premier from his party 
within days after he takes over as president nov 9 that is when 
the sevenyear term of president kenan evren expires 
four motherland deputies have resigned from the party to protest 
ozals decision to run for president 
tinaz titiz a former tourism minister in the ozal government 
said in his resignation statement friday that he could not condone 
an election carried out without the participation of the opposition 
also empty were the seats reserved in the galleries for outgoing 
president evren leader of the 1980 military coup and top military 
officials 
the military always a power behind presidential elections has 
made clear it will stay out this time 
opposition parties and newspaper commentators claim ozal lacks a 
popular mandate since the motherland party suffered a major defeat 
in local elections in march the party came in third after the 
social democrats and the centrist true path party of former premier 
suleyman demirel winning 2175 percent of the votes 
they also say ozal the first premier attempting to ascend to 
the presidency in turkey cannot be the nonpartisan head of state 
required by the constitution 
erdal inonu leader of the social democrats said they would 
consider resigning from the parliament en masse if this could stop 
ozal 
if elected ozal will be turkeys eight president and the second 
who is not a former military man 
ozal was elected premier six years ago when his newly founded 
motherland party won the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule

a weekend of rain loomed as a 
threat in the mountains north of santa cruz where 60 houses some 
of them the dream homes of silicon valley commuters have tumbled 
off stilts or foundations in this hillside town and a score of 
others suffered severe damage 
on friday a team of geologists advised occupants of 100 other 
houses that they could safely return fears of massive landslides 
had earlier prompted official urgings to evacuate although many 
residents brushed them off 
its a dangerous area but all my stuff is here my dogs are 
here i figured you go down with the ship where do you go said 
todd viele 27 
the geologists determined that a jagged fissure which streaked 
through yards had caused only six of the 60 ruined houses near the 
top of blue ridge road to tumble the bedrock did not split they 
said the other damaged houses were shaken off their foundations by 
ground motion 
residents of more than 100 houses at the bottom of the road were 
told friday evening the fissure seemed unlikely to cause the 
landslides that only hours before had seemed to threaten to sweep 
them away 
they are calling it a slight fissure where the ground opened 
and shifted in a localized area said stan robustelli assistant 
chief of the boulder creek fire district they are not concerned 
about the mountain coming down at this point 
the 6800 people around boulder creek appear to be among the 
hardest hit by the earthquake and among the least willing to leave 
their homes many of them built of redwood and glass and carrying 
pricetags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in recent years 
the town was transformed from a mountain enclave of summer homes to 
a yearround community with many residents working in the nearby 
technology corridor called silicon valley 
as experts made the rounds inspecting structures friday they 
counted 82 houses that suffered moderate structural damage to total 
loss including the 60 at the top of the road 
when you start to figure percentages of people and percentages 
of homes in the area compared to san francisco we have a greater 
percentage loss here except for loss of life said fire chief 
bud tomlin we were very fortunate we didnt have any deaths or 
serious injuries 
with rain starting early saturday morning and expected to last 
through the weekend jittery residents remained concerned about the 
uncertain earth beneath their feet 
state transit crews patched deep cracks in roads to try to 
prevent rain from washing away more soil and houses 
the 100 houses at the lower end of narrow twisting blue ridge 
road were at the greatest risk because of deep cracks several 
inches wide in the pavement about 60 homes at the upper end of the 
road have already shifted up to 4 feet off their foundations or 
have fallen off stilts that propped them on the mountainside 
suzanne bellairs whose home is built on a concrete slab 
nevertheless was staying at a friends trailer that officials 
considered out of danger of landslides but she was contemplating 
going home where officials warned it might not be safe 
there isnt any doubt in my mind that if the mountain comes 
down well lose our home said bottoms 
i feel safer out of it but its more stressful being gone 
she said were staying in a 25foot trailer with four adults and 
four kids it would be better to be stressed at home

indiana farmers brushed snow off the pumpkins friday salt 
trucks made the rounds in chicago and ohio utility crews cleared 
branches and repaired power lines downed in a freak storm a day 
earlier 
the storm dumped more than 8 inches of snow in northcentral 
indiana by friday morning and 2 to 6 inches over much of illinois 
ohio southern michigan and southeast wisconsin 
farther south cities in georgia alabama florida and missouri 
logged record lows and officials there fretted over finding 
shelters for the homeless 
the snow was a mixed blessing for indiana farmers whose crops 
had been damaged by previous frosts 
it has pretty much stopped harvest said greensburg farmer 
jeff smiley however a purdue university pathologist said the cold 
weather will suppress the growth of damaging molds 
a tourist official for the brown county convention and visitors 
bureau in southern indiana bemoaned the snows abrupt intrusion on

leafpeepers to the area 40 miles south of indianapolis

gainesville causing little impact on the citrus industry farther

if we can do any good it gives us the satisfaction to know 
that the boys didnt die in vain mrs link said we cant 
bring them back but in their name we can maybe help make it so 
these things dont happen ever again and it gives us something to 
think about other than the tragedy 
youre hoping youll change things youll get people to 
listen hensinger said its always worth a try only a fool 
sits back and does nothing 
the families goals are modest no sweeping changes just a 
little more caution and a lot more accountability from employers 
even if one factory would be really safe that would make us 
feel good mrs freeze said 
the campaigners were brought together by the june 28 1988 
tragedy at bastian when jeff was overcome by hydrogen cyanide fumes 
while cleaning a holding tank bill a plant worker just four 
weeks and larry climbed in to help investigators were told 
barney once bills schoolmate valiantly tried to save them 
according to reports then craig the last rescuer slid down the 
side of the tank hitting his head his mother said 
the workers didnt know zinc cyanide residue was in the 
5by4by5 tank said david bear spokesman for the indiana 
occupational safety and health administration muriatic acid a 
dilute form of hydrochloric acid was used for the cleaning he 
said and the mixture produced the toxic gas 
iosha fined bastian 41700 claiming it hadnt provided 
adequate training respirators or rescue equipment such as a 
lifeline to pull workers out nor conducted air tests in the tank 
before anyone entered 
bastian has contested the knowing violations and paid the 
remainder totaling 1700 it has declined further comment since 
releasing a statement shortly after the accident saying we are 
sorry that it took a tragedy of these proportions to focus 
attention on the issue of industrial safety 
the parents say they knew the job could be hazardous their sons 
came home with arm or leg burns larry even told his exwife if 
i dont get out the jobs going to kill me his father said 
i took it as a figure of speech 
after the accident the families say bastian made a terrible 
situation worse by not telling them what happened 
we need answers miss irish said a lot of them 
dekalb county prosecutor monte brown has been asked by a worker 
safety watchdog group to convene a grand jury probe of the 
accident but has declined comment pending a report from the state 
department of environmental management 
five guys went to work and expected to return home said 
bill groth the watchdog groups cofounder they didnt 
something went drastically wrong 
the families are frustrated he added they want to know why 
there was a delay in calling the ambulances they cant find 
out what happened to their sons 
with groths guidance the families have become activists 
meeting with consumer groups holding news conferences and lobbying 
for stronger osha enforcement changes in workers compensation laws 
and measures to allow injured employees to sue in cases where 
employers remove warnings or safety devices from machines 
its a good catharsis for them said groth weve 
encouraged them to channel emotions in a positive way through 
political action 
theyre also consulting with a lawyer mike kendall about the 
possibility of legal action though with few exceptions workers 
compensation is the exclusive remedy for onthejob accidents 
kendall says the families have been radicalized by the 
experience 
at the same time theyve learned a hard civics lesson 
discovering that government moves slowly its agencies hamstrung by 
rules laws and dollars 
i always thought osha inspected every place every year mrs 
freeze said they dont have the money or the inspectors to do 
everything its going to have to be the employer thats going 
to have to look out for his employees 
you get so many slaps in the face all the things you find 
out mrs link said 
workers compensation for one 
jeff being a single person all we got was 2000 for funeral 
expenses they dont give you any compensation for the love you 
lost mrs link said not that any amount of money can bring 
him back 
together the families took flowers to the graves on the first 
anniversary of the accident it helps but anger remains 
they had their whole lives ahead of them none of them were 
married mrs fogle said you have so many hopes and dreams for 
your children you never think youre going to have to bury your 
children 
now five families live with memories 
of barney who stopped by each morning to tell his mother he 
loved her 
of craig who had a twinkle in his eye and a passion for music 
of bill who tinkered with cars and hoped to become a diesel 
mechanic 
of jeff who loved the mountains his parents plan to etch 
scenes of wyoming on his gravestone 
and of larry whose tombstone reads he gave his life for a 
comrade 
youve got to go on his father said or it will eat you 
up 
the families are trying to do that confident their sons would 
be proud of their crusade 
craig would say all right mom mrs fogle said i can 
just hear him say go for it

battery manslaughter murder the people 
charged with these crimes didnt lurk in alleyways they oversaw 
workplaces that prosecutors said were so unsafe it was a crime 
literally this is the final story in a series danger at work

imagine working in a factory 
where dense smoke and gases make it hard to see or breathe toxic 
dusts coat the floor and the heat in some spots approaches 250 
degrees beyond boiling water 
this isnt a 19thcentury sweatshop but prosecutors claim a 
modernday plant the chicago magnet wire corp a place so 
hazardous that the people who ran it were nothing short of criminal 
five current and former chicago magnet executives await trial on 
charges that they knowingly allowed conditions that gave more than 
40 workers nerve and lung disorders and other ailments the us 
supreme court refused this month to hear their appeal challenging 
local prosecutors jurisdiction 
this case is among a small but growing number of criminal 
charges filed against company officials for workplace deaths and 
injuries there have been others in california wisconsin michian 
indiana new york texas and illinois the latter the site of the 
nations first corporate murder convictions for an employees 
cyanide poisoning 
were likely to see more criminal prosecutions in this area 
said james holzhauer a university of chicago law school lecturer 
some prosecutors argue that monetary penalties imposed by the 
occupational safety and health administration are often too small 
to deter employers 
some people dont care if theyre fined they pass that along 
to the consumer said frank parkerson a cook county prosecutor 
in the chicago magnet case people do care about going to jail 
for 25 years 
this is not applying a different standard to employers than we 
apply to every other citizen said ken oden travis county 
attorney in texas you cant drive 120 miles an hour out of a 
school zone run over a child and say you cant be criminally 
responsible because you didnt intend the results 
but opponents say this approach could lead to a patchwork of 
local and state safety standards and undercuts osha which has 
referred 55 cases to the justice department for criminal 
prosecution since its formation in 1970 about a quarter were 
settled in pleas or trials and the justice department declined 
prosecution in the rest osha said 
workplace prosecutions are basically unfair to business and i 
dont think it advances workers safety and health said stephen 
bokat us chamber of commerce general counsel 
corporate executives have no warning of whats expected of 
them added bokat who filed a brief in the chicago magnet case 
its really an afterthefact determination by a prosecutor that 
somethings not safe 
a key contention in this debate that osha preempts local 
prosecutions reached the us supreme court after being rejected 
by the illinois supreme court which said state criminal law can 
provide a valuable and forceful supplement for worker protection 
attorneys for chicago magnet argued that local prosecutors and 
juries who may be uninformed and unconcerned are less 
qualified to ensure safety than experienced federal officials who 
set uniform standards 
whether criminal laws should be applied is a legislative 
decision added attorney robert stephenson if you want to do 
something change the law 
but the supreme court let stand the illinois ruling 
the preemption issue didnt stop the los angeles county 
district attorneys office which has a special unit for such cases 
four people convicted of involuntary manslaughter have served 
jail terms and nearly 30 misdemeanors have been prosecuted said 
fred macksoud deputy district attorney 
these are cases where the employers were just cutting corners 
more than anything he said they thought they could get away 
with it but they kill people by cutting corners 
the average fine ranges from 11000 to 30000 macksoud added 
about five times higher than oshas civil penalties 
despite some successes prosecutors filing criminal charges in 
workplace accident cases are trying to put new wine in an old 
bottle in the view of bill maakestead associate professor of 
business law and management at western illinois university who 
does not expect a proliferation of prosecutions 
these cases tend to be the more expensive the more time 
consuming and require investigative expertise often lacking in 
prosecutors offices he said terming effective osha standards a 
better way to ensure safety 
even so he added in egregious cases you need that kind of 
symbolic legal mechanism to send a strong signal 
experts say that message was sent in the 1985 landmark murder 
conviction of three officials of film recovery systems inc of elk 
grove village in the cyanide poisoning of stefan golab a polish 
immigrant working in the silver recovery plant 
golab had to work over open vats of cyanide solution but wasnt 
informed of the risks or given adequate protective gear 
prosecutors said paper masks were provided he also was refused a 
transfer after showing cyanide exposure symptoms 
workers testified they suffered headaches dizziness and 
vomiting one said the only time respirators were provided was when 
an inspector visited 
judge ronald banks called golabs death not accidental but in 
fact murder the convictions are being appealed 
in the chicago magnet case the company and five officials are 
accused of aggravated battery reckless conduct and conspiracy 
prosecutors said the plant was comparable to the sweat shops of 
the mid19th century 
abominable was prosecutor parkersons description of 
conditions at the plant where wire was coated with polyvinyl 
chloride and other chemicals 
court papers claim temperatures on the catwalks approached 250 
degrees the air was smoky workers werent given adequate masks 
gloves or boots they were exposed to the kinds of gases used as 
weapons during world war i and were hit in the chest face head 
and neck with broken wire fragments 
prosecutors claim 43 workers suffered nerve disorders 
impotence kidney failure toxic hepatitis or other injuries one 
doctor said the combination of aluminum dust on the floor and 
another chemical used at the hot plant causes brain damage and is 
associated with alzheimers disease 
until 1982 parkerson said the plant averaged more than four 
times as many injuries as employees 
osha said it last inspected chicago magnet in august 1988 and no 
citations were issued four citations in the previous 12 years 
alleging noise violations failure to inspect respirators and other 
infractions were settled for minimal amounts 
the defense has thus far addressed only preemption but bokats 
brief says the state has never contested the defendants claim 
that working conditions were in compliance with osha standards 
parkerson said the opportunity hasnt arisen yet 
osha just cant deal with people who have no intention of 
following the law at all he said 
the basic problem is the whole mentality of the business 
which deals only in money profits and losses and accepts the idea 
implicitly that human health safety and life is expendable to some 
degree weve got to change that kind of attitude

with the recording of two of the miaimi sound 
machines latest songs in spanish as well as english gloria 
estefans return to her roots is not only a nice gesture but smart 
business 
estefan a cuban immigrant recorded and released her hit song 
dont want to lose you in english and spanish this summer 
another song oye mi canto hear my voice was just 
released in europe with the bilingual touch even the music videos 
were done in both languages 
i just thought it was a little plus estefan said prior to 
leaving on a european concert tour i dont want to alienate my 
spanish fans because they have been good to me for a long time 
the miami sound machine is one of the first major rock groups to 
put both a spanish and english version of the same song on one lp 
cuts both ways has hit the top of the charts and the 
compact discs and cassettes have the two different versions 
what is happening for the spanishspeaking people is they feel 
proud about it because you didnt forget them so you identify with 
them said emilio estefan glorias husband and music producer 
who also is a cuban immigrant for the american people its 
something new and they like it 
that tested true when estefan and the group recorded and 
released anything for you in both english and spanish a couple 
of years ago 
anything for you in english was a hit and the spanish 
version gave it that final kick said larry stessel vice 
president of west coast operations in los angeles for cbs records 
the label that distributes the miami sound machine 
that final kick perhaps is coming from the growing 
audience of hispanics in the united states the us census bureau 
estimates the countrys hispanic popluation will have grown by 345 
in the last 10 years yet the total population is expected to have 
grown only 99 percent 
and that hispanic population is younger than the overall 
population which translates into more sales and more exposure 
irish rocker laura branigan said she hopes to capture a bigger 
hispanic market by making two separate albums branigan who 
recorded gloria in 1982 is working on two albums that will 
have the same music but english lyrics on one and spanish on the 
other 
other artists also have cashed in on the growing market most 
artists have taken their hit english songs and then translated them 
into spanish such as suzanne vega who did her top 10 hit luka 
and sting who did the same with fragile 
but few if any have put the spanishversion songs on a new album 
and released the songs to radio listeners in both languages at the 
same time estefan said 
we dont do it because its more commercial or because we want 
to sell more albums we do it because its very natural for us 
estefan said people feel proud about it and we feel very lucky 
that weve been able to do something for our people 
and its that sensitivity that makes gloria estefan and the 
miami sound machine unique stessel said if bon jovi wanted to 
record and release a song in both english and spanish stessel said 
it might not work as well 
i dont think that its necessarily where rock n roll is 
going i think if gets back to what comes naturally stessel 
said gloria does it because shes cuban this is something she 
does naturally

the frightening scourge of the 80s aids is 
not likely to be defeated in the 90s but new weapons may give its 
victims a fighting chance this is one of a periodic series of 
articles the 90s looking ahead to the promise and peril of 
the upcoming decade in the environment medicine technology and 
society 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the 1980s aids in the united states was largely an 
untreatable disease of middleclass white homosexuals in the 
1990s it is likely to be a treatable disease of poor black and 
hispanic heterosexuals 
and worldwide by the end of the 90s six million people may be 
ill with aids the specialists project 
in the second decade of this epidemic upon the earth the face 
of aids will change 
it will be increasingly linked with poverty passed through the 
nations slums via needles and sex 
the number of people with aids will grow dramatically as those 
who were infected throughout the 1980s fall sick 
medical science will develop more tools to control hiv the 
aids virus perhaps slowing the lethal course of the infection 
as acquired immune deficiency syndrome spreads the burden upon 
society will grow with it 
the us government estimates the cost of taking care of aids 
patients in 1992 will range from 5 billion to 13 billion 
bigcity hospitals especially those in poor neighborhoods will be 
hit hardest experts believe new york city will need 1000 to 1500 
more beds by 1991 just to deal with aids patients 
the seeds of the epidemics next decade have already been sown 
an estimated 1 million to 15 million americans are now infected 
most perhaps all will eventually become ill 
even if not another single person gets infected which of 
course wont happen there will be a steady increase in the number 
of people who get sick and die from aids over the next 10 years 
said dr william haseltine of dana farber cancer institute in 
boston 
by the end of 1992 the us public health service projects 
365000 americans will have gotten aids and 263000 of them will 
have died in 1992 alone there will be 80000 new cases of aids 
and 65000 deaths 
the virus typically lingers quietly for a decade after the 
initial infection until it eventually destroys the immune system 
causing aids the victims of the early 1990s will be the legacy of 
the epidemics silent but explosive start in the early 1980s 
most early victims were homosexual men because of safer sex 
habits the rate of new infections has slowed to a trickle among 
this group but the virus continues to spread through shared 
needles among drug addicts largely poor black and hispanic males 
in the big cities and from them to their sex partners mostly 
women 
the future of aids in the united states will depend in part on 
whether those who catch aids through sex with drug abusers will 
pass it on sexually to others if this happens there is no 
evidence of it yet aids could become a sexually transmitted 
disease of the urban poor 
thats the big question mark that hangs over the next 
decade said dr andrew r moss of the university of california 
san francisco 
the heterosexual transmission of aids is already a major problem 
in other parts of the world especially africa where 10 percent to 
15 percent of the people in some cities are thought to be infected 
we expect that the decade of the 1990s will be worse and 
perhaps much worse than the 1980s said dr jonathan m mann 
director of the world health organizations aids program 
the who has put together the educated guesses of many experts 
and projects that nine times more people around the world will get 
aids during the 1990s than during the 1980s by the year 2000 
there could be 6 million aids cases and 18 million people could be 
infected 
just how many people will have aids in the united states a 
decade from now is impossible to predict with any certainty 
what happens 10 years from now will reflect transmission that 
hasnt yet occurred said dr timothy dondero of the us centers 
for disease control there are a lot of unknowns but to me the 
biggest because its likely to have the most radical change is 
the impact of preventive therapy in infected people to prevent the 
onset of aids 
recently researchers showed that the drug azt can forestall the 
development of aids in infected people who are not yet sick if all 
goes as scientists hope other drugs under development will attack 
the virus at various stages in its life cycle the goal is to hold 
the virus in check 
hiv infection would become a chronic disease a lifelong 
disease something for which you would need to take medication for 
a long time like hypertension or diabetes said dr clifford 
lane of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
some people will still do poorly but hopefully the majority will 
be able to do much better 
instead of succumbing to aids 10 years after infection people 
might live with the virus in relatively good health for 20 or 30 
years 
many experts are less optimistic about finding a vaccine that 
will protect people from the initial aids infection the difficulty 
is in priming the body to put up impenetrable barriers that will 
prevent every single invading virus from taking root in vulnerable 
blood cells 
we know its going to be exceedingly difficult based on all 
the immune information that has been generated said dr david ho 
of cedars sinai medical center in los angeles it looks harder 
rather than easier as we learn more and more

party flags tshirts and posters 
paraphernalia of namibias independenceelection campaign abound 
in this remote outpost of the diminutive bushmen the territorys 
earliest inhabitants 
but the crucial issue among them is not independence from south 
africa its survival 
bushman farmers limited to a fraction of their traditional 
territory hope to retain enough land to raise themselves just to 
subsistence levels when namibia becomes independent after the 
voting nov 711 
those bushmen who fought for south africa during a 23year war 
against proindependence guerrillas in namibia also known as 
southwest africa are living off their last military paychecks and 
waiting to hear the armys plans for their future others languish 
in the slums of bushmanlands only town tshumkwe 
the third smallest of namibias 11 ethnic groups the 33000 
bushmen have never been united politically they are scattered 
across an arid territory and speak a halfdozen languages 
including afrikaans the language of the majority of south africas 
whites 
thirty years ago some namibian bushmen survived solely by 
hunting and gathering as did their ancestors today even the 
juwa in eastern bushmanland the only group still in possession of 
its traditional hunting grounds must raise cattle and vegetables 
to survive 
toma a young bushman who speaks afrikaans as well as juwas 
clicking language said the elections mark the first time his 
people have been wooed by political parties he hopes independence 
will bring a high school and more shops in tshumkwe a job for him 
and a better house for his family in the tiny grasshut village of 
gautcha 
the united nationssupervised elections will determine the 
makeup of a constitutionwriting assembly independence after 74 
years of south african rule will come once the constitution and 
new government are in place 
although elections are new to the bushmen they know the rural 
development policies of the new government could affect them 
dramatically 
they have been invited to community meetings by officials of the 
southwest africa peoples organization swapo the guerrilla 
movement that is the frontrunner in the campaign they have 
received free food and tshirts from supporters of swapos main 
rival the democratic turnhalle alliance 
swapo says it plans to redistribute unused or foreignowned land 
to those without property but theoben gurirab a senior swapo 
official said the party wants to get away from ethnic stereotypes 
he added that he believes bushmen have become the focus of what 
he calls disproportionate and misguided concern particularly 
abroad over what might happen to the bushmen their traditions and 
cultures 
we do not want to lock them in a zoo for foreigners to come 
and experiment on how they used to live gurirab said were 
going to look at them as citizens of namibia whose needs should be 
attended to 
gurirab condemned as sinister suggestions by south african 
officials to move to south africa bushmen soldiers worried about 
their future in independent namibia 
erno gauerke an official of the democratic turnhalle alliance 
said bushmen were struggling through a difficult transition from 
traditional to modern society he said his party a multiracial 
procapitalist coalition would try to promote rural agricultural 
development and a shift from communal to private land use 
john marshall of the juwa bushman development foundation said 
the bushmen now are namibias equivalent of indias 
untouchables but he said increasing numbers of other namibians 
could face similar hardship unless economic trends are reversed 
marshall an american filmmaker and anthropolgist whose 
organization seeks to promote smallscale farming projects in 
bushmanland said the bushmen are trapped between outsiders 
sentimental views that they should be protected from the modern 
world and the reality of their poverty 
they face death by myth he said when what they want is a 
chance to achieve selfsufficiency 
the namibian bushman population has declined at a rate of about 
5 percent every 10 years marshall said 
the rev ferdie weich of the dutch reformed church who has done 
missionary work in several bushmen communities said illiteracy is 
widespread 
at school theres a certain amount of unidentifiable 
discrimination against the bushmen he said 
because of the scarcity of teachers who speak their languages 
bushman children are taught in afrikaans 
the bushmen will be dependent for several generations on outside 
financial help and on the perserverance of those who try to assist 
them weich said 
the juwa foundation has helped establish 20 new villages in 
bushmanland where residents tend gardens and raise cattle as well 
as hunt and gather 
project director megan biesele said the farming cooperative they 
have formed is an attempt to translate their ancient system of land 
use into modern terms to gain leasehold over the area 
the foundation hopes to establish 15 more villages of 30 to 35 
people each and to improve education and health services

construction workers carving out a 
road for an elite mediterranean resort bulldozed their way into an 
ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand 
they had stumbled upon a city more than 2000 years old and 
stretching for more than a mile along egypts coastline 125 miles 
west of alexandria 
its unbelievable said ali hassan who controls egyptian 
antiquities organization operations in the region other 
countries get excited about finding an ancient house we have a 
whole city its without equal in all of egypt 
the bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were 
discovered in 1985 by that time a road had been sliced through 
what appears to have been an ancient temple but much more remained 
a few months later egyptian and polish archaeologists began 
excavating the ruins without letting word out and what theyve 
found over the last three years is in remarkable condition 
what we have in hand is a golden egg undisturbed a complete 
city that changed with time said hassan director general of 
pharaonic monuments its not only a city of the dead but also a 
city of the living side by side its something very rare and very 
important 
the city believed to have been founded in the second century 
bc lasted more than 500 years as excavators intruded on its 
serenity since 1986 antiquities officials have worked quietly in 
cairo to save the site from further destruction 
the stillunidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy 
grave 
to one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along 
the coastline by egypts ministry of housing a new apartment 
complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be 
the ruins 
the site is under our protection said sayeed tawfik 
chairman of the antiquities organization nothing can happen to 
it now 
only a small area has been excavated but archaeologists already 
have discovered wellpreserved houses vast cemeteries with 
decorated and undecorated tombs catacombs a bath a basilica and 
many artifacts imported and local including statues and frescoes 
egyptian excavators are now at work in february theyll be 
rejoined by 10 polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed 
surveys of the site and its needs 
they already have restored critical pieces that had begun to 
disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road 
walking through the excavations feisal mohammed ashmy the 
antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city pointed toward 
mounds of toppled marble columns they lay at the crest of a 
manmade ditch 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep an ancient road 
before the bulldozers got here this was a temple i think 
its terrible but we now have to focus on saving whats left he 
said 
theres so much all you have to do is to look down and 
history says take me 
early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along 
egypts mediterranean coastline villages of white houses fishing 
boats and nets and later the domes of early christian churches 
dotted the landscape vineyards olive groves fruit trees and 
almonds were plentiful families on outings sailed to outlying 
islands to drink wine 
wa daszewski head of the polish archaeological institite in 
egypt and an expert in the grecoroman period said hes delighted 
with the find 
this is a great opportunity for us to see how it was its a 
unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this 
period he said in an interview 
this was a landowners city they probably had farms 
inland but residents preferred to have their houses along the 
coast because of the cooler climate 
excavated houses are large with complex systems that carried 
rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns some are elaborately 
decorated with pillars niches statues and delicate frescoes 
the architectural decoration in the city is first class and 
wellpreserved daszewski said 
designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step 
pyramids to magnificent multistoried funerary complexes daszewski 
said burials date from the second century bc to the end of the 
third century ad but he believes the city existed in some form 
until the early seventh century 
daszewski said he knows of two possible names for the city 
leucaspis white shield which would refer to a sandspit that 
protected the harbor and antiphre or antiphra a city mentioned as 
late as the fourth century ad because of a bishop who hailed from 
there 
both are possibilities but we have a basilica here so the 
city existed during early christian times daszewski said i 
rather think its antiphre but its possible the city was called 
one thing the harbor area another we dont know 
the polish and egyptian archaeologists predict itll be years 
before excavation and restoration is completed 
maybe 10 maybe 15 maybe more said antiquities official

the tokyo international film festival still a 
fledgling event its third time around is making its mark by 
awarding the largest cash prize at any film festival to young and 
firsttime filmmakers from around the world 
this year idrissa ouedraogo of burkina faso won the sakura gold 
prize of 143000 for yaaba old woman the sakura silver 
prize of 71000 went to shunichi nagasaki of japan for the 
enchantment 
the 30 million yen 214000 prize represents a significant 
amount of freedom said director george miller witches of 
eastwick mad max a member of the jury that also included 
actor willem dafoe 
i dont know any young filmmaker who wouldnt regard that 
amount of money as something very useful to their career miller 
said i think the tokyo festival may become known as a major 
attraction for young directors because of the money as well as the 
recognition 
the 10day festival ended oct 8 with dead poets society 
starring robin williams it presented 133 movies including bill 
forsyths breaking in ron howards parenthood and yahoo 
serious young einstein 
the grand prize went to that summer of white roses by rajko 
grlic of yugoslavia a special jury prize was given to 
intergirl by the soviet unions pyotr todorovsky other winners 
included elena yakovleva intergirl best actress and marlon 
brando a dry white season best actor 
the young cinema competition was established at the first tokyo 
festival in 1985 to encourage young directors with cash prizes of 
15 million 
but the cash prize shrunk after festival organizers discovered 
that some of the winners were constrained at home in using the 
money solely for new film projects and others subsequently 
produced lessthancommercial movies with the money 
still the competition is an attraction to young directors some 
327 movies were entered in this years festival and the field was 
narrowed to 17 films from 14 countries 
the tokyo festival held every other year is still trying to 
find its place among the more glamorous and prestigious film 
festivals of the world such as the cannes film festival in france 
the tokyo event is neither a center of behindthescenes dealmaking 
nor a site of many important world premieres 
the tokyo festival is purely a matter of international 
prestige said vincent tolentino hollywood correspondent for the 
french entertainment magazine telerama 
no one makes deals here and most of the films have been seen 
before at other festivals producers and film distributors might 
touch base but its all public relations he said 
but festival organizers saw an opportunity to boost the film 
projects of fledgling directors using one thing of which japan has 
plenty money 
were certainly not the first film festival so we started the 
young cinema competition because we wanted to be known for 
something special said michio morioka director of the 
festivals young cinema competition 
we regard it as very important to aid the abilities and 
talents of young filmmakers said morioka a former producer with 
toho co one of japans major movie companies 
the fesitval costs about 5 million and about 10 percent comes 
from the government because of the high costs it isnt an annual 
event such as most international film gatherings 
the worlds biggest and most publicityprone film fesitval at 
cannes now gives 39000 to the winner of its young directors 
award and the montreal canada festival awards 50000 canadian 
dollars 42700 to the best first film 
another feature of the young cinema competition is that 
directors and often actors attend public showings of their films 
and appear onstage afterwards to discuss the movie with the 
audience 
during one such discussion eric rochant the 28yearold 
director of tough life was told by a young man that in the 
japanese studio system an aspiring film director must labor as 
long as 15 or 20 years before getting the chance to make his own 
featurelength film 
rochant said he too had to fight the odds and to circumvent 
the usual way of making a film in france to create tough life 
the story of a young parisians alienation from life and love 
in cinema you must take risks like in everything else the 
only way to do it is to do it he said

after 6 years with cbs news more than two of 
those with the nowextinct west 57th series jane wallace quit 
her star was rising then but her patience with the gypsy life had 
fallen 
id had it with traveling 250000 miles a year she said 
the pay was good she got to cover a small war among other things 
and was a summersubstitute anchor in 1984 on the cbs evening 
news 
but she was always on the go it seemed altogether checkout 
time she says when she realized that my close personal friends 
were taxi drivers and car rental people 
now having moved to miami and served as host for two people 
magazine tv specials since leaving cbs in 1987 she is starting 
life anew in cable in her own onehour weekday talk show on the 
lifetime network 
the jane wallace show is the new job premiering today its 
taped with a studio audience in astoria near manhattan one 
audience member at her first taping meredith vieira now with cbs 
60 minutes 
a class act wallace said of her old west 57th colleague and 
pal 
she spoke by phone last week while changing her clothes for the 
second show of the day im trying to get my shirt over my head 
hang on she said laughing 
her new network says it serves nearly 44 million of the nations 
509 million homes with cable its programming seeks a female 
audience 
but she says her show which she eventually hopes to do live 
wont do issues that you would stereotypically define as womens 
issues all the time we just finished taping one about mothers on 
crack 
and were about to do a show on phoebe snow who has spent the 
last eight years raising a handicapped child which is why she 
dropped out of music the shows not exclusively aimed at women 
sure lifetime partly owned by abc is a womans network 
she says but its not as if a man tunes in hes going to get a 
rash were looking to broaden what womens issues are 
considered to be 
perhaps the only talk show host around nowadays with a degree in 
political science from yale wallace from st paul minn has 
paid her journalistic dues she worked as a general assignment 
reporter at stations in new haven conn denver and here before 
joining cbs news in 1981 
she has a breezy nononsense manner and a sense of humor that 
at times can be well salty 
a few million viewers noticed this one day in 1984 when while 
subanchoring the cbs morning news she emitted an opinion that 
became a highlight on a muchcopied tape of great moments in 
broadcasting 
she had been discussing a scifi movie with the shows other 
fillin anchor bill plante props from the film were put on their 
desk she and plante were told they had four minutes to fill and to 
discuss the props 
they did but it wasnt easy finally when she thought the show 
had cut to a commercial she turned to plante she recalls and 
said i couldnt booshwah about this another minute if my life 
depended on it 
she used a naughtier word than booshwah we have changed the 
word to protect the innocent 
the studio became hushquiet she said i had to say to a 
technician excuse me did that go out on the air because i sure 
didnt mean for it to it sure went out on the air the 
technician said 
after the commercials a chastened wallace apologized on the 
air a few industry observers and inmates subsequently thought she 
had been knocking the show not so she says in fact i was just 
saying that i couldnt keep babbling about nothing 
in some tv circles such heresy would prompt demands she be 
impaled on a nielsen point be that as it may would she ever want 
to return to life as a network correspondent 
i have missed some of the people and some of the work 
wallace replied i have to say that to be honest and there 
are times i miss investigative reporting the most 
at the same time do i want to come back to that life uh 
no

the worlds first massconsumption society 
emerged in the united states in the 20th century greatly raised 
the material standard of living and reinforced the peoples innate 
optimism 
studying the phenomenon some behavioral scientists found that 
americans could be distinguished from their european cousins simply 
by their level of optimism americans expected things to get 
better others werent sure 
into the 1970s studies showed americans usually expected to be 
better off financially in the future and to have more material 
comforts they expected to do better than their parents and their 
children to do better than them 
why not in the years after world war ii many millions of jobs 
were created real incomes rose people could afford cars and 
houses and invest in stocks and bonds they earned pension rights 
they had medical insurance 
but something also may have happened to that optimism 
in a survey whose intent was to examine hopes and fears for the 
1990s hundreds of americans revealed a persistent strain of 
wariness or realism that has become mixed with the traditional high 
hopes and confidence 
the 1990s will be a decade in which the american public is not 
without optimism but neither are they without pessimism said 
frank a bennack jr in announcing the results 
we have discovered that overall people have what i believe 
must be characterized as a somber view of the 1990s he said 
bennack is president and chief executive officer of the hearst 
corporation which for the past six years has commissioned studies 
of american attitudes on major issues by its nature this one 
looked into the future a gray one 
the largest percentage of those surveyed some 38 percent 
expressed the opinion that the american standard of living will 
stay the same 29 percent said it would decline a minority 31 
percent said it would improve 
the same doubts appeared elsewhere in the survey fortyone 
percent said their personal life would be better than now in the 
year 2000 but 31 percent said it would be about the same and 23 
percent expected it to be worse 
thirtyeight percent said they felt the financial standard of 
living for all americans would stay about the same in the 1990s 29 
percent said it would decline and only 31 percent said they 
expected improvement 
the survey itself revealed some of the economic reasons for 
apprehension the national deficit was cited by 30 percent as the 
single greatest threat to the economy others named the trade 
imbalance few named recession 
fortysix percent of the respondents held the view that prices 
of singlefamily houses will be much higher 10 years from now a 
fear that contrasts with professional opinion that housing demand 
will ease after the mid1990s 
asked their opinion of the emerging european economic community 
scheduled to become effective in 1992 about three in five said it 
would create trade and economic problems for the united states 
problems not opportunities 
other areas of the survey suggested more reasons for the mixed 
views about the future based on the survey bennack said more than 
half the american public expects terrorism will become a major 
problem within the united states 
a roughly similar percentage agreed that the 1990s would be a 
decade of peace interrupted occasionally by regional military 
conflict 
bennack summed it up this way 
people feel relatively confident about their own lives but 
confidence about the big picture eludes them theres an element 
of uncertainty even pessimism concerning our societys future 
affluence it seems has made people concerned about assets and 
greater education has made them aware of the frail fabric of 
society they want more than goods a mass consumption society 
solves problems and creates them too

music and laughter drift into the 
streets from restaurants and nightspots one month after hurricane 
hugo slammed into this antebellum city 
but recovery from the worst disaster to befall south carolina in 
a century will be a long time coming as people rebuild splintered 
homes shattered dreams and a reeling economy 
there are a lot of emotional scars out there that will take a 
long time healing gov carroll campbell said last week 
everybody would like to have things just like they were and 
thats not going to be 
progress has been made since the storm came ashore in charleston 
on sept 21 killing 18 across south carolina and leaving 65000 
homeless 1 million in the dark 270000 jobless and 4 billion in 
damage 
schools have reopened and power has been restored roads have 
been cleared and the swing bridge linking the mainland and barrier 
islands northeast of charleston is back in place 
armed national guardsmen who patrolled onceshattered streets 
and army troops who helped clear debris are long gone 
restaurants and hotels have reopened but business is slow 
normally october and april are our busiest months of the year 
hopefully things will be better in the spring said jeff miller 
coowner of josiahs house restaurant in downtown charleston 
sixtythree buildings collapsed and hundreds of historic 
structures were damaged in charleston where piles of debris wait to 
be carted from some streets local officials hope to have most of 
it cleared in two weeks 
across the cooper river in suburban mount pleasant blue plastic 
sheets still protect roofs torn apart by hugos winds meanwhile 
trees siding roofs and furnishings from oceanfront homes litter 
isle of palms 
thirty miles to the northeast where the shrimping village of 
mcclellanville bore the brunt of the storm trawlers tossed onto 
land as if they were toys are being carted away for repairs 
farther up the coast the storm cut pawleys island in half the 
breech has been filled but oceanfront gaps remain where homes were 
washed away 
sumter 100 miles inland was among the hardest hit areas 
damage to utilities homes and businesses was estimated at 100 
million 
the american red cross estimates more than 23000 homes were 
destroyed or suffered heavy damage statewide the federal emergency 
management agency has distributed nearly 5 million for uninsured 
losses and temporary housing 
eightyseven people remained in the two red cross shelters still 
open last week said spokeswoman elizabeth quirk 
we still have a long way to go she said noting the agency 
is serving more than 2000 meals a day at 23 sites around the state 
families left homeless after the hurricane flooded a lowincome 
housing project in charleston do not know what to do next 
i dont know where im going to live said 78yearold rosa 
furgeson who sought refuge in ebenezer ame church the only 
thing i wish is they could turn me out to a shelter of my own 
children are living in a church shelter and attending school in 
georgetown because their homes 25 miles away in mcclellanville were 
destroyed 
i cried the first day i went to school in georgetown because i 
miss my home my school and everything dominique grant said 
gov campbell said housing is a top priority followed by 
reviving the states 47 billion tourism economy by next summer 
mayor joseph p riley jr has already urged visitors to return 
to charleston and officals in myrtle beach are mounting a 16 
million advertising campaign to lure vacationers 
we need to let the world know were ok said j michael 
pate the publisher of the sun news in myrtle beach even though 
weve taken a pretty hard blow were still in business 
south carolinas beaches which attract upwards of 15 million 
visitors a year were hit hard by the storm 
crews worked feverishly to build a sand berm to protect 
oceanfront structures from the highest tides in a decade last week 
the water lapped harmlessly against the dunes and campbell was 
criticized by some for pushing the multimilliondollar project when 
people remain homeless 
but the governor had no apologies saying getting the beaches 
back in shape is a key to jumpstarting the tourism economy 
hugos winds snapped trees causing an estimated 1 billion loss 
for the timber industry enough to build a house for every family 
in west virginia 
the farming and fishing industries also were shattered as hugo 
destroyed barns boats and packing houses the state department of 
agriculture estimates 303 million in damage to crops buildings 
and livestock statewide 
in mcclellanville shrimpers face the prospect of a bleak winter 
before they can make repairs and get back in business but 
residents promise to rebuild 
mary linen has bad dreams about the storm when she tied her 
mother and two children to the porch of her home so they wouldnt 
be washed away 
i have nightmares like im fighting for my life again she 
said but i still say we are blessed material things can be 
replaced

the handful of rock climbers who insist on 
pursuing their obscure sport amid the skyscrapers of manhattan have 
decided to do something about the acute shortage of cliffs theyve 
built an indoor climbing wall 
clambering across a plywood crag may lack the visceral thrills 
of scaling a 300foot cliff in upstate new york or a soaring spire 
in the rockies but the fake wall that opened oct 12 offers 
climbers a chance to practice most of the basic rock moves 
and more important its close to home 
its great said pierre vaz one of about 60 climbers who 
turned out for opening festivities this is a perfect time for it 
to open because its starting to get nippy outside 
the wall in a littleused city recreation center on west 59th 
sreet not far from the lincoln center for the performing arts 
occupies one end of an old paddleball court 
sheets of threequarter inch plywood are bolted to the 
20foothigh wall in replicas of the shapes climbers seek in 
nature an overhanging cliff face a narrow chimney knifeedged 
arete or buttress a twofoot roof jutting out horizontally 
bolted to the wall are knobby holds cast of sand and plastic 
resin in a variety of shapes from easily grasped buckets to 
pockets just big enough to grasp with one finger to narrow 
sloping edges that offer minimum purchase for fingertips or toes 
protected by safety ropes climbers puzzle out routes to the 
top or move delicately from one side of the wall to the other in 
that vertical ballet mountaineers call traversing 
installing the wall was more a political feat than a technical 
one 
about 18 months ago climbers who keep their skills sharp by 
working out on boulders in central park found the rangers seemed to 
be making a special effort to chase them away normally a 
disorganized lot they formed a loose alliance called the city 
climbers club of new york to lobby parks officials to call off the 
troops 
organizer ralph erenzo says he was pleasantly surprised to find 
city officials receptive to the new clubs overtures 
they quickly agreed to call off the rangers if the climbers 
would agree to avoid a few welltraveled spots 
then when the climbers mentioned they were worried about 
twisting their ankles on rocks sticking out of the ground at the 
base of their favorite 20foot cliff rat rock the city sent 
in a backhoe to clear the ground and laid in a layer of 
shockabsorbing wood chips 
the club gave us credibility said erenzo 38 who has a 
business designing and building exhibits for trade shows it 
showed them we werent a bunch of yahoos 
it turned out erenzos contact in the parks hierarchy was eager 
to encourage offbeat sports william castro the parks amp 
recreation departments assistant commissioner for recreation 
already had helped organize frisbee championships skateboard 
contests and bmx bicycle exhibitions 
and castro had dabbled with climbing in an outward boundstyle 
confidencebuilding program the city offers for teenagers 
theres a thrill from it that i dont think you get in many 
organized sports youre challenging yourself and seeing what 
youre made of castro said its a real test of the 
individual 
when erenzo started talking about artificial walls the citys 
biggest worry was the risk of someone falling and filing a lawsuit 
in several months of lobbying erenzo showed castro that 
artificial climbing walls are becoming increasingly common and 
sophisticated in europe and are slowly coming to this country the 
best known is at snowbird utah where a huge fiberglass scarp was 
the site of the international sport climbing championships in 
august 
erenzo who has been climbing for a decade and helped judge the 
snowbird contest worked to convince city officials his sport is 
safe if pursued responsibly the climbers demonstrated how they 
hang a rope from the top of a practice cliff so a partner can 
catch a climber who slips from the rock within a foot or two 
after a slide show by leading french wall designer jean marc 
blanche castro decided to give the idea a try and offered the 
skylit paddleball court in the underused recreation center 
everyone involved realizes the wall isnt accidentproof but 
theyve developed a system to lessen the legal risk climbers must 
sign a form releasing the city from liability and pay a nominal 
signup fee they must supply their own ropes and gear they must 
follow safety rules that will be enforced by a parks employee 
city carpenters built the wall at an estimated cost of 4000 
the climbers club raised 500 and the american alpine club chipped 
in 500 for the resincast holds which are produced commercially 
by several small companies 
even as the first climbers tested the feel of the new wall club 
members and officials were talking about expanding the effort if 
the wall proves popular castro said others may go up in one or two 
other spots around the city 
and the permits climbers sign to use the wall will also entitle 
them to hasslefree climbing at selected rock outcroppings in city 
parks as long as they display the permit on their posterior 
aspect

the children have returned to school 
and a paper halloween pumpkin hangs at the door but fitful sleep 
sudden anger and friends on food stamps keep hurricane hugo on the 
minds of ben and kathy troughton 
the aftermath to me has been worse than the hurricane 
mrs troughton said in an interview last week a month after the 
deadly storm slammed into south carolina 
the confusion the sadness and just watching people you know 
with everything destroyed to me is the worst part 
hugo left some 50000 people homeless 18 dead and at least 4 
billion damage in south carolina when it struck sept 21 by the 
time the hurricane faded away in the northeast 29 people on the 
us mainland and some 56 in the caribbean were dead 
like thousands of others the troughtons are trying to cope with 
the aftermath of the most expensive hurricane in us history the 
roof of their home must be replaced and the interior repainted to 
hide water damage 
frankly we feel very guilty because weve had it really so 
very easy compared to everybody else ben troughton said 
the night the hurricane came ashore with 135 mph winds the 
troughtons and their three children huddled in their splitlevel 
woodframe home across the harbor from charleston the family had 
waited too late to leave for an emergency shelter a decision 
troughton says he has only recently fully considered 
i feel like i took my childrens and my wifes lives in 
jeopardy by staying here and i would never ever do that again 
he said 
i was more scared the night of the hurricane than i ever 
was he added i had my three children lying on a mattress on 
the kitchen floor because i felt that was the safest place in the 
house and kathy and i sat there staring at each other for four 
hours 
because downed power lines and other dangerous debris littered 
the streets after the storm the troughtons sent adam 11 and 
zachary 3 to georgia to stay with relatives fifteenyearold 
scott a sophomore and football player at wando high school stayed 
behind to help remove fallen trees 
we paid the wando offensive and defensive line to come over 
and haul off the debris from the front yard said troughton who 
returned to his job at a rental car agency within a week 
at first the troughtons and their neighbors cooked on gas 
grills outside and spent most of their time in their gargages 
which were cooler than their homes with the air conditioning out 
troughton says normalcy began to return when electricity was 
restored after nine days and the children came home from georgia 
then came scotts friends six or seven a night for three 
nights staying while their own families tried to find 
replacements for their destroyed homes 
though generators no longer roar outside powerless homes mrs 
troughton and scott say sleep is still difficult for them 
youve got so much adrenaline flowing scott said youre 
scared it might happen again 
his football games and adams soccer games restarted adding to 
the sense of normalcy but with a twist spectators were 
frustrated and tired and angry and they would let the referee 
just have it said mrs troughton 
she tried to explain contradictory emotions you know that 
theres tragedy and youre real real sorry but theres that 
selfishness inside that ive got enough problems of my own 
she described being in the grocery checkout line though 
shortly after hugo and having an acquaintance turn to her 
she said have you ever used food stamps im so ashamed 
its people like that that you really do feel sorry for because 
its not only that they need it their pride is hurt

for some caribbean islands it will 
take years to recover fully from hurricane hugo but most are 
quickly bouncing back and starting to rebuild business analysts 
and government officials say 
i think initially we had thought it was going to be much worse 
than its turning out to be said dorla humes a senior economist 
for the barbadosbased caribbean development bank which is 
assessing damage on montserrat dominica and the twin island states 
of antigua and barbuda and st kittsnevis 
nevertheless ms humes and others said the widespread 
destruction of homes buildings hotels roads and utilities would 
set back the economies of the small eastern caribbean island 
nations which have grown rapidly in recent years on the strength 
of a buoyant tourism industry 
certainly for the rest of this year and perhaps well into 
next year there is going to be a slowdown in economic activity in 
most of the islands affected by the hurricane she said 
hurricane hugo buffeted a dozen islands along a 500mile arc 
from dominica to puerto rico on a twoday sweep of the eastern 
caribbean sept 1617 before slamming into the south carolina 
coast 
the storm which carried winds of 140 mph and heavy rain killed 
an estimated 56 people in the caribbean and 29 on the us 
mainland left thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars in 
damage 
in st croix in the us virgin islands about 1000 military 
police are still on duty and a nighttime curfew remains in effect 
even though there have been no disturbances since hundreds of 
residents went on a fourday looting spree during and after the 
hurricane 
st croix about 70 miles east of puerto rico was by far the 
hardest hit of the three main islands of the us territory 
federal officials said 6300 homes in st croix or onethird of 
the total were heavily damaged or destroyed power water and 
telephone service still have not been fully restored and dozens of 
plundered stores stand vacant 
the territorial government has estimated damage on st croix and 
the two other main islands st thomas and st john at 500 
million lt gov derek hodge said he thought it would take at 
least two years for st croix to fully recover 
similarly montserrat a british colony of 12500 inhabitants 
about 200 miles southeast of puerto rico was all but flattened by 
the hurricane ten people were killed and onefourth of the 
population was left homeless 
youre talking about a rewrite of that country said melvin 
edwards a regional coordinator for the caribbean association of 
industry and commerce in barbados youre going to have basically 
a different country in five years 
the french island of guadeloupe with a population of 340000 
also was extensively damaged and 15000 people were left homeless 
hundreds of conscript french soldiers are helping repair downed 
utility poles but as of last week 40 percent of the island 
remained without power and 40 percent without telephones 
elsewhere however power water and communications have been 
restored and reconstruction is well under way officials say 
in puerto rico easily the most economically advanced and with 
33 million inhabitants most populous of the islands struck by 
hugo life has virtually returned to normal except for the extreme 
east and the two small offshore islands of culebra and vieques 
banco popular puerto ricos largest bank estimated total 
damage at 11 billion dollars including lost production chief 
economist augusto amato said economic growth would probably 
constrict this year from a projected 34 percent to 31 percent 
but he said recovery is occurring so quickly the economy should be 
back to normal by the third quarter of next year 
right now the economy is recovering very very fast 
especially in the eastern quarter where most of the manufacturing 
is located amato said we had expected the blow to be more 
severe 
he said puerto rico could expect a miniboom in construction 
as the island rebuilds with millions of dollars in insurance and 
federal disaster assistance filtering through the economy the bush 
administration has allocated 11 billion in disaster assistance 
for north and south carolina puerto rico and the us virgin 
islands 
carl mitchell director of the organization of eastern caribbean 
states economic secretariat based in antigua said hugo was the 
most destructive hurricane to hit the eastern caribbean since the 
1920s 
in the four oecs countries affected montserrat dominica st 
kittsnevis and antigua and barbuda the hurricane demolished 800 
to 1000 lowincome houses and three hospitals and heavily damaged 
roads and electrical water and telephone systems 
dominica the southernmost of the islands affected escaped 
serious property damage but lost 80 percent of its banana crop 
the impoverished countrys main export and foreignexchange earner 
mitchell said 
substantial damage to citrus crops livestock poultry and the 
fishing industry also occurred throughout the region 
but mitchell said that in most of the islands the 
emergencyrelief phase is virtually over the help we will be 
looking for will be for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of

the new use of old farming practices is 
enjoying immense popularity as alternative agricultural methods 
edge further into the limelight 
dont forget the boll weevil when these newfangled farming 
methods are brought up that legendary cotton pest might be an 
example of how the good guys can win if old habits are broken and 
new methods adopted 
but first a little background 
called by a number of names low input sustainable agriculture 
or lisa is one the concept of alternative agriculture is 
attractive to many farmers because it involves cutting production 
costs and that can produce larger profits 
by whatever name advocates have been urging alternative 
agriculture for years some wanting to promote the cause of 
organic foods others seeking to improve the environment still 
others who believe farm production costs are far too high 
advocates got a big lift from the national research council in 
its sept 7 alternative agriculture report 
one major recommendation was that federal farm programs should 
be changed to encourage the use of less chemicals and to help 
farmers get back to the old system of crop rotations and other 
sound conservation practices 
wellmanaged alternative farming systems nearly always use 
less synthetic chemical pesticides fertilizers and antibiotics per 
unit of production than comparable conventional farms the report 
said 
reduced use of these inputs lowers production costs and 
lessens agricultures potential for adverse environmental and 
health effects without necessarily decreasing and in some cases 
increasing per acre crop yields and the productivity of livestock 
management systems 
now about the boll weevils contribution to the environment and 
agricultural profitability 
the boll weevil for generations of cotton farmers has been one 
of the dire threats to livelihood by the late 1920s the weevil 
had spread to the entire cotton belt from the atlantic to 
brownsville texas 
according to usda historians the entire economy of the south 
was affected farmers bankers and merchants suffered many went 
broke farms were abandoned and tenants moved away 
the era of ddt and its chemical relatives raised hopes against 
the boll weevil and other insect pests but by 1955 the weevil 
joined other insects that had developed resistance to the 
chlorinated hydrocarbons such as ddt 
gradually many of the powerful chemicals were banned or phased 
out in favor of more effective versions all were increasingly 
expensive to use 
in 1978 a smallscale cotton boll weevil eradication program 
began in parts of north and south carolina it was gradually 
expanded into all of the two states and eventually into others 
including virginia georgia florida and alabama 
the departments economic research service recently published a 
study on the economic returns from the boll weevil eradication 
project in north and south carolina from 1978 through 1987 
the eradication program yielded an annual rate of return of 
187 percent for farmers 97 percent when all public costs are 
included the report said fewer applications of pesticides 
following eradication also benefit the environment 
basically the cooperative program involved close attention to 
insect cycles tillage methods and timing targeting chemical 
applications properly and the use of many other factors relating to 
the pests and local conditions 
the economic benefit from the eradication program flow 
primarily from a 69pound gain in per acre cotton yields and an 
annual cost savings of about 30 per acre from using less 
pesticides the report said cotton land gained 14 per acre in 
value as farmers switched from less profitable crops 
researchers admitted that the weevil eradication program 
benefited from the colder weather of the carolinas and that the 
procedures may be less effective in warmer areas such as georgia 
and alabama 
further the report cautioned the high rate of return and the 
biological success of the eradication program from the carolinas 
can be extended to other regions only with extreme caution 
even within the two states there were large differences for 
example pesticide savings were only 674 per acre in the north 
carolina piedmont but were 2497 per acre in the south carolina 
piedmont 
although the weevil study did not address the broader issue of 
alternative agriculture it did highlight a few of the benefits 
suggested in the national research councils report 
in its call for more research money the councils report said 
the priorities for an expanded program for competitive research 
grants should include an analysis of pest control needs 
development of new pest management strategies should be sought 
to take advantage of cultural practices available to farmers 
crop rotations and the use of beneficial insects parasites and 
diseases to control pests it said other biological and genetic 
pest controls also should be developed 
in a way then the long war against the boll weevil may be a 
model for other efforts at least it worked in the carolinas says 
the agriculture department

jaguar plc a british luxury automaker is looking 
to produce a less expensive model appealing to business executives 
if plans for cooperation with general motors corp go through a 
jaguar executive said 
an association with a large company like gm would enable us to 
look at the possibility of introducing a smaller jaguar an area in 
which as a small independent company we cannot consider as the 
investment and componentscost would be too high jaguars david 
boole said thursday 
we want to look at other market opportunities and one of those 
is a downsized model in the 30000 to 35000 range boole said 
in a telephone interview from his home near the jaguar plant at 
coventry in the english midlands 
because we are small we are somewhat constrained in what we 
can do boole added 
jaguar cars are known for their sleek lines and highquality 
interior trim the highestpriced model costs around 64000 
sir john egan chairman of jaguar said wednesday at the opening 
of the london motorfair he hoped within one month to present his 
stockholders with a plan outlining cooperation with gm 
the plan would thwart a merger bid by ford gms us domestic 
rival which this week disclosed it has built a stake of 104 
percent in jaguar egan is set against a merger that would 
undermine his rule over one of britains most famous companies 
he told reporters that negotiations with gm the worlds biggest 
automaker could lead to jaguar receiving a huge cash injection and 
guarantee his companys independence 
british auto industry reporters said jaguar would probably 
propose to its stockholders that jaguar sell gm a 15 percent stake 
in the company in return for about 237 million cash 
jaguar currently produces 50000 cars a year and egan said the 
gm deal would enable jaguar to invest immediately in new models and 
cut spending on components by as much as 950 million a year 
gm has been a supplier for decades of gear boxes to jaguar 
said boole the most important thing for us in an association 
with gm would be access to lowcost components and to gms advanced 
research that would mean developing our current range of cars and 
making them more cost effective 
boole said jaguar would concentrate on critical items in its 
cars like body style engines and the interior trim what the 
customer sees and touches 
he said the company would look to gm for the notsocritical 
outofsight background technology of wiring harness axles 
backup systems and air bags the areas in which a small company 
like ours finds it isnt cost effective to spend time and money

soo line stock closed thursday at 2025 on the new york stock 
exchange up up 275 cents a share the stocks 52week high was 
2637 and its low was 1675

benefit from further appreciation in the value of cellular assets 
and receive a full private market price for their remaining shares 
in about five years

several clarifications including that three independent directors 
would be designated by the current board lin would have a right to 
pursue all corporate opportunities to acquire us cellular

options dealers from the pacific stock exchange may have been 
suffering from a bit of jet lag but they managed to trade 
contracts at makeshift posts built with lightening speed at 
exchanges in chicago philadelphia and new york 
it went real smooth said neal berry one of roughly 150 
traders and support staffers who were shuttled by chartered jet to 
exchanges farther east following the bay quake that knocked out 
power at their own market in san francisco 
customers could reach us we could get trades out though 
not as timely as if we were on our own exchange said berry who 
was working at the new york stock exchange on thursday 
at the chicago board options exchange spokesman warren moulds 
said there were no hitches once they got oriented it was an 
easy do 
volume was lighter than the usual 70000 contracts but traders 
said they expect activity to pick up as they become more familiar 
with their surroundings and also because of todays expiration of 
october stock options 
today is the deadline for investors to renegotiate the options 
which enable them to buy or or sell specific stocks at a specific 
price at a certain time

to hedge their stock positions in 130 underlying stocks among 
bigname stocks that have options traded only on the pacific 
exchange are hilton hotels corp and compaq computer corp 
the pacific exchange was able to continue stock trading by 
rerouting orders through the los angeles exchange but because the 
los angeles exchange doesnt trade options officials took the 
unprecedented step of relocating the options operation 
plans to transport pacific options trading began forming shortly 
after the earthquake hit late tuesday afternoon local time 
knocking out the electricity from then on it was an

the next time you write your phone number on a 
credit card receipt or obligingly hand over a credit card when 
paying by check think twice a consumer group says 
the organization bankcard holders of america says these common 
practices of stores and restaurants may lead to fraud and invasion 
of privacy 
store clerks often pressure consumers into writing their 
bankcard numbers on personal checks but these consumers dont 
realize the potential danger in doing so the groups director 
elgie holstein said at a news conference thursday 
he contended that mail order fraud and application fraud are 
increasingly popular crimes and placing this information a cards 
number and expiration date on a personal check enables a thief to 
make purchases or apply for credit in the customers name 
requiring customers to present a major credit card as 
identification or even noting on the check that the consumer holds 
a visa or mastercard can be an appropriate merchant practice 
holstein said it is dangerous however to require credit card 
numbers to be written on checks 
to help consumers deal with this practice the organization is 
making available a walletsized consumer action card to present 
to merchants who insist on writing credit card numbers on personal 
checks the wallet card alerts merchants that recording this 
information encourages fraud and may violate a customers privacy 
the bank cardholders group also is concerned that merchants 
frequently require consumers to write their phone numbers on credit 
card sales slips when processing bank credit card transactions 
holstein said this is a violation of consumers privacy rights 
also he said that under visa and mastercard operating rules 
merchants cannot refuse a customers sale just because he or she 
refuses to provide personal information on a bankcard sales slip 
merchants do not need a credit card customers phone number 
since a merchant who correctly processes a bankcard transaction is 
relieved of further financial liability by the cardholders bank 
holstein said 
bankcard holders of america describes itself as a national 
nonprofit consumer education organization 
a brochure containing the walletsized consumer action card 
is available for 100 from bha 460 spring park place suite 1000 
herndon va 22070 
by coincidence the limited inc chain of specialty apparel 
stores announced later thursday that its stores would no longer 
write credit card numbers on personal checks used for purchases and 
would no longer require a customers phone number on credit card 
sales slips 
but alfred dietzel a limited spokesman said the company was 
not motivated by concerns about fraud he said the company is 
simply hoping to serve customers more efficiently 
he said the sameday timing of the announcement was not 
intentional

a year ago this week ambassador yuriy 
dubinin led a toast at the soviet embassy with soviet champagne 
to a new joint venture between american investors and his 
government 
the idea was to capitalize in the full sense of the word on 
mikhail gorbachevs campaign of perestroika or economic 
restructuring by introducing russian products such as that 
champagne and beer to american consumers 
a year later importer torg international as the company was 
named has little to show for itself except difficulties here and 
the pitfalls of perestroika 
its englewood cliffs office closed because of internal 
problems with employees said company president dr george 
carroll a floridabased millionaire entrepreneur with a medical 
degree torg now has a new office in manhattan 
backer jay chiat of the advertising agency chiatdaymojo pulled 
out in may citing frustration with progress in importing goods 
the public relations firm hired to promote torg 
chiatdaymojoowned jessica dee communications inc was dropped 
because there was little for it to do said carroll 
now carroll and soviet emigre lev model work alone with help 
from consultants together they own 51 percent of torg one of the 
first joint ventures between a us company and the soviet union in 
this country carroll said 
he would not disclose their investment so far 
adding to their difficulties are problems connected with the 
soviet apparatus providing the goods 
i think we were somewhat premature in blowing our horn said 
carroll speaking in an interview from his winter haven fla home 
it was perhaps unrealistic of us to think of things getting 
here sooner he said 
may had been the target date for the ventures mineral water 
soft drinks to be introduced to be followed by a soviet beer 
called zhiguli 
but carroll has not given up and said torg the russian word 
for trade will become active soon 
a national distributor has been signed up to handle zhiguli 
pronounced zeeguhlee and should be bringing the brew to market 
by years end said carroll he would not identify the distributor 
discussions are continuing with distributors for soviet 
champagne wine and soft drinks made from mineral water in the 
nations georgian region he said 
in the great scheme of life i dont think were way behind 
carroll said torgs efforts have lately centered mainly on 
showing products to us distributors difficulty in obtaining 
samples is just one of the obstacles in torgs way 
he said the soviets are not used to shipping small quantities 
goods are also backed up at shipping points in that nation 
jack brougher a us commerce department expert on soviet 
trade said lack of cooperation among soviet ministries unused to 
the joint venture idea may also be holding things up 
perestroika involves decentralization of the entire foreign 
trade machinery added william d forrester president of the 
usussr trade and economic council it takes time for the 
system to adjust to change frankly i think they are doing 
remarkably well 
when torgs formation was announced there were 110 to 115 joint 
ventures with foreign companies in the soviet union about a dozen 
involved us interests now says brougher americans are involved 
in 90 of about 1000 registered joint ventures about 100 of which 
are active 
of the american joint venturers the 40yearold carrolls 
background may make him standout 
born in munich of soviet emigre parents carroll learned russian 
so he could speak to his grandmother he owns a weightloss 
franchise operation based in akron ohio and his previous holdings 
included a surgical center and medical laboratory 
he seems very suave and sophisticated said someone formerly 
involved in torg who spoke on condition of anonymity hes the 
kind of person who exudes a lot of charisma 
model has imported small amounts of soviet products for russian 
communities in the united states for nearly two decades he and 
carroll met through mutual friends

qintex entertainment inc an 
affiliate of the australian firm facing a 50 million lawsuit 
related to its failed attempt to buy mgmua communications co 
today said it has filed for protection under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code 
the company also sought chapter 11 protection thursday for two 
of its subsidiaries hal roach studios inc and qintex productions 
inc the company announced in a news release this morning 
company spokesman daniel saks reached at home by telephone 
said the bankruptcy filing was unrelated to qintex australia ltds 
failed 15 billion mgmua acquisition blaming it instead on the 
collapse of a separate qintex entertainment 59 million loan deal 
qintex entertainment was not a party to the merger with mgmua 
and it was not named in the subsequent lawsuit he said 
the company also announced that david evans had resigned as 
president and chief executive officer of qintex entertainment but 
said he would continue as a fulltime consultant until a successor 
is selected 
mgmua terminated the 15 billion acquisition by qintex 
australia which holds 43 percent of qintex entertainments stock 
earlier this month after the company failed to provide mgmua with 
a required 50 million letter of credit 
mgmua sued qintex australia for alleged breach of contract and 
fraud seeking 50 million in damages the lawsuit was pending in 
los angeles 
qintex entertainment and qintex australia were working with a 
lender to secure more than 59 million needed for a distribution 
agreement with hal roach studios saks said 
but the lender which saks refused to identify declined to 
provide the funds prompting the bankruptcy filing in los angeles 
saks said 
the 5945000 loan was for a guarantee payment against mcas 
share of a distribution agreement with hal roach studios the 
spokesman said 
it was a longstanding agreement with hal roach studios 
established before the mgmua acquisition failed he said 
declining to elaborate further on the deal 
at a meeting of qintex entertainments board of directors on 
oct 18 the bankruptcy petition was authorized to offset the loss 
of corporate assets to protect company shareholders and to deal 
with creditors claims the company said in a prepared statement 
the company also announced that roger kimmel an independent 
director of qintex entertainments ninemember board had resigned 
because he was no longer needed due to the failure of the mgmua 
acquisition 
officials said the company will continue to operate during 
chapter 11 proceedings under chapter 11 companies are protected 
from creditors while they work out financial difficulties

the united states and japan have agreed to extend 
japanese steel export restrictions for 30 more months the 
government announced friday 
under the revised usjapan pact japanese steel exports to the 
united states cannot exceed 5 percent of us annual steel 
consumption during the next 15 months michinao takahashi a 
spokesman for the ministry of international trade and industry said 
during the second 15month period beginning in january 1991 
japans quota will be 53 percent of annual us consumption 
takahashi told a news conference 
the previous agreement gave japan a 58 percent quota out of the 
184 percent of the us steel market set aside for foreign steel 
producers but japan actually exported only 42 percent of us 
consumption last year according to japanese figures 
the earlier agreement which expired sept 30 was negotiated in 
1984 to give us steelmakers breathing space from foreign 
competition and allow them to modernize 
the new agreement prohibits japan from providing any government 
aid to steelmakers for production export or research takahashi 
said 
the agreement comes after several rounds of protracted bilateral 
negotiations held in tokyo and washington 
in a short statement hikaru matsunaga the international trade 
and industry minister described the accord as a real answer to 
the current problems facing steel trade between the united states 
and japan 
he said japan would continue to make efforts to encourage the 
two countries cooperation and prosperity while working toward the 
healthy development of the worlds steel trade we strongly hope 
that the us steel industry also will make further efforts to make 
structural changes and modernize 
fridays agreement follows a statement by us president bush in 
july that washington was willing to negotiate a 30month extension 
of its general voluntary restraint agreement on steel with its 
trading partners 
in a statement released after the government announcement japan 
iron and steel federation chairman hiroshi saito said despite a 
decrease in japans quota we think the agreement is acceptable 
considering that japan is not treated unfairly compared to other 
countries including the 12member european economic community 
the eecs share in the us market tumbled from 8 percent to 56 
percent 
in a related development friday kobe steel ltd japans 
fifthlargest steel maker announced plans to set up a second steel 
factory with usx corp the largest us steel company in a 5050 
equity partnership the agreement is expected to be finalized by 
years end it said 
kobe steel spokesman yukinobu yasuda said the joint factory will 
produce hotdipped galvanized steel sheet somewhere in the us 
midwest primarily to supply automakers

moscows longstanding commitment to put more 
meat on family tables is the compelling reason behind the soviet 
unions huge orders of us corn says one of the agriculture 
departments top kremlin watchers 
the no 1 factor is that the soviets need to increase the 
output of livestock products that is meat they cant do it 
alone theyve got to import feed grains said christian foster 
of the departments economic research service then its the 
other factors that determine where theyre going to import it 
from 
during the fiscal year that ended sept 30 the soviet union 
bought a record 217 million metric tons of us grain with an 
estimated value of almost 3 billion that included a record 163 
million tons of corn and about 54 million tons of wheat 
since oct 1 the soviets have bought more than 5 million tons 
of corn including 12 million tons announced thursday plus some 
soybeans and soybean meal 
foster lists four other factors that also are influencing 
moscows decision to buy grain from the united states 
these include a reduced soviet harvest of coarse grains such 
as corn and barley in 1988 along with smaller forage crops also 
world supplies of coarse grains were tight because of last years 
drought and prices favored corn over wheat and barley 
foster also cites improved political ties between moscow and 
the united states under soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
but foster said thursday in a telephone interview that the 
improved political climate ranks quite small relative to the 
other factors that led moscow to buy so much us grain 
economics is important too he said but the soviets opted for 
us corn with prices competitive with barley from canada and the 
european economic community additionally in the 1989 fiscal year 
moscow bought a significant amount of us grain sorghum for the 
time another important livestock feed grain 
overall he said the us share of the total coarse grain 
market rose to about 70 percent last fiscal year from around 50 
percent in 1988 mostly that was at the expense of the 12nation 
eec which is geographically much closer to the huge soviet market 
if theyre buying grain economically there must be more 
reasons than price foster said you would think the eec 
would be cheaper because of logistics 
many us export advocates including recent secretaries of 
agriculture have touted the giant output potential of the american 
grain farmer and the reliability of the united states as a supplier 
the experts have noted for years that the longstanding 
commitment by moscow leaders to boost the livestock sector has been 
the underlying reason for importing grain to make up harvest 
shortfalls 
it always was a high priority foster said but its at 
its highest priority ever right now i would say because 
gorbachev to maintain support and the opposition is there 
needs to show some immediate shortterm improvement in 
consumption patterns meat products and so forth 
foster said gorbachev has had so many problems with consumer 
goods and food products that he just has to regain support if his 
reform program is going to make it anywhere 
on the matter of world trade foster thinks moscow without a 
doubt would like to be part of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade and is currently extending a few feelers 
before gorbachev soviet leaders thought the whole thing was 
an imperialist whatever he said since then theyve made it 
clear that theyre interested but have not pushed it really

milk prices at the farm are climbing steadily 
this season and the agriculture department says that is 
translating into higher prices at consumer dairy counters 
dairy markets are tight because of strong cheese sales 
nonfat dry milk exports and weakness in milk production the 
departments economic research service said thursday 
however the size of the price increases largely was 
determined by the time of events the report said milk 
production unexpectedly collapsed at midyear after commitments had 
been made for large exports of nonfat dry milk and after 
cheesemakers had decided to delay rebuilding of cheese stock until 
the flush season of higher milk production last spring 
but analysts said milk output probably will rise above 
yearearlier levels in 1990 and that seasonal easing should 
eliminate supply problems 
dairy prices will drop from this autumns highs the report 
said by next spring prices may be below a year earlier 
the farm price of milk in 1989 may average slightly more than 
1 above last years 1224 per 100 pounds the report said in 
1990 it may average below the 1988 level 
retail prices of milk and dairy products were slower to start 
rising than farm or wholesale prices however the increase in 
retail prices will be brisk during the rest of 1989 the report 
said for the first time in many years rises in retail dairy 
prices will surpass those of all food or all consumer items

wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said thursday the goal is to have plans drawn up on all

conservation plan on their highly erodible fields by the beginning 
of the 1990 calendar year and have that plan fully implemented by 
dec 31 1994 if they want to stay eligible for usda farm program

drexel burnham lambert inc will pay 
delaware 50000 and observe certain restrictions if it decides to 
do business in the state again officials said 
the new york secuurities firm in september pleaded guilty to six 
felonies and began paying 650 million to the government to settle 
securities fraud charges stemming from the governments insider 
trading investigation 
the firm said recently it expects to pay 115 million overall 
to settle with states avoid litigation and retain its ability to 
do business 
drexel spokesman steven anreder said the delaware agreement was 
similar to those reached with 25 other states drexel this year 
sold its retail brokerage business and anreder said it has no plans 
to do business in delaware 
the 50000 payment settles any administrative charges that 
would have been brought against the company by the state as a 
result of its guilty plea attorney general charles m oberlystet 
iii said thursday 
delaware had the authority to suspend drexels operating license 
some states are taking a harder line but we considered our 
enforcement priorities in making this settlement hubbard said 
noting that drexel does not have a delaware office 
if drexel decided to do business in delaware it would have to 
give us notice and get a law firm to certify that they have a 
compliance procedure to assure the state that drexel would obey 
state and federal securities laws hubbard said

californias municipal bond market the nations 
largest felt barely a ripple from the earthquake last week though 
some of the roads bridges and buildings financed by the bonds 
sustained damage 
prices of the bonds were virtually unaffected by the quake 
mutual fund operators said they received few panicky calls from 
investors in californiabased municipal bond funds and almost none 
of the investors pulled out 
one reason for the complacency is that precautions for an 
earthquake were built into most of the bonds another less 
reassuring reason is that information about the extent of quake 
damage to facilities built by the bonds was sketchy 
bond experts expect few problems with california municipal bond 
issuers making interest payments in the short term 
however over a longer period of time there could be defaults 
when reserve funds or insurance policies designed to make 
shortterm payments in such an emergency run out experts said last 
week 
we dont really know the extent of all the damage that has 
taken place its not inconceivable that there could be 
interruptions in even some of the taxsupported debt said peter 
schmitt chief operating officer of financial guarantee insurance 
co a bond insurance firm 
among the bond issues most at risk experts said are ones sold 
by small municipalities to pay for nonessential facilities such 
as secondary hospitals that may not be rebuilt if found damaged 
also at risk are bonds that financed port facilities if any 
were damaged extensively theres a chance the operators may not 
rebuild since there is strong competition from more modern ports in 
the northwest schmitt said 
a third area of concern are the socalled tax increment 
districts in california these districts were established to 
promote industrial development and taxes from the new industry go 
to pay off bonds that were sold to build highways and other 
infrastructure improvements in the areas 
if any of these areas were damaged by the quake theres no 
guarantee the industries would rebuild which means the revenue to 
pay off the bonds could drop said hyman c grossman a managing 
director at standard amp poors corp a creditrating agency 
about 30 percent of california municipal bonds issued so far 
this year carry bond insurance that guarantees interest and 
principal payments will be made for the life of the bond schmitt 
said 
of the remainder many contain other provisions to ensure 
payments such as earthquake insurance on facilities funded by the 
bonds shortterm workstoppage insurance contracts and a reserve 
fund equal to one years interest payments he said 
another protection in some issues involves the combination of 
several revenue sources to ensure that if one facility built by 
bonds is damaged related facilities would continue providing 
revenue 
for example grossman said though the bay bridge was seriously 
damaged by the quake revenue from other toll bridges in the area 
is tied into the same revenue stream and should provide enough 
money to make payments on the bonds that built the bridges 
but not all municipal bonds carry such protections by process 
of deduction there probably are some bonds out there that will have 
some interruption of payment schmitt said 
grossman said he was more concerned with the longerterm 
economic disruptions the quake may have caused if residents arent 
spending as much money due to highway damage for example local 
sales tax revenue could drop lowering the ability of 
municipalities to make bond payments 
but another effect may be that sales tax revenue will jump when 
people start buying construction materials and other goods to 
rebuild he said 
investors appeared unfazed by the quake though there were 
isolated bond issues from the quake area that declined in value 
last week most california municipal bond prices moved with the 
municipal market as a whole 
franklin resources inc operator of the nations largest mutual 
fund composed entirely of california municipal bonds said it 
received few calls from investors concerned about the funds fate 
one reason could be that phone lines into the companys san 
mateo calif headquarters were affected by the quake said 
charles johnson franklins marketing director but he said he 
believed the main reason was that investors realized the 
diversified 9 billion fund would not be affected since it is 
composed of bond issues from throughout the state 
officials of putnam and dreyfus corp two other mutual fund 
operators also reported few investor inquiries about their 
california muni funds

lower in early dealings today on the chicago board of trade as corn 
traders followed the old market adage buy the rumor sell the 
fact

soviet union had bought 12 million metric tons of us corn 
confirmed rumors of a soviet corn deal that had strongly supported 
the grain markets in thursdays trading session 
thursdays speculation about the size of the sale had ranged as 
high as 2 million metric tons 
increased foreign demand for us grains and soybeans has been a 
key factor in this weeks acrosstheboard gains but the higher 
prices have encouraged farmers to sell more of their grain and 
that was another reason for todays early decline

week also discouraged buying of futures this morning

higher with the contract for delivery in december at 406 a

like the earthquake that jolted northern 
california the us stock markets big drop sent a tremor through 
the global financial system last week 
the sudden plunge didnt appear to do lasting damage but it did 
show wall street as an unstable bellwether for the worlds equity 
markets its foundations look all the more creaky compared with the 
tokyo stock market the worlds biggest and richest tokyo slipped 
modestly after new yorks plunge but quickly recovered and ended 
last week on its customary note higher 
that performance is convincing many analysts that far from being 
a bubble about to burst japans stock market like its economy 
is a bedrock of stability thats a growing influence on world 
markets 
the tokyo market despite the fact that weve all been saying 
that its overpriced and its gone up too much performs when the 
chips are down said barton biggs chief investment strategist at 
morgan stanley amp co and chairman of the firms asset management 
arm 
the chips have been down in a big way twice in the past two 
years and each time japan has led the worlds equity markets back 
from the brink 
before black monday wiped out nearly a quarter of this countrys 
stock market values on oct 19 1987 many analysts regarded tokyo 
as the global markets weak link share prices in relation to 
earnings were at least three times as high as in new york and 
europe seemingly unsustainable heights 
but tokyo not only didnt trigger the crash its decline was the 
smallest of any major stock market and japanese stocks regained 
their precrash levels months before any others the japanese 
market did it again last week as the nikkei index erased mondays 
18 percent decline in just two days while other markets including 
new york curbed losses but remained down 
its certainly a safer place says rudiger dornbusch an 
economist at the massachusetts institute of technology i think 
the japanese know better how to manage their economy and their 
markets we make a culture out of financial vulnerability and 
volatility 
dornbusch blames much of wall streets whipsaw action on 
investor demands for instant returns buying a stock in hopes of 
selling it at a higher price within days or weeks perhaps amid 
takeover fever rather than looking at a companys longterm 
earning potential 
that tendency really goes right to the heart of problems of 
american competitiveness and manufacturing performance he says 
especially vs japan our horizon is lunchtime theirs is 10 
years 
japan also has money on its side says robert brusca chief 
economist at nikko securities co international in new york the 
cash generated by japans seemingly limitless exports of cars 
stereos and computer chips gives the tokyo market a strength that 
new york cannot match because of the big us trade deficit 
the united states has the potentially fragile market because 
we are the ones that are relying on continuous inflows of capital 
from abroad he contends 
japans buoyant economy adds an inherently stabilizing 
feature to the market says geoffrey dennis economist with james 
capel amp co in new york japan adjusted quickly to the sharp rise 
in the yen in 1986 and 1987 by relying more on domestic demand for 
growth rather than exports 
peter davies assistant vice president at nomura securities 
international inc in new york said the firms research arm 
forecasts japans economy will grow 48 percent this year and 44 
percent in 1990 compared with 29 percent and 18 percent 
respectively for the united states 
all those economic strengths havent enabled tokyo to replace 
new york as the leading influence on world equity markets however 
indeed notwithstanding tokyos relatively modest decline last 
monday european markets plummeted initially and rallied only when 
new york rebounded 
in part european traders ignored tokyos calmer reaction 
because it was expected says tim odell international market 
strategist at phillips amp drew in london unlike regulatory 
authorities in the united states and europe japanese authorities 
can put pressure on the countrys securities firms banks 
insurance companies and pension funds to avoid a selloff 
tokyos sky high prices also arent seen as relevant to new 
york london or frankfurt where dividend income plays a bigger 
role in valuing stocks japanese shares are trading at prices that 
are nearly 60 times annual earnings compared with multiples of 
about 13 in new york and 12 in london and frankfurt 
whats more european stock markets historically have moved more 
closely in step with wall street than with tokyo says davies 
all of which creates a kind of mars effect that sets japan 
apart from other financial centers nikkos brusca says the 
tokyo market sets the same kind of precedent that events on mars do 
for everyone else 
so tokyo may not be a bellwether but its ability to withstand 
the turbulence emanating from new york makes it an attractive play 
for investors looking to diversify says odell 
it is not like wall street and london he says it 
actually does reduce risk 
morgan stanleys biggs said that fact should help tokyo which 
represents about 40 percent of the worlds stock market by value 
to garner a bigger share of global investment funds compared with 
new york which accounts for about 33 percent of world equities 
youd have to say that capital is going to tend to flow 
towards the stable environment rather than the unstable one

mccaw cellular communications inc said 
friday it has received commitments from three banks to provide 12 
billion in financing for its 275 billion offer for a majority 
interest in lin broadcasting corp 
lin has taken no position on the offer and is already committed 
to a separate deal in which it plans to merge its cellular 
operations with those of bellsouth corp the regional telephone 
company based in atlanta 
a takeover of the new yorkbased lin would extend mccaws 
position as the largest company in the cellular telephone business 
mccaw said morgan guaranty trust provident national bank and 
the torontodominion bank which are jointly serving as agent banks 
on mccaws behalf have committed 12 billion in financing for the 
lin deal subject to customary conditions 
in addition it said the banks are highly confident that they 
can get commitments within the next several weeks from other 
foreign and domestic banks for the balance of 45 billion in 
financing needed for the deal 
mccaw is trying to get more financing in place than would be 
needed simply to complete its 125 a share offer for 22 million 
shares of lin stock 
that is because mccaw has offered an additional 19 billion for 
a half interest in metromedia cos new york city cellular 
franchise lin owns the other half of the franchise and has the 
right to match mccaws offer 
on thursday mccaw said it had provided clarification requested 
by lins board about terms of its oct 10 offer for 22 million of 
lins shares combined with the 51 million lin shares mccaw 
already owns acquisition of the shares would boost mccaws stake 
to about 503 percent of lins 539 million shares 
we hope that our prompt detailed response to the issues 
raised by lin will demonstrate our commitment to providing lin 
shareholders with the opportunity to fully participate in the 
growth of the private market value of the company said craig o 
mccaw chairman and chief executive of mccaw cellular 
it is important for shareholders of lin to recognize that as 
majority owners of lin our principal objective would be to 
maximize the value of all lin shares those held by the public and 
those held by us 
under the offer mccaw said it would begin an auction process in 
july 1994 that would buy out the remaining shares at a price 
roughly equivalent to what a third party may have paid for all of 
lin 
mccaw said that feature enables lin shareholders to benefit from 
further appreciation in the value of cellular assets and receive a 
full private market price for their remaining shares in about five 
years 
lins board earlier this week declined to take a position on the 
new offer from mccaw and requested clarification of its terms a 
spokeswoman for lin said friday that the company had no comment as 
yet on the mccaw letter 
in its letter mccaw affirmed that lin would have a right to 
pursue all corporate opportunities to acquire us cellular 
interests outside of mccaw interests after the deal it also said 
if lin is put up for sale in five years rather than purchased by 
mccaw at appraised private market value mccaw will not submit a 
bid unless the independent directors request it and the 
independent directors will run the sale process 
lin previously rejected as inadequate a mccaw offer of 110 a 
share for all of its stock and subsequently agreed on a deal with 
bellsouth to merge their cellular operations 
bellsouth has not yet indicated what its repsonse to the new 
offer from mccaw for lin will be 
alluding to the deal with bellsouth mccaw said we trust that 
lin will take no further actions that favor bellsouth but rather 
will conduct a fair auction of the company on a level playing 
field

ford motor co and saabscania ab said friday 
they were calling off talks analysts said might have been aimed at 
developing a european truck operation for ford 
the companies said in a joint statement that the discussions 
were friendly but produced no agreement that could make longterm 
business sense for both parties 
though it was rumored that saab had sought a buyer to help its 
troubled passenger car division the companies themselves said only 
that they were discussing possible cooperation in various areas 
ford already is a strong seller of cars in europe but lacks a 
widespread medium and heavyduty truck operation there leading 
us analysts to pinpoint saabs scania truck division as fords 
probable target 
there are a number of things that we discussed with saab but 
both companies signed a confidentiality agreement on the subjects 
we were discussing and that will remain in force ford spokesman 
bert serre said 
the discussions went on for several months he said though he 
wouldnt say how often meetings were held or who took part 
ford has its own swedish operation ford motor co ab founded 
in stockholm in 1924 to market ford products in that country 
ford announced sept 19 that it intended to acquire a 15 percent 
share of british luxury automaker jaguar plc and said monday its 
share had reached 109 percent serre wouldnt comment on whether 
fords holdings remained at that level friday 
he did say ford considered the jaguar and saab talks separate 
and progress of the jaguar move didnt lead to the end of 
discussions with saab

the prospect of another record world cocoa crop 
this season points to further downward pressure on prices which 
are already at their lowest in 14 years a leading international 
cocoa merchant said friday 
in its first forecast for the year beginning this month gill 
and duffus ltd put production at 2386 million metric tons 
231000 tons in excess of consumption 
this would be the sixth consecutive season of overproduction 
lifting world stocks to a record high of 1305 million tons and 
exacerbating current storage problems the company said 
the analysis of supplydemand fundamentals points to further 
downward pressure over the next 12 months it added 
cocoa prices once adjusted for inflation are at their lowest 
level of the postworld war ii period severely damaging the 
economies of the ivory coast ghana and other exporting countries 
that rely on the export of beans for foreign exchange earnings 
analysts said 
stocks are already at their highest level ever following the 
estimated addition of a record 314000 tons last season when 
production rose by 198000 tons to 2375 million tons according 
gill and duffuss estimates 
it put the 198889 harvest in the ivory coast at 810000 tons 
the biggest ever and 145000 above 198788

british airways plcs decision friday to pull out 
of a group attempting to buy ual corp probably wont hurt the 
carriers international marketing strategy and could be a benefit 
in the shortterm analysts said 
the british flag carrier announced friday it was pulling out of 
the group led by ual management and pilots that has been struggling 
to resurrect a buyout offer for the company parent of the second 
largest us airline 
the groups oct 13 announcement that it had failed to line up 
bank financing for its original 675 billion buyout plan helped 
spark the secondworst us stock market plunge ever 
since then the group has been trying to get support for a 
revised proposal at a lower price about 562 billion 
under the original buyout agreement british airways would have 
provided 750 million or about threequarters of the needed 
capital for the takeover and received a 15 percent stake in ual 
british airways in a brief statement friday morning said it 
does not intend to participate in any new deal for the 
acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future 
the company would not comment on its reasons for the decision 
however the statement noted that british airways twoyearold 
marketing agreement with united airlines would remain in effect 
and there is no change in the companys strategic objectives of 
seeking marketing alliances and partnerships with other airlines 
european airlines have been scrambling to link up with each 
other and with american and asian airlines to form megacarriers 
better equipped to compete in the increasingly global and 
competitive air travel industry 
analysts said the british airways decision likely was a death 
knell for the ual buyout but they also speculated the british 
carrier might participate in a future buyout plan or other hookup 
with another airline 
british airways still ultimately would like to have a greater 
presence in the us and pacific markets said andy chambers an 
analyst with nomura securities in london 
the analysts said they werent surprised by british airways 
decision 
the withdrawal would be regarded as fairly positive in the 
shortterm chambers said its actually going to enhance their 
cash flow in the immediate future 
personally i welcome it said nick cunningham an airlines 
analyst with the london investment firm laing and cruickshank i 
dont think they needed to do this deal i think they were worried 
that some other european airline would take a stake thats now 
less likely 
cunningham cited the us department of transportations recent 
decision to force klm royal dutch airlines to reduce its planned 
stake in northwest airlines klm was part of an investor group that 
acquired northwest parent nwa inc earlier this year for 365 
billion 
even though klms proposed holding was under the 25 percent 
limit the us government imposes on foreign stakes in american 
airlines the transportation department decided the size of klms 
investment would give it too much influence 
i think thats why british airways feels pretty safe pulling 
out they can always come back if another european airline steps 
in cunningham said 
if british airways really wanted a 15 percent stake in united 
airlines it could buy it in the open market at a much cheaper 
price he said 
british airways shares fell the equivalent of 2 cents to close 
at 313 a share friday on londons stock exchange

grain and soybean futures prices closed slightly 
lower friday on the chicago board of trade reflecting preweekend 
profittaking after a week of substantial gains in the corn and 
soybean markets 
forecasts for improved harvest weather next week also put 
pressure on crop prices analysts said the wintry weather that 
blasted the midwest this week slowed the harvest and contributed to 
the corn and soybean rally 
fridays losses were limited by expectations that the 
agriculture department will confirm further corn sales to the 
soviet union the soviet purchase of 12 million metric tons that 
was announced thursday fell short of the 2 million tons that 
traders had expected

cabbage patch kids the cuddly dolls that 
once were a toy industry sensation could be headed for a comeback 
thanks to a hardsell campaign that new parent hasbro inc is 
aiming at customers soft spots 
hasbro is going back to the basics the love said xavier 
roberts creator of the dolls that were so popular they caused 
nearriots in toy stores in the mid1980s 
the cabbage patch craze wilted when coleco industries inc 
which formerly owned the rights to the dolls moved away from the 
theme of love and caring and treated the dolls like any other toy 
roberts said this week 
in the past couple of years under all colecos stress and 
strain it got away from the concept roberts said 
last month two months into its contract with roberts original 
appalachian artworks hasbro launched a 7 million television 
advertising campaign for christmas that reintroduces the dolls 
original marketing concept 
it really talks about the whole adoption process and all the 
warm feelings said wayne charness a hasbro spokesman 
a cabbage patch kid comes with a birth certificate that gives 
the dolls name family history footprints and thumbprints a 
mailin adoption certificate is available if the child promises 
to love my cabbage patch kid with all my heart 
a desire to inherit the cabbage patch kids was a major reason 
why hasbro the countrys largest toymaker bought some of the 
assets of coleco a connecticutbased toy maker in chapter 11 
bankruptcycourt proceedings 
hasbro had passed up a chance to buy rights to cabbage patch in 
the early 1980s only to watch the homely stuffed dolls become an 
improbable megahit 
coleco earned wealth and renown from the dolls in the mid1980s 
but as cabbage patch fever died down toy analysts said coleco 
became one more company to be sideswiped by the fads that 
periodically sweep through the industry and then fade 
analysts also said coleco relied too heavily on cabbage patch 
under hasbro the dolls will join such proven heavyhitters as 
veteran action figure gi joe and my little pony 
in their heyday cabbage patch dolls had 600 million in 
wholesale sales in 1985 sales were approximately 60 million last 
year 
for the past two years with colecos problems there was no 
advertising charness said 
hasbro president larry bernstein noted theres a whole 
generation of kids 7 years old on down who dont even know about 
the original concept 
charness would not reveal estimates but said early reports 
showed strong retail sales 
i firmly belive cabbage can be back up there said roberts 
he said the best chances for longterm growth will come when 
children who grew up with the dolls become adults and buy them for 
their own children 
laurie lively a toy analyst for oppenheimer amp co said cabbage 
patch wont be able to break its sales record because it no longer 
is the novelty item that had parents crowding store aisles a few 
years ago the dolls sell for between 15 and 40 
i wouldnt be surprised at all if it achieved 100 million or 
even 150 million but 600 million seems like a stretch she 
said 
roberts 33 an artist created the doll in 1978 as a form of 
soft sculpture for adults the first dolls were modeled after real 
children 
i never really considered it a toy said roberts who gets 
an undisclosed royalty under the licensing agreement i intended 
it for adults i saw it as a new art form 
in 1983 he reached an agreement with coleco that called for the 
massproduced dolls to each have slight differences in hair eyes 
freckles and dimples 
some dolls the original cabbage patch kids still are handmade 
by about a dozen artists at the former cleveland ga hospital 
where roberts moved his studio and where he got the idea to have 
children adopt the dolls 
the handmade versions sell for 150 to 1000 
it has proven the test of time that its a stayer said 
hasbros charness it has proven it will be charming little boys 
and little girls for years to come

a federal appeals court has ruled against 
travelers corp saying the hartfordbased insurer and not its 
policyholder should pay for legal costs associated with a pollution 
case 
the case stems from travelers refusal to represent avondale 
industries inc of new orleans in a louisiana state proceeding 
involving pollution at an avondale oil recycling plant 
louisiana told avondale in 1986 it was potentially liable for 
cleanup costs at the plant avondale asked travelers to defend it 
in a state proceeding but travelers failed to respond 
travelers has contended that government proceedings informing a 
company that it might be responsible for cleanup are technically 
not lawsuits and thus are not covered by policies 
travelers also claimed as have other insurance companies that 
cleanup costs do not constitute damages within the meaning of 
comprehensive general coverage 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york ruled on 
wednesday however that travelers was obligated to defend avondale 
in the state proceedings 
we think that an ordinary businessman reading this policy 
would have beleived himself covered by the demands and potential 
damage claims the court said in its decision 
state and federal courts have been divided on whether commercial 
generalliability policies cover cleanup costs under federal law 
kenneth abraham a professor of environmental law at the 
university of virginia said thursday the ruling was important 
because many policies are issued out of new york he said the 
ruling reverses a recent string of victories by insurance companies 
travelers attorney mary kay vyskocil of new york said the 
insurer will appeal

warner bros has stepped up its efforts to 
prevent sony corp from hiring producers peter guber and jon peters 
to head the entertainment company sony plans to acquire columbia 
pictures 
a motion for a preliminary injunction filed thursday in los 
angeles superior court asks a judge to bar sony from hiring the 
batman producers who are trying to get out of a fiveyear 
contract they signed with warner earlier this year 
the action follows a 1 billion lawsuit filed last week by 
warner against sony and a 100 million countersuit sony filed 
against warner 
terry christensen an attorney for guber and peters said he 
believed warner filed the suit for publicity and bargaining 
purposes 
i dont think its real christensen said its a further 
attempt to hammer sony 
the producers contend they had a verbal agreement with warner 
that they would be allowed out of their contract if a chance to run 
a big studio came along but in affidavits filed thursday top 
warner executives denied that was true 
the motion for an injunction also is meant to allow guber and 
peters to keep working for warner while the opposing lawsuits go 
through the legal system a process that could take years warner 
attorney stuart robinowitz said 
guber and peters have about 50 projects planned for the next few 
years including sequels to the megahit batman 
without the injunction the producers could possibly find 
themselves unable to work for either company during the litigation 
robinowitz said 
sony recently announced plans to put guber and peters whose 
credits also include rain man in charge of columbia after it 
acquires the entertainment company in a 34 billion tender offer 
sony also plans to acquire guberpeters entertainment co for 
about 200 million or 1750 per share 
but warner contended in court papers the move to hire away guber 
and peters would violate its fiveyear exclusive production 
contract with the producers 
a hearing on the injunction was scheduled for nov 2 
the filing for the injunction came on the heels of lawsuits sony 
and warner filed against each other last week in los angeles 
superior court

texaco inc said friday it has agreed to acquire 
tana production corp in a deal valued at 4765 million part of 
a continuing effort to expand oil and gas reserves and texacos 
first major purchase since completing a massive restructuring 
earlier this year 
the merger with corpus christi texasbased tana production a 
subsidiary of trt energy holdings inc includes the purchase of 
435 billion cubic feet of natural gas and about 4 million barrels 
of oil located in 17 south texas fields texaco said 
texaco will pay 951 million in cash and the remaining 3814 
million in shares of a new nonvoting issue of texaco series e 
variablerate preferred stock 
the acquisition subject to the approval of government 
regulators is expected to be completed by the end of the year 
said texaco based in white plains ny 
we have long said that our selected focus is to maintain a 
strong reserve base in the united states said texaco president 
james w kinnear this agreement will increase texacos 
domestic reserves at a very attractive price 
industry analysts said the merger was not a surprise 
now that they have reduced debt significantly they can do 
this said frank p knuettel analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc texaco has made a number of sales this is their 
first big buy 
some analysts said the purchase was significant in that it 
showed a reversal from recent years when texaco entered bankruptcy 
court and underwent a major restructuring 
this sets a new course in terms of reversing the direction of 
the last couple of years when they were divesting assets said 
michael young analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
texaco filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy laws in april 1987 to avoid having to 
post a multibilliondollar security bond in its fight with pennzoil 
co 
pennzoil had sued claiming texacos 1984 acquisition of getty 
oil co interfered with pennzoils prior contract to buy part of 
reserverich getty a houston jury awarded pennzoil a 103 billion 
judgment texaco appealed but eventually settled with pennzoil for 
3 billion 
earlier this year texaco completed a major restructuring that 
involved the sale of some 7 billion in assets last year texaco 
turned a profit of 13 billion compared with a 1987 loss of 414 
billion texaco has said the company expects a further improvement 
in 1989 
the tana purchase strengthens texacos position as a seller and 
producer of natural gas in the united states kinnear said texaco 
already is one of the largest producers of natural gas in this 
country 
we feel that natural gas is a fine fuel for the future for the 
highest and best use for home heating for power generation for 
cogeneration and for environmental concerns 
kinnear said however he does not expect natural gas to 
challenge gasoline as a motor fuel 
texaco starting with the 1984 acquisition of getty oil has 
attempted to improve its eroding domestic reserve base

when the dow jones industrial average plunges 
more than 200 points one week and rebounds by more than 100 the 
next what sense can any follower of the stock market make of it 
all 
thats precisely what has happened this month in an 
appropriately dramatic observance of the anniversaries of both the 
market meltdown of 1987 and the great crash of 1929 
after taking a 21626point slide oct 913 it climbed a record 
11988 points last week 
an onlooker might dismiss this performance as just another 
example of the anythinggoes mentality that has prevailed on wall 
street for much of the 1980s 
it might with some accuracy also be ascribed to the 
mischievous forces of program trading which allows traders to 
deluge the floor of the new york stock exchange with millions of 
dollars worth of orders in the blink of a computer terminal screen 
whatever its other causes it must be noted that some of the 
volatility exhibited by the dow average these days is a 
mathematical illusion 
though its caretakers have taken considerable pains to preserve 
it as a wall street institution the dow average simply is not 
quite the same creature it was 10 or 20 years ago 
the most obvious difference is its natural tendency to post 
larger daily point gains now that it has reached levels two three 
or even five times where it stood a decade or two ago 
the averages 19058 loss on friday the 13th this month was its 
second largest point decline ever exceeded only by the 508point 
drop it suffered on black monday two years ago 
but in percentage terms it didnt even make the top ten in the 
wall street record books 
a second important and more subtle change has arisen from the 
way the average is adjusted over time to take into account 
developments such as splits in its component stocks 
if there never were any such changes in its makeup the average 
could be computed at any time simply by adding up the prices of the 
30 individual stocks and then dividing by 30 
but because innumerable splits have taken place over the years 
the divisor has steadily dwindled down dropping below 1 in 1986 
it now stands at 061 
that means that if each of the 30 stocks in the dow were to rise 
or fall 1 point the average would show a gain or loss of 49 points 
in fact the divisor has shrunk by more than half since the end 
of 1983 
periodically in recent years some wall streeters have urged 
that the dow itself be split reduced to onehalf or onethird of 
its previous value with a proportionate revision of the divisor 
and adjustment of historical data in order to lessen the 
perceived volatility of stock prices 
these campaigns havent ever gone very far however since such 
a move would put a great many asterisks in market history and 
create the possibility of a lot of confusion 
the industrial averages historical continuityis one of its 
most popular features wrote victor j hillery a longtime 
market chronicler for the wall street journal in a 1986 book on 
the history of the dow 
the debate on such matters promises to continue as the 
bostonbased united amp babson investment report puts it in a current 
look at the average 
some say it is too small stodgy and misleading but the dow 
jones industrial average is still the market to most people

call it opportunity or ghoulish economics but 
the killer california earthquake of 1989 has aroused enthusiasm 
among investors and speculators as a new source of multibillion 
dollar profits 
the 69 richter scale temblor that heaved the san francisco bay 
area this past week was by far the worst to hit the region since 
the great quake of 1906 and was the third major natural disaster to 
befall the country in weeks parts of the south still are cleaning 
up from two big hurricanes 
almost immediately after the quake collapsed buildings and 
entombed dead motorists in crushed cars under a toppled freeway 
the dispassionate market strategists of stocks and bonds were busy 
reckoning which companies would benefit from demand for 
reconstruction and an outpouring of federal aid damage estimates 
surpassed 4 billion by friday 
shares of homebuilders cement makers and lumber companies got a 
big boost from the quake some large insurance companies also 
benefited on the hunch that they would be able to use the 
opportunity to raise rates 
a few leading wall street brokerages were touting 
georgiapacific and willamette industries inc for example as 
opportunities in what the wall street journal described as the 
best postquake plywood plays 
that may sound horrifying and repugnant but many economists say 
such a reaction misses the point they argue that the quick 
response by investors is part of the efficiency that makes the 
american economy function smoothly 
some even contend that profound calamities like earthquakes and 
hurricanes actually boost overall economic growth over a long 
period of time by creating an enormous demand for goods and 
services in afflicted areas a few suggested the earthquake helped 
stabilize the wobbly us stock market 
the initial impact is a drain on the growth rate of the 
economy said thomas f carpenter director of economics for asb 
capital management a washington investment concern but later he 
said what is torn down gets rebuilt and that rebuilding 
activity is obviously a generator of income and employment and acts 
as a positive factor a positive thrust 
other economists sharply disagree with that line of thinking 
they say disasters are bad period 
i guess i dont have a lot of sympathy with the argument that 
if you want to have a robust economy you ought to have a war 
said gail fosler chief economist of the conference board a new 
yorkbased business research group 
i think the perverse impact of this kind of disaster economic 
activity just goes to show you can get very perverse results if 
you look at the wrong targets she said you would have been 
net better off had you not had the disaster 
deborah allen president of the claremont economics institute a 
consulting firm in claremont calif said the argument that 
disasters create economic growth is flawed because wealth must be 
destroyed first 
you have a tremendous growth spurt but its from a lower 
base she said a few years later net youre worse off you 
havent produced something new that you didnt have yesterday 
guy henshaw president of civicbankcorp in oakland calif said 
there probably was some truth to the idea that the infrastructure 
damage to the nations fourthlargest metropolitan area would 
generate much more economic activity he said rumors were 
circulating that vast areas of downtown office space in oakland 
were condemned because of damage 
that means some of the overcapacity has gone away that will 
help he said its somewhat black humor but at least weve 
got the capacity to rebuild 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the weakened stock market largely recovered after one of the 
most uncertain weeks since the black monday crash exactly two years 
earlier investment professionals attributed the comeback largely

deal for ual corp 
ual shares which traded as high as 294 before buyout plans for 
the company ran into trouble tumbled 21 to 168 
however in contrast to a week earlier when the deal first went 
sour the action in ual was no longer dragging the rest of the 
market down with it 
this week many analysts have suggested that fading enthusiasm 
for takeover speculation might be a plus for the overall market by 
restoring an emphasis on such traditional reference points as 
earnings and dividend growth

they waited for the passing of another monthly witching hour

index futures contracts

the television arms of paramount communications 
inc and mca inc have described to some station executives a plan 
to offer primetime programming two nights a week as a step toward 
creating a fifth tv network industry executives said friday 
the network the executives said was described by paramount and 
mca would compete with nbc abc cbs and fox broadcasting co 
reports of plans for the network were carried first by daily 
variety the trade newspaper earlier this week and several major 
newspapers subsequently carried similar accounts of the plans 
but the los angeles times reported friday that the deal 
apparently had fallen apart 
citing an unidentified source familiar with the deal the times 
said there was a socalled programming service that had been on 
the boards but a snag developed in the agreement between paramount 
and mca as a result of which this activity has been discontinued 
a spokeswoman for paramount said from los angeles that her 
company does not comment on rumors or speculation a call was 
placed to shelly schwab president of mca tv in los angeles but it 
was not returned and others in the company said they were not 
authorized to comment on any of the reports 
brad turell a spokesman for fox broadcasting in los angeles 
said some of our affiliates have been contacted by paramount 
and mca about whether they would be interested in carrying some 
primetime programming 
michael fisher president and general manager at ktxl in 
sacramento calif and head of the fox affiliates board said at 
least one fox affiliate who he declined to identify told him that 
paramount and mca executives had described plans to make two nights 
of primetime programming available starting jan 1 1991 
the plans were to program movies on wednesday nights and offer 
tv series on friday nights he said the plans were to make a third 
night of programming available about six months later fisher said 
fisher who said he was not approached by paramount or mca said 
he was told paramount and mca were interested in starting a fifth 
network 
but fisher said he thought it was unlikely that any fox 
affiliates would defect they have been with fox for three years 
and fox has done precisely what they said they were going to do 
he said 
fox offers network programming on three nights and claims 127 
affiliate stations it plans to add two additional nights of 
programming next year and offer programming on all seven nights a 
week in 1992 
turell said top fox broadcasting executives planned to meet with 
fox affiliates in a series of six regional meetings next week to 
reaffirm the companys plans 
mca owns wwortv in new york and paramount last month agreed to 
buy a 79 percent stake in the tvx broadcast group which owns five 
stations 
those stations could form the core for a new network 
last month paramount and mca announced a joint venture called 
premier advertiser sales to sell advertising in programs they 
syndicate 
those shows include star trek the next generation and 
charles in charge

though the financial storm that many feared 
never struck wall street analysts still arent sure the stock 
market is headed for clear sailing in the weeks and months ahead 
to government regulators securities industry officials and just 
about anyone else with a stake in the wellbeing of the market the 
past week provided a pleasant surprise 
as the workweek began monday the street was braced for a 
possible replay of the crash of 1987 following the friday the 
13th massacre in which the dow jones industrial average fell 190 
points 
instead bluechip stocks began a rally that spread to many 
smaller secondary issues as the week progressed 
once the commotion began to die down many observers concluded 
stocks had simply experienced a sharp but short correction that 
had little bearing on either the outlook for the economy or 
longterm investment prospects 
maybe so say analysts now but even if it was only a 
coincidence the markets sudden drop came at a time when the trend 
in corporate profits was showing some early signs of weakening 
furthermore technical analysts have questioned whether it 
wasnt a bit too pat to chalk up the oct 13 decline as a handy 
catchup buying opportunity for investors who had missed out on the 
gains in stock prices earlier in the year 
it may be many weeks before we can fully understand the 
longterm impact of oct 13 on the us equity market said 
joseph barthel at hopper soliday amp co 
for now it suffices to say that serious technical damage to 
the longstanding uptrend has occurred 
there has been no notable revival lately on wall street of the 
recession fears so widely voiced at midsummer confidence has 
remained high that the economy can achieve a soft landing that 
provides the chance for renewed growth as 1990 passes 
still even a soft landing isnt painless observed edward 
kerschner and charles pradilla analysts at painewebber inc 
historically soft landings for the overall economy have been 
hard landings for profits 
forecasters arent calling for any drastic drop in earnings just 
now but many do contend that the strong gains of the past couple 
of years are giving way to a leveling off or moderate decline 
the thrill is gone from us corporate profits said abby 
joseph cohen an investment strategist at drexel burnham lambert 
inc profit growth has decelerated return on equity has peaked 
such cautionary notes didnt do much to dampen investors 
enthusiasm for markeddown merchandise in the stock market this 
past week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 21626 points the 
week before rebounded a record 11988 to 268914 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 656 to 19212 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
334 to 47063 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 388 at 38257 
volume on the big board averaged 23404 million shares a day 
against 16195 million the week before 
optimists on the market outlook say stocks can weather a 
temporary earnings decline if investors are able to see signs of a 
future revival of profit expansion 
subpar growth means negative earnings comparisons for cyclical 
companies acknowledged john connolly at dean witter reynolds inc 
but it would take more economic weakness than we are looking 
for to create a significant drop in overall corporate earnings

senate majority leader george j mitchell said 
friday he doubts congress will vote to cut capital gains this year 
president bush has been pressing hard for a capitalgains tax 
cut 
mitchell a maine democrat told reporters it is difficult to 
predict a vote on the issue because there is no certainty what type 
of capitalgains cut the senate will be considering 
sen bob packwood rore said thursday that he can count 55 to 
58 votes a majority for his own capitalgains proposal 
that is not necessarily in conflict with what mitchell said 
democrats most of whom stiffly oppose any cut in capitalgains 
taxes might filibuster against packwoods plan and it would take 
60 votes to shut off debate 
packwood and sen bill roth rdel are sponsoring a plan to 
exclude between 5 percent and 35 percent of capital gains from 
taxation depending on how long an asset was owned before it was 
sold the bill also would let workers set up individual retirement 
accounts that would allow taxfree withdrawals for medical 
expenses education homebuying or retirement 
the packwoodroth plan is backed by the bush administration the 
president also supports a lessambitious capitalgains cut that has 
been passed by the house over opposition of the democratic 
leadership 
mitchell a maine democrat said the packwoodroth plan raises 
real questions about fiscal responsibility 
tax benefits for iras are going to cost the same whether the 
benefits are provided at the time a contribution is made as under 
current law or when a withdrawal is made from an ira as packwood 
and roth are recommending mitchell said 
the only question is which generation is going to pay for 
it mitchell said 
the democratic leader took a swipe at bush for pressing so hard 
for the capitalgains cut that he promised in last years 
presidential campaign 
i would like to see the president devote as much time to 
presidential policy in response to historic events in western and 
eastern europe mitchell said id like to see him devote a 
fraction of the time to that that he is to this capitalgains 
debacle

at 240 pm on friday oct 13 the new york 
stock exchange halted trading in shares of ual corp on reports 
that a 675 billion buyout was collapsing 
instantly the news poisoned the market for stocks of other 
takeover targets if financing fizzled for the labormanagement 
takeover of united airlines parent what deal was safe 
by 3 pm the dow jones industrial average had tumbled 5697 
points panic spread through the hundreds of traders specialists 
and clerks on the floor of the threestory trading atrium 
every arb and his brother sold everything he could get his 
hands on said a major wall street arbitrager who dumped a large 
ual stake at a loss 
by days end the dow average declined 19058 points the 
secondlargest point drop in history and all thoughts turned to 
monday oct 19 1987 when the market crashed after a similar 
friday selloff 
in the 65 hours from fridays close to the markets opening 
monday unprecedented steps were taken to keep credit lines open 
promote postcrash safety measures and allay investors fears 
interviews with exchange leaders government officials and 
market professionals show that those steps all taken with 1987 in 
mind helped stop the friday the 13th selloff from becoming 
nightmare on wall street part ii 
it was knowing that the possible consequence of inaction could 
be so dire that we all had to act that way said ivers riley 
senior vice president at the american stock exchange 
the bounceback also suggested that leadership more than 
regulation proved the key to holding the markets together what 
prevented a second coronary officials said was not 
circuitbreaker trading halts but a determination to maintain 
calm so that orderly buying and selling even highvolume 
computerized trading could proceed 
the more progress we can make towards bringing the regulation 
into one place or to bring it into a high degree of coordination 
the better off were going to be at it treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said 
extraordinary action was evident everywhere from treasury 
department backrooms in washington to trading rooms at new york 
brokerages to suburban living rooms where executives mapped 
strategies while the world series played on tv 
after checking his bank credit line a veteran nyse specialist 
arranged 20 million in emergency financing from friends just in 
case of another black monday the specialist had to buy a 
remarkable 25 million of stock in 75 minutes friday doubling his 
normal daily inventory to fulfill his role as a market maker 
who ensures smooth trading 
treasury department federal reserve and securities and 
exchange commission officials analyzed fridays trading and 
telephoned important market participants we were at it all 
weekend one source said 
about 200 amex traders and officials gathered saturday to 
complete the paperwork on fridays hectic dealings nyse leaders 
called member firms and specialists to ensure they had adequate 
capital should the market collapse technicians checked computers 
that nyse officials had hailed for months as fully capable of 
handling enormous volumes 
retail brokerages opened offices in a broad campaign to ease 
fears executives at prudentialbache securities inc whose 6500 
brokers at 325 branch offices fielded client calls all weekend 
dictated the company line via the firms nationwide communications 
network this is not 1987 
despite those assurances the spooky similarities between friday 
the 13th and friday oct 16 1987 dominated everyones thinking 
fears about rising interest rates and the decline of the 1980s 
takeover boom played roles in both friday slides 
the market already was down about 25 points when the ual 
announcement hit arbitragers stock speculators who seek to 
profit on shortterm rises in takeover targets like ual exited 
quickly 
money managers for pension funds insurance companies and mutual 
funds followed some reported phone lines were so clogged they 
couldnt get orders in another black monday reminder 
you had a bandwagon psychology one nyse floor specialist 
said they became fearful for a repeat of the crash and you had a 
headlong retreat 
cramer amp co a new york firm that manages 20 million in 
assets reduced the stock segment of its portfolio from 35 percent 
to 10 percent joining a wave triggered by frantic selling of 
stockindex futures 
many professional trading strategies exploit the links between 
the stock market and contracts traded in the futures markets that 
are based on the future prices of large groups of stocks 
once the ual deal broke there were massive sell programs in 
futures said cramer president james j cramer 
hot lines among the major exchanges in new york and chicago 
installed after the 1987 crash were opened friday when the market 
began tumbling phone links also were established with washington 
after the close even the biggest firms checked with banks to 
ensure they had adequate capital and credit lines that could be 
expanded if necessary traders stayed late into the night 
dissecting what happened 
some wall street executives conferred in emergency sessions on 
saturday and sunday but panic wasnt apparent the president of 
one major brokerage attended family weekend at his daughters 
upstate new york college 
the firms whose longterm profitability depends on demand for 
stocks worked to control the damage at 530 pm friday for 
example merrill lynch amp co issued a statement aimed at soothing 
investors noting what it called the differences between 1989 and 
1987 
merrill and its competitors emphasized the economy was slowing 
and the dollar was strong vs october 1987 when the economy was 
growing sharply and the dollar weak shearson lehman hutton inc 
analysts compiled a list of stocks to recommend 
what we had to do was kind of say you should not overreact 
and liquidate positions the right thing to do is stay in there 
said richard sichenzio retail group president at prudentialbache 
still wall street feared two major possibilities investors 
would ignore the advice and overseas markets would react negatively 
to fridays selloff 
in an attempt to forestall those prospects a federal reserve 
official said saturday the fed would inject as much money as 
necessary into the banking system to avoid a crisis it was an 
extraordinary pronouncement by the fed which almost never 
discloses its intentions in 1987 the fed didnt act until after 
the crash 
nyseofficials meanwhile touted postcrash innovations designed 
to stem a market landslide including the circuit breakers that 
would halt trading temporarily in new york and chicago if prices 
sunk below certain levels 
on sunday night wall street strategists gathered to monitor the 
market opening in tokyo where it was monday morning the japanese 
market fell less than 2 percent and stabilized 
at morgan stanley amp co one of the biggest wall street 
brokerages equities divisions held a 6 am strategy session with 
linkups to london and tokyo 
i dont feel at all that this is a situation thats comparable 
to 1987 and that were looking at a big crash morgans chief 
strategist barton biggs told employees in an 815 am video and 
telephone hookup 
the new york market opened lower partly because stockindex 
futures prices in chicago tumbled and stock prices followed but a 
lack of selling by large institutions such as pension funds and 
insurance companies sent a positive signal 
when a major futures index suddenly turned upward so did the 
underlying bluechip stocks where bargains abounded like ibm at 
less than 100 a share the dow jones rallied finishing up 88 
points on the day and the crisis faded 
the absence of portfolio insurance a strategy blamed for 
accelerating the 1987 decline in stock and stockindex futures 
prices may have helped arrest another panic some professionals 
said but some forms of program trading were still very much in 
evidence 
in the end it may have been the fear of disaster that prevented 
one 
people certainly have a memory said joseph schmuckler a 
senior vice president at kidder peabody amp co they were a lot 
more concerned i think being very conscious of what happened two 
years ago was very positive

ltd which had provided about 110 million in capital to the 
american company over the past four years 
qintex entertainments chief financial officer john lloyd said

it would get the 59 million by the deadline thursday 
but at a board meeting wednesday qintex australia indicated it 
was unable or unwilling to help qintex america make the 
payment lloyd said 
the payment was related to a distribution deal involving mca 
inc and hal roach studios inc a qintex entertainment subsidiary 
the roach studios and qintex productions inc the companys other 
operating subsidiary also filed for protection from creditors 
under protection of federal bankruptcy law

faces in reviving a bid for mgmua the australian company had 
approached nbc and several foreign companies about helping finance 
the takeover 
qintex entertainment had been expected to be part of the 
emerging company but officials said they now envision qintex 
entertainment going its own way if it can successfully reorganize 
under protection from its creditors 
we think we have a very viable company here but we had to do 
this to protect our shareholders lloyd the chief financial 
officer said in a telephone interview 
we do not believe at this time that the company will require 
additional financing while in chapter 11 lloyd said 
he said production would continue on such programs as the 
syndicated sports and variety program roller games and a 
hallmark hall of fame twohour special starring walter matthau 
incident at lincoln bluff

year its other programs include kids incorporated in its
