an iraqi airways jetliner landed at 
gatwick airport late friday with more than 350 evacuees mostly 
american women and children who told of dwindling opposition by 
kuwaiti resistance fighters 
galina suliman a passenger from san francisco said kuwaiti 
groups were being systematically put down by the iraqis 
american andrea hanson who arrived on the uschartered boeing 
747 with her 5yearold son zach said kuwaiti resistance groups 
did not have enough weapons to fight the iraqis 
a british woman on the flight relayed one report of a group of 
16 kuwaitis being gunned down in the street by an iraqi soldier as 
they sat around chatting 
the british domestic news agency press association said there 
were believed to be 275 americans on board 43 canadians 26 
britons six japanese six australians two west germans and an 
unspecified number of indians syrians and filipinos 
however there was confusion about precise numbers press 
association initially reported 39 canadians were aboard 
an official at the us embassy in london said of the americans 
on the fight we havent got a final head count we are still 
processing 
an airport official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
passengers included some men 
the plane left baghdad on friday afternoon and landed at gatwick 
25 miles south of london about 1130 pm 
the airport official said 30 people due to fly to gatwick had 
instead been detained in baghdad because they could not clear iraqi 
exit formalities in time she did not give their nationalities 
sky news television said the women and children on the plane are 
believed to have been among the last who expressed a wish to leave 
behind their husbands and fathers in kuwait 
the iraqis have said they are keeping men as hostages to deter 
any foreign attack on iraq 
the americans who arrived friday were booked into hotels in and 
around gatwick for the night they were due to leave for 
baltimorewashington international airport on saturday afternoon 
the 26yearold british woman who declined to gave her name for 
fear it might jeopardize her husband left behind in kuwait said 
the 16 kuwaitis had been shot on a road near kuwait city they 
were just sitting around chatting we didnt talk about it too 
much it had a very bad effect on morale 
she added the iraqis are starting to seal areas they are 
looking for weapons they are looking for foreigners 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and later annexed the tiny 
oilrich neighbor 
the british woman said people living in kuwait were being 
restricted in what they could buy but iraqi soldiers were going 
into stores and taking all they wanted iraqis were also seizing 
jeeps and trucks she said 
ms hanson said that in recent days iraqi authorities had 
succeeded in partly quelling kuwaiti resistance 
resistance is very haphazard the iraqis are very successful 
at putting them down they havent got enough people they havent 
got enough weapons she said

a state lawmakers 20yearold son was 
convicted friday of intentionally killing his mother with a bow and 
arrow as jurors rejected his claim the death was accidental 
chad goetsch who testified that the hunting arrow slipped when 
his mothers voice startled him showed no emotion when the verdict 
was read he is the adopted son of state rep robert goetsch who 
testified against him 
the jury deliberated 4 hours before finding goetsch guilty of 
firstdegree intentional homicide he was also found guilty of 
endangering safety for injuries suffered by his father in a 
struggle 
circuit judge daniel klossner scheduled sentencing for oct 29 
goetsch faces a mandatory life term for the intentional homicide 
conviction 
the second charge arose from allegations he aimed another arrow 
at his father and fought with him after shooting his 51yearold 
mother carolyn the arrow pierced his mothers heart 
the killing took place after goetsch arrived at the family home 
in oak grove early nov 8 from his college residence 
the elder goetsch had testified that his son had threatened the 
mother 
we talked about buying a gun he said she started 
insisting on locking the doors she said she was afraid of him she 
was afraid he was going to kill her 
the younger goetsch testified thursday that he never meant to 
release the arrow but his mother startled him 
my whole body jerked and contracted and i lost control of the 
bow string he said he denied that he aimed another arrow at his 
father 
defense attorney henry conti said previous family conflicts 
described during the trial perhaps had an effect in the incident 
that morning im afraid it poured over to the jurys decision 
he said the verdict would be appealed 
the elder goetsch who was present when the verdict was read 
said the trial ended as it should but the outcome brought no 
relief 
justice has triumphed in this case but i feel bad 
terrible said goetsch who adopted chad at age 4 after marrying 
the boys mother

a model of a small nasa space taxi to 
shuttle crew and cargo between earth and an orbiting station was 
unveiled friday 
fiftyfive students from two universities designed the mockup 
of the spacecraft that would be launched by a titan 4 rocket and

small loads of cargo and people to and from the planned space 
station freedom 
it was unveiled on the north carolina state university campus 
students from both nc state and north carolina aampt state 
university worked on the vehicle 
the agreement with nasa was that we would do the structural 
design and construct the working model said nc state aerospace 
engineering professor fred dejarnette they provided the external 
shape the computer geometry of the vehicle 
the university is home to the mars mission research center 
nasas goal is to reach mars by 2019 and scientists say a working

convicted felons dont usually appear on 
their own television specials 
but a 56yearold tucson real estate speculator had the dubious 
distinction starring in niles thim conditions of probation a 
star sad to say was not born 
this is boring one of the investorvictims in the studio 
audience complained 
the judge who ordered the halfhour program said it was intended 
to educate and warn viewers about the consequences of what a 
proper or prudent investment would be 
the show substituting locally for new attitude in the abc 
affiliate kguns 830 pm slot friday was part of a creative 
sentence imposed by pima county superior court judge lawrence 
fleischman as a condition of thims probation 
during the sept 6 taping thims attorney robert hirsh 
objected frequently to questions that he insisted amounted to an 
inquisition a pillory 
under a negotiated agreement thim pleaded guilty in january to 
three felony counts of selling unregistered securities the 
securities were mortgages on raw land 
im hopeful that people at the very least can be forewarned 
about looking before leaping into investments fleischman said 
friday i think it fulfilled part of the function i dont think 
it was perfect its never been done before and we were all 
treading on new grounds 
thim also must repay 92 million to 112 investors and serve 
four years probation and one year in jail he has served part of 
the term and faces four more jail stays annually during the 
thanksgivingthroughnew years holiday season 
authorities have estimated that more than 600 investors in 18 
states lost at least 25 million in real estate investments with 
thim who failed to register the transactions with the arizona 
corporation commission and did not prepare offering memoranda as 
state law required 
the halfhour program was taped before a studio audience that 
included some of the investor victims it made for 
lessthangripping television some of the audience walked out 
before the end 
during the taping hirsh thim atchley and jerry goddard a 
former county attorneys investigator sat before the cameras in a 
talkshow setting the agreedto format limited the questions thim 
could be asked principally by kgun anchor guy atchley to dealing 
with the three counts to which thim had pleaded 
only one investor ina bartenslager was allowed to ask a 
question oncamera 
fleischman and howard fell a pima county deputy prosecutor who 
handled thims case also attended the taping which was 
interrupted frequently by objections from hirsh to questions 
pitched toward thim 
i thought it was probably worthless from the perspective of 
fulfilling any of the real functions of probation hirsh said 
he contended that most of the questioning was accusatory 
directed to whether thim was a good guy or a bad guy i think 
they totally missed what i perceived was the whole point of all of 
this 
fell was out of town friday and could not be reached for 
comment 
hirsh had succeeded through a court appeal in getting fleischman 
to change the name of the show from niles thim how i stole 92 
million he objected that thim didnot steal 9 million and did 
not plead to such a charge 
mrs bartenslager representing investors who lost money with 
thim said she and her deceased husband had lost more than 30000 
invested with thim proceeds from an automobile accident and that 
she had been forced to put her house up for sale 
thim said he sympathized with her but that she had made money 
through his investments over the years 
he also said several times that payments to the investors have 
simply been delayed and that he hopes to repay all within two 
years thim has filed for bankruptcy and his properties are being 
sold off 
thim blamed his problems on the savings and loan debacle which 
depreciated arizona land values on the 1986 tax changes he also 
said he relied too much on real estate investments and recommended 
that investors own their own property 
said fleischman it will be worthwhile if one person who was 
about to make an investment stops and thinks then it will have 
achieved what it was set out to achieve

justo enrique dellosas trip from kuwait to 
queen alia airport took 22 days along the road his fiancee died 
of the heat then he was one of the faceless thousands stranded in 
the jordan desert 
it was terrible dellosa said shaking his head at the 
inadequacy of the word but not finding a better one terrible 
he sat on the curb friday with 50 filipino friends awaiting an 
evacuation flight to manila nearby a young man hugged his 
girlfriend who wept silently a group of others joked and laughed 
chased out of kuwait by hunger and fear after iraqs aug 2 
invasion they did not know what to expect back home 
dellosa said his friends had gone to the gulf for work they 
could not find in the philippines nearly a million foreigners 
many of them citizens of impoverished asian countries had come 
for the same reason hundreds of thousands have begun tortuous 
trips home in the last six weeks 
ill find something maybe dellosa said looking dubious 
his last possessions were within reach stuffed into a cheap 
suitcase his pockets held a few dollars worth of iraqi dinars 
as an office boy in kuwait he earned 450 a month for four 
years he fed a bank account to pay for a trip to the united states 
for a shot at the american dream 
i have an auntie and two uncles in california he said 
also an auntie in new mexico you know where that is 
but iraqi authorities froze all kuait bank accounts they 
searched dellosa at the border and shook him down for a few 
electronics items he might have sold for a small stake 
dellosas parents live in manila but with four daughters and 
three other sons they have scant means to provide for a destitute 
27yearold son 
the filipinos plight was shared by the 12000 to 15000 asians 
who mob the airport each day to get onto the dozens of special 
flights home on friday ragged lines of indians bangladeshis and 
sri lankans snaked out of terminal 2 each slight movement touched 
off a mad scramble among people terrified of being left behind 
dellosa and his financee thelma cajayon left kuwait early aug 
23 in a taxi with two others the driver left off the air 
conditioning afraid of overheating the car in the blasting sun 
after 11 hours on the road only 60 miles from baghdad thelma 
collapsed from the heat revived she went into convulsions from 
nervous anxiety 
we got her to a doctor but it was a small provincial 
hospital dellosa said they could not do anything 
after her death he pressed on with his friends a day later 
they crossed out of iraq besieged by refugees jordanian 
authorities held the newcomers in a no mans land without admitting 
them to jordan fate landed dellosa in shaalan ii a tent camp with 
water tanks and a clinic it was a luxury next to the filthy 
squalor of shaalan i where refugees with no shelter battled for 
food and water 
but the same heat and dust beat down on both camps with 
bonechilling cold at night refugees tried to sleep on sharp rocks 
infested by scorpions and snakes day and night they were 
tormented with fear and confusion none knew when their consulates 
might find enough airplanes to get them home 
for 22 days dellosa and his friends paced in the sun and tried 
to keep up their health 
we ate sardines some tomatoes arabic bread he said at 
the end they gave us only some kind of corned beef with hair from 
the cow still in it 
eventually buses took the refugees to another camp outside of 
amman from there three days later they were at the airport 
prodded by questions dellosa reflected on his ordeal 
i suppose i am happy to be going he said but i left my 
girlfriend behind and my whole life in kuwait they destroyed our 
futures all of our dreams they are nightmares

the snarling guard dogs that patrolled the 
berlin wall held back east germans yearning to breathe free in the 
west but they also kept an unwelcome visitor at bay the rabid 
fox 
when the wall came down dozens of the diseaseridden creatures 
began scampering into west berlin reintroducing a dreaded ailment 
that had been virtual eradicated 
since the wall crumbled last november 37 rabid foxes have been 
found in west berlin including one at a crowded swimming pool 
about 10 people have been bitten according to west berlin health 
department spokesman thomaspeter gallon 
the fall of the borders with east germany not only led to 
people moving freely but also foxes gallon said before 
rabies had been virtually wiped out 
surrounding east germany has been slow in combating rabies 
health officials said although no statistics on rabies cases in 
the east were available 
west berliners have been thrown into a minor panic by the rabies 
outbreak police have even issued warnings over radio and by 
loudspeakers from a van 
doctors have cautioned against alarm but warn bite victims to 
seek shots to stop the disease which can be fatal if untreated 
the savage guard dogs once posted along border crossings scared 
away foxes as well as people said gallon in the case of the 
foxes just the scent of the dogs was enough to keep them way 
when the wall and other border barriers came down the dogs were 
retired and the foxes found they could dash over the crumbling wall 
and into the west 
in addition to the 37 rabid foxes west berlin officials have 
found six other rabid animals since nov 9 
during the preceding 10 months there were only three rabid 
animals found in west berlin none of them foxes no one was 
bitten gallon said 
he estimated it could take up to a year to bring rabies back 
under control adding the real fear is that it could spread to dogs 
and cats 
west berlin officials have issued a public appeal for pet owners 
to be sure their beloved dogs and cats are immunized local 
veterinarians have offered special prices to help with the program 
rabies getting worse screamed the headline of the daily 
berliner morgenpost on friday now a dog is the victim of the 
disease 
the newspaper said the dog presumably bitten by a rabid fox 
had become the first pet with the disease in west berlin in five 
years another recent article said a 70yearwoman was attacked by 
a fox in a city park 
with the berlin wall opening it really went up said dr 
christian schoenfeld a leading immunologist involved in rabies 
treatment the wall was definitely a barrier 
gallon calls the rabies outbreak one of the small unavoidable 
disadvantages of the walls opening west berlin officials are 
already working with the east germans to curb the threat he said 
west germany like many western countries has had great success 
over the years by using bait laden with an immunizing substance to 
eliminate the rabies virus in the wild animal population 
schoenfeld who at one point interrupted an interview to answer 
a coworkers anxious query about rabies cautioned against 
overreaction he noted that antirabies injections are given in the 
arm now rather than the painful stomach injections administered in 
the past

the violence claiming scores 
of lives every week in south africa threatens efforts to end 
apartheid and is pushing the country into what some fear will be 
civil war 
optimism generated earlier this year by president fw de 
klerks steps to end white rule is fading rival black factions are 
feuding for power white extremists vow to fight any effort to end 
apartheid and the violence is creating mistrust on all sides 
growing numbers of whites and blacks fear the country is 
hurtling out of control white and black leaders warn they wont be 
able to end apartheid if there is no peace or trust between ethnic 
groups 
de klerk warned friday that growing violence was undermining the 
governments efforts to share power between whites and blacks and 
find a way for the two groups live together peacefully 
the new south africa which is the goal of all sincere south 
africans is being threatened by present events he said 
chris hani leader of the african national congress military 
wing said south africa is already in a state of undeclared 
war 
almost 800 people have been killed since august in the black 
townships that ring johannesburg people have been butchered on 
trains burned to death in their homes and hacked to death in the 
streets 
more than everything in my life i want this fighting to stop 
i havent slept for days every night i hear gunfire and shouting 
and whistles sometimes i get messages that they are coming said 
boxer ngwenga a township resident 
despite calls from white and black leaders for peace the 
violence shows no sign of ending the reasons for the fighting are 
numerous and complex 
much of the fighting pits zulus aligned to the conservative 
inkatha party against xhosas and other blacks linked to the anc 
rivalry between inkatha and the anc has cost more than 5000 
lives in natal province in recent years and the power struggle has 
intensified and broadened with the government promise to end white 
rule political analysts say 
the anc and inkatha disagree over plans for a future south 
africa with the nationalistic zulu group favoring conservative 
policies including a capitalist economy the nontribal anc talks 
about compulsory redistribution of wealth and leftleaning programs 
to end poverty 
but the violence in the townships has become increasingly 
chaotic with armed men attacking strangers for no discernible 
reason fear appears to be fueling the violence prompting people 
to kill before they are killed 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi has repeatedly offered to 
meet nelson mandela the ancs deputy chief to negotiate an end to 
the violence the anc has refused accusing buthelezi of using the 
fighting to get a meeting with mandela and enhance his stature as a 
national leader 
in any case the anc and inkatha acknowledge they have many 
young followers they cannot control and its unclear whether a 
meeting would stop the fighting 
the anc contends the police are provoking the violence in an 
attempt to wreck peace talks and preserve apartheid townships are 
filled with stories of mysterious white men leading attacks 
the government and the police have denied the charges but many 
analysts believe some of the violence is organized possibly by 
rogue elements in the security services determined to preserve 
white rule at any price 
white extremists fear the end of apartheid would mean their 
destruction whites they claim would be submerged by the black 
masses and violence and anarchy would sweep the country 
the violence so far has had little impact on white south 
africans it has been confined to black townships and the only 
white casualties have been a few police officers 
government officials and others worry about what could happen if 
whites are dragged into the fighting most whites have guns and 
even a minor incident could spark a confrontation with blacks 
chances of peace seem to be getting slimmer as the violence 
spreads how political leaders ask privately can people at each 
others throats hope to live in peace and racial equality

one week before the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
the state department refused to allow the voice of america to 
broadcast an editorial critical of president saddam husseins 
threats the department cited concerns that the editorial would 
anger saddam sources say 
the case is the latest indication that some administration 
officials and congressional leaders either misread saddams 
intentions in the months preceding the invasion or believed he 
could be talked out of them 
a week before the aug 2 invasion us ambassador april glaspie 
was quoted as telling saddam that the united states understood his 
need for money to rebuild iraq after its eightyear war with iran 
we understand that and our opinion is you should have the 
opportunity to rebuild your country but we have no opinion on the 
arabarab conflicts like your border disagreement with kuwait 
ms glaspie is quoted as telling saddam 
her comments were echoed in subsequent days by officials in 
washington 
three months earlier four senate leaders met with saddam and 
assured him the united states wanted to improve relations with his 
country in response to questioning by the group led by senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas saddam acknowledged he had 
chemical weapons and was working on a nuclear bomb 
dole assured saddam that president bush would reject attempts in 
congress to impose sanctions on iraq and might even veto them 
according to a transcript of the meeting which was taped by iraq 
without the senators knowledge 
the meeting was supposed to be private we were prevented from 
taping it but the room was bugged said doles spokesman walt 
riker who attended the april 12 meeting 
riker said the iraqi transcript was doctored to excise comments 
by saddam that agreed with us positions 
iraq also provided a transcript of the meeting with ambassador 
glaspie the state department declined to say whether it accurately 
reflected her remarks 
analysts say iraq has circulated the transcripts in an attempt 
to show that saddam did not have any indication the united states 
would object so strongly to his invasion of kuwait 
dole rejected saddams claim that the administration was leading 
a campaign against iraq on the contrary dole said a voa 
commentator who had written a critical editorial about saddam two 
months earlier was fired 
in fact the commentator was not fired riker said friday that 
dole had been misinformed by the state department 
sources say voa was sharply reprimanded for the feb 15 
editorial which said democracy requires the dismantling of secret 
police services in such countries as north korea iran libya cuba 
and iraq 
the sources also say the same editorialialist wrote the july 25 
editorial the state department refused to clear 
all voa editorials have to be cleared by the radios parent 
agency the us information agency and in the case of sensitive 
topics by the state department 
we were asked to refrain from muddying the waters as long as 
diplomatic efforts were underway in the arab world to resolve the 
crisis said a state department official of the decision to stop 
the editorial 
in the days before the invasion egypt jordan and other arab 
countries were trying through diplomacy to prevent saddam from 
fulfilling his threats 
this is all mondaymorning quarterbacking riker said of 
those who say the united states should have known better than to 
try and pacify saddam 
he said the senate group went to iraq in an attempt to find out 
saddams intentions and to warn him that he would have to improve 
his behavior if he wanted better ties with washington 
but the iraqi transcript of the meeting paints a somewhat 
different picture 
after listening to you for about an hour i realize you are a 
strong and an intelligent man and that you want peace sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio is quoted as saying 
and sen alan simpson rwyoming told saddam his problem was 
with the western media not with the us government the press 
is spoiled and conceited he is quoted as saying my advice is 
that you allow these bastards to come here and see things for 
themselves 
simpsons spokesman stan cannon said the senator was a 
wellknown advocate of press freedom and that his comments were 
taken out of context 
saddam is just trying to embarrass him cannon said

three senior members of a 
whitesupremacist group have been convicted of more than 100 
offenses committed in an 18month terrorism campaign against 
asians 
a perth district court jury on friday found the men guilty of 
conspiring to drive asians out of western australia state with a 
series of tactics including arson attacks on perth chinese 
restaurants 
they also carried out a string of thefts to fund the movement 
which reportedly has offshoots in other states 
two defendants argued they were patriotic australians fighting 
for their country 
a former member of the group who had testified against the 
defendants received plastic surgery and was given a new identity 
overseas 
judge kevin hammond planned sentencing hearings on separate days 
next week

the united states is relying on un 
diplomatic backing in the persian gulf but ignoring the world 
bodys military potential 
instead us officials are trying to resurrect a middle east 
military alliance 
washington wants moscow to help blunt iraqi aggression 
ironically the earlier middle east alliance was the 1955 baghdad 
pact later called cento in which america allied with iraq against 
the soviet union 
cento unraveled in 1959 when iraq dropped out after 
revolutionaries overthrew the countrys monarchy 
in his effort to forge a new alliance president bush has urged 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev to send ships or troops to join 
the usled multinational force in the gulf 
but gorbachev has refused the soviets say they will only send 
troops as part of a un command under the direction of the 
security councils military staff committee that committee 
consists of officers from the united states soviet union britain 
france and china the five permanent council members 
the military staff committee has never been activated to 
coordinate or monitor any un military operation however even 
the korean war un command was primarily under us control with 
some allied troops pitching in 
on sept 4 secretary of state james a baker iii told congress 
the united states needs a new regional security structure in 
the middle east to deter iraqi aggression the way nato checked the 
soviets in europe 
saudi arabia bahrain oman qatar and the united arab emirates 
are the likely partners in the alliance which has yet to take 
shape 
in the process baker bypassed the united nations the world 
body already has more than 10000 military observers and 
peacekeepers in various global hot spots though the united states 
and soviet union have not contributed troops to those forces 
why has washington ignored the uns military potential 
an official at the us mission to the united nations speaking 
on condition of anonymity said thursday that activating the 
military staff committee is being explored but it will be a very 
long and slow process 
the un ambassadors of the united states soviet union 
britain france and china held two private meetings with top 
military officers from their countries flown in from washington 
for the talks 
the us mission official said the military staff committee 
could begin receiving reports on the naval enforcement of the 
unordered embargo on iraq from the united states and other 
nations involved 
this skeletal structure can now begin to grow he said 
secretary of defense dick cheney said he has no objection in 
principle to us participation in an international military 
operation however cheney said he could not imagine breaking the 
constitutional chain of command that leads up to bush as 
commanderinchief 
the pentagon of course would object vehemently to the notion 
of putting us personnel under international authority rep les 
aspin dwis said sept 7 at a gulf policy seminar 
aspin however said bush should consider the idea of a un 
command structure 
ed luck president of the un association of the usa said 
one could easily meld the idea of a regional security system with 
the un charter and with the military staff committee 
his group is a private organization that studies us policy 
toward the world body it generally advocates more active american 
involvement in the united nations 
with more un peacekeeping operations looming in the western 
sahara in africa and cambodia it is time to revive the un 
committee as a coordinating group luck added

the un security council overwhelmingly 
voted late thursday to allow food shipments to iraq and occupied 
kuwait only to relieve human suffering and said relief agencies 
must distribute the aid 
the wording of the resolution which passed 132 sought to 
maintain the narrow restrictions under which aid could be sent in 
line with a resolution passed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the council rejected an alternative cubansponsored resolution 
that would have opened the door to unlimited food shipments to the 
estimated 19 million people in iraq and kuwait including hundreds 
of thousands of foreigners trapped by the invasion 
cuba and yemen voted against the resolution 
the united states soviet union britain france finland and 
canada sponsored the resolution also voting in favor were china 
colombia ethiopia ivory coast malaysia romania and zaire 
under security council resolution 661 passed four days after 
iraqs invasion only medical supplies may be sent to iraq or 
kuwait or in humanitarian circumstances foodstuffs 
india and the philippines however have appealed to the 
security councils sanctions committee for permission to send food 
to their people still stranded in iraq and kuwait 
iraq has said it will not feed the 140000 indians 93000 sri 
lankans and 60000 filipinos it holds but that they must rely on 
their governments 
the resolution passed thursday said the international committee 
of the red cross or other appropriate humanitarian agencies 
should distribute the food or supervise its distribution 
that left open the possibility that the iraqi red crescent one 
of the moslem national charities that are members of the icrc 
might be allowed to handle food distribution 
the five permanent security council members had said earlier 
thursday that food shipments should be allowed into iraq and 
occupied kuwait to relieve human suffering the permanent 
council members are the united states soviet union britain 
france and china 
iraqi ambassador abdul alanbari said wednesday that only 
iraqi authorities could distribute food in his country 
the full 15member council was ready to adopt it thursday night 
when the ambassador from yemen the only arab nation on the 
council suddenly left the closeddoor meeting 
cuba and yemen had been pushing a separate resolution with a 
very board definition of humanitarian circumstances that would have 
allowed unlimited shipments of basic foodstuffs to feed the iraqi 
civilian population 
if the security councils committee on sanctions decides there 
is an urgent humanitarian need to supply foodstuffs to iraq or 
kuwait in order to relieve human suffering it can recommend the 
council allow such aid to be sent the resolution said 
alanbari also has rejected the idea of un experts 
investigating the food situation in his country 
also thursday night the councils committee on sanctions was 
expected to approve indias request to send a ship loaded with 22 
million pounds of food to kuwait to feed 140000 indians stranded 
in that country and iraq 
in addition to finland the other members of the council are 
algeria brazil canada colombia ethiopia malaysia nepal 
senegal and yugoslavia

sharon pratt dixon is a political unknown but 
the woman who is favored to become the next mayor of the nations 
capital is hardly a political novice 
the probable successor to marion barry dixon scored a stunning 
victory tuesday in the citys democratic primary her first bid for 
public office 
she didnt have the kind of money in the primary to put out 
those television commercials this is sharon pratt dixon and this 
is who i am said julius hobson a longtime observer of city 
politics 
but it would be a mistake to call her a political newcomer 
she doesnt have a real daytoday record but she does have a long 
involvement in local and national politics said hobson 
she was short on cash staff and supplies but dixons theme 
throughout the primary campaign was that the time had come to get 
rid of the bloated bureaucracy and inefficiency associated with 
barrys administration 
while her message had become familiar on election day voters in 
this city of 620000 still know little about the 46yearold 
divorced mother of two or the depth of her political experience 
a former treasurer of the democratic national committee dixon 
learned how to run a citywide campaign when she managed former 
carter aide patricia roberts harris unsuccessful effort to defeat 
barry in the districts 1982 primary 
and when she made her victory speech tuesday dnc chairman ron 
brown chose to stand by her side 
dixon is also an old friend of virginia gov douglas wilder who 
fashioned his own underdog campaign last year in becoming the old 
dominions first black governor 
if elected in november she would break new ground herself 
becoming the first black woman to serve as mayor of a major 
american city 
shes no stranger to congress which reviews the annual city 
budget and frequently takes a more critical look when things arent 
going well for the local government within hours of her victory 
she had set up a meeting with senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine 
the citys image on capitol hill badly tarnished by barrys 
drug conviction and the local governments 93 million deficit 
already seems to be regaining some of its luster 
im a very optimistic person and a very determined person 
dixon said wen asked to describe herself i dont take no for an 
answer very easily 
those who know the slight bespectacled woman agree 
shes always been a very aggressive person eager to prove 
herself said her aunt aimee pratt i remember when she was a 
little girl and she would be climbing on a chair or something i 
would tell her not to and she would say but i can i can 
her business resume is lengthy too an attorney she rose 
through the ranks at the potomac electric power co to become 
director of the utilitys consumer affairs department before 
launching her longshot mayoral campaign 
shes a very warm dynamic intelligent person said w reid 
thompson pepco board chairman she is very relaxed with people 
and she shows a lot of poise and charm 
shes really succeeded in the mainstream of politics and in 
the business world said eddie williams director of the joint 
center for political studies a blackoriented think tank shes 
a technician very good with numbers her background is more 
corporate than civil rights 
dixon has taught at the university of the district of columbias 
law school worked on a commission that took authority over the 
citys criminal code from congress and gave it to the city council 
and served in a variety of legal posts at pepco 
and while voters responded to dixons repeated sometimes 
strident calls for cuts in the city work force and elimination of 
other forms of cronyism those familiar with her believe there is 
another side to her 
something people dont see is that she is very gentle not 
aloof at all her aunt said you have to get to know her but 
once you do shes very approachable and warm 
it wasnt until after barry was convicted of a cocaine 
possession charge less than a month before the primary that 
city residents started paying attention to dixon she scored a 
major coup two weeks later when the washington post endorsed her 
over four rivals with longtime ties to city government 
democrats outnumber republicans here by a 9to1 margin so 
dixon appears headed for victory nov 6 against gop candidate 
maurice turner a former city police chief

us negotiators in the philippines are likely 
to propose a 10year phaseout of us bases with a possible 
commercial agreement for limited use of the facilities afterward a 
congressman said late thursday 
if the position is taken it will be the first time the us 
government has been willing to discuss a withdrawal from clark air 
base and subic navy base two of its largest overseas facilities 
rep stephen solarz chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said he has talked with 
administration officials involved in the talks to open next week in 
manila 
the washington post citing congressional and administration 
sources reported in its friday editions that the united states was 
considering the phaseout 
state department spokesman martin judge said he could not 
comment on the post report or comments by solarz dny 
richard armitage head of the us negotiating team was en 
route to manila 
the us government has given no details of exactly where or 
when the talks will be taking place in manila citing security 
concerns a series of bombings blamed on either right or leftwing 
rebel opponents of president corazon aquino have shaken the city in 
recent weeks and there have been threats against americans 
the agreement under which the bases are used by us armed 
forces expires next year 
solarz in a telephone interview said he has had discussions 
with us negotiators about the possibility of a 10year phaseout 
and other positions the team might take 
i have the impression that this is a timetable they are 
comfortable with and likely to propose solarz said 
the congressman who is well known in the philippines for his 
interest in the country said the position recognizes the fact that 
we cannot persuade the filipinos to let us stay indefinitely but 
could conceivable persuade them to allow use of the bases for 
another decade 
he said the idea would be that if us and philippine 
authorities feel a us military presence is needed beyond that 
the us government could have access to the bases which already 
are technically owned by the philippines on a commercial basis 
paying for their use 
current agreements call for unlimited us use of the facilities 
based on an aid package that congress has trimmed below levels 
agreed upon between the two countries negotiators

iraq warned thursday of possible terrorist attacks against us 
forces sounding the theme of arab feelings wounded by the presence 
of nonmoslem soldiers massed in the holy lands of saudi arabia 
but a convocation of moslem clergy in mecca saudi arabia 
condemned the iraqi annexation of kuwait and said the usled 
multinational forces presence was justified by iraqs invasion 
late thursday the un security council voted 132 to allow 
food shipments to iraq and occupied kuwait only to relieve human 
suffering and said relief agencies must distribute the aid 
cuba and yemen the only arab nation on the council voted 
against the resolution which was sponsored by the united states 
the soviet union and four other countries 
meanwhile in tokyo the japanese government announced friday 
that it will provide an additional 3 billion in aid to more than 
1 billion already promised to assist peacekeeping forces in the 
persian gulf region and nations suffering from the unsponsored 
embargo against iraq 
members of the us congress had complained japan was not doing 
more in the crisis and had not contributed enough in light of its 
high dependence on middle east oil iraq and kuwait possess 20 
percent of the worlds oil reserves second only to saudi arabia 
chief government spokesman misoji sakamoto said japans 
increased contribution was not in response to us demands but was 
his countrys contribution to the world based on the united 
nations resolutions we are not only listening to what the 
united states says 
sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum japan 
could provide at this point 
in another development the us commander in saudi arabia said 
the flow of equipment for american forces into saudi arabia was 
eight days behind schedule the commander though said the troops 
and military hardware already there were sufficient enough to stop 
any iraqi attack 
iraqs warning came in a memorandum to the us charge 
daffaires in baghdad according to the iraqi news agency 
monitored in nicosia cyprus it said iraq was responding to a us 
claim that iraqbased terrorists were preparing to attack us 
targets 
the united states is creating a pretext for aggression the 
memorandum was quoted as saying and iraq reserves its legitimate 
right to selfdefense to reciprocate and to retaliate firmly 
against these parties if it becomes a target 
president bush should expect that the crimes the united states 
of america is committing against the arab nation and the insult it 
is directing to the islamic shrines by occupying holy lands will 
undoubtedly produce a natural reaction from the arab and islamic 
masses said the memorandum 
ina said the us claims were contained in a note delivered 
wednesday to the foreign ministry in baghdad 
in washington state department officials said us diplomats in 
baghdad told iraqi authorities wednesday night that the united 
states would hold them accountable for any terrorist attacks on 
americans 
a us official said american intelligence has indications 
terrorist groups based in iraq have begun planning for possible 
actions against various targets not only american but also of 
allied arab countries 
all us intelligence gathering posts are on a high state of 
alert the official said all the us officials spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in the past us officials have noted that two palestinian 
leaders linked to terrorist acts george habash and mohammed abbas 
have their headquarters in baghdad 
secretary of state james a baker iii flew to damascus on 
thursday to try to reinforce us cooperation with syria against 
iraq its longtime enemy 
meanwhile more than 300 moslem religious scholars and preachers 
from the saudifunded moslem world league issued a declaration 
after a meeting that ended wednesday they condemned saddams 
annexation of kuweit as unislamic 
the mecca declaration said the invasion of kuwait and the 
massing of iraqi troops on saudi borders are enough islamic 
reason to justify the presence of nonmoslem forces for saudi 
arabias defense 
moslems should not attack or commit any felonies against each 
other the declaration said within these rulings iraqs 
invasion and occupation of kuwait is against the principles of 
islam 
saddam last month attacked the saudi monarchs for inviting in 
the americans saying their presence sullied the holy sites of 
mecca and medina ayatollah ali khamenei irans spiritual leader 
echoed saddams statement on wednesday in a further sign iran and 
iraq may be entering an alliance of convenience following their 
eightyear war which ended in 1988 
oil experts said thursday that irans reported foodforoil deal 
with iraq could allow tehran to earn nearly 2 billion more a year 
by eliminating its other oil imports and boosting exports sources 
have said iran agreed to send food and medicine to baghdad in 
exchange for 200000 barrels of oil per day 
pierre terzian editor of the parisbased newsletter 
petrostrategies said iran probably could supply enough food to 
the right people and places to keep the iraqi economy going for 
awhile 
irans oil refineries were damaged during the war so the 
iranians have been importing 150000 barrels a day paid for in 
scarce foreign currency 
kayhan international a tehran newspaper said thursday that 
recently improved ties would allow the two countries to safeguard 
the areas tranquility and also prevent the influence and 
domination of foreign forces in the persian gulf 
the tehran times which reflects government thinking on 
wednesday denied tehran had agreed to provide food and medicine to 
iran state department spokesman richard boucher said the united 
states believes iran will uphold the unimposed embargo of iraq 
ambassador marjatta rasi of finland head of the un security 
council sanctions committee said iraq already was feeling the 
pinch from the trade embargo she said iraq had plenty of 
foodstuffs stockpiled but was withholding food from foreigners 
the un security council vote sought to maintain the narrow 
circumstances under which aid could be sent in line with a 
resolution passed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 but cuba 
yemen and some nonaligned nations insist food should be allowed in 
under much broader circumstances 
differences also have surfaced between the united states and its 
allies over how to pay for the troop deployments in the region and 
related costs such as feeding refugees and reimbursing countries 
whose economies suffer as a result of the embargo of iraq 
earlier thursday japans government rejected plans by the us 
house of representatives to link support for us troops in japan 
to tokyos contribution to the mideast peace effort 
the house voted wednesday to demand japan pay for the 50000 
us troops stationed on its soil under a security treaty the 
united states currently pays threefifths of the 74 billion 
annual bill 
we have been doing our best for the effective implementation 
of the japanus security treaty and we will continue to do so in 
the future sakamoto said in a tokyo news conference but quite 
logically they are two separate matters 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who also has been criticized 
in congress for not helping the us effort enough promised 
thursday to lend a helping hand though he did not whether the 
germans would provide money 
in an interview at us forces headquarters in riyadh commander 
general h norman schwarzkopf said the infusion of armored units 
the next two months will provide a 100 percent chance of 
winning any battle with iraqi forces 
however he said he was confident his forces would stop an iraqi 
attack now despite logistical problems that have put the 
deployment eight days behind

supreme court nominee david h souter in 
style and substance early in his senate confirmation hearings is 
proving what he had to hes no robert h bork 
souter who spent many hours watching videotapes of borks 1987 
performance is using his appearance before the senate judiciary 
committee to distance himself from the lingering memory of borks 
defeated high court nomination 
to many bork the senate witness seemed a bloodless academic who 
talked about the intellectual feast supreme court service would 
provide he sometimes bristled at pointed questions and ignored 
some softballs pitched by sympathetic senators 
in contrast many of souters responses thursday were 
embellished with personal anecdotes and he has won praise from two 
committee members for being a listener 
the bork thing was extraordinary in its intensity in what 
occurred sen alan simpson rwyo said at one point i dont 
see any portent of that here 
because too little is known about souters views on key 
constitutional issues he has not had to face the charges of 
extremism that dogged bork but souter a 50yearold new hampshire 
bachelor with an ascetic lifestyle is working hard to dispel any 
notion that he leads a life of disengaged isolation 
at one point he playfully complained about a senators cutting 
short one of his questions youre going to turn me into a 
laconic yankee if you keep doing that souter said 
after sen edward kennedy dmass pointed to several positions 
souter took as a state official and suggested that he was less than 
sensitive to minorities struggle for civil rights simpson put it 
to the nominee bluntly david souter are you a racist 
it was the type of question bork might have dismissed with a 
simple no 
but after responding the answer is no souter went on to 
deliver a moving soliloquy that left the usually loquacious simpson 
at a temporary loss for words 
souter recalled that he never heard his parents refer to any 
human being in racial or ethnic terms i am glad i am conditioned 
by my beginnings he said and i am glad i do not have to 
overcome them 
as the large hearing room grew increasingly silent souter 
talked about the discrimination is longtime friend sen warren 
rudman rnh knew as a young jewish boy and the biases that 
stung the irish grandparents of thomas rath a concord lawyer and 
another longtime friend 
there was no such similar moment during the record five days 
that bork testified before the committee three years ago 
bork never let his senate questioners make him embrace the 
notion that the constitution although it doesnt say so 
specifically provides a general right of privacy 
souter although no doubt a conservative endorsed such a 
constitutional right the one on which the supreme courts roe vs 
wade decision legalizing abortion is based 
he distanced himself from the doctrine of original intent 
in which judges seek to discover what the framers of a 
constitutional provision wanted it to mean when it was written 
instead souter said constitutional provisions must be 
interpreted in todays world a position more identified with 
retired justice william j brennan the liberal souter seeks to 
replace 
as an example souter praised the supreme courts 1954 ruling 
that outlawed racially segregated public schools it was based on a 
constitutional amendment adopted in 1868 when separation of the 
races was strictly enforced by numerous laws 
sen dennis deconcini dariz cited the nominees comments on 
that 1954 ruling to highlight the difference between souter and 
certain unnamed past nominees the senator clearly had concluded 
that no clone of robert h bork sat before him

higher oil prices from the tensions in 
the persian gulf have opened a rift in the governing party over 
swedens plan to abolish nuclear power in 20 years 
at least half the delegates to the social democratic party 
congress which begins saturday want to postpone the nuclear 
shutdown recent polls show 
about 25 percent of swedens total energy and 50 percent of 
its electricity come from nuclear power 
the opinion over when to abolish nuclear power is divided 
within the party swedens prime minister ingvar carlsson said to 
the news agency tt last week 
in 1980 a year after the three mile island nuclear accident in 
pennsylvania swedes voted to start shutting down their nuclear 
energy plants in 1995 
oil has been viewed as the most likely alternative to nuclear 
power but the surge in price after iraqs invasion of kuwait on 
aug 2 has reminded swedes of how much their plan could cost the 
price of gasoline in sweden is already among the highest in the 
world mostly because of taxes a gallon costs about 5 
to cut the nuclear power at a fast pace we would be forced to 
use oil as an energy source in the meantime nuclear power is 
relatively inexpensive compared to the high oil prices 
acknowledged bertil karlberg a party official 
he said the social democrats want to replace nuclear energy with 
power sources such as wind and sun 
but sven bengtsson an energy expert at the ministry of 
industry said with not a lot of sunshine in sweden solar 
energy is out of the question also even if wind power is 
implemented on a large scale it can only replace a small part of 
the total energy output 
a poll published early this week by eureka research said 52 
percent of the 80 party delegates it interviewed wanted to delay 
the nuclear shutdown a party paper said thursday that nearly 50 
percent of the 350 delegates wanted to reconsider the schedule for 
closing plants which was established by parliament in 1988 
the issue promises to produce the most controversial debates of 
the sixday congress the meeting held every three years is the 
highest decisionmaking body of the social democratic party 
influential social democrats such as union leader stig malm and 
minister of energy rune molin have said the deadline for 
abolishing nuclear power should be reconsidered at the least 
molin went further there is a lot speaking in favor of 
changing everything he said 
minister of environment birgitta dahl opposes any delay in the 
shutdown and says the most important consideration is the damage a 
nuclear accident can cause 
radiation from the chernobyl nuclear accident in the soviet 
union four years ago reinforced swedish public opinion against 
nuclear power radioactive particles brought by the wind and rain 
contaminated the plants that reindeer eat forcing the lapps in 
northern sweden to slaughter hundreds of the animals they depend on 
for food

if it comes to war military analysts say the 
united states and its allies could drive the iraqis out of kuwait 
but only with a land assault against a dugin iraqi army that might 
result in thousands of american casualties 
for comparisons one expert calls up the bloody islandtoisland 
pacific warfare against the japanese in world war ii another 
reaches further back to the british battle against the germans 
along the somme river in france during world war i in the first 30 
minutes of that fight 19240 british soldiers were killed or 
mortally wounded 
if we have to fight them the only thing that worries me is 
how many americans get killed said retired adm thomas h 
moorer former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff no one 
knows the answer to that 
the experts were asked a few simple but troubling questions as 
the massive buildup of american and allied forces continued apace 
on the saudi arabian peninsula 
if war comes would the american side win 
at what cost 
how long would it take 
thats a ridiculous question of course we can win said an 
incredulous moorer 78 who was shot down over the pacific in 1942 
and rescued by a freighter only to have it bombed out from under 
him 
it just depends on will and determination moorer added 
it doesnt have anything to do with capability we are capable 
and then some 
in interviews a variety of military analysts agreed with that 
assessment and made this addtional points 
the allies arent ready to launch an offensive against iraqi 
forces occupying kuwait and wont be until the american contingent 
now numbering 100000 is twice as large perhaps not until late 
october 
if iraq has 200000 men in kuwait then youd want a sizeable 
american advantage before you launch an attack said james a 
blackwell jr analyst with the center for strategic and 
international studies and former west point instructor he sees a 
need for 200000 us troops augmented by 50000 to 100000 arab 
soldiers as well as forces from other countries 
iraq cannot be ejected from kuwait militarily without a ground 
war it cant be done from the air or with hightech warfare alone 
i dont think you can win it by bombing iraq said jack n 
meritt a retired fourstar army general who was the us 
representative to natos military committee weve been trying 
that since world war ii and there has been no case in history where 
youve been able to defeat a force on the ground from the air 
fighting the iraqis in kuwait would be difficult fighting 
them on the ground in iraq would be infinitely more difficult 
said harry g summers jr a retired army colonel combat 
infantry veteran of korea and vietnam and fellow of the army war 
college if we set the goal as the expulsion of iraq from kuwait 
then the cost will be high but not nearly what it would be if we 
tried to conquer iraq i cant imagine anybody being that dumb as 
to take on that task 
it is important militarily and politically that arab and 
other allied forces be in the midst of the fighting 
you wouldnt want to lead with american forces youd want 
arab forces to take the immediate action said blackwell its 
important to keep the coalition together this cant become an 
american war 
while the united states has been building up the iraqis have 
been digging in preparing to do what they did best in the 
eightyear iraniraq war 
said blackwell if saddam hussein orders his iraqi occupiers 
to fight to the death in kuwait city and secure their place in 
heaven jiminy christmas thats a long fight months not to 
mention the tens of thousands of casualties in such a fight 
summers to illustrate the difficulties of going against an 
entrenched enemy drew a parallel with the battle on the somme on 
july 1 1916 when there was enormous british bloodshed in just 
minutes 
that gives you the outside parameter of what kind of 
casualties can result from assaulting fortified positions head 
on he said you can go much lower but still it is probably 
the most difficult kind of warfare 
we need to remember that they iraqis fought the iraniraq war 
primarily on the defensive that is by far the strongest form of 
war it is not decisive but it can certainly cause enormous 
casualties 
added blackwell if theyre defending the city room by room to 
the death were back to islandclearing operations in the pacific 
in world war ii 
on the other hand the americans have significant advantages 
we own the night with our military force said merritt 
all our tanks and aircraft are night fighters we might be so 
effective so quickly that we can destroy their morale and keep our 
casualties down in the main and on the average were 
technologically far superior and our training is far superior 
he added that theres much talk about saddams 
battlehardened army but it is also a battleweary army 
and moorer pointed out that while saddam has 5500 tanks many 
are obsolete because of the blockade hes going to have spare 
parts problems to keep his machines going 
he said saddam could make a big noise for two or three days 
but in my view he doesnt have sustainability 
american commanders in the field exude confidence that they can 
prevail the commander of american forces gen h norman 
schwarzkopf said the american technological advantage should not 
be discounted 
we would be using capabilities that are far more lethal far 
more accurate and far more effective than anything we have ever 
used he said 
and marine maj gen royal n moore said the us attack would 
pulverize iraqs defenses in minutes 
we want about three to five minutes and were going to give 
them the most violent three to five minutes theyve ever seen 
moore said thats all we want 
but he cautioned im not going to ever predict that its 
going to be a cakewalk if we do it right the casualties will be 
light we hope

when capt francisco mena deserted 
the army and joined el salvadors guerrillas they greeted him with 
tentative embraces hard stares and skepticism 
for a year a veteran fighter known as fredy never let mena walk 
behind him 
there was a ceremony that was a bit awkward mena who 
changed sides in 1981 told an interviewer i gave a talk and 
afterward the guerrillas began asking questions 
some of those questions he said were why did you stay so 
long in the army how many operations did you take part in how 
many of us have you killed 
damn i thought what have i gotten myself into here i 
came to help these guys and theyre busting my chops mena 
said 
he smiled at the recollection and brushed one hand through his 
wavy black hair the 47yearold rebel commander was in the 
delegation that on aug 22 ended a fruitless round of peace talks 
here with the government of alfredo cristiani the salvadoran 
president 
a nearly 11yearold civil war between the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front and a succession of usbacked 
governments has killed an estimated 72000 people most of them 
civilians 
the trip to costa rica was menas first involvement in the 
monthly negotiations and his first respite from the fighting in 
years 
he was included because the exclusive subject of the talks this 
month was a rebel demand that the armed forces be purged of corrupt 
officers and reformed that issue is the main sticking point in the 
negotations 
col mauricio vargas as a member of the government delegation 
protects the militarys interests at the talks 
officially the salvadoran military holds mena in contempt in 
the words of col orlando zepeda vice minister of defense that 
traitor and murderer has no moral right to make accusations or 
demands on us 
classmates at the military and some other officers however 
have demonstrated a camaraderie with mena that could help promote 
eventual accord 
lt col mauricio duke shook hands and chatted amiably with 
mena his former superior when they met in the lobby of the hotel 
where the talks were held 
mena gave a copy of his book from the national army to the 
guerrilla army to duke who responded with a sly smile 
gracias my captain 
the copy like another sent to vargas was inscribed lets 
not forget the 15th of october 
that is the date in 1979 when young officers vargas mena and 
duke included overthrew the rightist dictatorship of gen carlos 
humberto romero 
a broadbased government whose objective was national 
reconciliation resulted but a purge of the military old guard 
faltered repression and death squads followed and the result was 
civil war 
mena traces his change of heart to a year as an officer of the 
national guard a militarized police force 
he described counterinsurgency tactics that included torture 
rape and murder of alleged leftists and told of an initiation rite 
during which he declined an invitation to drive a bayonet through 
the heart of a suspect 
while he pondered such brutality later in his airconditioned 
office mena said the suspect and 11 others were killed in the 
gymnasium of the national guard headquarters 
that kind of thing consolidated my change of thinking by 
making me profoundly question the role we military men were 
playing he said it became denigrating for me to wear the 
national guard insignia 
the proclamation issued by those who carried out the 1979 coup 
promised respect for human rights an end to corruption and 
modernization of a semifeudal economy that left most salvadorans 
destitute 
peace is possible if military authorities honor those goals 
mena said but added the picture is this were getting nowhere 
in negotiations so lets have at it with the irons 
fredy the guerrilla fighter so wary of mena was killed in 
combat in 1985 
just before he died mena said they had a conversation in which 
fredy told him 
in those early days i didnt trust you a bit like you were 
still the enemy who ever would have believed that wed come to be 
like brothers that id gladly give my life for you

a weather expert is issuing a longterm storm 
warning for people living along the atlantic and florida coasts 
this decade and the early years of the 21st century could see a 
return to more frequent and stronger hurricanes such as those that 
battered the region before a recent period of relative calm 
the reason the droughtplagued sahel region in west africa 
seems to be moving into a moister period historically when that 
happens more hurricanes form in the atlantic and they are stronger 
than the tropical cyclones of other years 
the warning came from william m gray a professor of 
atmospheric science at colorado state university writing in 
todays edition of science the journal of the american association 
for the advancement of science 
gray said the intense caribbean hurricanes gilbert joan and 
hugo of 1988 and 1989 may be the forerunners of this change 
relatively few intense hurricanes affected the united states 
between 1970 and 1987 a period when the sahel region suffered a 
severe drought gray noted 
the principal beneficiaries he said were the east coast 
caribbean basin and the florida peninsula 
it is these coastal areas not so much the gulf coast that 
will likely see the largest upswing in landfall of intense 
hurricanes when a long period of heavier rainfall returns again to 
west africa gray said 
if past variations are an indication of the future he wrote 
we should expect an eventual recurrence of somewhat heavier 
western sahel precipitation possibly during the 1990s and the 
early years of the 21st century 
with such a rainfall increase we should also expect a return 
of more frequent intense hurricane activity in the caribbean basin 
and along the us coastline gray added 
during the years of relatively few hurricanes coastal 
poplations have grown rapidly and gray said residents of these 
areas need to be wary in the coming years 
the federal climate analysis center meanwhile reported that 
while much of north and central africa is dry rainfall increased 
in july and early august in large areas of the western sahel the 
region also was relatively moist in 1988 and 1989 
gray rummaged through historical records and found that the 
sahel seems to alternate with long periods of dry conditions 
followed by moister times for example it was wet from about 1870 
to 1900 1915 to 1935 and 1947 to 1969 
records are poor for the earliest period but gray found that 
the atlantic and caribbean region averaged 552 days per year of 
intense hurricanes from 1915 to 1935 and 853 days between 1947 and 
1969 by contrast the dry periods in between averaged between 21 
and 25 days of intense hurricanes 
why should rain in africa cause hurricanes to hit the united 
states 
atlantic hurricanes are powerful storms that tend to originate 
just north of the equator in a region where trade winds come 
together to create rising air currents 
when the ocean is warm 80 degrees fahrenheit or more it helps 
create hurricanes this water warms the air along its surface 
causing it to rise as that air rises the seawater it holds 
evaporates a process that forms clouds and at the same time heats 
the air even more and causes it to continue rising this gives 
strength to the storm 
weather disturbances move off the coast of africa over the ocean 
50 or more times a year some of them generate hurricanes by 
helping this moist rising air organize into a churning storm 
its not the number of african disturbances that matters said 
gray but the fact that in moist years they are better organized 
into storms themselves and move more slowly across the ocean 
building strength as they go

enrollment at international schools 
has plummeted as foreign workers and their families head home to 
escape tensions in the persian gulf 
and the expatriates who remain say they cope with the standoff 
by holding discussions on middle east events and staging duck and 
cover drills 
the foreign community in saudi arabia has shrunk drastically 
since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait roughly 5000 americans 
left the countrys eastern province a few have trickled back 
at the saudi aramco schools enrollment is about onefifth of 
normal when school opened saturday 410 students showed up down 
from 2010 projected before the crisis 
the aramco schools kindergarten through ninth grade are run by 
the oilproducing company aramco for the children of foreigners 
the dhahran academy a private school for expatriates will open 
sept 15 two weeks later than expected only 600 students half 
the normal number have signed up said principal don kirkpatrick 
there are few americans in the classes he said 
the low enrollment is also apparent at dhahran hills junior high 
school nancy hicks seventhgrade language class had two rows of 
empty seats 
i thought more of my friends would be here said 12yearold 
miriam france who returned from denver colo two days ago many 
people including junior high vice principal bill vahey have put 
their children in shools in the united states for this falls 
term 
vaheys wife and family are in hilton head sc but they 
expect to come back to saudi arabia in late october 
a us government advisory suggests dependents of foreigner 
workers stay out of saudi arabias eastern province 
john mcclung 12 of oceanside calif said his family planned 
to stay in the united states but his father changed his mind after 
talking to aramco officials 
teachers and students showed little concern for their security 
although they wanted to talk about the crisis and the presence of 
us troops in the province 
we have discussed the apprehension vahey said i went 
into one class and gave them some political backround 
i dont feel they are tense but they want to talk about it 
ms hicks said 
ms hicks said she and her husband a structural engineer were 
determined not to let the invasion intimidate them they are just 
months shy of retirement she said 
i resented that person causing all this disruption ms 
hicks said referring to iraqi president saddam hussein 
several teachers however have resigned because of the 
political uncertainty she said 
the school is taking measures in case of attack 
the evacuation plan has been updated and the basement has been 
converted into a bomb shelter stocked with water flashlights and 
canned goods vahey said 
duck and cover drills have been held with children diving 
under desks and covering their heads with their arms he said 
for some students the gulf crisis has not changed their 
feelings about heading to class 
its not as exciting as it used to be said john mcclung 
school is boring

a towering soviet soldier smashes a swastika 
with a giant sword marx stares at passing traffic cars roll down 
ho chi minh lenin tugs on his lapel 
germany is less than three weeks away from becoming a single 
bastion of western capitalism but much of the new nation will be 
filled with totems to the old east germany 
while leaders argue over how to pay for unification and east 
germans worry about their jobs many towns are wondering what to do 
with all those old statues streets squares and schools dedicated 
to the stalwarts of socialism 
it is a problem far more complex than merely changing street 
signs and carting away scowling icons of stone and bronze 
in southern east germany karl marx city wasted little time 
reclaiming its historical name chemnitz 
but it is taking much longer to decide what to do with karl 
himself a huge glowering bust that dwarfs tourists who stare at 
his gargantuan noggin in the heart of town 
no community has taken a greater interest in this issue than 
east berlin the showcase of the former communist government and 
the historic heart of what will be the capital of a united nation 
an estimated 800 postwar monuments dot the cityscape some of 
them the centerpieces of squares in leninplatz the soviet 
revolutionary is affixed to a jagged panel scowling in flowing 
overcoat one hand on his lapel and the other clenched at his side 
in marxengels platz engels stands erect while marx sits at his 
side his huge lap a favorite place for tourists to nestle for 
photo opportunities 
a committee of artists and historians convened last week to 
begin an monumentbymonument appraisal of what to do with the 
memorials a similiar committee has been charged with examining 
street names 
some germans want to remove all remnants of the regime imposed 
by the soviets after world war ii others say they should to some 
extent be preserved 
monuments even if they are horrible or an attack against good 
taste are part of the postwar history here said klaus hetzel a 
spokesman for the east berlin government you can find other 
solutions for them 
the east berlin committee members believe many statues will be 
retained but altered perhaps by adding plaques that put them in 
historical perspective 
others may have new gardens or green spaces around them to 
soften them 
still others may be carted away to a single location becoming 
part of a museum that will in a sense be a graveyard of communist 
artifacts 
what we do not want to do is merely get rid of everything 
said richard dahlheim deputy chairman of the citys cultural 
affairs department too many historical remnants are lost to the 
emotions of the moment 
few monuments trigger more emotions than the giant soviet 
memorial in east berlins charming treptow park many people are 
stunned by the militaristic scope of this tribute to soviet 
soldiers who died while conquering germany from the east 
to see it a visitor follows a path lined with birch trees 
leading to a pedestal of stairs two red granite walls shaped like 
drooping flags form a gateway two giant soviet soldiers kneel in 
front of each wall 
on the other side is a lawn that stretches for more than 550 
yards the burial place for 5000 soviet soldiers on each side are 
eight stone sacrcophagi depicting feats of heroism 
at the end of the lawn is a mausoleum on which a 38foothigh 
soldier stands broadshouldered and handsome the soldier smashes 
a swastika with a sword and clutches a child creating an idealized 
image of a soviet avenger slaying the nazi oppressors and saving 
the innocent 
many germans want it shipped back to the soviets 
marx is okay but get rid of that thing said werner 
tischer 72 a native berliner 
west berlin also has monuments to its world war ii occupiers 
including a soviet memorial and a street named after karl marx 
hetzel said it will be up to a future united berlin government what 
should remain or be modified 
an estimated 100 to 200 streets are being studied by the east 
berlin streets committee ranging from streets named after salvador 
allende the former marxist leader of chile to konstantin 
ziolkowski a father of soviet flight technology 
they already have decided to change the name of otto grotewohl 
street named after the first east german prime minister who was a 
hardline stalinist 
one broad avenue americans are always startled to see is named 
after ho chi minh the communist leader who drove the americans out 
of vietnam 
there is even a wall street its namesake nearby however has 
been reduced to rubble

buttery croissants are traditional at 
breakfast in france but an agriculture department report says corn 
flakes and other cereals are gaining favor 
sales of breakfast cereals in france rose 25 percent in value 
last year following a growth of more than 80 percent from 1985 to 
1988 
the report in the october issue of agexporter magazine said 1989 
imports of breakfast cereals into france were valued at 59 
million and totaled 30496 metric tons or 92 percent of total 
sales 
most of the imports came from west germany where kelloggs 
the most popular brand on french store shelves has a plant other 
major suppliers were britain and italy 
although imports from the united states were insignificant 
and have been for several years the report said there is room 
for competition 
there is potential for us cereal sales particularly for 
new innovative products targeted at a niche market and distributed 
through speciality stores the report said 
no one expects frenchconsumed breakfast cereals to drain the 
us corn bin right away however the usdas latest crop estimate 
issued this week pointed to a corn harvest of 812 billion bushels 
up 8 percent from last year 
the september estimate has helped push down prices at the farm 
now protected by usda economists at an average of 210 to 250 
per bushel in the corn marketing year that began sept 1 that was 
down 25 cents a bushel from the projected season price a month ago 
although the biggest uses of corn are domestic livestock feeding 
and exports the cereal market is not to be sneezed at 
the usda groups together a selection of uses for corn as food 
seed and industrial purposes wetmilled products such as 
sweeteners starch and alcohol are included as well as drymilled 
and cooked products plus corn used for seed 
altogether in the 198990 marketing year that just ended 128 
billion bushels of corn were required to fill those demands 
this year according to the latest projections the use of corn 
for those purposes is expected to gain further to about 13 billion 
bushels 
most of the increase likely will be in the wet milling sector 
among the corn sweeteners and alcohol said the departments 
economic research service dry milling will likely use about the 
same amount 
 
washington ap the agriculture department has been told to 
use ethanol or etbe blends of gasoline in government vehicles as a 
way of confronting the mideast oil crunch 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said the use of ethanol 
and etbe or ethyl tertiary butyl ether in the departments cars 
and trucks is required if the fuels are available at prices 
competitive to regular unleaded gasoline 
ethanol is produced from american corn and other agricultural 
products and thats good for american farmers yeutter said 
thursday 
it also helps reduce us dependency on foreign oil he said 
president bush in his speech tuesday night to congress said fuel 
switching would be one way to ease the nations dependency on oil 
imports 
this is a great way for each of us as individuals and as 
members of usda to demonstrate our commitment to americas 
farmers americas environment and americas future yeutter said 
in a statement 
the usda operates more than 33000 cars and light trucks in all 
50 states if all were fueled with ethanolblended gasoline they 
would use about 17 million gallons of ethanol a year which would 
require 680000 bushels of corn 
on wednesday the department estimated this falls corn harvest 
at 812 billion bushels department analysts say about 220 million 
bushels of corn were used for fuel in 198990 up from 210 million 
the previous year a further increase is expected in the corn 
marketing year that began sept 1 
yeutter noted that the availability of ethanol and etbe blends 
of gasoline varies from state to state he also urged the 
departments 100000 employees to use the blends in their personal 
vehicles 
spokeswoman kelly shipp said yeutters staff was looking 
around for a local source of blended fuel to use in usda cars 
carrying the secretary and other senior officials so far none had 
been found she said 
 
washington ap the agriculture department says there is a 
record supply of tree nuts except for walnuts 
a usda report said thursday that the burdensome supply of 
nuts expected in 199091 probably will result in lower grower 
prices because consumption has not kept pace in recent years

steven balourdos was tired of the glitz along the 
citys magnificent mile so he did what he used to do back home in 
greece he planted tomatoes some of his neighbors are less than 
enthusiastic but balourdos says hes standing by his fruit 
i feel very strongly to do what i do back home balourdos 
said thursday he emigrated from a tomatogrowing region in the 
1950s and runs a business on michigan avenue 
you see a lot of diamonds you see a lot of mink coats you 
see a lot of rollsroyces but you dont see any tomatoes on 
michigan avenue he said 
earlier this summer balourdos had a yearning for some 
earthiness to counterbalance the downtown shopping streets glitter 
and haute couture 
he planted about 30 tomato plants in square granite containers 
on the sidewalk outside a highrise where he runs his secondstory 
real estate development company only four spindly plants remain 
the rest have been ripped out by unknown foes 
the buildings association of condominium owners contends 
tomatoes may be fine in pasta primavera but a makeshift garden has 
no place on michigan avenue 
i do not believe that those tomato plants are an asset to the 
front of our building bearing in mind the beauty of all of the 
other buildings on the avenue said the associations president 
marilyn lewis 
planters outside other buildings on the street contain exotic 
flowers neatly pruned trees and shrubs 
we just dont fit in mrs lewis said of the tomato plants 
the majority of the associations nine board members agreed that 
the tomatoes are an affront the avenues aesthetic standards mrs 
lewis said 
i dont know whether he thinks hes a comedian or what said 
resident eleanor folta 81 i guess he thinks he can do whatever 
he wants 
we can pray for a quick frost and thatll take care of that 
she said 
balourdos has refused to back down the condo association is 
considering complaining to the greater north michigan avenue 
association which has guidelines recommending plants on the street 
be beautiful and lowkey spokeswoman jane driscoll said 
ms driscoll said she didnt know if her organization would 
formally object to the tomato plants the group can issue only 
recommendations and has no enforcement powers she said 
the owner of a nearby jewelry store cant understand the fuss 
if they were ripe id go pick the tomatoes instead of going 
to the store said henry kaplan owner of henry kay jewelers 
balourdos says hes received more than two dozen letters of 
support he pledged to go to court if necessary to keep his 
beloved plants in sight outside his office window 
hundreds of people have stopped their cars to see the tomatoes 
on michigan avenue he said people pass by and they touch it 
its a great feeling

a 193 million bill encouraging young people 
to volunteer for community service projects won house passage 
despite a veto threat from the white house 
the national service act approved on a voice vote thursday now 
goes to a conference committee to resolve differences with a 
version passed by the senate last spring 
the senate version is less costly and contains a key provision 
not included by the house a 35 million demonstration program 
providing financial aid to college students and firsttime 
homebuyers in exchange for community volunteer work 
democratic backers of that provision reluctantly supported the 
bill and said they would try to have it restored in conference 
this is not national service said rep dave mccurdy 
dokla one of the sponsors of tying financial aid to youth 
service this is a very weak image of what we saw as national 
service 
the idea was the outgrowth of a proposal by the democratic 
leadership council a group of moderate and conservative democrats 
trying to push their party toward the political right 
without that provision the house bill would provide money for 
federal grants to states to establish programs in the schools 
encouraging community service volunteer work and incorporating the 
service into school curricula 
it would set up an american conservation corps to perform 
volunteer projects for conservation historical and cultural 
projects it would establish a youth service corps as part of the 
existing action volunteer program to perform volunteer service in 
social programs including nursing homes day care centers and other 
nonprofit organizations 
the senates 35 million demonstration program would provide 
young people vouchers of up to 5000 good for higher education 
or firsthome purchases in return for a years volunteer work 
that provision was strongly opposed by rep gus hawkins 
dcalif chairman of the house education and labor committee 
which removed it before sending the bill to the floor hawkins told 
the house his bill rejects any linkage between service and 
student financial assistance 
this bill is an attempt to make the concept of service more 
central to americans life and work hawkins said 
republicans opposed the measure as too costly and unnecessary 
and some said government involvement would actually discourage 
people to do volunteer work 
here we are today in the midst of deficit reduction saying 
lets pass another program a centralized bureaucracy for 
volunteerism said rep steve gunderson rwis 
its unnecessary added rep thomas petri rwis the 
volunteer service is alive and well and just doesnt need 
government messing around with it 
the white house budget office said in a statement that bushs 
advisers would recommend he veto the bill if enacted in the version 
approved by the house the statement said the measure is too 
costly provides unneeded financial incentives and is an attempt 
to direct community service efforts from the federal level rather 
than from the community 
the bill provides for government student aid loans to be 
deferred and partially canceled for students who perform fulltime 
volunteer community service are professionally employed in drug 
counseling or do fulltime volunteer work providing health care to 
american indians 
the house defeated 212200 a move by republicans to eliminate 
the loan cancellation provision which they said would cause untold 
cost to the government sponsors however said it would amount to 
only 500000 a year

portauprince haiti ap after 186 years of authoritarian 
rule mostly out of the barrel of a gun democracy has again been 
deferred on this impoverished caribbean island 
the postponement of elections has threatened to unravel the 
caretaker civilian government of president ertha pascaltrouillot 
and raised new doubts about whether haiti can succeed in its march 
toward democracy 
she cannot make good on her pledge to hold genuine elections 
so her administration has lost its reason to exist said gerard 
pierrecharles one of haitis most respected political analysts 
we are sliding inexorably towards the temptation of a military 
coup 
the independent electoral council charged by the constitution 
with organizing free and fair balloting said last week it was 
postponing the nov 4 elections until sometime in december for lack 
of funds 
but critics say the problem is more than money they accuse 
pascaltrouillots 6monthold transitional government with 
corruption and ineptness 
during her short term haiti has been beset by a crime wave 
unpunished political murders and growing poverty in what is already 
one of the worlds poorest countries 
the problem of elections is not only technical it is 
political the government looks down its nose at the prerequisites 
of justice and security said jeanclaude bajeux a member of the 
12party unity assembly politcal coalition 
mrs pascaltrouillot a former supreme court judge was 
appointed by the unity assembly on march 13 after the fall of lt 
gen prosper avril who had taken power in september 1988 during a 
soldiers rebellion that toppled the previous government 
mrs pascaltrouillot was to govern jointly with a council of 
state a quasilegislative body of 19 prominent haitians 
the governments main task was to lead haiti to its first free 
elections since independence from france in 1804 
it is the countrys fifth government since jeanclaude duvalier 
fled to exile in france in 1986 ending 29 years of dictatorial 
duvalierfamily rule 
mrs pascaltrouillot has had the support of the united states 
it has tied renewal of economic aid cut after an election day 
massacre in 1987 to democratic elections 
five presidential candidates considered strong contenders 
disavow any efforts to unseat the president before elections but 
seven political parties in the unity assembly have called for her 
resignation and say they will boycott the vote if she is president 
they made the appeal after the council of state broke relations 
with her on aug 14 council members charged she was an obstacle to 
elections and five cabinet ministers later resigned 
we can say she has continually acted in bad faith in 
violation of the conditions of her appointment said dr louis 
roy president of the council her policy to avoid confrontation 
with the most retrograde and criminal elements has led us to 
this impasse 
the council charges she has not abided by an accord signed with 
political leaders to institute urgent administrative judicial and 
military reforms 
the president has also alienated labor unions and businessmen 
who believe mismanagement of funds is behind a 30 million budget 
deficit 20 million of which accrued since april 
misgivings perhaps could have been overlooked had the government 
investigated the murder of council member serge villard who was 
shot and killed in broad daylight on june 21 by men linked to the 
army also killed in the attack was a union activist 
there have been no arrests even though more than a dozen people 
witnessed the shooting 
a month after the assassinations two figures linked to brutal 
previous regimes returned to the country from exile and remain at 
large despite warrants for their arrest 
many fear years vote could be disrupted by the return of roger 
lafontant whose feared tontons macoute militia kept the duvalier 
family in power and retired maj gen williams regala 
regala was head of security during the november 1987 massacre of 
34 voters at the polls by thugs working in collusion with the army 
voter registration is set for oct 5 but the electoral council 
said it will suspend election activities if voters do not sign up 
in sufficient numbers to give credibility to the next government 
mrs pascaltrouillot has vowed to remain in office until 
elections 
despite the uncertainty many haitians still hold out hope that 
haiti will not return to the tyranny of the past the popular 
desire for democracy is too deeply rooted to be eradicated said 
the analyst pierrecharles

cbs will join with tokyo broadcasting system to 
share the financial burden of gathering news overseas 
under the agreement announced thursday the two companies also 
will study the possibility of coproducing sports and entertainment 
programming although no joint projects in those areas are 
imminent said james a warner president of cbs marketing arm cbs 
enterprises 
the agreement is effective in april he said 
john frazee cbs news vice president for news services said 
the agreement isnt necessarily a prelude to a larger operation 
that might eventually try to compete globally with the 24hour 
cable news network 
cnn started in 1980 is seen in 95 countries 
ill just say that anything is possible and we are looking at 
all kinds of possibilities with the japanese network frazee 
said well consider anything 
cbs and tokyo broadcasting have cooperated with each other on 
news coverage for 30 years and share office space in new york 
tokyo and johannesburg 
the two will have access to each others worldwide news reports 
and programs with tbs getting exclusive rights to air in japan all 
cbs news reports and such programs as 60 minutes 
cbs news once provided news to the rival nhk network but that 
arrangement ended two years ago frazee said cbs still services 
several japanese broadcast companies but will stop when the 
exclusive agreement with tokyo broadcasting begins warner said 
tokyo broadcasting and cbs news plan to share office space in 
more overseas cities possibly starting with a berlin office that 
also would be shared with cnn frazee said 
save for tentative plans for berlin no decisions had been 
made on other cities for the sharing of news frazee said 
cbs news had been the only one of the three major us networks 
without an overseas partner in sharing newsgathering costs 
nbc news bought a 375 percent interest in visnews a 
londonbased video news service abc news has a 45 percent interest 
in a similar agency in london worldwide television news which cbs 
also subscribes to 
cbs news will continue as a subscriber to worldwide television

american telephone amp telegraph co is making 
it easier for families and friends to reach out and touch us 
military personnel stationed in the middle east 
the company said thursday that beginning sept 21 it will 
provide free facsimile service at its 400 phone sales centers in 
the united states for messages to the more than 100000 troops 
taking part in operation desert shield 
mci communications corp also was considering a range of 
services to families including facsimile and electronic mail 
perhaps through personal computers said jerry edgerton mci vice 
president for government systems 
us sprint spokesman jim crawford said his company was 
considering installing more phone lines electronic mail service or 
videoconferencing to the middle east 
atampts desert fax service resulted from a request from sen 
alan cranston dcalif who also asked mci and sprint to provide 
similar services to the troops 
if were using 20th century weapons we also should be using 
20th century communications cranston said in a statement he 
said a facsimile service would provide a big boost to morale for 
us forces participating in operation desert shield 
atampt said the duration of desert fax will depend on several 
factors including cost volume of messages and benefits to 
military personnel and their families 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said it normally would cost someone 
346 to use the same facsimile service to transmit a page to the 
middle east he added that atampt had installed 25 facsimile machines 
at an undisclosed location in the middle east to handle the 
messages 
a facsimile or fax machine takes a printed page and 
translates it into electronic signals that are sent through the 
phone network and reprinted by a distant facsimile machine 
atampt said military postal service personnel will deliver the 
messages at regular mail calls in the middle east where us 
troops were posted following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
senders must fill out forms with a message the name of a person 
stationed in the middle east and an apo or fpo address atampt said 
it cannot accept messages without proper apo or fpo addresses 
the addresses of atampt phone centers may be obtained by calling

soviet embassy to announce details of the meeting for peace 
more than 250 soviets and an equal number of americans will meet 
oct 1218 in lawrence kan 
theres never been anything quite like this where several 
hundred people from the soviet union have descended upon one state 
coming in peace as they are said bob swan of lawrence the us 
cochairman of the event 
the soviets from all 15 republics and a crosssection of 
society will live with american families and participate in events

group will attend a special ceremony on oct 13 in abilene kan

ussoviet relations said ivanov citing eisenhowers open 
skies proposal to permit air inspection of each countrys 
military bases it was during eisenhowers administration in 1959

sen dale bumpers says he cant fathom why the 
federal government would sell mineralrich lands at terms enacted 
by ulysses s grant 
so the arkansas democrat is sponsoring legislation that would 
levy an 8 percent royalty and raise the fees charged on lands 
obtained from the federal government for mining hardrock 
minerals such as gold silver copper or iron 
the 118yearold law signed into law when grant was president 
allows miners outright ownership of land for a fee of 250 to 5 
an acre the approximate price of land in 1872 if they prove 
theyve found a valuable deposit and performed 500 worth of work 
there 
i dont understand why this particular industry ought to 
just have a bird nest on the ground bumpers said thursday at a 
hearing of a senate energy and commerce subcommittee there isnt 
a state in the nation that would permit this 
the government already gets royalties from oil gas and coal 
leases he noted 
the bush administration however joined representatives of 
mining companies in opposing bumpers proposal 
royalties could make it economically unfeasible to risk 
developing mineral deposits on public lands said cy jamison 
director of the interior departments bureau of land management 
stephen alfers a denver attorney who analyzed bumpers 
legislation at the senate committees request said the proposal 
would have a devastating impact on the us mining industry 
smaller miners will have no future many mines will close 
construction of new mines will decline precipitously exploration 
and discovery of new deposits will decline and mining activity 
will concentrate on private lands and in foreign countries 
alfers said 
an 8 percent royalty on gross proceeds would consume nearly half 
the typical mining companys profit said alfers who represents 
landowners and mining companies who develop minerals on public and 
private lands 
the proposed royalty would raise 300 million a year for federal 
and state governments bumpers said the bureau of land management 
estimates that 39 billion in minerals are mined from public lands 
each year he said 
since 1970 the federal government has sold land worth up to 47 
million for just 4500 according to a recent general accounting 
office study

a divorced couple must jointly decide 
what to do with seven frozen embryos a tennessee appeals court has 
ruled overturning a landmark decision that granted custody to the 
woman 
charles clifford the lawyer for junior lewis davis declared 
the thursday ruling a complete vindication and said it could 
lead to a settlement in the case 
kurt erlenbach who represents davis former wife mary sue 
davis stowe said the decision may be just another step in the 
legal battle over the embryos the only disputed issue in the 
couples divorce 
i am very disappointed mary is quite upset erlenbach said 
my guess is that we are going to appeal that we are going to 
ask the tennessee supreme court to hear it he said 
erlenbach doubted that davis and mrs stowe can resolve the 
future of the embryos which were produced in vitro in december 
1988 using his sperm and her eggs 
neither mrs stowe who lives in titusville fla or davis 
from maryville would comment thursday both have remarried 
in february 1989 davis sued his wife for divorce asking a 
court to prevent any use of the embryos without his consent davis 
argued he should not be forced to become a parent against his 
wishes 
circuit judge w dale young called the embryos children in 
vitro and ruled in september 1989 that life begins at conception 
and the embryos deserved protection under the law he awarded 
custody to mrs stowe 
the tennessee court of appeals sent the case back to young to 
enter a judgment giving mrs stowe and davis joint control of the 
fertilized ova and equal voice over their disposition 
it would be repugnant and offensive to constitutional 
principals to order mary sue to implant these fertilized ova 
against her will judge herschel p franks wrote for the 
threemember court 
it would be equally repugnant to order junior to bear the 
psychological if not the legal consequences of paternity against 
his will the opinion said 
davis has said he wanted an equal role in deciding what to do 
with the embryos but never stated what that role would be 
mrs stowe initially said she wanted the embryos because they 
were possibly her last chance to give birth later she said she 
wanted to donate them anonymously to a childless couple a move 
opposed by davis 
the appeals court did not consider the issue of whether the 
embryos are alive and deserving of legal protection

president bush wants congress to provide an 
additional 18 billion to cover the unexpected costs of operation 
desert shield through the end of this month administration and 
congressional sources say 
bush will formally ask congress today for the money in an 
emergency spending package that also includes a request to forgive 
7 billion in past military debt owed the united states by egypt 
said the sources speaking only on condition of anonymity 
the request also includes a proposal to transfer 900 million 
for the persian gulf deployment from unused accounts within the 
pentagon to make up the rest of the 27 billion additional costs 
incurred in the operation the sources said 
the 1990 fiscal year ends sept 30 and the white house hopes 
that paying some of operation desert shields bills in the current 
year will ease pressure at least slightly as the administration and 
congress draft a defense department budget for 1991 according to 
the sources 
we want to get it up and done so theres not that budget 
impact said an administration official 
and the debt forgiveness for egypt is included in hopes that 
pairing it with the military money will make it easier for 
lawmakers always wary of foreign aid to support said one 
administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
theres a lot of head scratching over how we are gonna pull 
this off 30 days before an election a source said 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger in visits to key 
members of the house and senate on wednesday argued that the debt 
forgiveness for egypt is necessary to reward an ally that has taken 
a leadership role in rallying the arab world against iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
in the private meetings eagleburger has made the case that aid 
to egypt bolsters a moderate arab state and helps to stem the 
rising tide of moslem fundamentalism in the middle east egypt has 
been the linchpin of us efforts to mount a broad international 
response to the invasion eagleburger argued 
but while many lawmakers agree egypt is worthy of a reward they 
wince at the size of the debt forgiveness and worry that other us 
aid recipients will line up for similar largesse at a time when the 
budget can ill afford it 
sen patrick leahy dvt said he has asked the administration 
for a better idea of how much the debt forgiveness will cost the 
united states in lost repayments each year 
egypt should be helped said leahy chairman of the senate 
appropriations foreign aid subcommittee they do have their neck 
out about as far as you can get but theres going to be a need to 
help a lot of people 
leahy said he would like to handle it all at once instead of 
piecemeal and with a full picture of the costs involved

it was a historic moment the other day when 
representatives of the four victorious world war ii powers meeting 
in moscow took the steps that will permit germany to become a 
sovereign reunified state 
too bad they couldnt savor the moment more than they did the 
perils of the persian gulf crisis were perceived to be too great 
for more than a perfunctory celebration 
just hours before the ceremony president bush spoke to congress 
and the american people in a formal setting for the first time 
about the crisis 
the close timing of the two events symbolized the transition 
from the ideological conflict of the cold war to the new and 
different type of struggle that the gulf conflict represents at 
the heart of which is economics 
in some ways the eastwest conflict was easier for americans to 
swallow after all the survival of democracy was at stake in the 
us commitment to the defense of european and other partners in 
the gulf the issue is somewhat less majestic the survival of 
cheap oil 
the administration not without cause has been saying that high 
principles are at stake in the gulf few dispute the contention of 
bush and most other world leaders that iraqi president saddam 
hussein violated international law when he devoured kuwait six 
weeks ago 
but the episode showed once again how selective governments can 
be in deciding when to be indignant how many governments would 
have lifted a finger in kuwaits defense if it were not sitting 
atop a huge pool of oil 
indonesia did much the same to east timor in 1975 that iraq did 
to kuwait this summer the timorese found themselves invaded one 
day and annexed the next international protests were limited 
largely to human rights groups the fuss was contained because too 
many countries prized their relationship with indonesia an oil 
country by the way 
americans feel more comfortable about defending democracy but 
they dont have that luxury in the gulf crisis the kuwaiti 
leadership by western standards was more benign than rulers 
elsewhere in the region but no one has ever detected a 
jeffersonian streak in them 
but as secretary of state james a baker iii sees it the stakes 
in the gulf are too high to allow moralistic concerns about 
multiparty democracy to transcend other interests 
the issue he said last week is not just a narrow question of 
the flow of oil from kuwait and iraq 
it is about a dictator who acting alone and unchallenged 
could strangle the global economic order determining by fiat 
whether we all enter a recession or even the darkness of a 
depression baker said 
the administrations defense of kuwait has taken it to some 
strange addresses one example is damascus where baker spent 
several hours thursday conferring with syrian officials 
there may be three or four countries in the world that 
administration officials find more disreputable than syria which 
the united states accuses of engaging in statesponsored terrorism 
but on the narrow issue of the persian gulf crisis the two nations 
happen to agree and to need each other 
in times of world tension the united states has often entered 
tactical alliances with dictators it would shun under ordinary 
circumstances 
in the name of anticommunism successive administrations cozied 
up to rightist strongmen from all continents they did so because 
the perceived alternative allowing a marxist group to take power 
was too perilous to contemplate 
with the decline of communism the united states can feel 
comfortable about loosening ties with countries whose only 
perceived virtue is opposition to marxism 
but with the rise of saddam the administration is ready to make 
common cause with just about anyone who shares the us concern 
about leaving him unchecked saddam at this point is about as 
isolated as he can be but the question lingers will the gulf 
crisis end as benignly as the cold war did

two us tobacco giants have leapt to the rescue 
of soviet smokers fuming over their worst cigarette shortage in 
decades 
philip morris and rj reynolds tobacco said thursday they will 
supply billions of cigarettes to the soviet union which has an 
estimated 70 million smokers out of a population of 285 million 
the financial details were not disclosed 
the shipments could help ease a domestic crisis that has caused 
unhappy smokers to protest in the streets of moscow and leningrad 
this summer 
the companies have been emphasizing sales to foreign countries 
as the us tobacco market gives ground to antismoking campaigns 
philip morris said the order by the russian republic the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics was the single biggest 
cigarette export order in the companys history 
marlboro and other wellknown philip morris brands will be part 
of the order that will amount to more than 20 billion cigarettes by 
the end of next year shipments by philip morris international 
inc a division of new yorkbased philip morris cos will start 
at the end of this month 
rj reynolds tobacco international inc a winstonsalem 
ncbased subsidiary of rjr nabisco inc said it signed a 
separate agreement to ship 14 billion cigarettes to the soviet 
union 
delivery of winston and other rj reynolds brands is expected 
to begin next month and conclude by september 1991 the company 
said 
both companies said they will have continuing involvement with 
the soviet tobacco industry 
philip morris said it has an agreement to supply additional 
quantities of cigarettes to the russian republic from 1992 to 1995 
under another agreement it will help soviet agencies develop their 
domestic cigarette industry 
similarly rj reynolds noted that it previously announced it 
would participate in a joint venture operation with the uritsky 
cigarette factory in leningrad 
the soviet union is the thirdlargest cigarette market in the 
world and we are pleased to help satisfy russian consumers 
pentup demand said aleardo g buzzi president and chief 
executive of philip morris international 
john dollisson a vice president at philip morris said the 
company will be paid in hard currency and in counter trade items 
which he declined to specify 
he said philip morris had been in negotiations for quite some 
time to get our products into the soviet union 
the us cigarettes sold in the soviet union are expected to be 
priced at a premium to the domestically made brands currently 
american cigarettes are sold on a limited basis in that country 
with sales restricted to dutyfree outlets and stores that accept 
only hard currency 
the shortage of cigarettes became so severe in the soviet union 
this summer that rationing was imposed in moscow where jars of 
used butts were being sold on street corners for as much as 16

tougher pollution controls will not only clean 
the air but help america ease its dependence on foreign oil the 
administration says in trying to head off criticism of 
antipollution bills in congress because of the oil crisis 
the environmental protection agency sought thursday to highlight 
the oilsaving potential of the clean air bill by releasing a study 
that estimated as much as 1 million barrels of oil a day could be 
saved if the legislation becomes law 
the study said the savings would come from utilities shifting 
from oil to natural gas to comply with acid rain pollution 
controls and the use of cleaner gasoline blends that contain 
nonpetroleum additives such as ethanol much of the savings would 
come toward the end of the decade 
the epa issued the report as some members of congress began 
questioning the wisdom of new and expensive pollution controls at a 
time of vaulting energy costs 
house and senate negotiators for weeks have been engaged in 
intense discussions to try to work out a final clean air bill 
before congress adjourns next month 
the conference committee members were scheduled to meet today to 
give final approval to a section of the bill requiring new 
industrial smog controls and several other provisions 
but broad sections of the legislation including those covering 
new emission controls on automobiles requirements for cleaner 
motor fuels in the most smogridden cities and curbs on acid rain 
have yet to be agreed upon 
the legislation is expected to cost industry as much as 25 
billion a year by the end of the decade when all requirements 
become effective 
opponents of the bill and industry lobbyists trying to thwart 
various sections of it have argued that such expensive controls 
are ill timed when energy prices are soaring with the potential of 
energy shortages in the months ahead 
but epa administrator william reilly said thursday the 
legislation is even more needed now 
i think the energy implications make it more urgently 
necessary than ever for congress to pass the bill said reilly in 
a telephone interview the total savings of 800000 to 1 
million barrels a day exceeds the total oil imports from kuwait and 
iraq 
according to the epa study between 300000 and 500000 barrels 
of oil a day could be saved by the end of the decade if utilities 
switch from sulfurcontaining oil to natural gas to comply with 
requirements for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions the emissions 
cause acid rain 
another 500000 barrels of oil a day could be saved because oil 
companies will have to sell cleaner fuels or gasoline blends that 
contain 15 percent or more of nonpetroleum additives the study 
said requirements for wider use of vehicles that use fuels other 
than gasoline also is expected to cut into oil demand the study 
said

the senate has endorsed legislation through 
which the defense department would gain greater authority to block 
technology exports by us companies to iraq iran libya and syria 
for national security reasons 
senate approval of the legislation came thursday on a voice 
vote its adoption came as it was learned that the commerce 
department despite pentagon objections last february approved the 
exporting to iraq of digital imageenhancing equipment made by 
california company 
clearly that device is going to be used against our forces 
theres no denying it said stephen bryen a former deputy 
assistant defense secretary for trade policy 
the pentagon already has national security controls over exports 
to a group of primarily communist bloc countries but now can only 
advise the commerce and state departments on export licenses for 
the four arab nations targeted in the legislation 
a provision expanding the defense departments authority was 
added by sen jesse helms rnc to a bill generally loosening 
restrictions on the sale of us computers telecommunications 
equipment and machine tools to newly democratizing countries in 
eastern europe 
helms cited the commerce departments approval in february 1989 
of selling two furnaces to iraq even though the manufacturer 
acknowledged they could be used to make nuclear fuel rods for an 
atomic weapons reactor 
that sale was stopped just before iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait when the pentagon appealed to president bush after commerce 
officials had refused to allow the defense department to review the 
manufacturers export license request 
we have this situation where the defense department says 
dont do that but is overruled by the commerce department 
helms said this has occurred over and over and over again 
also as part of the bill the senate approved a measure by sen 
richard shelby dala raising civil and criminal fines for 
violating president bushs embargo against iraq from 10000 and 
50000 respectively to 250000 and 1 million 
the bill now goes to a conference with negotiators from the 
house which at the behest of us manufacturers losing out to 
japan south korea and europe on export sales voted in june to 
ease the restrictions even more 
in the united states it takes a business 114 days on average 
to get an export license complained sen john kerry dmass 
whose state is home to several high technology manufacturers 
in germany it takes just 14 days and in japan only four 
days kerry said therein lies a great deal of the story why 
the united states is struggling in the world marketplace 
the legislation reauthorizes the export administration act 
giving the president authority to restrict exports and the us 
participation in the 17nation coordinating committee for 
multilateral security controls cocom 
cocom is a cold warera multinational agency that jointly 
determines which hightech goods are too militarily sensitive to be 
sold to potential enemies in june it agreed to greatly reduce 
restrictions on sales of computers and other technology to former 
iron curtain countries in eastern europe 
meanwhile a company stuck with four multimilliondollar 
furnaces that the bush administration first approved and then 
disapproved for shipment to iraq filed a 62 million suit thursday 
against saddam husseins government 
the federal court suit by consarc corp claims that saddams 
invasion of kuwait and iraqi deception over how the 
hightemperature furnaces would be used resulted in losses for the 
industrial furnace builder and its sister company in scotland 
consarc of rancocas nj cited us assertions that the 
equipment could help give iraq the ability to make nuclear weapons 
two of the furnaces were to be shipped from the united states and 
two others from scotland

gov edward d diprete is proposing a 
wideranging campaign and ethics reforms 
diprete a republican promised thursday to ask the 
democratdominated general assembly to ban campaign contributions 
from state or municipal contractors and from corporations or labor 
unions he would cut maximum donations from others to 1000

parties and barring candidates from keeping surplus funds 
in addition diprete wants to bar candidates from making loans 
to their campaigns democratic opponent bruce g sundlun is a 
millionaire who has selffinanced most of the three campaigns he 
has run against diprete in six years 
dipretes voter approval ratings have dropped to around 20 
percent as the states economy has faltered surveys show likely 
voters choosing sundlun more because they dislike diprete and want

pete wilson courted hispanic voters by 
promising to consider seriously hispanics for appointments if he is 
elected governor while dianne feinstein unveiled an affordable 
housing plan 
though wilson made no promises of specific appointments 
thursday he pointed to his record as proof of his commitment to 
minority appointments he noted that as a us senator he had 
nominated women blacks and hispanics as federal judges 
but wilson remained firm in his opposition to hiring quotas an 
idea the senator says his democratic opponent once endorsed 
feinstein says she never wanted quotas contending her views on 
hiring goals were misunderstood 
in san francisco feinstein outlined policies she said would 
make the dream of owning your own home possible for more 
californians 
the former san francisco mayor said that as governor she would 
immediately tap 600 million in voterapproved bonds to build 
affordable housing 90 percent of which she said remain unspent 
that percentage was disputed by state officials 
actually the state department of housing and community 
development has spent 1519 million of the money after a delay 
caused by drafting regulations and hiring staff said department 
spokeswoman kathie parrish 
another 200 million is expected to be spent by years end and 
most of the money should be allocated by 1992 said parrish

iraq has successfully tested an 
intermediaterange ballistic missile loaded with chemical weapons 
a newspaper reported today 
during the test last year iraq fired a missile loaded with a 
chemical warfare agent the los angeles times said quoting arab 
and us officials it did not identify by name 
the test in northwestern iraq shows that the government of 
saddam hussein can carry out a chemical weapons attack using 
missiles with a range of 175 to nearly 600 miles the newspaper 
said 
such missiles could reach us forces deployed in saudi arabia 
no country has ever launched a missile attack with chemical 
weapons iraq combined the two after its war with iran ended in 
1988 
officials say such an attack would be far more difficult for 
iraq than waging chemical war with conventional aircraft 
it is an extremely complicated and difficult operation said 
geoffrey kemp a former national security council staff member 
it requires that you have a mechanism that releases the gas at 
the right altitude as the missile is reentering the atmosphere 
because missiles can travel farther and faster than aircraft and 
are more difficult to intercept the test is seen as a serious 
threat 
in response the united states has deployed patriot 
surfacetoair missiles to intercept iraqi missiles the newspaper 
said the us plan is to intercept the missiles at high altitude 
and disperse the gas before it reaches the ground it said 
three types of iraqi missiles are soviet made and described by a 
us air force official as inaccurate 
they could be useful against an area target but not against a 
highvalue military target he said 
highvalue military targets include radar installations and air 
fields an area target is a population center 
iraq used chemical warfare extensively in the eightyear war 
with iran and experts say that contributed to irans acceptance of 
a united nations settlement in 1988 officials say american troops 
are well trained in chemical warfare

romania is complying with united nations 
sanctions and has not imported oil from iraq the state department 
says contradicting its own internal study 
an unclassified state department report on compliance with the 
sanctions said that romania expects to receive oil indirectly 
from iraq the report was completed last friday and the 
associated press carried a story based on the study on tusday 
department spokesman richard boucher said thursday there is 
no truth to reports that the state department believes romania is 
importing iraqi oil or otherwise violating the sanctions 
in fact romania has been a strong supporter of the sanctions 
from the outset and has played a very positive role on a number of 
issues relating to the gulf crisis 
boucher did not mention it but romania has offered to refine 
oil for us forces in the middle east 
asked to elaborate on the discrepancy between the report and the 
public statement a state department official said information 
changes he asked not to be identified and declined further 
elaboration 
the cuban government also has denied a state department 
assertion in the report that cuba had received oil from iraq in 
circumvention of the sanctions 
boucher said that although there is no firm evidence that cuba 
has violated the sanctions iraqi oil was delivered to the port of 
matanzas on aug 25 
he said cuba claims that this is not a violation because the 
tanker was loaded and contracts signed prior to aug 6 when the 
un security council voted to embargo iraq 
weve expressed our concern to the government of cuba and said 
that as a security council member cuba should strictly abide by 
the embargo boucher said

has this ever happened to you you get 
the family rv loaded for an outing you manage to fit everything in 
just right then you discover a pesky radio bracket is somewhere 
you cant get to easily 
what do you do 
well if youre a member of the 265th quartermaster detachment 
you laugh some mutter some then unpack and repack the pickup 
truck for what seems to be the 15th time 
its no big deal the 14 men of the south carolina national 
guard unit have time to kill as they wait for a plane to take them 
to the mideast 
the latest word was that the water purification unit will leave 
this weekend there had been prior false alarms but this time the 
men treated the news seriously many of them stashed their families 
at post guest quarters or in offpost motels advertising discount 
rates for servicemen 
another indication that the men are short timers was a visit by 
maj gen t eston marchant south carolinas adjutant general 
marchant gave the unit the state flag with orders to fly it in 
the mideast and return it home safely 
im counting on you he said 
marchant also joked about the units reputation for card 
playing i want to know how long it will be before you have that 
casino set up in the desert he said 
that would be sgt cohens job sir said sgt ronnie 
jackson the units commander 
sgt hullie cohen who plays long games of cards in the barracks 
at night smiled and nodded 
cohen a former air force load handler and the other men spent 
the rest of the hot dusty day carfully loading and rearranging four 
sandcolored chevy custom deluxe fourwheel drives that will fly 
over to the mideast aboard the same plane as the men 
cohen showed how to segregate potentially dangerous materials 
like chemicals flares batteries and fire extinguishers into a 
separate pile 
if something happens in the plane you just drop the ramp and 
toss anything dangerous he said 
the slowpaced packing and repacking was supervised by sgt 
robert martin regular army sent to help the 265th prepare for 
overseas it was martin who pointed out the misplaced radio 
bracket 
you know what they do to messengers who bring bad news dont 
you sergeant asked sgt earnest deloach a cigar clamped in his 
mouth 
i look at it as constructive criticism martin said as he 
watched the work from his perch on a huge propane tank i get my 
butt chewed if this isnt done right this just makes it harder for 
me

the defense department estimates that the cost 
of the us invasion of panama last december was about 1636 
million a congressional report says 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress found in a report released thursday that the incremental 
cost for operation just cause was about 155 million for the army 
57 million for the air force and 29 million for the navy 
the invasion that began in the early morning hours dec 20 1989 
and lasted until jan 31 involved 27000 us troops including 
13000 who were stationed in panama 
the objective of operation just cause was to remove panamanian 
leader manuel noriega who had been indicted in the united states 
on drug charges 
the gao based its report on estimates from the military services 
and did not independently verify the numbers 
among the costs associated with operation just cause were 
expenses incurred prior to the invasion including practice 
missions and the price of evacuating military dependents 
other expenses included replacing aircraft and vehicles lost 
during the operation the price of ammunition and allowances paid 
to military personnel including imminent danger pay and family 
separation pay 
the release of the costs associated with the panama invasion 
comes as the bush administration is estimating that the us 
military buildup to deter iraqi aggression could cost as much as 
15 billion in the next fiscal year

a day after the postal service offered to 
deliver mail free from american military personnel in the middle 
east the pentagon said no 
military post offices collect the mail and then turn it over to 
postal officials for delivery in this country 
postmaster general anthony m frank had said wednesday that his 
agency was prepared to accept and deliver mail without stamps 
from personnel serving in operation desert shield 
but on thursday the defense department said letters without 
stamps cannot be accepted until congress and president bush approve 
the action the plan has passed the senate and is pending in the 
house 
the house had appeared poised to approve the plan overwhelmingly 
until rep thomas ridge rpa offered an amendment stipulating 
that money to pay for the free mail would come from appropriations 
for free franked mail by members of congress 
ridges proposal was rejected on a voice vote he then demanded 
a roll call vote and because the house had already agreed to hold 
no more recorded votes this week the members postponed action 
until next week 
pentagon spokesman glen flood said current law does not 
authorize free mail for deployed forces in situations short of 
hostilities we hope the full congress takes action soon but as of 
right now free mail is not authorized we hope that changes 
advised of the pentagon decision the postal service said that 
its announcement of free mail from troops in saudi arabia was 
made in the spirit and intent of proposed legislation 
the postal service stands ready to accept and deliver service

remarks by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan about the 
possibility of relaxing monetary policy if the white house and 
congress reach a us budget deficit reduction accord

selling to take profits between the spot and the futures market

warren burger former chief justice of the us 
supreme court says the confirmation process for david souter 
should not involve asking him for commitments on how he would vote 
are the types of questions senators are posing to the latest 
nominee subjecting him and the court to dangerous pressures from 
elected officials pressures which undermine the essential american 
idea of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary 
burger asked in an article he wrote for the sept 16 issue of 
parade magazine 
he continued now the question is whether the american people 
are witnessing a confirmation process in which specialinterest 
groups have flooded senators with questions demanding advance 
commitment from the nominee as to what his or her vote will be on 
some pet subject 
to expect a nominee to make commitments or even to engage in 
substantive discussion of a case yet unseen borders on the 
preposterous burger said 
the senate judiciary committee began confirmation hearings for 
souter on thursday

a un committee today allowed india to 
send food to its citizens trapped by iraqs invasion of kuwait the 
vote came hours after the security council set strict guidelines 
for exceptions to the trade embargo 
let us be frank there is food in iraq and kuwait but the 
iraqi authorities have chosen to deprive the most vulnerable 
elements of the civilian society pushing them to the brink of 
starvation us ambassdor thomas pickering said 
the security council voted 132 late thursday to allow food 
shipments to iraq or occupied kuwait only to relieve human 
suffering and said humanitarian organizations must distribute the 
aid 
the councils committee on sanctions met later and gave india 
permission to send a shipload of food to its 140000 citizens in 
iraq and occupied kuwait 
in line with the resolution just adopted the sanctions 
committee has approved the sailing of a ship from india to kuwait 
to assist indian and other nationals in kuwait and iraq pickering 
said 
under the un embargo passed four days after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait only medical supplies or in humanitarian 
circumstances foodstuffs may be sent to iraq or kuwait 
india and the philippines had appealed to the security councils 
sanctions committee for permission to send food to their people 
still stranded in iraq and kuwait 
iraq has said it will not feed the 140000 indians 93000 sri 
lankans and 60000 filipinos it holds but that they must rely on 
their governments 
the resolution passed late thursday night said the international 
committee of the red cross or other appropriate humanitarian 
agencies should distribute food or supervise its distribution 
that left open the possibility that the iraqi red crescent one 
of the moslem national charities that are members of the 
international red cross might be allowed to handle food 
distribution 
iraqi ambassador abdul alanbari said wednesday that only 
iraqi authorities could distribute food in his country 
india has said it would like to distribute the shipment of 
11000 tons of food it is sending to kuwait through its consulate 
pickering said un officials will be watching closely this 
shipment and its distribution 
the ship is expected to arrive in five to seven days 
the united states soviet union britain france finland and 
canada sponsored thursdays resolution which also attracted the 
votes of china colombia ethiopia ivory coast malaysia romania 
and zaire cuba and yemen voted against it 
the resolution contains a narrow interpretation of humanitarian 
circumstances requiring that human suffering be verified by 
independent experts 
under the resolution secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
woud seek information from un agencies and other humanitarian 
agencies on whether a desperate need for food exists in iraq or 
occupied kuwait 
while noting that the previous resolution permits the shipment 
of medical supplies and medicines the new resolution urges 
countries sending medicines or supplies to closely supervise their 
distribution 
thursdays resolution also insists baghdad is responsible for 
the safety and wellbeing of all foreigners it holds in 
accordance with international humanitarian law including where 
applicable the fourth geneva convention which protects the 
rights of civilians in territories under military occupation 
on thursday dutch customs thursday impounded a 
bahamianregistered ship which was apparently carrying iraqibound 
cargo in defiance of unimposed trade sanctions a spokeswoman 
for the prosecutors office said 
also thursday canadian external affairs minister joe clark 
confirmed canada has stopped shipment of a shipload of grain bound 
for iraq 
iraq complained that canada and australia halted delivery of 
120000 tons of wheat purchased before the un embargo 
for it to have gone through to iraq would have meant in our 
judgment a break of the un policy clark said in toronto

more american women over 40 are having mammograms 
to check for breast cancer but most dont have them frequently 
enough a new survey shows 
the survey conducted earlier this year and reported thursday by 
the centers for disease control found that 64 percent of women 40 
and older had undergone a mammogram up sharply from 37 percent in 
a similar survey in 1987 
but only 31 percent in the new survey followed the recommended 
mammography schedule one every year or two for women in their 40s 
and once a year thereafter 
researchers said problems appear to be doctors who dont tell 
their patients to have mammograms and patients who dont think 
they need them 
fortyfive percent of the women who had never had a mammogram 
said it was because no doctor ever told them to 
doctors are going to have to do a much better job of 
recommending that women get mammograms and get them on a regular 
schedule dr douglas marchant said in a statement from the 
american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
the colleges jacobs institute of womens health commissioned 
the study which was conducted with the national cancer institute 
forty percent of the women who had never had a mammogram said 
they werent at risk because no one in their family had been a 
breast cancer patient 
for years weve been telling women look if you have a 
history of breast cancer in your family you need a mammogram but 
women have translated that as if you dont you dont said dr 
sharyn sutton of the cancer institute a coauthor of the study 
among the women who had received only one mammogram in their 
lives 35 percent believed that because it was negative they didnt 
need another 
clearly we need to help women understand the role of 
mammograms in routine preventive health care marchant said 
and we need to emphasize that a single mammogram is of little 
benefit 
researchers also found that as age goes up compliance with 
mammography recommendations goes down while about 40 percent of 
the women in their 40s got mammograms every year or two as 
recommended fewer than 20 percent in their 70s got their yearly 
tests 
its directly opposite to their increased risk sutton said 
people perceive cancer as a disease you get at 55 or 65 and once 
youre older than that you got by you escaped i dont think 
older women understand that you dont escape you need to keep 
going back every year 
the survey also found that nearly 40 percent of the women 
questioned said mammograms cost too much and half said they 
wouldnt pay as much as 150 for an annual mammogram 
mammograms can cost from 50 to 250 although most are 100 to 
125 said dr marion nadel a cdc cancer specialist the cdc noted 
that 29 states require insurance companies to provide some level of 
mammography coverage 
researchers estimate that 44000 american women will die this 
year of breast cancer previous studies have estimated that breast 
cancer death rates could be lowered 30 percent if women received 
mammograms as recommended by the nci the american cancer society 
and other groups 
the survey questioned 980 women in a national sampling with a 
margin of error of about 3 percent

george mcfarland the chubby child star 
spanky of our gang and little rascals wants about 100000 
from a saloon that he says used his name and face for 13 years 
without permission 
federal judge james rosenbaum on thursday ordered the saloon not 
to use the visage or name of spanky its not enough for 
mcfarland 
in march seven months after mcfarland filed a lawsuit the 
owner of the bar changed its name from spankys saloon to checkers 
nightclub 
drawings of a roundfaced kid wearing a beanie came down from 
the front of the building and from interior walls patrons no 
longer could buy jackets tshirts and hats imprinted with the 
spankys saloon logo 
other businesses pay the mcfarland 62 who lives in fort worth 
texas for the right to use his name and childhood face mcfarland 
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former 
coowner of the st paul bar 
hes after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and 
thats an exorbitant amount of money even if they did something 
wrong said dennis johnson a lawyer for the bars former owner 
michael kalis 
kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner walter 
engelhardt in 1982 
johnson and engelhardt who represented himself in court 
contend that the bars name had little to do with its business and 
that the connection with mcfarland was unintentional 
marshall tanick a minneapolis attorney representing mcfarland 
said they denied his client his legitimate livelihood he said the 
spanky name and image are mcfarlands meal ticket 
tanick also accused the bar owners of tarnishing mcfarlands 
name by associating it with heavy metal bands that perform at the 
bar mcfarland was shocked when he discovered his name had been 
linked to such bands as raw meat primal scream and blue 
murder tanick said in court papers 
spankys wholesome appeal particularly to families and 
children is debased by associating him with these morbid 
musicians the lawsuit contended 
in addition to 13 years of licensing fees and legal costs 
mcfarland also wants all the merchandise and bar equipment 
featuring the spankys logo 
rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the 
merchandise and took mcfarlands other claims under advisement

police eliminated the doe gang without firing 
a single shot 
for 17 days the pekin daily news blamed nearly every crime in 
this illinois river city on john jane and assorted other does to 
protest the police departments refusal to identify people 
arrested 
police agreed to reveal real names and the newspapers doe watch 
has come to an end 
the doe family was a ficticious creation of the police as a 
way to shield the names of people arrested each day said kent r 
davy the times managing editor apparently it was the historic 
practice of the pekin police to shield the names of those arrested 
by listing them as john doe or jane doe 
police chief jack leuck scrapped the secrecy policy sept 4 
allowing the times to print the names of everyone arrested daily 
after city lawyers advised him the department may be violating 
state law 
leuck a retired fbi agent said he took over a year ago and was 
told the policy had been in effect at least 15 years he said the 
police changed suspects names to doe to protect anyone who was not 
formally charged 
sometimes we pick someone up and the victim decides not to 
press charges he said people change their story or make 
things up and we end up releasing the individual who was arrested 
if that arrest is reported it can cause an individual irreparable 
harm 
davy a lawyer and former assistant prosecutor in guam sees it 
differently he said abuses could occur if police arrest records 
are kept secret in the city of 34000 people near peoria in 
central illinois 
people ought not be whisked away and jailed without the public 
knowing davy said in an editorial people of position and 
influence ought not to be able to avoid prosecution after an arrest 
without everyone knowing

japan today earmarked an additional 3 billion for 
international forces in the persian gulf region and for nations 
suffering from the un embargo on iraq 
the government accused of being slow and miserly in providing 
such support said the new funding will bring japans total aid 
toward meeting the gulf crisis to more than 4 billion 
the united states has complained japan was not contributing 
enough especially considering its high dependence on middle east 
oil the house of representatives made its displeasure known in a 
resolution wednesday calling for japan to pay all expenses of 
american troops based in japan 
if they had known the magnitude of the total package of 
contribution measures which we have announced today they would 
know how serious japan is in trying to cooperate with the united 
states and other countries in keeping the peace and security in 
that region even at the sacrifice of our own fiances foreign 
ministry spokesman taizo watanabe told reporters 
chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said prime minister 
toshiki kaifu had phoned president bush to notify him of the 
expanded contribution 
president bush expressed deep appreciation and told kaifu that 
he will tell his people that japan is playing an active role in the 
international effort in the gulf sakamoto told reporters 
sakamoto said japan would provide up to 1 billion to the 
usled forces deployed in the gulf region after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of kuwait japan on aug 29 had pledged 1 billion 
another 2 billion would go to such countries as egypt jordan 
and turkey facing difficulties from joining in the un economic 
embargo imposed against iraq he added 
sakamoto said japan would give 600 million immediately to those 
three nations as an exceptional measure in the form of a loan 
at 1 percent annual interest repayable in 30 years 
japan would decide how to provide the additional 14 billion 
depending on how the situation develops he added 
the 4 billion total figure matched the contribution that 
japanese media reports said the united states was demanding from 
japan 
watanabe said however it was our own decision 
sakamoto said the expanded contribution was the maximum japan 
could provide at this point 
responding to criticism that japan had acted slowly watanabe 
said japan had constitutional and legal restraints against sending 
military forces overseas he said tokyo had not been consulted on 
operational details for the multinational peacekeeping forces in 
the gulf although it was willing to cooperate with them 
therefore when we are asked to pay the bill we have to check 
the contents of the invoice and we have to examine what is the 
real thinking behind it that is something quite natural he 
said 
on wednesday the us house approved 370 to 53 a resolution 
stating that the united states would withdraw 5000 us troops 
each year from japan until tokyo agrees to pay the full cost of all 
50000 troops now stationed in japan the resolution has not been 
passed by the senate 
the united states spends 45 billion annually for the us 
forces in japan while japan currently contributes about 29 
billion

the author of a new book claims the jewish prophet 
moses was known to ancient egyptians as ikhnaton the ruler and 
religious reformer 
i am convinced that i have identified moses as ikhnaton the 
prophet poet and king in the 14th century bc who shut the 
temples of the ancient gods sent the priests home and declared 
there was only one god said ahmed osman 
his book moses pharaoh of egypt was published in britain 
on thursday by grafton books the us rights are under 
negotiation 
osmans first book in 1987 stranger in the valley of kings 
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named yuya was joseph 
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe 
of israel into egypt 
osman 55 an egyptian who has pursued research in egyptology 
and the bible in london for 25 years is regarded by academics as a 
controversial but respected outsider 
younes ahmed elbatrik cultural counselor at the egyptian 
embassy held a reception thursday night to launch osmans book 
its a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and 
i will be interested to hear what the experts say about it he 
said 
in identifying moses with ikhnaton osman builds on sigmund 
freuds last book moses and monotheism in which the father of 
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the 
two ancients 
sydney leperer a senior history lecturer at jews college 
university of london said of osmans ikhnatonmoses theory 
there is a faint possibility that it is true although i have my 
doubts 
donald b redford professor of near eastern studies at toronto 
university and an expert on ikhnaton scoffed at the theory 
there is no evidence that ikhnaton was a man called moses and 
the religious teachings of ikhnaton have nothing to do with moses 
who appears to have lived five centuries after him or longer 
redford said in a telephone interview 
naim dangoor editor of the scribe a journal on babylonian 
jewry said he had read and reviewed both of osmans books osman 
knows a great deal about the period and his theories invite 
further investigation dangoor said 
osman said in an interview that scholars had always had 
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures 
in the old testament and egyptian history 
i believe that moses had an israelite mother and an egyptian 
father he said 
he was the son of pharaoh amenhotep iii and queen tiye 
daughter of joseph the patriarch tiyes first son had mysteriously 
disappeared so when moses was born tiye sent him by water for 
safekeeping to her israelite relatives i think that was the origin 
of the story that moses was found in the bulrushes on the nile 
after 17 years as pharaoh ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by 
the boy prince tutankhamen 
i believe ikhnaton survived and went into exile in sinai with 
a few followers osman said when the oppressor pharaoh 
horemheb died ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as 
there was no heir he challenged horemhebs general ramses for 
the throne but ramses attacked him and forced him to flee the 
flight was the exodus in 1333 bc 
ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter canaan the 
promised land but were slaughtered by ramses successor seti i 
this fight is recorded in the temple of karnak in luxor the 
author said 
jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between 
moses and egypt because of memories of the oppression osman 
believes however the talmud the jewish law indicates that 
moses became a king and was forced to abdicate he added 
eric uphill an egyptologist at londons university college 
said he helped and supported osmans research because he regarded 
osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge 
osmans manuscript was based on the right sources for egyptian 
history uphill said but he would not comment on the conclusions 
without further study 
the problem with moses is that the historical truth about him 
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories some of them 
haywire leperer said 
dangoor said moses death is a mystery that is not resolved in 
the exodus accounts osmans explanation that he was killed by 
seti i is very plausible dangoor said

prime ministers home today demanding the killers be arrested 
we will not go until we get justice cried 50yearold gopi 
kaur who lost 12 male relatives including her husband and 
brothers in the violence 
her outburst was supported by a religious battle cry shouted by 
the other women outside the residence of prime minister vp singh 
most of them wore white the color of mourning for sikh and hindu 
widows 
more than 2000 sikhs were killed in new delhi alone in 
antisikh rioting after prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by two sikh bodyguards oct 31 1984 about 700 sikhs 
were killed in similar riots across the nation 
many sikhs as well as human rights groups blamed the killings 
of sikhs on members of mrs gandhis congress party assisted by 
hired toughs 
only 11 of the 225 people charged with murder and looting have 
been convicted three special courts have been set up in new delhi 
to deal with the cases but their progress has bogged down in legal 
and bureaucratic wrangles 
todays protest was sparked by the governments failure tuesday 
to arrest a prominent local congress party leader sajjan kumar a 
police party that went to kumars house to make the arrest returned 
emptyhanded after thousands of kumars supporters surrounded the 
house and threatened to lynch the officers 
the mob wrecked two cars of the police officials and blocked 
traffic for several hours in the meantime kumar obtained a delhi 
high court order that would grant bail in event of his arrest in 
connection with a murder case 
we are pained that sajjan kumar has escaped arrest by 
strongarm tactics and through musclepower by indulging in 
violence the protest organizers the all india sikh conference 
said in a letter to the prime minister a copy was given to 
reporters 
sikhs and human rights activists have accused kumar of 
personally leading death squads in the aftermath of mrs gandhis 
assassination 
the women accused mrs gandhis son rajiv gandhi of stalling 
the prosecution during his term as prime minister between 1984 and 
1989 
but we derive confidence that in your regime justice will not 
be denied any longer the sikhs said in their letter to singh 
who succeeded gandhi in december 1989 
many of the sikh victims were hacked tortured and burned to 
death with blazing car tires jammed over their shoulders

relatives or guardians of braindamaged 
people can order the removal of feeding tubes that keep them alive 
the florida supreme court said in a ruling hailed by 
righttodie advocates 
it reaffirms the rights of floridians under our state 
constitution to make their own decisions about what will be done 
with their bodies said charlene carres a tallahassee attorney 
for the american civil liberties union 
roman catholics antiabortion groups and other opponents did 
not immediately respond saying they needed more time to review the 
ruling 
the decision focused on an elderly woman who died last summer 
estelle browning spent the last 2 years of her life hooked up to 
feeding tubes that she had specified in a living will she 
didnt want 
mrs browning suffered permanent brain damage in a stroke and 
was left in a persistent vegetative state unable to swallow or 
communicate she was not comatose doris herbert mrs brownings 
second cousin and only living relative was named her guardian 
herbert sought permission to remove the tubes in 1988 the state 
fought the request and a trial court denied it but a state appeals 
court said the florida constitution allowed for removal of the 
tubes and the issue was reviewed by the supreme court 
we hold that because mrs browning was unable to exercise her 
constitutional right of privacy by reason of her medical condition 
her guardian was authorized to exercise it for her justice 
rosemary barkett wrote 
when people take the time and trouble to write living 
wills express their wishes orally or appoint healthcare 
surrogates theres no need to go before a judge to get permission 
to carry out their wishes the court ruled 
patricia dore a law professor at florida state university who 
drafted the privacy clause added to the state constitution in 1980 
said it was significant that the justices ruled there was no legal 
distinction between food and water supplied through tubes and other 
medical treatments like respirators 
although it has no direct impact outside florida attorneys and 
advocates said other state courts could be influenced by the case 
i think many many state courts look to florida for guidance 
on issues that affect the elderly said george felos an attorney 
who represented herbert 
floridas high court heard oral arguments in the case in 
january six months later the us supreme court said a missouri 
couple could not order the removal of food and water keeping their 
32yearold comatose daughter alive 
the daughter nancy cruzan had not left a living will her 
parents said they were certain she would prefer to die rather than 
live in a coma in its split decision the nations high court said 
competent people have a right to refuse medical treatment

camouflage uniforms worn by american troops 
in saudi arabia are made for cooler climates not searing desert 
heat military and clothing industry officials say 
the problem is the hot weather uniform made entirely of cotton 
doesnt have the desert camouflage pattern 
the uniform worn by troops is made of the same material half 
nylon and half cotton that was criticized as hot and 
uncomfortable by american soldiers during the 1982 invasion of 
grenada 
weather conditions are much harsher in the saudi desert than in 
grenada daytime temperatures have gone as high as 120 degrees 
since us forces were sent there in august after iraq invaded 
kuwait 
jeffrey j weinsten former chairman of an american apparel 
manufacturers association committee that oversees government 
contracts said the allcotton uniform is more comfortable than the 
blend because cotton is a moistureloving fabric that licks away 
perspiration 
the blend is not absorbent at all he said 
the allcotton uniform breathes better because it has a more 
open weave but its hard to find in the desert camouflage pattern 
weinsten said 
frank johnson a spokesman for the defense personnel support 
center in philadelphia said there are no hotweather uniforms in 
the desert pattern because the powers that be said if there is a 
war it would probably involve the warsaw pact in europe 
obviously we didnt figure on something like this breaking out 
in the middle east johnson said 
johnson defended the choice of uniforms saying the camouflage 
version is more durable than the cotton version weinsten agreed 
the blend fabric has greater strength and can resist desert sand 
better but said comfort is more important 
allcotton desert uniforms make sense said philip m cavanaugh 
director of the quartermaster museum at the army logistics center 
at fort lee its what they should have done to begin with he 
said 
asked why the desert camouflage pattern wasnt printed on cotton 
uniforms col john duff deputy commander at the armys research 
development and engineering center in natick mass where the 
uniform was developed said i wouldnt touch that with a 10foot 
pole 
chemical weapons suits us troops have in the saudi desert are 
so heavy and unbearable that the marines have replaced them with a 
lighterweight britishmade model a military spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity

comedy actress athene seyler whose stage movie 
and radio career spanned most of this century has died her family 
reported she was 101 
she died at her home in london on wednesday her family said 
they did not give details on funeral arrangements 
said by one theater critic to resemble an irritable 
hippopotamus on stage she was recognized in the acting 
profession as one of the great technical experts on high comedy 
she specialized in playing quirky queens and crusty dowagers 
with plummy voices and quivering chins she especially favored the 
plays of william congreve oscar wilde william wycherley and 
richard sheridan 
critic james agate once said that when it came to comedy she 
could act any other english actress off the stage 
her plain looks generally ruled out romantic roles but combined 
with her sharp intelligence and vitality proved a considerable 
comic asset 
in later life she was mockingly critical of playwrights and 
directors alike 
of harold pinters 1975 play no mans land she remarked 
i couldnt follow a word of it when one of the characters 
yawned i said oh i do so agree rather too loudly and people in 
the audience turned and stared at me 
she made her london stage debut in 1909 but it was not until 
1920 when she played rosalind in shakespeares as you like it 
that her special talent for high comedy first showed 
she appeared in almost 20 movies including quiet wedding in 
1940 dear octopus in 1943 nicholas nickleby in 1947 and 
pickwick papers in 1952 
her last major stage appearance was in 1966 at the age of 77 in 
a memorable revival of the comedy arsenic and old lace in which 
she costarred with dame sybil thorndike she continued working on 
radio until she was well into her late 80s 
her first husband was newspaper editor james bury 
sterndalebennett by whom she had a daughter her second husband 
actor nicholas hannen died in 1972

former president ronald reagan today said 
us troops in berlin played an important role in the movements to 
democracy in eastern europe 
reagan spoke to about 1000 american military people and 
dependents at tempelhof airport before flying to poland the second 
stop on his 10day trip that also includes a visit to the soviet 
union 
nowhere have the events been more dramatic than here in 
berlin reagan said to the largely military audience on the 
airport tarmac in front of two old planes that flew food to west 
berlin during the soviet blockade more than four decades ago 
what you are doing here played an important role in the events 
of nov 9 reagan said referring to the day the berlin wall was 
opened last year 
as a souvenir us ambassador vernon walters gave the former 
president one of the berlin sector division signs that said in four 
languages you are leaving the american sector

presidential library in simi valley calif 
while in berlin reagan used a hammer and chisel on the berlin 
wall taking symbolic whacks at the old cold war barrier and also 
visited bonn the west german capital where he met chancellor

us roman catholic bishops have postponed 
action on a divisive pastoral letter about women and plan extensive 
international consultations that make its fate highly uncertain 
the decision thursday by the bishops administrative committee 
will mean a prolonged delay in final action on the letter if not 
its ultimate scuttling as some critics have demanded 
the letter in the works for five years had been scheduled for 
action in november by the fall meeting of the national conference 
of catholic bishops 
the conference president archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of 
cincinnati said the letter would only be discussed then as an 
information item and would not be considered for action 
athough not binding pastoral letters are circulated among 
catholic churches and serve as a guide for educational efforts 
preaching and the training of semarians 
the letter is called one in jesus christ a pastoral response 
to the concerns of women for church and society 
pilarczyk said the vatican had suggested consultating bishops 
outside the united states before acting on it because of the 
significance of the topic and influence of the us church 
our conference deems such a recommendation a wise one 
pilarczyk said 
last month the leadership conference of women religious 
comprised of 800 heads of womens religious orders asked that the 
proposed letter be dropped calling it intrinsically 
contradictory 
other catholic organizations and some bishops also had 
criticized the declaration as seeming to uphold equality for women 
yet hedging it and continuing to defend their exclusion from 
ordination to the priesthood 
the latest 99page draft released in march says men and women 
are equal in dignity and women should have more equitiable 
roles in leadership ministry teaching and policymaking in 
the church 
however the draft reiterated the churchs ban against ordaining 
women and defended limiting the priesthood to men as the practice 
of jesus and his apostles 
leaders of the nuns organizations said the letters position on 
equality was undermined and contradicted in its internal 
development especially in repeating the prohibition to womens 
ordination 
a bishops committee headed by bishop joseph imesch of joliet 
ill held hearings for several years across the country seeking 
input from women about the letter the latest revisions failed to 
satisfy its critics 
dear bishops you embarass us said liberal catholic 
theologian rosemary radford reuther you insult our 
intelligence 
she said the proposed letter criticizes sexism but reaffirms 
every aspect of the patriarchal system that is the basis of 
sexism 
an independent catholic study center the washingtonbased 
center of concern also had urged the bishops to scrap the letter 
it is easy to see the bind the authors are in said 
milwaukee arcbbishop rembert weakland a staunch advocate of a 
greater womens role in the church alluding to the vaticans 
position against womens ordination 
he said the very crediblity of the document comes into 
question in reprimanding society for inequalities and calling for 
struggle against sexism then upholding church policies that 
reflect it

iraq will begin rationing bread beginning 
saturday the ruling partys newspaper reported today adding to a 
list of other basic food items being limited since a un embargo 
began 
the ministry of trade ordered all bakeries and bread shops on 
saturday to observe the rationing announced earlier this month 
which limits bread to three pieces per person per day the baath 
party newspaper altharawa reported 
iraqis must present bread coupons to designated bread shops to 
receive their allocations altharwa said 
according to the rationing system each iraqi will have access 
to 132 pounds of wheat flour each month in the form of flour or 
bread 
large lines have formed at bread shops since the unimposed 
economic embargo against iraq and kuwait in reaction to the iraqi 
invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
iraq also has imposed a rationing system for other basic food 
items such as rice sugar and cooking oil as well as soap and 
detergent 
president saddam hussein also has asked iraqis to cut back on 
their consumption of meat and to prepare for belttightening to 
cope with the unimposed trade embargo 
the embargo prevents the import of goods as well as the export 
of oil iraqs chief source of revenue

an iraqi airways charter jet flew to kuwait 
city today to pick up about 400 americans scheduled to fly home 
from baghdad later in the day a us embassy official said 
the americans trapped in kuwait since last months iraqi 
invasion will stop in baghdad to receive exit visas before 
changing charter flights and continuing to london the diplomat 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the flight is scheduled to take women children and american men 
of arab origin the official said eighteen britons also would be 
among the westerners on board the foreign office in london said 
since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait prompted us and other 
forces to deploy in the persian gulf region iraq has held 
americans and other westerners as human shields at potential 
military targets 
however late last month baghdad agreed to begin releasing 
mostly women and children 
the us embassy official said he hoped the boeing 747 
chartered by the us government would leave baghdad around 6 pm 
10 am edt however delays have been the norm in previous 
flight evacuating westerners from kuwait and iraq 
it would be the second time in three days that a flight brought 
westerners out of iraq 
on wednesday 288 americans 70 britons and 70 people of other 
nationalities left iraq aboard a jumbo jet jointly chartered by the 
american and british governments officials earlier said the flight 
carried 300 americans no explanation was given for the 
discrepancy 
a separate flight the same day took 10 ailing and elderly 
italian men to rome 
the voice of america the us governmentrun shortwave radio 
network has been broadcasting appeals to american women and 
children in kuwait to join the evacuation flight or another one 
planned for saturday the embassy official said he did not know 
how many evacuees might take the saturday flight 
about 6500 westerners remain stranded in iraq and kuwait many 
of them in hiding 
they are believed to include about 1500 americans in kuwait 
according to the us embassy official in baghdad at least 2500 
americans were in kuwait at the time of the iraqi invasion the 
official said 
palestinian diplomats in baghdad said late thursday that an 
estimated 1000 palestinians a day who had fled after the invasion 
are returning to kuwait the diplomats did not have a total on the 
number of palestinians who had returned

retail sales slumped 06 percent in august 
despite a huge jump in gasoline station purchases the government 
said today in its first report on consumer spending since the 
persian gulf crisis eruped aug 2 
some analysts had said in advance that the report would be 
skewed by sharply higher gasoline prices that would offset falling 
sales elsewhere indeed sales in nearly all other categories 
declined 
much of the increase in gasoline sales apparently represented 
increased prices rather than volume the american petroleum 
institute said gasoline prices rose about 20 percent since iraq 
overran kuwait on aug 2 
the commerce department said overall sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1492 billion down from 1500 billion in july the july 
sales which rose 04 percent turned out to be stronger than the 
01 percent gain originally reported last month 
but a 11 percent advance in june had been the first increase 
since last january and analysts worried whether developments in the 
middle east would jack up prices and erode consumer confidence 
driving sales back down 
indeed two major consumer confidence surveys one conducted by 
the conference board in new york and another by the university of 
michigan plummeted after iraq invaded kuwait 
since consumer spending represents twothirds of the nations 
economic activity there was concern a dropoff could help push the 
nation into a recession retail sales account for about half of 
overall consumer spending 
the commerce report said gasoline station sales jumped 64 
percent in august the largest increase since an 83 percent 
advance in august 1979 
excluding the gasoline category retail sales tumbled even 
farther down 11 percent 
automobile sales fell 43 percent their largest drop since a 
56 percent decrease last january excluding the automobile 
category sales would have risen 04 percent 
sales of durable goods which includes cars and other items 
expected to last more than three years slid 26 percent after 
rising 07 percent the previous month 
besides automobiles other components of the durable category 
were mixed sales of building materials were off 24 percent while 
sales of furniture and other home furnishings rose 07 percent 
nondurable goods which include food and gasoline rose 06 
percent following julys 03 percent gain 
but other than gasoline all other nondurable categories fell 
sales at department stores were down 02 percent grocery 
stores off 02 percent clothing stores down 09 percent 
restaurants and bars off 07 percent and drug stores down 05 
percent

searchers began a second day of picking 
through swamps bush and wooded areas this morning near the 
apartment of a suspect in the slayings of five college students 
police said 
some objects were found during thursdays first day of hunting 
but there was no immediate word on whether they were connected to 
the case said alachua county sheriffs office spokesman lt 
spencer mann 
the search party was combing 10 square miles near the residence 
of university of florida freshman edward lewis humphrey one of 
eight suspects in the slayings 
its a long slow process mann said 
searchers included florida national guardsmen sailors from the 
orlando naval training center military reserve officers and police 
from state and local agencies two helicopters aided searchers in 
thursdays 90degree heat and about 10 dog teams were called in 
the dog teams were looking for body parts from the five victims 
but mann said such parts might already have decayed in the three 
weeks since the bodies of the students were discovered 
some searchers carried metal detectors and rods for probing the 
ground the work was expected to be wrapped up later today 
officials said 
meanwhile two agents with the florida department of law 
enforcement began what the agency calls an executive 
investigation aimed at learning who has been leaking information 
to reporters 
liedetector tests may be used and those found to have given out 
unauthorized information could face disciplinary action and 
criminal charges said police spokeswoman lt sadie darnell 
police say the leaks have hurt their investigation 
once again thursday police were secretive about their progress 
and refused to comment on reports their case may have been badly 
compromised when investigators first interrogated humphrey 18 
following his arrest on charges of assaulting his grandmother 
a series of newspaper reports have said humphrey was questioned 
in the brevard county jail without an attorney present and the 
public defenders who finally showed up were sent away when 
prosecutors dropped the assault charges only to refile them when 
the lawyers left 
humphrey was not brought to court until 36 hours after he was 
taken into custody 
humphrey who is being treated by a doctor for manicdepressive 
disorder reportedly implicated one of his multiple personalities 
in the slayings and told police where to look for some evidence 
humphrey remains jailed in the aug 30 beating of his 
grandmother he also faces warrants in an october 1988 armed 
burglary and attempted rape in indian river county and an aug 25 
assault on two male university students 
the mutilated bodies of sonja larson 18 and christina powell 
17 were found aug 26 in their offcampus apartment the next 
morning christa hoyt 18 was found decapitated in her nearby 
duplex manuel taboada and tracy paules both 23 were found dead 
aug 28 in another nearby apartment 
all were students either at the university of florida or santa 
fe community college

and the state of florida have agreed to share the cost of a 120 
million plan to clean up the everglades and lake okeechobee

management district about 74000 acres of farmland are to be 
bought and converted into marshes to filter phosphorusladen 
agricultural runoff blamed for much of the pollution plaguing the 
lake okeechobeeeverglades system 
water flowing south from farm fields would be cleaned by running 
it through the marshes where plants would absorb excess phosphorus 
blamed for upsetting the everglades ecosystem 
its very historic that everybody came to the table and agreed 
to pay for this said ann overton a spokeswoman for the water 
district its a big step forward 
environmentalists involved in a 27month effort to reach the 
accord criticized the sugar industrys 40 million share as too 
low 
and the question of whether the federal government will now drop 
a pollution lawsuit against the state and the water district 
remained unanswered 
the lawsuit filed by miami us attorney dexter lehtinen 
contends water managers and the state allowed federal parks in the 
region to be degraded in violation of pollution laws and signed 
agreements 
in washington justice department spokeswoman amy casner said 
the government had no immediate comment on whether the plan was 
enough of a step forward for the federal government to drop the 
lawsuit 
on tuesday gov bob martinez worked out and approved the 
compromise despite estimates that the cleanup could end up costing 
as much as 500 million 
i think the majority of the industry decided that this may be 
as good as the deal was going to get theyd better take it said 
andy rackley vice president of the florida sugar cane league 
under the plan the everglades cleanup area would be quadrupled 
with the cost split into equal 40 million shares for the state 
government the water district and sugar growers 
i dont think that that necessarily represents a fair 
contribution from agriculture it may be but there are too many 
unknowns for us to be capping any contributor said doran jason 
a member of the water districts board 
environmentalists agreed 
you are making a statement that it is appropriate to allow an 
industry that is causing a number of environmental problems to pay 
something like 10 percent of the amount it will take to solve the 
problems said charles lee executive vice president of the 
florida audubon society

syrian president hafez assad an ally of 
the united states against iraq is likely to send another 15000 
troops to help defend saudi arabia western diplomatic sources said 
today 
the syrians have about 3000 soldiers in saudi arabia and 
another 1000 in the united arab emirates they are part of an 
international force from some two dozen countries that includes 
about 200000 american soldiers 
secretary of state james a baker iii who raised 12 billion 
last week from the saudis the united arab emirates and the kuwaiti 
regime ousted by iraq met with assad to plot further cooperation 
with damascus despite us accusations that syria promotes 
terrorism 
the talks were frank clear and centered on the situation in 
the gulf the peace process in the middle east and bilateral 
issues assad spokesman jibrane kourieh said after the 4hour 
session 
he gave no other details but the talks were believed to include 
irans growing belligerence in the standoff 
the additional troops probably will be accompanied by syrian 
tanks and may be transported by the soviet union which also 
supports the us attempt to reverse iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the syrians will be compensated by the saudis and other rich 
persian gulf countries said the sources who briefed reporters on 
condition of anonymity 
assad has long been at odds with iraqi president saddam hussein 
the crisis in the gulf gives assad a chance to confront the iraqi 
leader and gain favor with the bush administration at the same 
time 
assad wants the administration to join the soviets in calling 
for a middle east peace conference with the aim of creating a 
palestinian state and forcing israel to relinquish the golan 
heights to syria 
israel captured the territory in the 1967 middle east war and 
has annexed it until then attacks on villages in northern israel 
from the golan heights were frequent 
over the last two weeks president bush and baker have made a 
point of saying they might support an international peace 
conference at an appropriate time 
baker on thursday leveled a veiled warning against iran as he 
arrived here for talks with assad and syrian foreign minister faruq 
al shara 
responding to a threatened holy war against us forces in 
saudi arabia baker said the us troops were defending the saudi 
oil fields along with arab moslem nations 
the threats obviously are of deep concern baker said as he 
flew here from moscow we are not indifferent to threats against 
our forces 
his remarks were in response to a call by the ayatollah ali 
khamanei the iranian spiritual leader for a holy war against the 
us troops it raised fears of suicide raids against the americans 
as well as questions about irans position in the economic war of 
attrition against saddam hussein 
the administration banking on syria and irans longstanding 
hostility with iraq solicited the two countries to assist in the 
antiiraqi campaign 
syria which is on iraqs northern border has responded with 
troops and played a leading role in the arab league in condemning 
the iraqi invasion 
but iran has repaired relations with iraq with which it fought 
an eightyear war until 1988 after endorsing the un security 
councils call for an economic boycott 
we are watching it closely and believe it is holding baker 
said of iranian adherence to the sanctions ordered aug 2 
baker said interception under the sanctions of illicit cargo by 
sea may be expanded to aerial enforcement 
bakers visit to damascus is the first by a secretary of state 
since george p shultz came here in june 1988 to sound out assad on 
prospects for arabisraeli negotiations 
the state department has sharply criticized syrias human rights 
record and kept it on a list of seven countries accused of 
sponsoring terrorism 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine general 
command which has strong ties to syria is suspected in the 
december 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 over lockerbie 
scotland the disaster took 280 lives

most of the arsenal used in a failed coup attempt 
in trinidad by moslem extremists was purchased at gun shows and 
shops throughout south florida says a complaint against the 
alleged chief supplier 
louis haneef of pompano beach was arrested early thursday during 
a raid on his home said federal agents 
the federal complaint against haneef also includes a warrant for 
the leader of the revolt yasin abu bakr a former trinidad 
policeman who took the island nations prime minister prisoner for 
six days in july before surrendering 
of the 135 weapons confiscated in trinidad after the revolt 
collapsed 105 were traced to purchases made in florida by haneef 
said joe vince assistant special agent in charge of the miami 
office of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms 
he was supplying the weapons that were used in the 
insurrection there is no question about it the agent said 
the arrest shows the united states will not tolerate gun 
smuggling said miamis us attorney dexter lehtinen 
we are no longer going to allow south florida to be used as a 
mecca for people to purchase weapons to be used for narcotics 
traffickers or people planning rebellions anywhere in the 
caribbean or in the americas lehtinen said 
haneef bought at least 200 assault rifles and other firearms and 
the atf is seeking the missing guns said vince he also purchased 
250000 rounds of ammunition along with electronic equipment that 
included handheld radios 
one key question was where haneef obtained the approximately 
100000 in 100 bills he used to buy the weapons in dade and 
broward county gun shows and weapons shops vince said 
trinidad officials said bakr and many of his men had visited 
libya and received training and money there although they have 
found no evidence moammar gadhafi was behind the coup attempt 
haneefs money was drawn on a bank in the persian gulf nation of 
bahrain but its original source was still part of the 
investigation he said 
the federal complaint along with haneef and bakr names billaal 
abdullah another leader of the revolt and riad ali both of whom 
are also imprisoned in trinidad 
haneef was originally from st louis and changed his name from 
louis cole when he became a moslem vince said he added that the 
complaint would eventually be presented to a grand jury for 
indictments 
the men are accused of gun control and arms export violations 
said vince 
the investigation began in october 1989 when a miami police 
officer became suspicious of large gun purchases haneef made at a 
weapons show according to an affidavit by atf agent thomas bailey 
haneef was interviewed and said the weapons were for a gun club 
but the agency began surveillance he ultimately bought about 200 
weapons including ak47 and ruger mini14 assault rifles 
shotguns m1 carbines and largecaliber pistols 
the weapons and ammunition were allegedly smuggled out of the 
united states in april aboard a freighter hidden in hollowedout 
wall boards vince said he said investigators had obtained a 
warrant in hopes of placing an electronic tracer on the shipment 
but it had left port before they got there 
the rebellion in trinidad broke out in july when bakrs forces 
seized the parliament house and state television holding hostages 
including prime minister arthur nr robinson and other government 
leaders 
they demanded robinsons resignation new elections and amnesty 
but eventually surrendered on the sixth day of the crisis bakr and 
other revolt leaders are now in jail facing treason murder and 
other charges 
vince said he did not expect bakr to be extradited to miami but 
said the warrants would remain in force in any case

120 tanks and about 6000 combat troops to saudi arabia defense 
secretary tom king said today 
the move marks the first deployment of tanks and significant 
numbers of ground troops by any western country apart from the 
united states since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the armored brigade will more double the british military 
personnel in the persian gulf and king stressed that force remains 
an option for ending the iraqi occupation of kuwait 
the defense secretary also announced that britain would be 
sending another squadron of tornado ground attack aircraft and some 
additional air defense aircraft 
our purpose in sending further forces is twofold first to 
ensure that no further aggression can possibly succeed and that the 
defensive shield is sure for saudi arabia and the threatened gulf 
states he said 
the defense secretary said that while we seek the 
implementation of the united nations resolutions by peaceful means 
other options remain available and that one way or another he 
will lose 
iraqs evil aggression must be reversed and my announcement 
today confirms our determination to play our full part in the 
worldwide effort to achieve this king said 
the 7th armored brigade based in west germany includes two 
armored regiments with 120 challenger tanks armored infantry 
battalion with warrior armored fighting vehicles squadron of 
scimitar combat vehicles artillery regiment and air defense 
battery with javelin missiles king said

royal irish hussars staffordshire regiment 40 field regiment 
royal artillery and squadron of queens dragoon guards

final decision on the british response to us urgings to nato 
countries to send ground troops 
in addition to the chieftain tanks each with a crew of four and 
weighing nearly 150000 pounds the brigade is likely to include 
several light reconnaissance scorpion tanks and dozsens of 
mechanized combat vehicles

chain separate from the american m1a1 abrams tanks in saudi arabia 
as part of americas desert shield operation the shells and spares 
for the abrams and the challenger are different 
britain now has three squadrons of warplanes 12 naval vessels 
and ground support units involving some 3000 military personnel in 
the gulf 
the government gave no immediate indication of the cost of 
transporting and maintaining the brigade in gulf region it says 
the current air and naval forces cost 141 million to deploy and 
are costing nearly 2 million a day to keep there

a worker accidentally inserted a 2foot 
metal rod upsidedown in a measuring instrument while making the 
hubble space telescopes primary mirror causing a flaw that 
blurred the 15 billion scopes view nasa officials said 
this particular day he didnt notice that the rod went in 
upsidedown said charles pellerin director of astrophysics for 
nasa so he made an error and never knew it 
pellerin spoke thursday at a news conference at hughes danbury 
optical systems inc where a nasa investigative team had concluded 
two days of meetings the company manufactured the hubbles primary 
mirror in the late 1970s and early 1980s when hughes danbury was a 
division of perkinelmer corp 
there was no way the person who inserted the rod could have 
known it was upsidedown said lew allen director of nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory who led the investigative team allen 
declined to idenify the person 
it was a technical error made by people of good will who made 
a mistake he said the rod made of the temperatureinsensitive 
metal invar was used in a measuring device that guided the 
polishing of the mirror allen said 
because it was inserted incorrectly it caused a 13 millimeter 
spacing error that led to the mirror being manufactured with a 
flaw he said 
the flaw called a spherical aberration has blurred the view of 
the muchacclaimed hubble the orbiting observatory was supposed to 
take razorsharp pictures of the outer reaches of space 
the flaw will be corrected during a previously scheduled 1993 
space shuttle mission to replace the hubbles most powerful 
instrument the widefield planetary camera said pellerin 
it will cost an extra 15 million to build the new planetary 
camera to make up for the flaw pellerin said the national 
aeronautics and space administration originally estimated the new 
camera would cost up to 65 million he said 
many tests could have been done to detect the error during the 
manufacturing process but perkinelmer scientists and engineers 
didnt do them because were under tremendous pressure to finish the 
project allen said 
the pressures including cost overruns and time constraints 
distracted those working on the mirror he said also some tests 
that had detected the error were considered unreliable at the time 
he said 
with 2020 hindsight one would clearly say there was 
negligence allen said but you have to take into account 
the situation that actually existed 
this was the investigative teams third and final visit to 
hughes danbury allen said the team will issue a final report on 
their findings as soon as possible he said

the body of a 10yearold boy was discovered in 
an abandoned grain silo after his frightened playmates who 
witnessed his accidental fall revealed the secret they had kept for 
months 
just last week a nationwide mailing campaign sent a photograph 
of the missing boy ricky rodriguez to millions of homes seeking 
clues to the boys disappearance april 26 
but thursday the mother of one of rickys playmates called 
police to say she learned what happened to ricky 
ricky fell from atop a towering abandoned grain silo at the 
deserted falstaff brewing corp on the citys southeast side while 
bouncing with the other boys on conveyer belts atop the silos 
police said 
fearing theyd be blamed for rickys death the boys friends 
kept the secret from rickys parents and their own families as 
police used helicopters and scuba divers to search for him 
they were scared theyre just little boys and they thought 
they were going to get into trouble police detective eileen 
guest said 
well everybody can stop looking rickys father steve 
said thursday i thought he was dead the night he disappeared it 
just didnt fit his pattern to vanish but i was hoping 
the mystery began to unravel when a sister of one of rickys 
playmates overheard a conversation in which the boys said ricky 
had fallen she told her mother who called police 
police interviewed each of rickys four playmates separately and 
were convinced that the boys death had been accidental

now they can bury their son 
rickys picture recently had been featured in a nationwide

the senate decided today to consider a bill 
that would require automakers to improve fuel economy dramtically 
critics said the measure would only force consumers to buy smaller 
cars 
the move opened the way for a likely vote on the measure 
probably early next week the bill would require new cars to 
achieve an average 40 milespergallon fuel economy by the end of 
the decade 
a similar measure has been introduced in the house but has yet 
to emerge from committee 
by a vote of 6828 the senate agreed to proceed with the 
legislation and scuttled an effort by sen donald riegle dmich 
to prevent the bill from being introduced 
the auto industry has vigorously opposed the legislation it 
claims the goal of a fleet fuel economy average of 40 mpg by the 
year 2001 a 40 percent increase is not achievable without forcing 
consumers to buy much smaller cars 
the vote was an indicator of the growing support in congress for 
the legislation as the middle east crisis and rising oil prices put 
renewed focus on the need for energy conservation 
supporters of the bill have argued that improving automobile 
fuel economy to an average of 40 mpg from todays 275 mpg would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day 
but in floor debate riegle said those fuel savings are not 
likely to begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to 
todays oil crisis would be to return to a national speed limit of 
55 miles an hour 
he reiterated many of the auto industrys arguments that the 
legislation would require the manufacture of much smaller cars 
increase traffic fatalities and reduce consumer choice 
sen richard bryan dnev the bills chief sponsor retorted 
that the idea was to send a message to the automakers that 
theyre going to have to look at fuel economy and not just muscle 
cars 
he said there is evidence that the higher fuel standards could 
be met without reducing car size significantly 
the auto industry and its unions have waged a vigorous lobbying 
campaign against the measure riegle last week displayed 40000 
telegrams from auto workers opposed to the legislation 
meanwhile environmentalists have maintained that improved auto 
fuel economy is the single best way to reduce americas dependence 
on foreign oil and also combat global warming through reduced 
emissions of carbon dioxide 
it does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we dont 
start conserving now some future president may have to consider 
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the middle 
east said bryan 
the bill would require automakers to boost the average mileage 
of new car fleets by 20 percent to about 35 mpg by 1995 and about 
40 percent to about 40 mpg by the year 2001

to forgive part of latin americas debt and aides said he would 
follow it by seeking authority for a freetrade pact with mexico 
with the persian gulf situation focusing attention on world oil

the end of the century

commitment to latin america 
bush has called for an eventual freetrade zone extending from 
the arctic circle to cape horn he said the legislation sent to 
capitol hill today was an important step toward that goal 
the legislation submitted today would forgive about 7 billion 
in loans owed to the government by latin american and caribbean 
countries 
latin nations owe us banks an additional 483 billion 
the bill also seeks to make it easier for us companies to 
invest in latin america he called the package trade not aid 
we believe these measure together will boost trade investment 
and growth in our hemisphere this legislation is good for our 
neighbors its good for the hemisphere and i believe it is very 
good for the united states bush said 
before the administration can begin freetrade talks with 
canada it needs legislation from congress authorizing it 
administration sources said the free trade measure could be sent 
to congress as early as next week

president fw de klerk said 
today the government may take additional steps to curb black 
township fighting that has claimed about 800 lives since august 
de klerk promised strong and comprehensive action but did 
not elaborate it was not immediately clear if the plan would 
include harsher police measures 
african national congress leader nelson mandela who met today 
with de klerk to discuss the unrest said he expects de klerk to 
announce the new policies monday 
mandela said de klerk no longer believes the township violence 
is solely a blackonblack conflict but that certain faceless 
elements are behind the attacks 
mandela would not specifically name who the anc believes is 
instigating the unrest but said we have our own suspicions 
some antiapartheid groups have alleged rogue elements of the 
security forces and white extremists are involved in the fighting 
witnesses in several townships say masked white men participated in 
recent attacks but there has been no proof of the claims 
de klerk said growing violence threatens talks on powersharing 
between whites and blacks 
there are forces which do not wish peaceful negotiations to 
succeed all those forces desiring peace must stand together to 
identify and counter these forces de klerk said 
the new south africa which is the goal of all sincere south 
africans is being threatened by present events he said 
police today said five blacks were killed and three others 
injured in soweto township in two separate attacks on minibuses 
used by commuters police said they were unsure whether the 
violence was linked to the factional fighting or part of a dispute 
among rival taxi drivers 
the main combatants in the fighting are zulus loyal to the 
conservative inkatha movement and xhosas and other blacks 
supporting the leftist anc 
also in soweto demonstrators burned a delivery truck belonging 
the the star the countrys largest circulation daily newspaper 
witnesses said the attackers were apparently upset by recent 
coverage of the fighting 
meanwhile the south african chamber of business said many 
blacks have been staying away from their jobs during the recent 
unrest 
among the topics discussed by de klerk and mandela in pretoria 
was a thursday night rampage by youths with guns and machetes on a 
black commuter train that left 26 dead and more than 100 injured 
police commanders said they did not know who the attackers were 
but two police officers at the scene said the youths were zulus a 
conductor said he heard the youths speaking in zulu 
about 10 black youths most in their late teens boarded the 
train in johannesburg and began attacking passengers when it 
started for soweto 
another gang of men were waiting for the train when it pulled 
into the next station and began shooting and stabbing the screaming 
passengers as they tried to flee the youths on the train 
passengers jumped from the train or tried to hide under seats as 
the youths stabbed and hacked people the dead included old women 
and men who were unable to run from the attackers 
they worked their way down the coaches very systematically 
killing people they were well organized and spoke to each other as 
they attacked people said one man at the station where the train 
was halted 
hundreds of heavily armed police and army troops in battle gear 
cordoned off the area army patrols with assault rifles walked 
along railway tracks hunting for bodies that passengers said were 
hurled from the train 
the township fighting spread from the eastern province of natal 
where the ancinkatha feud has killed about 5000 blacks since 
1986

the board of directors of the associated press 
has approved a general assessment increase of 39 percent for its 
1538 daily and weekly newspaper members and 5800 broadcast 
members effective jan 20 1991 
william j keating chairman of the ap board of directors and 
chairman and publisher of the cincinnati enquirer said that the 
assessment increase in percentage terms was the lowest in three 
years 
mindful of the difficult times that confront much of the 
industry at this stage the board approved a rate increase that is 
well below the projected inflation rate for 1990 and 1991 
keating said 
the 39 percent increase will not cover all of the increases and 
new costs faced by ap ap will continue to meet the growing demands 
of the news industry through a vigorous cost control effort and by 
increasing nontraditional revenue sources keating said 
nontraditional sources now make up 24 percent of aps revenue 
eleven years ago that figure was 7 percent 
of the new money that ap needs to fund 1991 operations and 
continue to improve services only 31 cents of every dollar will 
come from the assessment increase keating said 
it is vital to all of us that our cooperative remain strong 
and able to meet the challenges in news coverage and technology 
keating said even as some members reduce their own activity to 
absorb the impact of a difficult year in the industry demands on 
the ap grow as we look to ap to do things that in a healthier 
time we might not have relied on ap to do 
the general assessment increase will be combined with another 
step in the phasein of the circulationbased newspaper formula for 
those members that have not reached their appropriate assessment 
level the 1991 assessment will also reflect any circulation 
changes at the member newspaper 
the assessment increase applies to all basic services for both 
newspapers and broadcasters and to all supplemental services except 
for the rates for financial market tables which are being adjusted 
downward in two steps in 1990 and 1991 to reflect savings achieved 
in producing computergenerated stock lists 
ap members will receive their new weekly assessment figures by 
early october keating said

ousted dallas police chief mack vines entered an 
innocent plea to a perjury charge today telling reporters he was 
taken aback by his abrupt firing after his indictment this week 
i felt that we were going along well and mending bridges and 
building new bridges vines said before his arraignment in dallas 
county criminal court today 
the fact is im not guilty vines said 
vines who was fired two hours after he was indicted wednesday 
was released on his own recognizance and faces a pretrial hearing 
sept 28 state district court judge joe kendall said he would 
probably move the trial out of dallas 
frankly chief i dont believe that you can get a fair trial 
in this town kendall said adding that he doesnt usually move a 
trial on his own but felt obligated to because of extensive 
publicity over the case 
the misdemeanor charge alleges that vines lied to a panel 
investigating the firing of a police officer about a conversation 
he had with his assistant greg holliday on aug 2 
the grand jury rejected the district attorneys recommendation 
that vines be indicted on seven felony perjury counts for other 
statements made to the same panel the police officer was fired 
after he shot an unarmed mexican national the dismissal was later 
ruled unjustified 
holliday said vines called him late at night and tried to 
influence hollidays testimony before the special panel which he 
was scheduled to give the next day holliday told city manager jan 
hart of the conversation and she suspended both men with pay 
holliday later was reinstated

a federal appeals court today upheld most 
provisions of a gun control law that had been challenged by the 
national rifle association but struck down two recordkeeping 
rules 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld regulations 
requiring that licensed gun dealers sell guns only from shops or a 
sponsored gun show it also upheld a rule that gun dealers keep 
records on the sale of firearms from their personal collections as 
well as from their businesses 
the nra had challenged the regulations which were issued by the 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms to implement the firearms 
owners protection act of 1986 six other gun associations a gun 
show promoter and a gunsmith joined the lawsuit filed in us 
district court in charleston sc 
in august 1989 the district court judge solomon blatt jr 
upheld all but one provision of the act the nra filed an appeal to 
overturn the remainder 
the threejudge appeals panel agreed with the gun interests that 
the regulations went too far in requiring gun owners to record 
dealers license numbers during a sale 
the court also struck down a regulation requiring gun collectors 
to keep records of curios and relics in their possession before 
they get a collectors license

the food and drug administration is urging 
that people cook their eggs well to prevent the spread of 
potentially fatal food contamination caused by salmonella bacteria 
cooks who use raw eggs for caesar salads bearnaise sauce 
eggnog and ice cream risk serious food poisoning the fda said 
the agency in 3500 notices sent to state and local food 
regulatory agencies recommended that intactshell eggs be 
redesignated as a potentially hazardous food because of 
increases in illnesses linked to consumption of egg products 
fda spokesman chris lecos said today the designation doesnt 
imply that a food is inherently unhealthful only that 
precautions are needed in storing and cooking it 
the notice advises that eggs be refrigerated at temperatures of 
45 degreesfahrenheit or less and thoroughly cooked at 140 degrees 
fahrenheit 
it says whole eggs should be cooked until the white is 
completely coagulated and firm and the yolk begins to thicken 
scrambled eggs need to be cooked until firm throughout 
restaurants and food service operations are told not to use raw 
eggs in uncooked readytoeat menu items and cooks are urged to 
substitute pasteurized eggs and egg products for shell eggs in 
recipes for salads sauces mayonnaise and ice cream calling for 
raw eggs 
department of agriculture figures show there were 6604 
illnesses and 43 deaths attributed to salmonella enteritidis 
bacteria between january 1985 and october last year eggs were 
implicated in 73 percent of 189 recorded outbreaks 
usda spokeswoman margaret webb said 56 salmonella outbreaks have 
been confirmed since february this year with 22 definitely linked 
to eggs she said eggs may also be implicated in other cases which 
have centered in the northeast and midatlantic states 
pennsylvania has reported nine outbreaks of the illness which 
can cause vomiting diarrhea and stomach cramps and can be fatal to 
the elderly and young children 
ms webb said the usda is trying to pinpoint infection in 
breeder flocks the chickens producing commercial hens she said 
one flock in maryland one in alabama and four in pennsylvania had 
been restricted during the current campaign 
last may the fda approved irradiation of poultry to control 
salmonella but the industry said it had no plans to use the 
procedure 
cathy mccharen vice president of the egg nutrition center in 
washington said the egg industry generally supports the 
recommendations 
if eggs were properly refrigerated there would be no 
salmonella at all she said the recommendations will force 
food handlers and restaurateurs to treat the egg with the kind of 
respect it deserves that we do want to see

facing allegations it has been too tightfisted 
during the persian gulf tensions japan on friday pledged an 
additional 3 billion for the usled military mobilization in the 
region 
the commitment includes 600 million in immediate emergency 
loans to egypt jordan and turkey to ease economic problems 
stemming from the trade embargo against iraq chief cabinet 
secretary misoji sakamoto announced 
japan will later decide how to disburse another 14 billion in 
aid to arab nations and earmark up to 1 billion more for the gulf 
forces he added 
last month the cabinet announced 1 billion for the troops 
massed in saudi arabia following iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
japan also had pledged 22 million to help refugees in the gulf 
region 
japan which receives most of its oil from the middle east has 
been rebuked by some us officials who believed the nation should 
contribute more to pay for the forces japans postwar constitution 
prohibits the country from sending troops outside its borders 
on wednesday us congressmen passed a resolution demanding 
japan pay all expenses of american troops based in japan the 
proposals sponsor rep david bonior dmich said he thought 
japans support for the multinational effort in the gulf was 
inadequate 
if they had known the magnitude of the total package of 
contribution measures which we have announced today they would 
know how serious japan is in trying to cooperate with the united 
states and other countries in keeping the peace and security in 
that region even at the sacrifice of our own finances said 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe 
watanabe also announced the first contingent of a 100member 
medical team is scheduled to be dispatched to the gulf tuesday the 
17 officials doctors and nurses in the first unit will look into 
conditions and report back to japan he said 
sakamoto said president bush expressed appreciation for japans 
active role in the international effort in the gulf 
he said the loans to egypt jordan and turkey could carry 1 
percent annual interest and be repayable in 30 years 
us rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the 
house armed services committee hailed the action by japan but said 
she will watch japan to ensure the contribution is as good as it 
sounds 
ms schroeder complained that it took congressional action to 
get japan to to provide a realistic contribution to the middle 
east effort 
the house resolution passed 37053 stated the united states 
would withdraw 5000 troops each year from japan until tokyo agrees 
to pay the full cost of all 50000 troops now stationed in the 
nation the united states spends about 45 billion annually for 
the us forces in japan while japan contributes about 29 
billion 
watanabe denied the resolution prompted the decision to expand 
gulf aid japanese press reports for several days had predicted the 
increase 
meanwhile japan has been considering legislation to allow 
sending nonmilitary personnel to help un peacekeeping 
activities final approval could take months

about 100 people were evacuated from 50 
threatened homes today as a wildfire burned out of control across 
2500 acres in tuolumne county officials said 
the fire forced authorities to evacuate residents in the rural 
mount provo area three miles southeast of twain harte said pat 
kaunert a spokesman for the california department of forestry 
this fire is potentially a real dangerous one for us 
kaunert said the fire is burning more intensely than it should 
because it is so dry 
the drought has left the vegetation just crackling dry he 
said 
more than 1300 firefighters are battling the fire their task 
made all the more difficult by the steep and difficult terrain in 
the canyon the blaze was 40 percent contained this morning 
the firefighters are up against the very worst in this fire 
kaunert said adding that the area is so dry that the fire is 
spreading rapidly even without winds 
us forest service spokeswoman mary hale said the fire 
apparently started in a campground on the north fork of the 
tuolumne river within the stanislaus national forest west of 
yosemite national park the area is about 150 miles east of san 
francisco 
since there was no lightning in the area it is presumed the 
fire was caused by people the forestry department said 
officials said they are using over 100 engines seven air 
tankers three light helicopters and 10 bulldozers to battle the 
fire

retail sales dropped 06 percent in august 
the government said friday analysts said the governments first 
report on americans spending since the persian gulf crisis 
indicated growing consumer caution but not panic 
economists agreed the report was worrisome evidence of 
continuing economic weakness but said it appeared to be worse than 
it really was because of the impact of the oil shock on the service 
station sales and the way automobile sales are counted 
if you take out gas and autos it was down 01 percent said 
david berson chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association 
the commerce department said overall sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1492 billion down from 1500 billion in july and the 
largest decline since sales fell 10 percent in april 
auto sales fell 43 percent their steepest drop since sinking 
56 percent in january but economists said that reflected a 
seasonal adjustment and that actual sales were virtually unchanged 
from both june and july 
excluding automobile sales retail sales rose 04 percent in 
august 
on the other hand sales at gasoline stations jumped 64 
percent the largest increase since a 83 percent gain in august 
1979 
but analysts said the sharp hike reflected sharply higher prices 
rather than increased volume the american petroleum institute said 
gasoline prices have risen 20 percent since the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
nevertheless sales would have fallen 11 percent without the 
service station category 
the simple reality is that consumers are gradually pulling 
back in their spending out of concern over a weakening job market 
and unstable conditions in the middle east said david jones an 
economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new york government 
securities dealer 
theres no indication that will stop in the coming months 
jones added i think the economy is slowly sinking into a 
recession 
robert g dederick chief economist with the northern trust co 
in chicago contended that consumers are not showing signs of 
panicking although they are talking one thing and doing 
another 
analysts are worried about the impact of middle east 
developments on americans spending two major surveys one 
conducted by the conference board in new york and another by the 
university of michigan showed that consumer confidence plummeted 
after the iraq invasion 
because consumer spending represents twothirds of the nations 
economic activity there was concern that a dropoff could help push 
the nation into a recession retail sales account for about half of 
all consumer spending 
sales of durable goods bigticket items expected to last more 
than three years slid 26 percent after rising 07 percent in the 
preceding month 
besides automobiles the building material component also fell 
down 24 percent sales of furniture and other home furnishings 
rose 07 percent 
nondurable goods sales rose 06 percent following julys 03 
percent gain 
except for gasoline all nondurable categories fell 
sales at department stores were down 02 percent grocery 
stores off 02 percent clothing stores down 09 percent 
restaurants and bars off 07 percent and drug stores down 05 
percent

some iraqi soldiers defecting from 
occupied kuwait are being sent back home with food and water and 
being told to convey a message that things are pretty good over 
here the us commander in saudi arabia says 
gen h norman schwarzkopf said he had verified from americans 
who were there some reports of defectors wandering across the 
border and being taken into custody by saudi arabian troops there 
were also reports of iraqis found dead in the desert in kuwait 
after they ran out of water 
saudi officers have told of hundreds of iraqis defecting from 
the forces in kuwait sometimes arriving in armored personnel 
carriers or other vehicles 
but the saudis have not provided any overall number of defectors 
and have refused reporters requests to see the turncoats or 
equipment 
in an interview at his headquarters here schwarzkopf said he 
had no solid numbers but was sure some had abandoned their posts in 
kuwait 
they wander in in twos and threes looking for water and saying 
they dont want to fight he said 
its my understanding that the saudis who have been handling 
this problem say we agree you shouldnt be fighting heres some 
food heres some water go back and tell your folks that things 
are pretty good over here 
saudi military officials were not immediately available to 
comment on the report of the returned defectors 
its not huge figures yet schwarzkopf said of the 
defections but i fully hope that the forces that are in kuwait 
fully understand that saddam hussein has put them there to die 
some defectors including those carrying useful military 
intelligence remain in saudi arabia he said none has been shown 
to reporters 
schwarzkopf said information from the iraqi forces indicated 
saddams soldiers didnt know the aug 2 move into kuwait was to 
take over the country by force theyre still quite shocked by 
the fact that the kuwaitis fought them he said 
many thought they were going on maneuvers in kuwait that the 
kuwaiti government had asked them to protect it or that they were 
going to fight israelis he said 
the fourstar general said he could not assess the overall 
morale of the iraqis 
a lot of that depends on theirleadership what kind of 
resupply they have and we just dont have that lever of detailed 
intelligence he said 
diplomats and western military analysts in baghdad several days 
ago reported morale problems among iraqi troops in kuwait because 
the army could not supply them with enough water and good food 
they have also said some iraqi officers were executed for 
opposing the invasion unconfirmed reports from iraqi dissidents 
said as many as 120 officers had been shot by firing squad and 
others imprisoned

a republican deficitreduction plan being 
considered by budget negotiators would raise taxes for people 
making less than 50000 a year but cut them for richer americans 
congressional analysts say 
the proposal would mean 41 billion a year in new taxes for 
people with annual incomes under 50000 those at or above 50000 
would get an 11 billion tax reduction 
disclosure of the analysis of the proposal which includes 
limits on deductions for state and local income taxes increased 
levies on alcoholic beverages and a cut in the capital gains tax 
drew angry criticism today from gop negotiators 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas questioned whether 
there is any reason to go on with negotiations when some democrats 
continue to fax and leak and fax stuff to reporters all day long 
with their point of view 
dole said the morning news was filled with reports that 
republicans are out there trying to favor the rich 
thats the same old democratic lie thats been out here for 
20 30 40 years dole said 
sen phil gramm rtexas called the leaks part of a 
systematic strategy to take the tough components of any package 
and blame republicans for those components 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine also condemnned 
the leaking of information from the talks it is unfortunate it 
has occurred on both sides it ought to stop he told the senate 
as negotiators headed toward nearby andrews air force base md 
for another session sen pete domenici rnm told reporters 
were nowhere 
its going to be a long process said sen james sasser 
dtenn chairman of the senate budget committee 
negotiators are racing to beat an oct 1 deadline unless a 
deficitcutting plan is approved by then about 100 billion of 
acrosstheboard reductions in federal programs will be triggered 
two weeks later 
analysts for the nonpartisan staff of the joint committee on 
taxation said the republican proposal would produce an average 55 
percent tax cut for the 740000 couples and individuals with annual 
incomes of 200000 and more the 33 million people with incomes 
under 10000 would pay an average 26 percent more 
the plan is tilted in favor of those with higher incomes 
primarily because of the cut in taxes on capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of investments analysts say nearly 80 
percent of the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax would go 
to those with incomes over 100000 a year 
president bush insists on including a capital gains cut in any 
deficitreduction plan saying it is needed for economic growth 
democratic leaders say they will not allow the cut unless overall 
income tax rates on the wealthy are raised to make up for the 
capital gains reduction 
tax provisions offered by democratic negotiators include a 20 
percent surtax on those with annual incomes above 500000 
elimination of the 51300 limit on the amount of wages subject to 
the 145 percent medicare tax higher taxes on alcohol an 
11centagallon boost in gasoline taxes and a 4 percent tax on 
other forms of energy 
congressional analysts said the democratic plan would result in 
a 4 billion tax cut for those making less than 20000 a year and 
an increase of 265 billion for others a family making about 
45000 would pay 32 percent more a 250000 family would pay 67 
percent more 
despite months of talking the white house and congressional 
leaders have reached final agreement on no specific tax increase or 
spending reduction they have agreed generally on the need for 
reducing the deficit by 50 billion in fiscal 1991 and an 
additional 450 billion in the following four years 
the lack of agreement among the deficit negotiators prompted the 
house on thursday to delay consideration of the 283 billion 
defense bill until next week the delay was intended to give our 
negotiators a little opportunity said house speaker thomas 
foley dwash 
while the negotiations drone on the administration is preparing

a constitutional committee overturned a decree 
issued by president mikhail s gorbachev that gave the soviet 
government power over rallies in central moscow tass reported 
friday 
the constitutional compliance committee ruled that gorbachevs 
decree was unconstitutional because it narrowed the powers of 
the russian republic of which moscow is capital and the moscow 
city council tass said 
gorbachevs decree had empowered the soviet government to decide 
whether rallies could be held within the garden ring road a wide 
boulevard that circles central moscow previously soviet 
legislation gave final say over rallies to parliaments in the 
republics and local governing councils tass said 
tass did not say when the constitutional committee made its 
decision 
gorbachevs decree was issued in april after newly elected 
democratic reformers took control of the moscow city council in 
february the national parliament had asked the government to 
oversee rallies in moscow fearing that extremists and criminal 
elements would exploit the demonstrations to destabilize society 
there have been several big rallies in moscow this year drawing 
thousands of people shouting for the downfall of communism

president bush sent congress a bill friday to 
forgive some latin american debt and to encourage more us 
companies to invest there aides said he also was readying a bill 
to allow the lowering of trade barriers with mexico 
the mexican freetrade measure could be submitted as early as 
monday wen administration trade officials testify before the 
housesenate joint economic committee sources said 
bush would like to have the authority to lower trade barriers 
with mexico in hand when he meets with president carlos salinas de 
gortari in mexico city in november said officials who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
the persian gulf crisis in focusing attention on world oil 
supplies has added to the impetus for such an agreement with 
mexico the officials said 
mexico has the worlds eighth largest oil reserves a freetrade 
pact with the united states could spur oil production 
the united states already has a freetrade pact with canada and 
bush has voiced the hope that some day goods and services may be 
traded from alaska to argentina without trade barriers 
he repeated that goal friday at a white house ceremony as he 
announced he was sending congress a proposed enterprise for the 
americas initiative act of 1990 bush called the package trade 
not aid 
the legislation submitted would forgive about 7 billion in 
loans owed to the government by latin american and caribbean 
countries latin nations owe us banks an additional 483 
billion 
the bill also would set up a special fund within the 
interamerican development bank to provide a variety of services to 
western companies wanting to invest in latin america and the 
caribbean 
the us government would contribute 500 million a year to the 
fund and would seek contributions from other countries 
we believe these measures together will boost trade 
investment and growth in our hemisphere this legislation is good 
for our neighbors its good for the hemisphere and i believe it is 
very good for the united states bush said 
under the freetrade pact with canada tariffs quotas and other 
trade barriers began to fall in january 1989 and will be removed by 
the turn of the century 
mexico is the united states third largest trading partner 
after canada and japan the united states exported 2497 billion 
in goods to mexico last year and received 2719 in imports for a

here is the text of president bushs news 
conference friday on the white house lawn 
president bush well i just want to say a couple of things here 
and id be glad to take just a handful of questions 
first i want to publicly acknowledge and express my 
appreciation for the decision by the japanese government to make 
additional contributions to the effort that were all making in the 
gulf 
specifically japan will be providing significant economic 
assistance to key countries in the region that are most severely 
affected by the sanctions and higher energy prices japan is also 
increasing its support for the multinational forces involved in the 
collective defense effort 
and i gave my personal thanks to prime minister kaifu last night 
when he called me to tell me about this news and we are grateful 
to the japanese significant contribution 
and second and in a similar vein i want to say that early this 
morning prime minister thatcher phoned to give me the additional 
good news of her countrys latest contribution 
she informed me that the united kingdom would be sending a full 
armored brigade along with the additional helicopters and 
aircraft to saudi arabia some americans may remember the name the 
desert rats and thats whos thats who will be going 
as i told the prime minister over the phone given all that the 
united kingdom is already doing this truly comes as the icing on 
the cake a significant move by the brits 
and i also called president mitterrand a few minutes ago to 
consult with him on the outrageous iraqi breakin of the french 
embassy residence in kuwait 
these developments not only underscore the brutal behavior of 
iraq but also the international support that exists and is 
marshaled against iraqs occupation of kuwait 
ive often said that it is not the united states against iraq 
but iraq against the world and for our part we will continue to 
do everything possible to ensure that the sanctions work as 
intended and to deter and if need be defend saudi arabia against 
armed attack

and here i just want to reiterate what i said when i first 
ordered the us forces to saudi arabia namely that the united 
states forces were sent to saudi arabia at the request of the saudi 
government and those same us forces will depart as soon as they 
are no longer needed or wanted and they will remain not one day 
longer than is absolutely necessary john 
q mr president are we any closer to armed combat because of 
what has happened at the french embassy and also because a us 
warship apparently has now fired across the bow of an iraqi tanker 
what do you know about that 
a i wouldnt put it closer to a war situation i still hope 
that this matter can be peacefully resolved and the way for that 
to happen is for iraq to comply with the sanctions 
yes an american vessel did in accordance with the united 
nations resolutions in accordance with the sanctions cause 
another iraqi vessel to heave to and it has been boarded and i 
expect confidently that if it indeed is not carrying any 
contraband or anything that will violate the sanctions it will be 
permitted to go on its way 
but it did require a bit of a warning before the captain pulled 
over and permitted the boarding party to have a look yeah rita 
q mr president what can you tell us about the us consul 
that was detained in the canadian ambassadors house any protest r 
any action about that 
a i dont have all the details about that one but again i 
would lump that into the to the the unacceptable action 
category i dont have the facts on that id have aside do you 
 
staff theyve been released mr president 
a they have been released so but any of these incidents all 
of them add up to clear violations of international law and i 
think they do raise tensions they clearly do yeah 
q mr president how is ambassador howell and would the us 
have to respond militarily if iraq entered the united states 
compound in kuwait city 
a thats too hypothetical the last part of the question but i 
have no reason to believe that ambassador howell that howell is 
not in good shape i havent heard anything to the contrary 
q how long are you going to keep him there sir 
a i have not made a determination on that 
q can you tell us 
q mr president gasoline prices are up dramatically and 
heating oil is at a record level in todays wholesale price report 
does that send what kind of warning signals does that send to you 
about the overall economic situation related to the gulf crisis

asked if todays events put the united states any closer to a 
war with iraq bush said

happen is for iraq to comply with the sanctions

delivered to iraqi officials in baghdad after getting off to a 
slow start on thursday when the iraqi ambassador in washington 
refused to accept a copy 
the sudden inflation represented by the 13 percent rise in 
august wholesale prices reported today by the labor department was 
a matter of concern given the state of the economy still he 
said there are sufficient petroleum supplies and the market 
should not be going for higher prices 
the budget negotiations between the white house and congress 
under way for a week at nearby andrews air force base were up 
and down like a roller coaster he said that administration 
negotiators this morning felt they were closing the gap

his supreme court nominee david souter and my admiration for

a well i think anytime you have price inflation sudden 
inflation it is a matter of concern given the state of the 
economy what it does is make me argue even more vociferously for a 
budget agreement 
but there are the shortages this speculation here were 
talking about future market prices were talking about futures 
they that speculative atmosphere belies the reality which is 
that there are sufficient petroleum products to so that the 
market should not be going for higher prices in other words its 
speculation its futures speculation yeah 
q mr president whats your reading on the budget agreement 
a talking about i believe youre talking about october prices 
that are quoted on the crude market yeah 
q whats your reading on the budget negotiations as the clock 
ticks out 
a well kind of up and down like a roller coaster this morning 
there was a feeling our dick darman and john sununu secretary 
brady felt that they were closing the gap last night it was a 
little more pessimistic 
so i cant tell you i havent talked to our negotiators in the 
last two hours 
q is france going to take action as a result of the embassy 
incursion will the united states take action as a result of that 
a i dont know what france is going to do but clearly i will 
continue close consultation with mr mitterrand because i told him 
i view this as a matter that is of grave concern to to the united 
states 
it happens to be the french ambassadors residence but it is a 
matter that we look at as that concerns everybody and i told him 
that i would do anything i could to support whatever he decides to 
do and he will be back i found him in czechoslovakia and he 
will be back and i believe he has a cabinet meeting tomorrow so 
well simply wait and see what they recommend 
q does that include backing them militarily 
q mr president 
a yeah charles 
q inaudible suggesting that the iraqis are in fact 
tightening the screws in a number of areas inaudible 
escalation now required from you and your allies 
a well when an escalation is required from me saddam hussein 
will know it 
q what about the tape 
q does that 
a oh the tape havent heard i think its there now aside 
do we know whether the tape has arrived 
marlin fitzwater it should be there tonight 
a it got off to a slow start with that eagleburger handoff 
but it should be there tonight laughter 
q mr president for two days 
a chuckling its one of the classic scenes 
q have you had a chance to see any of judge souters testimony 
and do you have any kind of opinion for how its going 
a ive seen it and i think its been magnificent i havent 
seen it all but i must confess slight confession and maybe 
its because our budgeteers were out at the summit doing all the 
heavy lifting i watched it for about an hour and a half yesterday 
and i watched it for about 20 minutes today and my admiration for 
judge souter and respect for him is even higher i really think

the fbi joined the search for a missing 
insurance executive under indictment for theft after two people 
reported seeing him in the virgin islands and another sighted him 
on a yacht in south carolina 
the state attorney generals office has been looking for blan 
stewart 47 since halloween night 1988 when his airplane 
disappeared near lake martin in central alabama 
stewart who lived in huntsville had radioed that he was having 
engine trouble repeated searches of the lake by law enforcement 
officers and by firms hired by stewarts family and insurance 
companies never turned up the plane or a body 
on tuesday the fbi issued a fugitive warrant for stewart and 
joined the search agent tom wiseman said in an affidavit used to 
obtain the warrant the fbi quoted two unidentified sources 
including one huntsville resident who said they saw stewart in the 
virgin islands in late november or early december 1989 
the fbi said telephone records subpoenaed by the state attorney 
generals office showed a collect call from the virgin islands to 
stewarts wifes home in huntsville in march the call came six 
weeks before sarah robin stewart went to court to have her 
husband declared dead so she could collect on 4 million in life 
insurance a judge ruled however there was insufficient evidence 
to declare stewart dead 
the fbis affidavit said a third source who lives in huntsville 
and knows stewart and his family well saw him on a yacht in 
charleston sc in early april and spoke to him by name 
mrs stewarts attorney john heacock said weve never been 
critical of law enforcement agencies doing their job but we 
have no knowledge of any such sources 
don valeska an assistant alabama attorney general who has 
helped lead the search has said he considered the sources 
reliable 
he said friday there had been no new sightings and no new tips 
in the case since the warrant was issued 
at the time of stewarts disappearance he was awaiting trial on 
charges of insurance theft involving 590000 he collected but 
allegedly failed to pass on to insurance companies writing the 
policies in addition he faces firstdegree theft charges in 
lauderdale county where he is accused of passing a worthless check 
for nearly 12000 to a furniture plant 
insurance companies have posted a 100000 reward for 
information on whether he is alive or dead

which along with the neighboring baltic republics of lithuania and 
estonia is seeking independence from the soviet union 
a resolution endorsed thursday by the presidium or cabinet of 
the latvian parliament protested the training of soldiers from 
the armed forces of the aggressorstate iraq and demanded the 
soviet navy and the baltic military district immediately inform 
the supreme council of the republic of latvia about all foreign 
military personnel and their family members who are stationed in 
the territory 
andrejs krastins a vicechairman of the latvian parliament 
said the iraqis were studying rockets and missiles he said latvian 
authorities should cut off water electricity and food to the base 
if the they didnt leave 
komsomolskaya pravda said the report did not come as a surprise 
to residents of riga who are accustomed to seeing military 
specialists from the middle east in the cafes and restaurants of 
the baltic port 
the soviet union has trained thousands of soldiers from 
socialist states and other nations to which it has sold military 
weapons the publicity over the iraqi trainees was the latest 
embarrassment for moscow involving military ties to its longtime 
ally 
the soviet union condemned iraq following its invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 and has cut off arms shipments to baghdad 
but about 190 soviet military advisers remain in iraq under 
contract to train saddam husseins soldiers to use and repair their 
military gear foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said tuesday 
the soviet union has not reneged on the contract for fear that 
doing so would jeopardize the 5800 soviet citizens still in iraq

q do you think the questioning has been fair 
a what ive seen so far yeah and theyre a senator has a 
right to ask any question he wants and what i think has been 
masterful is the way judge souter has gone as far as he possibly 
can and yet has handled it with such intellect and such a you 
know knowledgeable manner that i dont think anybody gets the 
feeling that he is improperly avoiding things yeah 
q sen dole this morning said he thinks the capital gains 
off mike 
a listen sen dole is doing a magnificent job out there i 
dont know in what context he placed that and i think everybody in 
the summit knows of my commitment to it 
im absolutely convinced that it would not even be a revenue 
loser although its scored that way and it is something that is 
fundamentally important to the continued growth in the economy a 
growth that frankly is far too slow right now so i hope its put 
into effect but im not going to kind of go beyond that 
q since last november off mike 
a because weve got a strategy and i think its working and i 
think all our people are on the same side on this issue 
fitzwater final question 
a here we are rita and then ive got to go 
q mr president i couldnt hear what charles asked but did 
you tell mitterrand that you would back him with military 
retaliation if thats the way he wants to go 
a we didnt go into the details of the backing but i just told 
him he has the full support of the united states and he does 
q have you talked to ambassador howell about what he should do 
if iraqi forces 
a i havent talked to howell in the last week last one john 
and then i really 
q is it different sir from an american the american 
embassy being invaded however this is youre 
a im not sure id make that distinction 
q well are you rattling at least one saber you talk about 
a no im not rattling sabers youre trying to get me to sound 
like im rattling sabers when i rattle a saber the man will know 
it 
q but you talked about grave concern but you also talked about 
the fact that youll pull the troops back as soon as you can we 
have we saw a mixed signal 
a oh no there should be no connection between those at all i 
mean what i was trying to do was theres been some speculation 
some of it mischievous in the middle east that the united states 
wants to remain there and so what i want to do is just reiterate 
what i think i said in the meeting to the joint session and that 
is that we want those people all of them out as soon as 
possible 
and so i that should be separated from anything im saying 
here im glad you asked let me clarify that 
q are the saudis getting anxious about having so many american 
troops there 
a i havent heard that at all and i dont think so i know i 
would have heard it if if that were the case they are totally 
clued in on what our plans are so theres no no disquiet on that 
at all 
thank you all 
q thank you 
q do you expect a budget agreement this weekend 
a we expected one a week ago

new jersey state government is reeling from 
what some are calling computergate the case of a republican 
computer hacker who allegedly pilfered confidential democratic 
files 
the files reportedly show the democrats used state time for 
campaign work 
it is a case that leaders of both parties declared closed in 
may when the legislatures joint ethical committee dropped its 
investigation and refused to release its findings 
but the issue wont go away 
last week assembly republican staff executive director john 
kohler quit his 95000ayear job after admitting he knew former 
staffer jeffrey land had broken into democratic computer files 
kohler had previously denied knowledge of the actions 
state leaders concede that land who resigned in march gathered 
more than 1000 democratic documents over 18 months land 
reportedly handed the purloined documents over to his superiors 
state attorney general robert del tufo has launched an 
investigation to determine if criminal charges will be filed 
but the legislative committees report leaked to the record of 
hackensack also raised questions about the actions of the 
democrats 
the pilfered documents show staff members of top democrats used 
state time and state computers to plot political campaign strategy 
the documents reportedly include lists of campaign contributors 
critics charge that the legislaturs decision to probe the case 
in private smacked of a coverup 
this is playing out with many of the same sordid aspects of 
the watergate scandal said edward mccool executive director of 
new jersey common cause a government watchdog group there is 
denial coverup secret meetings to decide what to do next and 
there is the question of how far up it went it seems the 
legislature thinks it is above accountability 
mccool said the computer breach was a breakin involving state 
equipment by one partisan staff of another partisan staff just 
because technology is involved makes it no less a violation its 
the same as if a door was jimmied or a window broken 
why didnt the democrats prosecute mccool said 
reasonably minded people can only speculate that it had to do 
with the nature of the information that was stolen 
legislative leaders deny a coverup they initially called the 
ethics panel probe an internal personnel matter and said it was 
protected by the doctrine of separation of powers between the 
branches of government 
leaders from both parties have subsequently said they would 
cooperate with the attorney generals investigation but albert 
porroni executive director of the nonpartisan office of 
legislative services told reporters that the legislature can 
withhold documents having to do with legislative activity on 
pending bills 
democratic assembly speaker joseph doria on monday said he was 
saddened by the revelations and that he is upset it would 
have to get to that level 
but doria also said he hadnt seen any of the stolen documents 
and said he doesnt have the time or inclination to look through 
1000 documents 
doria and other leaders refused further comment about what 
documents should be turned over to the attorney generals office 
assembly republican minority leader chuck haytaian who 
announced kohlers resignation said such conduct cannot under 
any circumstances be tolerated 
haytaian who became minority leader in january said in a 
statement i remain convinced that no legislator had any such 
involvement or knowledge 
on thursday the ethics committee reopened its investigation and 
announced it will call land and kohler to testify about their roles 
in the incident land told reporters earlier in the week that he 
will cooperate with the investigations he has since refused to 
comment publicly on the case kohler said thursday he planned to 
meet with the committee 
haytaian said he will call for clear guidelines to determine 
the responsibilities and obligations of partisan staff members 
however mccool said revamping the system cant be solved in 
the dark this can only be solved if there is a full and public 
hearing of what happened

supreme court nominee david souter said today 
that he has not made up his mind on the abortion rights issue and 
would consider both sides if he is confirmed 
faced with repeated probes for his predisposition in the case of 
roe vs wade souter broke from his pattern of not commenting and 
stated flatly that he didnt have a position 
i have not got any agenda on what should be done with roe vs 
wade souter told the senate judiciary committee 
i would listen to both sides of that case i have not made up 
my mind and i would not go on the court saying i must go one way or 
i must go the other way he said 
souters comments came during his second day of testimony 
during which he also said he was obligated as a state official to 
defend limits on the separation of church and state but he 
probably would have ruled for the opposite side had he been the 
judge 
when in the new hampshire attorney generals office souter 
defended former gov meldrim thomsons order that flags be lowered 
to half staff on good friday he also prosecuted two jehovahs 
witnesses for covering the state motto live free or die on 
their license tags 
souter told the senate judiciary committee today he was 
obligated to defend the state if arguments could be made and he 
maintained that he could in those cases 
but he acknowledged if i were sitting as a judge today i 
probably would have ruled the same way as the one who decided the 
flaglowering order was unconstitutional 
as for the license plate motto he said the state did not have 
a particularly compelling interest in keeping its slogan 
visible the couple did not cover the numbers on the plate 
but souter said it was important for him to pursue the cases he 
said part of the job of upholding the constitution was to bring 
forth arguments on issues 
president bush meanwhile touted souter twice today he said on 
the white house lawn that his nominees performance has been 
magnificent 
bush said he watched parts of the hearing thursday and today 
and my admiration for judge souter respect for him is even 
higher than before he said souter had handled the panels 
questions with such intellect and such a knowledgeable manner 
that no one could accuse him of evasion 
earlier the president told an international gathering of 
appellate judges at the white house that souters strong 
incisive has an independent devotion to the constitution that was 
demonstrated during 12 years of distinguished service on the trial 
court the us court of appeals and in particular on the supreme 
court of his state the new hampshire supreme court 
souter began his second day of testimony fielding questions 
about how far courts should go in delineating new rights and 
souter said judges needed to stick to those implied by the 
constitution 
a judge has got to guard constantly against substituting his 
values for the values he is sworn to uphold he told sen charles 
grassley riowa an antiabortion lawmaker who quizzed the nominee 
about how far some judges have expanded concepts of constitutional 
rights 
as he had the opening day souter preferred to speak in general 
terms and avoided talking about issues like abortion which he may 
have to rule on 
on thursday committee members said they were learning about 
david souter the man but far less than some had hoped about david 
souter the potential supreme court justice 
i was touched by his sincerity but i dont think i learned 
whats in his mind with reference to the issues that will be before 
the supreme court said sen howard metzenbaum dohio who 
sought unsuccessfully to extract souters views on the 1973 ruling 
that legalized abortion 
as the committees first day of hearings thursday on president 
bushs nominee the 50yearold bachelor took pains to describe 
himself as a caring and understanding man and erase his reputation 
as a scholarly hermit 
he described the many types of cases he has handled from 
volunteer work for indigents as a young lawyer fresh from harvard 
to his handling of morally vexing disputes as an appeals judge 
in response to senators questions souter shifted between legal 
jargon and personal tales the latter providing the most drama of 
the afternoon 
metzenbaum told the nominee of testimony he heard from people 
who experienced the butchery of illegal abortions before the 
supreme courts roe vs wade ruling 
metzenbaum then challenged souter to discuss his personal 
outlook on the matter and the nominee shot back with a story from 
nearly a quartercentury ago when he was a freshman adviser at 
harvard 
the girlfriend of one of his charges was pregnant and was 
planning a selfabortion souter said and he agreed to counsel and 
console her they spent two hours together in a small room in a 
dormitory during which he advised her to do otherwise he said 
souter who throughout the day referred to the abortion rights 
position as the other side didnt make clear whether his 
advice was to carry the pregnancy to term but he said the incident 
etched in his mind the consequences involved 
before his confirmation hearings souter was counseled at length 
on how to handle himself one goal was to make sure the committee 
didnt think he was another robert bork the staunchly conservative 
nominee of president reagan who was rejected by the senate three 
years ago 
souter sought to portray himself as less ideological in his 
approach to the law 
regarding the right to privacy he acknowledged that in some 
cases such as dealings between a husband and wife it could be 
considered a fundamental right even though it is never explicitly 
mentioned in the constitution 
however he diligently refused to endorse specific court rulings 
on the issue because the roe vs wade decision hinges on the 
concept 
souters testimony was expected to last at least through today 
and the hearings were scheduled to continue next week at the end 
of the hearings the committee will vote on the nomination and give 
its recommendation to the full senate for approval or rejection

lawyers for a man charged with raping a 
woman who says she has 21 personalities are being allowed to review 
some of her medical records to try to prove at least one 
personality consented to sex 
mark a peterson 29 of oshkosh is charged with seconddegree 
sexual assault for allegedly having sex with the 26yearold woman 
on june 11 
he maintains the woman consented and he was unaware she had a 
mental illness he is free on a 5000 signature bond 
judge robert hawley of winnebago county circuit court ruled 
thursday that the defense could review the womans medical records 
for the 12 months before the alleged rape 
the district attorney may be allowed to strike things from the 
records that he fears would invade the womans privacy pending a 
review in the judges chambers 
hawley denied a motion by petersons attorney edward 
salzsieder that a psychiatrist for the defense be allowed to 
examine all of the womans medical records and psychiatric 
examinations and that she be available for examination by the 
psychiatrist 
hawley said a psychiatrist for the defense could talk to the 
womans psychiatrist listen to courtroom testimony and examine 
records already available 
he added he would reconsider the motion but the defense 
psychiatrist would have to testify as to the need to examine the 
woman 
the judge also denied two motions by salzsieder for dismissal of 
the case one contended the statute peterson is charged under is 
too vague the other said evidence and testimony presented at the 
preliminary examination did not support the charge

a senate panel friday endorsed a pair of 
ussoviet treaties more than a decade after the pacts aimed at 
curbing nuclear weapons testing were drafted 
the senate foreign relations committee took the action on an 
180 vote sending the two treaties to the full senate for 
ratification 
the threshold test ban treaty of 1974 places a limit of 150 
kilotons on the size of weapons tests and provides detailed 
standards for the tests to ensure each side can accurately measure 
the others explosions 
the peaceful nuclear explosions treaty of 1976 drawn up 
primarily to seal off possible loopholes in the ttb treaty puts 
identical limits on nuclear blasts for peaceful purposes such as 
excavation or seismic exploration 
both treaties which languished for years because of misgivings 
over us ability to verify soviet compliance lag far behind 
current armscontrol reality which contemplates massive reductions 
in each sides nuclear arsenals 
new verification protocols agreed to june 1 by president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev during their washington 
summit have largely cleared away the misgivings 
in fact the protocols have in some ways become more important 
than the treaties because they set up a new process of intrusive 
onsite inspections by both sides procedures that may become a 
model for a sweeping strategic arms agreement

oscarwinning actress cher 
at this point he said thursday i have to really question 
whether for another four years i want to just continue being mayor

st paul minn ap george spanky mcfarland the former 
child star of our gang and little rascals says he deserves 
about 100000 from a bar that had used a logo depicting a chubby 
boy in a beanie 
federal judge james rosenbaum on thursday ordered the saloon 
now called checkers nightclub and formerly spankys saloon not to 
use the visage or name of spanky its not enough for 
mcfarland 
drawings of a roundfaced kid wearing the beanie came down from 
the front of the building and from interior walls patrons no 
longer can buy jackets tshirts and hats imprinted with the 
spankys saloon logo 
other businesses pay mcfarland 62 who lives in fort worth 
texas for the right to use his name and childhood face mcfarland 
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former 
coowner of the st paul bar 
hes after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and 
thats an exorbitant amount of money even if they did something 
wrong said dennis johnson a lawyer for the bars former owner 
michael kalis 
kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner walter 
engelhardt in 1982 
johnson and engelhardt who represented himself in court 
contend the bars name had little to do with its business and that 
the connection with mcfarland was unintentional 
if every kid with a beanie on his head is him this country is 
in trouble engelhardt said last year if there were actual 
pictures of him here i could understand but not when its just 
some fatfaced kid 
rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the 
merchandise and took mcfarlands other claims under advisement

a city directive ordering teachers to 
curtail the traditional practice of using classroom walls as a 
gallery for student drawings essays and decorations drew fire from 
parents 
i think its terrible said cindy lawlor who learned of the 
new policy through a note home from a frustrated teacher the 
elementary school decorations lent cheer to the classrooms and gave 
children a boost she said 
i have three little ones and i dont have enough room on the 
refrigerator she said 
mayor christopher johnson said the policy is just a matter of 
fire safety 
the practice of hanging decorations in certain areas of the 
school has become excessive he said johnson said some 
decorations were stretched over heating vents and others hung from 
the ceiling 
the new policy says that decorations may cover no more than 20 
percent of a wall teachers are being urged to find flameretardant 
materials for wall displays instead of the traditional 
construction paper 
unfortunately the teachers caught wind of what was going on 
at the end of last year and theyve kind of taken this thing and 
kind of blown it out of proportion johnson said 
granger elementary school principal phyllis lewis said teachers 
and city officials are trying to work out a compromise 
number 1 is the kids safety and thats number 1 on our minds 
too she said our problem is weve done so much decorating 
its like going cold turkey 
parents are coming in and saying where did it all go last 
year for the first day of school i had 520 teddy bears on the 
walls lewis said 
putting a limit on classroom wall decorations is an issue that 
surfaces from time to time said philip osullivan of the 
massachusetts fire marshals office 
the life safety code guidelines of the national fire protection 
association recommends that 80 percent of the walls be left clear 
weve had calls in the past about excessive use of artwork and 
formal decorations said osullivan its something you do have 
to monitor no question you just cant let it run rampant

supreme court nominee david h souter told 
senators friday he had not made up his mind about what stance he 
would take as a justice on possible reopening of the courts 1973 
abortionlegalizing ruling 
after months of refusing to even address the question which has 
dominated speculation about his views souter said in answer to 
questions during the second day of his judiciary committee 
confirmation hearings 
i have not got any agenda on what should be done with roe vs 
wade i would listen to both sides of that case i have not 
made up my mind and i would not go on the court saying i must go 
one way or i must go the other way 
abortion foes have high hopes that president bushs nominee to 
replace liberal justice william j brennan will provide the 
critical vote to overturn the decision abortionrights groups have 
expressed fears that that might indeed happen 
also on abortion souter told the committee he had voted to let 
such operations be performed at a hospital where he served on the 
board of trustees but he said his vote did not necessarily reflect 
his moral views on abortion 
on another topic souter told the senators that as a judge he 
might go against some of the stands he took as new hampshires 
attorney general in freedomofreligion cases 
but defended his prosecution of demonstrators who opposed the 
building of the seabrook nuclear reactor in new hampshire 
meanwhile president bush touted his nominee at a news 
conference and at a white house meeting with an international 
gathering of judges 
bush said he had watched portions of the hearings on television 
and he called his nominees effort magnificent masterful 
souter was asked by sen gordon humphrey rnh about his vote 
to allow abortions while on the concord hospitals board in the 
mid1970s the nominee noted that legalized abortion was the law 
of the land after the 1973 supreme court decision in roe vs 
wade 
while indicating that some trustees might have had moral 
scruples against abortion he said we did not believe it was 
appropriate to impose those views on the hospital 
souter attempted to distance himself from his involvement as 
state attorney general in two freedomofreligion controversies of 
the 1970s 
in one he defended gov meldrim thomsons order that flags on 
all state government buildings be flown at half staff on good 
friday to commemorate jesus christs death 
in the other he prosecuted two jehovahs witnesses for covering 
the state motto live free or die on their automobile license 
plates 
noting that the flaglowering order was struck down by a federal 
judge in boston souter said if i were sitting as a judge today 
i probably would have ruled the same way as did the judge in that 
case 
and he conceded that new hampshires interest in the license tag 
case was not particularly compelling 
an interesting exchange occurred when sen charles grassley 
riowa complained about activist judges and asked souter about 
rights created by the courts 
the supreme court should only act and can only act when it 
has the judicial responsibility under the constitution but the 
supreme court is left to act alone when the political branches do 
not act beforehand souter said 
citing the 1954 high court decision that outlawed racial 
segregation in americas public schools he said we had brown 
vs board of education because we had no decision from any 
other branch of the government at any other level of the 
government facing the undoubted constitutional problem that had to 
be solved 
souter said congress willingness to aggressively protect the 
constitutions promise of equal protection of the law for all is 
welcome so the court is not left in the position of seeming to be 
the only guarantor of some of the very liberties that we must most 
be concerned with 
he added judges are not the only people in our governmental 
structure who are sworn to uphold the constitution and to try to 
make it work the executive the president of the united states 
takes such an oath all of you take such an oath you are just 
as much responsible for making good on the constitutions 
guarantees as we are in the judiciary 
souter who spent seven years on the new hampshire supreme court 
before being named a federal appeals court judge by bush last 
april would become the supreme courts 105th justice if confirmed 
the judiciary committee will vote on souters nomination after 
completing its hearings sometimes next week the nomination then 
will go to the full senate

a proposal to bottle and sell water 
from the citys reservoirs fell flat and now officials cant even 
give it away 
this week city officials tried to donate surplus water to the 
troops in saudi arabia but were told the military is more 
interested in transporting tanks 
everybody wants to give us water said gordon newell 
spokesman for westover air force base in chicopee one gentleman 
called and offered to give us 60000 gallons 
looking for sources of cash for the city mayor mary hurley has 
been promoting a plan to bottle and sell springfields water which 
city officials tout as pure and goodtasting 
but no private companies have submitted bids for bottling water 
from the reservoir prompting city officials to send the matter 
back to committee 
hurley meanwhile offered the water to the air force 
city officials said all went well until base officials asked how 
the water was packaged 
the answer was that it came out of the tap and base officials 
balked at the thought of bottling their own 
newell said water weighs 83 pounds per gallon and would be too 
much even for the huge c5a transport planes that fly out of 
westover 
the 337th military air lift squadron at westover has been 
activated to help with the airlift of supplies to the middle east 
as far as putting huge amounts of water on we would have to 
take priority cargo off he said theres plenty of water in 
saudi arabia they have desalinization plants everywhere 
still newell said base officials appreciated the thought

shock waves from the persian gulf crisis 
rippled through the economy in august as record increases in oil 
prices sent wholesale inflation surging and pushed retail sales 
into a nose dive 
the labor department said wholesale prices were up 13 percent 
last month the steepest rise in seven months private economists 
were pessimistic about future reports 
the worst is yet to come said allen sinai chief economist 
at the boston co 
the government blamed virtually all the increase on higher oil 
costs that followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
a 169 percent increase in the price of gasoline and the 625 
percent rise in crude petroleum were the highest onemonth 
increases recorded since the government began tracking those 
commodities in 1947 
also setting a onemonth record was fuel oil which soared 388 
percent kerosene diesel fuel and residual fuels also hit new 
highs 
the fallout from the middle east upheaval has heightened 
economists fears that higher inflationary pressures could push an 
already weak us economy into a recession 
in more weak economic news the government said industrial 
production dropped 02 percent in august that poor showing in 
factory activity the manufacturing sectors worst monthly 
performance since april was also linked to higher energy prices 
analysts said 
fridays data was the first hard evidence that the oil crisis 
has indeed had a staggering effect while private analysts only 
expected inflationary pressures to worsen in coming months the 
white house tried to sound a note of calm 
president bush called the big jump in wholesale inflation a 
matter of concern given the state of the economy but he insisted 
that energy prices had been pushed higher because of unfounded 
market fears about possible shortages of supplies 
the speculative atmosphere belies the reality which is that 
there are sufficient petroleum products bush said the market 
should not be going for higher prices 
private economists were far more discouraging 
the economic consequences of the iraqi event is going to be 
worse than we expected in terms of costs to the us economy in 
lost growth and higher inflation said the boston cos sinai 
the initial round is so large it implies that the 
ripplethrough effect in coming months will be quite sizable he 
said 
robert dederick of the northern trust co of chicago said 
fridays data on high wholesale inflation coupled with weak 
growth indicates the iraqi conflict threatens to push a vulnerable 
us economy into recession 
it may well be the shock that broke the camels back because 
the back was already bending dederick said 
augusts inflation outbreak is likely to become more entrenched 
analysts said filtering through to the thousands of plastic 
chemical and other products made with petroleum oil also figures 
into products that must be transported long distances and shows up 
in utility costs as well 
its a component thats embedded in everything its not 
something you can hide from said peter radford of national 
westminster bancorp of new york its like ripples in a pool 
youve just seen the wave in the middle and its going to go all 
the way out through the rest of the economy 
while wholesale inflation sped upward a separate commerce 
department report showed that retail sales slumped 06 percent 
with declines in nearly every category that drop is worrisome 
analysts said because consumer spending or the lack of it 
represents twothirds of the nations economic activity 
the august rise in wholesale prices was the largest since a cold 
snap caused a 19 percent spurt in january if the price of 
finished goods rose as much as they did in august each month it 
would translate into an annual increase of 164 percent 
so far this year wholesale inflation has risen at an annual 
rate of 46 percent the government said 
on tuesday the government will provide its first look at 
inflation at the consumer level since the turmoil began in the 
middle east that report is expected to be equally bad given the 
fact that pump prices of gasoline went up almost immediately 
while energy costs overall rose 95 percent in august food 
costs were up as well rising 08 percent 
prices for goods excluding volatile food and energy items 
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying 
inflationary pressures rose 03 percent in july that socalled 
core rate had declined 01 percent for the first drop in a year

britain is sending the 7th armored brigade 
successors to the desert rats of world war ii to saudi arabia with 
120 tanks and some 6000 combat troops to bolster the multinational 
force the government said friday 
and canadian prime minister brian mulroney said a squadron of 12 
cf18 jets would be sent to fly cover for three canadian warships 
en route to the gulf 
the announcements came as nato officials severely criticized 
iraq after its troops raided canadian french and belgian 
diplomatic compounds in kuwait early friday the united states has 
been requesting additional allied support for its buildup in the 
gulf 
british defense secretary tom king said the dispatch of the 
armored brigade would ensure that iraqi president saddam hussein 
understood that if un sanctions fail other options remain 
available and that one way or another he will lose 
we wish to see this settled by peaceful means king said 
but we make it absolutely clear that should it not result in the 
successful removal of iraqi forces from kuwait then we rule out no 
other option including the military option 
king said britain also will send another squadron of 12 tornado 
ground attack aircraft to join three royal air force fighter 
squadrons and additional air defense aircraft 
the british decision marked the first dispatch of tanks and 
significant ground troops by a western country besides the united 
states since iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 
in a related development the west german government prevented 
by its constitution from deploying forces outside the nato area 
said it had given the united states a list of more than 50 merchant 
ships that could be used to transport american troops to the gulf 
us secretary of state james a baker iii this week urged nato 
allies to send ground troops even in token numbers to symbolize 
shared involvement with the military buildup 
british officials said prime minister margaret thatcher decided 
with her cabinet friday to make a more concrete show of support 
the deployment of any troops is obviously political in terms 
of value said ian kemp a military analyst at janes the 
defense specialist publishers but an armored brigade is 
militarily the most useful thing that the united kingdom can 
send 
the 7th armored brigade based in west germany is the successor 
of the 7th armored division which fought the italians and then 
hitlers afrika corp 
the desert rats derived their nickname from the libyan jerboa 
which became their emblem their tanks clashed in the desert with 
the legendary afrika corp commanded by gen erwin rommel in some of 
the most famous battles of world war ii 
under the command of field marshal bernard montgomery the 
brigade fought a series of crucial battles at el alamein and sidi 
rezegh which led to the british recapture of the port of tobruk in 
november 1942 
officials indicated the brigade will take at least a month to 
get to saudi arabia in a 47 million transport operation it will 
cost about 2 million a day to keep there doubling the pricetag of 
britains military commitment in the gulf 
opinion polls show most britons back mrs thatchers bullish 
reponse to the iraqi invasion 
the british tanks will join a us force of about 1000 tanks 
being assembled in opertion desert shield 
the brigade includes two armored regiments with 120 heavily 
armored challenger tanks an armored infantry battalion with 
warrior armored fighting vehicles a squadron of scimitar combat 
vehicles an artillery regiment and an air defense battery with 
javelin missiles

us and australian naval frigates fired 
warning shots friday to halt an iraqi tanker and inspect it for 
cargo prohibited under the un embargo against iraq the pentagon 
said 
a joint boarding party from the two ships the uss brewton and 
the hmas darwin boarded the alfao and determined the ship 
contained no prohibited cargo officials said 
the vessel halted in the gulf of oman was allowed to proceed 
after five hours to the iraqi port of basra 
president bush queried about the incident at an impromptu 
session with reporters at the white house said the incident hadnt 
brought the united states nearer to war with iraq 
i wouldnt put it closer to a war situation i still hope that 
this matter can be peacefully resolved and the way for that to 
happen is for iraq to comply with the sanctions bush said 
it was the third shooting incident in the effort to put a 
stranglehold on iraqi shipping and the second time an iraqi ship 
had been boarded in the barricade earlier the iraqi vessel 
zanoobia was boarded and diverted after it was determined to be 
carrying tea a prohibited cargo 
on aug 6 four days after iraq invaded kuwait the un 
security council authorized the dozens of warships gathered in the 
region to use military force to uphold its sanctions 
bush emphasized that the action was taken in according with 
the united nations resolutions in accordance with the sanctions 
the president said the warning shots were fired because it 
required a bit of a warning before the captain pulled over and 
permitted the boarding party to have a look 
in a statement the pentagon said the 41400ton tanker was 
reported to have no cargo aboard 
after several requests to permit boarding the brewton fired 
the first warning shots from one of its 50caliber machine guns 
the pentagon said the darwin fired a second set of warning 
shots also from a 50caliber machine gun about 10 minutes 
later 
the tankers master then announced he would stop the ship and 
permit the boarding the pentagon said 
a joint boarding party boarded the tanker conducted a 
coordinated investigation and determined that the ship contained no 
prohibited cargo the pentagon statement said 
the first shots in the interdiction effort were fired aug 18 
when us navy ships attempted to halt two iraqi tankers neither 
ship was boarded 
the us forces now joined by the naval forces of several 
other nations are in the persian gulf region to enforce the 
unimposed economic sanctions in the hope of forcing iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait

the sounds of war rumbled across the saudi 
arabian desert friday the target a piece of white cheesecloth 500 
yards across the sand 
it was the third day the saudi government allowed us forces to 
use live ammunition to test tanks and heavy machine guns and the 
first time reporters were allowed to watch 
on the way bellowed the commanders from the 1st tank 
battalion before a shell was launched toward the targets the 
earsplitting blast from the 105mm gun shook the sand underfoot 
between blasts the 50caliber machine guns from another 
battalion thundered in the background 
the practice range in the northern saudi arabian desert was 
about 10 miles inland from the coastal road the marine units are 
assigned to protect defense department media rules prohibit 
reporting exact locations or mention of specific numbers of troops 
and weapons 
lt col mike kephart commander of the tank battalion said the 
livefire tests helped build confidence and boost morale 
any time they fire a gun feel the recoil of the tank smell 
the gunpowder they are motivated said kephart of bremerton 
wash 
the tests were used to calibrate the gunsights of the tanks and 
machine guns which have been in storage for up to two years aboard 
the marines mobile prepositioning ships stationed in the western 
pacific 
the men stationed at camp pendleton calif have been in saudi 
arabia for about 10 days preparing the equipment 
its like hunting deer said staff sgt scott rice 30 of 
fallbrook calif 
kephart said there had been no problems with the equipment and 
that few tanks required adjustments 
marines said their older m60 tanks lack thermal gunsights and 
sophisticated laserrange finders that give great accuracy through 
darkness dust or smoke but some nightvision gear compensated for 
the shortcomings 
the marines are formulating battle plans assuming they could 
face iraqs most sophisticated sovietdesigned t72 tanks 
they can easly destroy us as we can destroy them at 2400 
meters the best tactic is to flank him and get him from the 
side said sgt david harpst of toledo ohio 
reflections from the intense desert sun makes targeting 
difficult and the heat makes the guns droop slightly which can 
cause up to sixfeet inaccuracy in shots at the maximum range of 
2000 yards 
before the first shot was fired helicopters swept out into the 
range for up to 12 miles looking for camps of nomadic bedouins and 
camel herds 
a local village leader rides along to explain what is happening 
a few bedouins camped near the test range the first day did not 
return they know once we start firing to get out of there 
kephart said 
camels are harder to chase off 
were told that if we shoot one we have to eat it so were 
being very careful kephart said

a variety show with women dancers 
that expatriates were staging as a morale booster for us troops 
was canceled friday after the saudi government complained military 
officials said 
the saudis said their objection was based on television coverage 
of the show which lt col john olsen a us military spokesman 
said caused some discomfort on the part of the saudi government 
and we regret that 
the saudis apparently found a burlesquelike dance routine in 
the first act of the show especially offensive they complained to 
us military officials after monitoring the show on cbs which 
aired a brief segment showing four women dancers 
they objected in general but it was pretty clear that it was 
the women that set them off said a military source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
olsen said the military decided it would not send audiences to 
the shows because of the saudi objections 
the episode is the latest in a series of incidents that have 
caused increasing cultural strains between the americans and their 
saudi hosts 
earlier in the week the saudi government complained to us 
commanders about american soldiers venturing into saudi towns 
carrying their weapons saudi officials have also been relaying 
complaints about women in the military driving on saudi roads 
women are not allowed to drive here 
the 90minute show was being staged by a group of americans 
britons and other westerners who wanted to show their appreciation 
to the thousands of americans deployed in operation desert shield 
at opening night wednesday 400 members of the 82nd airborne 
were repeatedly brought to their feet by the performers and many 
said afterward that the show was a break from the heat boredom and 
isolation of the desert 
a second show was staged wednesday night and two more on 
thursday but two planned for friday night were effectively 
canceled when military officials responding to the saudi 
complaint said they would not allow troops to attend 
the troupe had planned to put on six shows next week and hoped 
to continue the show for several weeks to allow troops to be 
rotated in for entertainment while awaiting the arrival of 
entertainers being brought in by the uso 
we were just trying to give the guys a break one of the 
organizers of the show said insisting on anonymity because of 
fears she would be pealized for participating we were worried 
what might happen if the saudis found out 
from the outset saudi and american officials have predicted 
some cultural clashes as the 100000plus american troops settled 
in and began to interract with saudis 
after weeks of relatively few incidents the last week has become 
tense with several us commanders complaining privately the 
saudis appear unwilling to bend their traditions 
saudi offials in turn have complained the americans were 
unnecessarily engaging in activities that offended local customs 
during a thursday visit by gen colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff a saudi official walked up to a senior 
american officer here and argued furiously that servicewomen be 
sent home or at least prohibited from driving 
the officer gen gus pagonis who is in charge of the logistics 
and supply efforts for the us deployment could hardly get a word 
in as the saudi official who refused to identify himself 
afterward insisted that driving by women be halted 
im trying to hold back but i must perform my mission 
pagonis told the official they must perform the mission 
saudi women appear in public draped in clothing that covers 
their faces arms and legs western women also are advised cover 
their calves and arms when in public here

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said friday that the billions of dollars the united 
states expects to receive from its allies for the operation against 
iraq must come under congressional regulations 
weve got to make sure that we dont lose the power of the 
purse sen sam nunn dga told reporters at a seminar on us 
defense policy after the cold war 
he was quick to add that the administration isnt trying to 
usurp the congress however theres some very sticky 
questions he said 
expressing what has been an increasing concern on capitol hill 
nunn said any of the money from saudi arabia or allies contributed 
to help defray the cost of the us military buildup should not be 
placed in accounts that only the bush administration could control 
saudi arabia could contribute 1 billion and the administration 
could spend it any way they want to they could even take it and 
put it on the b2 bomber he said 
congress nunn said should approve a statute to ensure that 
whatever money the united states receives must be subject to 
appropriations and the congress has to approve that 
we do not want to get a situation where we have bank accounts 
floating around and the executive branch basically able to spend 
that money nunn said 
another panelist at the seminar rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee agreed 
aspin is working on an amendment to the house version of the 
fiscal 1991 defense bill that would prevent the administration from 
using the money as it pleases 
the senate has approved its version of the defense bill a 289 
billion package for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 the house 
began work on a 283 billion military spending plan this week but 
has postponed further action because of white house and 
congressional negotiations on trimming 50 billion from the federal 
deficit 
he recalled a statement made by one of the nations founding 
fathers george mason who said neither the executive nor the 
legislative branches of government should be able to combine the 
power of the sword and the power of the purse 
the seminar was sponsored by the progressive policy institute

democrats formally backed president bushs 
persian gulf policy friday but coupled their endorsement with a 
scathing attack on his domestic policies 
a resolution adopted by the executive committee of the 
democratic national committee denounced a decade of republican 
greed and debt and blamed the savings and loan scandal on 
hearnothing republican regulatory policy 
the resolution was the principal action at the opening session 
of the partys twoday meeting 
another highlight was the appearance of sen sam nunn of 
georgia making his first speech to a national committee meeting 
five years ago nunn was a founder of the democratic leadership 
council which was created as a conservative counterweight to the 
national party 
nunns denied his appearance before the executive committee was 
a signal he is interested in running for president in 1992 
i have no inclinations or plans to run for president nunn 
told reporters who crowded around him as he left the party meeting 
the senator has stirred presidential speculation with such 
actions as his resignation from the allmale burning tree golf club 
and his recent declaration of support for abortion rights after 
decades of being in the opposition camp 
nunn said his interest in party politics began with formation of 
the dlc which he described as an effort to get the democratic 
party back in the mainstream 
asked if he thought the people hed just spoken to were now in 
the mainstream nunn replied well i dont know everybody 
here 
nunn said he didnt think the tendency of americans to rally 
around the president in a time of crisis would hurt democratic 
candidates in the fall 
i dont think its a partisan issue he said i dont 
think the publics going to be voting in november based on the 
middle east 
like the democrats he addressed nunn was quick to praise bushs 
handling of the crisis 
i think hes done a very good job said the senator 
the resolution adopted by the democrats opened with the 
statement that today our nation stands united in support of 
americas mission in the middle east united in opposition to 
iraqs aggression we the democratic party of the united states 
do here formally express our support for our armed forces and the 
persian gulf policy of our commanderinchief 
the praise stopped at the shore of the persian gulf 
the next paragraph called on the nation to abandon republican 
economic policies 
the party voiced agreement with bushs call for spending 
reductions but added that we insist that those reductions must 
not discriminate against those who benefited least from a decade of 
republican greed and debt 
it said the sampl crisis is the certain result of donothing 
republican public philosophy hearnothing republican regulatory 
policy and seenothing republican administration of justice 
the full democratic national committee was scheduled to adopt 
the resolution at its meeting on saturday

president mikhail s gorbachev presented to the 
national parliament an economic reform plan friday that proposes 
marketoriented policies and other measures to halt the nations 
slide toward bankruptcy 
but gorbachev rejected the russian parliaments conclusion that 
the solution to the economic crisis requires stripping the central 
government of much of its power the gorbachev plan refused to 
surrender the kremlins power to tax or give republics laws 
superiority over national ones 
gorbachevs disagreement with the russian parliament reduces 
hope of a national consensus by the oct 1 deadline set by the 
president 
industrial output has dropped to the point of economic 
depression which worsens with every month according to a copy 
of his plan obtained by the associated press 
the international economic position of the country is 
catastrophic the governments solvency is not guaranteed and 
foreign debt is growing rashly it says 
without prompt action we would be forced to choose between 
hyperinflation and direct seizure of cash from the population and 
enterprises the plan says 
already some regions of the soviet union are refusing to trade 
with each other or resorting to barter 
the soviet union stopped paying its international bills on time 
months ago and has sold vast amounts of diamonds and gold in recent 
months to raise cash 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov said tuesday that imports of 
medicine and consumer goods could be cut by twothirds because of 
lack of foreign currency he said the nations loan debt service 
has risen to 125 billion a year and that western banks were 
refusing to lend the soviet union more money 
gorbachevs report is a combination of a conservative ryzhkov 
plan with the moreradical 500day plan approved by the russian 
parliament tuesday 
it accepts large parts of the russian proposal written by 
economist stanislav shatalin including selling government property 
to the public followed by a gradual freeing of stateset prices 
but gorbachevs proposal rejects the russian call for the nation 
to become a union of sovereign states similar to the european 
community thirteen of the 15 soviet republics are pursuing 
independence or sovereignty defined as the superiority of the 
republics laws over national ones 
economist abel aganbegyan told a parliamentary committee session 
friday that the sovereignty question should be settled under 
the new union treaty which is presently under negotiation 
but russian deputy prime minister grigory yavlinsky argued it is 
already too late to prevent the republics from deciding key 
questions such as land and housing 
aganbegyan also said it would be sheer madness to bypass the 
500day program because it had won the approval of representatives 
of all the 15 republics of the soviet union the russian republic 
is the largest 
gorbachevs plan agrees with the russian program in calling for 
distribution of housing and land and for cutting the 105 billion 
budget deficit by 10 billion gorbachevs plan also would cut 
government investment sharply reduce foreign aid and seek to sell 
off other nations debts to the soviet union 
but it waters down some critical points in the 500day plan 
which calls for a 10 percent to 20 percent cut in the defense and 
kgb budgets 
gorbachev proposes significant reductions in both bugets but 
a recommended figure is blacked out on the copy distributed to 
legislators 
other items that the russian plan foresees in its first 100 days 
of implementation but which are dropped in the gorbachev plan 
include 
ending all industrial subsidies on jan 1 
selling off 50 to 60 stateowned firms to individual 
stockholders 
selling off stateowned vehicles unfinished construction 
projects and construction materials 
gorbachevs plan agrees to dividing collective farms into 
individual plots and permits local councils to distribute land 
gorbachevs package also would cut the artificially high 
exchange rate on trade from the current 60 rubles for 1 to 2 
rubles for 1 on nov 1 the black market rate is 20 to 25 rubles 
for 1 
holders of foreign currency would be allowed to sell it at 
auction to the highest bidder starting in october

solidarity chairman lech walesa says he 
will win if he decides to run for president of poland 
walesa said he will make up his mind shortly on whether to be a 
candidate in elections expected to be held by spring 
my victory is rather certain he said during his weekly news 
conference thursday in solidaritys home city of gdansk 
i am not worried about victory but about its scale walesa 
said the situation is hard and if the president is elected with 
only 50 percent of the vote he will have to work 48 hours a day 
thus he must win 80 percent 
if his former ally and adviser prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki decides to run against him mazowiecki would win 35 
percent of the vote walesa predicted 
mazowiecki has not announced whether he will be a candidate 
walesa has split with his handpicked choice for prime minister 
over the pace of economic and political reforms walesa charges 
that mazowieckis government is proceeding too slowly to remove 
communist holdovers from state industries and agencies and has 
lost touch with society 
the worse thing is societys nonparticipation and today 60 
percent of society doesnt participate in anything walesa said 
he has called for early fully democratic presidential and 
parliamentary elections citing the current arrangement as dated 
parliament was elected in june 1989 with the thencommunist 
authorities guaranteed seats for the party and its allies since 
then a solidarityled government has taken power and the communist 
party has dissolved 
president wojciech jaruzleski the former communist party leader 
elected to a sixyear term in 1989 has said he is prepared to 
resign at the appropriate time 
parliament is to discuss the election schedule next week 
mazowiecki has agreed with the need for speedy elections he 
said thursday that one should put an end to a state in which 
there are no elections but a permanent electoral campaign

nelson mandela said friday 
that he and president fw de klerk had concluded a hidden hand 
was orchestrating the black township fighting to undermine peace 
talks aimed at blackwhite power sharing 
five blacks were killed in soweto on friday and 15 others were 
thrown from moving trains and injured in johannesburg police said 
on thursday night youths with guns and machetes killed 26 people 
and injured more than 100 on a train traveling from johannesburg to 
soweto 
we are dealing with highly professional killers mandela 
the african national congress leader said at a johannesburg news 
conference after meeting with de klerk in pretoria 
the government is convinced this is no longer a clash between 
black and black he said there is a hidden hand here the 
government intends to track down 
asked who he thought was responsible mandela said we dont 
know but we have our own suspicions he refused to elaborate 
almost 800 blacks have died in the townships ringing 
johannesburg since fighting erupted in early august the main 
combatants have been zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha 
movement and xhosas and other blacks supporting mandelas anc 
antiapartheid groups have alleged that police rogue elements 
of the security forces and white extremists have spurred on the 
fighting witnesses in several townships have claimed that masked 
white men participated but no proof has been offered 
de klerk said in a statement that unidentified groups were 
attempting to sabotage government efforts to end apartheid and draw 
up a new constitution free of racial discrimination 
there are forces which do not wish peaceful negotiations to 
succeed he said all those forces desiring peace must stand 
together to identify and counter these forces 
the president promised strong and comprehensive action but 
he did not elaborate 
mandela said he expected de klerk to announce steps monday to 
curb the violence the anc would not oppose an increased army 
presence in the township as long as the troops maintain law and 
order mandela said 
but he accused soldiers currently in black areas of behaving 
like an army of occupation and using live ammunition 
unnecessarily 
many black township residents see the army as a more effective 
and neutral force than the police 
the anc and inkatha the two largest black political movements 
both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and plans for a 
future south africa 
the anc waged a 29year guerrilla campaign against the whiteled 
government before suspending its armed struggle last month the anc 
still supports confrontational measures such as boycotts sanctions 
and strikes to pressure the government 
inkatha led by mangosuthu buthelezi and made up almost entirely 
of zulus does not endorse such tactics and participates in the 
governments black homeland system 
inkatha favors a capitalist economy while the anc has an 
ideological preference for socialism

the chairman of the house banking committee on 
friday described some government sales of failed savings and loans 
in late 1988 as a giveaway and said many of the deals should be 
renegotiated 
the bush administrations top banking official said the 
government is considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale 
contracts but does not intend to break them 
in a report released at fridays hearing investigators for the 
committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts received 78 
in assets and governmentgranted benefits for every 1 of capital 
they put up to buy the institutions 
these socalled deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway 
with the recipients of the government largesse being some of the 
fattest of the nations financial fat cats rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas said at the hearing we are hopeful that there 
can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses 
gonzalez said his committee will haunt the resolution trust 
corp the agency responsible for disposing of failed sampls until 
we have hard evidence that everything is being done to recover as 
many of the billions as possible 
l william seidman who heads the rtc and the federal deposit 
insurance corp told the committee that the rtcs efforts are to 
minimize costs to the government within the provisions of the 
contracts 
we are not considering breaking the governments agreements 
he said 
m danny wall a former government official who directed the 
1988 sales defended the deals as an effort to transfer into 
private hands insolvent sampls that were draining billions of dollars 
from the federal insurance fund 
our goal was a simple one stem the flow of red ink with the 
tools and dollars at hand said wall chairman of the nowdefunct 
federal home loan bank board it was clear to me and my fellow 
board members that time was money inasmuch as a problem 
institution unresolved loses more money every day as is abundantly 
clear today 
wall was accompanied by former members of the bank board and 
former officials of the federal savings and loan insurance corp 
lawrence j white a former member of the bank board said the 
deals were financially sound and cost the government 47 
billion less than the estimated cost of liquidating the failed 
thrifts 
the banking committee report concluded that 94 sampl deals 
completed in late 1988 will cost the government around 71 billion 
in assistance to buyers of the thrifts including up to 42 
billion in tax breaks 
the investigators study focused particularly on the sales of 
american savings bank fa of california and two giant texas thrifts 
southwest savings association and first gibraltar federal savings 
bank 
in the american savings and first gibraltar deals the buyers 
were given generous tax breaks the study said 
a separate report released late thursday by the general 
accounting office found that the rescue of american savings will 
cost taxpayers 52 billion three times the governments original 
estimate the institution was purchased by a group led by 
billionaire investor robert m bass 
southwest savings was purchased in 1988 by caroline hunt the 
daughter of legendary oil man hl hunt with the help of 
government subsidies projected to total 2 billion over 10 years 
despite the federal aid the thrift failed a second time and went 
back to the government

former president reagan praised polands 
democratic struggle friday but warned postcommunist leaders that 
difficult times may come and they must treat each other as 
opponents not as enemies 
reagan making his first visit to poland was interrupted by 
applause 10 times during a 45minute speech to parliament members 
and political leaders in warsaws royal castle 
i have always believed that where freedom is any friend of 
freedom will feel at home and i have been waiting a long time to 
say to the people of poland today on your soil i feel at home 
said reagan who imposed strict sanctions on poland after the 
communists imposed martial law in 1981 
many current political leaders in poland credit the sanctions 
with helping to pressure the government into democratic 
concessions 
poland was the second stop on reagans 10day european trip 
earlier he visited berlin and chipped at the berlin wall he is 
scheduled to leave saturday for the soviet union and also plans to 
visit italy 
even though many americans have never met a pole your 
struggle for liberty has moved us deeply said reagan 
reagan also alluded to recent political discord in poland 
between solidarity chairman lech walesa and prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki 
it is natural that you will fight hard among yourselves on 
issues of great importance he said to protect the liberty you 
have won at such a cost you will need a full measure of the 
tolerance and openness that are polands tradition for you 
historic transition means that you must fight as opponents not as 
enemies 
reagan planned to meet with mazowiecki and president wojciech 
jaruzelski the army general and former communist party leader who 
imposed martial law but last year agreed to turn over the 
government to solidarity 
reagan and his wife nancy are scheduled to travel to the 
baltic port city of gdansk on saturday to see walesa and visit the 
shipyard where solidarity was born during strikes in august 1980 
before leaving berlin friday morning reagan spoke to about 
1000 us military personnel and their families praising the 
troops for playing an important role in the movements to democracy 
in eastern europe 
as a souvenir us ambassador vernon walters gave the former 
president one of the old berlin sector division signs that 
announces in four languages you are leaving the american

an east german official in charge of 
disbanding the secret police was stripped of those duties friday 
after lawmakers criticized him for keeping former agents on his 
payroll 
prime minister lothar de maiziere relieved interior minister 
petermichael diestel of reponsibility for a committee 
investigating the dreaded security arm of the old communist regime 
a spokeswoman said 
the change was the latest development in a chaotic government 
that will soon be out of business when west germany assumes control 
of the economically reeling country on oct 3 the formal date of 
german unification 
de maiziere spokeswoman angela merkel said eberhard stief state 
secretary in the ministry would take over the role of overseeing 
the secret police committee 
the committee last week gave the government a list of 5000 
people who once worked for the secret police unit known as the 
stasi and had been assigned to various government ministries 
officials subsequently fired or suspended nearly 60 people on 
the list still holding government posts most of them in diestels 
ministry 
parliament spent the better part of a 14hour session on 
thursday debating the recent allegations that the government was 
still rife with stasi agents 
however a vote to demand diestels resignation failed after de 
maiziere defended the interior minister who also is the deputy 
prime minister 
de maiziere relieved diestel of his duties in an effort to calm 
the political crisis merkel said diestel has become a focal point 
for lawmakers seeking a more aggressive purge of the old security 
apparatus 
merkel also said de maiziere would authorize an investigation of 
his cabinet ministers after the head of a previous committee 
investigating the stasi said four ministers had worked for the 
secret police 
meanwhile the man vying to be leader of a united germany 
visited about 22 activists occupying the former headquarters of the 
stasi 
the activists some of whom helped lead the democratic revolt 
against communism last fall are demanding public access to the 
files on 6 million people 
they also want the files to remain in east german territory 
after unification 
oskar lafontaine of the leftleaning social democrats is 
challenging west german chancellor helmut kohl in the dec 2 
elections for a united german government 
lafontaine told dissidents holed up in the stasi archives he 
would seek to accommodate their demands i am not here for 
campaign reasons he said 
the dec 2 election campaign has shaped much of the debate over 
german unification and has helped to dismember the oncebroad 
coalition government put together by de maiziere 
twelve of the 22 ministers have resigned or been fired the last 
few weeks because of incompetence or political feuds over 
unification

five months after the disappearance of a 
10yearold boy four young playmates revealed a dark summer 
secret they saw their pal fall to his death while playing atop an 
abandoned 120foottall grain silo 
police said friday the fatal plunge of ricky rodriguez in april 
was accidental but his friends kept quiet in fear they would be 
blamed 
they were scared said detective eileen guest a youth 
officer theyre just little boys and they thought they were 
going to get into trouble 
the body was discovered thursday in an abandoned grain silo at a 
deserted falstaff brewing corp plant on the citys southeast side 
friends said ricky fell to his death as the five youths bounced on 
conveyor belts spanning the silo police said 
investigators interviewed each of the four playmates separately 
and concluded the boys death was accidental detective william 
marley said 
one friend told police he spent a terrifying summer haunted by 
the fall and fears police would not believe it was accidental 
he said he couldnt sleep that he had been having 
nightmares guest said the playmates were all about 10 years 
old police said 
police scoured the boys neighborhood after his disappearance 
using helicopters and scuba divers in lake michigan a picture of 
ricky recently was sent to millions of homes as part of a campaign 
for missing children 
we searched everywhere we could think of for this boy sgt 
robert jones said its really sad when a 10yearold is laying 
out there for all that time 
officers searching for the boy considered the deserted brewing 
plant virtually inaccessible he said 
the mystery unraveled thursday when a sister of one of rickys 
playmates overheard a conversation in which the boy said ricky had 
fallen she told her mother who notified police 
the boys entered the silo which had a locked door and climbed 
15 flights of stairs to get to the top guest said 
the area was fenced but these are little boys they had no 
problem getting over the fence she said its still unclear 
how they got into the building 
guest said the area had been abandoned for more than a decade 
she said she knew of no other reports or complaints of children 
entering the area 
on the afternoon of april 26 ricky stopped at home and asked 
his father what time he should be home for dinner it was the last 
time his family saw the fifthgrader 
well everybody can stop looking said the boys father 
steve rodriguez i thought he was dead the night he disappeared 
it just didnt fit his pattern but i was hoping

iraq trampled on a basic tenet of 
international law the inviolability of foreign diplomats and 
embassies when its troops forced their way into french canadian 
and dutch diplomatic quarters in kuwait scholars and former 
diplomats said friday 
frequently in history the retaliation for violating diplomatic 
immunity has been military action sometimes it has been war 
this is an extremely serious case said grant mcclanahan a 
retired diplomat and author of the 1989 book diplomatic immunity 
principles practices and problems 
its a very serious insult to the national dignity of the 
nations that suffer 
the principle of diplomatic immunity under which diplomats 
have freedom of movement and are free from arrest or taxation is 
formally enshrined in the vienna conventions of 1961 and 1963 
those conventions to which iraq is a signatory specifically 
say that the residences of diplomats are inviolate and can be 
entered by local authorities only with permission from the embassy 
iraq transgressed those provisions when its troops entered the 
residences of the french and other ambassadors in occupied kuwait 
iraqi president saddam hussein had already ignored international 
law by arbitrarily demanding the closure of diplomatic missions in 
kuwait and denying permission for some western diplomats to leave 
iraq 
the conventions say a nation cannot close an embassy of another 
country unless it first breaks relations and may not expel 
diplomats unless it declares them persona non grata iraq has 
done neither 
saddam has tried to muddy the legal waters by annexing kuwait 
and announcing that foreign diplomats there had lost their 
diplomatic status 
but david j scheffer an international lawyer and senior 
associate of the carnegie endowment for international peace says 
iraq has no legal justification for those declarations 
diplomatic law may not have precise rules on occupied countries 
but international law itself prohibits intervening occupying and 
annexing other countries scheffer said 
the concept of diplomatic immunity dates back to biblical times 
and became common practice from the mid15th century when foreign 
ambassadors first took up residence in the various italian 
citystates 
the protection of diplomats also has a strong basis in islamic 
law said nathan brown director of the middle east studies 
program at george washington university mohammed recognized the 
importance of good relations with nonmoslem states and the ottoman 
empire respected the rights of diplomats even when relations with 
europe were at their worst he said 
historically violations have been taken seriously 
hugo grotius known as the father of international law wrote in 
his 1625 book the law of war and peace that profane history 
is full of wars undertaken on account of the illtreatment of 
ambassadors also in the scriptures there is mention of a war which 
david waged against the ammonites on that account 
he enumerates many instances where the romans and later the 
french and germans took up arms to redress wrongs done to their 
diplomatic corps 
in more recent times the united states has frequently used 
force to protect its diplomats 
in 1854 troops destroyed a town in nicaragua to avenge an insult 
to an american envoy us forces were dispatched to china in 1866 
to punish an assault on an american consul and again during the 
1900 boxer rebellion when the foreign legation in beijing was under 
siege 
american forces were sent to chile in 1891 to protect americans 
who had taken refuge at the embassy during a war there and in 1918 
the marines landed in vladivostok to protect the american consulate 
during the bolshevikled civil war there 
the worst recent violation of diplomatic immunity was in 1979 
when iranian students seized the us embassy in tehran and held 52 
americans hostage for 444 days a botched military rescue attempt 
in april 1980 led to the deaths of eight american servicemen on the 
iranian desert 
the united states took liberties with diplomatic immunity when 
us troops forced their way into the residence of the ambassador 
of nicaragua during the us invasion of panama in december 
president bush acknowledged the mistake calling it a screwup 
scheffer said france and other countries whose diplomatic rights 
have been infringed upon are fully justified in expelling iraqi 
diplomats in retaliation but he said that under modern 
international law it would be difficult to equate insults to 
diplomats with acts of war 
how we respond to a threat to our diplomatic premises in 
kuwait is not going to be as easy to resolve as it was 100 years 
ago he said

us and australian sailors fired warning 
shots friday across the bow of an iraqi tanker sailing toward the 
persian gulf and then boarded the vessel american officials said 
in washington a pentagon source said the sailors fired friday 
from an american frigate in the gulf of oman and that an australian 
frigate helped in the operation a us navy spokesman in the gulf 
said the australian vessel had also fired a warning 
president bush speaking about the incident at an impromptu 
press conference in washington said he didnt believe it put the 
united states closer to a war situation 
i still hope that this matter can be peacefully resolved and 
the way for that to happen is for iraq to comply with the 
sanctions he said 
it was the third time during the gulf crisis that us officials 
announced american ships had fired warning shots in an effort to 
enforce the unordered embargo on trade with iraq there have 
been no injuries reported in any of the incidents 
the iraqi vessel boarded friday the alfao was first 
intercepted by the frigate burton the navy spokesman said on 
condition of anonymity its master said he was headed for the iraqi 
port of basra with no cargo but refused to allow the americans to 
board 
after repeated requests to allow boarding the burton fired 
the first warning shots from one of its 50caliber machineguns 
and requested that alfao stop and permit a team to board said 
the navy spokesman 
the australians fired the second set also from a 50caliber 
machinegun about 10 minutes later he said 
alfao then stopped and sailors from both frigates went on 
board said the spokesman 
the team discovered no prohibited cargo aboard and alfao was 
allowed to proceed he added he said the whole operation which 
began about 4 pm took five hours 
the alfao was one of two iraqi tankers that last month tried 
and failed to break a saudi arabian blockade on oil exports through 
iraqs transsaudi pipeline terminal on the red sea 
it was earlier reported anchored off yemen with its sister ship 
alqadissiyah after port authorities there denied them permission 
to enter the tanker apparently was sailing home when intercepted 
on aug 18 the us navy fired warning shots across the bows of 
two iraqi vessels that defied orders to stop but the vessels were 
allow to sail out of the persian gulf without being boarded 
the united states is leading the naval buildup designed to 
enforce the un sanctions imposed on aug 6 they are intended to 
force iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait which 
his forces invaded aug 2 
hundreds of ships are being chllenged in the persian gulf the 
connecting gulf of oman the red sea to block iraqbound cargo and 
iraqi exports 
the navy spokesman said the us navy alone has intercepted more 
than 900 vessels so far he said the number of vessels reported 
boarded has doubled in recent weeks to more than 40 but with 
little fanfare those actually diverted are fewer than than five 
british french italian and other warships have also carried 
out their own stopandsearch operations

the senate cleared the way friday for action 
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase 
fuel economy 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hoped 
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require 
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles 
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into 
effect but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure 
on the senate floor 
within hours of the vote transportation secretary samuel 
skinner blasted the legislation as unrealistic irresponsible 
and more important unattainable he said theres no technology 
to achieve the bills goals without making cars smaller 
it should be called the highway fatality bill skinner said 
at a news conference citing a new study by the national highway 
traffic safety administration that concluded a clear link between 
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths 
the nhtsa study said the introduction of smaller cars over the 
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1340 additional traffic 
deaths annually in singlecar accidents based on those numbers 
nhtsa administrator jerry curry said between 600 and 1140 
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to 
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard 
skinner said automakers had convinced him that the senate bills 
fuel economy goals cant be achieved without substantial weight 
reductions in cars 
weve just had the first inning of this nineinning game 
sen donald riegle dmich said after the senate voted 6828 to 
clear the way for debate 
we hope and intend to win this fight riegle said adding 
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off 
debate and bring it to a vote next week 
a similar bill has been introduced in the house but it has yet 
to be taken up by the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich is staunchly opposed to the 
measure 
rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of the house bill said 
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on 
the house floor in an effort to bypass dingells committee 
but the senates 6828 vote friday to cut off efforts by riegle 
to keep the measure off the senate floor was an indication of the 
growing support in congress for a measure to reduce us reliance 
on foreign oil a subject in the spotlight since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
its the single most important step to reducing our dependency 
on opec oil and curbing global warming the sierra club said of 
the bill sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev 
in floor debate riegle said those fuel savings arent likely to 
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to todays oil 
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an 
hour 
later a riegle aide said the senator didnt necessarily support 
a change in the speed limit 
bryan described his bill as a message to detroit and the 
automakers that theyre going to have to look at fuel economy and 
not just muscle cars 
it does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we dont 
start conserving now some future president may have to consider 
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the middle 
east he said

generosity is overwhelming the military agency 
responsible for shipping supplies to us troops in the middle 
east an official said friday 
the military received more than 100 offers of food magazines 
and other items since a donation hot line started this week but 
few can be accepted now without interrupting the flow of basic and 
priority items such as chemical suits and medicine said pat 
miller spokeswoman for the defense logistics agency 
the hot line which is being answered by three people has been 
ringing off the cook she said callers have offered videocassette 
recorders nintendo games even fresh lobster many want to donate 
water 
some even collected water with the misunderstanding or 
thinking that we needed it ms miller said but saudi arabia has 
modern desalination plants and local water supplies have been more 
than sufficient she said 
the calls show a tremendous outpouring of patriotism ms 
miller said but they have caused some headaches too 
agency officials friday had to explain to an angry church group 
why a truckload of cookies and baked goods couldnt be accepted at 
the military post office in new york ms miller said 
food items are just a really bad idea she said we have a 
way of packaging and shipping the menus that the services are 
requesting according to their own feeding plan 
offers for electronic and recreational items are also being 
turned away at least temporarily 
i wouldnt want to stifle that if were still there two 
months down the road some recreational items might be nice ms 
miller said 
after the armed forces radio network accepted a donation of 
25000 personal stereos the logistics agency agreed to take 30000 
prerecorded cassette tapes offered by a record company 
the agency procures items like food fuel and medicine that are 
used in common by all branches of the military 
in august agency statistics show it shipped 318000 chemical 
suits 200000 hot weather boots 100000 pairs of sunglasses 
nearly 27000 cans of chigger repellent 257000 bottles o 
sunscreen and 570000 dispensers of lip balm for operation desert 
shield 
ms miller suggested the best thing citizens could send to 
troops is a letter the agency has been accepting donations of 
stationary so soldiers can write back she said 
on wednesday the agency took an offer of 1000 reams of 
stationary from champion international corp a paper company based 
in stamford conn

president bush on friday condemned the iraqi 
breakin at frances diplomatic residence in kuwait as a matter 
of grave concern to the united states and said he had pledged to 
do all he could to support any french response 
he also said the us navy had fired warning shots and then 
boarded an iraqi tanker in the gulf of oman as part of the effort 
to enforce trading sanctions against iraq 
asked by reporters if his words and the us actions were meant 
as a saber rattling threat to iraqi president saddam hussein 
bush said no 
when i rattle a saber the man will know it he promised 
when an escalation is required from me saddam hussein will know 
it 
iraqi troops also entered the kuwait city compounds of belgium 
and canada capturing several french citizens and briefly detaining 
the us consul and four other western consuls who were visiting at 
canadas diplomatic residence at the time 
the us embassy in baghdad lodged a protest the state 
department withheld the name of the consul 
as for the naval warning shot and boarding bush said of the 
iraqi ship it required a bit of a warning before the captain 
pulled ovr and permitted the boarding party to have a look he 
added i expect confidently that if it is not carrying any 
contraband or anything that will violate the sanctions that it 
will be permitted to go on its way 
and the ship which also was boarded by sailors from an 
australian vessel that fired warning shots was indeed released 
later in the day 
bush said he had spoken by telephone to french president 
francois mitterrand after the iraqi soldiers broke into the french 
compound friday morning an action he called outrageous 
i just told him he has the full backing of the united 
states bush told reporters in a brief questionand answer 
session outside the white house before leaving for his weekend 
retreat at camp david md 
i dont know what france is going to do bush said after his 
conversation with mitterrand i told him that i view this as a 
matter of grave concern to the united states i told him i would do 
anything i could to support what he decides to do 
but bush would not be drawn into discussing whether he was 
contemplating military action 
we will continue to do everything possible to ensure that the 
sanctions work as intended and to deter and if need be to defend 
saudi arabia against armed attack he said 
he said the new incidents not only underscore the brutal 
behavior of iraq but also the international support that exists 
and is marshalled against iraqs occupation of kuwait 
bush was asked if the heightened activity on friday meant a war 
with iraq was closer 
i wouldnt put it closer to a war situation i still hope that 
this matter can be peacefully resolved through iraqi withdrawal 
from kuwait and release of foreign hostages he said 
any of these incidents all of them add up to clear 
violations of international law they do raise tensions they 
clearly do 
bush said he had spoken by telephone to japans prime minister 
toshiki kaifu thursday night and thanked him for his promise of 
increased financial support to pay for the us military effort in 
the gulf and to help poor countries suffering due to the 
unsponsored trade embargo against iraq 
he said he also talked to britains prime minister margaret 
thatcher who informed him she would dispatch a full armored 
brigade along with additional helicopters and aircraft to join 
us troops in saudi arabia 
also friday bush asked congress for an extra 19 billion to 
pay for the military buildup in the persian gulf and the white 
house disclosed he had warned iraq not to back any terrorist 
attacks against us interests 
bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the us charge 
daffaires in baghdad had warned the iraqi foreign ministry on 
thursday that we have cause for grave concern about any links 
between iraq and various terrorist organizations that we hold them 
responsible for any terrorist acts that might occur 
he said the warning was not based on any specific threats it 
considers credible but that us intelligence had found possible 
links between iraq and terrorist kinds of planning activities 
we have been concerned about this and we have made that known 
to saddam hussein fitzwater said 
richard boucher the state department spokesman said the 
administrations primary concern was that iraq might use its own 
intelligence apparatus to undertake terrorist operations 
the second source of concern are the many terrorist groups and 
radical elements that are either based in baghdad or that receive 
support from saddam husseins government he said 
bush sent a request to congress to increase 1990 spending to 
cover costs of the persian gulf militry action and to provide 
legal mechanisms that will allow the united states to accept 
donations from other countries that have volunteered to help bear 
the costs 
in addition bush sought congressional approval to forgive 7 
billion in military debt that egypt owes the united states bush 
said he wanted to forgive the debt in thanks for egypts 
cooperation in the us strategy against iraq 
meanwhile an additional 300 american women and children and 
nonamerican family members left kuwait friday morning en route to 
london they were due to arrive in baltimore on saturday 
an additional flight was scheduled to leave kuwait saturday

free mailing privileges have been approved for 
us service members deployed in the mideast the pentagon said 
friday 
the step is being taken in cooperation with the us postal 
service despite the lack of action on pending congressional 
legislation permitting such a move a statement said 
the decision clears up a problem that arose earlier this week 
when the postal service said it was ready to go ahead with the 
privilege but the pentagon said it lacked congressional 
authorization 
the free mail authorization will be funded by the postal service 
as an interim measure until legislation allows the appropriated 
funds for postage the pentagon said 
for troops in the field the military collects mail and 
transfers it to the postal service for dispersal 
service men and women will be allowed to send personal letters 
postcards and recorded cassettes 
they may from saudi arabia the united arab emirates oman 
bahrain and the adjacent waters to any place within the united

teenage thieves stole computer tapes containing 
vital information on the 1986 chernobyl nuclear plant disaster and 
erased data before officials could catch them the tass news agency 
said friday 
health data on 500000 residents of the region surrounding 
chernyobyl and information on radioactive contamination of 20000 
towns and villages was blanked out of the tapes stolen from the 
research institu press not 
to wipe off the data tass said their request was not 
heeded 
the news agency did not say when the theft took place how it 
was done or why the unspecified number of youths involved erased 
the data as for motive police official litsian sobolevsky was 
quoted only as saying the teenagers were after money 
technical experts were trying to salvage data from the disks 
tass said 
in a related development foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
gerasimov told a moscow news conference there was no danger of 
another explosion at the chernobyl plant where a reactor caught 
fire and exploded on april 26 1986 
reports in the west german news media last month quoted soviet 
experts who said they feared the floor of the damaged reactor could 
give way under the weight of concrete slabs and release huge 
amounts of radioactivity 
gerasimov said a concrete block reinforced with metal rods had 
been erected after the accident to prevent the escape of radiation 
and to protect the environment 
as a result of these measures the integrity of the structure 
has been insured for 30 years gerasimov said nothing terrible 
can happen there there can be no second explosion 
scientists are still studying how to carry out the final 
disposal of the damaged reactor gerasimov said 
the accident at chernobyl in the ukraine left 31 dead 
according to official count unofficial reports say 250 died 
the blast spewed cesium strontium and plutonium over a wide 
area of the ukraine byelorussia and russia and sent a cloud of 
radioactive gas around the world

the parents of a comatose missouri woman who 
was the subject of the supreme courts first decision on a persons 
right to die said friday they hope a new legal effort will allow 
their daughter to die 
the bottom line is we havent stopped fighting yet because we 
believe in what were doing said joe cruzan a sheet metal 
worker from carterville mo 
nancy cruzan 33 has been in a comalike state since she was 
injured in a 1983 car accident the supreme court in june blocked 
the cruzans request to end their daughters life 
cruzan and his wife joyce spoke here at a law and medical 
symposium on the right to die 
the couple asked a missouri state court last month for 
permission to remove the tube that provides food and water to their 
braindamaged daughter they said three people had come forward 
recently with information about her wishes concerning 
lifesustaining medical treatment 
no hearing has been held on the latest request 
the supreme court said the cruzans lacked clear and 
convincing proof that their daughter would want to die in the 
54 decision the justices said states have broad power to keep 
patients on lifesupport systems when they have not made their 
wishes known conclusively 
i feel like that the new witnesses coupled with the existing 
testimony if thats not clear and convincing then i dont know how 
youre going to achieve that unless nancy can raise up from her bed 
and write out something and then lay back cruzan said 
he said another option was to move their daughter to another 
state 
nancy cruzan can breathe on her own and at times her eyes are 
open and move randomly her body is rigid with her hands and feet 
bent into claw shapes 
looking back if i had to do it over again id probably do 
exactly the same thing i did then her father said if i knew 
then what i know now i would have probably tried to take her home 
and do it quietly because i know that its done

feminist leaders said friday the clock would 
be turned back 25 years on womens rights if david souter is 
confirmed as a supreme court justice 
if we lose this one well never get it back said eleanor 
smeal president of the feminist majority who is lobbying the 
senate to reject the nominee 
smeal said she had read all 200 of souters legal opinions and 
believes he would work to cut off womens access to birth control 
and abortion 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
said souter revealed his opposition to abortion by calling it the 
killing of unborn children 
thats the language of the right wing yard said 
souter did not use the words during the senate judiciary 
committee hearings this week but while new hampshire attorney 
general he signed a brief that contained the language 
however during the hearings friday souter said he has not made 
up his mind on the abortion rights issue and would consider both 
sides if he is confirmed 
i have not got any agenda on what should be done with roe vs 
wade souter in reference to the case that legalized abortion 
i would listen to both sides of that case i have not made up my 
mind and i would not go on the court saying i must go one way or i 
must go the other way 
but yard said that souters repeated reference to the abortion 
rights position as the other side was evidence of where he 
stood 
smeal and yard who have attended most of the hearings said 
souters answers to questions on constitutionally protected privacy 
rights concerning birth control indicated he believed in the 
concept for married couples but left open whether single people 
had the same right 
smeal said the addition of souter to the court would create the 
majority needed to whittle away at a womans right to abortion and 
birth control until access no longer existed 
it would take about 10 years she said first would be a 
requirement that teenagers get parental consent for an abortion 
then spousal consent 
she predicted the court then would restrict the time period in 
which an abortion could be performed and then limit the kind of 
facility that could do the operation 
those decisions would be followed by requirements that 
teenagers get parental consent for birth control requiring a 
physicians prescription and later that women get their husbands 
consent smeal said 
the last step would be outlawing the sale of birth control to 
single people she said that would take us back to 1965 
that year in griswold vs connecticut a case involving the 
sale of contraceptives the court for the first time recognized a 
constitutional right of privacy the decision led to widespread 
availability of birth control for married and unmarried people 
smeal said womens ability to get out from under the burden of 
unwanted pregnancies have been the key to the many advances they 
have been able to achieve outside the home 
smeal and yard spoke to a rally organized by now across the 
street from the capitol about 150 people opposing the souter 
nomination attended

zip commuters through congested downtown in about onethird the 
time it takes on the surface 
the twolane tunnel is expected to reduce downtown bus traffic 
25 percent by next fall and 40 percent by the end of the decade 
officials with metro the king county transit and 
sewagetreatment agency overseeing the project hope the tunnel 
entices new riders it will be months before metro knows whether 
downtown traffic has been eased and ridership is up 
metro ordered 236 italianmade buses at 525000 each 
deliveries are behind schedule however and there are only 51 new 
buses said metro spokesman dan williams 
the fivestation tunnel opens to the public saturday 
the mostly northsouth route stops at westlake mall stations in

has no lightrail system though the tunnel is equipped with 
recessed rails 
about 225000 people use metros buses daily and 84 percent of 
them travel to downtown seattle williams said

delegates from about 100 countries pledged to seek 
tighter conditions for exports of nuclear materials to countries 
that have not signed a treaty banning the spread of atomic weapons 
diplomats said friday 
oswaldo de rivero chairman of a conference reviewing compliance 
with the 1970 nonproliferation treaty said such a wide 
international call for tougher controls was unprecedented 
in a separate measure prompted partly by iraqs invasion of 
kuwait delegates urged the international atomic energy agency to 
strenthen its surveillance of nuclear installations to prevent 
clandestine production of atomic weapons 
iraq signed the nonproliferation treaty but has tried to import 
components that could be used in the manufacture of nuclear bombs 
the two recommendations were part of a final conference 
declaration that was expected to be adopted over the weekend 
delegates agreed to ask the viennabased international atomic 
energy agency to consider starting shortnotice inspections it 
currently inspects according to a fixed schedule 
participants also agreed to recommend to exporters of nuclear 
materials that they require as a precondition of doing 
business that customers have all atomic installations under the 
agencys surveillance de rivero told reporters 
the move is aimed at countries that have not signed the 
nonproliferation treaty and are believed to have nuclear weapons 
capability they include israel south africa brazil argentina 
india and pakistan 
the united states canada australia and sweden have already 
banned nuclear exports to countries refusing full inspection west 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told the conference 
his country plans to adopt the same restriction 
in a mainly symbolic move the united states the soviet union 
and britain pledged for the first time to defend nonnuclear states 
from attack de rivero said they are the three nations with 
nuclear capability that also have signed the nonproliferation 
treaty 
the move appeared aimed at addressing longtime concerns among 
nonnuclear states that the treaty is fundamentally unbalanced 
the treaty requires states that do not possess nuclear weapons 
to refrain from building or acquiring them in return the united 
states soviet union and britain pledge to work toward eliminating 
their arsenals and provide peaceful nuclear technology to other 
nations 
members meet every five years to review the treatys success 
about twothirds of the 141 member countries are attending the 
current session 
debate over disarmament goals was subdued this year because of 
superpower efforts to cut nuclear arms since 1985 and the lessening 
of cold war tensions de rivero said 
this produced a lot of compromises and tolerance among the 
parties he said 
two nuclear weapon states france and china are not formally 
affected by the conference since both have not signed the treaty 
however both sent conference observers for the first time in 
what western diplomats said was a sign that they might sign on 
in an annex to the final declaration france and china will join 
the three other nuclear states in reaffirming previous guarantees 
that they will never attack a nonnuclear state de rivero said

warning the federal government says homemade 
eggnog can be hazardous to your health 
so can homemade mayonnaise caesar salad and other dishes 
containing raw eggs 
the food and drug administration recommended friday that raw 
eggs be classified as a potentially hazardous food and said 
that improperly cooked eggs raise the danger of salmonella food 
poisoning 
specifically the agency urged people to stop using raw eggs for 
such dishes as caesar salad homemade mayonnaise eggnog and ice 
cream 
the warning was contained in 3500 notices sent to state and 
local food regulatory agencies 
labeling a food as potentially hazardous doesnt mean that 
a food is inherently unhealthful fda spokesman chris lecos said 
he said other perishable but perfectly wholesome nutritious 
foods such as meats dairy products and cooked vegetables are also 
considered potentially hazardous 
but he said the fda in conjunction with the agriculture 
department is trying to halt the spread of the salmonella 
enteriditis bacteria which has entered the genetic systems of some 
layer hens and contaminated their eggs 
agriculture department figures show there were 6604 illnesses 
and 43 deaths attributed to salmonella from january 1985 to last 
october eggs were implicated in 73 percent of 189 recorded 
outbreaks 
the fda notice advises that eggs be refrigerated at temperatures 
of 45 degrees fahrenheit or less and thoroughly cooked at 140 
degrees fahrenheit 
it says whole eggs should be cooked until the white is 
completely coagulated and firm and the yolk begins to thicken 
scrambled eggs need to be cooked until firm throughout 
restaurants and food service operations are told not to use raw 
eggs in uncooked readytoeat menu items and cooks are urged to 
substitute pasteurized eggs and egg products for shell eggs in 
recipes for salads sauces mayonnaise and ice cream calling for 
raw eggs 
louis b raffel president of the american egg board said egg 
producers agree on the need for precautions the industrys 
feeling is that eggs should be refrigerated and that proper 
handling at all levels is important to avoid any foodrelated 
diseases 
cathy mccharen vice president of the egg nutrition center in 
washington said the industry has been giving similar advice for 
the last two years the recommendations will force food handlers 
and restaurateurs to treat the egg with the kind of respect it 
deserves that we do want to see 
usda spokeswoman margaret webb said 56 salmonella outbreaks have 
been confirmed since february with 22 definitely linked to eggs 
she said eggs may also be implicated in other cases which have 
centered in the northeast and midatlantic states 
pennsylvania has reported nine outbreaks of the illness which 
can cause vomiting diarrhea and stomach cramps and can be fatal to 
the elderly and young children

engineers turned on magellans radar 
friday for the first time in a month preparing the sometimes 
unruly spacecraft to start mapping the rugged landscape of 
cloudcovered venus 
i personally am excited and jumping around said ed sherry 
technical assistant to the magellan project manager at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory 
the last and only other time engineers used magellans radar was 
during a picturemaking test on aug 16 only hours before they 
lost touch with the spacecraft for 14 hours radio contact was lost 
again for 17 hours starting aug 21 
i am delighted to see the blue sky that we knew was at the end 
of this tunnel sherry said friday after engineers received 
confirmation at 814 am pdt that they successfully turned on the 
radar 
magellans radar was to remain on standby until saturday when 
it will be ordered to send radar waves through venus thick clouds 
and bounce them off the rugged surface magellan then will collect 
the reflected radar echoes and send the data to earth where it 
will be made into pictures and maps 
if all goes well the national aeronautics and space 
administration hopes to release new pictures of venus early next 
week sherry said 
he cautioned that nasa may lose contact with magellan again 
because engineers have yet to determine the cause of the earlier 
blackouts 
but they have equipped magellan with new computer commands that 
should allow them to restore contact within four to 24 hours if it 
is lost again then resume mapping within two weeks 
nasas official stance is that magellans 744 million mapping 
mission wont start until late this month but if everything works 
well this weekend officials may declare retroactively that mapping 
began saturday sherry said 
were not being foolhardy and rushing into a restart of 
operations said david okerson a magellan engineer 
magellans first pictures of venus made during the aug 16 
radar test showed surprisingly violent forces shape the planet 
the pictures revealed vast flows of solidified lava volcanic 
cinder cones huge meteorite impact craters extensive 
venusquake faults numerous valleys and mountain ridges and 
large calderas the calderas are volcanic craters created when the 
summit of a volcano collapses as lava flows out from vents on the 
volcanos flanks 
sherry said that during the weekend magellan will fly over 
ishtar terra a continentlike highland area about the size of 
australia and a plain on ishtar that is named lakshmi planum 
optical cameras cant penetrate venus thick clouds magellans 
radar penetrates the clouds to make pictures 10 times more detailed 
than those produced by earthbased radar or radar on the soviet 
venera 15 and 16 spacecraft which visited venus in the mid1980s 
magellan went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after a looping 
948 millionmile voyage from earth it was launched from the space 
shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 
magellans primary mission will last 243 days the time it 
takes for venus to rotate once as magellan circles the planet in a 
nearly polar orbit 
the spacecraft should be able to map 70 percent to 90 percent of 
the surface during the initial mapping mission but nasa officials 
have said they expect to extend magellans mission so the entire 
planet can be mapped 
magellan made its aug 16 pictures during two orbits around 
venus but only 1 orbits worth of picture data were returned 
before contact was lost sherry said half the remaining picture 
information was radioed to earth on wednesday night engineers 
hoped to retrieve the remainder early saturday 
despite 900degree fahrenheit surface temperatures created by a 
runaway greenhouse effect venus is the planet most like earth 
in terms of size mass density and distance from the sun 
scientists hope to learn the extent to which venus is shaped by 
forces similar to those that sculpted earths terrain 
they are particularly interested in knowing if venus has plate 
tectonics which is the movement of giant plates of crustal rock 
that makes continents drift slowly across the face of the earth 
many scientists doubt venus has drifting plates and believe its 
crustal movements are caused by hot spots in which molten 
material bubbles upward the process that created the hawaiian 
islands on earth

nearly twothirds of americans surveyed in a 
poll released friday said they are closely following events in the 
persian gulf and a similar proportion think news media coverage of 
the crisis has been fair 
the poll commissioned by the times mirror center for the people 
amp the press also said some americans seem to be tiring of the 
extent of coverage of the gulf crisis 
the times mirror center is a washingtonbased public opinion 
research group owned by times mirror co publisher of the los 
angeles times and other newspapers 
sixtythree percent of those surveyed from sept 10 to 12 said 
they were very closely following news about the iraqi 
occupation of kuwait and the deployment of us forces to the gulf 
area in an august survey the figure was 66 percent 
the public also is keenly interested in several related stories 
the poll said 
fiftysix percent of those surveyed said they were closely 
following news about rising gasoline prices and 57 percent said 
they were tracking developments about americans and other 
westerners being held hostage in kuwait and iraq 
the only major aspect of the gulf story to gain little public 
interest was the helsinki summit sept 9 between president bush and 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the poll said 26 percent of 
respondents closely followed news of the summit 
last june following a bushgorbachev summit in washington a 
times mirror center poll said 38 percent kept a close eye on news 
about the meeting 
despite continued high public interest in news about the gulf 
crisis the survey indicated that some have tired of the extent of 
coverage fifteen percent of respondents volunteered that there was 
too much news on the subject 
americans gave the news media generally high marks for coverage 
of the crisis about twothirds said the media have treated the 
story fairly ten percent said the media have been too critical of 
american positions while 11 percent called coverage too 
supportive 
a plurality of those surveyed said the views of americans who 
oppose the buildup of us military forces in the gulf region have 
not been adequately aired forty percent expressed that opinion 
while 15 percent said critics have gotten too much coverage and 35 
percent said there was too little coverage of this 
when asked whether they favored using military force against 
iraq in the event that un economic sanctions fail to dislodge 
iraq from kuwait 63 percent said yes 24 percent said no 
and 13 percent said they didnt know 
the poll said 68 percent of respondents approved of bushs 
overall performance as president a decline from a 75 percent 
approval rating in an august times mirror center poll 
the survey was conducted for the times mirror center by the 
gallup organization in lincoln neb under the direction of 
princeton survey research associates the results are based on 
telephone interviews with 1244 adults 
the polls margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage

the government wants to keep us soldiers 
based in the philippines as long as theyre welcome a state 
department spokesman said friday after a congressman said us 
negotiators likely will propose a 10year phase out of american 
philippine bases 
spokesman richard boucher declined to discuss us negotiating 
positions in talks expected to open next week in manila on the 
future of two of the united states largest foreign bases 
we will continue to support a us military presence in the 
philippines if we are welcome to do so by the philippines he 
said we feel it would be premature to speculate on the outcome 
of the negotiations before the two sides meet 
the talks cover an agreement that allows unlimited us access 
to clark air base subic naval base and four smaller facilities 
until sept 16 1991 
on thursday rep stephen solarz chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs said he had 
talked with us negotiators who he said are considering a 10year 
phase out 
i have the impression that this is a timetable they are 
comfortable with and likely to propose the new york democrat 
said in a telephone interview 
rep james leach riowa minority leader on the solarz 
subcommittee said he had no direct knowledge of the us 
negotiating position but agreed that a phase out is probable 
because of the decreased soviet threat in asia and philippine 
sovereignty concerns 
a gradual phase out is a likely conclusion at this point 
leach said 
the washington post citing congressional and administration 
sources reported friday that the united states will seek a phase 
out of the bases in the manila talks 
if us negotiators seek a definite end to the bases agreement 
it would be a departure from longstanding us assertion that the 
bases are vital to us and regional defense interests the 
administration has said that if the bases are not wanted they will 
go but has never publicly suggested it would propose a withdrawal 
us officials have long said the bases are critical to defense 
strategies in the pacific and elsewhere and have never publicly 
suggested they would negotiate even a longterm withdrawal 
a phase out would open the way for a commercial agreement under 
which the us military might rent portions of the facilities if 
both sides feel a us presence is needed into the next century 
said solarz 
richard armitage former assistant defense secretary who heads 
the us negotiating team was en route to manila for the talks 
but us officials would not say exactly when he would arrive or 
when the negotiations will begin philippine officials have said 
they will start monday 
recent bombings in manila and threats against americans have 
prompted the us reluctance to give details about arrangements for 
the talks 
previous negotiations have focused primarily on the amount of 
aid the us government gives in connection with the bases 
filipino negotiators have reportedly asked for 1 billion a year 
and more 
the reagan administration pledged 962 million over two years to 
keep the bases until september 1991 but congress cut 96 million 
from the request

supreme court nominee david h souter said 
friday he had not made up his mind about how he would vote as a 
justice if the court were asked to overturn its 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion 
while refusing repeatedly to give his own views on abortion 
souter told the senate judiciary committee during the second day of 
his confirmation hearings 
i have not got any agenda on what should be done with roe vs 
wade the 1973 ruling i would listen to both sides of that case 
i have not made up my mind and i would not go on the court saying i 
must go one way or i must go the other way 
abortion foes have high hopes that president bushs nominee to 
replace liberal justice william j brennan will provide the 
critical vote to overturn the decision 
abortionrights groups have expressed fears that that might 
indeed happen and planned parenthood and the national abortion 
rights action league announced their opposition friday to souters 
nomination 
the days most dramatic moment came when sen edward kennedy 
dmass pressed souter to explain his role as new hampshires 
attorney general in defending the states literacy requirement for 
voters 
after kennedy recited a quote attributed to souter that the 
votes of illiterates dilute the votes of those people who can 
read souter responded that is kind of a statement of math 
suggesting that souters response was callous kennedy said 
thats something that i find is troublesome 
earlier kennedy had asked souter whether he believed abortion 
is moral souter refused to answer but said his view on abortions 
morality will play absolutely no role in his deciding any 
abortion case that would come before him 
souter again refused to give his personal view after kennedy 
noted that sandra day oconnor responded to that question 
judge during the confirmation hearings that preceded her joining 
the supreme court in 1981 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel also expressed 
frustration over his inability to draw souter out on abortion 
no one here is seeking a commitment on anything biden said 
also on abortion souter told the committee he had voted to let 
such operations be performed at a hospital where he served on the 
board of trustees but he said his vote did not necessarily reflect 
his moral views on abortion 
on another topic souter told the senators that as a judge he 
might go against some of the stands he took as new hampshires 
attorney general in freedomofreligion cases 
but he defended his prosecution of demonstrators who opposed the 
building of the seabrook nuclear reactor in new hampshire 
meanwhile president bush touted his nominee at a news 
conference and at a white house meeting with an international 
gathering of judges 
bush said he had watched portions of the hearings on television 
and he called his nominees effort magnificent masterful 
souter will return for more questioning on monday 
he was asked by sen gordon humphrey rnh about his vote to 
allow abortions while on the concord hospitals board in the 
mid1970s the nominee noted that legalized abortion was the law 
of the land after the 1973 supreme court decision in roe vs 
wade 
while indicating that some trustees might have had moral 
scruples against abortion he said we did not believe it was 
appropriate to impose those views on the hospital 
souter attempted to distance himself from his involvement as 
state attorney general in two freedomofreligion controversies of 
the 1970s 
in one he defended gov meldrim thomsons order that flags on 
all state government buildings be flown at half staff on good 
friday to commemorate jesus christs death 
in the other he prosecuted two jehovahs witnesses for covering 
the state motto live free or die on theirautomobile license 
plates 
noting that the flaglowering order was struck down by a federal 
judge in boston souter said if i were sitting as a judge today 
i probably would have ruled the same way as did the judge in that 
case 
and he conceded that new hampshires interest in the license tag 
case was not particularly compelling 
an interesting exchange occurred when sen charles grassley 
riowa complained about activist judges and asked souter about 
rights created by the courts 
the supreme court should only act and can only act when it 
has the judicial responsibility under the constitution but the 
supreme court is left to act alone when the political branches do 
not act beforehand souter said 
citing the 1954 high court decision that outlawed racial 
segregation in americas public schools he said we had brown 
vs board of education because we had no decision from any 
other branch of the government at any other level of the 
government facing the undoubted constitutional problem that had to 
be solved 
souter said congress willingness to aggressively protect the 
constitutions promise of equal protection of the law for all is 
welcome so the court is not left in the position of seeming to be 
the only guarantor of some of the very liberties that we must most 
be concerned with 
he added judges are not the only people in our governmental 
structure who are sworn to uphold the constitution and to try to 
make it work the executive the president of the united states 
takes such an oath all of you take such an oath you are just 
as much responsible for making good on the constitutions 
guarantees as we are in the judiciary 
on another topic souter said he may have been quoted out of 
context when in a speech he reportedly used the phrase 
affirmative discrimination to describe affirmative action 
it goes without saying that when we consider the powers of the 
judiciary to remedy discrimination that has gone before souter 
told sen paul simon dill the appropriate response is not to 
say stop doing it the appropriate response is to say undo 
it 
souter who spent seven years on the new hampshire supreme court 
before being named a federal appeals court judge by bush last 
april would become the supreme courts 105th justice if confirmed 
the judiciary committee will vote on souters nomination after 
completing its hearings sometime next week the nomination then 
will go to the full senate

a 4yearold girl received an intravenous 
injection friday and made history by becoming the first patient to 
receive gene therapy 
the patient is doing beautifully said dr french anderson 
a scientist at the national heart lung and blood institute 
the family now has new hope for their child said another 
researcher dr kenneth w culver of the national cancer 
institutes 
during the 28minute infusion procedure the girl who was not 
identified sat up in her bed played and put stickers on the lab 
coats of her doctors 
im sure this will be one of the most closely watched human 
beings on the face of the earth today said don ralbovsky a 
spokesman for the national institutes of health in bethesda md 
where the procedure was conducted 
the therapy involves inserting curative genes into human cells 
its first therapeutic use was given final approval only hours 
before by the food and drug administration 
this is a small but crucial step to treating a whole array of 
genetic diseases said dr r michael blaese another cancer 
institute researcher on the project 
success could lead to use of the procedure against cancer 
hemophilia sickle cell anemia aids and other diseases in years to 
come 
the child suffers from a rare genetic disease called ada 
deficiency which weakens her immune system so that it cannot fight 
infection and disease 
about 1 billion cells approximately a small thimbleful were 
mixed in a saline solution in the first infusion which took about 
a half hour 
anderson said he would not expect to see results for the first 
several months but that within a year they should know whether the 
treatment is working 
the national institutes of health has approval to treat up to 10 
patients with ada deficiency the afflicted children were born with 
a gene that does not produce the enzyme adenosine deaminase or 
ada which is essential for an immune system to function normally 
this leaves them vulnerable to infections and diseases most people 
can fight off 
the best of the current treatments for the 10 children born in 
north america each year suffering from the disease is a bone 
marrow transplant with a donor whose tissue type matches the 
childs but most of the children dont have a matched donor and 
success with an unmatched donor is about 50 percent 
untreated children with the disease die within the first two 
years of life they usually dont live into their second decade 
even with current treatments 
weeks ago researchers took white cells from some of the 
4yearolds blood and began growing them in tissue culture then 
they inserted a normal ada gene into these cells with a genetically 
engineered virus the virus has been disabled and is no longer 
infectious but is a vehicle to get the normal gene into the cells 
where it produces the required enzyme 
once enough adacorrected cells have been grown they are 
infused into the patient intravenously 
the treatments will be given once a month for about two years 
the experiment first proposed by nih in april 1987 was 
recommended for approval by an advisory committee july 31 and was 
approved by nih last week 
another genetherapy experiment also approved by nih last week 
and awaiting fda clearance would treat patients with a lethal form 
of skin cancer

gov michael s dukakis closed the book on the 
massachusetts mutiny on friday when he returned from a european 
trade mission and ended lt gov evelyn murphys brief reign as 
acting governor 
there was some consolation for murphy in the aftermath of an 
episode that sunk her foundering race for governor an aide said 
dukakis would consider adopting some elements of her plan to 
restructure the states frail budget 
dukakis said he planned to meet saturday with assistants to 
discuss the state budget which already is running at a deficit two 
months into the fiscal year he refused to say what action he would 
take on murphys plans 
just a week earlier dukakis left massachusetts under a cloud of 
rebellion with murphy pledging to seize control of the states 
finances in his absence 
murphy who was seeking the democratic nomination for governor 
unveiled her budget plans sept 7 but she could not escape charges 
that her tactics were designed to bolster her failing campaign 
murphy dropped out of the governors race monday she said se 
would continue to fight for her plans contained in executive 
orders she signed last week 
dukakis whose popularity has plummeted along with his states 
economy decided not to run for reelection this year 
economic woes were on his mind when he returned from europe i 
will take advice from anybody and everybody who can constructively 
participate in this that includes the lieutenant governor he 
said at a news conference at logan international airport 
murphy said her plans would save the state about 150 million 
annually she called for slashing about 1000 jobs from the state 
workforce and issuing monthly budget reports detailing spending and 
revenues 
administration officials said they have been complying with the 
orders but also indicated murphys plans fit within budgetcutting 
measures issued by dukakis before he left to help offset shrinking 
tax collections 
s stephen rosenfeld dukakis chief of staff indicated that 
parts of murphys orders may be included in the final budget cuts 
he said the eventual payroll cuts will go well beyond the 
reductions ordered by murphy although he could not specify where 
these cuts would occur 
rosenfeld said he did not expect murphy would attend saturdays 
budget session with the governor jodi durso a spokeswoman for 
the lieutenant governor said murphy was not invited

californias first planned toll roads 
were announced friday marking the first time that freewayhappy 
motorists will face levies on anything but bridges 
the roads all privately financed under a new stateapproved 
program include a 12 billion 40mile highway east of san 
francisco and a 10mile segment in san diego county near the 
mexican border two other projects were approved for orange county 
just south of los angeles 
all are set for completion by 1997 
gov george deukmejian also said two backup plans were approved 
in case financing or other problems blocked the toll roads one 
would replace san franciscos earthquakedamaged embarcadero 
freeway with an underground highway and the other would construct 
a highspeed train from the los angeles international airport to 
palmdale in the mohave desert 
while privitizing roads is not new in the country 
californias approach is unique because the private sector 
selects the projects from among those already on a list of planned 
future state highways deukmejian said 
the toll roads would all be constructed with private funds with 
the state and developers negotiating the tolls before construction 
begins bob best the director of the state department of 
transportation told a news conference that he expected tolls to 
run between 10 and 20 cents per mile 
the toll roads program was part of the political compromise that 
led to the 9centspergallon gasoline tax increase approved by 
california voters in june 
the planned toll roads would be 
in orange county an 11mile road roughly between anaheim 
stadium and the john wayne airport and 10 miles of new toll lanes 
on the route 91 freeway to riverside county 
in san diego county a new fourlane freeway extending 10 miles 
from the otay mesa road near the mexican border north to state 
route 54 at an estimated cost of 400 million 
in contra costa county east of san francisco a five or 
sixlane 40mile road between antioch and interstate 680 near

authorities are investigating the 
cargo of an impounded iraqibound ship suspected earlier of 
carrying parts for a supergun that could fire chemical 
warheads a prosecutors spokeswoman said friday 
the spokeswoman also said iraqi authorities failed in an effort 
to free the ship when a dutch court refused to hear a lawsuit they 
had filed 
the bahamianregistered gur mariner was seized in the dutch 
north sea port of vlissingen on thursday after customs received a 
document identifying the destination of its cargo as iraq 
according to dutch radio the ship was carrying pipe segments 
for use in oil drilling operations as well as machine parts and 
unidentified chemicals 
in april british customs seized a consignment of iraqibound 
pipe segments that were on a dock waiting to be picked up by the 
gur mariner 
the pipes were believed parts for a 120footlong artillery 
piece supposedly being built that would be capable of lobbying 
shells from iraqi territory hundreds of miles into israel 
alleged components for the socalled supergun believed to be 
capable of carrying chemical weapons have since surfaced in 
several other european nations 
josine mooijen of the rotterdam prosecutors office which is 
investigating the case told the associated press the ships papers 
state its cargo in rather vague terms she said the cargo was 
being investigated but refused to provide details 
according to the radio report the gur mariner had picked up 
cargo in bremen west germany and middlesborough britain where 
the piping was seized in april 
the report said the gur mariner was in the egyptian suez canal 
port of port said when the united nations declared its trade 
embargo against iraq the ship then returned to rotterdam said the 
report 
it added that a us navy detachment in the mediterranean sea 
had tried to chase the ship because of suspicions it sought to 
break the un embargo imposed after iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
the case came to light on thursday when papers submitted to 
dutch customs gave the cargos destination as iraq investigators 
seized the ship under dutch laws enforcing the un embargo on 
iraq 
the prosecutors spokeswoman also said the iraqi government lost

house and senate negotiators gave formal 
approval friday to a compromise provision of the clean air bill 
that would require factories and businesses to tighen controls on 
smogcausing pollutants 
the provisions had tentatively been approved in negotiations 
among staff members earlier in the week and had expected to be 
endorsed by the house and senate members 
the industrial smog measure is part of a much broader clean air 
bill that would impose tough new pollution controls on electric 
utilities automobiles and factories including reductions in 
sulfer dioxide and the industrial release of toxic chemicals 
the agreement would require even small emitters of smogcausing 
pollution like dry cleaners bakeries and furniture makers to 
comply with tougher controls by installing new pollution control 
equipment 
the senate had exempted polluters releasing less than 100 tons 
of pollution a year but the house version which was adopted by 
the conferees requires compliance by polluters of as little as 25 
to 50 tons a year in cities with serious smog problems 
after the industrial smog section was approved conferees agreed 
to proceed to a section of the massive bill that deals with new 
pollution controls on motor vehicles 
both the house and senate approved clean air bills earlier this 
year but the negotiations are aimed at resolving an array of 
differences including how much to toughen the pollution controls on 
cars buses and trucks 
the legislation would be the first strengthening of federal air 
pollution controls in 13 years

president joaquin 
balaguer said friday that dominicans must go to the beach less 
to survive a gasoline shortage and economic crunch from the faceoff 
in the persian gulf 
in another effort to solve the countrys economic problems a 
top central bank official flew to washington for talks with the 
international monetary fund although there is no current agreement 
with the imf the government last month imposed unpopular austerity 
measures recommended by the fund 
the aug 13 measures devalued the dominican peso and increased 
prices for food and gasoline touching off protests and strikes 
that left 12 people dead and 50 wounded in clashes with police 
on friday balaguer said dominicans must tighten their belts 
to live with the recent measures and fight 70 percent inflation 
afflicting this caribbean nation of 67 million people 
weve got to tighten our belts and think about our country 
balaguer said we have to use less gas go out less go to the 
beach less we must appeal to dominican patriotism so that we can 
overcome this crisis 
luis toral governor of the central bank was to meet with imf 
officials next week in washington but the country was not expected 
to sign an agreement immediately 
the dominican republic is in arrears on most of its 4 billion 
foreign debt because it cannot make the payments economists say 
without an imf accord it cannot get new loans or credits to 
reschedule the debt 
balaguer said two weeks ago he would not sign an accord that 
imposes obligations which we cannot meet the last imf accord 
in 1984 led to protests that left 100 dead in three days of 
rioting 
on thursday the government imposed another gasoline price 
increase from about 89 cents a gallon to 142 it also announced 
30 to 40 percent cuts in oil imports 
balaguer said he had no alternative because of the oil crisis 
caused by iraqs invasion of kuwait the country has no other 
choice but to pay for petroleum at the current prices or reduce its 
consumption balaguer said friday

the senate cleared the way friday for action 
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase 
fuel economy 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hoped 
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require 
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles 
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into 
effect but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure 
on the senate floor 
within hours of the vote transportation secretary samuel 
skinner blasted the legislation as unrealistic irresponsible 
and more important unattainable he said theres no technology 
to achieve the bills goals without making cars smaller 
it should be called the highway fatality bill skinner said 
at a news conference citing a new study by the national highway 
traffic safety administration that concluded a clear link between 
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths 
the nhtsa study said the introduction of smaller cars over the 
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1340 additional traffic 
deaths annually in singlecar accidents based on those numbers 
nhtsa administrator jerry curry said between 600 and 1140 
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to 
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard 
skinner said automakers had convinced him that the senate bills 
fuel economy goals cant be achieved without substantial weight 
reductions in cars 
joan claybrook a former nhtsa administrator in the carter 
adminstration and now president of public citizen a consumer 
group disputed claims that cars necessarily will have to be made 
smaller to burn less fuel 
she cited a transportation department research vehicle built in 
the 1970s that achieved 43 mpg despite providing improved 
protection to occupants than conventional cars 
weve just had the first inning of this nineinning game 
sen donald riegle dmich said after the senate voted 6828 to 
clear the way for debate 
we hope and intend to win this fight riegle said adding 
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off 
debate and bring it to a vote next week 
a similar bill has been introduced in the house but it has yet 
to be taken up by the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich is staunchly opposed to the 
measure 
rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of the house bill said 
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on 
the house floor in an effort to bypass dingells committee 
but the senates 6828 vote friday to cut off efforts by riegle 
to keep the measure off the senate floor was an indication of the 
growing support in congress for a measure to reduce us reliance 
on foreign oil a subject in the spotlight since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
its the single most important step to reducing our dependency 
on opec oil and curbing global warming the sierra club said of 
the bill sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev 
in floor debate riegle said those fuel savings arent likely to 
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to todays oil 
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an 
hour 
later a riegle aide said the senator didnt necessarily support 
a change in the speed limit 
bryan described his bill as a message to detroit and the 
automakers that theyre going to have to look at fuel economy and 
not just muscle cars 
it does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we dont 
start conserving now some future president may have to consider 
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the middle 
east he said

the central soviet government intends to 
completely cut off oil shipments to poland next year and recommends 
that officials seek supplies from individual republics a polish 
official was quoted as saying 
polish officials who are also contending with the loss of about 
1 million tons of iraqi oil because of the un embargo have been 
looking for new supply sources 
instead of the 13 million tons of oil which poland has been 
getting annually the supplies proposed for 1991 will amount to 
zero said government minister jerzy osiatynski head of the 
central planning office of the solidarityled government he was 
quoted in a statement carried late thursday by the pap news agency 
he said polish negotiators heard the news during talks held aug 
2831 by delegations of the two countries 
the soviet side suggested that in order to get any oil 
supplies poland should establish direct contact and cooperation 
with the republics and distributors interested in this said 
osiatynski in the statement 
he said polish officials followed the advice immediately but 
gave no indication whether poland had succeeded in finding sellers 
poland has traditionally relied on the soviet union for lowcost 
oil for almost all its needs in 1991 for the first time soviet 
and polish trade was to have been conducted on a hardcurrency 
basis with poland paying market prices for oil 
foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski asked about the 
reported cutoff at a news conference friday said negotiations 
continue but we cannot be too optimistic about substantial 
supplies 
in addition to oil cutbacks the soviet negotiators also said 
that supplies of natural gas sold to poland will be reduced from 
this years level of more than 82 billion cubic meters to 52 
billion cubic meters 
deliveries of soviet oil to poland so far this year have been 
running up to 50 percent behind schedule the government has said 
gasoline prices were increased by an average of 30 percent on 
sept 1 to curb demand and cover the added cost of supplies

hundreds of couples said i do before 
a court clerk who should have said i cant 
the clerk was not legally sworn in to administer marriages but 
the weddings are legally binding anyway attorney general joseph 
curran said 
i want to reassure any couple that may have been married in 
howard county by the employee that the marriage is valid curran 
said 
circuit court clerk c merritt pumphrey said he deputized two of 
the three clerks who perform most of the ceremonies but did not 
administer the oath to laura pannebecker 
i just chose not to pumphrey said 
pumphrey said he thought he didnt need to formally deputize 
pannebecker who has conducted hundreds of weddings in the last 
four years because she was authorized by an administrative judge 
to become a deputy clerk 
assistant attorney general julia freit said that maryland law 
clearly states that only deputized employees can perform weddings 
i highly recommended that pannebecker absolutely perform no 
further marriages she said thursday adding that pumphrey has 
been notified that employees conducting marriages must be formally 
sworn in for each fouryear administrative term 
pumphrey said friday he has not decided whether to deputize 
pannebecker she was on vacation and could not be reached for 
comment friday 
couples were assured that their marriages will not be 
questioned some were mollified 
i only live a few minutes away and i dont mind going back and 
doing it again said mark cochran 29 who was married in june 
but in my mind i was married on that day 
others in this baltimore suburb remained angry 
if we have to do it again it should be on howard countys 
bill said jill huston 30 who was married in january 
curran said a 1925 maryland court of appeals ruling would 
validate the marriages 
the high court ruled that a couples marriage was legal although 
the minister lacked authority from his church to conduct wedding 
ceremonies concluding the union was valid because the couple 
believed the minister was qualified 
it logically follows that the court would reach the same 
conclusion with respect to a marriage performed by a supposed 
public official curran said

switzerland 
rabhan arrived in atlanta on friday but he was whisked away for 
a private meeting with carter who has worked for years for his 
freedom 
i look forward to being reunited with a friend carter told 
the atlanta journal hes really an extraordinary person im 
very proud of david 
rabhans mother frances reached in savannah praised carter 
for his efforts to win her sons release 
im not going to let him talk to you though im going to 
keep him to myself mrs rabhan said in a telephone interview 
president carter has been like another son to me you cant have 
a better friend

that iranian authorities had agreed sept 3 to allow rabhan to 
leave the country he was reportedly released from irans evin 
prison on aug 6 and issued an exit visa thursday hours before

contact with iran would not confirm the inquirers report which 
said swiss authorities looked after rabhans interests and 
guaranteed he would not flee before being given a visa to leave 
iran

rabhans relationship with carter dates to at least 1970 when 
rabhan volunteered his services as a pilot during carters second 
campaign for governor of georgia

hostage but neither the reagan nor bush administrations 
considered him a hostage and his plight went largely unreported 
mrs rabhan objected to calling her son a hostage 
he was a prisoner but he was not a hostage she said 
nothing was offered for him and that made it harder to win his 
release 
according to letters he managed to get out of iran rabhan was 
physically abused and his weight once fell by 44 pounds he spent 
part of his imprisonment in solitary confinement in a windowless 
cell the letters said 
his physical condition is good said ms jacobson who said

angry republican budget negotiators accused 
democrats on friday of giving reporters details of privately 
offered gop tax proposals and said the disclosures were threatening 
deficitreduction talks 
we are trying to do a difficult job in cooperation with our 
democratic colleagues senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
said on the senate floor it is not going to work if this garbage 
keeps piling up day after day 
dole spoke as bargainers began their second week of confidential 
talks at andrews air force base in maryland just outside 
washington they spent much of fridays session complaining about 
the leaks said one official who asked to not be identified 
the mood was basically illwill the official said 
after a spurt of movement earlier in the week toward a package 
saving 50 billion next year and 500 billion through 1995 
progress has slowed 
up and down like a roller coaster was how president bush 
described the talks 
republican leaders angrily took to the senate floor friday after 
some reporters obtained copies of analyses of tax proposals 
democrats and republicans have made at the negotiations 
the associated press received the data from sources who demanded 
anonymity 
the studies performed by congress nonpartisan joint tax 
committee showed that gop tax proposals would raise taxes by 41 
billion on people who earn 50000 a year or less they would cut 
taxes by 11 billion on those with higher incomes 
the analysis said the proportionately largest tax increase 26 
percent would go to people who earn less than 10000 annually 
the biggest tax cut 55 percent would go to those who earn 
200000 or more a year 
the democratic plan would cut taxes by 4 billion for people 
earning 20000 or less annually and boost them by 268 billion 
by anyone else the study said people with incomes surpassing 
200000 yearly would shoulder the greatest burden a 67 percent 
tax boost 
republicans complained that the disclosures of confidential 
proposals are designed to make the gop look bad 
there is a deliberate effort by some on the other side to 
cast this as republicans for the rich and they are for everybody 
else dole said i am not certain we ought to continue to 
negotiate on this basis 
gop lawmakers also warned that the leaks could make it harder 
for a budgetcutting plan to be crafted 
we have to make some tough choices and so occasionally 
somebody puts a very tough proposition on the table said sen 
pete domenici rnm thats courage but there wont be much 
courage out there if the next day that tough proposition is all 
over the country 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine condemned the 
leaks but added the leaks have not all been one way 
one of the biggest remaining disputes is over the bush plan to 
slash the capital gains tax rate 
the president wants to drop the maximum tax rate on sales of 
property from 33 percent to 15 percent a move he says will 
increase government revenues by encouraging transactions democrats 
say the idea is a moneyloser whose main beneficiaries would be the 
wealthy and are demanding higher income tax rates on the rich in 
return 
the republicans have proposed a pennyagallon tax on all 
petroleum products except feedstock and limiting the deductibility 
of state and local income taxes to 10000 
democrats have suggested an 11centpergallon gasoline tax 
increase and a 4 percent tax on other forms of energy above its 
current level of 9 cents 
both sides have offered to tax luxury items such as expensive 
cars and to increase alcohol and tobacco levies 
the negotiators planned to take saturday off and return to work 
sunday

ousted police chief mack vines pleaded innocent to 
perjury friday telling reporters the charge was the result of a 
misunderstanding 
vines who was fired after his indictment wednesday said he 
hopes to remain in law enforcement somewhere in the dallas area 
district judge joe kendall said he would move the trial from 
dallas because of publicity he allowed vines to remain free on his 
own recognizance 
frankly chief i dont believe that you can get a fair trial 
in this town kendall said 
vines is accused of lying to a panel that investigated the 
firing of a police officer who shot an unarmed mexican man to death 
last year an administrative judge ordered the officer patrick 
lemaire reinstated this summer but lemaire did not return to the 
dallas force 
the misdemeanor perjury charge alleges that vines lied to the 
panel about a conversation he had with his assistant greg 
holliday on aug 2 
holliday said vines called him the night before he was scheduled 
to appear before the panel and tried to influence his testimony 
vines told the panel he had not discussed testimony before the 
panel with anyone 
holliday told city manager jan hart about the conversation and 
she suspended both men with pay holliday later was reinstated 
vines said he was taken aback by his firing since he thought 
the police department was making progress in community relations 
under his leadership he had been police chief for two years 
i felt that we were going along well and mending bridges and 
building new bridges he said

two leftist palestinian guerrilla leaders 
arrived in the capital friday on their first official visit in 20 
years to attend a conference expected to produce a declaration of 
support for iraq 
their arrival marks a major shift in jordans ties with radical 
palestinian factions which had been banned for two decades in this 
moderate kingdom 
one of the leaders george habash heads the popular front for 
the liberation of palestine the secondlargest faction in the 
palestine liberation organization he was in jordan briefly last 
week on his way to iraq but did not meet with any officials 
the other nayef hawatmeh heads the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine that faction ranks third after habashs 
and fatah the mainstream group headed by plo chairman yasser 
arafat 
hawatmeh drove in friday from damascus syria and habash flew 
in from baghdad iraq 
they were to attend this weekends conference of leftist 
organizations from throughout the arab world a plo official said 
the conference is expected to result in a declaration of support 
for iraqi president saddam hussein in his confrontation with 
usled forces in the persian gulf 
hawatmeh will spend a few days in jordan before traveling to 
neighboring iraq the plo official said without being more 
specific 
palestinian sources have said habash who spent nearly two weeks 
in iraq has moved his headquarters to baghdad after a fallingout 
with his former syrian backers 
syria iraqs archrival has committed thousands of troops to 
the usled buildup against iraq jordan has refused to provide 
soldiers and tried to settle the crisis with diplomacy 
it is not clear if hawatmeh who had been cautious not to commit 
himself either way on the gulf issue also has important 
differences with syria 
his criticism of saddam after the annexation of kuwait had led 
to a mutiny in his ranks by members who demanded unequivocal 
support of iraq in line with the plo mainstream 
during their stay in jordan the two marxist leaders will confer 
with king hussein and other jordanian and palestinian leaders 
hawatmeh 57 and habash 64 had not visited jordan since the 
1970 clashes between husseins bedouin army and the guerrillas one 
of the main causes of the showdown widely known as black 
september was the hijacking of three airliners by habashs 
guerrillas 
although they are radicals the two guerrilla leaders have been 
committed to arafats policies to renounce terrorism and recognize 
israels right to exist that put them more in harmony with 
jordans stand on the arabisraeli conflict 
in addition the refusal of jordan to join in the military 
buildup against iraq has bolstered jordanian relations with the 
plo 
more than half of jordans 31 million people come from 
palestinian families they fled their homeland after creation of 
the jewish state in 1948 and the 1967 israeli occupation of west 
bank and gaza strip

lebanons leading shiite moslem cleric on a plan for swapping 
anglican church envoy terry waite for a shiite cleric held by 
israel a magazine reported friday

ambassador david thathem and mohammed hussein fadlallah and focused 
on details of releasing the british hostage terry waite in return 
for the release of sheik abdul karim obeid 
the story was not attributed to any source 
alshiraa received international attention for breaking the 
story of secret us arms sales to iran in 1986 in return for the 
release of american hostages 
its recent reports on western captives held mainly by 
proiranian factions in lebanon have not been accurate 
fadlallah the reputed mentor of the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god called the magazine report a lie 
the british embassy in lebanon could not be reached for comment 
in london a foreign office spokesman said i dont even know 
whether the ambassador did meet him its possible the ambassador 
is engaged on a whole series of calls there he doesnt report 
them all it sounds like pure speculation to me 
the magazine said the british ambassador asked fadlallah to 
give him time to consult the british government on the offer 
thathem was given 10 days to come back with the british reply it 
gave no other details 
helicopterborne israeli troops kidnapped obeid a hezbollah 
cleric from his southern lebanon village of jibsheet in 1989

runcie disappeared on jan 20 1987 after leaving his west beirut

iraqi troops raided the diplomatic compounds of 
france canada and belgium in kuwait on friday briefly detaining 
five western consuls capturing four french citizens and provoking 
calls for retaliation 
one of the four frances military attache was freed after 
several hours french president francois mitterrand called an 
emergency cabinet meeting for saturday saying the raid is an 
aggression and we will respond to it 
we will have to decide and show very clearly our 
obligations mitterrand said 
iraqs official news agency denied iraqi soldiers stormed the 
compounds which it referred to as former diplomatic missions in 
the province of kuwait since invading and annexing kuwait in 
august iraq has referred to it as an iraqi province 
iraqs ambassador to france abdul razzak al hachimi accused 
the french in a television interview of seeking a pretext to 
escalate tensions 
daniel bernard spokesman for the french foreign ministry 
responded to the iraqi comments it would suffice to see the 
state of the ambassadors residence which was completely sacked 
and pillaged by iraqi soldiers 
there was no word on the fate of the three french civilians 
seized with the attache col edouard crespin they had been hiding 
in the embassy compound to avoid being taken hostage 
the canadian embassy in paris said special iraqi forces entered 
the ambassadors residence which is part of the compound before 
dawn the consul was briefly detained but later released along 
with consuls from the united states ireland britain and 
australia according to a canadian diplomat in washington 
the consuls had been meeting to discuss the evacuation of 
additional westerners from kuwait said the diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
belgian officials said three iraqi soldiers entered belgiums 
diplomatic compound and ordered the two remaining diplomats to 
leave the embassy the soldiers left after the diplomats fled into 
the ambassadors adjacent residence 
the belgian foreign ministry said the intrusion was an 
unacceptable act going against all international laws 
the netherlands disclosed that iraqi troops had forced their way 
into its ambassadors residence in kuwait earlier this week it 
said iraqs ambassador was summoned to hear a sharp protest 
france vigorously protested the iraqi action and the european 
community called it intolerable french political leaders 
demanded retaliation and some called for an emergency session of 
the un security council 
no specific moves were discussed but there was speculation a 
response could entail the iraqi embassy in paris which is still 
operating normally 
nato chief manfred woerner on an official visit to poland 
called the incursion into the french compound another outrageous 
violation of international law 
in brussels the european community called on iraq to release 
the french citizens and respect the 1961 vienna convention on the 
inviolability of diplomatic missions 
after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and later annexed the 
oilrich nation baghdad ordered embassies in kuwait closed saying 
the nation was part of iraq territory iraqi troops surrounded the 
missions and power and water were cut to many in an effort to 
force their closure but 17 embassies have defied the iraqi order 
american and british officials denied rumors their embassies had 
also been attacked 
we have been in contact with the embassy and reports that 
troops overran the embassy are not true said a state department 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity the situation 
hasnt changed since yesterday water and electricity are cut off 
but they have supplies 
the staffs of more than 30 other foreign missions have left 
since the aug 24 deadline but some of the countries insist their 
embassies technically remain open 
the french foreign ministry said troops entered the residence of 
the french ambassador about 7 am friday taking crespin and three 
others to an undisclosed location 
iraqi authorities had earlier cut off water and electricity to 
the french embassy in kuwait and at one point knocked down part of 
its wall the ambassadors residence and the embassy are separate 
buildings 
the french ambassador has been out of kuwait since the invasion 
and a halfdozen diplomats continue to staff the french embassy 
headed by the charge daffaires jeanpierre galtier 
this is a very serious violation of the vienna convention a 
french foreign ministry spokesman said this is a new intolerable 
attack to international rights and the integrity of the person 
the persian gulf crisis reversed 15 years of close ties between 
iraq and france which had been baghdads top western arms supplier 
and a major trading partner 
since the crisis began france has sent the secondlargest naval 
force to the region after the united states to help enforce un 
sanctions against iraq 
france has an estimated 400 citizens remaining in iraq and 
kuwait

democrat hugh parmer is out to turn sen phil 
gramms washington experience against him depicting the gop 
senator as part of the problem on issues ranging from the budget to 
the savings and loan mess 
there is a general discontent with incumbents among voters 
says parmer the campaign challenger who trails gramm in both 
public opinion polls and fund raising i dont think the people 
much like the results of whats gone on in washington for the last 
few years 
parmer a 51yearold state senator who is a fort worth attorney 
and the citys former mayor maintains gramm is a conservative 
extremist who has lost touch with the values of texans 
sen gramms media campaign in which he basically identified 
himself as one of the important movers and shakers in washington in 
recent years was a doubleedged sword parmer said it has 
potential to damage him given the hostility to the guys that are 
in 
they cant get the budget fixed they cant get the savings 
and loan problem fixed they cant get the trade problem fixed 
but parmers approach runs the risk of drawing favorable 
attention to gramms leadership role in congress 
while budget deficits have ballooned gramms name is affixed to 
the key law aimed at alleviating the problem grammrudman it 
mandates spending cuts if deficit targets arent met 
gramm a 48yearold former economics professor said his role 
in the national debate on issues such as the budget and trade 
matters is what the voters expect from him 
texans expect the man who sits in sam houstons seat to be a 
national leader gramm said in an interview but they also 
expct him to represent the state to get things done for texas 
and to come back home and listen to their views 
he touts his support for a strong military research and high 
technology programs and investments that advance the longterm 
future of the country 
but parmer says gramm neglects programs for education health 
care and aid to the elderly 
gramm bolted from the democratic party in 1983 resigning his 
us house seat he was reelected to congress within a month 
becoming the first republican to represent the central texas 
district 
although widely disparaged by texas democratic hierarchy gramm 
is one of the states most popular politicians and is heavily 
favored for reelection 
gramms campaign has raised nearly 14 million more money than 
any other us senator seeking reelection and he has kept a 
blistering schedule of appearances raising the gops profile in 
traditionally democratic texas 
he said hes not just looking to win reelection but to win 
with 60 percent of the vote pulling in votes for other republicans 
further down the texas ballot 
parmer meanwhile has raised more than 15 million among the 
highest totals of any senate challenger and is attacking on a wide 
array of issues 
parmers tv ads point out gramms opposition to federal funding 
of abortions the senator has sponsored five constitutional 
amendments to ban abortion but now supports the texas gops 
legislative plan that would allow pregnant women to obtain 
abortions before the fetus is 20 weeks old 
parmer says the government should leave the abortion decision up 
to women 
neither candidate is invulnerable on the savings and loan issue 
but both are pointing fingers 
as a congressman in 1980 gramm voted to raise deposit insurance 
and remove geographical lending restrictions 
parmer was in the texas senate that deregulated state 
institutions in a 1983 voice vote 
gramm accepted 86098 from thriftrelated interests during the 
1980s the sixthhighest total in the senate and fourthhighest for 
a member of the senate banking committee a study of campaign 
contributions by common cause found 
but gramm says that 90 cents out of every dollar of sampl losses 
were not in federally chartered sampls but were in statechartered 
sampls 
the great bulk of the problem was under his parmers 
jurisdiction gramm said

art lovers with a fertile imagination will have 
a rich field to till as they stroll through sculptor joel shapiros 
exhibit at the baltimore museum of art 
most of the 25 works are made of simple blocks of wood or 
bronze and suggest human or other figures in a wide array of 
activity and emotion 
his ability to create these impressions is what makes the 
exhibit joel shapiro tracing the figure a success said 
brenda richardson the museums curator of painting and sculpture 
joel is more accessible its easier for us to get close to 
his work said richardson who collaborated with the artist in 
designing the exhibit 
the exhibit opened in august and runs through oct 7 at the 
baltimore museum of art after which it will travel to the des 
moines art center and the center for fine arts in miami 
very often when people see a minimalist exhibit they feel 
hostile shut out many people feel very remote from it 
richardson said that is not the response people have to 
shapiro 
shapiro 48 is a new york native who calls himself a 
postminimalist like the minimalists before him he uses the most 
basic of shapes but unlike them he goes beyond pure abstraction 
and provides something more concrete to think about 
i want the work to be loaded with emotion loaded with 
reference but not to the point where its gratuitous he said 
from his summer home and studio in westport ny 
therefore shapiros sculptures have no faces only the simplest 
representations of body parts and no titles still they succeed 
in conveying emotion a tiny man kneeling in supplication joyful 
kicking dancers with flailing arms a walking figure staring at the 
ground apparently lost in thought 
some stimulate the imagination enough to bring several different 
ideas to mind 
at first glance a series of painted wood blocks clearly suggest 
a figure resting on its side with its left foot bent in another 
moment or from another angle the figure disappears and the blocks 
look more like a model of an apartment building 
from one angle a 7foothigh bronze piece might suggest a giant 
bird taking off from another it could be a strutting drum major 
he doesnt put into it either a bird or drum major thats 
precisely what he wants you to do richardson said even as you 
may grasp a figure you may lose that figure especially as you 
walk around it 
shapiro says the images people glean from his sculptures are 
often different from his own ideas in creating them 
he accepts that as the price for displaying art in public 
im open i think im comfortable with peoples response to 
the work as long as they react to it and dont walk away 
shapiros roots offer little on the origins of his art his 
father was a doctor his mother a biochemist 
after college he spent two years in the peace corps in the late 
1960s his experience in another culture helped him get a better 
perspective on his own interests i became an artist because 
thats what i did best i chose sculpture because it was very much 
in the real world and not hanging on a wall 
shapiros work wasnt always as tangible is the work displayed 
in the exhibit before the mid70s he created more inanimate 
objects such as a tiny chair tiny homes coffins or ladders they 
implied the presence of the human form through its absence 
there was a point where i avoided using the figure he said 
then there was a point where i just abandoned that limitation i 
felt that by using figuration i could allow more into the 
work also it had to do with wanting the work to be more so you 
would have an almost oneonone experience with it

alan gersman is a middleaged middleclass 
white man who never dreamed hed need the protections offered by 
federal civil rights laws 
but in 1988 he lost an important computer records storage 
contract and he believes it was because he is jewish 
group health association stored software with gersmans company 
for four years and expressed consistent satisfaction with the 
firms services court records say but the contract was cancelled 
shortly after an egyptian employee prompted by an iranian 
supervisor asked gersman if he were jewish 
it was the first time in my life when i could really identify 
with a black person said gersman 51 coowner of computer 
security international in suburban washington im really not 
used to being discriminated against 
that was only the first shock the next came when a federal 
court threw out a lawsuit he filed against gha the primary reason 
a 1989 supreme court ruling that an important postcivil war civil 
rights statute while it protected against bias in hiring did not 
cover onthejob discrimination 
gersman said he found it hard to believe he had no recourse 
that type of thing is so basic he said i dont know how you 
could have liberty and the pursuit of happiness without it 
gersman now appealing his case is one of the human faces 
behind the civil rights act of 1990 the bill was passed by the 
house and senate and is headed toward an uncertain fate this fall 
at the white house 
the legislation is designed to reverse or supersede several 
restrictive supreme court rulings on discrimination including the 
one that helped thwart gersmans suit the bill would also give 
many more discrimination victims the right to sue for punitive and 
compensatory damages that route currently is open only to victims 
of racial bias 
civil rights advocates have fought passionately for the bill and 
at least one respected member of congress civil rights movement 
veteran john lewis of georgia says he wont campaign for anyone 
who opposed it but commercial interests and conservatives 
including president bush contend the bill could lead to quotas and 
businessbusting damage payments 
compromise has proven elusive through months of negotiations 
but a lastminute agreement is not out of the question bush would 
much rather sign the bill than veto it and risk alienating the 
minority groups he has been trying to court 
while blacks come to mind as the most obvious beneficiaries of 
stronger civil rights laws they certainly would not be the only 
ones for it is incorrect to assume as gersman did that people 
have the option to do whatever they want to do where theyre 
qualified to do the work nobody thinks twice about it 
studies commissioned by an array of civil rights groups document 
job environments that are utterly hostile to women racial 
minorities or certain religious groups they also describe the many 
holes actual and prospective that victims can fall through when 
they try to obtain legal relief along with writings by judges who 
say their hands have been tied by the supreme court 
carol zabkowicz of racine wisc was one victim she endured 
three years of sexual harassment so severe that her doctor ordered 
a twomonth medical leave during her second pregnancy in order to 
ease stressrelated gastrointestinal problems and avert a 
miscarriage 
there were verbal assaults from some male employees they 
called me a variety of names they asked me to do sexual acts 
there were caricatures of myself posted around the warehouse 
either nude graffiti or myself engaged in sexual acts with animals 
or human beings zabkowicz 35 recalled of her employment at a 
west bend appliances distribution warehouse 
a federal judge rejected the companys depiction of the problem 
as a personality clash and said zabkowicz had been the victim of 
sustained malicious and brutal harassment that was 
malevolent and outrageous he also said supervisors were well 
aware of the harassment but did not stop it 
the penalty for all of this amounted to a 2763 check from west 
bend to zabkowicz back pay for her twomonth medical leave there 
was no legal avenue to pursue damages for pain suffering or 
medical and psychiatric bills leaving zabkowicz with what she 
considered a hollow victory 
it just seems outrageous that in 1990 this stuff still goes 
on zabkowicz said punitive and compensatory damages would be 
a strong deterrent to make certain that this does not happen 
gary mason a cooler repairman at a cocacola bottling plant in 
lenexa kan is black and therefore eligible to file for such 
damages under current law but he was unable to pursue them due to 
the new supreme court restrictions on workplace protection 
i was the first black repairman ever hired in the position i 
had in the cooler department recalled mason 35 naturally i 
started experiencing a lot of racial slurs and remarks and jokes i 
was denied promotions reprimanded for things that i didnt do 
from day one it was a bad atmosphere the boss didnt even shake 
my hand 
a federal judge said cocacola officials apparentl said meanwhile 
according to 
mason the harassment continues ive been reprimanded for 
serving on jury duty he said 
both mason and zabkowicz say they would never have gone to court 
if supervisors and company officials had responded to their 
repeated complaints 
these things occur on their premises and they turn their back 
to it thats when people are forced into the position to do 
something about it zabkowicz said thank goodness we do have 
these laws as an avenue to take but to me the laws arent strong 
enough

with members of congress finally working hard to 
achieve budget cuts some of the very people who had urged them to 
do so are having second thoughts 
the very idea of cuts is so politically sensitive and 
economically involved that some of these people speak only in 
whispers but what those whispers convey is that now might not be 
the best time to cut anything but taxes 
events of the past several weeks have conspired to bring about 
this newer attitude events such as higher oil prices additional 
evidence of a decaying economy a squeeze on household budgets and 
a business credit crunch 
the weakening economy now worries some of these people more than 
continued budget overruns in spite of their having made the latter 
the biggest economic issue of the past year 
the latest job figures have added to the concern new job 
creation has fallen abruptly unemployment is up and monthly job 
gains in private industry so far this year have been off nearly 50 
percent from the like period of 1989 
other reports show that the only parts of the economy still 
growing vibrantly are health care and state and local governments 
and each of these presents problems of its own inflation in health 
care and bureaucratic growth in government neither of them 
designed for a healthy economy 
but ask the whisperers is now the time to make cuts in 
government spending or even to hold it down if the private sector 
economy is withering what except government spending is available 
to give it a nudge 
besides it is said no matter what congress or the white house 
or anyone else wants spending isnt likely to come down when 
billions of dollars are being spent on the military action in the 
mideast 
in a announcement called straighttalk conference board 
economist gail fosler states that military and economic 
uncertainties combined with high tax burdens will prevent any 
meaningful action in slashing the deficit 
fosler comments that federal borrowing will surge over the 
next two years regardless of what the administration and congress 
do to bring down the deficit 
those who say congress shouldnt even try to make the effort 
arent declaring their positions nearly as boldly to do so would 
brand some of them as turncoats because all year long they have 
been advocating cuts 
but says one analyst of the economic scene as the 
grammrudman deadline of oct 1 draws near the weakening economy 
threatens to make these budget negotiations an academic 
excercise 
that comment comes from john wright of wright investors 
service who adds that clearly in its current fragile state the 
us economy can scarcely tolerate either higher taxes or 
acrosstheboard spending cuts 
but it can hardly afford higher interest rates either and until 
congress reaches some sort of agreement those rates are likely to 
remain high that much has been indicated by alan greenspan 
chairman of the federal reserve board 
not only does he remain committed to smaller budget deficits 
but he seems equally determined to forestall any drop in interest 
rates until congress reaches an agreement

as one of the senates staunchest 
conservatives for a dozen years orrin hatch might be expected to 
be among lawmakers campaigning to slash federal grants for the 
arts 
but the utah republican who spent two years as a mormon 
missionary is taking a pass 
he shakes his head glumly at moves to curb funding for the 
national endowment for the arts on grounds that some of the money 
has gone to projects tainted by obscenity 
no one is more against obscenity and pornography than i am 
but i just dont believe that the congress should impose censorship 
through the authorization process hatch said 
some of these people if they had lived in the time of 
leonardo da vinci and michelangelo the sistine chapel would never 
have been painted hatch says of lawmakers heading the drive 
they wouldnt allow you to hang a reubens in the senate 
hatch is scrupulously polite and softspoken although sometimes 
an emotional side surfaces unexpectedly 
when the senate debated rights for the disabled in july hatch 
was telling how his brotherinlaw suffered as a victim of polio 
suddenly he just broke down 
i mean i just wept tears rolling down my cheeks hatch 
recalls i was embarrassed because i dont like people to know 
that side of me that much 
from the scourge of the liberals to patron of the arts and other 
issues irksome to conservatives hatchs political persona is 
undergoing a distinct change 
when hatch arrived in the senate in 1977 he was immediately 
accepted as one of the fiercest conservatives to prowl the floor 
over the last two years though hes been at odds with old allies 
more than once 
despite conservative opposition he spearheaded in 1989 a 175 
billionayear package of childcare grants hes campaigned for 
escalation of the battle against aids and he sponsored a justice 
department program aimed at fighting hate crimes motivated by 
racial and religious bias 
the hate crimes bill put hatch on a collision course with sen 
jesse helms rnc who called it the flagship of the gay rights 
agenda 
hatch 56 scoffs at the notion that hes changed he remains a 
supporter of capital punishment a critic of gun control and an 
opponent of a major civil rights bill on capitol hill whose 
minorityhiring provision he says would inevitably lead to hiring 
quotas 
all the same a recent poll showed many utah voters believe hes 
moved in a more liberal direction 
and hes finding increasing favor with lawmakers he once fought 
he is open on some things said sen paul simon dill he 
has grown and i hope we can all grow he was superb on the 
hatecrimes bill 
lean at 6foot4 with every silvery hair in place and a taste 
for conservatively tailored dark suits and blazers hatch likes to 
tell of his humble origins as the son of a pittsburgh metal lather 
i grew up on the wrong side of the tracks he says we 
were poor poor people 
he worked as a janitor to help pay his way through brigham young 
university where he met his wife elaine they have three sons 
three daughters and 10 grandchildren 
he graduated from the university of pittsburgh law school and 
practiced in that city before returning to utah 
in 1976 he upset incumbent democratic sen frank moss in part 
with the help of hundreds of hatches in rural utah their numbers a 
legacy of the heavily mormon states polygamous past 
moss and other democrats however blamed roughandtumble 
tactics by new right conservatives washington groups whose 
trademark was mailorder campaigns designed to rise funds and 
energize voters around issues such as abortion and school prayer 
in the senate hatch is a vocal member of the judiciary 
committee where he ranks second behind sen strom thurmond rsc 
but his major post is that of top republican on the labor 
committee where hes often at odds with chairman edward m 
kennedy dmass 
but frequently hatch and kennedy reach a compromise as they 
did on a hatch bill opposed by some liberals that allows export of 
pharmaceuticals not yet approved by the food and drug 
administration for use in this country 
indeed the hatch record on such matters gives business little 
to complain about 
he is a firm backer of bills to rein in court damages in product 
liability and medical malpractice lawsuits major goals of the 
insurance industry and hes sponsoring a bill to allow the federal 
government to preempt tough state standards governing pesticides 
in foods 
hatch scoffs at complaints from liberal consumer groups that his 
bill would allow unsafe concentrations of pesticides in foods 
thats not based on science he says thats based on old 
wives tales 
senate republicans take little notice of strained ties between 
hatch and conservative activists they hail him as hardworking and 
effective 
im a real admirer of orrin hatch said sen john c 
danforth rmo 
he undertakes the toughest chores in the senate because he is 
the ranking republican on the labor committee danforth said 
the issues he involves himself in are often hotly controversial 
and take up a good deal of the senates time but he does his job 
with unflappable competence 
but such testimonials leave hardcore conservatives unmoved 
he has separated himself from us on social welfare 
legislation on what we would call gay rights legislation on a 
whole range of issues said new right pioneer paul weyrich 
weyrich says hatch has been shopping for issues to help broaden 
his support and hopes for an appointment to the us supreme court 
indeed when justice william brennan announced his retirement 
reporters were quick to corner hatch and ask if he wanted the post 
he said no 
hatch also says hes always been a champion of the underdog and 
that perhaps his conservative critics just havent noticed 
i have always been an advocate of those with disabilities 
those who are downtrodden who really cant help themselves he 
said what i have a problem with is people who can help 
themselves but wont 
at the same time he says his conservative critics should take a 
more careful look at his overall record 
i wonder who they think took the lead in fighting for a lot of 
the changes around here he said his voice rising i wonder 
who they think fought for fairness in the irancontra hearings 
that view is echoed by writeractivist patrick mcguigan author 
of a recent book on the battle over robert borks nomination to the 
supreme court mcguigan is an outspoken hatch admirer but says 
many would disagree 
there are a lot of conservatives who dont know him as well as 
i do who think orrin hatch has gone around the bend says 
mcguigan they think he isnt a conservative anymore

like many other machines that make the economy 
go the stock market seems to be running on oil these days 
more often than not in recent trading on wall street 
fluctuations in stock prices have looked like a virtual mirror 
image of the ups and downs of the oil market 
example last monday when the dow jones industrial average rose 
about 30 points in early trading as oil prices fell the dows 
gains abruptly vanished leaving the average with a 4point loss 
for the day immediately following an afternoon upsurge in oil 
prices 
there is no mystery about the connection investors have been 
making between the two markets 
when the price of oil doubles as it did this summer from about 
15 a barrel to 30plus it naturally tends to scramble the 
economic outlook in the united states and other energyimporting 
countries 
analysts earnings estimates have had to be recalculated from 
scratch not just in the energy business but in a broad range of 
other industries ranging from the airlines and automakers to 
chemical manufacturing and electric utilities 
with all that however a casual onlooker might still wonder how 
the fortunes of stocks in general might become so closely linked to 
what is happening in the market for a single commodity 
those who see a method in this mania say oil prices carry a 
special impact in part because of the precarious state of the 
economy that prevailed before iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
they view higher fuel costs as the functional equivalent of a 
tax increase draining off large amounts of disposable income at a 
time when the economy was already running low on supplies of money 
and credit 
prior to the oil shock we were forecasting a fullscale but 
moderate recession said richard hoey chief us economist at 
the investment banking firm of barclays de zoete wedd inc in new 
york 
in our view the oil price shock has not precipitated a 
recession but rather is likely to make the us recession which 
had already begun more severe 
as analysts attempt to determine the potential extent of such an 
economic slump each swing up or down in the oil price yields a new 
result from the equation 
at the same time however a good many observers believe the 
recent fixation on oil prices has gone to extremes that are typical 
of market psychology 
some analysts say the focus on oil provides a handy cover 
story while the market adjusts to a business slump that would 
have happened in any event 
it is widely believed that iraqs invasion of kuwait 
significantly altered the world outlook for peace and prosperity 
observed david resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international inc 
however the early data for august show no abrupt change in 
behavior unfortunately the data do show that the precrisis 
pattern of steady decline in activity continued in august 
still other market watchers suggest that oil news has kept many 
people from paying as much heed as they might to other developments 
of lasting import 
in the countrys fixation on the persian gulf it is easy to 
miss or ignore many other significant developments said raymond 
f devoe jr at legg mason wood walker inc 
among these he says one holds the promise of being the story 
of the decade or even of the postwar period the political and 
economic upheaval in the soviet union 
the soviet union no longer exists either as a coherent nation 
or economy devoe asserts this stunning fact will dominate 
world affairs for decades to come after the resolution of the 
persian gulf crisis

one of russias great abstract painters of the 
20th century out of favor when socialist realism was the only 
art for the soviets gets his biggest exhibit here on sunday 55 
years after his death 
kazimir severinovich malevich pronounced malyayvitch never 
went to prison as far as anyone can ascertain today however the 
director of the kiev art gallery was given a long sentence for 
mounting a show of his work 
malevich himself was arrested in 1930 after a trip to the west 
and questioned about ideologies deviations and right and left 
tendencies his friends burned some of his voluminous writings 
just in case 
he was one of the greatest and most original spokesman of the 
entire russian avantgarde soviet leader mikhail gorbachev wrote 
in the current catalog for the exhibit kazimir malevich 
18781935 raisa gorbachev added a tribute of her own 
and president bush in a letter welcoming the exhibit wrote 
the creative forms of kazimir malevich may be as complex and 
varied as the range of human emotions yet they unite us in our 
appreciation for his talent and vision 
work of these avantgarde artists for decades was confined to 
the cellars of soviet museums under gorbachevs policies of 
openness and reconstruction the soviets brought out malevichs 
work for a show in 1988 
armand hammer the american industrialist who has known soviet 
leaders since lenin helped get the pictures for the national 
gallery of art 
the russians rarely say nyet to hammer explained j 
carter brown director the national gallery 
after the exhibition closes at the national gallery on nov 4 
it will go to los angeles as the inaugural show at the armand 
hammer museum and cultural center 
malevich the son of a sugar mill manager produced his first 
finished painting in 1889 when he was 11 in the early years of 
the century he learned in moscow about the works of the great 
french impressionists and postimpressionists of the period he 
painted in versions of west european styles but always with a 
distinctive russian flavor 
some of his works resemble the paintings of fernand leger piet 
mondrian and even the distinctive stylings of paul cezanne 
malevich gradually moved away from pictures of recognizable people 
and objects 
world war i was a time of radical art movements in russia each 
with a fanciful name though he was asked not to antagonize the 
public by introducing still another name malevich called his own 
theory suprematism 
a key painting which has led to most comment over the years 
was simply a black square analysts claim to see many things under 
the unrelieved blackness visitors who prefer less abstract art may 
get more from his earlier and later work 
today we have advanced into a new fourth dimension of 
motion malevich wrote we have pulled up our consciousness by 
its roots from the earth it is now free to revolve in the infinity 
of space 
angelica zander rudenstine curator of the exhibit says that by 
suprematism he meant a higher kind of painting than the 
representation of familiar objects 
malevich joined enthusiastically in the revolutionary movements 
of 1917 in the first days of the soviet government it appointed 
him commissar for the preservation of monuments and antiquities 
especially those in the kremlin but when he visited the west in 
1929 with paintings for a show in berlin he took the precaution of 
leaving them behind 
many were acquired later by the stadelijk museum in amsterdam 
and brought to washington for the current show 
toward the end of his life malevich returned to painting 
recognizable figures but they were flat and unrealistic not 
socialist realism at all some he did in a much earlier style and 
put earlier dates on them his last works were realistic portraits 
including a selfportrait in which he wore clothes of the italian 
renaissance 
the exhibit will be at the armand hammer museum and cultural 
center in los angeles from nov 25 to jan 13 from feb 7 through 
march 24 it will show at the metropolitan museum of art in new 
york

one year after hurricane hugo smashed 
ashore charleston still bears the scars from the most destructive 
hurricane ever to hit the us mainland 
shingles are missing from the tattered roof of st michaels 
episcopal church the oldest in the city and the spire at the top 
of the bell tower has yet to be replaced 
the nearby charleston county courthouse stands empty its roof 
destroyed masking tape still lines its windows preparation for 
the storm that thundered ashore a year ago this week 
but across meeting street city hall bustles with the business 
of government just as it did that lightless night last sept 21 
when hugo crashed into south carolina packing winds of 135 mph 
hugos wrath claimed 29 lives on the us mainland and was felt 
across hundreds of miles from fishing communities on the south 
carolina coast to mill towns nestled in the north carolina 
mountains the storm caused an estimated 59 billion damage 
a year later the recovery both physical and emotional 
continues but for a relatively small poor state a lot has been 
done in the past 12 months to put things back in order 
its a miracle were back where we are given the enormity of 
the storm that hit us and the fact that over half our state was 
declared a disaster area gov carroll campbell said 
he noted that the beaches have been repaired and the tourism 
industry has rebounded 
the historic district the heart of charlestons tourist 
economy was scrubbed up in quick order indeed visitors would 
have trouble telling charleston took the brunt of such a severe 
storm 
the recovery has been phenomenal said mayor joseph p riley 
jr it is almost a miracle its a tribute to the citizens of the 
community they didnt cry or whine or get angry everybody got to 
work and pitched in 
during the past year the city opened a waterfront park and a 
new visitors center is nearing completion 
the city has not only recovered this was not a year we 
treaded water riley said 
but the recovery among the rural poor has taken longer the 
sound of hammers and the buzz of power saws still can be heard on 
the hardhit barrier islands northeast of town 
following hugo hundreds of tons of supplies and about 37 
million in donations flooded into charleston last month the final 
1 million was distributed to relief agencies 
richard hendry of the trident community foundation said more 
could have been used there was not near enough to meet requests 
which totaled almost 8 million he said 
the needs are still being uncovered hendry said 
in rural berkeley county about 150 people wait to have homes 
repaired or rebuilt said henry bonner executive director of 
berkeley county interfaith disaster ministries 
no matter how much publicity weve had since the storm its 
surprising how many people hear about us by wordofmouth for the 
first time bonner said 
the donations of money and building supplies that followed the 
storm have tapered off now most of the help comes from south 
carolinians 
were finding since the emergency a lot of people have been 
able to get friends and relatives to help in the repairs bonner 
added last winter people were struggling to get over the storm 
they couldnt help each other 
hugo brought a building boom to the sea islands 
vacant lots remain in places where weathered bungalows once 
lined the beach much of the debris has been cleared and new 
houses are going up 
but a block from the ocean on sullivans island weeds sprout 
through the floorboards of a rusted red sports car the car sits in 
front of a shattered house next to the battered hulk of a pickup 
truck 
next door a crew of about 20 workers labors in the hot sun on a 
new beach house with an ocean view 
to the north in the small shrimping hamlet of mcclellanville 
streets have been cleared of debris the local shrimp fleet is 
again plying the atlantic but the rotting hulls of two shrimp 
boats tossed ashore by hugo still bear mute witness to the storms 
fury 
it was a boom year for construction with thousands of workers 
flooding the area officials estimate about 3 billion was pumped 
into the charleston area economy for construction services and 
trade 
many of the physical scars have healed but the emotional toll 
is more difficult to assess 
the hugo outreach program sponsored by the state department of 
mental health counseled more than 26000 people during the past 
year 
during recent weeks an increase has been noted in requests for 
help said cathy joyner a counselor with the program 
were seeing a lot of people who have not physically 
recovered and they realize they are frightened and anxious she 
said an anniversary is an opportunity to go back and reevaluate 
where they were a year ago and see if they have made any progress 
it will be frightening for a lot of people to see they are not 
where they want to be 
since hugo there have been increases in domestic abuse reports 
people seeking help with drinking problems and divorce filings 
counselors say 20000 south carolinians could suffer longterm 
psychological problems officials hope the outreach program which 
includes 50 counselors statewide can be extended through spring 
local governments will mark the storm anniversary with a 
candlelight observance at city hall several commercial events also 
will note the occasion including a road race and a golf 
exposition 
for some it will be a trying time 
lynn ziegler heads the building committee for the sunrise 
presbyterian church on sullivans island 
the church was destroyed in the storm and the congregation has 
met in a tent since last january a new building wont be in place 
until next year 
mrs zieglers house on the isle of palms was not severely 
damaged and she said she suffered from survivors guilt 
i had been praying for some way to help said mrs ziegler 
who worked in relief efforts after the storm when asked to chair 
the building committee i felt i was unqualified 
but then i saw this was the answer to my prayers she said

as the expiration of the contract between the 
united auto workers and general motors corp neared negotiators 
for the two sides were keeping mum 
the threeyear national pact covering 300000 workers is to 
expire at midnight friday if gm and the uaw neither reaches an 
agreement nor extendes the current contract the union could call a 
strike 
meanwhile more than 85 percent of the local issues between the 
union and gm remained unresolved thursday awaiting a final 
agreement on a national contract gm and uaw leaders said the slow 
pace of loca agreements was not unusual 
 
washington ap energy secretary james watkins said he sees no 
sign of pricegouging by the oil industry and characterized the 
surge in gasoline prices as not unreasonable considering crude 
oil market conditions 
watkins was asked repeatedly about gasoline costs at a hearing 
thursday of the senate energy and natural resources committee oil 
prices have risen dramatically since iraq occupied kuwait and some 
consumer groups and politicians have raised allegations of 
pricegouging 
sen kent conrad dnd told watkins that there will be a 
tremendous outrage if we see a surge in profits for the oil 
companies when they next release quarterly financial statements 
 
new york ap prosecutors filed a sentencing report about 
financier michael milken that is believed to allege numerous 
uncharged crimes but it was not immediately made public even 
though the news media wants access 
an attorney for milken said he would oppose release of the 
papers filed thursday before the former drexel burnham lambert 
inc junk bond executive is sentenced on oct 1 for his guilty plea

the new kids on the block are doing 
almost as well in plastic as they are in vinyl 
a million of the 12inch fashion dolls have been sold since 
they were introduced a month ago wayne charness a spokesman for 
toymaker hasbro inc said thursday 
thats platinum 
by comparison the pop groups latest album in step went 
triple platinum last month two months after it was released said 
an official with the record industry association of america who 
asked that her name not be used 
while not quite as popular as the records retailers cannot 
keep their store shelves stocked with the dolls charness said 
we expect whatever we get for the remainder of the year will 
sell out said stephen j sanberg a wholesale toy distributor 
for h sanberg and sonsanco toy of foxboro mass its a 
pleasant surprise in a relatively flat toy year 
its selling well now and we expect it to continue doing well 
through christmas said angela bourdon spokeswoman for the toys 
r us inc chain 
for hasbro which had slow sales this year the dolls 
popularity is good news sluggish sales in the secondquarter cut 
the companys profits to 87 million down nearly 52 percent from 
the same period a year ago 
alan g hassenfeld chairman and chief executive said at the 
time that he still expected a yearend result similar to 1989 
based on anticipated sales of the new kids dolls and others 
resembling members of the world wrestling federation 
hasbro whose line also includes traditional favorites such as 
gi joe and mr potato head had net sales of about 141 billion 
last year 
we are extremely pleased by the new kids dolls firstmonth 
performance charness said early indications are that we have 
a real hit on our hands 
there are two styles of new kids dolls one in concert clothes 
that comes with a tape and retails for about 18 and one in street 
clothes that sells for about 15 
charness said dolls usually attract girls aged 4 to 10 but the 
new kids also have been selling to young teenagers up to age 15 
the older girls are using them as a kind of threedimensional 
poster he said 
its been five years since a major toy company made a doll based 
on a pop group a michael jackson doll launched by ljn toys ltd 
of new york was on the market for less than a year but did 
exceptionally well for a short period of time a spokesman 
said 
other new kids products marketed by various companies include a 
book beach towels watches tshirts lunch boxes and a tv cartoon 
show 
charness said there are plans at hasbro for new kids in 1991 
that we think will extend the longevity of the doll but he 
would not identify the plans 
an unidentified toy industry source told the providence 
journalbulletin that a soft stuffed new kids doll will be

local union bargainers with contracts of their 
own to negotiate are closely watching progress in national talks 
between the united auto workers union and general motors corp as 
tonights contract expirations draw near 
as of thursday tentative agreements still hadnt been reached 
in about 85 percent of more than 100 gmuaw local contracts a gm 
official who declined to be identified said company executives 
were satisfied with that level and that such a pace was normal 
local contracts like the national gmuaw agreement expire at 
midnight 
main issues facing national negotiators include job security and 
wage increases issues in local talks var widely from plant to 
plant including matters such as location of break areas 
availability of emergency health care and plant safety larger 
economic and noneconomic issues affecting all auto workers are 
reserved for the national contract 
there are 155 gm facilities with uawrepresented employees the 
vast majority of which are parts plants fourteen of the locals 
have living agreements with no expiration dates 
seventeen uaw locals had reached tentative local agreements by 
thursday the company official said the remaining 124 locals have 
yet to reach agreements 
leaders of some union locals may have taken the advice of uaw 
vice president stephen yokich who said last week that it may be a 
good idea to keep at least one local issue open as national 
negotiations neared the deadline 
were meeting every day and things are moving along but a lot 
of bearing has to do with national negotiations and progress 
there said dave kimmel president of uaw local 1714 at gms 
metal stamping plant in lordstown ohio when that gets through 
then the process locally will speed up 
bargainers for gm and uaw local 276 at the automakers car 
assembly plant in arlington texas reached a local agreement last 
month well ahead of the deadline said local president dave 
perdue 
four years ago the local renegotiated its contract with gm so 
there wasnt too much work to do this time he said it was a 
finetuning sort of thing perdue said 
labor relations at parts and component plants have become 
increasingly important as the huge automaker relies more on the 
justintime parts system which delivers components to 
assembly plants sometimes just a few hours before theyre needed on 
assembly lines 
because of that a walkout at a parts plant over a local issue 
can quickly stop assembly plant production if such a strike were 
prolonged idling assembly plants other parts plants could be 
affected 
gm learned the potential effects of such a strike last month 
when uaw local 659 in flint struck a fueltank factory for six 
days by the time the dust settled seven assembly plants had shut 
down and portions of more than a dozen other parts plants were 
idled 
wall street analysts have speculated the strike by about 2800 
local 659 members will create a 50 million dent in gms 
thirdquarter earnings because of lost assembly plant production

lighttruck sales lagged as middle east tensions 
boosted gas prices but a rise in car purchases brought overall 
sales of north americanmade vehicles up 24 percent in early 
september 
the 10 major companies making cars in the united states said 
average daily sales crept up to 31065 in the sept 110 period 
from an average of 30333 a day in early september 1989

for the period 
car sales by general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp were virtually flat edging up just 08 percent while sales 
of cars made by japanese companies in north america jumped 819 
percent 
a 68percent slide in lighttruck sales overwhelmed the 
carsales increase for an overall 22 percent decline for the big 
three in the 10day period 
rising gas prices were just one concern of consumers who also 
worried about the economy in general and their jobs gm spokesman 
terry sullivan said 
but automotive analyst maryann keller of furman selz mager dietz 
amp birney in new york blamed the dent in truck sales on gas price 
increases after iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
these are the gas guzzlers of this decade keller said 
gasoline is suddenly more expensive and they look at a truck and 
they see a healthy 14 miles a gallon and they say there might be 
a place where i might spend my money more efficiently 
for the year through sept 10 north americanmade cars and 
light trucks sold at a rate of 36460 a day down 45 percent from

capitol hill staffers say a suggested tax on 
securities transactions appears to be foundering but opponents are 
still mounting a massive lobbying effort just in case 
i think rumors of the demise of it are probably premature but 
i havent heard any great clamoring out there for it i have not 
talked to anyone who thinks its a good idea but its not dead a 
lobbyist who spoke on condition of anonymity said thursday 
however several congressional staffers who did not want to be 
identified during the sensitive budget negotiations said the 
taxs chances look weak at best 
the transaction tax is i think dead said a house staffer 
familiar with the budget discussions if theres any life to it 
its wheezing on the floor 
the last i heard it was not dead but it seemed to be 
reeling said a staffer on another house committee 
securities firms have run newspaper ads against a rumored 
transaction tax on the sale of stocks bonds futures contracts and 
other financial products opponents say the tax would hurt 
everyone not just wall street because the tax would eventually be 
passed on to customers and make it harder for companies and local 
governments to raise money through bonds and other securities 
there have been published reports since july that the bush 
administration was considering a stock trading excise tax between 
15 percent and 5 percent as a means of closing the budget gap 
officials believe that the deficit will likely exceed 250 
billion a record in the upcoming fiscal year unless something 
is done without a budget agreement by oct 1 the grammrudman 
deficitreduction law will shrink the 12 trillion budget by 100 
billion an amount that would disrupt most federal programs and 
agencies 
but since securities and futures exchanges pension and mutual 
fund groups and local politicians in new york and chicago rose up 
to oppose the proposed securities tax little has been heard about 
it around congress 
in broad terms ive heard no mention of that kind of tax 
being proposed by anyone in these discussions said a senate aide 
close to the negotiations who spoke on condition he not be 
identified 
the congressional budget office estimates that a broadly based 
5 percent tax on all securities except treasury securities would 
raise about 12 billion a year to start 
but opponents say those numbers will never be reached because 
the tax would make trading more expensive driving business 
overseas and leaving fewer transactions to tax 
they also say the increased costs to high volume traders like 
insurance companies and pension funds would be passed on to 
customers pensioners or in the case of public employee pension 
funds taxpayers 
even the congressional research service in a report issued in 
july noted that a half penny tax on transactions could cut trading 
volume in the stock market by 79 percent and reduce stock market 
prices by as much as 77 percent 
numerous groups spearheded by the securities industry 
association and the public securities association have written 
congress and the white house arguing against a securities tax 
new york city officials have also been vocal in their opposition 
to the tax saying it would hurt the citys securities industry and 
the local economy

watch out fat cats pet food manufacturers 
are competing for the right to reduce your ranks 
and the new battleground is the supermarket rather than 
specialty pet stores 
starting this month heinz pet products co is distributing a 
diet cat food to grocery stores nationwide the company says lean 
entrees its new 9lives product is the first national line of 95 
percent fatfree canned cat food 
the company a subsidiary of pittsburghbased hj heinz co is 
hoping for greater sales in the supermarkets than it could achieve 
in specialty stores and is targeting owners who fear their felines 
are putting on pounds 
weve got our fingers crossed said ed johnson general 
manager of cat food marketing for heinz pet products which moved 
its headquarters last year to this northern kentucky city from long 
beach calif 
it may be a while before results are clear diet pet food is too 
new to have made any measurable market impact said william leach 
an industry analyst with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities 
corp 
diet pet food just seems kind of ridiculous to me he added 
there are so many people starving in the world and pet owners 
are worried about their pets getting fat 
the entry of reducedfat reducedcalorie products into the cat 
food market is a carryover from the human interest in those 
concerns said patrick farrell a spokesman for ralston purina co 
of st louis 
his company came out several months ago with cat chow mature a 
reducedfat reducedcalorie dry cat food sold in supermarkets 
its marketed for older more sedentary cats 
its an area thats become popular recently more and more 
consumers are taking an interest and youre seeing more products 
coming out in response to that he said 
the big thing right now in consumer human food is fat 
lowfat i think that trend is carrying forward into pet food 
johnson said 
fat cats are a growing problem heinz estimates that 20 percent 
of the nations cats are overweight like obese humans they have a 
greater risk of heart ailments or other fatal maladies 
heinz says health and fitness pet foods have been sold 
mostly in specialty pet stores and veterinary clinics those 
businesses account for about 20 percent of the 59 billion us 
market for cat and dog food says heinz which produces cat and dog 
food 
lean entrees results from a year of development johnson said 
he declined to reveal what the companys sales projections are or 
how much it cost to develop the product nationwide television 
advertisements promoting the product will begin next month 
competitors also are trying to claw their way into the market 
ralston purina has its cat chow mature for the past three 
years its also sold pro plan cat food a line of products 
including a light formula intended for aging fat cats 
we dont discuss sales figures but its meeting our 
expectations farrell said 
lean entrees features five popular flavors from the 9lives 
line liver and beef beef and seafood chicken and seafood stew 
chicken and liver entree and ocean fish and shrimp stew a can 
will cost 39 cents a few pennies more than 9lives regular 
variety

gasoline prices have jumped an average 20 
percent in the six weeks since iraq invaded kuwait but energy 
secretary james watkins calls the rise not unreasonable and 
discounts suggestions that oil companies are gouging consumers 
watkins was asked repeatedly about gasoline costs during a 
thursday hearing of the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
sen kent conrad dnd told watkins the public is awaiting 
release of quarterly statistics on oil company profits and 
predicted there will be a tremendous outrage if we see a surge in 
profits 
the secretary said his department would keep an eye on the 
profit reports but he spoke out against legislation introduced 
earlier in the week that would prohibit unreasonable price 
increases for petroleum products he said such a law would amount 
to price control and require a massive bureaucracy to ensure 
adequate monitoring 
since iraq overran kuwait aug 2 gasoline prices have risen 
about 20 percent at the pump while crude oil prices have jumped 
about 55 percent according to the american petroleum institute 
watkins acknowledged that initial increases at the pump were 
greater than the early rises in oil prices however he said 
retail increases in recent weeks have lagged about 4 cents a 
gallon behind hikes on the spot crude oil market 
americans on average are paying 22 cents a gallon more for 
unleaded gasoline today than before aug 2 while the spot price 
for crude is 26 cents a gallon higher according to government and 
industry officials 
watkins told the senate panel that the pricing of gasoline is 
working very well and is rather typical of the supply and demand 
situation the secretary said he considered the recent price 
hikes not unreasonable 
a group of senators said wednesday they would try to push 
through in the coming weeks legislation that would strengthen 
federal laws against price gouging by oil companies 
the laws of gravity and economics clearly dont seem to apply 
to gas prices what goes up stays up said sen joseph lieberman 
dconn they charge what they can get away with 
the bill sponsored by lieberman and other senators would 
prohibit unreasonable price increases in petroleum products 
including gasoline and heating oil and would make profiteering 
a criminal offense punishable by a maximum fiveyear jail sentence 
and 500000 fine 
watkins said his department would watch for unscrupulous 
business people taking advantage of oil shortages but said he 
didnt want to assume that everyone in america is a crook

wholesale prices shot up 13 percent in 
august the biggest surge in seven months as the first shock wave 
from the persian gulf crisis hit the american economy the 
government said today 
the labor department blamed virtually the entire increase on 
higher oil costs that followed iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
the fallout from the persian gulf turmoil has heightened 
economists fears that higher inflationary pressures could push an 
already weak us economy into a recession 
in another report today the government said retail sales 
slumped 06 percent in august despite a huge jump in the amount of 
money people spent on gasoline 
sales at gasoline stations climbed 64 percent in august the 
largest increase since an 83 percent advance in august 1979 the 
commerce department said but sales in nearly every other category 
dropped to cause the downturn in consumer spending which 
represents twothirds of the nations economic activity retail 
sales account for half of consumer spending 
another worrisome government report issued today showed 
industrial production dropped 02 percent in august which 
economists linked to higher energy prices and their effect on 
factory activity it was the manufacturing sectors worst monthly 
performance since a similar decline in april 
the august rise in wholesale prices the largest since a cold 
snap caused a 19 percent spurt in january would translate into an 
annual increase of 164 percent if prices rose that much each 
month the government said 
that is far above the 3 percent advance in the producer price 
index from january through july 
while prices settled down after the january increase analysts 
were worried that this inflation outbreak could become more 
entrenched filtering through to the thousands of products made 
with petroleum or that must be transported long distances 
eventually wages that are linked to the cost of living could rise 
as well analysts said 
the initial round is so large it implies that the 
ripplethrough effect in coming months will be quite sizable 
the worst is yet to come said allen sinai chief economist at 
the boston co 
the first shot of oil and energy inflation suggest a wave of 
inflation in the us economy that will be in high single digits 
for three to six months in turn it will squeeze purchasing power 
enough to produce a substantial recession sinai said 
robert dederick of the northern trust co of chicago said 
todays data on high wholesale inflation coupled with weak growth 
indicates that the iraqi conflict threatens to push a vulnerable 
us economy into recession 
it may well be the shock that broke the camels back because 
the back was already bending dederick said 
todays report on wholesale prices will be followed next tuesday 
by the governments first look at inflation at the consumer level 
since the upheaval in the middle east that report is expected to 
be equally bad given the fact that pump prices of gasoline went up 
almost immediately 
in august energy costs overall rose 95 percent the government 
said today gasoline jumped 169 percent while fuel oil skyrocketed 
388 percent natural gas was down 94 percent todays report 
said 
inflation at earlier stages of the production process was up 
sharply too largely due to the gulf crisis the labor department 
said crude goods jumped 93 percent their steepest monthly 
increase in 17 years intermediate goods jumped 13 percent 
an example of the three processing stages would be clothing for 
finished goods cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude 
food prices overall were up 08 percent after remaining 
unchanged in july fresh fruit prices fell 63 percent after 
jumping 14 percent in july 
egg prices which had declined by 183 percent in july soared 
258 percent in august the government said 
costs were up for rice pasta beef coffee and cooking oils 
prices were down for bakery products pork young chickens and 
dairy products 
prices for goods excluding volatile food and energy items 
often taken by economists as a better barometer of underlying 
inflationary pressures rose 03 percent in july this socalled 
core rate had declined 01 percent for the first drop in a year 
passenger car prices were up 08 percent after having declined 
05 percent in july the government said 
clothing prices were mixed with a 03 percent rise for womens 
apparel but a 02 percent decline for girls childrens and 
infants clothing there was no change in the cost of mens and 
boys apparel footwear fell 03 percent 
tobacco prices increased 09 percent and were 132 percent 
higher than they were a year ago 
the various changes put the producer price index for all 
finished goods at 1192 in august that means a hypothetical 
selection of goods that cost 100 in 1982 cost 11920 last month 
up from 11340 a year earlier 
the overall weakness of the nations economy it grew at an 
anemic 15 percent annual rate during the first half of the year 
probably kept wholesale inflation relatively low before the middle 
east erupted analysts said

canadas largest offshore oil 
drilling project has been approved and construction is expected to 
begin almost immediately the nations federal energy minister 
announced today 
the formal goahead for the 52 billion 45 billion us 
hibernia oil project off newfoundlands coast was announced by 
federal energy minister jake epp as a major advancement for the 
economically troubled atlantic province 
hibernia will bring jobs and economic diversification to 
newfoundland and all of canada he said the development of the 
hibernia oil field will diversify canadas sources of oil supply 
the opening up of this new frontier will put canadians at the 
leading edge of offshore development technologies 
the project is a collaboration between the federal government 
the province and a consortium of four oil companies led by mobil 
oil canada 
ottawa will contribute 27 billion 23 billion us to the 
project in cash and loan guarantees the rest will come from the 
operating companies and newfoundland which will help out with tax 
breaks during contruction 
the consortium estimates up to 31 billion 27 billion us 
of the total capital construction costs will go to canadian 
companies production is expected to start in 1996 and last about 
20 years 
the companies estimate the hibernia field has recoverable oil 
reserves of 525 million to 650 million barrels the peak output 
will be about 110000 barrels a day 
epp was joined in the announcement by international trade 
minister john crosbie premier clyde wells provincial energy 
minister rex gibbons and several other officials 
the announcement ends weeks of speculation about the agreement 
the underwater oil reserve was discovered a decade ago about 190 
miles southeast of st johns years of negotiations followed over 
issues such as the split in development costs and amount of 
benefits to go to newfoundland 
a tentative agreement was reached in 1988 since then three 
deadlines for a formal goahead have passed 
mobils redesign last year of the topside sections of the 
hibernia production platform which will house production 
facilities and living quarters above the water contributed to the 
delay 
also the federal government promised the consortium which 
includes gulf canada resources chevron canada resources and 
petrocanada 27 billion 23 billion us canadian in cash 
and loan guarantees 
but a bill authorizing ottawas contribution was pulled in late 
june after the collapse of a constitutional accord that stirred 
controversy across canada over recognition of quebecs french 
canadians as a distinct society 
wells cancelled a vote on the accord in the newfoundland 
legislature and conservative parliament members from quebec are 
believed to have threatened to vote against the bill in retaliation 
for wellss action 
prime minister brian mulroneys absence from the announcement 
today has fueled speculation that tensions are still high

investors eager to do their futures and options 
trading at night will have to wait a little longer 
partners in globex a proposed 24hour electronic system for 
trading financial futures and options said thursday they have 
pushed back the planned startup date from november to the first 
quarter of 1991 
the latest obstacle involves modifications to accommodate 
products offered by the chicago board of trade according to a 
statement issued jointly by the board of trade the chicago 
mercantile exchange and reuters holdings plc a british company 
that is supplying technology for the system 
the board of trade joined the venture in may after abandoning 
plans to develop a competing system 
the parties also have yet to iron out a firm agreement on 
sharing the operation of the system which is subject to approval 
by the board of trades directors and members according to the 
twoparagraph statement 
when the merc and reuters announced their globex plans in 
september 1987 they projected a launch date in the first quarter 
of 1989 
the parties said they have been pleased with the results of 
testing globexs functions 
globex would operate during the hours that the exchanges 
trading floors are closed 
it would theoretically enable participating brokers around the 
world to get orders filled at any time either through the 
traditional openoutcry method when the trading floors are open or 
through blind ordermatching by the globex computer when the floors 
are closed

a virtual news blackout on national contract 
negotiations between the united auto workers union and general 
motors corp continued as bargainers faced a contract expiration 
tonight 
bargaining resumed this morning company and union officials 
said there was no allnight session thursday 
there was speculation thursday night that the silence indicated 
negotiators were making slow but steady progress toward a new 
threeyear agreement covering more than 300000 workers at the 
worlds largest automaker the current pact expires at midnight 
major issues yet to be resolved included job security wages and 
pensions according to a uaw official who declined to be 
identified tentative agreements have been reached on a variety of 
mostly noneconomic issues including health and safety and 
attendance policy 
the detroit free press reported in todays edition that gm and 
the union have agreed tentatively to a contract provision involving 
uaw leaders in decisions about where auto components or entire 
vehicles are made 
the newspaper quoting unidentified union officials said there 
were no references to specific goals for increasing the use of gm 
facilities and uaw workers in manufacturing parts for the huge 
automaker 
the sourcing issue has been emotional for uaw members who 
have complained the company has turned its back on unionized 
american workers in favor of nonunion sometimes overseas 
factories 
uaw vice president stephen yokich head of the unions 
bargaining effort with gm made a brief appearance thursday night 
in a hallway of the gm building where the negotiators are working 
he was dogged by reporters and television camera crews 
he declined to say anything about the talks 
everybody is curious dave perdue president of uaw local 
276 at gms arlington texas assembly plant said thursday 
theyre hungry for information 
the lack of information the lack of strike rhetoric that 
tells me i should anticipate a settlement 
in addition to the national contract more than 100 gmuaw local 
contracts covering specific working conditions on a plantbyplant 
basis remained unresolved thursday 
those contracts also expire at midnight as do uaw contracts 
with ford motor co and chrysler corp 
but the ford and chrysler talks have been put on hold pending 
the outcome of negotiations between the union and gm in all more 
than 450000 active workers are covered by the three contracts 
in a recorded telephone message for uaw members yokich said 
thursday that more work remains for negotiators who began working 
on the new contract in late july 
the deadline is quickly approaching and we must see more 
movement by the corporation if we are to reach tentative agreement 
prior to the deadline he said i urge you to stay in close 
touch with your local officers about our plans as we approach 
midnight on friday 
as the deadline drew near there was increasing speculation that 
if an agreement wasnt reached before midnight then bargainers 
would extend the current contract through the weekend 
weve got very little information here as far as national 
negotiations said jerry gorski financial secretary of uaw local 
634 in buffalo ny whatever theyve got theyre keeping it 
under their hats 
i imagine theyll probably have an extension 
any strike called by the uaw wouldnt have any significant 
effects until monday most gm plants are scheduled to close for the 
weekend 
the uaw has called a meeting of its gm bargaining council for 
monday in dearborn a suburb of detroit for local presidents and 
bargaining committee heads that announcement prompted speculation 
that negotiators were closer to a settlement than a strike 
another union official said the meeting could be used to brief 
union leaders on a strike but it more likely would be used to 
discuss a tentative settlement 
uaw locals nationwide put the finishing touches on strike plans 
thursday 
mike obrien president of uaw local 95 at gms janesville 
wis truck and bus plant said his members were prepared for a 
strike picket line assignments have been made and signs will be 
ready by the deadline 
meantime in canada bargaining continued today between officials 
of the canadian auto workers and fords canadian subsidiary over a 
contract covering about 12800 workers like the uawgm contract 
the cawford agreement expires at midnight 
the rhetoric in the toronto talks has been much higher than in 
the us negotiations caw president bob white said the two sides 
remain far apart

the cabinet friday authorized stateowned 
iberia airlines to buy the 48 percent stake in charter airline viva 
air currently held by west germanys lufthansa 
the government said in a news release that the purchase by 
iberia will raise the flag carriers control of shares in vuelos 
internacionales de vacaciones sa viva air to 96 percent 
the purchase of lufthansas stake for the equivalent of about 
84 million will permit iberia to transform viva air from a 
tourist charter carrier to a company with regular international 
flights to england germany and france the release said 
iberia and lufthansa founded viva air in february 1988 its 
original nominal share capital totaled about 175 million each 
airline took a 48 percent stake 
other founding partners infoleasing sa and west german tour 
operator a paukner are expected to retain their 2 percent 
interests 
the move is in step with other iberia efforts to expand its 
european and intercontinental service 
last july an iberialed consortium agreed to buy 85 percent of 
argentinas state carrier aerolineas argentinas for 130 million in 
cash 130 million in 10 installments and the retirement of 2 
billion of argentine foreign debt 
aerolineas ownership transfer is set for oct 8 although it may 
be delayed 
lufthans officials last spring told iberia they wanted to sell 
their viva air stake because of concerns tourist travel to spain 
was declining and they wanted to focus on their expanding interests 
in central europe 
the spanish tourism secretariat reported last aug 27 that 278 
million tourists visited spain through the first seven months of 
the year down 26 percent from the same period a year earlier 
iberia president miguel aguilo said wednesday that iberia 
planned to have viva airs future flights cover travel on 
nontrunk international routes 
aguilo said those were between smaller spanish cities and major 
european cities and between smaller european cities and major 
spanish cities flights not always profitable for iberia 
viva air owns five boeing 737300 aircraft leases two dc9 
aircraft from iberia and employs 145 people 
in its first full year of operations last year viva air 
reported a profit of the equivalent of about 165 million on 
revenue of 752 million

stock prices lost more ground today as the 
market absorbed new signs of steppedup inflation and weak consumer 
spending 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1708 to 
256559 by noontime on wall street 
losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading 
of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 320 up 961 down and 
502 unchanged 
the labor department reported this morning that the producer 
price index of finished goods jumped 13 percent in august mostly 
because of sharp rises in energy prices separately the commerce 
department said retail sales dropped 06 percent 
neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to wall 
street analysts who have been busy since midsummer trying to 
estimate the possible fallout from the showdown in the middle east 
and a doubling of world oil prices 
nevertheless analysts said the data served to reinforce fears 
of stagflation a combination of sluggish growth and increased 
inflationary pnking official said the government is 
considering ways to renegotiate some of the sale contracts but does 
not intend to break them 
in a report released at the hearing investigators for the 
banking committee said outside investors in troubled thrifts 
received 78 in assets and governmentgranted benefits for every 1 
of capital they put up to buy the institutions 
these socalled deals bear all the earmarks of a giveaway 
with the recipients of the government largesse being some of the 
fattest of the nations financial fat cats rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas said at a hearing we are hopeful that there 
can be renegotiations that rectify some of the excesses 
gonzalez said his committee will haunt the resolution trust 
corp the agency responsible for disposing of failed sampls until 
we have hard evidence that everything is being done to recover as 
many of the billions as possible 
l william seidman who heads the rtc and the federal deposit 
insurance corp told the committee that the rtcs efforts are to 
minimize costs to the government within the provisions of the 
contracts 
we are not considering breaking the governments agreements 
he said 
the committee report concluded that 94 sampl deals completed in 
late 1988 will cost the government around 71 billion in assistance 
to buyers of the thrifts including up to 42 billion in tax 
breaks 
the investigators study focused particularly on the sales of 
american savings bank fa of california and two giant texas thrifts 
southwest savings association and first gibraltar federal savings 
bank 
in the american savings and first gibraltar deals the buyers 
were given generous tax breaks the study said 
a separate report released late thursday by the general 
accounting office found that the rescue of american savings will 
cost taxpayers 52 billion three times the governments original 
estimate the institution was purchased by a group led by 
billionaire investor robert m bass 
southwest savings was purchased in 1988 by caroline hunt the 
daughter of legendary oilman hl hunt with the help of government 
subsidies projected to total 2 billion over 10 years despite the 
federal aid the thrift failed a second time and went back to the 
government 
m danny wall the former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board also was expected to testify at the hearing 
wall who presided over the 1988 sales has defended them as a 
crash effort by the government to transfer into private hands 
insolvent sampls that were draining billions of dollars from the 
federal insurance fund 
but critics have charged that in its mad rush to complete the 
sampl sales in late 1988 the government entered into contracts that 
virtually assure the buyers a profit from generous government 
subsidies that will end up costing taxpayers more in the long run 
unless the bush administration renegotiates some of the sales 
critics say it would further swell the cost to taxpayers of the 
sampl bailout already estimated at 500 billion 
there is an obligation to renegotiate some of these deals 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said tuesday metzenbaum who 
chairs a senate judiciary subcommittee said he would press the 
administration to renegotiate several of the 1988 deals 
metzenbaum was completing a series of hearings on one of the 
most controversial 1988 deals the sale of what is now known as 
bluebonnet savings bank to james m fail an arizona insurance 
executive 
fail put up only 1000 of his own money and borrowed another 
70 million to complete a transaction that investigators said 
qualified him for at least 185 billion in government subsidies 
the deal will cost taxpayers up to 3 billion metzenbaum says 
the investigation by the house banking committee is one of 
several conducted recently on the 1988 sales which were made by 
the nowdefunct federal home loan bank board 
the resolution trust corp is scheduled to complete its own 
study soon into whether the government would be better off by 
exercising contract options allowing the government to get out of 
some of the guarantees made in the 1988 deals 
according to a recent fdic report the 1988 sales of around 200 
failed sampls cost taxpayers 46 billion in 1989 the fdics 
estimate which is the first official accounting of the cost does 
ot include tax breaks given to buyers of the thrifts

arizona public service co following up on a 
midyear announcement that it hoped to cut capital expenditures and 
trim its budget says it will eliminate 675 fulltime positions 
aps president mark de michele said thursday that one goal for 
the states largest utility was to reduce our pending 
rateincrease request before the arizona corporation commission and 
work toward a period of price stability 
de michele said he could not provide specifics on the size of 
the reduction 
aps executives said the cuts are needed to keep rates at a 
reasonable level and match competition in the utility industry 
in january aps filed a 271 million rate proposal seeking 
increases of 68 percent in 1991 1992 and 1993 the request has 
been amended to 65 percent per year or 259 million 
a sluggish economy that has resulted in a slowdown of customer 
growth also is a major factor in the costcutting effort the 
utility has roughly 591000 residential and commercial customers 
this is the third time aps has eliminated positions to try to 
cut costs it has cut 1548 jobs since 1988 generating 63 million 
in savings 
de michele said that in addition to the 13 percent cut in the 
companys fulltime nonnuclear workforce of 4908 aps will 
eliminate another 450 jobs by not filling vacant positions 
the targeted jobs include those of 300 unionized employees 315 
clericalprofessional positions and about 60 managers and 
supervisors they do not include about 400 jobs eliminated since 
jan 1 when the company had nearly 5800 fulltime employees and 
decided to adopt an earlyretirement program 
the reductions do not affect either employees or contract 
workers at the palo verde nuclear generating station the only 
nuclear facility in the state said aps spokesman wayne kaplan 
about 2840 people are on the palo verde workforce kaplan said 
the statement withheld details of the companys revised filing 
and stability plans and said the reorganization would take until 
the end of the year to complete 
under the plan employees holding jobs targeted for elimination 
first will be offered positions within the company a voluntary 
severance plan will follow layoffs then will go into effect aps 
executives said

customers of the failed stotler amp co may have to 
wait up to six months to receive payments after the chicago board 
of trade turned down a plan to pay off 930000 of the companys 
debt 
stotlers courtappointed bankruptcy trustee ronald peterson 
said thursday that he proposed a plan for the board of trade to 
cover the debt while he battles a challenge to the payment in 
bankruptcy court 
the chicagobased futures brokerage firm filed for bankruptcy 
liquidation on aug 24 after financial problems surfaced in 
midjuly 
peterson said he believes there is more than enough money to pay 
what is still owed to customers an amount estimated at 23 
million he said he proposed the plan because stotlers debts 
created a black eye in terms of peoples confidence in the 
marketplace and it would be great publicity to do this 
but board of trade officials turned down the plan saying that 
other steps in the legal process should be used 
there appears to be plenty of funds to pay out to customers 
said frederick grede vice president of the board of trade the 
trustee has to get a legal order from the bankruptcy judge to pay 
those funds out

the resolution trust corp has been selling an 
estimated 50 million to 75 million worth of junk bonds weekly 
chipping away at its 29 billion portfolio from failed savings and 
loans 
for the most part the weak junk market has been able to absorb 
the selling without plunging further than it has already on fears 
of a sluggish economy 
there are still buyers in todays market willing to invest in 
what they see has value said joseph bencivenga head of 
highyield or junk bond research at salomon brothers inc 
a number of reasons are offered for the bond markets resilience 
to the rtc sales but many point to the decision by the thrift 
bailout agency to unload the securities slowly 
the rtc has done a good job of metering the flow in the 
beginning people were afraid they would dump hundreds of millions a 
day bencivenga said 
during a slightly busier than normal week the rtc sold about 
70 million worth of bonds tuesday and offered 40 million more 
wednesday market observers said the rtc has been able to avoid a 
great shock to a market that handles 100 million to 200 million 
worth of bonds daily 
when the government announced it would sell assets from failed 
thrifts including highyield bonds many feared the bond sales 
would further depress the market 
junk prices have slumped for most of the past year since 
investors became skittish after the highly leveraged retail empire 
of campeau corp began to come apart 
junk bonds pay higher interest than investmentgrade bonds to 
compensate for the increased risk that the company issuing the 
bonds wont be able to make payments on them 
i think the sales have hurt the market but everyone has long 
since discounted the sales tempering the damage said paul 
getman an economist at regional financial associates inc in west 
chester pa when it first got wind that the rtc was going to be 
seizing thrifts with large junk portfolios the market really fell 
apart 
despite the depressed market the rtc cannot wait for better 
days the agency is in business to get rid of the bonds and other 
assets from failed thrifts and apparently wants to do it before the 
market gets worse 
the value of many of the rtcs bonds is depressed but if the 
economy continues to slow and consumers spend less the companies 
that issued the bonds may have less money to pay interest and 
principal that would push the market value of the bonds down even 
further 
thrift regulators last week blocked columbia savings amp loan from 
selling 3 billion of its junk bonds to a group of investors 
primarily from canada and hong kong regulators apparently feared 
the deal could leave the government holding the bonds if their 
market value declines further 
under the deal the investor group called gordon america lp 
would pay 300 million up front and give columbia a 10year note 
paying 105 percent interest for the remaining 27 billion 
gordon america had an escape route that apparently left 
regulators concerned the government would wind up getting the bonds 
at a price even lower than they are now 
if the value of the bonds fell 10 percent below the purchase 
price the buyers could have walked away from the deal losing 
their down payment but avoiding further losses the bonds would 
then go back to beverly hills califbased columbia and if it 
were seized by regulators to the government 
regulators say they would support an allcash deal in which 
columbia gets rid of the bonds for good

opec marked its 30th anniversary friday 
with its top official predicting the oilproducing organization 
would survive the persian gulf crisis that has badly tarnished its 
image 
a world without opec is unthinkable for as long as oil 
continues to provide the prime source of energy said subroto 
secretarygeneral of the 13nation organization of petroleum 
exporting countries 
opec will stay around we have survived crises before 
surely well survive this also all disputes ultimately get 
resolved he said in an anniversary message carried by the 
groups opecna news agency 
opec was created by saudi arabia venezuela iran iraq and 
kuwait on sept 14 1960 in baghdad iraq in an effort to give 
them more muscle to push up crude prices it has since grown to 13 
nations 
throughout its history the cartel has had to deal with a string 
of crises including iraqs 1980 invasion of neighbor iran 
this time the oil producer moved against another neighbor 
occupying tiny kuwait and creating more turmoil for the cartel 
in his statement subroto said the groups objectives remain 
sound they include coordinating oil policies of member nations 
steadying the world market ensuring a constant flow of oil 
revenues to members and maintaining an adequate supply of crude for 
consumers 
everyone is for a stable oil market he said no one wants 
violent fluctuations in prices 
he said the producing nations do not want a repeat of the 1980s 
when prices went on a rollercoaster ride that carried them to 
almost 40 a barrel before plunging to a little more than 10 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 crude prices have 
soared light sweet crude the benchmark american grade has been 
trading at about 31 a barrel 
a basket of crudes monitored by opec surged last week to 2884 
a barrel well above its target price of 21 dollars that was set 
shortly before the iraqi strike 
subroto who previously was indonesias oil minister said the 
cartel was in a position to meet the crude requirements of 
consuming nations well into the next century 
no one should think otherwise because of the temporary 
difficulties we face today he said 
opec president sadek boussena who is the algerian oil minister 
said producers and consumers can learn from the groups experience 
that what is needed is good will not ill will trust not 
suspicion and cooperation not confrontation 
in addition to the five founding members the group includes 
qatar indonesia libya the united arab emirates algeria 
nigeria ecuador and gabon

keith adams was helping his father unload 
corn on their iowa farm one day but he climbed into the wagon and 
was sucked into the grain as if it were quicksand he suffocated 
keith was 11 
his mother marilyn adams of earlham iowa soon discovered her 
sons tragedy was no freak accident many others had been pulled 
into flowing grain in wagons and bins and suffocated 
mrs adams decided to design decals warning flowing grain 
traps and suffocates victims in seconds and never play in or 
on this wagon 
she also broadened the scope of her crusade and formed farm 
safety for just kids the group produces literature and video tapes 
on farm safety and arranges workshops and school presentations 
farming is one of the nations most dangerous occupations and 
the families of victims of farm tragedies are using their stories 
to warn others and to improve agricultures safety record 
farmers are beginning to change their behavior and attitude 
said mrs adams mom has a reason now to tell dad that johnny is 
not going with him to do something today keeping kids alive is a 
top priority 
farming the nations deadliest job in 1988 improved to second 
place behind mining in 1989 with 42 deaths per 100000 workers 
but the death rate for all industry is nine per 100000 and the 
agriculture statistics do not include 200 to 300 deaths of 
youngsters said larry williams a farm safety expert with country 
companies insurance group 
in addition to 1300 farm deaths 130000 disabling injuries 
occurred last year country companies estimates the loss at 36 
billion 
ralph wier 63 was hurrying to finish his farm chores so he 
could go to the bank but his tractor overturned and crushed him to 
death 
delight wier lost her husband in 1987 her 3yearold son caught 
his leg in a wagon auger in 1958 and died her 12yearold daughter 
fell on an electric fence in 1970 and died 
mrs wier who lives near lacon now writes magazine columns and 
books and stresses safety to other farm families she and son jon 
also practice what they preach on their 1000acre marshall county 
farm 
we have seat belts and rollbars on our tractors and 
slowmoving vehicle signs on all machinery that goes on the 
highway said mrs wier who has taken implement safety courses 
and learned cpr 
accidents happen when farmers are under stress so i insist 
they take breaks she said i dont think itsa favor to take 
food to them in the field they should stop and come in the house 
and rest 
the best rule for farm children is to avoid the dangers from 
mowers to slurry pits 
various reasons for the dangers exist experts cite the vast 
array of heavy machinery and large animals the fatigue associated 
with long hours of work during planting and harvest seasons the 
constant exposure of living at the workplace and the long distance 
to hospitals 
children seem to be attracted to farm equipment because of its 
size and power said williams adding that they also want to help 
their parents 
children are most often injured while riding on machinery with 
an adult farmers are most often killed when their tractors roll 
over and pin them 
solutions can be as simple and inexpensive as not allowing extra 
riders on implements or as costly as the 400 to 1500 to add 
seat belts and rollbars to an older tractor said bob aherin a 
university of illinois farm safety specialist 
he said farmers also are encouraged to attend safety workshops 
now offered in rural communities to read and follow instructions 
in equipment manuals to wear protective clothing and to know 
their limitations 
aherin said a bill in congress would provide 320 million over 
five years to improve farm safety 
the measure would pay for research on health and safety issues 
rehabilitation programs for injured farmers training for rescue 
workers education on farm safety and a national data collection 
system on accidents

neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to wall

a dry summer and the middle east crisis have 
driven britains annual inflation rate up to 106 percent the 
highest rate in more than eight years the government reported 
friday 
the latest inflation rate is 03 percentage points higher than 
the financial markets had expected and is at its highest level 
since february 1982 when it stood at 11 percent 
the figure is also higher than the rate prime minister margaret 
thatcher inherited in 1979 from a labor party government she had 
chastised for loosing control of the economy 
after 11 years in power the government that promised us stable 
prices has delivered us an inflation rate of 106 percent said 
lawmaker john smith the labor partys spokesman on treasury 
matters 
but norman lamont the treasurys chief secretary said on 
british television we will be content at the election to be 
judged on our record our record over the lifetime of this 
government is very much better than what we inherited and you must 
not forget that 
the government blamed the surging inflation on higher oil prices 
caused by the iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait as well as a jump 
in food prices caused by drought 
britain has by far the highest inflation rate among the major 
industrialized nations italys 62 percent rate is second 
the governments forecast that high interest rates would 
moderate inflation by the end of the year now looks doubtful and 
time is running out for mrs thatchers government to find a 
solution before an election is required in mid1992 
inflation has risen steadily even though economic growth has 
declined since mrs thatcher won her third consecutive fiveyear 
term in june 1987 
the governments chosen cure has become as painful as inflation 
with interest rates at 15 percent for a year the number of house 
repossessions has doubled since the second half of 1989 
the problems started when the government lowered interest rates 
in 1988 to prevent a recession after the october 1987 stock market 
crash 
this years inflation outlook will remain clouded by the mideast 
crisis although economists say the worlds economies are better 
prepared to handle oil shocks than they were in the 1970s 
the current problems contrast with the mid1980s when britain 
was enjoying a sustained economic boom and mrs thatcher was 
credited with curing britains economic disease 
inflation which had crested at 219 percent during a recession 
in may 1980 had dropped to a 20year low of 24 percent in july 
1986 
now the socialist labor party considers itself justified in 
criticizing the governments economic policies labor had been 
widely blamed for soaring inflation high interest rates and 
militant unionism in the 1970s 
in august 1975 under a labor government inflation peaked at 
269 percent 
on friday labor spokesman smith blamed the current rise in 
inflation on the goernments massively incompetent economic 
mismanagement 
chancellor of the exchequer john major conceded in radio 
interviews that britains inflation was a good deal higher than 
we would wish to see it but maintained that inflation was not 
out of control 
although some economists and businessmen fear continued high 
interest rates will tip britain into a recession major reiterated 
his commitment to holding interest rates high until he feels 
inflation is defeated 
major declined to say when inflation might peak and when 
interest rates might come down

six weeks after the government froze kuwaits 
us assets to prevent iraq from seizing them kuwaitiowned 
companies in this country say operations are back to normal thanks 
to exemptions granted by the treasury department 
customers and suppliers of santa fe international in alhambra 
calif initially expressed concern about dealing with the 
kuwaitiowned oil drilling company following iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait said vice president john mika 
they wanted assurance that they were not violating any freeze 
order by continuing their relationship with us he said 
but the treasury cooperated quite well with us in granting 
the exemption which allows the company to continue writing checks 
making payroll and otherwise operate normally he said 
at georgetown industries a kuwaitiowned steel company in 
charlotte nc our business is very much business as usual 
said president roger regelbrugge 
we have no other restrictions than that we are not supposed to 
transfer assets to the government of kuwait or to iraq he said 
the hilton hotels corp whose atlanta hotel amp tower is owned by 
the kuwaiti government also has had no problems said spokeswoman 
kendra silverman 
estimates of kuwaits us investments vary widely from under 
10 billion to more than 50 billion because of the nations 
policy of secrecy one investment industry source speaking on 
condition of anonymity said kuwait bars its investment managers 
from speaking publicly about its assets 
a great deal of it is going to be unknown said scott 
rogers a mideast economist at the economic research firm 
drimcgrawhill 
kuwaits overall foreign assets last year totaled an estimated 
124 billion according to drimcgrawhill much of that is in 
europe and includes such highprofile investments as a 14 percent 
stake in daimlerbenz ag the german auto electronics and 
aerospace giant 
santa fe international which stateowned kuwait petroleum corp 
bought for 25 billion in 1981 is believed to be the mideast 
nations largest single us holding 
among kuwaits other us assets are stakes in several hotels a 
bank holdingcompany a real estate investment company and 
undeveloped land along with stock and bond holdings in various 
us companies 
other known kuwaiti government assets in the united states 
according to the new yorkbased newsletter mideast report and other 
sources include 
occidental geothermal inc of los angeles which kuwait 
petroleum corp bought for 350 million in 1984 
about 12 percent of corporate property investors which owns 
real estate in new york as well as a number of shopping malls 
nationwide 
an undetermined stake in first american bankshares inc a 
bank holding company in washington dc 
fortyfive percent of the phoenecian resort in scottsdale 
ariz which was controlled by scandalplagued lincoln savings and 
loan until the federal government took over lincolns share 
fortyfive percent of the crescent hotel in phoenix 
in addition private kuwaiti investors not subject to the 
asset freeze hold an undertermined stake in investcorp which 
owns the saks fifth avenue department stores and other properties 
mideast report estimates kuwaits us assets at 50 billion 
not even the treasury department charged with enforcing the 
asset freeze has a complete accounting of kuwaits us 
investments the department began a list after iraqs invasion but 
had not finished it as of friday a spokeswoman said 
the treasury would not disclose which companies have been 
granted exemptions 
the spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said the 
exemptions were designed to allow the kuwati government to 
conduct its normal business in the smoothest way possible while 
assuring that no benefits accrue to iraq 
the department also has issued general exemptions for categories 
of companies such as telephone and foreign exchange companies 
that meet certain conditions 
according to one measure by the commerce department kuwaits 
direct investments in us companies totaled 42 billion last 
year that figure does not account for investments made through 
intermediaries such as kuwaiti companies not based in kuwait 
nor does it include investments in companies that result in less 
than 10 percent of the voting stock nor kuwaits portfolio 
accounts of stocks bonds and other investments being managed by 
us investment houses 
david t mizrahi editor of mideast report estimates 25 percent 
of kuwaits us assets are held in portfolio accounts at firms 
including jp morgan amp co morgan stanley amp co inc and 
citicorp 
by a broader measure last taken in 1988 the value of all us 
companies in which kuwait held at least 10 percent control totaled 
10 billion 
but since that commerce department figure includes the full 
value of those companies no matter what the size of kuwaits stake 
most likely overstates kuwaits investment 
former treasury secretary g william miller helps manage 
kuwaits us assets mideast report says among kuwaits us 
investment groups is the wafra investment advisory group of new 
york which invests kuwaiti pension funds 
much of kuwaits assets worldwide are managed by the kuwaiti 
investment office in london

corn and wheat futures prices extended their 
losses friday on the chicago board of trade while most soybean 
futures advanced all in a continuing reaction to a recent 
government crop report 
the agriculture department report released wednesday contained 
projections for 1990 us corn and wheat production that were 
higher than the market expected 
the usda also predicted the nations soybean stockpile would 
continue to dwindle due to strong world demand for soybean meal and 
a smaller harvest next spring in brazil the worlds secondlargest 
soybean producer after the united states 
people are getting bullish on the meal and meal exerts a lot 
of influence over soybeans said joel karlin grains analyst with 
research department inc in chicago 
karlin said wheat futures also were pressured by agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutters pledge to oppose an increase in crop 
setaside acreage as a means of stemming a slide in wheat prices 
yeutter told a farmers group in chicago that taking more crop 
acreage out of production would ultimately make the united states 
less competitive in the world market 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in september at 257 a bushel corn was 
cent to 2 cents lower with september at 232 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to cent higher with september at 107 a bushel

industrial production fell 02 percent in 
august its worst performance in four months the government said 
friday in a report analysts said was another indication the 
manufacturing economy remains locked in lethargy 
the industrial side is clearly signalling a slumping 
economy said david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp 
co a new york government securities dealer 
it was the governments first report on factory activity since 
the iraqi invasion of kuwait aug 2 but the manufacturing economy 
had been sluggish long before that growing a meager 15 percent 
over the last year the federal reserve said 
in a companion report the central bank said the operating rate 
of the nations factories mines and utilities which usually 
moves in tandem with industrial production fell 04 percentage 
point to 831 percent the operating rate measures not only output 
but also changes in productivity levels 
its consistent with the other data for example the 
manufacturing employment figures the national association of 
purchasing management index said evalina tainer senior domestic 
economist with the first national bank of chicago it continues 
to show the manufacturing sector is quite sluggish 
the labor department reported last week that 45000 factory jobs 
were lost in august it was the 16th time in 17 months that 
manufacturing jobs declined 
the monthly survey by the purchasing executives last week showed 
the manufacturing sector had slowed in august for the second 
straight month their index was down to 470 percent when the 
index registers below 50 percent it indicates the economy is 
weakening 
in fact economist gordon richards of the national association 
of manufacturers and richard w rahn chief economist with the us 
chamber of commerce said in separate statements the economy may 
have slipped into a recession in august 
only utilities posted a gain in production up 12 percent but 
richards noted the advance was due to electric power and may have 
been little more than a seasonal factor during the 
airconditioning season 
none of the other major components showed a gain 
the manufacturing sector was off 01 percent including a 02 
percent drop in output of durable goods items expected to last 
more than three years nondurable output was unchanged while 
mining production plunged 23 percent 
the fed said its industrial production index in august stood at 
1098 percent of its 1987 base down from 1100 percent in july 
in its capacity utilization report the fed said the operating 
rate at factories producing durable goods fell 04 percentage point 
to 814 percent while the rate at plants making nondurable goods 
slipped 02 percentage point to 838 percent 
the operating rate at mines fell from 897 percent in july to 
878 in august while it gained 1 percentage point to 869 percent 
at utilities

stock prices fell today faced with new signs of 
steppedup inflation and weak consumer spending 
the labor department reported this morning that the producer 
price index of finished goods jumped 13 percent in august mostly 
because of sharp rises in energy prices separately the commerce 
department said retail sales dropped 06 percent 
neither of those figures came as a drastic surprise to wall 
street analysts who have been busy since midsummer trying to 
estimate the possiblefallout from the showdown in the middle east 
and a doubling of world oil prices 
nevertheless analysts said the data served to reinforce fears 
of stagflation a combination of sluggish growth and increased 
inflationary pressures 
in that kind of climate few market participants can see much 
reason for optimism about the outlook for corporate profits and 
dividends

it wasnt the biggest headline of the week but 
the new york stock exchanges approval of extended trading hours 
provided an entry for the history books 
the board of the worlds bestknown stock market put its stamp 
on the first stages of a plan that could lead to roundtheclock 
trading within five to 10 years 
approved were two afterhours trading sessions that will allow 
big market players to execute trades after the nyses closing bell 
at 4 pm eastern time 
up to now such business has been flowing overseas hence the 
motivation for the exchanges unprecedented move 
it was a small step the sessions will only last about an hour 
and are aimed at big stock traders not individuals but the late 
sessions are nevertheless a giant leap for the traditionbound big 
board 
the sessions wont require the services of the socalled 
specialists who manage trading on the floor of the exchange 
during regular business hours the postclose sessions propose to 
match buyers and sellers electronically as they are in london 
the new crossing sessions wont radically alter wall street 
life as the world knows it individual stocks will trade at their 
closing prices 
but later stages of the plan call for stock auctions several 
times a night and then 24hour trading before the year 2000

the troubled advertising giant saatchi amp saatchi 
co plc said friday that martin tucker has been named president and 
chief executive of its holdings in the united states 
tucker formerly the us operations general counsel replaces 
w jonathan t hirst who is resigning to pursue other career 
interests saatchi said 
robert louisdreyfus the chief executive of the londonbased 
parent company said hirst 41 had told him several months ago 
that he wanted to pursue other interests once he had completed the 
sale of the saatchi consulting business and that that task was 
now virtually done 
hirst had been with saatchi for eight years including two as 
head of its us operations 
efforts to reach the three saatchi executives were unavailing 
londonbased saatchi got its start as an advertising company but 
grew rapidly over the past decade branching out into management 
consulting in an effort to offer its advertising and marketing 
clients more services 
but the results from consulting have been poor and the company 
decided to sell its consulting businesses some of them have been 
sold for only a fraction of what saatchi paid for them however 
for the first half of this year saatchi reported it lost about 
134 million mainly reflecting losses on the sale of two 
consulting businesses a week ago the company said its balance 
sheet was too weak to pay a regular dividend 
louisdreyfus said tucker 67 brings many years of experience 
in the advertising business both as a lawyer and executive to 
the new post as president and chief executive of saatchi amp saatchi 
holdings usa inc 
his appointment underscores our companys decision to 
concentrate on its core communications business louisdreyfus 
said 
he said hirst will remain as a consultant to the company to 
complete the previously announced sale of gartner group inc and to 
assist tucker in transition 
gartner is being sold to an investor group for 55 million in 
cash and 15 million in notes and other obligations but saatchi 
paid 86 million for gartner only two years ago 
jonathan hirst has made many outsanding contributions to the 
company during the past eight years not the least of which was the 
sale of the consulting group companies in the difficult business 
and financing conditions of the past year we wish him well for the 
future louisdreyfus said 
saatchi operates the giant ad agencies saatchi amp saatchi 
advertising and backer spielvogel bates worldwide 
in addition it owns the ad agencies campbellmithunesty 
mccaffrey amp mccall acampr and conill advertising it owns public 
relations and design firms a direct marketing agency and several

the dollar finished modestly higher against most 
major foreign currencies in us trading friday after news of a 
flareup in the middle east conflict abruptly reversed a dollar 
slide 
gold prices gained 
initially the dollar moved lower as trading opened in new york 
continuing a trend based on a bearish us economic outlook 
government reports released early in the session confirmed that 
deteriorating economic conditions are being accompanied by rising 
inflation 
the labor department reported that the producer price index 
jumped 13 percent in august due mostly to steep oil price 
increases separately the commerce department said retail sales 
dropped 06 percent 
the figures didnt surprise financial markets but they added to 
a pile of pessimistic economic data 
it is widely expected that the federal reserve board will modify 
its monetary policy to revive growth if the central bank pushes 
down interest rates demand for dollars and dollarbased 
investments would decline 
fed chairman alan greenspan told a congressional committee 
thursday the central bank would be inclined to ease policy if white 
house and congressional negotiators reach a credible agreement on 
cutting the budget deficit 
speculation about imminent fed action intensified friday when 
word circulated that a deficit accord could come over the weekend 
or early next week 
but currency traders put aside their economic concerns when news 
broke that us and australian navy ships had fired warning shots 
halted and then boarded an iraqi tanker in the gulf of oman 
that news plus earlier information about iraqi troops breaking 
into the french embassy residence in kuwait city spurred dollar 
purchases 
investors and speculators typically turn to dollars at times of 
international turmoil since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait the 
dollar periodically has been bid up sharply 
robert gruber senior corporate trader at chemical bank said 
us trading was hectic and volatile before settling down as it 
usually does on fridays 
he said once it became apparent that an actual shooting war 
wasnt breaking out in the mideast the dollar buying subsided 
on foreign exchange markets abroad the dollar lost ground 
against the japanese yen and german mark but weakened vs the 
british pound as it did in new york 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 13655 japanese yen from 
13765 yen at thursdays close it was the lowest closing level

the senate cleared the way friday for action 
on a bill that would require automakers to dramatically increase 
fuel economy 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he hoped 
to have a vote late next week on the bill that would require 
automakers to increase average fuel economy of new cars to 35 miles 
per gallon by 1995 and to 40 miles per gallon by 2001 
supporters contend the higher fuel economy requirements would 
save 28 million barrels of oil a day once they go fully into 
effect but key opponents promised to continue fighting the measure 
on the senate floor 
within hours of the vote transportation secretary samuel 
skinner blasted the legislation as unrealistic irresponsible 
and more important unattainable he said theres no technology 
to achieve the bills goals without making cars smaller 
it should be called the highway fatality bill skinner said 
at a news conference citing a new study by the national highway 
traffic safety administration that concluded a clear link between 
reducing the size of cars and traffic deaths 
the nhtsa study said the introduction of smaller cars over the 
past decade had resulted in an estimated 1340 additional traffic 
deaths annually in singlecar accidents based on those numbers 
nhtsa administrator jerry curry said between 600 and 1140 
additional deaths annually can be expected if automakers try to 
meet the 40 mile per gallon standard 
skinner said automakers had convinced him that the senate bills 
fuel economy goals cant be achieved without substantial weight 
reductions in cars 
weve just had the first inning of this nineinning game 
sen donald riegle dmich said after the senate voted 6828 to 
clear the way for debate 
we hope and intend to win this fight riegle said adding 
that he doubts supporters will get the needed 60 votes to cut off 
debate and bring it to a vote next week 
a similar bill has been introduced in the house but it has yet 
to be taken up by the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich is staunchly opposed to the 
measure 
rep barbara boxer dcalif sponsor of the house bill said 
earlier this week she would try to push the legislation directly on 
the house floor in an effort to bypass dingells committee 
but the senates 6828 vote friday to cut off efforts by riegle 
to keep the measure off the senate floor was an indication of the 
growing support in congress for a measure to reduce us reliance 
on foreign oil a subject in the spotlight since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
its the single most important step to reducing our dependency 
on opec oil and curbing global warming the sierra club said of 
the bill sponsored by sen richard bryan dnev 
in floor debate riegle said those fuel savings arent likely to 
begin phasing in until 1995 and a better response to todays oil 
crisis might be to return to a national speed limit of 55 miles an 
hour 
later a riegle aide said the senator didnt necessarily support 
a change in the speed limit 
bryan described his bill as a message to detroit and the 
automakers that theyre going to have to look at fuel economy and 
not just muscle cars 
it does not take a crystal ball to realize that if we dont 
start conserving now some future president may have to consider 
sending our young men and woman back to the deserts of the middle 
east he said

brennan took the helm from michael bozic formerly chairman and 
chief executive of the merchandise division bozic was reassigned 
to a new position as president of the group and assumed 
reponsibility for logistics and the groups catalog

after the summer slide wall street has been 
through many an investor might be tempted to go scavenging for 
bargains in the stock market 
but even though stock prices have been marked down sharply wall 
street analysts remain leery of pronouncing them cheap just yet 
by most traditional measures stocks are now well below the 
extremes of valuation they reached at past peaks 
most analysts agree that atmosphere of restrain lessens the 
chances of anything resembling a repeat of the crash of 1987 when 
the market lost more than a third of its value in a span of less 
than two months 
at the same time they say readings on most of the gauges they 
monitor still stand well above the levels that showed up at market 
bottoms in the past 
the world equity markets toward the end of august were very 
close to panic point oversold extreme selling climax or whatever 
you want to call it said barton biggs at morgan stanley amp co 
still biggs added measures of things like investor sentiment 
and market momentum are not yet at bearmarket bottom extremes 
and it will probably take at least a few more months for them to 
get there 
one of the most common standards applied to market values is 
priceearnings ratios a simple computation of how much investors 
are willing to pay for stocks in relation to the current annual 
earnings of the company or companies involved 
pe multiples for the various market averages and indexes 
recently have hovered in the 125 to 15 range well below the 
readings of 20 or more that have been attained in past periods of 
exuberance but still far from the singledigit lows of the 1970s 
and early 1980s 
similarly dividend yields for stocks overall in the area of 
38 percent to 39 percent are in the normal range and 
neutral as described by norman fosback in the investment 
advisory letter market logic 
a similar picture emerges from a comparison of stock prices 
among the issues in standard amp poors industrial index versus the 
corresponding companies book value or theoretical worth if those 
enterprises were to be liquidated and the proceeds distributed to 
shareholders 
by the reckoning of michael metz and norman weinger at 
oppenheimer amp co the sampp industrials recently traded at around 
250 percent of book value down from 285 percent in august 1987 
whether the market is now cheap or dear depends to some extent 
on ones perspective and on comparisons with other assets 
including debt instruments metz and weinger report 
valuations still arent bargains by historical standards 
mitigating this consideration however is the fact that the book 
value of many companies is now more conservatively stated due to 
the huge writeoffs of obsolete and underperforming assets in recent 
years 
however attractive stocks prices may have become investors 
showed little appetite for them in the past week the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials fell 5544 to 256411 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 336 to 
17415 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 596 to 37442 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 232 at 32145 
volume on the big board averaged 12392 million shares a day 
against 11574 million the week before 
market barometers at neutral levels provide a little something 
for everyone since forecasters can use them to support either a 
bullish or a bearish case 
they can also be cited as a reason to sit tight concludes 
standard amp poors corp in its weekly publication the outlook 
although wed maintain sound longterm holdings conditions 
remain too unstable to justify bargainhunting at this time

as america feels increasing pangs from the 
latest oil crisis the natural gas industry sees an opportunity to 
grow 
increased use of natural gas will keep us from sending the 
money over to saddam hussein and other arabs contended robert a 
hefner iii a leading gas explorer from oklahoma city 
supporters say natural gas is cheaper and cleaner with a 
plentiful supply in north america thats free of supply disruptions 
caused by mideast political strife more than 90 percent of the gas 
used in this country is produced domestically with most of the 
rest from canada 
while oil prices have shot up in chaotic trading since iraq 
invaded kuwait pushing up the cost of gasoline and home heating 
oil natural gas has moved up only in a predictable response to the 
coming cold season 
with oil trading above 30 per barrel the cost of an equivalant 
amount of natural gas 6000 cubic feet is about 9 
natural gas now has about 24 percent of the energy market and 
the american gas association has its sights set on a 28 percent 
market share by the year 2010 
uncertainty from the iraqi invasion has prompted gas producers 
to push themselves even harder lately through advertising and 
lobbying 
the aga says some 20 new pipeline projects that now await 
regulatory approval could quickly cut the need for foreign oil by 
bringing more gas into three regions the northeast florida and 
california the industry says demand for gas in those areas is 
greater than the current infrastructure can support 
we could replace roughly 160000 barrels a day within 60 
days said michael german senior vice president with aga we 
could displace 480000 barrels a day within a year we could 
displace 13 million barrels a day within five years 
energy secretary james watkins told the senate energy committee 
on thursday that the government would seek faster ways to cut 
through the red tape 
watkins however offered more modest figures for the amount of 
oil that could be replaced he put the figure at 55000 barrels per 
day by 1991 300000 barrels by 1992 and 600000 barrels by 1994 
there is also strong opposition to some proposed pipelines by 
local groups who claim construction of the underground lines would 
damage the environment some are also afraid of leaks and 
accidents although the industry claims transporting natural gas is 
safer than moving other kinds of fuel 
automobiles present another frontier for natural gas it can 
power cars more cleanly and at about 70 cents per gallon the 
industry says compared to prices of more than 125 lately for a 
gallon of gasoline 
but its limited use keeps startup costs high at present 
natural gas is being tried mostly by motor fleets in the united 
states although some people envision the day when consumers will 
drive natural gas cars that are filled up overnight by machines set 
up in the garage 
hefner views natural gas as the logical successor to oil the 
same way oil replaced coal as the fuel driving the nation this 
century he would like to speed things along by imposing a 1 per 
gallon tax on gasoline to force consumers to pay the entire cost of 
their fuel 
as he sees it the government is propping up a dying oil 
industry though such multibilliondollar acts as the deployment of 
troops to the persian gulf and the storage of crude in the us 
strategic petroleum reserve 
if the oil companies or the producers had to pay the bill to 
ensure the free flow of oil they couldnt pay the bill hefner 
said 
the aga however is not ready to endorse a gasoline tax 
although its members would benefit 
it at least targets oil which is an imported product 
german said

the world bank will loan 
argentina 1 billion in coming months to aid the countrys economic 
and social restructuring a bank official said friday 
world bank first vice president moeen qureshi said the loans 
will help finance reforming argentinas state sector reorder 
government relations with provinces and develop programs in the 
housing health and public education 
we hope that in the next six months we can bring forward at 
least some of these programs qureshi said he did not specify 
precisely how the 1 billion would be spent or when 
president carlos menems 14monthold government is selling 
state companies paring public employment curtailing subsidies 
hiking public service rates and shutting down moneylosing public 
banks 
the government already has eliminated price and currency 
exchange controls partially deregulated the oil industry 
increased foreign currency reserves narrowed the fiscal deficit 
and proposed to reform the tax code and make the central bank 
independent of the government 
i think the turnaround they have made in the fiscal area is 
quite impressive qureshi said 
in the process however social services have declined markedly 
schools operate sporadically because of boycotts by teachers 
demanding higher pay public hospitals barely have enough funds for 
food let alone medicine 
the austerity measures also have contributed to recession real 
wages have shrunk and tens of thousands of people have been thrown 
out of work and are unlikely to find jobs in the private sector 
apart from the new 1 billion loan qureshi said the bank has 
approved 44 billion in loans to argentina since 1961 and 
argentina has repaid 1 billion another 1 billion has been 
approved but not disbursed he said and argentina is in the 
process of repaying 24 billion

the gold market remains sensitive to developments in the middle 
east but to a lesser extent than in the early days of the conflict 
analysts said friday after gold posted modest gains amid unsettling 
news from the region 
on other commodity markets friday crude oil futures rose 
grains and soybeans were mixed and livestock and meat futures were 
mixed 
gold futures settled 220 to 230 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in september at 
38510 a troy ounce silver was 23 cents to 3 cents lower with 
september at 475 a troy ounce 
gold rallied strongly at midday on news that american troops 
fired a warning shot at an iraqi tanker and then boarded it briefly 
in the first instance of us forces boarding an iraqi ship 
but the gains were quickly scaled back despite higher crude oil 
and lower stock prices two factors that have tended to support 
gold during the 6weekold conflict 
higher oil prices suggest the us inflation level could rise 
prompting investors to buy gold as an inflation hedge 
to a certain degree gold is divorcing itself from the action 
in crude said bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with 
painewebber inc in new york 
analyst bette raptopoulos of prudentialbache securities said 
gold had responded very tepidly to fridays 69 centsabarrel 
jump in crude oil prices 
the labor departments report of a 13 percent rise in wholesale 
prices last month provided little support to inflationsensitive 
gold the analysts said because the number was within 
expectations 
savaiko said gold is near the top of its recent trading range 
which runs from about 370 to 390 an ounce and some traders are 
reluctant to buy until the market shows it has enough strength to 
go above 390 
he said gold also may have been held back by weakness in silver 
prices a function of abundant supplies and by selling linked to 
the expiration of october gold options 
on the new york mercantile exchange light sweet crude oil 
settled 30 cents to 69 cents higher with october at 3176 a 
barrel heating oil was 74 cent lower to 74 cent higher with 
october at 8279 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 3 cents 
lower to 25 cent higher with october at 9036 cents a gallon 
corn and wheat futures extended their losses on the chicago 
board of trade while most soybean futures advanced mostly in a 
continuing reaction to wednesdays government crop report 
the agriculture department report contained higher than expected 
estimates of 1990 us corn and wheat production and predicted the 
nations soybean stockpile would continue to dwindle 
joel karlin grains analyst with research department inc in 
chicago said wheat futures also were pressured by agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutters pledge to oppose an increase in crop 
setaside acreage as a means of stemming a slide in wheat prices 
yeutter told a farmers group in chicago that taking more crop 
acreage out of production would ultimately make the united states 
less competitive in the world market 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 4 cents lower with september 
at 257 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents lower with september 
at 232 a bushel oats were unchanged to cent higher with 
september at 107 a bushel soybeans were cent lower to 3 cents 
higher with september at 624 a bushel 
pork futures rose sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange 
boosted by higher than expected cash hog prices cattle futures 
ended mixed 
live cattle settled 23 cent lower to 35 cent higher with 
october at 7862 cents a pound feeder cattle were 13 cent to 55 
cent higher with september at 8875 cents a pound live hogs were 
30 cent to 125 cents higher with october at 5187 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 143 cents to 165 cents higher with

carl icahn usually associated with bidding wars 
in takeover battles won a bid of a different sort in an auction 
for a division of integrated resources inc 
icahn won an auction in us bankruptcy court here for american 
property investors a real estate holding company of integrated 
resources the takeover strategist bid 44 million for the company 
topping a 435 million offer by investor meshulam riklis and other 
bidders 
the purchase of american property investors represents an 
expansion into the real estate business for icahn he has other 
real estate properties including bayswater realty taken over in 
1979 after a proxy fight but heretofore has been more involved in 
corporate investment and takeover bids than real estate 
we want to get into the real estate business in a large way 
icahn said in a telephone interview friday there might be a lot 
of good investments at this point everyone is selling and it might 
be a good time to buy 
american property investors is the general partner and 10 
percent owner of american real estate partners lp which owns 
some 300 real estate properties 
by buying the general partner icahn would have control over its 
properties however if he were to sell the assets the lions 
share of the proceeds 90 percent would go to other partners 
the winning bid does not necessarily seal the deal icahn must 
still provide details of how he will finance the purchase and 
bankruptcy court judge howard buschman will consider objections to 
the sale by another losing bidder oppenheimer amp bigelow income 
fund i 
however integrated chairman stephen weinroth said in an 
interview friday that buschman told the parties he hasnt seen 
any compelling theories to hold up the transaction 
the proceeds from the sale will go to integrated which is 
undergoing reorganization after filing for chapter 11 protection 
from its creditors in february 
integrated sought bankruptcy court protection after some of its 
creditors balked at restructuring more than 16 billion in debt 
the company had tried to build a financial services empire with 
about 800 million in junkbond financing provided by drexel 
burnham lambert inc but was unable to meet the high interest 
payments due on the debt 
integrateds filing for bankruptcy court protection came within 
hours of drexels parent seeking the same protection 
icahn the chairman of trans world airlines is best known for 
his takeover attempts which included unsuccessful runs at texaco 
inc and usx corp in may he lost a ballot at the usx annual 
meeting calling on the steel and energy conglomerate to spin off 
its us steel subsidiary 
but icahn did not indicate he was getting out of investing in 
companies 
i think there are some good corporate investments still he 
said friday but added i think there are some very good real 
estate investments

brothers inc but it still looks like we are forming a base 
unleaded gasoline and home heating oil closed lower for near 
months which trader ed kevelson of dean witter reynolds inc 
attributed to adequate supplies of those products on the cash

the oil markets intially shot up friday morning on news that 
iraqi troops had stormed into the french ambassadors home in 
kuwait capturing the french military attache and three other 
french citizens 
it was the first time bagdads occupying forces have seized 
anybody in a raid on the diplomatic community said brian tagler 
a shearson broker 
the military attache was later released and although the fates 
of the other frenchmen were not immediately known the markets were 
calmed when president bush said the tense situation did not appear 
to be moving any closer to armed conflict 
later in the day crude moved back up on news that a soviet 
pipeline might cut its capacity hittle said earlier prices had 
been buoyed by news that a north sea pipeline was cutting capacity 
by 15 percent 
kevelson said the rise in crude prices was also attributable in 
part to indications that the saudis might be cutting back on their 
production of sweet crude sweet crude with a low sulfur content 
is best suited to us refineries 
youre stetting up for possible sweet crude shortages in the 
future kevelson said 
oils record high of 3235 on the merc was set aug 2 1983 
and matched during the latest persian gulf crisis on aug 23

banning the firm from trading on the exchange said spokesman mark

announced a 42 percent fare increase for domestic flights 
effective oct 1 blaming the increase in higher fuel prices from 
the persian gulf crisis

carriers to impose a second increase in fares since iraq invaded 
kuwait delta air lines on thursday announced a 42 percent 
increase while pan american world airways and alaska air have also 
announced fare hikes most to take effect oct 1 
the increase comes on top of a 53 percent increase that nearly 
all domestic airlines imposed aug 30 due to higher jet fuel 
costs 
usair said the cost of jet fuel has periodically risen more than 
30 cents per gallon above the average price of 585 cents per 
gallon in the second quarter of this year 
each 1 cent increase in fuel costs translates to 13 million in 
annual costs for the carrier the company said

striking bus drivers shouldnt benefit from a 
bankruptcy they caused greyhound lines inc claimed friday in 
asking a bankruptcy judge to move the union to the bottom of its 
list of creditors 
in a complaint filed as part of its bankruptcy case greyhound 
attacked a multimilliondollar claim for back pay sought by members 
of the amalgamated transit union who went on strike march 2 
greyhound does not believe it will have to pay the strikers 
anything but the carrier said friday that if it does end up 
paying the union members should have to get in line after the 
other creditors 
the strike has injured the creditors of greyhound and to that 
effect because the tactics used by the union were violence which 
is illegal those tactics should not be able to benefit the union 
members ahead of the creditors said rosemary m collyer an 
attorney for the company 
the union has attempted to devalue greyhound to the point it 
could buy the only nationwide intercity bus company said collyer 
former general counsel of the national labor relations board 
the atu will oppose greyhounds complaint as it presses ahead 
with efforts to collect the back pay atu general counsel earle 
putnam said the back pay has been accumulating at between 2 
million and 3 million a week since may 27 five days after the 
drivers offered to return to work 
greyhound has been operating with replacement drivers and union 
members who crossed the picket line the company said that even if 
it loses the back pay probably would not come to more than 8 
million based on a study of recent nlrb awards 
greyhounds complaint filed in us bankruptcy court in corpus 
christi is a move to erase the largest uncertainty it now faces 
the company which hopes to emerge from bankruptcy by mid1991 
has until oct 2 to file a reorganization plan but has asked for 
an extension until nov 19 
the size of the potential back pay claim has made devising a 
reorganization plan more difficult so greyhounds latest move 
attempts to negate and minimize it 
an administrative law judge on nov 19 plans to hear testimony 
on an nlrb unfair labor practices charge that says greyhound 
improperly hired replacements after the 6300 bus drivers went on 
strike if greyhound loses that case it could be liable for the 
back pay 
greyhound filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from 
creditors on june 4 after failing to meet debt payments company 
spokesman george gravley said the strike has cost greyhound more 
than 50 million 
fridays filing by greyhound accused the union of plotting to 
get in line ahead of other creditors 
thats ludicrous on its face putnam said 
greyhounds complaint and other documents compiled by the 
company claim the union planned as early as last fall to drive the 
company into bankruptcy 
between nov 2 1989 and march 1 1990 the union planned 
and advocated a violent strike to achieve the acquisition of 
greyhound by the union or to drive greyhound into bankruptcy 
in order to obtain increased pay and other benefits at the 
expense of other creditors 
the company has compiled a white paper and videotape on 
strike violence using information uncovered in gathering evidence 
for a 30 million racketeering lawsuit filed in florida against the 
union and some of its leaders

the dutch electronics giant nv 
philips refused to comment friday on a report that it was pulling 
out of a multimilliondollar telecommunications project with atampt 
het financieele dagblad an authoritative dutch business 
newspaper said philips is planning to sell its 15 percent stake in 
atampt network systems international which develops and manufactures 
public telephone exchanges 
a philips spokesman refused to comment on the report saying the 
company would make an announcement only if and when it saw fit an 
american telephone amp telegraph co spokesman in the united states 
tom harris also said he had no comment on the report 
the newspaper added that philips would limit itself after the 
pullout to making only industrial telecommunications equipment 
including corporate switchboards 
philips share in the project with atampt was estimated by the 
newspaper at 100 million that would place the total worth of the 
joint venture at 666 million 
the report said atampt would absorb 9 percent of philips share 
while 6 percent would be taken over by telefonica sa a spanish 
telecommunications company 
but harris the atampt spokesman said that report was incorrect 
though telefonica announced friday it was buying a 6 percent stake 
in atampt network systems international he said that stake came out 
of atampts share in the venture 
after the telefonica transaction atampt will own 59 percent of 
the venture down from 65 percent harris said 
italys statecontrolled stet owns the other 15 percent 
atampt nsi the us companys main european operation produces 
software and hardware products for most of europes public 
telecommunications networks 
at a special shareholders meeting in july philips announced it 
was beginning a major restructuring to streamline its operations 
the announcement followed unexpectedly low firstquarter profit 
of 34 million down from 126 million in the first quarter last 
year 
philips president jan timmer warned at the meeting to expect 
more than 1 billion in losses and up to 10000 layoffs 
timmer was appointed last may in a widely publicized boardroom 
reshuffle and is reputed to be a ruthless costcutter 
philips which began as a small light bulb factory has grown to 
be one of the worlds biggest manufacturers of consumer 
electronics computers and other appliances but has been facing 
fierce competition from japanese companies 
meanwhile friday telefonica said it had reached an agreement to 
take the 6 percent stake in atampt nsi in exchange for its 20 percent 
share in a spanish microchip company 
in a joint statement statecontrolled telefonica said it was 
swapping its 20 percent share in atampt microelectronica sa for the 
stake in netherlandsbased atampt nsi 
atampt nsi will now own 100 percent of atampt microelectronica 
which in 1985 built a 200 million custom microchip factory just 
north of madrid 
telefonica president candido velazquez called the accord an 
important step in the growing process of internationalization of 
telefonica permitting us to directly participate in a european 
project like att nsi 
atampt president robert allen said the agreement permits us to 
widen our european perspectives and strengthen our position as a 
global company 
earlier friday atampt network systems espana presented a new 
100 million factory which will provide 250000 telephone lines to 
telefonica through 1990 and 300000 lines in 1991
