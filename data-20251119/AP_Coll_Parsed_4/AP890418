a former police officer whose acquittal on 
brutality charges sparked riots here in 1980 and who was recently 
arrested on drug charges has been linked to a huge brushfire that 
shrouded miami officials said tuesday 
alex marrero 34 has been connected to charred documents found 
at the source of the 12000acre blaze that began april 8 in 
western dade county said joe subic an investigator for the state 
department of agriculture 
police suspect the burning of the documents may have been 
connected with marreros arrest in a sting operation although 
marrero himself could not have set the fire the records were set 
on fire with gasoline subic said 
the charred documents were from eastern security and 
investigations inc in miami which marrero owned and operated 
subic said the fire broke out only hours after marrero and drug 
enforcement administration agent jorge villar were arrested on 
cocaine distribution and bribery charges 
he couldnt have set the fire himself because he was in jail 
at the time subic said 
the investigator speculated that marrero could have passed an 
order to an associate that the records be burned 
arson charges will be brought against whoever started the fire 
the florida division of forestry will be billing alex for the 
cost of the fire he said estimating the cost at upwards of 
100000 
state and federal firefighters worked for more than three days 
to battle the blaze which with the help of shifting winds april 
11 sent a blanket of thick white smoke over downtown miami and 
much of south florida 
the flames forced the evacuation of 745 detainees held at the 
federal krome avenue detention center 
marrero and villar were arrested april 8 they are accused of 
providing protection for a cocaine shipment that actually was an 
undercover operation and face up to life in prison if convicted 
in 1980 marrero and three other officers were acquitted of 
charges they beat black insurance executive arthur mcduffie to 
death after a chase triggering bloody riots

a powerful 17member board should be 
established to govern higher education in louisiana as a means of 
better desegregating the states colleges and universities a 
courtappointed official said tuesday 
the suggestion was included in a longawaited 137page report 
by paul verkuil president of the college of william and mary who 
was appointed after black leaders educators and politicians were 
unable to reach an agreement to end a longrunning desegregation 
lawsuit 
the report brought the state a step closer to ending a legal 
battle that began when the us justice department filed a lawsuit 
in 1974 a threejudge federal panel that appointed verkuil will 
have the final say 
verkuils report marked a victory for gov buddy roemer who has 
been urging the legislature to establish a single board to replace 
the four bodies that currently oversee higher education in the 
state 
verkuil also said the state should make louisiana state 
university at baton rouge the major research undergraduate and 
postgraduate institution in the state with the toughest admission 
standards in louisiana 
twelve other fouryear institutions would be divided among a 
second and third tier of schools with less stringent admission 
standards and fewer postgraduate programs 
admission standards at all universities are virtually open to 
everyone now 
in recommending a single higher education board verkuil went 
against the wishes of black leaders who feared the board would be 
insensitive to the needs of louisianas two major predominantly 
black universities grambling state university in north louisiana 
and the southern university system based in baton rouge 
grambling is governed by the board of regents and board of 
trustees which oversees most of the predominantly white 
institutions southern has its own governing board 
an attorney for southern was light in his criticism of the 
recommendation 
for the historically black universities it could have been 
worse said william jefferson a democratic state senator from 
new orleans who is a leader of the legislative black caucus 
jefferson was pleased with verkuils suggestion that a 
percentage of the state budget be reserved for enhancement of 
grambling and southern although verkuil didnt recommend a 
percentage or a dollar amount

change comes slowly down the twolane 
highway that winds through forests dairy farms and cattle barns 
into greensburg 
its taken four decades for desegregation to reach the seat of 
st helena parish and even now a visitor looking for john halls 
house behind the masonic lodge is asked you talking about the 
white masonic hall or the black one 
this parish hasnt changed since 1907 education has been 
what kept it like it is said hall a construction worker who has 
spent 37 of his 70 years fighting to give black students 
including his 14 children a chance 
hall filed suit in 1952 after being told that the school 
district didnt have money to furnish a black school ironically 
segregation ended because the district couldnt afford to keep it 
going this semester is the first in st helena parish with all 
black and white students under the same roof 
under a plan approved in december by us district judge john 
parker in baton rouge classes were consolidated into three 
buildings including one that hall and other black residents built 
in the early 1950s 
im not trying to take credit for anything hall said i 
wanted my children to get an education and thats what they got 
st helena parish has one of louisianas poorest school 
districts about 95 percent of the parishs annual 65 million 
budget comes from the state until jan 6 its 2040 students 70 
percent of them black attended seven schools 
there is no question the st helena parish school board has 
been operated in violation of the us constitution parker said 
in december adding that consolidation means desegregation will 
be accomplished 
he said some of the schools are not fit for a dog house 
superintendent perry p spears said all seven were substandard 
spears who is black and went to school here plans to do away with 
a fifth school and is working to float a 75 million bond issue 
this fall to improve the remaining two 
i enjoyed my elementary and high school career in st helena 
but at the same time i knew that we were not being supported 
equally he said 
the point was driven home for spears when he became 
superintendent three years ago and saw that white schools had 
equipment like washing machines and dryers for the athletic 
programs the black schools did not 
back in the early 1950s black students often sat on soft drink 
cases boxes and pieces of logs to listen to a teacher who didnt 
have enough supplies or even a chair to sit down on hall said 
these schools were as bad as anything youve ever seen i dont 
know why theyd send children up here to get an education at a 
place like that id rather put them under a tree 
in 1952 he asked the board for a new black school officials 
told him there wasnt enough money but they made a deal build 
the school yourself and the parish will furnish it the black 
community pitched in their meager assets and their elbow grease to 
build a new school hall returned to complete the deal and was 
told there was no money for furnishings 
i told him right then that im going to take my children up 
there to go to school with the white folks he said he took 
him a good laugh he and his crew had a big funmaking deal about 
it i understand 
hall didnt laugh he his father and two other black residents 
who still want to remain anonymous went to ap tureaud an 
attorney for the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
they said youre going to have some mad white folks here 
hall said i said i was already mad despite the warning he 
said the black residents faced nothing more than talk all kinds 
of threats and talk 
although the supreme court outlawed segregated schools in 1954 
halls suit and scores of other desegregation cases floated in the 
courts for years 
in the 1960s st helena parish built a modern black high 
school a few blacks started going to white greensburg high school 
and a few whites attended classes in the black schools it was 
all token desegregation hall said 
segregation hurt both black and white students he said you 
cant hold back one race without holding the other back 
over the years running seven schools used up the parishs 
allotment of statesupported teacher salaries and resulted in 
duplication of basic classes as a result few advanced classes 
were offered and the students suffered 
we have not been able to offer a comprehensive curriculum 
spears said i feel that was the biggest disadvantage we had over 
the years 
under consolidation elementary school students eat lunch in a 
makeshift cafeteria set up in an old gymnasium and some attend 
class in trailers head start pupils still go to the cramped 
building that black residents built 
most opposition came from parents spears said they have 
caused a problem by letting their kids see how much they oppose 
consolidation i dont think our kids generally oppose 
consolidation 
in fact students give consolidation a mixed review 
its going on pretty well now said pamecia foskey a black 
senior its all coming together were thinking of it as one 
school 
itll probably be better next year but i wont be around to 
find out said kelly smith a white sophomore who is going to 
private school in mississippi next fall 
its gone better than everybody thought said deann fugler 
a white sophomore who also plans to go to private school its 
too crowded right now if the facility gets better i might come 
back its hard to tell 
about 150 students mostly white have enrolled in private 
schools or are illegally attending public schools in other 
parishes spears said 
he is enthusiastic about the future especially if the bond 
issue passes 
i think that the community is going to have more pride in its 
schools we wont have that competition between schools the 
competition is because we had allwhite and allblack schools 
a recent high school basketball game was an example of what 
spears hopes will become the rule it was obvious that these were 
kids that had never been brought together before the support was 
like we hadnt had before its now oneandone i feel good about 
it its going to be a family relationship 
hall who thought his lawsuit would be settled in four or five 
years isnt so sure it will be slow slow the chance for 
change will have to come with the new generation not with none of 
the ones who are here now

enraged by jealousy dong lu chen smashed his 
wifes skull he was tried and convicted and placed on five 
years probation by a judge who agreed with defense arguments that 
his guilt was mitigated by his traditional chinese values 
the result was a tempest denunciations by groups representing 
asians and women threats by the local chapter of the national 
organization for women to file a complaint with the state 
commission on judicial conduct charging the judge with bias and 
prejudice an announcement that prosecutors would review the case 
for grounds of appeal 
theres just no basis for a judge to give this kind of 
sentence based on a culture there is a role for cultural 
considerations in some instances but not in a case where a man has 
killed his wife said margaret fung executive director of the 
asian american legal defense and education fund 
chen 51 could have been sentenced to five to 15 years on his 
seconddegree manslaughter conviction 
chen his wife gian wan and their two teenage children came 
to new york from canton china three years ago and found life 
difficult according to testimony in order to get a job the former 
farmer had to leave his family in new york and go to maryland where 
he worked for eight months as a dishwasher 
when he came home during those months chens 41yearold wife 
refused to have sex with him and he suspected she was seeing 
another man 
in a tearful confession chen told police that on the morning of 
sept 7 1987 he accused his wife of infidelity she did not deny 
the allegation enraged he attacked her with a hammer in their 
brooklyn home and crushed her skull with eight blows 
at chens fiveday nonjury trial hunter college 
anthropologist burton pasternak testified that the chinese hold 
marriage to be sacred the defense expert said a chinese man could 
reasonably be expected to become enraged upon learning of his 
wifes infidelity 
however a spokesman with the chinese consulate in new york yao 
shan vhou said that in todays china such rage would not justify 
the crime and a husband could be charged with murder 
if he killed a person he must be held responsible for it 
its only common sense the spokesman said 
at the march 30 sentencing state supreme court justice edward 
pincus said chen had already spent enough time in jail for the 
killing 18 months and said cultural considerations warranted 
the light sentence 
pincus noted the effect of his wifes behavior on someone who 
is essentially born in china raised in china and took all his 
chinese customs with him to the united states 
chens cultural background made him more susceptible to 
cracking under the circumstances pincus said 
while some asian women interviewed gave pincus credit for trying 
to be sensitive to foreign traditions all agreed his leniency 
showed he was misdirected and had no understanding of modern asian 
law and culture 
we were really alarmed by the sentencing and the image it 
sends to nonasians that asian cultures sanction wife killing 
which is not true said monona yin cochairwoman of the 
committee against antiasian violence 
ms yin and others said the sentencing sent a potentially more 
harmful message to immigrant women that the us justice system 
wont protect them 
feminist leaders said adultery cannot justify reducing the value 
of a life 
it was unjust and it degrades womens position back to no more 
than a commodity that could be bought or sold or done away with 
said doris koo director of the civilrights organization 
asianamericans for equality 
last week pincus clerk said the judge would not talk about the 
case earlier pincus told new york newsday that chen is not a 
loose cannon this guys not going to do it again and he has 
suffered 
pincus also said the state probation department recommended 
probation because chen had shown remorse

a watch made from a meteorite and a 
diamondcovered timepiece whose 14 million pricetag was out of 
this world are among the timely attractions at this years watch 
clock and jewelry fair 
the 1860 exhibitors from 16 european countries the united 
states japan hong kong and singapore are in basel until wednesday 
to show off their latest collections 
its also a time when manufacturers take stock of new trends 
the consensus this year among watch manufacturers was that 
consumers are willing to pay higher prices for a watch perceived as 
unique 
there has been a clear change in consumer behavior said 
klaus wehner president of the german watch industry the average 
price has increased and a watch is no longer just an instrument to 
tell time it is a fashion accessory 
one that fell into that category was a solid gold watch covered 
in diamonds that is priced at 14 million its nearly impossible 
to see its hands through all the sparkle but one visitor observed 
its a watch for people who dont need to know what time it is 
one swiss manufacturer displayed watches with faces it said were 
made from a meteorite discovered in greenland in 1894 by the 
american explorer robert peary who later went on to discover the 
north pole the company said it only had enough meteorite to make 
900 watches so the series would be limited 
swiss watchmakers said mechanical watches were making a comeback 
among wealthy consumers although quartz brands outnumbered them by 
nearly 51 last year 
swiss companies displayed complicated mechanical watches at the 
fair many with intricately carved movements visible through a 
transparent back 
the major technological innovation was a clock powered by 
ultrasonic waves the timepiece was invented by japans akira 
kumada and takahiko iochi who teamed up with a swiss company 
the clock face is made of two glass discs that represent the 
hour hand and minute hand and which rotate at controlled speeds 
when hit by ultrasonic waves a microprocessor in the 
futuristiclooking clock regulates the frequency of the waves 
by the end of the year the company plans to produce 1000 small 
and large ultrasonic clocks ranging in price from 1500 to 
10000 
another innovation aimed at lefthanded people the 
handicapped and women with long fingernails had no stem for 
setting the time instead the wearer presses on the watch crystal 
to move the hands 
jewelry designers noted a trend toward using more platinum 
following the japanese lead 
the trend is likely to take root elsewhere as french jeweler 
charles abouchar put it the japanese like platinum and if they 
like it it will be around for a while

portauprince haiti ap the revolt against haitis leader 
lt gen prosper avril after he fired four ranking officers linked 
to drug running illustrates the depth of army involvement in the 
illegal trade 
washington says this impoverished caribbean nation has become a 
major transit point in the past three years for drugs mainly 
colombian cocaine on the way to the united states 
although cocaine seizures in haiti in 1988 doubled from the 
previous year to nearly 1 tons according to a state department 
corruption is a problem and the judicial system is weak haitis 
long coastline and mountainous interior also facilitate smuggling 
avril has dismissed or retired more than 140 officers many 
suspected of drug trafficking since soldiers put him in power in 
september after ovrthrowing lt gen henri namphy 
since avril came to office haitian cooperation has increased 
tremendously a us diplomat said but the biggest problem 
remains the corruption of the army the willingness of certain 
officers to transship drugs from incoming boats to outgoing 
planes at isolated ports and airstrips 
us officials have made a crackdown on narcotics traffic a 
condition for restoring 70 million in aid suspended after the 
november 1987 election was canceled when thugs killed 34 voters 
it is common in haiti for a captain or major whose pay is 900 a 
month to drive a mercedes and live in a wealthy suburb 
the success of drugrunning here is due to low army salaries 
cheap raw material and huge profits a western european diplomat 
said one thousand dollars worth of cocaine can arrive here from 
south america and sell in the us for 100000 
contraband and other rackets also are widespread among the 7000 
men of haitis army a diplomat said to crack down on drugs and 
contraband in the haitian army would be like a snake devouring its 
own tail avril has no choice but the americans are making him go 
too fast 
avril narrowly escaped a coup april 2 led by four army officers 
loyal soldiers rescued him at the airport where he had been taken 
in handcuffs to be deported 
a government statement blamed the plot on opponents of his 
vast campaign against drug trafficking contraband and 
corruption 
last week two army units rebelled the 750 men of the 
dessalines barracks adjacent to the presidential palace and the 
elite 400member leopards batallion avrils 1100man presidential 
guard smashed the uprising in a twoday assault on the dessalines 
barracks 
rebels in the dessalines a notoriously repressive unit 
expressed anger at what they considered avrils arbitrary 
dismissals of the four officers 
col jeanclaude paul former dessalines commander was indicted 
on drug charges early last year in miami and died in november 
poisoned soup was said to have killed him 
a foreign military expert said paul was popular with his men 
because he spread drug money around he was like their 
godfather 
avril dismissed the four officers the day after a visit to haiti 
by richard melton a deputy assistant secretary of state a us 
embassy official denied melton brought a list of people to be 
fired but said he told avril the us is interested in his 
efforts against drug traffickers 
diplomats said the four coup leaders who were not the officers 
fired acted from personal ambition and because they felt the 
dismissals presaged another purge 
avril is walking a very thin line one said the drug 
runners have big money and everything to lose in a democratic 
system one wonders if they will not always block the democratic 
process 
larry birns director of the council on hemispheric affairs in 
washington said avril should dismiss hundreds of junior fficers 
and soldiers involved in drug transshipment in rural areas 
he has hardly cleaned out the stable birns said he has 
just gotten rid of a few shovelloads of manure

americas long debate on legal abortion has 
changed few minds for all the emotional rhetoric public opinion 
on the issue has remained largely stable and deeply divided for 
more than a decade 
usually opinions ebb and flow with the tide of events on this 
issue not at all said james shriver of the gallup organization 
it just seems to be a bedrock opinion that has been unshaken by 
all the turmoil 
not all polls are in accord while most show no trends some 
have tracked a slight decline in support for abortion in the 1980s 
when president reagan took a strong antiabortion posture still 
others see proabortion shifts 
the difference owing to the issues sensitivity and the 
ambivalence many americans feel toward abortion is the wording of 
questions used to track opinion polls find americans personally 
disapprove of abortion most call it murder but at the same 
time most are loathe to restrict it 
consequently some movement against abortion appears in national 
opinion research center polls that pose specific circumstances 
under which abortions may be sought polls on broader policy views 
however show no movement 
gallup for example has asked since 1975 simply whether 
abortion should be legal under any circumstances under certain 
circumstances or illegal the most liberal group has fluctuated 
from 21 percent to 25 percent the middle 52 percent to 57 
percent and abortion opponents 17 percent to 22 percent 
as a trend shriver said recently thats absolutely flat 
but norc at the university of chicago has found changes in 
acceptance of abortion under specific conditions support for 
abortion for a married woman who did not want more children slipped 
from 47 percent in 1980 to 40 percent in 1988 those saying poverty 
was grounds for abortion fell from 52 percent to 42 percent and 
those accepting abortion for an unwed woman who did not want to 
marry the father fell from 48 percent to 39 percent 
norc pollster tom smith who classified these movements as 
quite small but regular attributed them to the reagan 
administrations antiabortion posture and aggressive campaigning 
by antiabortion groups it follows that such efforts making their 
appeal at a personal level would have an effect on the more 
personal poll questions 
kathleen a frankovic a cbs news pollster agreed that 
antiabortion activity may have made it more comfortable socially 
to express antiabortion opinions still she noted broader 
measures focused more on policy matters than on personal views 
have not moved consistently 
a cbs newsnew york times question for instance has found a 
slight increase in support for current abortion law from 38 
percent in 1985 to 46 percent this year and the share approving of 
legal abortion if a woman and her doctor agree on it has held 
steady 62 percent in 1980 61 percent now 
the group saying no to abortions if the woman and her doctor 
agree was 19 percent in 1980 25 percent in early 1981 22 percent 
later in 1981 and 25 percent this year with a 3point error margin 
and no annual figures through most of the 1980s it is difficult to 
discern a trend 
in nbc newswall street journal polling those saying decisions 
on abortion should be left to a woman and her doctor made up 78 
percent in 1980 and 72 percent this year that also was within the 
margin of error and there was even less movement in the group in 
another question that said abortion should not be illegal 
sixtyone percent in 1982 62 percent in 1989 
similarly a harris poll question since 1973 has asked if 
respondents favor or oppose that years us supreme court ruling 
legalizing abortion support was at 52 percent in 1973 and 56 
percent this year 
what we find is that people feel that a woman should have the 
right to have an abortion but they personally feel uncomfortable 
about abortions said mary klette an nbc pollster its just a 
very personal opinion and no matter what happens it doesnt 
change

attempted murder in fridays rampage which left seven dead 
authorities said he may have fled to mexico and acknowledged they 
will have a tough time finding him 
the note written in spanish was found inside the 
bloodsplattered 1979 ford that salcido is believed to have been 
driving before it was discovered abandoned in san rafael friday 
afternoon 
police believe salcido cut his daughters throats later that 
evening killing two of them at a garbage dump 15 miles north of 
san rafael 
forgive me god but this law made me do it said the note 
which was written in spanish we could live better me and my 
children but what can i do 
officials could not say what this law meant but salcido was 
reportedly upset by a childsupport court order last week 
the note was filed in federal court monday in support of the 
fbis request for an arrest warrant charging salcido with unlawful 
flight to avoid prosecution which was granted by us magistrate 
frederick woelflen 
an fbi affidavit said investigators believed salcido had escaped 
to mexico 
we will finally locate him and get him but its hard work to 
do that said fbi spokesman chuck latting 
authorities assume salcido went south because hes a mexican 
national we know that last christmas he visited mexico in 
absolute total honesty we have no indication which direction he 
went latting said 
i would be very surprised if he hung around he could still be 
in sonoma county as far as we know 
salcido who comes from the mexican state of sinaloa was 
described by some acquaintances as friendly and wellmannered and 
by others as a paranoid cocaine user prone to violent outbursts 
the slayings began with the deaths of his wife his 
motherinlaw two of his wifes sisters and one of his 
coworkers two of his daughters teresa 1 and sofia 4 were 
found dead at a garbage dump saturday 
a third daughter 3yearold carmina was reported in stable 
condition monday at petaluma valley hospital with a slashed throat 
her grandfather bob richards visited her monday and both were 
protected by armed deputies 
salcido was charged with four counts of murder monday in the 
slayings of mrs salcido teresa sofia and the coworker murder 
charges have not been filed yet in the other three killings 
salcido was also charged with three counts of attempted murder 
in the attacks on carmina another coworker and the coworkers 
wife 
although photos and descriptions of the 5foot9 180pound 
salcido have been circulated to california airports and border 
guards sonoma county sheriff richard michaelsen theorized that the 
former grand cru winery worker hasnt strayed far from the murder 
scenes in the lush wineproducing county north of san francisco 
my best guess is that hes laying low were assuming hes in 
our county or in marin county the sheriff said 
he may be holed up waiting for the media attention to ease up 
anybody who happens on his path is in extreme danger 
michaelsen said 
latting acknowledged that salcido is believed to have extensive 
contacts within the hispanic community 
it makes it tough said latting i mean its hard dirty 
work 
salcido came the united states as an illegal immigrant but 
apparently became a legal resident after his 1984 marriage to the 
former angela richards who was a us citizen immigration 
officials said 
grand cru winery owners offered a 5000 reward for information 
and another 10000 was allocated by gov george deukmejian on 
monday sonoma county supervisor janet nicholson said she will ask 
the board of supervisors on tuesday to chip in 20000 in hopes 
that he salcido will be apprehended before harming someone else 
meanwhile county residents have been unsettled by the killings 
people are real scared around here said dorothy mccann a 
store clerk who lives in glen ellen with her boyfriend we have a 
loaded gun in the cupboard people are just looking at each other 
the los angeles times reported that the salcido marriage became 
severely strained after salcido told his wife three days before 
her death that he had been ordered to pay substantial child 
support to an exwife in fresno county a woman angela salcido had 
known nothing about 
now i can get an annulment nextdoor neighbor steve nielsen 
quoted her as saying 
val hansen owner of the valley of the moon bar about a mile 
from salcidos dingy onebedroom home in boyes said he used to 
see salcido come in for a beer a couple of times a week 
he was always nice hello how are you that sort of 
thing hansen said he never caused any sort of trouble he 
was always upbeat 
hansen said mrs salcido seldom came to the bar with her 
husband but sat primly at his side when she did they never 
fought or even bickered maybe it was almost too perfect he 
recalled 
brian mann a clerk at the boyes hot springs food center said 
salcido told him he married angela four years ago because she got 
pregnant

blood donations rose 10 percent last 
year because many people wanted to take the accompanying compulsory 
aids test discreetly a drug industry newsletter 
researchers say many donors want to take the test for aids 
antibodies without making it obvious the swiss pharmaceutical 
industrys health file said monday the bulletin did not 
provide figures 
switzerland has the highest aids rate in europe world health 
organization figures put the 1988 rate at 54 cases per 100000 
people followed by france with 35 cases 
researchers found that many more people from highrisk groups 
such as homosexuals prostitutes and drug addicts come forward for 
aids antibodies testing when authorities guarantee anonymity the 
monthly swiss industry bulletin said 
testing positive for aids antibodies indicates the person tested 
was exposed to the virus though it does not mean the person has

amnesty international today questioned an official 
finding that cleared british soldiers in the shooting deaths of 
three unarmed ira members in gibraltar it said the inquest jury 
acted on incomplete evidence amnesty noted that spanish police 
who were involved in tracking the three to the gibraltar border 
did not testify it also cited conflicting testimony 
britain has faced persistent questions over the march 6 1988 
killing of irish republican army members mairead farrell daniel 
mccann and sean savage by a military unit believed to have been 
flown in from britain 
the shootings stirred an international controversy 
prime minister margaret thatchers office said it saw the 
amnesty report which was published today 
as far as we are concerned the whole matter has been fully 
considered by the inquest and we see no grounds for opening up a 
fresh inquiry said a spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the inquest jury ruled 92 in september that the killings were 
lawful 
amnesty a londonbased worldwide human rights organization and 
winner of the 1977 nobel peace prize demanded anew that a judical 
inquiry be made in the killings 
its report said the inquest in gibraltar failed to allay 
suspicions of an official policy of deliberate planned killings 
of suspected members of armed opposition groups 
amnesty sent three observers to the inquest led by stephen 
owen a lawyer and ombudsman of british columbia canada 
owen said in an interview monday that he was not accusing the 
british of stepping beyond the law im saying doubt remains that 
has to be resolved 
amnesty said the inquest in the british colony of gibraltar was 
conducted properly and that the verdict reached fairly but was 
based on evidence which from the outset was incomplete 
britain said it acted on information the three were armed and 
planned to set off a car bomb in the middle of touristpacked 
gibraltar on the southern spanish coast the ira which is 
fighting to rid northern ireland of british rule and unite it with 
the irish republic acknowledged the three were members sent to 
gibraltar on active service 
testimony showed however that the three were unarmed no bomb 
was found in their car and according to witnesses at least two of 
those killed appeared to be trying to surrender when shot 
the government said the officers feared the agents might have 
remotecontrol devices to explode the car bomb 
amnesty complained details about government policy the 
planning of the operation and the quality of the intelligence were 
not revealed 
it said spanish police testimony could have helped establish 
whether the three were known to be without guns or explosives 
much forensic evidence was destroyed because standard 
procedures were not followed and the state pathologist was 
denied adequate postmortem facilities and ballistics reports it 
said 
the report added 
most of the key independent civilian eye witnesses were 
discovered by media journalists and not by the police the 
organization is also concerned that discrepancies between 
witnesses testimonies had not been resolved and that many 
questions remained unanswered such as from what exact position 
the soldiers had fired and whether the suspects had made attempts 
to surrender 
it noted that police in northern ireland were accused before of 
killing when they could have made arrests and said the inquest 
has again failed to alleviate public concern that these suspects 
were killed rather than arrested 
two weeks ago british trial lawyer hilary kitchin who also 
observed the inquest wrote that it fell short of international 
legal standards and raised questions about the legality of the 
killings

a premature claim by georgia tech scientists that 
they created lowtemperature fusion shows that researchers must be 
careful about announcing their findings 
there is a lot of pressure to advertise oneself in this 
increasingly competitive world where research money is hard to come 
by said dr arnold relman editor of the new england journal of 
medicine 
the public doesnt know what to think theres a lot of 
cynicism about science a lot of time being wasted 
the tech scientists claim the second such that was withdrawn 
within the past year has not prompted the school to put a tighter 
rein on what its researchers announce said thomas stelson techs 
executive vice president 
we are fundamentally an open institution he said 
academic freedom is a sort of a sacred issue a faculty member 
can do whatever he wants we do not centrally review the hundreds 
of papers that go out of here each year nor do we intend to 
the cold fusion claim was retracted two days after the 
announcement when the researchers found there may have been 
problems with instruments 
my wildest guess is that it wont make any difference said 
joseph ford a physics professor known as a dissident voice on the 
faculty the individuals who submitted the experiment have 
something of a track record i dont think most people will pay 
much attention to the fact that they jumped the gun 
he said the school may have a temporary public relations 
problem especially because the announcement follows the premature 
claim that tech researchers had produced a metal alloy that could 
function at recordhigh temperatures those results in 
superconductivity could not be verified by other researchers and 
the project was dropped 
but alumni are not going to quit giving and agencies are not 
going to quit funding ford said 
he said the fact that the admission made the front page might 
discourage others from jumping the gun 
but if people wish to be reckless or careless nothing 
prevents that ford said 
officials at the national academy of science in washington 
dc declined to speculate on what effects on the school might be 
stelson said georgia tech has a strong program in areas related 
to the experiment and that the announcement should have no effect 
on it 
we have a good technical background and we would like to 
contribute to this area he said 
the process of peer review is intended to find faulty methods or 
reasoning that might render an experiment or discovery invalid 
before the results are presented 
while not foolproof it substantially reduces the likelihood of 
having to retract announced results 
the discovery of cold fusion was announced march 23 by 
scientists at the university of utah the process is seen as a 
potential for cheap clean and virtually inexhaustible supply of 
energy 
the utah announcement sent scientists scurrying to build their 
own versions of the process 
five georgia tech scientists led by james mahaffey using what 
they knew from press accounts and computer bulletin boards came up 
with what they thought was a duplicate process 
after a press conference announcing their work it was 
determined that problems with some equipment put the results in 
doubt 
we thought we had it all calibrated right but we found out 
that one instrument was more temperaturesensitive than we 
thought stelson said we have new detectors were in the 
process of checking them out in some detail

secret service agents arrested a 37yearold man 
who called the white house to claim he could breach security 
surrounding president bushs visit monday and then left his 
telephone number 
richard gregory of clinton township was taken into custody at 
selfridge field air national guard base as the president arrived 
there to fly out of michigan said jim hughes head of the detroit 
secret service office 
gregory had called the white house earlier monday 
he stated that he had a theory about how to penetrate the 
security around the president but in that theory it involved a 
man wearing a business suit and carrying a cellular telephone that 
would actually be an explosive device hughes said 
gregory left his car telephone number and police used it to 
trace information about him hughes said officers were on the 
lookout when gregory arrived at selfridge fields main gate 
when he was apprehended at the main gate of selfridge he was 
carrying a cellular telephone he had a briefcase also hughes 
said 
an ordnance squad from the base found no explosives after 
examining the telephone and blowing apart the briefcase with a 
water cannon 
as gregory arrived at the base about 25 miles northeast of 
detroit the president was arriving at a different gate and was in 
no danger the agent said 
bush traveled to nearby hamtramck to announce economic 
incentives for poland speaking before about 4000 people in this 
largely polish community 
agents have no idea why gregory called the white house but 
treated him as though he were a threat to the president 
when he called the tune we played it hughes said 
gregory faces federal charges of interfering with a secret 
service agents duty he later was questioned and detained by 
secret service officials in detroit and had not been formally 
charged monday night

an israeli army investigation 
into the slayings of four arabs during a raid by border police 
indicates an excessive use of firearms faulty planning and bad 
execution 
the army on monday released its preliminary findings of the 
bloodshed thursday in the village of nahalin four miles southwest 
of bethlehem 
villagers said two police snipers firing from a secondstory 
window killed three young palestians and wounded several others 
the international red cross denounced the raid 
although the initial army report was critical of the border 
police it denied allegations that the police had acted with 
premeditation 
an army spokesman said last week that the paramilitary border 
police entered the village before dawn to apprehend residents 
suspected of having thrown stones at israeli cars he claimed the 
police opened fire when rocks were thrown at them 
villagers gave a different version 
they said the raid began 5 am as 22 jeeploads of border police 
conducted housetohouse searches and fired indiscriminately as 
many residents emerged from dawn prayers during ramadan the moslem 
holy month 
they shot at anything that moved dogs donkeys people 
cars said naim shakarneh whose brother subheh was among those 
killed 
the villagers said the worst violence occurred outside the 
azawieh mosque when worshipers heard the gunfire ran into the 
streets and began hurling rocks at the police 
they blamed three deaths on two policemen who they said fired 
from a building across the street from the mosque 
fatmeh ibrahim abu mor 28 who owns the building taken over by 
the two officers said they ordered her to let them in went to a 
window on the second floor and started shooting she said after 
the police left she found more than a dozen cartridges on the floor 
residents said the three palestinians were killed within 20 
yards of each other one on the roof of a low building another 
near the mosque and the third in the street beside a rock slab 
the fourth palestinian was killed in a cemetery across the 
street from the mosque according to the villages 
doctors at jerusalems makassad hospital said a fifth victim was 
brain dead 
it was one of the deadliest single incidents since arabs in the 
west bank and gaza strip began an uprising against israeli 
occupation in december 1987 
rajah shehadeh of law in the service of man a west bank 
affiliate of the genevabased international commission of jurists 
called the nahalin raid an act of willfull killing and bodily 
harm 
he said monday the group appealed to signatories of the fourth 
geneva convention which deals with the protection of people in 
occupied areas to meet their clear obligation

thats fine but theyre forcing me to live in their past

movies the big chill

television the wonder years 
books volumes on the riotous 1968 democratic national 
convention in chicago as insignificant an event as ever happened 
in this country 
dillenburg and elliott got together in 1987 and discovered their 
mutual exasperation with oldies radio they decided it was time 
to get the monkees off their backs 
preserve what is worth remembering from the 60s the beatles 
bob dylan and the civil rights movement for example and scrap 
the rest dillenburg suggests 
naftat is part of a natural antiboomer backlash according to

people who print the logo on sweatshirts keychains pens or 
other consumer goods will be forced to give new york state between 
6 and 10 percent of the money they make said stephen morello a 
state deputy commissioner for economic development 
the state has spent more than 100 million advertising itself to 
tourists since beginning the i love new york advertising 
campaign in 1977 he said 
we think this is one modest way to begin recapturing some of 
the investment without negatively impacting the mottos 
effectiveness morello said 
the state registered the motto with a red heart symbol in place 
of the word love though the symbol has been adapted for a 
variety of bumper stickers and other uses the state only holds the 
trademark for loving new york

the us organization that sent 
american observers to the philippines for that countrys disputed 
1986 elections has opened an office in panama to monitor the may 7 
general elections 
the government however issued a statement monday warning that 
it had not authorized any foreign organization to open electoral 
information offices but stopped short of saying it intended to 
close the center for democracy office 
allen weinstein president of the washingtonbased center told 
a news conference that his organizations goal is to help bring 
about national reconciliation and democracy in panama 
a letter signed by sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of 
the senate subcommittee on hemispheric affairs said the opening of 
the office demonstrates the us governments worry about whether 
panamas government will live up to its promises to hold free 
elections 
weinstein said the office will give out informal and 
unofficial information about all phases of the electoral 
process 
the center for democracy includes republican and democratic 
party leaders and senators 
panama said it had invited election observers from antigua 
costa rica el salvador honduras jamaica and nicaragua

failure to improve the us educational system 
could saddle americas economy with enormous longterm costs 
the congressional joint economic committee said today in its first 
bipartisan report since 1980 
america is falling behind the rest of the world in promoting 
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money 
per student than any other country in the world the committee said 
while the panel did not break any new ground in recommending 
solutions to education problems or others facing the economy it 
was able for the first time in nine years to issue a bipartisan 
report supported by both democrats and republicans on the 
20member committee 
during the reagan years the panel of senators and house members 
became a battleground of warring economic ideologies with democrats 
and republicans unable to reach any common ground 
members of the panel gave credit for the show of unity to rep 
lee hamilton the new chairman of the committee hamilton had 
pushed hard for a joint report as the proper congressional response 
to president bushs calls for a bipartisan effort to address the 
huge federal budget deficit and the countrys other economic 
problems 
hamilton dind said members of the committee agreed that the 
most crucial thing congress and the administration need to do is 
address the federal budget deficit 
realistic and prudent budgeting should be our top economic 
priority hamilton said 
the report however did not provide any specifics on how the 
gap between revenues and spending should be narrowed 
on education the report cited statistics showing that the 
country has an overall dropout rate of 25 percent with rates for 
blacks hitting 40 percent and for hispanics exceeding 50 percent 
partly as a result approximately 13 percent of 17yearold 
americans cannot read write or count the report said 
the committee said education is perhaps the most prominent 
area where our nations shortcomings threaten to impose enormous 
longterm costs 
if we are to keep up with the rest of the industrialized 
world we must do much better in promoting literacy job skills and 
reducing the rate of elementary and secondary school dropouts 
the panel concluded 
during the reagan administration the democratic portion of the 
report stressed the countrys plunging international fortunes 
citing huge trade deficits and the emergence of the country as the 
worlds largest debtor nation as evidence that reagans economic 
policies were not working 
the republicans on the panel would counter that democrats were 
being unduly pessimistic in failing to give reagans policies 
credit for the longest peacetime expansion in history a recovery 
from the 198182 recession which is now in its seventh year 
sen william roth the ranking republican on the committee 
praised hamilton for taking a more conciliatory approach this year 
by recognizing the economys strengths we are able to discuss 
concerns as well roth rdel said in a statement which 
accompanied the report 
some democratic members of the panel said they were concerned 
that in trying to reach agreement the committee had glossed over 
serious problems 
four democratic members of the panel rep augustus f hawkins 
dcalif and sens paul sarbanes dmd lloyd bentsen dtexas 
and jeff bingaman dnm filed statements raising concerns about 
specific problems 
bentsen noted that the us merchandise trade deficit which 
improved dramatically in 1988 is expected to worsen again this 
year exacerbating our dependence on foreign capital and causing 
us foreign debt to balloon beyond 600 billion 
sarbanes the past chairman of the joint committee said he was 
concerned that the report conveys an inappropriate sense of 
complacency 
over the past decade we have created unprecedented imbalances 
in the budget in international trade in the accumulation of 
both domestic and international debt which suggest we are skating 
on very thin ice sarbanes said 
among the economic problems which should be addressed the 
report cited rising inflationary pressures the pace of 
productivity increases the financial problems facing the savings 
and loan industry the third world debt crisis and rising levels of 
debt among american corporations and consumers 
in addition to more resources for education the report cited 
research and development on new technologies environmental 
cleanup poverty and homelessness as areas where additional 
resources are needed

a smaller proportion of americans voted in 
last years presidential election than in 1984 but the rate went 
up for those who voted while abroad according to the head of the 
federal voting assistance program 
henry valentino said the overseas rate rose to 353 percent from 
33 percent four years earlier based on an estimate that 25 
million civilian americans were outside the country on election day 
but despite the improvement that rate was still lower than the 
overall turnout which was 50 percent 
its because so many americans abroad dont know theyre 
allowed to vote or find it too much trouble to get an absentee 
ballot valentino said in an interview its not like just 
going down to the corner polling place 
he added that the increase last year was due to efforts made by 
both political parties to get out the vote 
many states have slow and complex procedures for issuing 
absentee ballots especially to americans who live in other 
countries some voters mail in their ballots too late for them to 
reach election boards in time to be counted 
valentino calculated that 21 house seats and eight senate seats 
could have been decided by the absentee vote 
of the roughly 750000 members of the armed forces stationed 
abroad 632 percent voted compared with 553 percent in 1984 
valentino credited intensive and aggressive voting assistance 
by the military for the high rate among that group 
valentinos office is part of the department of defense but is 
responsible for helping both the military and civilians overseas to 
vote 
older soldiers like older civilians at home were more likely 
to vote in the armed forces only 462 percent of the 18 to 
20yearolds turned in ballots compared with 716 percent for 
those 45 and older 
each military unit has an officer responsible for helping get 
out the vote valentino said their efforts were visible in an even 
bigger increase of voting by dependents of americans in the armed 
forces spouses grown children and other relatives in their 
households that rate jumped to 57 percent from only 276 percent 
four years earlier 
voting by the 200000 civilian employees of the us government 
abroad and their dependents also increased rising to 645 percent 
from 575 percent in 1984 
but in general a smaller proportion of americans vote than do 
residents of other countries with unrestricted elections 
i used to say it was fewer than in any country except 
botswana said curtis gans head of the committee for the study 
of the american electorate 
now i understand that botswana is ahead of us

the cost of importing pepper and other spices 
favored by americans as food seasonings has tumbled sharply but 
its still nothing to sneeze at says the agriculture department 
last years import bill was 3494 million for 191545 metric 
tons of assorted spices ranging from allspice and anise to 
turmeric and vanilla beans that was down from a record 4386 
million and 208694 tons in 1987 
its not an indication that the trend in spice consumption is 
being reversed says rex dull of the departments foreign 
agricultural service rather it was a technical correction 
primarily involving pepper imports 
pepper is the biggest item on the us list of spice imports 
most is black pepper but there is a substantial amount of white in 
1988 unground black pepper imports were valued at 952 million 
for 26939 tons compared with 1478 million for 31372 tons in 
1987 
indonesia was the biggest supplier last year followed by india 
and brazil 
some relief for the pepper supply was provided in january by the 
food and drug administration when it eased an 18monthold policy 
of automatic detention of shipments from india until those had been 
checked for possible salmonella contamination the indian 
government can now certify that pepper meets fda standards 
dull who works in the agencys horticultural and tropical 
products division said in a recent telephone interview that for 
several years global pepper supplies were tight and prices high 
in 1987 for example the price of indonesian black pepper was a 
12month average of just over 237 per pound delivered to new york 
city indian black pepper was almost as high 
there was anticipation that the supply would improve and 
prices come down dull said prices did come down in part of 
1988 but there was fear that drought would reduce indias harvest 
and they came back up late in the year 
but the increase wasnt nearly as great as the runup of pepper 
prices in the mid1980s until september 1985 the new york spot 
price of indian black pepper was less than a dollar per pound 
last october the new york price dropped to an average for the 
month of 995 cents the first time in more than three years that 
it had been less than a dollar however prices quickly regained 
lost ground and in march averaged 159 per pound 
dull is the author of the usda agencys latest annual report on 
1988 spice trade the report issued this week noted that while 
pepper was the main reason for reduced imports there were other 
items also affected 
high prices and producergovernment controlled marketing 
practices have tempered the demand for cassia nutmeg and mace 
the report said smaller crops have resulted in higher prices for 
mustard seed saffron sesame seed paprika and pakistani chili 
peppers 
prices of anise cloves and java vanilla beans were down 
however the report said

soybean farmers like to think of foreign 
buyers in giant terms like japan or western europe but an 
agriculture department report suggests a shrimp can be a pretty 
good customer too 
daryl a brehm us agricultural attache in jakarta indonesia 
says there is a promising outlook for selling more us soybeans to 
that southeast asian country to feed an expanding shrimp industry 
exports of shrimp are rising and the potential for 
increased production barely has been scratched brehm says in the 
forthcoming may issue of agexporter magazine published by the 
departments foreign agricultural service 
more efficient production methods would call for increased 
soybean and soybean meal imports which make up a portion of 
commercial shrimp feeds he said us exports of these items 
to indonesia could benefit from this modernization 
the country now has about 250000 hectares of brackish shrimp 
ponds with a potential to expand to 3 million hectares and fresh 
water ponds now covering only 33000 hectares could expand to 1 
million brehm said a hectare is about 247 acres 
indonesian shrimp exports were worth more than 300 million last 
year with japan taking about 80 percent and even with declining 
international prices returns from wellmanaged production are 
lucrative with reports of 100 percent profits not uncommon he 
said 
the american soybean association has been providing technical 
help to indonesian shrimp farmers advocating a semiintensive 
system that requires a relatively small capital outlay brehm 
said a relatively lowcost pelleted feed could be used 
at present less than 10 percent of the indonesian shrimp 
farmers used a commercial feed the association concluded that a 
lowercost feed and education programs could revolutionize the 
production of shrimp in indonesia and boost the sales of us 
soybeans

decadeslong friendships with a convicted 
felon and a wealthy texas developer could prove to be the undoing 
for house speaker jim wright who faces charges he violated 69 of 
the chambers rules 
the names of william carlos moore and george mallick were 
frequently mentioned as the house ethics committees outside 
counsel richard j phelan detailed the charges against wright in 
his 279page report 
the committee said monday it found reason to believe the 
texas democrat skirted house rules limiting outside income 
requiring reporting of gifts and barring acceptance of gifts from 
peoplr with a direct interest in legislation 
specifically the committee alleged that wright had an overall 
scheme to evade house limits on outside earned income by selling 
bulk quantities of his book reflections of a public man to 
groups to which he had delivered speeches the honorarium payments 
which are limited under house rules were characterized as 
royalties 
the book was the brainchild of wright and moore who envisioned 
a collection of the speakers earlier speeches poems and writings 
which would be sold at low cost to a very broad audience 
including college students and average citizens said phelans 
report 
but the book rarely made it into the hands of average 
citizens 
the real focus of the marketing effort for reflections of a 
public man was on bulk sales to trade associations and other 
groups the report said almost 98 percent of all sales 
were bulk sales of 15 or more books 
wrights friendship with moore dates back to 1954 when moore 
worked for the texans first congressional campaign handing out 
campaign literature and canvassing voters doortodoor 
in 1963 moore became political and legislative director of the 
texas conference of teamsters and later served in washington as 
the unions director of political and legislative action in that 
role moore reported directly to teamsters president james h 
hoffa the former union president disappeared july 30 1975 and 
his body has never been found 
in 1975 moore pleaded guilty to one count of income tax evasion 
and the government in return agreed not to prosecute him for income 
tax evasion in 1968 and 1969 or for misappropriation of teamsters 
funds for personal use 
two days before his sentencing wright wrote to the judge asking 
for leniency for moore 
it is without reservation that i now ask the court on mr 
moores behalf to take into consideration the obvious value to us 
all of mr moores continued presence in our communities wright 
wrote 
moore served 4 months of a twoyear sentence in federal prison 
mallick a fort worth real estate developer first met wright in 
1962 or 1963 when the congressman cut the ribbon opening a shopping 
center in the states tarrant county the report said 
over the next 20 years the relationship between the two men was 
mainly social although mallick worked on wrights campaigns and he 
and his sons have been longtime members of the wright congressional 
club 
as a developer mallick put forth the mallick concept of 
inexpensive apartments for single or newlymarried people that in 
square footage were about the size of a house trailer 
in 1979 mallick formed the mallight investment corporation 
which was owned by mallick his wife marlene and betty and jim 
wright the company which later changed its name to mallightco 
was created for the purposes of acquiring and developing real 
estate buying and selling securities and making other 
investments the report said 
betty wright was placed on the mallightco payroll in 1981 as a 
consultant hired to seek out and research new investment 
opportunities according to phelans report mallick and mrs 
wright looked into investments involving converting sugar cane to 
alcohol making bulgar wheat cakes and joining a limited 
partnership backing the movie annie 
the committee found however that mrs wright did little work 
to warrant her 18000ayear salary which proved to be a 
financial burden for the company mallightco often had to borrow 
money or delay payment to provide mrs wright with her salary 
mallick has produced no work product created by mrs wright as 
an employee of mallightco no reports no correspondence no notes 
of telephone conversations no investment analyses the report 
said 
in addition mrs wrights background as a member of the staff 
of the house public works committee and executive secretary of a 
leading fort worth hotel did not make her qualified to evaluate 
possible investments the report said 
mrs wrights salary from mallightco was not a bona fide 
salary but rather a gift indirectly from mallick to jim wright 
through two intermediaries mallightco and mrs wright it said 
in total mallick improperly provided wright with 145000 in 
gifts over a 10year period according to the charges and the 
committee found that the fort worth developer had a direct interest 
in legislation before congress

the ethics report on house speaker jim wright 
lets him off the hook on some of the most serious allegations that 
were made against him giving him a better chance of winning the 
public debate on his case 
on the long list of charges investigated by the ethics 
committee potentially the most serious involved misuse of public 
office and of public money those have been dismissed 
whats left are nearly six dozen charges involving wrights 
rather unusual personal finances 
the speaker had a sweet book publishing deal where he received 
55 percent of the royalties and sold his book in bulk to interest 
groups the committee says that may have been a deliberate scheme 
to evade limits on outside income from which royalties are exempt 
and a business partner supplied the speaker with a home in fort 
worth a car and an 18000year job for his wife the committee 
classified those as gifts that the speaker failed to report 
the most serious remaining charge is the committees belief that 
the business partner george mallick had an interest in 
legislation if it finds that to be the case those gifts not only 
were not reported they were against the rules 
but that most serious charge may also be the weakest in that 
the committee found mallick had an interest in legislation only in 
a very broad sense it did not find that wright did legislative 
favors that specifically helped mallick or that mallick sought 
such favors 
wrights allies were cheered by the report 
theres nothing new here said rep martin frost dtexas 
part of wrights informal defense team i think the speaker 
clearly will be found innocent 
given the higher standard of proof needed for the panel to 
determine that wright did indeed violate house rules rep beryl 
anthony dark speculated that the charges might die in committee 
also working in wrights favor is the decision by house 
republicans to lay low for the time being for fear of appearing as 
shrill accusers who cant wait for the next step the speakers 
rebuttal to the committee 
the republican rhetorical calm gives wright the opportunity to 
seize the spotlight to his advantage those efforts have already 
begun 
on the question of the book deal wright is pointing to the 
specific exemption that book royalties enjoy under house rules 
and on the question of gifts the speaker is playing his trump 
card transforming the issue by characterizing the committee 
report as an attack on his wife and vowing to defend her honor 
the speaker is making these points in carefullycontrolled 
televised settings and he has canceled his regular presession 
news conferences so he doesnt get his point dulled by fussy 
questions from reporters 
wrights biggest public relations test could come when the 
ethics committee hears his rebuttal to its charges those hearings 
could well be public and the speaker will surely have to provide 
good answers to some very tough questions 
a strong performance one that gains him support from the 
general public could help carry wrights career forward even if 
the committee finds him guilty of some relatively minor violations 
a bad showing could help bring him down even if hes exonerated 
by the committee 
republicans are ready to apply the same fitness to serve 
test that democrats applied to john tower an argument that the 
accumulated evidence is enough even if no single item can bring him 
down and they intend to make the full house vote on wrights 
ethics regardless of the committee conclusion 
one thing is clear wrights survival will require a marathon 
effort on his part 
awaiting committee action behind the current set of charges are 
others some potentially more serious 
the panel is still investigating a joint investment by mallick 
and wright in an oil and gas well that seemed unusually profitable 
despite the limited apparent value of the well itself 
and in a separate ethics case which has so far been on the back 
burner wright has been accused of improper public disclosure of 
cia covert action in nicaragua 
wright told reporters last summer that he had clear 
testimony from cia people that the agency sought to stir up civil 
unrest in nicaragua with hopes of provoking a harsh crackdown by 
the leftist sandinista government republican members of the 
intelligence committee and others cried foul 
so far democrats are sticking with wright and theres no clear 
evidence that hes costing the party votes the democrats recently 
won two special elections to fill vacant house seats including one 
in vice president dan quayles old indiana district 
but as the next election grows closer and the wright case gets 
more national exposure democrats will be watching the polls 
it may not be enough for the ethics committee to let wright off 
the hook if he wins that battle the speakers challenge for the 
coming months must be finding ways to win favor with the public

in a june 1984 white house discussion on 
whether to solicit thirdcountry support for the nicaraguan 
contras george bush foresaw potential trouble for the reagan 
administration 
the only problem that might come up the thenvice president 
said is if the united states were to promise to give these third 
parties something in return so that some people could interpret 
this as some kind of an exchange 
but as disclosures at oliver norths trial have shown bush 
wittingly or unwittingly quickly became involved in quid pro quo 
arrangements with third countries as part of an administration 
effort to help the nicaraguan rebels 
bush has refused to comment on his role in the contra support 
network saying he doesnt want to prejudice norths trial but the 
questions raised by disclosures in norths trial are unlikely to go 
away without an eventual response by the president 
in depicting north as a mere cog in a huge machine aimed at 
keeping the contras alive norths lawyers have disclosed that 
nine months after bush pinpointed the problem that could result 
from enticing countries to support the contras he met with 
honduran president robert suazo cordova bush announced expedited 
delivery of us military and economic aid to the central american 
country 
the month before bushs visit president reagan had approved a 
secret quid pro quo plan slipping more than 110 million in extra 
assistance to honduras in exchange for its continued support of the 
contras 
bush was copied in to receive a feb 19 1985 memo 
recommending the approach to honduras that provides incentives 
for them to persist in aiding the freedom fighters 
a feb 20 1985 memo contained the notation we want vp to 
also discuss this matter next to a discussion of the quid pro quo 
arrangement 
bush was copied in on another memo dated may 1 1985 in which 
reagan approved a 45 million increase in cia support for honduras 
after bush at the june 25 1984 meeting spelled out the 
potential trouble reagan minutes later closed the discussion with 
an admonition for secrecy 
if such a story gets out well all be hanging by our thumbs 
in front of the white house until we find out who did it reagan 
said according to a record of the meeting released at norths 
trial 
reagans periodic cautions to aides that thirdcountry contra 
assistance shouldnt be revealed were largely adhered to until 
norths trial on charges of trying to cover up various aspects of 
the irancontra affair 
the congressional irancontra committees uncovered thirdcountry 
support for the contras but failed to show that the reagan 
administration enticed the countries into providing it 
the rewards for honduras were part of the approach the reagan 
administration made to at least 11 countries seeking help for the 
contras the north trial has shown 
the honduran deal and some other quid pro quo arrangements 
spelled out in the courtroom took place before the pell amendment 
took effect in october 1985 it barred us officials from 
agreeing expressly or impliedly that foreign aid or military 
assistance to any third country would be conditioned on assistance 
to the contras 
versions of the boland amendment in effect from october 1984 to 
october 1986 banned military aid by us intelligence agencies to 
the contras 
reagans interpretation of the boland amendment according to 
testimony at norths trial by national security robert mcfarlane 
is that it simply didnt apply to the national security council 
where north worked 
but north and others saw the honduran deal as a possible 
violation of the boland amendment as reflected in a feb 20 1985 
memo by north and nsc aide raymond burghardt 
notwithstanding our own interpretations of the boland 
amendment it is very clear from the colloquy during the 
congressional debate that the legislative intent was to deny 
any direct or indirect support for the militaryparamilitary 
operations in nicaragua said the memo 
north and burghardt objected that the state department was going 
to have the us ambassador to honduras john negroponte deliver 
word of the arrangement to the honduran president north and others 
had proposed a secret emissary who would be unlikely to be called 
before congress 
negroponte who will be called upon to testify during his 
confirmation hearings for assistant secretary will undoubtedly be 
queried on whether or not such overtures were made to the 
hondurans after the boland amendment went in effect said the 
memo 
in short the decision to proceed without an emissary places 
both amb negroponte and our hopes with the hill at increased 
jeopardy we still believe that our original concept of an emissary 
is the proper way in which to proceed

the nuclear regulatory commission will be 
watching closely when pennsylvanias peach bottom nuclear plant 
starts up for the first time since onthejob sleeping by operators 
prompted the shutdown of the two plant reactors 
the nrc voted 30 monday to lift an order that had kept the 
plant closed since march 31 1987 when the commission said 
sleeping and inattention by 33 control room workers posed a safety 
threat to the public 
the operators must never again betray the special trust and 
countenance of the public nrc chairman lando zech told utility 
representatives we will be watching you very closely 
plant officials must complete a checklist of technical items 
before beginning the ascension to full power which will take 14 
weeks and be closely scrutinized by nrc inspectors 
the process is expected to begin as early as thursday with the 
withdrawal of control rods allowing a nuclear reaction to occur 
management changes by philadelphia electric have successfully 
addressed the root causes of the earlier problems the nrc 
staff said in recommending that the commissioners permit the plant 
to restart 
many of the problems at peach bottom occurred on the overnight 
or graveyard shift on at least two occasions according to nrc 
testimony in 1987 three of the four control room employees 
responsible for running the plant were asleep at the same time 
to end catnaps by operators plant officials replaced 
comfortable highbacked chairs in the control room with lowbacked 
models the nrc noted monday that the control room was brighter 
than in 1987 that low levels of radioactivity had been reduced 
within the plant and that operators had a better appearance 
of 39 operators now at the plant 24 were there at the time of 
the shutdown and all have been retrained 
a year after the shutdown james l everett stepped down as the 
chairman and chief executive officer of philadelphia electric co 
the plant operator following criticism of the handling of peach 
bottom 
philadelphia electric spokesman bill jones said there was no 
celebration at the plant marking the end of the shutdown which 
cost the company about 250 million in plant modifications 
purchases of replacement power and its share of a 125 million 
fine 
the fine largest in nrc history was split among philadelphia 
electric and the plants other three owners the others are public 
service gas and electric of newark nj atlantic electric co of 
atlantic city nj and delmarva power and light co of 
wilmington del 
philadelphia electric learned a valuable management lesson about 
monitoring nuclear reactors but it certainly has been an 
expensive lesson joseph paquette jr the companys chairman and 
chief executive officer said after the vote 
peach bottom operates two units on the susquehanna river near 
the maryland border the nrcs action on monday means one reactor 
will be able to restart with the other remaining dormant until the 
company seeks to restart it in september 
nrc commissioner james curtis missed mondays meeting because he 
was out of the country commissioner kenneth rogers did not vote 
because he once served on the board of one of the plants owners 
the nrc said

gasoline prices around the country rose 
suddenly after the exxon valdez spilled 10 million gallons of oil 
in alaska but exxon and a government energy official told a senate 
hearing the accident wasnt the reason 
that wasnt enough to convince sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
who criticized other oil companies for passing up an invitation to 
appear monday before his energy subcommittee on energy regulation 
and conservation 
you have an amazing burden of proof to convince the american 
people that the oil companies didnt exploit the valdez accident 
metzenbaum said i also invited arco mobil chevron bp texaco 
shell and amoco and i regret their failure to appear 
in the three weeks following the spill gasoline prices jumped 
10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country 
tracy stanton a shell service station owner in columbus ohio 
said in his 20 years of business he has never seen such a rapid 
increase in gasoline prices in such a short period of time 
including during the arab oil embargo of the 1970s 
jt mcmillan senior vice president of exxon told the senate 
subcommittee the idea that exxon raised prices to profit from 
that spill is completely unfounded the marketplace will not permit 
any unusual costs incurred by a particular supplier like the costs 
necessary to clean up the oil spill in alaska to be recovered in 
the marketplace 
although the alaskan oil spill temporarily affected the price of 
crude oil to the west coast the price of gasoline has been 
increasing for several months overall because the cost of crude oil 
has been rising he said 
w henson moore deputy secretary of the department of energy 
agreed with mcmillan that prices had been rising before the 
accident 
moore said that the spill and the oil lost because of the 
fiveday shutdown of shipping from prince william sound amounted to 
about 13 million barrels but he said the loss had no lasting or 
permanent effect on gasoline prices 
the oncoming summer driving season increased regulations 
higher cost imports and added excise taxes were other contributors 
to higher prices mcmillan said 
metzenbaum and others on the panel pressed the energy deputy 
secretary for a deeper explanation of increasing prices but he 
said complete data were unavailable and the department was still 
analyzing the situation 
stanton the service station operator from ohio blamed oil 
company greed and the control the major oil companies have gained 
at the refinery level and by increasing their number of 
companyoperated service stations stanton is the former president 
of the service station dealers of america 
the senator criticized exxons plan to deduct the costs of 
cleaning up the spill from the taxes they pay the federal 
government 
for every dollar they exxon spend the taxpayer will pick up 
34 cents said metzenbaum why shouldnt exxon foot the bill 
sen harry reid dnev has introduced a bill that would 
prevent the deductions which exxon said were a legitimate business 
loss allowed in the tax code as a deduction

imagine a road from los angeles to 
phoenix ariz 30 feet wide and coated with 4200 gallons of oily 
black slime per mile now slop the goop onto remote beaches and 
coves along prince william sound 
the exxon valdez tanker wreck has left about that much oil on 
the sounds once pristine shoreline exxon figures it at 366 
miles and the giant corporation has won federal approval for its 
plan to clean it up 
but the ambitious strategy revealed monday faces sharp 
skepticism and new demands that it be broadened to include other 
polluted areas some officials just smiled sadly when asked its 
chance of success 
the plan calls for a mobilization by early june of 4000 people 
and scores of vessels by sept 15 theyre supposed to erase the 
tarry remains of the nations worst oil spill from the rocky 
beaches of one of the worlds richest regions for fish and wildlife 
adm paul yost the head of the coast guard approved the 
proposal monday but he wondered if exxon could meet its goals in 
the face of the sounds notorious weather and the limited time 
available 
im concerned whether the level of activity can be kept up 
through the summer to complete cleanup said yost who demanded 
the plan last week 
dennis kelso commissioner of the alaska department of 
environmental conservation described it as barely adequate 
it needs more work he said adding it would be next week 
before he would comment on whether he believed it would work 
yost overseeing the cleanup at president bushs direction 
listened to the concerns of kelso and other state officials he 
then gave exxon until may 1 to come up with plans to deal with oil 
contamination outside the sound and disposal of oily waste 
the plan will be expanded to add in these other concerns 
said exxon spokesman don cornett 
he said that on saturday exxon would field its first landing 
craft equipped to work on the spill 
but exxon consultant ed owens said that initially more time 
would be spent on training than cleaning 
i dont think you should expect a big parade and fireworks on 
that day he said if you get out there youll see something 
happening 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez sumped more than 10 million 
gallons of crude oil into the sound after it ran aground on bligh 
reef on march 24 the company has been criticized for its initial 
response 
oil now stretches along alaskas southcentral coast for 
hundreds of miles scores of beaches and miles of shore in the 
sound are sticky black wastelands and parts of the kenai fjords 
national park and other areas in the gulf of alaska have been 
contaminated 
exxon estimates 4200 gallons of oil per mile are on the sound 
shoreline 1260 gallons per mile in the lightly oiled spots to as 
much as 12600 gallons per mile the shore averages 30 feet wide 
state officials have identified more than 50 beaches in the 
sound that need to be cleaned 
but there are probably hundreds more said kelsos deputy 
larry dietrich by the time you add in the gulf beaches whew 
with the time remaining before winter exxon will have to clean 
two or more miles per day to finish by its target 
but steve havig a state ecologist said one mile a day would be 
optimistic 
exxon plans to use cold salt water suction pumps and hotwater 
guns on the shoreline 
owens the exxon consultant said that on monday two crews 
worked on a quartermile beach on naked island two others were to 
be dispatched later in the week but training the crews is 
timeconsuming 
in the first month youre slogging and dogging it through 
the learning curve right now is down there owens said pointing 
at the floor 
the plan is a plan well change it as much as it needs to 
be 
state and federal agencies that are part of a shoreline advisory 
committee have concluded exxons plan was inadequate 
for instance the plan identifies areas to be cleaned and adds 
in mileage for contingencies 
the contingency figure of 608 miles is grossly inaccurate 
the western shoreline of pws which is still subject to oiling 
is 1481 miles other figures are also unsubstantiated the 
committee wrote referring to the sound 
and among other things it questioned whether exxon could 
mobilize as quickly as described in the plan which calls for the 
operation to hit high gear by june 11 
but owens said exxon has an ally in the seas relentless 
scouring 
the shoreline cleans itself naturally by wave action he 
said i would say that by next spring there will be a pocket or 
two we may have missed and by pockets i mean a few tens of yards

the sweeping economic and political changes 
adopted by polish authorities are having the side effect of 
encouraging the bush administration to talk more assertively about 
a possible end to the postwar division of europe 
while announcing some new economic initiatives aimed at 
promoting lasting reform in poland president bush also alluded 
monday to the divisions that have plagued europe since 1945 
the united states has never accepted the legitimacy of 
europes division bush said we accept no spheres of influence 
that deny the sovereign rights of nations 
bushs words made clear his view that his willingness to 
increase economic cooperation with poland and other likeminded 
east bloc countries is only part of a broader agenda his ultimate 
goal is an end to both the political divisions in europe and the 
dubious distinction of that continents central region of being the 
worlds most heavily militarized area 
it was 50 summers ago that germany invaded poland setting in 
motion a series of events that produced death devastation and 
ultimately the division of the continent where bitter cold war 
confrontations were routine for a generation after the wars end 
berlin for a time was synonymous with eastwest brinkmanship 
now the talk is of arms reductions cooperation and a shift 
toward deemphasis of ideology processes that have acquired 
considerable momentum since the advent of the gorbachev era in the 
soviet union 
almost a month to the day after moscow proposed huge cutbacks in 
armies and tactical warplanes in central europe the communist 
authorities in warsaw reached agreement with opposition leaders on 
legalizing the solidarity trade union and on holding democratic 
elections 
and bush traveled to the polishamerican city of hamtramck 
mich on monday to extoll the new paths being taken by the warsaw 
leadership 
if polands experiment succeeds other countries may follow 
bush said while we must still differentiate among the nations of 
eastern europe poland offers two lessons for all 
first there can be no progress without significant political 
and economic liberalization he said second help from the 
west will come in concert with liberalization our friends and 
european allies share this philosophy 
later a senior state department official said the changing face 
of poland augurs well for the future stability of europe as 
mistrust based on differing ideologies diminishes tensions will 
abate as well said the official asking not to be identified 
we have supported and encouraged the efforts of the nations of 
eastern and central europe to become freer more independent and 
more prosperous he said 
we have believed and believe now that movement in this 
direction will create a more stable and secure europe that is in 
everyones interest including those of the ussr 
still the official said the package of economic incentives 
announced by bush will almost certainly disappoint the poles when 
implemented the measures could lead to perhaps only a marginal 
expansion in polish exports to the united states and us private 
investment in poland as well as some debt relief 
all of the steps are linked to the actual carrying out of 
polands political and economic reforms 
and as the official noted the united states and other allied 
countries can have only a peripheral impact on ending polands 
acute economic distress 
no outsider can save poland the official said 
nonetheless the mood now early in the bush administration 
contrasts markedly with the situation almost eight years ago not 
long after ronald reagan became president 
at the time poland declared martial law and the brief 
experiment in independent trade unionism there was crushed it was 
a time when reagan responded by imposing economic sanctions against 
poland when there were fears that a soviet invasion might be 
imminent 
bush acknowledged on monday how much things have changed in the 
interim not only in poland but elsewhere in the east bloc 
the winds of change are shaping a new european destiny he 
said eastern europe is awakening to yearnings for democracy 
independence and prosperity

the house has voted overwhelmingly to repeal 
major portions of the hatch act and let federal civil service 
employees participate in partisan political activity on their own 
time 
despite the 29790 house vote monday final enactment into law 
is far from certain the house approved an almost identical bill 
last year but it died in the senate 
the administration is opposed to the bill and attorney general 
dick thornburgh has said he will recommend a veto should it reach 
president bushs desk 
the measure was pushed strongly by various unions representing 
federal workers and their leaders were quick to praise the house 
members who voted for it 
this is not a political party issue its a political 
freedom issue said robert m tobias president of the national 
treasury employees union we urge the senate to join the house in 
standing firmly on the side of rights for federal workers

poor families face a shrinking number of 
lowcost homes and apartments even as federal spending and the 
number of families aided rises according to a private study 
more of the poor had to pay more for housing because of soaring 
costs from 1978 to 1985 said the study titled a place to call 
home 
the study was produced by two groups that generally advocate 
increased funds for social programs the center on budget and 
policy priorities and the low income housing information service 
the authors used data from a 1985 housing survey 
the study said the proportion of poor renting families who pay 
at least 60 percent of their income for rent and utilities rose 
from 44 percent in 1978 to 55 percent in 1985 
the number of houses and apartments available for a monthly rent 
of 250 or less 30 percent of the income of a family making 
10000 a year was 97 million in 1970 or 24 million more than 
the comparable number of families 
in 1978 there were still 370000 more units than families but 
by 1985 the number of families had risen to 116 million while the 
number of houses and apartments available at 250 or less had 
fallen to 79 million a deficit of 37 million affordable housing 
units of the 79 million 800000 were vacant and 15 million were 
occupied by families with incomes above the poverty line

the house has passed legislation to make the 
martin luther king jr federal holiday commission a permanent 
agency with authorized spending of 500000 a year 
the legislation sponsored by rep john conyers dmich passed 
the house monday on a 30584 vote a similar measure is pending in 
the senate which failed to act before adjourning last year on a 
housepassed bill to make the commission permanent 
the commission was established by congress in 1984 to 
institutionalize the federal holiday in honor of the slain civil 
rights leader authorization for the commission expires may 1 
conyers told the house on monday that the commission is needed 
more now than ever before because most young people have no 
firsthand knowledge of the civil rights movement 
while the commission has received no federal funds in the past 
conyers and other supporters of the bill argued that the 500000 
annual authorization is needed because private funds for the 
panels work have been drying up 
the senate bill sponored by sen sam nunn dga would extend 
the commission for five years at a cost of 15 million

an american biologist has embarked 
on a twoyear effort to help malaysia save from extinction a 
species of sea turtle that scientists say has been around for at 
least 150 million years 
jeanne a mortimer assistant professor at the archie carr 
center for sea turtle research at the university of florida in 
gainesville arrived in february to work on saving the endangered 
giant leatherback turtle 
she said in a telephone interview today that the world wide fund 
for nature and the malaysian fisheries department asked for her 
help after she attended a conference on turtles in kuala lumpur in 
1987 
we want to increase the success rate of the hatcheries 
besides educating the public on how to treat the leatherbacks 
said ms mortimer who has worked on similar projects in costa 
rica nicaragua mexico brazil pakistan and thailand 
the turtles which reach as much as 6 feet in diameter and 
1100 pounds roam the seas as far away as japan australia and the 
philippines and live as long as 100 years 
between june and august they return to lay their eggs on eight 
miles of sandy beach on the south china sea at rantau abang 180 
miles northeast of kuala lumpur 
ms mortimer said that in the 1950s about 2000 of the giant 
leatherback turtles whose scientific name is demochlys coriacca 
came ashore to lay eggs last year however just 40 to 50 returned 
the alarming decline in the turtles numbers has been attributed 
to pollution pilfering of eggs and disturbance by tourists 
officials say some leatherbacks mistake plastic bags for jelly 
fish the staple of their diet and choke to death 
some malaysians eat the turtles eggs which are a little 
smaller than tennis balls because they think it will improve their 
sexual prowess 
ms mortimer said she will conduct courses for hatchery workers 
tourist guides and the public on how to treat leatherbacks 
also hatchery workers will be on hand when the turtles return 
to lay their eggs and will build fences around them 
maylasia recently passed a law that bans eating the eggs and 
their collection unless they are gathered for hatching 
since 1961 the fisheries department has collected endangered 
eggs and reburied them after about 55 days baby turtles emerge 
and are released into the sea 
about 450000 turtles have been released like this but only one 
in 1000 survive to reach adulthood because other sea creatures 
prey on them scientists say the turtles lay between nine to 14 
eggs at a time and visit the beach five to nine times during the 
season

mother for the trading scheme but complained of her treatment of 
him 
i was essentially raised by livein maids and relatives i 
was conceptualized to save a bad marriage i watch you try to 
kill yourself twice you have never been there for me when the 
chips were down he wrote 
when i cried on the phone you called me a sniveling wimp

god 
on oct 27 1987 he expressed concern for his family none of 
these people deserve me i have put all of their futures in 
jeopardy my relationship with my mother has been destroyed i fear 
i have placed my family at considerable financial risk ie i am 
broke and they my children have no inheritance left because of my 
action christine says i have put the family last and i have there 
really is only one choice now 
nov 8 after being stopped by a policeman for speeding and not 
getting a ticket markle wrote i had a real sense that god had 
intervened and that perhaps that was a sign of something that pm 
i was pretty low and just turned it over to god that seemed to 
work 
on nov 10 i know i have done wrong by my stealing and the 
contempt i have for the system i am sorry for all the pain it has 
inflicted on my wife and children 
nov 11 god give me the sign more and more i am just giving 
it over to god when i get scared 
the letter said that markles problems at work worsened when his 
mother sent telegrams telling stephens officials she hadnt known 
what her son was doing with her account he wrote i wished youd 
never done a lot of things you did night mother 
ms mccambridge appeared in the pulitzer prizewinning play 
night mother in that play the mothers daughter committed 
suicide

names he wrote that ms mccambridge was on location in arizona for 
the movie johnnie guitar when she and joan crawford were both 
drinking and fighting like hell in some incident he mentioned 
sterling hayden physically separating you after joan had thrown a 
gin bottle at you 
the letters last page included this is this clear to you 
that you have hurt every member of my family that you have hurt 
me that i stood by you under some really adverse conditions and 
that you have never done anything but manipulate me for your 
purposes

thousands of striking teachers have forced up 
to half the countrys public schools to close and vowed to stay out 
until their wages are doubled and their union is purged of 
corruption 
the national education workers coordinate a dissident group 
within the national education workers union went on strike monday 
claiming the support of about half of mexicos 11 million public 
school teachers 
there were no reports of violence 
the strike will last indefinitely until we obtain a positive 
response to our demands said coordinate leader teodoro palomino 
he said 8000 schools in mexico city and in 21 of mexicos 31 
states had suspended classes 
education secretary manuel bartlett threatened unspecified 
punitive measures against the teachers 
we must all meet our responsibilities if not we suffer the 
consequences he said monday night in an interview on the 
televisa television network its not legitimate to strike to 
resolve internal labor problems it damages education in this 
country 
according to government figures 254 million students attend 
public schools 
the coordinate on sunday rejected a government offer to increase 
pay by 10 percent and fringe benefits by 18 percent 
teachers make about 150 a month and president carlos salinas de 
gortari has acknowledged that they are badly underpaid but he says 
the government cannot afford the coordinates demand of a 100 
percent raise 
coordinate leaders also demand democratization of the 
national education workers union mexicos largest union and the 
removal of union leaders they claim are corrupt 
jobs within the union have for decades been considered posts to 
reward loyal officials of salinas institutional revolutionary 
party pri which has governed the country since it was formed 60 
years ago 
the strikers accuse union leader carlos jongitud barrios a pri 
senator and other union officials of rigging union elections and 
taking bonuses and other perks while the rankandfile was 
suffering the effects of mexicos 7yearold economic crisis 
since taking office on dec 1 salinas has tried to restore 
public confidence in his party by ordering the arrests of the head 
of the oil workers union and a leading stockbroker on corruption 
and other charges 
a recent study by the liberal magazine proceso said 80 percent 
of mexico citys 100000 grammar school teachers could not afford 
homes or cars 
nearly all had to work at extra jobs and many drove taxis to 
make ends meet according to the magazine 
theyve turned us into peddlers said juan buendia a 
teacher at jose clemente orozco elementary school in atizapan 
some of us sell things on the street to buy chalk and erasers for 
the students 
the government increased salaries by an average 20 percent last 
year when inflation ran at 519 percent

a private college wrongfully dismissed a 
nursing student when it forced her to leave the school because she 
did not lose weight a federal jury ruled 
the jury monday told salve regina college in newport to pay 
sharon russell 30515 for tuition and wages she was deprived of 
while completing her nursing degree at a school in west hartford 
conn 
no one has the right to put any student through what i went 
through said russell 24 hopefully it will deter this from 
happening again 
russell weighed 328 pounds in her junior year around the time 
she signed an agreement with the roman catholic college that she 
would lose 2 pounds per week for the rest of the academic year or 
drop out she also agreed to regularly attend weight watchers 
meetings 
russell was ultimately given a passing grade and allowed to 
register for her senior year on the understanding she would diet 
during the summer which school attorney steven p snow said she 
did not do 
in the fall of 1985 the college informed russell she would not 
be allowed to return for her senior year it maintained russells 
obesity had interfered with her ability to perform certain clinical 
duties 
a college ought to have the right to establish their own 
standard minimum requirements and enforce those said snow 
the 2775 russell paid for her first semester tution was not 
refunded said her attorney edward t hogan 
the school breached its contract with russell because she 
substantially performed her educational duties and the contract for 
weight reduction said hogan he said she maintained a gradepoint 
average higher than 30 out of a possible 40 and only failed a 
clinical course because of an instructors bias 
snow said russell had difficulty teaching diet classes and with 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
snow said the college had the same right to respond to russells 
overeating as it would if a students performance were affected by 
drugs or alcohol addictions 
i would think that every college in american would be 
concerned about the adverse precedential affects of this ruling 
he said 
russell said students in her class who smoked were not forced to 
sign similar contracts 
russell who said she gained weight after leaving salve regina 
completed her degree at st josephs college where she had to 
repeat her junior year because her salve regina credits for that 
year were not accepted 
russell now a nurse in st petersburg fla said she lost 
substantial weight after she had her stomache stapled in august 
1986 while at student at st josephs she declined to divulge her 
current weight

a doctor has vowed to clear his 
name of fraud charges filed by switzerland despite being barred 
from traveling abroad by a us judge who feared cancer patients 
might die in his absence 
dr rajko medenicas trial on charges of defrauding the swiss 
government of 26 million opened monday in geneva it was recessed 
until wednesday so the swiss judge could consider a defense motion 
for postponement until medenica can attend 
medenica a native of yugoslavia who became an american citizen 
last year was ordered in march to surrender his passport and 
remain in the united states by federal district judge sol blatt jr 
several of medenicas patients had said they might die if the 
doctor were jailed in switzerland and unable to continue his 
treatments 
medenica has developed a form of cancer therapy that tailors 
interferon treatments to individual patients many of whom who have 
been treated unsuccessfully elsewhere 
his patients include former heavyweight boxer muhammad ali who 
was given the treatment for a blood disorder 
during a recent interview the physician said he feels caught 
between his responsibility to his patients and his desire to return 
to europe to clear his name 
as a new american i dont want to start my life by having 
something dirty and something im not responsible for happening in 
europe he said 
the swiss government alleges medenica was responsible for fake 
billing while treating patients including many yugoslavs at a 
state hospital in geneva and a private clinic from 1973 through 
1981 
in 1983 he was sentenced in absentia in yugoslavia to 20 years 
in prison on related charges and his yugoslavian property 
including a seaside villa was confiscated 
while jailed in switzerland for 15 months as authorities 
investigated his case 36 of his patients died according to court 
documents 
medenica was released from the jail in 1984 after former south 
carolina gov john west whose daughter was treated for throat 
cancer by medenica persuaded a judge to grant bond west also 
helped raise much of medenicas 300000 bail 
the doctor then came to hilton head island and with the help of 
south carolinas two us senators strom thurmond and ernest 
hollings fought yugoslavias request for extradition 
medenica 49 strongly denies any fraud he says his records 
show he performed all the services for which he charged even 
giving yugoslavs a 50percent discount the billing he said was 
handled by the yugoslavian consulate and swiss authorities 
i am always concerned about my patients he said one of 
the biggest problems in switzerland was that i was blindly 
looking at the patients and the other people organized the 
billing 
attorney f lee bailey who represented medenica during his 
hearing before blatt in charleston admitted the billing documents 
were false but said they were not fraudulent 
if patient a got 100 worth of services and was charged 50 
and if patient b got charged 100 and got 50 worth at the end of 
the day justice was done but the documents were false he said in 
a telephone interview from boston 
if the swiss proceed with the trial without medenica bailey 
said he will ask blatt to reconsider his order keeping the doctor 
in this country or appeal the ruling to the 4th us district court 
of appeals 
bailey also suggested the swiss case could be tried in the 
united states because it is based largely on documents that would 
allow medenica to attend the trial and tend to his patients he 
said 
in their motion in the swiss court monday medenicas attorneys 
asked for a postponement of eight to 12 months so the doctor could 
train someone to care for his patients in his absence

homeowners should find nonchemical ways to 
keep their grass green instead of using lawn care products that 
have been linked to cancer a consumer group says 
but the professional lawn care association says the industry is 
wellregulated and takes proper care to use products safely 
the report issued by public citizen a nonprofit consumer group 
founded by ralph nader said 12 of the 40 pesticides most often 
used by commercial lawn care firms are suspected human carcinogens 
twentyone of the pesticides can cause longterm health problems 
like birth defects liver kidney or nerve damage 20 can cause 
shortterm ailments similar to flu and 36 have caused eye skin or 
throat irritation the group said 
james brooks spokesman for the lawn care industry group said 
the study was old news and based mostly on isolated incidents 
we have to be registered and certified in most states 
brooks said we are regulated we use chemicals as recommended on 
the label if you follow the procedures and directions and all 
that then they are not going to cause any undue health problems 
dr barry troutman director of education for the lawn 
association said scientific evidence indicates the products dont 
cause adverse health effects when used as directed by the 
environmental protection agency 
he criticized the study for being too anecdotal and not 
sciencebased 
the study written by laura weiss calls on the epa to 
ban lawn care pesticides suspected of causing cancer 
conduct a comprehensive exposure study for all lawn care 
chemicals speed up testing for neurotoxic effects of all 
pesticides and their inert ingredients and take regulatory action 
to protect consumers 
require lawn care companies to provide customers with 
government information on the known and potential health effects of 
lawn care pesticides 
ensure that federal agencies take decisive action against lawn 
care companies that make false or misleading claims about the 
safety of their products 
appropriate funds for programs that promote use of nonchemical 
pest control systems 
alicia tenuta spokeswoman for the epa said the agency had not 
seen the study and could not comment on it

exercise yard monday morning the crafts rear rotor became tangled 
in the 12foot fence surrounding the metropolitan correctional 
center 
had he not hit the fence he would have escaped said warden 
john clark 
the crash left kramer with a broken right leg pilot charles 
clayton stevens 34 of gold beach ore suffered two broken legs 
and facial injuries 
they were taken to jackson memorial hospital where they were 
listed in guarded but stable condition today 
although stevens once spoke of his love for working in a hostile 
environment he was known to regulars at nearby tamiami airport as 
a nervous airman with a student pilots license 
he was very squirrelly on the helicopter said paul barth 
president of biscayne helicopters inc we sort of stayed away 
from him 
other experienced pilots wondered about stevens selection of 
the twoseat bell 471a helicopter to try to snatch kramer who is 
serving life without parole for distributing half a million pounds 
of marijuana throughout the midwest 
in my opinion that would not be the kind of bird to use 
said airport patrolman rich fisher thats an observation 
helicopter its no work horse its a lightduty slowmoving 
machine 
calvin r coady a flight instructor for aris helicopters ltd 
of san jose calif said stevens paid him 35000 in cash for the 
37yearold helicopter dec 17 
i remember it very well the majority of the money was 100 
bills with a few 50s coady said adding that the large amount 
of cash made him suspicious but that he didnt ask stevens about 
its source 
most of the 1000 prisons inmates are awaiting federal trial 
the 36yearold kramer was being held in a special highsecurity 
area because he was considered an escape risk 
we are not surprised to hear of the attempted escape after 
all mr kramer is a man of tremendous wealth facing a life 
sentence said tom cash special agent in charge of the drug 
enforcement agency in miami but we never anticipated the 
method 
the dea in february warned the us marshals office that kramer 
might be planning to break out cash said kramer would have no 
problem financing an escape he said 
we estimate that kramer made about 60 million in drug 
smuggling cash said we only confiscated 20 million in cash 
and we know he used offshore banks 
the brazen escape attempt unfolded like the 1975 charles bronson 
movie breakout 
that movie has given everybody the idea that escaping prison 
in a helicopter is a piece of cake cash said 
stevens dropped low enough for kramer to jump onto one of the 
landing skids the helicopter started to rise but then caught its 
rear rotor in the wire atop the fence around the 50by200foot 
exercise area and crashed 
kramer was sentenced after his conviction in illinois with 
former carracing star randy lanier on charges of running a 
multimillion dollar potsmuggling ring 
he was brought to the prison outside miami to face a 
marijuanasmuggling indictment in fort lauderdale and a miami gun 
charge 
us marshal dan horgan said kramer now faces an attempted 
escape charge which carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
prison and stevens faces charges of aiding an escape 
in an interview last summer with the world newspaper of coos 
bay ore stevens said he was a sea diver who harvested sea 
urchins albacore clams kelp mussels and oysters for export to 
japan 
my goal is to make money he told the newspaper he added 
that although he could make as much as 1500 a day as a diver he 
wasnt in the business only for the money 
im trained for that environment he said its exciting 
an adrenaline high its just such a hostile environment i love 
it 
he also said the diamond earring he wears would one day pay for 
his funeral

the tamil tigers separatist guerrillas 
have appointed a sri lankanborn british tamil to start peace talks 
with the sinhalesedominated government officials and tamil 
sources said today 
anton balasingham recently named head of the political section 
of the liberation tigers of tamil eeelam was expected to arrive 
here from london in the next couple of days sources close to 
the rebels said 
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
in a surprise move during the weekend the tigers declared they 
were ready to begin peace talks with president ranasinghe premadasa 
the declaration came after the tigers were blamed for three days 
of bombings that killed at least 79 people 
so far there has been no explanation for the sudden change of 
heart by the largest tamil guerrilla group 
the tamil sources said balasinghams first mission is to talk 
with the government about a time and place for the talks after 
that he will be a member of the tigers negotiating team the 
sources added 
evans cooray premadasas press secretary said the presidents 
office was notified shortly before midnight monday that balasingham 
had been designated to make arrangements for the talks cooray said 
the message was contained in a telex from the tigers information 
office in london 
premadasa who took office in january had offered to start 
talks with both the tigers and sinhalese militants about ending the 
ethnic violence that has claimed more than 12600 lives in this 
onceidyllic indian ocean island since 1983 
the sinhalese extremists whose group is called the peoples 
liberation front have not responded to the sinhalese presidents 
call 
sinhalese have dominated sri lankas government and military 
since the island formerly called ceylon became independent from 
britain in 1948 mostly buddhists they make up 75 percent of the 
countrys 16 million people 
tamils who are mostly hindus comprise 18 percent and say they 
are discriminated against in jobs and education 
efforts by premadasas predecessor president junius r 
jayewardene to make peace with the tamil separatists spurred a 
violent backlash by ultranationalist sinhalese who said the 
government was offering too many concessions to the tamils

the alaska public radio network board has 
decided to return 32283 that exxon corp had donated to help the 
network cover the exxon valdez oil spill 
i think there is a perceived conflict of interest network 
executive director diane kaplan told the board at an emergency 
meeting monday i believe it would be inappropriate for us to 
accept it 
exxon officials said late last week that the oil company had 
sent the network a check after they learned state legislators were 
considering a supplemental budget request for the money 
network officials said at the time that they would accept the 
check and that they did not consider it an ethical issue 
exxon the owner of the tanker that ran aground last month and 
spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil into prince william 
sound has underwritten network programs in the past as have other 
oil companies 
exxons oilspill contribution however was unusual in that it 
was provided as reimbursement for coverage of a specific news event 
in which it has been accused of negligence 
kaplan stressed that network officials did not ask exxon or the 
legislators for the money and that accepting it would not have 
compromised news coverage by the networks member stations 
however the board agreed that the appearance of a conflict of 
interest could jeopardize the networks credibility the sixmember 
board voted unanimously to return the check with a letter of thanks 
to exxon 
exxon spokeswoman jan cool said the company understood the 
boards reasoning 
our intentions were entirely honorable she said we 
certainly wouldnt have made the grant if we felt we were putting 
the public broadcasting network in any kind of compromising 
position

the indictment of house speaker jim 
wright on charges of violating house rules did little to shake the 
trust held in him by many in the district hes represented more 
than 30 years 
if somebody goes to him and asks for help not to pay a bribe 
if you go to jim wright hell do his job hell help you said 
ed brown who manages silver spur saloon in the fort worth 
stockyards a historic district revitalized with federal aid won by 
wright 
the house ethics committee issued a report monday citing 69 
alleged violations of house rules by wright including accepting 
nearly 145000 in gifts and planning to avoid limits on outside 
income 
i give somebody the benefit of the doubt until its proven 
that hes done something more than anybody else up there said 
mike smith owner of the paris coffee shop where a steady stream 
of fort worth politicos business workers senior citizens and 
hospital employees flow from early morning until midafternoon 
wright often stops in the shop during visits to fort worth a 
picture of him hangs on the wall 
while friends voiced their support for wright others said he 
should receive the same treatment given another texan former us 
sen john tower in washington recently 
i think hes guilty and they ought to hang him just like 
tower said businessman gary dempsey 
i think hes guilty said tish lucas a housing and urban 
development employee here any time a woman takes 18000 a year 
and a cadillac when shes living in washington dc when the jobs 
are here that doesnt make sense lucas said referring to 
allegations that wrights wife was paid a salary but did little 
work 
but mike price director of fort worths greenwood funeral home 
disagreed 
being a republican and looking at it from that viewpoint i 
think what he did is not that bad price said i think the 
committee is just vindictive and theyre just out to get him they 
havent liked jim wright since he got elected speaker of the house 
theyre just trying to get rid of him 
and others staunchly defended the 17term democratic congressman 
mayor bob bolen said he thought the house ethics committee came 
up with very little against the speaker 
its staggering to me unless there is something they 
havent disclosed that its taken two months and 2 million and 
almost paralyzed congress to find these very minor infractions 
bolen said 
really the type of things that hes done dont bother me that 
much said mara hoyler an employee of the texas cycling journal 
what bothers me is if theyre going to do such an investigation 
with him they should do it to everyone 
its a texas massacre mrs hoyler said first it was 
tower now wright i think its more of a texas problem than a 
political one i think the other states are out to get us

finance minister shimon peres turned aside a 
challenge to his leadership of the leftleaning labor party at a 
marathon meeting where he came under stiff criticism for his peace 
policies and for losing the last national elections 
the 12hour session of labors central committee on monday 
underscored widening dissatisfaction with peres handling of 
israels second largest party 
peres came under attack mainly from four party officials and 
cabinet ministers who have already announced or indicated 
intentions to try to unseat him at the partys convention in 1990 
but the challengers never brought their proposals to a vote and 
peres boasted today that the meetings result amounted to backing 
for his leadership 
defense minister yitzhak rabin a longtime rival of peres did 
not speak at the meeting analysts believe he would be the most 
serious challenger to peres if he steps forward at the convention 
next year 
one of the challengers former party secretary uzi baram said 
the party needed a more dovish platform and should support peace 
talks with every palestinian who recognizes israel including the 
plo 
the israeli government rules out talks with the plo which it 
considers a terrorist organization 
peres is more dovish than shamir in his peace policies but he 
backs the refusal to talk to the plo the party platform expresses 
that view but there are growing voices for a more flexible approach 
three other challengers to peres who have also urged conditional 
talks with the plo focused on labors electoral loss to the 
rightwing likud bloc of prime minister yitzhak shamir 
likud edged out labor 40 to 39 seats in the 120member 
parliament last november labor later joined likud as a junior 
partner in a broadbased coalition government 
peres foreign minister in the last joint government took the 
finance job this time aiming to help his movements ailing 
collective farms and industries however the new job has virtually 
locked him out of influencing foreign policy 
we have to analyze our failures we have to correct them 
people should realize that its time to change leadership said 
mordechai gur a minister without portfolio 
there was an ideological failure an organizational failure 
and a failure of leadership said iraqiborn energy minister 
moshe shahal another challenger the fourth was communications 
minister gad yaacobi 
i know there is not a good feeling or mood in the party 
peres responded speaking to the 1300 party delegates at a tel 
aviv convention hall 
those who feel that i should continue vote for me and those 
feeling that someone else should vote for him peres said 
he told army radio today that the results clearly left him in 
charge i never received a vote of confidence like at this 
meeting peres said

former house speaker thomas p tip 
oneill defended his besieged successor calling jim wright the 
most honest and decent man i know 
the house ethics committee on monday formally charged the texas 
democrat with 69 violations including trying to evade limits on 
outside earnings 
jim wright would never do anything he thought was wrong or was 
breaking the rules of the congress oneill said monday 
oneill said perceptions of ethical behavior have changed since 
the nixon years and few people would survive the intense scrutiny 
focused on those in public life today 
he also criticized the committee for hiring a professional 
prosecutor to investigate wright 
hes just out there to see if he could nail someone oneill 
said here he is with 69 particulars you only do that with a 
grand jury theyre treating jim differently than they ever treated 
anybody else i feel sorry for jim wright 
one charge accuses wright with using a book he wrote 
reflections of a public man to evade limits on outside income 
the committee says he sold a large quantity of the book to a group 
claiming the payment as royalties 
oneill said he believed the sale could have been accomplished 
by wrights staff without his knowledge 
he called other charges technical ommissions little items a 
public official may forget to report putting him in violation of 
various rules 
wright is the most honest and decent man i know the retired 
massachusetts democrat said during a speaking engagement here 
oneill said he believes committee members had to come up with 
the charges to justify the 15 million they spent on the 
investigation which has gone on for most of a year 
they chase after so many things out there especially with the 
leadership said oneill there are not many people who you 
cant go over tooth and nail and find something were being 
overinvestigated

nothing is certain but death taxes and lastminute income tax 
returns and two extra days to file didnt change that for millions 
of americans 
filers jammed post offices irs information centers and 
accountants offices on monday 
human nature doesnt change because they have two more days 
said helen adorjan an illinois revenue department spokeswoman 
they just procrastinate two more days 
time for dithering ran out at midnight monday because april 15 
fell on a weekend many people were grateful for the reprieve 
i got it done sunday night said dennis de la mata of 
chicago the extra two days made a big difference this is the 
first time in nine years that i filed on time 
businesses that thrive on tax season also found reason to cheer 
were taking in more clients a lot of new clients said 
idelle rubino a receptionist at the hampr block office near the 
university of california san francisco medical center more 
time to pay means more wont take the time to do it themselves 
until the last minute 
long lines and traffic jams surrounded many post offices but 
some people found ways to ease the strain 
los angeles rock station klsxfm offered coffee and donuts at 
the downtown terminal annex the citys main mail processing 
center which posted buckets at curbside until midnight 
we want to add some merriment and not make the people feel bad 
that theyre procrastinators said klsx disc jockey peter tilden 
the home of the dallas cowboys saw unusual offseason activity 
as the internal revenue service set up shop at the texas stadium 
ticket office irs officials passed out advice while a pizza 
delivery service passed out free pies and an entertainer in mickey 
mouse costume helped ease tensions 
in pittsburgh the first game of the national hockey leagues 
patrick division finals between the penguins and the philadelphia 
flyers apparently helped prevent a late filing crunch 
its been crazy but good it was a little more congested last 
year supervisor don smith said at the downtown post office we 
had people dropping off their returns on their way to the hockey 
game 
protesters with complaints about how the government will spend 
the tax checks also gathered at filing points 
in san francisco members of the berkeleybased northern 
california war tax resistance distributed 6000 from people who 
refused to pay all or part of their taxes because they contend 60 
percent of federal income taxes are used for war and war 
preparations 
the philadelphia jobs with peace campaign protested quietly 
outside the citys main post office by displaying model tanks guns 
and bombers and six placardwaving members of the libertarian 
party flanked lines of cars outside the main post office in tuscon 
ariz urging people to support abolition of the income tax 
george paris who says he is homeless but paid taxes on his 
earnings from parttime jobs stood near the birmingham ala post 
office holding a sign reading build homes not bombs 
an estimated 6 million americans were expected to file their 
income taxes on monday according to the irs 
not everyone had to have their returns in the mail last night 
residents of rhode island new hampshire maine connecticut 
upstate new york and massachusetts got an extra day because monday 
was the patriots day holiday in massachusetts they have until 
tonight to mail returns to the irs office at andover mass 
but already irs officials elsewhere were busy planning for next 
year they will hold a public meeting a week from today in 
indianapolis for suggestions on how the agency can do its job 
better

prosecutors filed bribery charges today against a 
former senior government official caught up in the recruit 
stockprofiteering scandal and said they will now focus the 
investigation on politicians 
aides of prime minister noboru takeshita and former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone profited in the stock deals but both 
men have denied any personal wrongdoing 
the scandal has seriously eroded public confidence in the 
takeshita government and support for the prime minister fell below 
4 percent in a poll by kyodo news service last week 
the tokyo district public prosecutors office today charged 
kunio takaishi 59 a former vice minister of education who was 
arrested on march 28 
he was the 14th person all businessmen or bureaucrats 
arrested so far in the scandal 
all now have been formally charged and prosecutors said they 
would turn their attention from bureaucracys part in the scandal 
to the role of politicians 
takaishi is accused of receiving bribes from recruit co and 
providing favors for the information and publishing conglomerate 
others who have been charged include recruit founder hiromasa 
ezoe takashi kato a former vice minister of labor and hisashi 
shinto former chairman of japans telecommunications giant nippon 
telegraph and telephone corp 
recruit sold unlisted stocks in a subsidiary at bargain prices 
to about 160 influential politicians public officials and 
businessmen the buyers profited handsomely when the shares were 
listed for public trading and shot up in price 
according to a 1988 supreme court decision the sale of stock 
bound to rise in price and not available to the general public 
could amount to bribery 
at least 17 politicians including takeshita and nakasone have 
been linked to the scandal directly or through stock purchases by 
aides 
in addition takeshita has acknowledged receiving more than 1 
million in political contributions from recruit in 1986 and 1987 
but has said the donations all were legal 
despite repeated demands from opposition parties that he resign 
and call elections to allow a public judgment takeshita has vowed 
to stay on and push for political reforms 
passage of the budget for this fiscal year which began april 1 
has been blocked by an opposition boycott of parliament in support 
of demands that takeshita resign or call nakasone to parliament for 
questioning about his role in the affair

the dollar fluctuated in a narrow range in 
extremely thin european trading late this morning as the market 
awaited key us inflation statistics 
gold prices moved up 
the release today of the us consumer price index for march was 
likely to give an indication as to whether there was any room for 
the us federal reserve to ease monetary policy traders said 
one rome trader said a rise in the index could lead the fed to 
tighten monetary policy and the dollar would rise 
another rome trader said market sentiment toward the dollar was 
neutral and that it was uncertain that the inflation report would 
move the dollar out the doldrums

authorities said they found a note 
asking gods forgiveness inside a mans bloodsplattered car hours 
after he killed five people and shortly before he slit the throats 
of his three young daughters 
other new details also emerged about the bloody rampage in which 
seven people died including allegations that winery worker ramon 
salcido had tried to kill the wife of a coworker but his gun 
jammed 
salcido continued to elude authorities today as a 5dayold 
manhunt stretched from canada to mexican 
the note written in spanish was found inside the car along with 
a 22caliber semiautomatic pistol and salcidos social security 
card according to documents filed monday in federal court in san 
francisco 
forgive me god but this law made me do it we could live 
better me and my children but what can i do said the note filed 
in support of an fbi request for a warrant charging salcido with 
unlawful flight to avoid prosection a magistrate granted the 
warrant 
officials did not say what this law meant but salcido 
reportedly was upset by a court order last week to pay nearly 
6000 in overdue child support and to make monthly payments of 
511 for a 4yearold daughter in fresno 
police found the car friday afternoon in a san rafael alley 
about 15 miles south of petaluma near where his daughters were 
found saturday 
police believe two of the girls were slain friday night and left 
at a trash dump salcidos 3yearold daughter carmina survived 
despite having her throat slashed from eartoear 
carmina listed in stable condition at petaluma valley hospital 
was asked by a detective what occurred at the dump cut her cut 
her twice the girl said making a slicing motion with her hand 
across her throat according to the documents 
the detective then asked if her father did it she responded 
yeah yeah and began to cry five minutes later she said 
spontaneously dad hurt me according to the court papers 
carmina is under armed guard at the hospital where gifts 
continued to pour in 
her 28yearold father described by some as friendly and good 
worker and by others as an insanely jealous heavy drinker who used 
cocaine and toted a gun has not been positively sighted despite 
hundreds of calls from across california and as far away as maine 
authorities said 
murder charges were filed monday in sonoma county against 
salcido in connection with the slayings of his wife angela 24 
and daughters sofia 4 and teresa 1 and of coworker tracy 
toovey 
the court papers said 33yearold kenneth butti who survived an 
attack outside his ranch friday told a detective salcido had tried 
to shoot buttis wife but the gun malfunctioned 
butti said he could hear the click as the hammer fell but 
that there was no explosion according to the court papers 
no charges have been filed in the three other slayings of 
salcidos motherinlaw marian louise richards 47 and her 
daughters ruth 12 and marie 8 authorities believe they mrs 
salcido and toovey were killed friday morning 
although photos and descriptions of the 5foot9 180pound 
salcido have been circulated at california airports and border 
guards sonoma county sheriff richard michaelsen speculated salcido 
hasnt strayed far 
my best guess is that hes laying low said michaelsen 
were assuming hes in our county or in marin county he may be 
holed up waiting for the media attention to ease up 
however fbi spokesman chuck latting acknowleged that salcido 
who entered the united states illegally but is a legal resident 
could try to slip back to his native mexico 
to aid the search a 15000 reward has been posted 
the uncertainty and the slayings have left many county residents 
tense 
people are real scared around here said dorothy mccann a 
grocery store clerk who lives in glen ellen with her boyfriend 
we have a loaded gun in the cupboard people are just looking at 
each other

students mourning the death of reformist leader 
hu yaobang staged a sitin today at the great hall of the people 
the seat of government to demand greater democracy a free press 
and more money for education 
about 3000 students from at least five beijing universities 
marched to tiananmen square and about 1000 sat outside the great 
hall refusing to leave unless authorities agree to meet with them 
and publish their grievances 
in shanghai more than 1500 students marched during the night 
chanting prodemocracy slogans 
the student marches were the largest in china since 198687 
prodemocracy protests that resulted in hus forced resignation as 
communist party chief 
they reflected not just grief at hus death but students 
unhappiness with their living conditions and bleak career prospects 
in beijing student representatives were allowed inside the 
great hall to present their demands but emerged shortly after noon 
to say that the only response had been to go home 
police kept a low profile throughout the day and made no effort 
to stop the demonstrations 
hu who died of a heart attack saturday at age 73 is a hero of 
chinese students because he was considered a champion of the rights 
of intellectuals 
he was forced to resign in early 1987 after being accused by 
party conservatives of failing to take harsh measures against the 
prodemocracy student demonstrations of december 1986 and january 
1987 
todays beijing protest became increasingly political in nature 
as the day went on with students who carried banners and wreathes 
dedicated to hu chanting long live democracy down with 
dictatorship overthrow bureaucracy down with corruption 
students from beijing university and peoples university were 
later joined by demonstrators from qinghua university a prominent 
engineering school the nationalities university the beijing 
school of economics and other schools 
the student representatives allowed inside the great hall 
demanded repudiation of past official campaigns against liberalism 
freedom of speech and of the press more money for education and 
abolition of beijing regulations against street demonstrations 
they also demanded that senior leaders reveal their incomes and 
that the communist party reassess its ouster of hu 
march leaders placed a 15foot banner in hus honor on a 
monument in tiananmen to revolutionary heroes 
one student climbed onto the monument and demanded the 
resignation of the communist partys ruling politburo a 22member 
body the students cheered wildly and also cheered his call for a 
reassessment of hu and a government apology for past unspecified 
mistakes 
the students were surrounded by a crush of thousands of curious 
chinese workers and peasants many from outside beijing who were 
visiting tiananmen square chinas symbolic center of power and a 
main sightseeing attraction 
students sang the internationale and national anthem and 
chanted oppose dictatorship down with corruption overthrow 
bureaucracy long live democracy 
several hours after they began their protest under a hot sun 
the head of the legislatures visitors department luo xiaozha 
came out and told the students their demands are too big for one 
person to decide on right away he promised to report them to 
members of the legislatures standing committee 
beijing university vice president luo haocai urged them to 
return to campus and rest the students booed both officials 
and said they would disperse only if authorities agreed to publish 
a full account of their grievances in the staterun media and 
arrange a meeting for them with the legislative standing committee 
there was no immediate response to the new demands 
we are disappointed in deng xiaoping one peoples 
university student said of chinas senior leader who first promoted 
hu but later joined in ousting him a few years ago we supported 
him but in his later years he has made many mistakes just like 
mao tsetung 
mao leader of chinas revolution is officially acknowledged to 
have made a catastrophic mistake in allowing the 196676 cultural 
revolution a violent far lefist campaign in which thousands of 
people were killed or injured and tens of thousands had their 
careers destroyed 
the student said the 84yearold deng like mao has become 
reluctant to give up power and unwilling to brook any opposition 
jason hurpado of portland ore an english teacher at 
shanghais fudan university said the overnight demonstration in 
that city broke up shortly after students reached party 
headquarters

sudanese rebels claim to have captured a 
strategic garrison town in southern sudan where an international 
relief effort is trying to avert 100000 famine deaths 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army in a radio spla 
broadcast monitored in nairobi said they had taken the town of bor 
on monday and wiped out its garrison 
remnants are being mopped up in the forest around the town 
the rebels said in the broadcast monday 
bor lies in the heart of the southern sudanese region targeted 
by a uncoordinated relief effort that hopes to deliver before 
rains begin next month may enough food to feed 23 million people 
until october when the rains traditionally end 
failure of the project could mean starvation for 100000 people 
say relief officials who estimate that more than 250000 southern 
sudanese died in 1988 due to war and the famine it created 
however un officials now concede less than half their 
original target of 105000 tons will be met due to bureaucracy 
sluggish donor support and poor planning 
bor is about 125 miles north of juba a town key in the 132 
million relief effort and the governments last major stronghold in 
the south 
the rebels took up arms against sudans moslemdominated 
government in khartoum in 1983 demanding autonomy and more 
economic development for the predominantly christian and animist 
africandescended south

customs inspectors seized one of the few eastern 
jets still flying and fined the strikecrippled airline 12 
million after finding 75 pounds of cocaine in a mail bag in the 
cargo hold 
the boeing 727 confiscated on monday was the 14th eastern 
jetliner seized since september for transporting the drug into the 
country the fine is in addition to nearly 3 million owed from 
previous drugrelated violations 
eight previous drug shipments were in bags similar to the sack 
in which the cocaine was found saturday 
the plane landed saturday at the end of a trip that included 
stops in paraguay bolivia peru and panama said customs spokesman 
michael sheehan 
on top of the fine customs demanded a letter of credit from the 
carrier before releasing the plane 
we hate to kick an airline while its down sheehan said 
but we will not allow illegal drugs into the country 
last month the miamibased airline filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in new york 
customs cashed three previous credit letters worth about 3 
million out of concern over easterns financial troubles 
normally customs holds the letters until it negotiates an accord 
on the fine with the airline 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak expressed anger over the 
seizure and the decision by customs to cash the credit letters 
she said customs would have to go to bankruptcy court to get its 
money 
we dont think that fining airlnes and seizing their aircraft 
is the way to stop drug trafficking ms ceremsak said 
were obviously conducting an internal investigation she 
said obviously the people putting things on our aircraft are 
very clever 
she said eastern last year spent 3 million on security and has 
not cut back on security this year despite easterns drop to about 
one tenth of its flight schedule since the start of the machinists 
strike march 4 
in a related development eight former eastern baggage handlers 
went on trial monday on charges of conspiring to smuggle cocaine

where theres no smoke theres ire 
particularly when a public university in this tobaccogrowing state 
tries to limit smoking 
members of the legislatures tobacco task force raised the 
threat of reprisals monday against the university of louisville 
over a policy that took effect march 1 limiting smoking to 
designated areas in 100 campus buildings 
weve got basically some people that are wanting to bite the 
hand that feeds them said sen john rogers 
the task force ordered a study of tobaccos contribution to the 
kentucky treasury and the size of the university of louisvilles 
share the legislature convenes in 1990 to write the budget for 
higher education through 1992 
rep clay crupper who called for the study said his 
tobaccogrowing constituents were angry about a state institutions 
implied hostility toward tobacco 
they pay a lot of taxes said crupper chairman of the house 
agriculture committee ive got letter after letter whatever 
you do dont let them have any of our tax dollars from tobacco 
because they dont deserve it 
dan hall special assistant to university president donald 
swain and larry owsley university vice president for 
administration said the policy was not a slap at tobacco growers 
or discrimination against employees who smoke 
were not on any crusade we are in this to try to regulate a 
situation in a working environment owsley said 
but the task force was unmoved 
you folks remind me a lot of a teenager who needs money but 
youre somewhat embarrassed about your parents rogers said if 
something happens that the money you want is not forthcoming 
then i think that youre going to have to bear a part of the 
burden 
the senator said the smoking restrictions should be scrapped 
if youve got a few people that are squealing because they 
dont like the smoke which do they like the best or the least the 
smoke or the paycheck because tobacco is very instrumental in 
paying their salaries rogers said

the statue shows justice as blind and federal 
appeals judge douglas h ginsburg says it sometimes needs to be 
invisible as well 
ginsburg proved his point by deleting twothirds of his dissent 
in a case before releasing it publicly ginsburg said he was 
withholding 12 of the 18 pages because his opinion was based on 
secret government information the washington post and the 
washington times reported today 
civil liberties lawyers were quick to criticize the highly 
unusual procedural step and one likened it to secret actions of 
the notorious star chamber that existed in england until 1641 
its bad enough to have secret evidence said kate martin 
director of the american civil liberties union project on national 
security litigation his dissent is an effort to write secret 
law 
ginsburgs opinion was issued in a suit alleging the fbi as 
part of its domestic surveillance program of the 1950s and 1960s 
engaged in illegal activity to discredit a new york man who was a 
communist party member 
the plaintiff alleged that government agents planted a 
fictitious report in a car he used causing communist party members 
to think he was a government informant and expel him from the party 
in 1964 
the government wanted the us court of appeals for the district 
of columbia to order a lower court to dismiss the case without 
hearing it because it didnt want to release material that the 
defense wanted to obtain through pretrial discovery proceedings 
the appeals court rejected the government request 
the appeals court majority said the government had not presented 
compelling evidence that disclosure of its activities 20 and 30 
years ago would result in disclosure of state secrets today 
but ginsburg whose nomination to the supreme court was 
withdrawn two years ago after it was revealed he had smoked 
marijuana said the lower court had ignored the governments 
legitimate and compelling interest in preventing disclosure of 
exceedingly sensitive national security information the 
newspaper said 
however major portions of the judges dissent were deleted from 
the version released publicly and also from that given to the 
plaintiffs lawyers only government lawyers were allowed to see 
the full version 
the post and times said court officials could not remember any 
other instances in which the appellate court here had issued a 
secret opinion 
mark lynch former head of the aclu national security project 
told the post this is unusual and goes further than any case im 
aware of on the face of it its troubling our whole system of 
law depends on court decisions being public

herbert hoover didnt get elected this 
way but with his engineers mind he might have liked the 
groundbreaking use of computers for a campus vote today at his alma 
mater 
state and county officials are watching the vote at stanford 
university where the nations 31st president was elected the 
schools first student body treasurer 95 years ago as a test of 
whether computers terminals replacing paper ballots can attract 
voters prevent fraud and keep out hackers 
if turnout is as high as expected the election will be the 
biggest ever taken by computer terminal in the united states 
the election using about 70 universityowned or rented apple 
macintosh computers and software written by a sophomore is 
expected to cost at least 3000 less than the 13000 spent last 
year 
the votes are expected to counted within two hours after the 
polls close wednesday night instead of the five days it took last 
year 
were observing the stanford election as an interesting 
experiment said john mottsmith coordinator of voter outreach 
for the california secretary of state 
among the questions mottsmith and county officials have are how 
user friendly and how secure the system is compared with paper 
ballots that always can be examined and recounted 
the bottom line is the people have to have confidence that the 
system is accurate mottsmith said 
the stanford program developed by sandy aronson requires the 
13000 students eligible to vote to punch in their names and school 
id numbers to prevent them from voting more than once 
if the computer detects that its being tampered with in some 
manner it will make a lot of loud noises and alert the poll 
watcher said steven krauss elections commissioner and a 
sophomore 
other schools using computerized elections have had minor 
problems amid overall encouraging results those involved say at 
boston university last week a disk failure caused 248 of the 3159 
votes cast to go uncounted 
at stanford about 5000 students generally vote krauss said 
nearly 100 candidates are running for various offices 
paper ballots will be used by students at stanfords three 
overseas campuses and by those who refuse to use the computers 
there will probably always be people on campus who dont know 
how to use a mac and are dreadfully afraid of using the machine 
krauss said

district of columbia mayor marion barry was 
noticeably absent when federal drug czar william j bennett held a 
meeting with area officials on his emergency plan to fight the 
capitals drug plague 
bennett insisted monday there was nothing to stop him and barry 
from working together despite bennetts statement a week earlier 
that washingtons drug problem is so out of control that serious 
questions of local politics and governance can no longer be avoided 
or excused 
barry testified before a congressional committee while bennett 
was briefing local officials on his plan to curb drug use and 
drugrelated violence in the district 
washington became the nations murder capital last year with 372 
murders most of them drugrelated so far this year there have 
been 150 slayings compared with 99 at the same time in 1988 
five homicides were recorded monday including one in which a 
female police sergeant was slain by a fire inspector who then 
killed himself in what authorities called a love triangle police 
said it was one of the bloodiest days in the city since seven 
hanafi muslims were killed at their headquarters on jan 18 1973 
barrys effectiveness in the fight has been criticized because 
of his friendship with charles lewis indicted last week on drug 
charges and a federal investigation of his own conduct 
bennett said monday that he had not spoken directly with barry 
since the plan was announced april 10 but he said barry had been 
invited to the meeting and he urged reporters to drop the 
personality issue 
we are not in the process of developing a relationship 
bennett said we are trying to respond to the drug problem this 
issue about whether marion barry and i will stand up in public and 
put our arms around each other is not the issue and you ought to 
get off it 
barry meanwhile was asking the senate appropriations 
committees district of columbia panel to assign 500 federal police 
officers to washingtons police force to handle routine police 
duties while regular city police battle the drug dealers that 36 
million proposal was not included in bennetts plan 
barry also requested congressional help in persuading the navy 
to relinquish land the city seeks for a new prison facility 
bennett had taken the city to task for failing to build a new 
500bed pretrial detention facility although it received 50 
million from congress three years ago to do so construction has 
been held up by court battles 
barry on monday also signed emergency legislation establishing a 
curfew for most teenagers and a temporary ordinance allowing 
police to bar people from gathering on city streets 
the legislation marks the citys second curfew attempt after 
the first one was challenged in court 
bennetts hourlong private meeting monday with the local 
officials was triggered by their confusion over what bennetts plan 
meant to them 
the plan called for creation of a metropolitan area task force 
of law enforcement agents with an additional 57 federal officials 
assigned to the area as well as construction of the pretrial 
detention facility and a 700bed federal prison 
the local officials were concerned about whether the war on 
drugs would end at the district boundary line and whether they 
would get stuck with a new prison or pretrial detention facility 
housing washingtons evildoers 
baltimore mayor kurt schmoke attended the sesion saying 
afterward that there were still many more questions than answers 
today 
but the prison issue was defused somewhat over the weekend when 
bennetts staff reversed earlier statements and said bennett did 
not anticipate the need for two new prisons in maryland one 
federal prison is already being planned in cumberland in allegany 
county 
but the site for the pretrial detention facility has not yet 
been decided and bennett refused to speculate on where it might be 
built 
civil rights leader jesse jackson a critic of bennetts plan as 
being too limited met with bennett later in the day

investigators have found no 
evidence linking two jailed palestinians to the bombing of pan am 
flight 103 even though a similar bomb was seized in a probe of the 
suspected terrorists officials said today 
a 35yearold federal police officer was killed and another was 
critically wounded monday when they tried to disarm the bomb 
alexander prechtel of the federal prosecutors office said 
investigators only have very vague indications the two 
palestinians held by west german authorities may have been involved 
in the pan am disaster 
all 259 people aboard the pan am plane and 11 on the ground died 
in the dec 21 terrorist attack in which a bomb disguised as a 
radiocassette player blew up the jet over lockerbie scotland 
a similar bomb hidden in a radio tuner exploded at the federal 
police headquarters in wiesbaden on monday as two experts were 
trying to defuse it 
the 29yearold officer who survived the blast was fighting for 
his life today said willy terstiege a spokesman for the 
bundeskriminalamt the federal police headquarters 
jochen schroers spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutors office 
involved in the pan am investigation said mondays blast has 
nothing whatsoever to do with our investigation 
the two palestinians alleged members of the popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command remain in 
investigative custody in west germany following their arrest in 
october after what police said was the biggest illegal weapons bust 
in the nations history 
prechtel said the bomb that exploded monday was discovered 
during investigation of the palestinians but he and other 
officials declined to say when or where the explosive device was 
found 
terstiege said two bombs were delivered to the wiesbaden 
headquarters monday by authorities in the west german state of 
north rhinewestphalia where part of the october weapons 
confiscation took place 
security sources who requested anonymity said the bombs were 
discovered in raids on suspected palestinian terrorist hideouts 
they also declined to say when or where the bombs were found 
officials of the hesse state prosecutors office which is 
investigating mondays explosion refused to comment on how similar 
that bomb was to the one that blew up the pan am jet 
investigators in the pan am case have concluded the plane was 
blown out of the sky when a detonator sensitive to changes in air 
pressure set off plastic explosives packed into a radio 
cassetteplayer in a suitcase 
an identically disguised bomb containing czechoslovakmade 
plastic explosives was among the large quantity of weapons and 
explosives seized in october raids of suspected hideouts of the 
popular front in frankfurt and neuss 
police arrested 14 suspects in the october raids but only the 
two remain in custody hafez kassem dalkamoni and abdul fattah 
ghandanfar 
prechtel said they are suspected of trying to set up terrorist 
cells in west germany 
we have no evidence that the two might have been involved in 
the lockerbie bombing prechtel told the associated press in a 
telephone interview from karlsruhe 
british investigators said the pan am explosion was caused by 
the same type of plastic explosive that was found in frankfurt 
he said but they havent given us any proof of this 
cbs news last week cited unidentified us government officials 
as alleging that 21yearold khalid jaafar unwittingly carried the 
bomb aboard the plane in his baggage 
but prechtel said evidence shows that jaafar one of the victims 
of the bombing was innocent 
as far as i know the british have said the bomb was in a hard 
suitcase prechtel said monday mr jaafar seems to be 
innocent we know mr jaafar had two small softcovered bags so 
we have no evidence that someone gave him a bomb

to 95 
taylor a lord justice of appeal said he wants to ensure 
similar tragedies never occur 
in switzerland europes chief soccer executive apologized for 
comparing english fans to wild animals but jacques georges 
president of the european union of football associations also has 
indicated that fans behavior at the club semifinal in sheffield 
may keep british clubs barred from european cup tournaments 
despite a recent vote to readmit them in 1990 
of 170 people injured saturday 25 still are being treated in 
sheffield nineteen are in intensive care 
a coroner was to start an inquest today to determine the cause 
of six of the deaths police have identified all the victims except 
the boy who died today 
newspaper reports indicated the deaths may have been caused by a 
police officers attempt to prevent a fatal accident among fans 
pressing to get into sheffields hillsborough stadium 
in liverpool nine injured fans filed writs in the high court 
seeking damages for personal injuries the writs allege negligence 
or breach of duty against south yorkshire police and the sheffield 
wednesday soccer club whose stadium was the scene of the disaster 
before heading to the stadium taylor held a news conference 
with west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear who is conducting 
a separate inquiry into the actions of south yorkshire police 
i would respectfully say to all those who are disposed to 
comment on this terrible disaster that it would be better for us to 
wait to ascertain the facts before proposing any solutions 
taylor said 
he promised his inquiry will cover all aspects of the tragedy 
including the behavior of fans outside the match policing sports 
ground safety crowd control and government plans to require soccer 
fans carry identity cards 
the focus of the inquiry will be to find out what happened and 
make recommendations as to how this situation can be avoided in the 
future taylor said 
evidence from fans would form an important part of the inquiry 
which will include public hearings he said 
dear said evidence from the police inquiry will be passed to 
taylor and the coroner 
this inquiry is seeking the truth and to cut away the 
mythology that is beginning to grow he said 
the disaster occurred saturday at an english football 
association cup semifinal between liverpool and nottingham forest 
all the victims were liverpool fans either crushed against a 
crowdcontrol fence in front of a standingroomonly terrace or 
trampled or suffocated by the panicked crowd 
officials and fans accuse police of letting thousands of fans 
into the stadium late and then responding too slowly when 
latecomers crushed fans against the 10foothigh fence there also 
are charges some fans had forged tickets or no tickets at all for 
the soldout match at the stadium which has a capacity for 54000 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for

force the collapse of a wall next to the gate 
the judge who headed an inquiry into the 1985 bradford fire when 
56 people died cautioned today that large crowds always breed 
danger and absolute safety can never be guaranteed 
there are no easy solutions you can make recommendation after 
recommendation but at the end of the day there is always a human 
element sir oliver popplewell told the associated press 
balancing the problem of hooliganism with the problems of safety 
and from other sources is a very complex matter 
englands football association gave the goahead monday for the 
cup competition to continue but the liverpool team decided today 
to postpone for one week a decision on whether to participate any 
more this year

a jury rejected a plea of insanity and convicted a 
stockbroker of murdering his former boss one day after being fired 
superior court judge john irwin immediately sentenced 
42yearold lonnie gilchrist to life in prison monday in the 1988 
shooting death of george cook 
the jury which began deliberations on thursday rejected 
gilchrists claim that he was in the grips of a paranoid psychosis 
one day after he was fired in 1988 for not meeting performance 
levels gilchrist entered cooks merrill lynch office and shot the 
regional vice president three times with a 22caliber pistol as 
the executive sat behind his desk 
witnesses said that as cook crawled toward his door crying for 
help gilchrist shot him twice more beat and kicked him and 
yelled no billionaire is going to do this to me 
steven r lively another merrill lynch employee and a former 
boston college football star tackled gilchrist in cooks office 
and held him until authorities arrived 
defense attorney norman zalkind argued that gilchrists 
childhood with an abusive and alcoholic father left him feeling 
persecuted and blaming prejudice for his failures gilchrist who 
is black had gone to the national association for the advancement 
of colored people to file a complaint against merrill lynch 
before the shooting gilchrist completed a 125000 bond 
transaction canceled a dental appointment and told coworkers he 
was going to teach cook a lesson assistant district attorney 
ronald moynahan said gilchrists businessasusual manner showed he 
was in control at the time 
i think its very important that the word go out that our 
criminal justice system is determined by jurors of our peers and 
not by the psychiatrists of the world moynahan said after the 
verdict 
gilchrist graduated from the university of pennsylvanias 
wharton school 
lively who is black quit the firm three months after the 
shooting and filed a complaint with the massachusetts commission 
against discrimination accusing merrill lynch releasing his name to 
offset bad publicity on race relations

prime minister margaret thatcher today praised 
greater freedom of expression in the soviet union and defended her 
ban on broadcast interviews with members of the irish republican 
army 
opening a 35nation conference on improving the exchange of 
information between the east and west mrs thatcher also 
reiterated that britain will not bow to moslem demands to ban 
salman rusdies novel the satanic verses many moslems consider 
the book blasphemous 
mrs thatcher said the novel broke none of our laws 
there must never be an area where the government has 
discretion to censor it must always act within the law she 
said 
the meeting of government officials journalists and other 
delegates from eastern and western europe the united states and 
canada follows an eastwest conference on security and cooperation 
in europe held in january 
the vienna conference ended with participants committing to 
facilitate news reporting and improve working conditions for 
journalists the london meeting is aimed partly at assessing 
whether countries have lived up to their promises 
western nations are expected to use the monthlong conference 
known as the information forum to test the scope of soviet 
glasnost or openness 
mrs thatcher said major changes in the soviet union and east 
bloc countries now allow greater freedom to express views and 
opinions that are not necessarily those of governments and ruling 
parties 
but she said there was still distance to go 
there will only be a common european home if the occupants can 
mingle and talk freely mrs thatcher said referring to soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachevs comment that the west should view the 
soviets as part of europe 
there was speculation that eastern bloc countries will react to 
western prodding on freedom of expression and human rights with 
jibes that mrs thatcher has curbed the media 
as well as the ira ban imposed last year critics point to her 
attempts to ban the publication of spycatcher the memoirs of a 
retired intelligence agent and to what they regard as inadequate 
proposals for the reform of britains secrecy laws 
i make no apology for measures taken to prevent men of 
violence using television and radio to spread fear and create an 
illusion of authority mrs thatcher said terrorists have no 
respect for freedom they exploit freedom only to undermine it 
she said

the principals union has gone to court to 
challenge a reform plan that would strip them of tenure and give 
parents more of a say over schools 
principals should be the chief executive officer of their 
schools rather than a political person that works at the whim of 
the council said bruce berndt president of the chicago 
principals association 
tenure we feel is a necessary component for principals to 
take them out of the political arena 
the association which represents 450 of the districts 505 
principals some of whom work at more than one school filed suit 
monday in state court 
the lawsuit questions the constitutionality of the election 
process for parentcontrolled local school councils at each of 
chicagos 595 public schools and challenges a provision that strips 
principals of tenure 
donald moore executive director of designs for change an 
education advocacy agency that helped write the law said that if 
successful the lawsuit would cut the heart out of school reform in 
the 410000student system 
we always felt that two of the most vital elements of the bill 
were to give parents a majority voice in the education of their 
children and to eliminate principal tenure so that principals could 
be held accountable for their performance said moore 
under the reform law to take effect next month parentmajority 
councils would be elected by midoctober at each school 
parents would elect parents teachers would choose teachers and 
the community would elect its representatives a process the 
lawsuit called unconstitutional 
the councils to be composed of six parents two community 
leaders and a principal would evaluate principals and recommend 
dismissing unsatisfactory ones 
under the law principals also would be placed on fouryear 
performance contracts

mexican police say they believe the 
witch of a murderous cult of drug smugglers has been killed on 
orders from the groups leader but a texas sheriff says he 
suspects a ruse by the two fugitives 
us and mexican authorities have sought sara villareal aldrete 
a 24yearold student at a texas college living in mexico since 
the first of 15 victims of the cult were unearthed at a ranch south 
of the us border last week 
she was at first believed to be accompanying the reputed 
padrino or godfather of the cult adolfo de jesus constanzo 
26 but the houston chronicle and houston post reported that police 
believe he may have ordered her death 
she may have known too much she may have been ordered killed 
maybe by the padrino we believe she could have been killed and 
buried in mexico city juan benitez ayala commander of the 
federal judicial police in matamoros told the chronicle 
mexican police believe constanzo and two companions flew from 
mcallen to mexico city on april 10 and then to miami the next day 
the day 12 mutilated bodies were found on a ranch 20 miles west of 
matamoros said benitez 
cameron county sheriff alex perez based in this border city 
said he believes ms aldrete is alive even though mexican 
officials reported finding her purse her passport and 15000 in a 
mexico city apartment 
it just might be a puton perez said if they did find a 
purse or found the passport that may have been just a trick by 
sara and constanzo to appear she is dead all these crooks work 
that way to me she is still alive 
us authorities have arrested one man and issued warrants for 
two others in the growing international investigation mexican 
authorities earlier arrested four people 
investigators believe the drug smugglers committed grisly human 
sacrifices to protect themselves from the law 
serafin hernandez rivera of brownsville was arrested monday in 
houston on charges of marijuana importation possession and 
conspiracy he belongs to a family suspected of involvement in drug 
trafficking for at least 12 years said oran neck chief customs 
agent in brownsville 
neck said warrants also were issued for martin quintana and 
malio fabio two mexican citizens believed to have participated in 
the sacrificial slaying and mutilation of university of texas 
student mark kilroy who disappeared while vacationing along the 
border during spring break 
the two were among six suspects who remained at large and were 
considered dangerous neck said 
hernandez is the fifth suspect to be arrested his father 
brigido hernandez owns the northern mexico ranch where human 
sacrifice was practiced by the cult in the belief it would bring 
magical protection to the groups illicit business authorities 
said the father is not accused 
serafin hernandezs son serafin hernandez garcia jr and 
brother elio hernandez rivera are among the four suspects in 
custody in matamoros across the border from brownsville formal 
mexican charges were expected to be filed against them today 
saul hernandez rivera brother of hernandez sr and elio 
hernandez was machinegunned to death last year in mexico in a 
drugrelated execution neck said 
authorities have identified constanzos two companions as 
quintana and alvaro de leon valdez 
a person who answered the telephone at the mexican police office 
in matamoros early today said benitez was not available and there 
wasnt anyone else who could comment on the case calls to the 
customs office in brownsville late monday werent returned 
the filing of mexican charges against the four men in custody 
was delayed by the discovery on sunday of two bodies on a 
collective farm two miles south of the santa elena ranch 
the two victims were identified as moises castillo 52 of 
houston and hector de la fuente 39 of ejido san francisco west 
of matamoros both of whom had been missing since may they did not 
appear to have been tortured or mutiliated like other victims 
authorities said 
jose piedad silva arroyo mexicos chief federal narcotics 
investigator for northeastern tamaulipas state said authorities 
were considering adding the two victims deaths to the murder 
kidnapping drug and weapons charges pending against the four 
suspects 
officials said the two victims were drug dealers somehow 
involved with the cult and neck said the men were executed in a 
drug deal that went bad relatives of the two men denied they had 
any connection with drug trafficking

palestinian woman in the occupied west bank claiming she 
collaborated with israel arab reports said fifteen palestinians 
were reported wounded in clashes with soldiers 
the west bank and the occupied gaza strip were virtually shut 
down by a general strike called to protest the armys alleged use 
of confiscated arabowned cars to make surprise raids on 
palestinian villages 
the israeli newspapers maariv and alhamishmar reported the army 
was investigating slogans found on walls in the gaza strip in 
recent days calling on arabs to gather firearms for renewed 
revolt against israel 
arab reporters said the graffiti called only for keeping up the 
armed struggle a standard slogan of the 16month palestinian 
uprising the palestinians main weapons have been stones and 
firebombs and the use of guns would mean greater violence 
the wounding of 15 palestinians today came during at least four 
separate clashes between israeli troops and stonethrowing 
protesters in the gaza strip arab reports said the army said it 
was checking the reports 
a 14yearold arab boy also was wounded just outside jerusalem 
when an israeli truck driver fired on stonethrowing youths israel

driver after the vehicle was stoned in al azariye village or 
biblical bethany

with israel 
the army today denied that soldiers had killed one of the 
victims a 13yearold girl from dheishe refugee camp which was 
the scene of one of mondays worst clashes 
a complete investigation has shown that there is no connection 
between any army action and the girls death the army 
spokeswoman said 
the spokeswoman who is not identified under military 
regulations refused to elaborate on other possible causes of the 
girls death and said the girls family took her body for burial 
the army also said the circumstances were unclear in the gaza 
city deaths and in the stabbing death this morning of a 43yearold 
woman in the west bank city of nablus 
nadira boulus reportedly was stabbed by four attackers masked 
with arab headdresses who broke into her home arab reports said

a senate committee today approved a new 
attempt to write into law a fairness doctrine that would require 
broadcasters to air opposing sides of controversial issues 
the senate commerce science and transportation committee on a 
voice vote sent the measure on to the full senate a companion 
measure is awaiting floor action in the house 
sen larry pressler rsd voted against the bill and 
committee chairman ernest f hollings dsc noted that sen bob 
packwood rore also opposed the bill although he was not 
present for todays vote 
critics such as packwood contend that the fairness doctrine 
which was promulgated in the 1940s on the principle that radio and 
television spectrum was scare is outdated is this era of cable tv 
satellites and video cassette recorders 
broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a chilling effect on 
discussions of controversial issues and is an unconstitutional 
infringement on their first amendment rights 
but the bills primary sponsor sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
said the need for such legislation is greater than ever he said 
there is evidence broadcasters have been devoting less time to 
controversial issues since the federal communications commission 
repealed its fairness doctrine in 1987 
a virtually identical measure passed congress in 1987 but was 
vetoed by thenpresident reagan who said it violated the first 
amendment 
the justice department told rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee that it was 
recommending that president bush veto the new bill if it passes 
congress

the supreme court in a major victory for 
consumers today upheld state laws that allow those indirectly 
affected by illegal pricefixing to sue for monetary damages 
by a 70 votethe court reinstated efforts by four states 
california minnesota alabama and arizona to participate in a 
multimilliondollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix 
cement prices 
lower courts had relied on a 1977 supreme court decision in 
which the justices said federal antitrust law does not permit 
indirect purchasers to sue 
but writing for the court today justice byron r white said the 
1977 ruling was never intended to preclude state laws allowing such 
lawsuits 
it is one thing to consider the congressional policies 
identified in the 1977 decision in defining what sort of recovery 
federal antitrust law authorizes white said it is something 
altogether different and in our view inappropriate to consider 
them as defining what federal law allows states to do under their 
own antitrust law 
under the 1977 ruling if a manufacturer illegally conspires to 
fix a products price and sells it to a retailer the retailer may 
sue for triple damages but if the retailer passes on the illegally 
inflated price when selling the product to the ultimate consumer 
the consumer may not use federal antitrust law to sue 
todays decision however allows such consumers to sue under a 
state antitrust law 
justice department lawyers who sided with the appeal filed by 
the four states in the cement pricefixing case told the court 
that at least 11 other states and the district of columbia have 
enacted laws expressly giving indirect purchasers the right to sue 
the states are colorado hawaii illinois kansas maryland 
michigan mississippi new mexico rhode island south dakota and 
wisconsin 
in the case decided today the four states sought to sue in 
behalf of county and municipal governments that had purchased 
cement or products containing cement 
a spate of lawsuits was filed against cement manufacturers in 
1976 and 1977 alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices each 
of the four states involved in todays court action filed a suit 
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers 
the litigation was consolidated in federal court in arizona and 
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay 32 million to 
settle the case 
direct purchasers then challenged the states right to be 
compensated for indirect purchases 
a federal trial judge later upheld by the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals threw out the states suits todays decision 
reinstated them saying the lower courts wrongly concluded that the 
state laws unduly interfere with federal law 
white said allowing enforcement of state antitrust laws 
protecting indirect purchasers does not impair the effectiveness of 
federal antitrust law 
justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor did not 
participate in the case for unannounced reasons 
in other action the court 
expanded airlines protection against big damages limiting 
the financial penalties that may be imposed against korean air 
lines for a 1983 disaster in which 269 people died when a kal 
passenger jet was shot down over soviet airspace 
by a 90 vote the justices said the airline will not have to 
pay more than 75000 in damages for each person who died in the 
disaster 
backed out of deciding the validity of a 1987 attempt by 
congress to limit the presidents authority to withhold classified 
information from it 
in an unsigned opinion the justices sent the case back to a 
federal trial judge for further study 
ruled unanimously that states may prosecute employers for 
withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired workers 
the court in a case from massachusetts said the federal 
employee retirement income security act erisa does not preempt 
criminal prosecution in such cases 
the antitrust case is california vs arc america corp 871862

the supreme court today backed out of deciding 
the validity of a 1987 attempt by congress to limit the presidents 
authority to withhold classified information from it 
in an unsigned opinion the justices sent the case back to a 
federal trial judge for further study 
the high court cited several changed circumstances including 
the possibility that the dispute may have become moot 
at issue was a national security directive adopted by president 
ronald reagan in 1983 requiring federal officials before they are 
allowed access to classified documents to sign an agreement that 
they will never disclose the information 
the directive also established a standard form for officials to 
sign promising they never will divulge classified or 
classifiable information without written permission from proper 
executivebranch authorities 
federal employee unions and some members of congress bridled at 
the directive particularly the use of the word classifiable 
they said the presidential order restricted freespeech rights 
of federal employees and allows afterthefact classification of 
information in order to punish whistleblowers for making 
disclosures that embarrass their superiors 
members of congress said the directive would bar those federal 
employees who sign from revealing information to congress that it 
is entitled to receive 
congress then enacted a spending bill aimed at blocking the 
executive branch from withholding classifiable information or from 
impeding congressional access to such material 
us district judge oliver gasch struck down the legislation 
last year as unconstitutional 
the american foreign service association representing members 
of the nations diplomatic corps joined with senators and house 
members from both political parties in appealing directly to the 
supreme court 
but the cout today sent the case back to gasch noting that the 
term classifiable has been given a new narrower interpretation 
by executivebranch officials 
the case is american foreign service association vs garfinkel

solidarity leader lech walesa and 
communist party chief wojciech jaruzelski met today for the first 
time in more than seven years a day after the trade union was 
legalized 
i feel satisfaction we have come a very difficult and long 
way gen jaruzelski told reporters after the meeting 
he said that reconciliation is a process not an act and 
cited the broad agreement on political and economic reform reached 
between communist authorities and the opposition 
today we only put another seal in a way on that accord he 
said 
walesa left the meeting without talking to reporters 
walesa and jaruzelski began the meeting with a handshake inside 
a reception room of the parliament building near downtown warsaw 
said an official photographer who was present at the meeting he 
requested anonymity 
the two men then sat on a sofa and had a long conversation 
during the first part of the onehour reception reported 
solidarity activist zbigniew bujak who was among the approximately 
30 people present 
the deliberately lowprofile meeting was requested by the 
government according to an opposition source who demanded 
anonymity 
jaruzelski issued the martial law decree of dec 13 1981 that 
resulted in the imprisonment of walesa and thousands of other 
solidarity activists and the outlawing of the east blocs first 
independent trade union 
but now jaruzelski has led his reluctant party to reinstate 
solidarity which he hopes will help pull poland out of its 
economic crisis 
a new chapter is starting in the history of poland and it 
seems that both of the politicians are characterized with a great 
sense of timing and a capacity to respond to the challenges of the 
time said deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski 
walesa and jaruzelski last met nov 4 1981 about a month 
before jaruzelski imposed martial law and had walesa jailed 
walesa attended todays meeting as a member of the arbitration 
commission which was appointed to oversee implementation of the 
economic and political accords between the solidarityled 
opposition and the government 
the commission included 13 opposition delegates many of whom 
also had been jailed at jaruzelskis order in addition to 
jaruzelski and prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski the leaders 
of polands two communistallied political parties also were 
present at the meeting 
solidarity was officially legalized monday by threejudge panel 
in a warsaw provincial court in the same room where the union had 
its original charter approved in november 1980 
solidarity was suppressed after 16 months with the imposition of 
martial law the union movement was outlawed the following year 
party and government officials admit that by legalizing 
solidarity they hope to encourage the west to provide economic help 
to poland which is burdened by a 39 billion foreign debt 
in the april 5 accords the government also agreed to create the 
first freely elected legislative chamber a senate that would have 
veto power over the existing unicameral parliament the sejm 
on monday walesa had breakfast with foreign minister roland 
dumas of france and said poland must focus on solving its economic 
crisis now that his union is legal 
we have achieved half a victory for the moment now its a 
question of seeing if we can take advantage of all the 
possiblities walesa told dumas 
walesa praised president bush on monday for announcing an aid 
package for polands economy bush is a great man and he knows 
the polish situation very well he said 
walesa on monday also attended a meeting of an opposition 
committee supervising selection of independent candidates for the 
june parliamentary elections which will be the first in poland 
open to the opposition since 1947 
the 1947 voting which allowed communists to take unchallenged 
power was criticized in the west as tainted this years voting is 
planned to remove the partys full monopoly on power but still 
leaves it in a dominant position 
solidarity members who predict the union will grow to 5 million 
to 7 million members immediately face the twin tasks of organizing 
the union and the election campaign

states may prosecute employers for withholding 
accrued vacation pay owed fired workers the supreme court ruled 
unanimously today in a case from massachusetts 
the court said the federal employee retirement income security 
act erisa does not preempt criminal prosecution in such cases 
erisa covers employee welfare benefit plans but accrued 
vacation pay is more akin to a workers salary the court said 
except for the fact that the vacation payment has been 
deferred such payments are as much a part of the employees 
regular basic compensation as overtime pay or the payment of salary 
while the employee is absent on vacation said justice john paul 
stevens for the court 
the ruling leaves massachusetts officials free to prosecute 
richard morash president of the yankee bank for finance and 
savings 
the yankee companies inc in may 1984 acquired the financially 
troubled home savings bank 
a year later two vice presidents christopher winslow and 
william tuttle were fired winslow said the bank owed him 14520 
for 66 unused vacation days and tuttle said he was owed 11146 for 
42 unused vacation days 
state prosecutors filed criminal charges against morash after he 
refused to pay the money except for the vacation days the vice 
presidents were owed for the few months they worked in 1985 before 
their firings 
morash was accused of violating a state law that applies 
specifically to employers accused of not paying wages to workers 
including vacation benefits 
the massachusetts supreme court ruled the law was preempted by 
erisa because the vacation pay was part of the banks employee 
benefit plan states are barred by erisa from using criminal laws 
to enforce such plans the state court said 
law enforcement officials from 12 states joined massachusetts in 
urging the us supreme court to overturn the state court ruling 
the states are connecticut florida illinois maine minnesota 
new hampshire new york north carolina oklahoma vermont 
wisconsin and wyoming 
the states said federal law and enforcement mechanisms are 
inadequate to protect workers wrongfully denied vacation pay 
stevens said today that criminal prosecution is permitted in the 
case of vacation payments owed by a single employer the situation 
would be different if a separate fund was created by a group of 
employers to guarantee vacation benefits to laborers who regularly 
shift jobs from one employer to another he said 
the case is massachusetts vs morash 8832

urgent repairs were recommended 
twice since 1985 but never carried out on a bridge that collapsed 
over the weekend killing a teenager and injuring two others 
inspection records show 
the bridge was listed in critical condition after 
inspections in 1985 and 1987 meaning it should be closed until 
the indicated repair is completed 
state inspectors had found rotting guardrails and soil erosion 
and the records show that no repairs were made the inspectors also 
noted that a fire apparently had been set on some of the bridges 
wood a few years ago 
the three victims from the saturday night accident were riding 
in a pickup truck that plunged 30 feet onto railroad tracks below 
local officials said the truck may have driven off the span 
knocked out a support on the way down and caused the bridge to 
collapse 
the state had no authority to enforce repairs on the span 
because until last year it was owned by csx transportation said 
gwen hopkins spokeswoman for the state transportation department 
csx sold the bridge to anderson county last year said lloyd lewis 
a company spokesman in jacksonville fla 
asked why the railroad had not addressed the problems cited in 
the inspections lewis responded whatever did not happen three 
years ago doesnt matter were not responsible anymore 
the county applied earlier for money to replace the structure 
said county attorney david stuart there was no doubt that it was 
time to be replaced he said 
glen smith 44 said his brother died in 1981 when his car hit 
the bridge rail and went over the side the accident led to a 
petition drive to build a new bridge he said 
saturdays accident was the second involving a tennessee bridge 
failure in two weeks inspection reports on both structures warned 
earlier of problems 
eight people died april 1 in the collapse of a bridge over the 
hatchie river 45 miles north of memphis investigators said flood 
waters had weakened the supports of that bridge

house speaker jim wright today took his 
defense against ethics charges to the most important jury of all 
the 260 house democrats who reelected him speaker just four months 
ago and who will have the final say over whether he keeps that 
post 
i told them i intend to fight and i intend to win wright 
dtexas told reporters after addressing a closeddoor session of 
the democratic caucus in the house chamber he received a standing 
ovation at the end of the 30minute speech 
as lawmakers left they described wrights defense as detailed 
and specific but they appeared agonized over the decision that 
faces them in the coming weeks 
the easy thing for democrats to do is to throw jim wright over 
the side and instantly install house majority leader tom foley 
behind the wheel said rep pat williams dmont it may be 
that the toughest political vote of our lives will be the one to 
save him 
democratic whip tony coelho dcalif predicted wright will be 
able to knock down many of the 69 charges against him and will 
remain speaker the main thing is for the american people to 
understand that these are mere accusations he said 
filing of the charges on monday made wright the first speaker in 
us history to be formally charged with ethical wrongdoing by the 
house although some of his predecessors have been tainted by 
scandals 
the voluminous report of the ethics committee included new 
details about how he sold thousands of copies of his book 
reflections of a public man to specialinterest groups 
several colleagues called those deals the most troubling of the 
charges against the texas democrat 
in one case a march 1986 speech to the fertilizer institute 
the trade group planned to give wright a plaque or a small gift in 
return for his appearance but wrights office arranged instead for 
the group to buy 2023 worth of books yielding the congressman 
1112 in royalty income 
house members are limited by the rules to accepting no more than 
30 percent of their salaries in outside speaking fees the house 
ethics panel found reason to believe that wright circumvented that 
limit by converting speech honoraria into book royalties which are 
exempt from the limits 
in two other cases a speech to the ocean spray cranberry 
organization in the fall of 1985 and a speech in march 1986 to the 
midcontinent oil amp gas association wright sold books instead of 
collecting speaking fees and was given the books to distribute as 
he saw fit the ethics committee saw those as unreported gifts to 
the speaker 
my view is that count one dealing with the book sales is the 
most serious issue said rep steny hoyer dmd vice chairman 
of the house democratic caucus the organization of all 261 house 
democrats 
its a bad day it looks rotten but at some point in time 
the facts do make a difference and will help the speaker he said 
the speakers problems were the no 1 topic of conversation on 
the house floor but lawmakers were reacting cautiously in public 
to mondays formal filing of charges against wright the equivalent 
of an indictment 
i think we have a responsibility to keep our minds open and 
our mouths shut until we have an opportunity to read the report 
said rep david obey dwis who wrote many of the rules wright is 
charged with violating 
we learned that the charges are not trivial they are not 
technical and they are not aimed at his wife as wright had 
argued last week said rep vin weber rminn a close ally of 
georgia republican rep newt gingrich whose complaint last may 
launched the wright investigation 
republicans were going out of their way not to lambaste wright 
fearing that to do so would only make it easier for the speaker to 
rally democrats against what he has portrayed as a partisan 
vendetta instead republicans simply pointed to the ethics panels 
unanimous bipartisan vote to issue the formal statement of charges 
against wright 
democrats pinned their hopes on rebutting what they saw as the 
weakest part of the ethics committees case the charge that wright 
improperly accepted some 145000 in gifts from fort worth 
developer george mallick because mallick had a direct interest in 
legislation before congress 
the rules bar acceptance of more than 100 in any calendar year 
from a person deemed to have a direct interest in congressional 
action 
the panel in its report said mallicks large oil and gas and 
real estate investments set him apart from the general public and 
made it reasonable to infer that he would be interested in 
lawmaking on taxes and real estate development in addition he had 
dealings with savings and loan institutions and with a fort worth 
redevelopment project that were affected by bills before congress 
the committee said 
less easy to dismiss were the counts relating to the book sales 
the most damaging thing in the report and that doesnt mean 
its convictable is the book business said rep charles 
wilson dtexas a wright defender 
other democrats were pointing to the counts against wright that 
had been dismissed charges that involved misuse of his public 
office and public funds and were minimizing the ones that remain 
observed one wright defender rep jack brooks dtexas you 
would have thought that he had shot four nuns in the church 
the panel said it was still investigating the unusually high 
purchase offer made by a company for mallightcos interest in an 
oil and gas well as wrights blind trust was selling its interest 
in the company he coowned with mallick wrights interest was sold 
june 9 at the same time the ethics investigation was opened and 
the high offer raised the value of the shares

time magazine says it will vigorously fight a 
libel suit filed by greek premier andreas papandreou over an 
article reporting an accusation he stole millions of dollars from a 
bank 
the lawsuit was filed in london and announced here monday by 
papandreou attorney leonard boudin who said the premier is seeking 
asyet unspecified damages 
the lawsuit cites the cover story in times international 
edition march 13 a similar article in the us edition was not on 
the cover 
the articles quoted former greek bank president george koskotas 
who is jailed in massachusetts as saying he passed millions from 
the bank of crete to papandreou and other figures in the premiers 
socialist government 
papandreou premier since 1981 has denied the accusation 
boudin said that in using koskotas time was relying on a man 
whose character and reputation for truth is questioned by time 
itself in the article 
time said that it tried repeatedly to get papandreous response 
and that it noted in the article earlier denials made by the prime 
minister 
time magazine will take whatever steps are necessary to fight 
the allegations of this lawsuit and defend its right to report 
news the magazine said in a statement 
boudin said the lawsuit was filed in england because the story 
was more damaging abroad and because it is easier for a public 
figure to make a case under english libel law than under american 
since last fall allegations of financial wrongdoing at the bank 
of crete have rocked the papandreou government which is up for 
reelection in june 
the scandal and the 70year premiers open affair with a 
34yearold former airline stewardess have hurt him with voters

a muddy field beside a hillside in rural 
vermont seems an unlikely place to debate drug testing for high 
school athletes 
but the 28 members of the woodstock union high school lacrosse 
team running their drills there at have come under more scrutiny 
than theyve ever faced before because of a drug testing program 
proposed by coach charles gibbs jr 
its the first of its kind in vermont and has prompted debate 
throughout the state 
its just one little coachs attempt in one little area to 
help kids say no gibbs said 
the program is completely voluntary and his players think fewer 
than half of the squad will sign up the program probably wont 
begin for at least another week 
i think it will work but i dont have to prove to anyone i 
dont do drugs said player eli kent whos decided not to 
participate 
everyone who volunteers gibbs included will put their names in 
a hat two names will be chosen every monday and those players will 
submit to urinalysis 
a player will be suspended for two weeks if the test comes back 
positive a subsequent offense will result in a oneyear suspension 
gibbs believes the plan will help students resist peer pressure 
to try alcohol and drugs 
but not everyone looks at it that way 
to me it smacks of 1984 even though its five years late 
said school board member robert odonnell referring to the george 
orwell novel in which government looks over peoples shoulders to 
maintain a strictly controlled society 
odonnell the only member of the school board to vote against 
the plan said he believes it encourages students to try to beat 
the system rather than helping them make decisions for the future 
we need to empower them to make the right decision not to set 
up a penal measure he said 
odonnell said athletes already are asked to sign a statement 
saying they wont use drugs or alcohol he also said the school has 
a counseling program to help teenagers deal with drug abuse 
whats more students and school officials dont feel drug 
problems in woodstock are any worse and in fact may be less 
severe than in many other towns 
from what ive seen there arent any really heavy drugs at 
all said donald caffrey a junior and member of the lacrosse 
team he does not plan to participate in the testing program 
its not the first time such a program has been suggested a 
school board plan in lafayette ind to randomly test high school 
athletes and cheerleaders for drug use was upheld by a federal 
appeals court and could be implemented this fall the american 
civil liberties union is considering appealing the case to the us 
supreme court 
gibbs defended the legality of his plan in a written proposal to 
the school board 
first it is voluntary and only voluntary second there is no 
criminal penalty which attaches to testing positive he said 
adding that he didnt think it was much different from a curfew for 
team members 
the vermont chapter of the aclu does not plan to challenge the 
program because no one has filed a complaint but executive 
director leslie williams isnt keen on the idea 
it seems to me that the intentions are good here she said 
but theyre not thinking through they say that its a voluntary 
program but we all know what its like in high school its going 
to be pretty hard to say no to the program 
williams said the tests amounted to a bodily search without 
probable cause 
gibbs believes the proposal has prompted the community to assess 
its social situation and examine the example it is setting for its 
youth but he stressed that the plan is an experiment 
i think its worth it for this season to try it to see if it 
does any good gibbs said but if i find its dividing my 
team between those who sign up and those who dont its gone

andrew lloyd webbers new musical aspects of 
love received mixed reviews today following weeks of speculation 
in the british press that the tony awardwinning composer was 
losing his midas touch 
the show is his first musical since the broadway smash hit the 
phantom of the opera which swept the tony awards last season 
the new show made up of songs without spoken dialogue signals a 
newfound emphasis on emotion over spectacle from the man who 
brought felines and trains to melodic life in cats and 
starlight express 
charles osborne in the daily telegraph said the show which 
opened monday at the prince of wales theater was certainly 
andrew lloyd webbers best so far 
however milton shulman in the standard found the show a 
mannered rather precious operetta singularly lacking in real 
passion 
at a cost of 34 million the production sold advance tickets 
worth 85 million it is sold out through 1989 
the musical set in france and based on a 1955 novel by david 
garnett relates the tangled romantic intrigue among three 
generations of a family and their entourage their aspects of 
love include romance between cousins and lesbianism 
the blacktie opening came five days after the shows originally 
scheduled debut 
the premiere was delayed by problems with scenery and length in 
addition james bond actor roger moore who was to play aging 
dilettante george dillingham left the show during rehearsals 
moore said he felt he was not up to singing the part 
the show marks director trevor nunns first musical since his 
production of chess bombed on broadway last year 
jack tinker in the daily mail applauded lloyd webbers daring 
this is uncharted territory on so many fronts he wrote but he 
added that he wondered whether the public are prepared for such a 
show of courage or not 
michael billington in the guardian praised the show for 
exploring the human heart rather than the possibilities of 
hightech scenery but he called it a beguiling fitfully 
pleasing musical rather than a perfect one 
irving wardle in the times called it a wellcrafted show 
but he faulted the music as timid and uninteresting 
the cast includes kevin colson who inherited moores role as 
the wealthy painter george and michael ball as his nephew alex 
both men are romantically linked to a french actress rose 
performed by american ann crumb 
kathleen rowe mcallen another american plays georges italian 
mistress giulietta diana morrison is georges young daughter 
jenny who becomes ensnared by the dangerous liaisons around her 
the shows most heavily plugged song love changes 
everything has received extensive airplay on british radio it 
is sung by ball who is being hyped as the london theaters new 
teen hearthrob 
aspects of love helps resuscitate a genre the english 
musical which received a double blow last year with the 
backtoback broadway failures of chess and carrie

the leader of czechoslovakias communist party 
said tuesday there will be no rehabiliation of alexander dubcek 
who led the 1968 prague spring liberalization campaign that was 
crushed by soviet tanks 
we dont intend any political rehabiliation or return of 
alexander dubcek to political activity czechoslovak leader milos 
jakes told reporters no one would accept that except for a few 
people 
the return of dubcek might be misunderstood and could lead to 
instability he said 
jakes held a news conference after meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev on a working visit to the soviet union 
the czechoslovak communist party lags behind parties in hungary 
and poland in adopting reforms modeled on gorbachevs restructuring 
campaign but jakes said it was reforming at its own pace 
czechoslovakia is not a conservative force on the map of the 
world he said 
we have similar tasks to the soviet communist party certainly 
we take into account our internal conditions in czechoslovakia when 
we determine the rate and scope of change he said we also 
take into account the experience of the soviet union this is very 
important to us 
parts of gorbachevs reform effort are similar to changes 
initiated by dubcek in 1968 but the czechoslovak leadership 
installed after dubcek was ousted in april 1969 has resisted 
political change 
a series of protests demanding political and economic reforms 
rocked the czechoslovak capital of prague this year in a 
muchpublicized trial dissident playright vaclav havel was 
convicted of incitement and obstructing police and sentenced to 
jail 
dubcek was allowed to travel to italy in november his first 
trip abroad in 18 years but in march he was denied permission to 
attend the congress of the italian communist party 
the czechoslovak party newspaper rude pravo charged in march 
that recent interviews dubcek has given to western journalists were 
used to give a semblance of authenticity to slanders of the 
current leadership 
jakes said the czechoslovak party under dubcek set a correct 
course for reforming the countrys political and economic 
structure but it got out of control 
the leadership of that time was not able to guide the country 
along the right road jakes said we witnesses the weakening of 
socialism and he violation of traditions that had existed since 
1948 the year communists took power 
dubcek today is a private citizen and he speaks his own 
mind jakes said 
noting that dubceks sons have professional careers and that the 
former czechoslovak leader is living on a pension jakes added i 
dont think he has grounds to complain 
jakes said the party was willing to give more power to smaller 
parties that are allied with it but does not plan to allow the 
creating of opposition parties as hungarian communists have 
pledged 
reforms in czechoslovakia as well as in the soviet union where 
a political opposition is not permitted must be carried out by the 
communist party he said if it is not headed by the party the 
process will not lead to strengthening of socialism jakes said

consumer prices jumped 05 percent in march 
propelled by higher costs for food energy and apparel and helped 
produce the largest quarterly increase in two years the government 
reported today 
last months climb in the labor departments consumer price 
index followed advances of 06 percent in january and 04 percent 
in february 
overall consumer prices in the past three months rose at a 
compound annual rate of 61 percent 
it was the largest quarterly increase since the first three 
months of 1987 when prices rose 63 percent on an annual basis 
and was significantly higher than the annual consumer price rises 
of 44 percent registered for each of the past two years 
price increases have been even steeper at the wholesale level 
where inflation ran at a compound annual rate of 102 percent in 
the januarymarch period the largest quarterly increase in eight 
years 
daniel t van dyke senior economist at bank of america in san 
francisco said in advance of todays report that while price rises 
have moderated some since the start of the year we still have a 
problem with the pace of inflation 
were in a period where the inflation rate seems to be hanging 
around 5 to 55 percent van dyke said that is too high for 
any longrun kind of equilibrium and i dont think thats what the 
federal reserve has in mind either 
food costs last month rose twice as much as they did during the 
previous month up 08 percent in march after advancing 04 percent 
in february 
energy costs meanwhile registered their sharpest increase 
since august 1987 last month advancing 11 percent after rising 
06 percent in february 
the boost in petroleumbased energy prices up at a 224 percent 
annual rate so far this year accounted for more than twofifths of 
the price acceleration during the first quarter the labor 
department said 
rising food prices were responsible for nearly onequarter of 
the price increases during the quarter it said 
excluding those two volatile categories other consumer prices 
rose 04 percent in march the same pace as in february 
the march figures left the overall consumer price index at 1223 
percent of its 198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods costing 100 during the base period would have cost 
12230 in march 70 cents more than in february 
the overall index unlike other figures in the report is not 
adjusted to remove the effect on prices of seasonal fluctuations 
president bush told a meeting of construction unions today that 
the key to continued economic health for the nation is to bring 
down inflation and interest rates by reducing the federal deficit 
we must keep inflation and interest rates down and the way 
to do that is to bring the budget deficit down he said 
the labor department offered these other details on price 
changes in march 
the increase in food prices was largely a reflection of a 24 
percent jump in prices for meats poultry fish and eggs 
apparel prices rose 14 percent last month after dropping 02 
percent in february the increase was blamed on the introduction of 
higherpriced spring and summer fashions particularly for women 
gasoline prices shot up 21 percent in march after advancing 
17 percent during february gasoline prices were up 48 percent 
for the first three months of 1989 
medical care costs rose 05 percent in march following 
increases of 08 percent in both january and february 
entertainment costs were up 03 percent last month with 
increased ticket prices for events such as movies concerts and 
sporting events accounting for most of the increase 
bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch amp co in new 
york said before todays report that the nation is in for a 
string of unpleasant inflation numbers for awhile 
he said that in addition to higher costs for food and energy 
rising prices for materials and wages are contributing to inflation 
the latest survey by blue chip economic indicators in sedona 
ariz which each month polls 50 of the nations leading 
forecasters found the consensus estimate for inflation this year 
had risen to 49 percent from earlier expectations it would reach 
47 percent 
the economists forecast an easing of inflation later in the 
year reflecting some expectations that a recession will arrive 
late in 1989 or early next year that would reduce price pressures 
the survey found 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates and tightening its grip on the money supply in an 
effort to restrain economic growth and keep inflation in check 
but analysts caution that it takes a long time for slower growth 
to translate into lower inflation and some fear that the fed will 
tighten credit so severely that its antiinflation campaign 
unintentionally pushes the country into a recession 
steinberg said that while the economy already is showing signs 
of cooling as the expansion stretches into a seventh year 
historically inflation tends to peak after the economy has prety 
much slowed down 
usually its after the start of a recession that inflation 
peaks steinberg said i think its going to be the same story 
this year 
van dyke however said the fed should be able to avoid a 
recession by quickly easing up on credit should the threat of an 
economic downturn emerge 
if the fed thought the economy was entering a recession i 
think it would move extremely rapidly to ease credit van dyke 
said i think that would have an impact

records of imperial russian consulates in the 
united states and canada in the late 19th and early 20th centuries 
which have been in us custody for 55 years will be turned over 
to the soviet union at a ceremony in moscow wednesday 
don w wilson archivist of the united states will deliver to 
soviet authorities the first boxes of the original files of the 
consulates the national archives announced tuesday 
the boxes contain such items as passport application forms of 
the tsarist period dated 1918 and containing a blank for social 
rank and a letter from count ilya tolstoy inquiring about his 
brother the novelist leo tolstoy 
the remainder of the more than 400 boxes will be returned to the 
soviet union in the course of the year the archival agency said 
the papers have all been microfilmed and the copies will be 
available to researchers here 
the documents created from about 1862 to 1922 are from files 
of soviet consulates in new york chicago san francisco honolulu 
philadelphia portland ore and seattle and in montreal and 
vancouver british columbia 
until 1933 the records were stored in the russian embassy in 
washington at that time the russian financial attache who was 
custodian of the records asked the us government to take 
custody they were moved to a warehouse under the auspices of the 
state department and were occasionally consulted by officials of 
the soviet embassy the announcement by the archives said 
in 1947 they were transferred to the national archives for 
safekeeping 
these records which document official government activity 
should properly be held for research use in the soviet union 
wilson said in a statement issued here for years the united

the latest education slogan from the bush 
administration is deregulation 
broached last week before a cheering audience in a union nj 
high school president bushs offer to reduce the red tape long 
associated with federal education programs was hailed as a step 
that would give school officials flexibility to better serve needy 
youngsters 
but at least a few worried that unless very carefully crafted 
deregulation might mean a return to the bad old days before the 
civil rights era when schools had no one looking over their 
shoulders to ensure that the poor the handicapped and other 
disadvantaged students got the education they were entitled to 
we want to waive some regulations for poorer communities 
allowing them to pool state and federal funds in exchange for 
higher accountability and performance bush said 
well give you the flexibility you show us the results he 
said 
bush didnt elaborate and us department of education 
officials said they had no further specifics to offer 
were still working on how to implement what the president 
said charles kolb deputy undersecretary of the us department 
of education said in an interview monday 
but the call for more federal flexibility was generally welcomed 
by educators who have long decried the paperwork of programs such 
as bilingual education vocational education migrant education 
education for the handicapped and chapter 1 which provides 
remedial programs for lowincome pupils 
clearing away needless regulations also squares neatly with 
current school reform efforts which stress more freedom for 
educators in exchange for better classroom results deregulation 
advocates point out that forcing educators to account for every 
federal nickel not only wastes time but may actually hurt children 
federal accounting rules make it difficult to serve certain 
children in regular classrooms youngsters getting remedial help 
under chapter 1 for example often find themselves separated from 
their peers for part of the school day because thats the only way 
to fulfill the requirement that such children are the sole 
recipients of the federal aid 
but school officials increasingly criticize such pullout 
programs because they tend to segregate stigmatize and label 
children with special needs 
these kids are not pulled out for any pedogogical purposes 
but only for accounting purposes said gordon ambach former new 
york state school superintendent who heads the washingtonbased 
council of chief state school officers 
i as a former chief and representing chiefs across the 
country would be pleased to see some deregulation efforts he 
said 
as a general proposal we like that agreed albert shanker 
president of the american federation of teachers some of the 
regulations have been too restrictive its meant having to pull 
kids out of classrooms to get special programs 
but others notably mary hatwood futrell president of the 
national education association believe the cheerleaders of 
deregulation may need to be reminded why congress put that red tape 
in education programs in the first place 
many of the biggest federal education programs were conceived 
during the 1960s civil rights era before that time some funds 
intended for poor or handicapped students disappeared into the 
general operating funds of school districts never reaching the 
students they were intended for 
i think we would have to look very carefuly at any effort to 
remove regulations futrell said a lot of people forget that 
the money used to be spent on equipment not for the students in 
those programs the regulations are there to make sure there are 
certain levels of quality 
such concerns indicate that while many educators may greet 
deregulation warmly in principle it could be tough to implement in 
practice 
the many groups representing migrants disabled and 
disadvantaged youngsters will certainly press bush and congress for 
assurances that deregulation wont mean that schools will no longer 
be held accountable for reaching the intended targets of federal 
programs

a university of utah scientist who claimed 
to have achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water says further 
experiments have yielded even more energy and run more efficiently 
chemistry professor stanley pons also said at a news conference 
monday that the claims he made last month with british colleague 
martin fleischmann had been partly verified by more than 60 
university and private laboratories 
fleischmann of the university of southampton said in a radio 
netherlands interview that he had not wanted to announce the 
process until next year but because of the importance of the work 
the scientists had to publish and be damned 
the two drew skepticism from experts when they announced march 
23 that an experiment using common lab equipment at room 
temperature had been run for more than 100 hours and had achieved 
nuclear fusion producing four times as much energy as it used 
pons said monday that a controlled fusion reaction has been 
sustained more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy 
water and a palladium electrode he said recent tests produced 
roughly eight times the energy consumed 
pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts 
of electricity from the experiment or about 67 watts per cubic 
centimeter of electrode that compares with 26 watts per cubic 
centimeter in the earlier experiments 
of the more than 60 other experimenters pons said none has 
reported observing both the production of neutrons and the high 
level of heat that he and fleischmann produced 
neutrons are a telltale sign of fusion the process powering 
the sun in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when 
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse 
scientists say that if fusion can be created as easily as pons 
and fleischmann claim it could be a relatively inexpensive and 
virtually inexhaustible energy source 
pons said most of the other researchers have chosen not to make 
their findings public and he would not identify them they said 
they either are going to publish or are holding off for legal 
reasons pons said 
pons said the next major step in his research will be to 
generate sufficient energy to perform some observable task 
fleischmann in the radio interview said he did not expect 
quick verification of the work done in utah 
i dont think a significant series of experiments can be done 
in under three to six months after people have started 
experiments he said

girl

of partial vision in that eye 
none of the 50 other people in the store was seriously hurt 
charles a petersen of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms said the bomb apparently was electrically fired it 
was a little more sophisticated than the average pipe bomb it took 
some knowledge to construct it he said 
police said they have no suspects and no motive in the bombing 
but were searching for two men seen leaving the store when the 
explosion occurred 
detective sgt mike kouns said the men did not appear to be 
concerned about the bombing unlike other customers investigators 
released composite sketches of two men based on descriptions from 
store employees kouns said 
kouns said that police would question k mart employees who have 
been fired recently but that there was no immediate reason to 
believe a former worker was involved 
the store received no warning before the explosion which 
occurred about an hour before closing said sheriff joseph g 
mcatee 
the store looks like everybody dropped whatever they were 
looking at said scott minier a sheriffs department spokesman 
theres blood on the tile the trash bag area is a mess there is 
a blood and merchandise scattered all over 
minier said the bomb had a pressuresensitive release 
it sounded like a pop said a clerk judy kiefer the 
first thing i heard was a child screaming a lot of people were 
saying get out of here 
the girls mother maurine bower 31 suffered a minor shrapnel 
injury to one of her legs and fainted she was treated at the 
hospital 
louis m profeta a medical student at indiana university was 
shopping when the bomb exploded 
i saw the little girl her clothes were on fire and the mother 
was screaming both father and mother were covered in blood 
profeta said we rendered first aid and got the father and mother 
away then got her stabilized 
the father kevin bower 31 was holding his youngest daughter 
megan 1 at the time of the explosion 
the severed portion of erins hand was packed in ice and taken 
to the hospital but officials said it could not be reattached 
she still has her thumb and about half of the palm of her 
hand said barbara mcgraw a hospital spokeswoman 
authorities brought in dogs to sniff out more explosives none 
was found 
other k mart stores in the indianapolis area planned to take 
precautions as a result of the bombing minier said 
agents of the us bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms are 
aiding the investigation

the proposed fsx fighter plane deal with japan 
will cost america jobs and might damage national security a 
representative of the aerospace workers union told congress on 
tuesday 
we know the deal does not serve our members interests does 
not serve the economic interests of their communities and we are 
unconvinced that it serves our national security interest said 
william holayter legislative director of the international 
assocation of machinists and aerospace workers 
holayter told the house banking subcommittee on economic 
stabilization that the proposed deal for japan to build its own 
version of the f16 fighter would jeopardize the jobs of 10000 
union members employed on production lines by general dynamics in 
fort worth texas 
the bush administration is reviewing a memorandum of 
understanding signed with japan in the final months of the reagan 
administration under which general dynamics based in st louis 
would develop with japans mitsubishi heavy industries an advanced 
version of the f16 for deployment in the 1990s 
critics say the deal is a 7 billion giveaway of us technology 
that will help japan develop its own aircraft manufacturing 
capacity an industry in which the united states retains the lead 
however an independent analyst told the subcommittee that the 
fsx deal would benefit the united states as much as it would japan 
i cannot see how the fsx project with its specialized fighter 
engine will provide japan with some technology to break through 
the commercial jet engine market technology they do not already 
possess in a form more germane to the commercial market said 
george berke a former fighter pilot who now works as a defense 
analyst and consultant in washington 
japan has been assembling and manufacturing components for 
advanced us aircraft since the korean war in the early 1950s 
said berke and that has not caused the united states to lose 
either jobs or its lead in the field 
more jobs will be lost if we rebuff the japanese than we can 
hope to gain by insisting on an offtheshelf buy he said 
william r hawkins an analyst for the us business and 
industrial council and william g phillips president of the 
national council for industrial defense a lobbying group opposed 
the proposed deal 
hawkins urged japan to buy usmade f15 or f18 fighters to 
replace its own aging fleet of f1 fighters and said tokyo sought 
the fsx deal because it wants to expand its aerospace industry 
and bring its technological capabilities up to the first rank 
phillips whose group has campaigned against what he called the 
erosion of americas industrial base applauded president bush 
for his willingness to carefully review the intricate details of 
the deal and his insistence on changes in the basic documents

university of new hampshire fraternity house after two members were 
arrested for selling cocaine but school officials opposed the 
action according to a report published today 
kappa sigmas president and a fraternity brother were charged in 
1988 with selling cocaine to undercover police inside the house 
and police favored seizing it under federal drug laws the union 
leader of manchester reported 
durham police presented the case to the us attorneys 
office and we were eager to adopt the case we believed it was 
meritorious and had decided to do it provided we got the 
cooperation of the university assistant us attorney david 
vicinanzo told the union leader 
the newspaper said vicinanzo refused to discuss a meeting he had 
with university officials he said only we didnt do the 
forfeiture 
vicinanzo did not immediately return a phone call this morning 
gregg sanborn dean of student affairs told the newspaper 
given the specific information relating to this case we did not 
feel the house was subject to forfeiture 
federal drug forfeiture laws allow prosecutors to seize homes 
cars boats and other property used for drug trafficking 
both fraternity members pleaded guilty to drug charges one 
served 80 days in jail the other was sentenced to a year the 
newspaper said 
sanborn said both students withdrew from the university and 
would be subject to university discipline if they sought

told the committee 
richards who said he spoke for nato commander gen john galvin

take any cuts then modernization and force structure are both 
areas we must go to before we look to readiness of the forces 
president bush and congressional budget negotiators announced 
last friday an agreement to cut 10 billion from the fiscal 1990 
defense budget instead of the previously expected 63 billion 
thenpresident reagan had proposed a budget authority of 3056 
billion for fiscal 1990 which opens oct 1 but bush and 
congressional officials agreed on authority of 2956 billion 
in his testimony powell emphasized that the pentagon needs some 
indication of the type of defense the nation envisions 
the one thing the defense department needs more than anything 
else is a clear sign what the american people and congress will 
support in the future the general said whats killing us is 
the lack of stability

president robert mugabe announced 
tuesday a marketoriented investment code to attract domestic and 
foreign capital to this southern african nations flagging economy 
his longawaited announcement indicates mugabe is moving away 
from the marxistleninist principles he espoused when he led the 
whiteruled british colony of rhodesia to independence as 
blackgoverned zimbabwe on april 18 1980 
it won cheers from 40000 people celebrating the ninth 
independence anniversary at a rally where trumpet fanfares and 
military parades inherited from the colonial era competed with 
rhythmic traditional dances and tribal drums 
mugabe promised to relax state controls of prices and wages and 
make it easier for companies to send profits out of the country 
the lack of an investment code has scared away foreign 
speculators as the government juggled vows to nationalize with 
assurances that its word should be good enough for investors who 
demanded some kind of insurance 
as a result the biggest private foreign investments since 
independence are a bubblegum factory built by danes and a 
usfunded baked beans cannery 
nevertheless zimbabwe remains among black africas most 
prosperous nations 
mugabe said real economic growth has occurred but the pattern 
has been highly unsatisfactory and threatened to reduce living 
standards 
it is my governments conviction that the country should enter 
a new phase of sustained growth and development so that the economy 
responds more adequately to the challenges we face and aspirations 
of our people he said 
the government now recognizes the need for a more rational and 
marketorientated way to determine prices and incomes mugabe said 
in a sharp turn away from previous policies that is in line with 
reforms being attempted in other african states 
economists long have urged mugabe to introduce economic reforms 
to attract foreign capital at a time when 140000 students leave 
schools each year to compete for just 8000 jobs 
mugabe 65 made major social reforms in the country by 
introducing cheap schooling and free health care but zimbabwes 
agricultureoriented economy remains largely in the hands of 
100000 minority whites who favor free enterprise

the congressional joint economic committee 
responding to president bushs call for a new spirit of 
cooperation put aside nearly a decade of bickering between 
democrats and republicans and issued a bipartisan report tuesday on 
the state of the us economy 
rep lee hamilton dind the committee chairman hailed the 
consensus report the first the committee has been able to produce 
since 1980 as a breakthrough which would set the stage for 
congress and the administration to tackle such tough economic 
issues as the federal budget deficit 
during the reagan years the 20member committee of senators and 
house members became a battleground over reagan ecowith the panel so badly 
split that it was forced to issue two 
annual reports eanomic policies 
ch year one authored by democrats and the other 
by republicans 
however hamilton who took over as chairman of the panel this 
year pushed hard for a consensus report saying it was needed both 
for symbolism and substance to show that the two parties were 
willing to put aside the past decade of warfare in an effort to 
address the countrys economic ills 
this report provides a realistic accurate assessment of 
the strengths weaknesses and uncertains no 1 economic power but we 
are 
not without serious problems 
the report said that reducing the huge federal budget deficit 
was the most important economic priority facing congress and the 
administration but it did not provide any suggestions on how the 
gap between spending and revenues should be narrowed 
it also listed the need for improving the countrys education 
system as a top priority contending that failing to upgrade 
education could saddle americas economy with enormous longterm 
costs in an increasingly competitive global economy 
america is falling behind the rest of the world in promoting 
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money 
per student than any other country in the world the committee said 
the panel cited statistics showing that the country has an 
overall dropout rate of 25 percent with rates for blacks hitting 
40 percent and for hispanics exceeding 50 percent partly as a 
consequence 13 percent of 17yearold americans cannot read write 
or count the report said 
other economic problems cited in the report were the countrys 
low personal savings rate the emergence of america as the worlds 
largest debtor nation the third world debt crisis and the 
financial difficulties of the nations savings and loan 
associations 
in each of those areas as with the federal budget deficit the 
committee did not offer any specific solutions but hamilton said 
he was convinced that a consensus was beginning to emerge in 
washington on ways to solve the various problems 
sens william roth rdel and steven symms ridaho praised 
hamilton for taking a more conciliatory approach this year but both 
warned against raising taxes as a way of tackling the budget 
deficit 
even with the joint report both democrats and republicans felt 
the need to issue separate accompanying reports the democrats used 
their report to go into greater detail on various problems facing 
the economy while the republicans touted the successes of the 
reagan tax cuts in stimulating the 6year economic recovery the 
longest peacetime expansion in history 
four democratic members of the panel rep augustus f hawkins 
of california and sens paul sarbanes of maryland lloyd bentsen 
of texas and jeff bingaman of new mexico filed individual 
statements voicing concern that the committee may have glossed over 
serious problems in its effort to reach a consensus 
bentsen said that the us trade deficit which improved 
dramatically in 1988 is expected to worsen again this year 
exacerbating our dependence on foreign capital and causing the 
us foreign debt to balloon beyond 600 billion 
sarbanes a past chairman of the committee said he feared that 
this years report conveys an inappropriate sense of 
complacency 
over the past decade we have created unprecedented imbalances

israelis cleaned their houses of bread and 
other leavened foods tuesday and made lastminute preparations for 
the passover holiday that commemorates the exodus of the ancient 
israelites from egypt 
the jewish holiday begins wednesday evening with a traditional 
feast known as a seder 
the army organized seder meals on its bases but budget 
constraints forced it to cancel its main passover feast with 
dignitaries an army spokesman said 
the 16month palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip kept many soldiers on patrol but they received holiday 
care packages the spokesman said he said they contain all the 
needs to make a kosher seder matzo sweet red wine gefilte fish 
all kinds of good dishes 
many israelis headed for resorts to enjoy the holiday 
especially the red sea and sea of galilee 
lior raviv a manager at king solomon hotel at the red sea 
resort of eilat said he expects 600 people for passover dinner 
we started making the matzo balls tonight and will have made 
about 2000 by tomorrow afternoon he said 
matzo is the waferlike unleavened bread that the ancient 
israelites are said to have eaten during the exodus because they 
had no time to leaven yeast for bread most israelis today do not 
eat bread or other leavened goods during the holiday 
travel agents reported an increase of more than 10 percent in 
israeli travel abroad for the holiday yigal yardeni of peltours 
israels oldest travel agent said israelis went away for many 
reasons including to forget the uprising 
israelis want to escape not just this intefadeh uprising in 
the territories but the feeling of isolation that has accumulated 
in israel over the past 40 years they need this holiday to clear 
their heads he said 
in jerusalems ultraorthodox neighborhood of mea shearim the 
pungent smell of bleach hung in the air tuesday as families carried 
out traditional spring cleaning aimed at removing all bread and 
other leavened products from their homes 
religious seminary students removed books from synagogues 
tuesday to shake out any bread crumbs that might have lodged in the 
pages 
the countrys two chief rabbis symbolically sold all the states 
hametz forbidden passover foods to an arab lawyer from east 
jerusaelm for about 5500 the chief rabbinate said the sale is a 
traditional legal fiction reversed after the holiday

senate banking committee leaders on tuesday 
promised to support a bigger budget for the securities and exchange 
commission raising the possibility of a savingsandloan type 
scandal if the government relaxes its vigilance over financial 
markets 
when we fail to provide the funds needed to staff a regulatory 
agency then we leave too many opportunities for unscrupulous 
or simply incompetent individuals said sen christopher dodd 
dconn chairman of the securities subcommittee i hope we can 
apply the lessons from that savings and loan experience 
dodd was supported by sen john heinz of pennsylvania the 
senior republican on the subcommittee and sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich the chairman of the full committee 
heinz said that in one year drexel burnham lambert junk bond 
chief michael milken accused in the governments biggestever

sec chairman david s ruder complained that the secs staff 
total has remained almost flat since 1980 increasing from 2041 to 
2050 during a time when securities trading has mushroomed ruder 
is seeking budget authorization of 178 million in 1990 2126 
million in 1991 and 2381 million in 1992

investigators of a stock scandal that has shaken 
public trust in prime minister noburu takeshita and prompted 
resignations of three cabinet ministers said tuesday they will 
concentrate on prosecuting politicians 
they made the statement after bringing bribery charges against 
former vice minister of education kunio takaishi who was arrested 
march 28 
fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested in the 
scandal centering on the publishing and information conglomerate 
the recruit co they include takashi kato a former vice minister 
of labor and hisashi shinto former chairman of the 
telecommunications giant nippon telegraph and telephone corp 
prosecutors said tuesdays action concluded their inquiry into 
the government bureaucracys part in the scandal they said they 
will now focus on politicians 
at least 17 politicians or aides including those of takeshita 
and former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone reportedly received 
large profits from 1986 sales of stocks in a recruit subsidiary 
most of the politicians including takeshita have denied personal 
wrongdoing 
in a poll released sunday takeshitas popularity sank to 39 
percent an alltime low the survey followed his acknowledgement 
last week that he had received more than 1 million in political 
contributions from recruit 
opposition parties repeatedly have demanded that takeshita 
resign and call new elections because of the scandal but takeshita 
has vowed to stay on and push for ethics reform 
recruit sold unlisted shares at bargain prices to about 160 
influential politicians public officials and businessmen the 
recipients made large profits when the shares were listed shortly 
afterward for public trading and shot up in price 
investigators said tuesday that former recruit chairman hiromasa 
ezoe had sought takaishis help in blocking education ministry 
plans to impose new regulations on job placement magazines the 
publications are one of recruits main lines of business 
ezoe sold the 59yearold official 10000 shares of stock 
which were certain to rise in value and extremely difficult for 
the general public to obtain the prosecutors said 
according to a 1988 supreme court decision the sale of stock 
bound to rise in price and not available to the general public 
could amount to bribery 
takaishi resigned from the ministry in june 1988 to run for 
parliament but pulled out of the race after his links to the 
scandal were disclosed

a bill that would require broadcasters to air 
opposing views on controversial issues was approved by a senate 
committee tuesday 
the bill virtually identical to a measure passed by congress in 
1987 but vetoed by thenpresident reagan was sent to the full 
senate on a voice vote by the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee 
sen larry pressler rsd voted against the bill committee 
chairman ernest f hollings dsc noted that sen bob packwood 
rore also opposed the bill although he was not present for 
tuesdays vote 
the bill would write into law the socalled fairness doctrine 
that the federal communications commission repealed in 1987 a 
companion measure was passed out of committee april 11 to the 
house where it is awaiting floor action 
the justice department told house energy and commerce committee 
chairman john dingell dmich it was recommending that president 
bush veto the bill if it passes congress 
when the fcc overturned the fairness doctrine it cited first 
amendment concerns and also said the rules were outdated 
the doctrine had been promulgated in the 1940s on the premise 
that broadcasters should be required to be fair because only a few 
voices had access to public airwaves 
but critics such as packwood contend there is no shortage of 
voices today in this era of cable tv satellites and vcrs 
broadcasters claim the doctrine exerts a chilling effect on 
discussions of controversial issues and is unconstitutional 
but the bills primary sponsor sen daniel inouye dhawaii 
said the need for such legislation is greater than ever he said 
there is evidence broadcasters have been devoting less time to 
controversial issues since the fcc repealed the doctrine

bribery investigation 
rejecting attempts by news organizations to inspect the 
documents the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 30 that the 
public has no right to such material at least until a grand jury 
has issued indictments 
the ruling upheld decisions by judges in los angeles and san 
diego 
judge william norris said the publics interest in observing the 
judicial process is outweighed by the potential damage to an 
investigation including the risk of evidence being destroyed and 
innocent people being maligned 
more than a dozen people have been convicted or have pleaded 
guilty in the 2year operation ill wind probe in which contractors 
and consultants are accused of bribing pentagon officials for 
inside information useful in winning contracts 
federal prosecutors obtained 39 search warrants in 16 judicial

an alaska seafood group has proposed a 
413 million advertising campaign to reassure anxious consumers 
that state seafood remains pure despite last months oil spill 
at least part of the money could come from the exxon corp 
whose tanker ran aground march 24 and spilled 101 million gallons 
of north slope crude oil into one of the nations richest fishing 
grounds 
merry tuten executive director of the alaska seafood marketing 
institute outlined at a board meeting monday a major television 
campaign and ads in national and international seafood and consumer 
publications 
tuten told the joint state and industry group that the spending 
plan was a guesstimate and that a final budget could be much 
higher or much lower depending on the outcome of market 
research 
the tentative budget which has been submitted to gov steve 
cowper for review is nearly seven times the size of the 
institutes annual budget 
much of this years campaign pitches the virtues of pure 
alaska seafood from pristine coastal waters ads aimed at consumers 
spooked by reports of pollution in east coast fishing grounds 
in an april 7 letter to tuten exxons don cornett offered to 
finance a state marketing campaign to reassure consumers or 
wholesalers who believe that the supply or quality of alaska 
seafood will be affected 
based on your analysis we want your recommendations and 
budget figures for an appropriate marketing response the asmi 
would have control and exxon would be willing to provide 
appropriate funding 
but some board members worried that taking the money might 
hinder later efforts to collect damages from exxon tuten said any 
exxon financing will be reviewed first by the state attorney 
generals office

23 years that they were being billed for their neighbors water 
they took sponge baths and recycled dish water in futile attempts 
to reduce their bills

sisters were right and agreed to pay back everything they were 
owed 
i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown over the large 
water bills said mrs freeman 69 weve been counting the 
drops 
she said she took her first real bath at home this weekend for 
the first time in more than two decades it was wonderful she 
said 
the sisters troubles began in 1966 when this little town west 
of athens started charging for water by usage instead of a flat 
rate 
their bills started soaring although they did everything they 
could to cut down on water use set up a barrel to catch rain 
water took sponge baths recycled dish water even ate canned 
vegetables to avoid having to wash fresh ones 
finally city workers confirmed this month what the widows had 
suspected all along the water line to the house next door ran

oliver north and national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane collaborated in lies to congress reminiscent of 
the tactics adolf hitler used in ruling nazi germany the 
prosecutor said today in final arguments at norths irancontra 
trial 
north and mcfarlane were following adolf hitlers old 
strategy which is the victor will never be asked if he told the 
truth prosecutor john keker told the jury 
in rebuttal defense attorney brendan sullivan declared that 
anyone who links colonel north to adolf hitler is not credible 
and should not be believed he called the comparison outrageous 
this man is not adolf hitler sullivan said and he 
doesnt do things like adolf hitler 
in this case the government is off track and running wild 
and you should stop it he told the jurors who are expected to 
begin deliberating thursday 
keker also contended that north a former white house aide 
tried to clear himself of charges by claiming the devil made me 
do it 
north blames other people mcfarlane made me to it casey 
told me to do it he said william casey was cia director at the 
time 
keker also called north the joe isuzu of government for 
allegedly telling lies to the attorney general in november 1986 as 
the irancontra affair was erupting 
isuzu is a character in an television auto commercial who lies 
outrageously 
continuing his assault keker suggested that north stole money 
to help pay for a family car 
north is accused of 12 criminal charges including obstructing 
congress and making false statements to congress and the attorney 
general they focus on an alleged attempt to cover up various 
aspects of a secret reagan administration operation to aid the 
contra rebels in nicaragua when congress banned us aid 
conviction on all counts carries up to 60 years in prison and 3 
million in fines 
the tragedy of oliver north is that the man who cared so much 
for freedom in nicaragua forgot about the demands of freedom 
here at home said keker 
he said that if north had looked up when he went into the nov 
23 1986 interview with the attorney general he would have seen 
these words inscribed in stone 
where law ends tyranny begins 
keker said north responded to congressional inquiries in the 
late summer of 1985 by falsely denying that the national security 
council staff was assisting the nicaraguan rebels 
in preparing the letters north was shutting down 
obstructing halting fouling up the congressional inquries said 
keker 
north made similar denials a year later in a meeting with the 
house intelligence committee 
when he took the witness stand in his own defense north cried 
in describing the false statements he had made to the committee on 
aug 6 1986 
were they real tears or were they crocodile tears said 
keker when he lied to them he didnt shed any tears he was 
thorough and convincing 
north acknowledged that he didnt tell the committee the truth 
but said he didnt know he was breaking the law in doing so 
keker dismissed norths suggestions that he was following orders 
from top reagan administration officials such as mcfarlane and 
casey such claims are no more a defense than the devil made 
me do it the prosecutor said 
telling the truth is something you learned at your mothers 
knee prosecutor keker told the jury following eight weeks of 
testimony in the trial of the former white house aide 
government by deception is not a free government keker 
said government by deception is not a democratic government 
government by deception is not a government under the rule of law 
he said that in contrast to norths portrait of himself as a 
marine who simply followed orders the former national security 
council aide also described himself as a man of great power 
he said north did not hesitate to abuse that power by 
saying this is the white house calling whether the call was 
to cabinet officials or a car dealer 
keker contended that north stole some of the money in a 300000 
cash fund operated from his office safe to pay for a used car the 
fund was financed by contra leader adolfo calero and retired air 
force maj gen richard secord whom north had enlisted to run arms 
to the contras 
north testified that he got money for the gmc suburban vehicle 
from a metal box nailed to his closet floor at home 
oliver north gave you a story about buying that car which 
turns out not to be true keker told the jury 
he used the operational account in his office safe which 
was a source of liquid untraceable unaccountable funds said 
keker they were given to him without any strings attached at 
all 
keker said north also used travelers checks from calero as a 
personal piggy bank north is charged with unlawfully converting 
4300 in travelers checks to his own use 
former national security council staffer mary dix testified 
friday that north complained he was extremely short of cash on at 
least five occasions stopping suddenly in mid1985 
north says he was never tempted by the 300000 cash fund in 
his office said keker you dont need to be an accountant you 
dont need to be a lawyer to figure out what happened the 
prosecutor said use your common sense 
asked last week whether he got cash from secord the same day he 
had paid off the vehicle north said he couldnt recall

lech walesa shook hands tuesday with gen 
wojciech jaruzelski the man who ordered the solidarity founder 
arrested in 1981 and the polish leader said later he was 
satisified by the symbolic reconciliation 
walesa did not speak to reporters after the meeting with 
jaruzelski their first since nov 4 1981 five weeks before the 
martiallaw crackdown 
a fragment of the emotionally charged session appeared on polish 
tv news a mountain with a mountain said jaruzelski as he 
greeted walesa 
i hope we will never part again replied walesa 
jaruzelskis greeting was the beginning of a saying in polish 
that in full goes a mountain with a mountain cannot meet but a 
man can meet a man 
the facetoface meeting between the man who once sought to 
crush solidarity and the one who vowed to revive it lasted for 
about one hour in a comfortable reception room in the parliament 
building on a wooded bluff near downtown warsaw it occurred one 
day after solidarity was declared legal again 
jaruzelski rarely speaks to reporters but after the meeting he 
gave an impromptu news conference i feel satisfaction we have 
come a very difficult and long way he said 
reconciliation is a process not an act so if we talk about 
an act it is rather the round table referring to the two months 
of negotiations that led to agreements april 5 between the 
opposition and communist authorities 
outside the parliament building after the meeting walesa smiled 
and shook hands with jaruzelski gen czeslaw kiszczak the 
interior minister and other party and government leaders 
other opposition participants also were reserved in commenting 
on the meeting many of them were imprisoned following the dec 13 
1981 martiallaw decree issued by jaruzelski to suppress the east 
blocs first independent trade union 
later top union adviser bronislaw geremek said the round 
table started in an atmosphere of tension and expectation and later 
changed and today the meeting also began with some tension but 
later the atmosphere of the round table found its culmination 
speaking by telephone from his home the historian added the 
road to national reconciliation is long and rough and we are only 
at the beginning of this road 
official photographs showed walesa and jaruzelski laughing 
together in one photograph walesa had a glass of cognac on a 
table in front of him 
walesa wore his traditional solidarity pin and a badge with a 
picture of the black madonna of czestochowa polands most revered 
religious icon on his lapel 
the occasion was a reception given by jaruzelski immediately 
after the first meeting of the arbitration commmission a group set 
up to oversee implementation of economic and political reforms 
jaruzelski did not exclude further meetings with walesa telling 
reporters that such meetings will cease to be something 
extraordinary if there is a need i think we will be meeting make 
contacts i think all conditions exist for it 
he said the meeting obviously did not have a substantial 
character it was more symbolic but i think it was valuable as 
it creates a certain climate a certain mood which should spread 
to society 
jaruzelski led a reluctant communist party to allow 
reinstatement of solidarity and he hopes the movement will help in 
pulling poland out of its economic crisis 
during its first legal phase in 198081 the union claimed 10 
million members out of an 18 millionmember workforce union 
leaders expect solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million members 
now that it is legal again 
a government spokesman portrayed the meeting as a sign poland 
has changed course after the historic round table agreements that 
also permit the opposition to field independent candidates to the 
existing parliament and a new 100member senate 
a new chapter is starting in the history of poland and it 
seems that both of the politicians are characterized by a great 
sense of timing and a capacity to respond to the challenges of 
time said deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski 
besides jaruzelski prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski once 
an ardent defender of martial law the heads of polands two other 
communistallied political parties and other senior party and 
government officials were present 
walesa was accompanied by about a dozen top union leaders and 
advisers to the meeting some were casually dressed in jeans and 
sweaters 
in the busy first day of the reborn solidarity union walesa had 
a breakfast meeting with foreign minister roland dumas of france 
and said that poland must focus on solving its economic crisis now 
that the union is legal 
he then met with opposition leaders picking independent 
candidates for the june elections to parliament 
walesa and his wife danuta and several top advisers depart for 
rome on wednesday to meet with polishborn pope john paul ii

adnan khashoggi the flamboyant saudi 
financier once reputed to be the worlds wealthiest man was 
arrested tuesday on charges he helped ferdinand and imelda marcos 
hide riches stolen from the philippines 
the jetsetting arms merchant allegedly the man who brokered 
the irancontra arms deal was seized by police at an elegant bern 
hotel and jailed said pierre schmid assistant director of the 
swiss federal police office 
schmid said the arrest came shortly after the us embassy 
tipped off swiss authorities that khashoggi was in the capital and 
demanded his arrest 
the united states plans to submit a detailed extradition request 
within 60 days as required by treaty said us embassy spokesman 
michael korff 
khashoggi the marcoses five other people and a california bank 
were indicted in october by a us district court in new york 
the indictment accuses the ousted philippines dictator and his 
wife of stealing more than 100 million from the philippine 
treasury to buy real estate and expensive art objects in new york 
overall the philippines says the couple took 35 billion in 
cash and property 
the us government alleges that khashoggi 54 posed as owner 
of some of the assets to help hide that they actually belonged to 
marcos prosecutors have said 
khashoggi is charged with racketeering conspiracy obstruction 
of justice and mail fraud racketeering alone carries a penalty of 
up to 20 years in prison 
swiss authorities said a us diplomatic note demanding 
khashoggis arrest cited four buildings in manhattan and a 
collection of paintings that disappeared from a manila museum 
khashoggi allegedly bought them for marcos as part of obfuscation 
maneuvers during the expresidents reign schmid said 
marcos fled into exile in hawaii after the february 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising that put corazon aquino in power 
under the usswiss extradition treaty swiss authorities must 
decide whether khashoggis alleged offenses are considered criminal 
acts under both us and swiss law 
police arrested khashoggi in a gentlemanly way without using 
handcuffs at the downtown fivestar hotel schweizerhof where he 
was staying manager jeanjacques gauer told the associated press 
he was taken to the nearby district jail the swiss justice 
ministry said schmid indicated bail was likely to be set 
exceptionally high 
khashoggi 54 arrived in switzerland on monday for unidentified 
medical treatment said a wellplaced swiss official speaking on 
condition of anonymity khashoggi who has lived in paris has 
visited a bern hospital in the past for rejuvenating fresh cell 
therapy 
his office in saudi arabia declined immediate comment on the 
arrest 
the philippines claims that after the marcoses went into exile 
their agents and khashoggi carted away 25 paintings from new york 
properties owned by the marcoses the action allegedly came after a 
california federal judge ordered that none of the marcoses 
property could be moved 
khashoggi allegedly sold 12 paintings for 32 million 
khashoggi was quoted by a saudi newspaper in october as denying 
the allegations contained in the indictment and classifying the 
case as a civil rather than criminal action 
khashoggi has 10 days to file an appeal and request his release 
the federal tribunal switzerlands supreme court would have the 
final say if he fights an extradition order 
born in mecca as one of 14 children of the late king ibn sauds 
personal physician khashoggi became known for his flamboyant 
lifestyle and business talent 
he figured in several kickback scandals with us aircraft 
manufacturers allegedly paying him large amounts for arranging 
billiondollar defense contracts 
he reputedly was the main financier and broker in the 
irancontra affair where proceeds from sales of us arms to iran 
allegedly were funneled to rebels fighting nicaraguas leftist 
government 
khashoggi said in 1986 he lost 10 million on the deal 
published reports once estimated khashoggis personal wealth at 
up to 4 billion and he was reported to be the richest man in the 
world but falling oil prices stricter control of arms dealing and 
lossmaking deals recently have reportedly left him in financial 
straits 
mrs marcos has pleaded innocent to the charges contained in the 
us indictment marcos has said he is too ill to appear in new 
york for legal proceedings

the house prepared today to accept a federal 
commissions recommendations to shut down 86 military bases but 
some members maintained that the final list was not a fair one 
we do need to address the wide expenditure of taxpayers money 
but we have a right to expect competence honesty and 
fairness said rep john porter rill at the start of debate 
on a resolution to reject the commissions plan 
in the cases of fort sheridan and chanute air force base in his 
state of illinois porter claimed we got uninformed judgment we 
got an unintelligent approach 
he argued that the information the commission used in estimating 
the bases value was outdated and erroneous 
both democratic and republican leaders said the house was 
certain to accept the commissions plan 
its time to get serious about deficit reduction said rep 
ronald machtley rri obsolete bases have drained our 
resources the recommendations are the only viable option for 
cutting expenditures of funds 
last month the house armed services committee voted 434 to 
support the report by the commission on base realignment and 
closure as the commission is formally known 
although they acknowledged that the resolution to disapprove 
will likely be defeated lawmakers from new jersey california and 
illinois continued to plead with their colleagues monday 
weve been told mistakes have been made rep jim 
saxton rnj said in a speech on the chamber floor the house 
has an opportunity not to be party to that mistake 
in debate last week lawmakers cited congressional reports that 
found the commission used incorrect information as a basis for its 
decision and overestimated savings from the base closings 
savings from the plan which also includes substantial changes 
at 54 other facilities are estimated at 694 million a year at 
first savings over 20 years are estimated at 56 billion 
the law requires that congress either reject the entire plan or 
allow it to go into effect as s 
in a related development monday the national federation of 
federal employees filed suit against the goverment to prevent the 
closings saying the law creating the commission was 
unconstitutional 
the lawsuit filed in us district court said the base closure 
and realignment act violates the constitution by improperly 
delegating the important legislative function of regulating the 
disposition of government property to the unelected secretary of 
defense and to the unelected members of the commission 
the union represents 5000 employees at george air force base 
and norton air force base in california and chanute air force base 
in illinois all three bases are scheduled to be closed 
james m peirce president of the union said the commission 
based its decision on erroneous and out of date information 
to put it simply the commission blew it and it doesnt appear 
as if the majority of congress gives a damn he said 
the union is seeking a declaratory judgment from the courts on 
whether the base closure and realignment act is unconstitutional

the supreme court on tuesday gave consumers a 
chance to recover through antitrust lawsuits the extra money they 
spend because of illegally inflated prices 
by a 70 vote the justices said state laws may allow those 
indirectly affected by illegal pricefixing to sue for monetary 
damages 
lower courts had struck down such state laws ruling that they 
are precluded by the federal antitrust laws bar on suits by 
indirect purchasers 
this is an extremely important victory for the american 
consumer said ramon klitzke a marquette university law 
professor who had studied the case decided tuesday 
i foresee many cases in which lawyers representing consumers 
will pursue antitrust remedies in state courts and consumer 
associations will file class action lawsuits in behalf of 
numerous consumers klitzke said 
in other matters the court 
ruled that international airline passengers do not have to be 
told beforehand that they cannot collect more than 75000 in the 
event of an accident 
the court in a unanimous decision stemming from the 1983 
shooting down of a korean air lines jet in soviet airspace freed 
kal from having to pay more than the 75000 perpassenger limit 
because the airline failed to give adequate warnings on tickets 
ruled unanimously in a massachusetts case that states may 
prosecute employers for withholding accrued vacation pay owed fired 
workers 
was urged during a courtroom argument session to strike down as 
unconstitutional some of the huge punitivedamages awards won in 
personalinjury cases and other lawsuits 
the pricefixing decision reinstated efforts by four states 
california minnesota alabama and arizona to participate in a 
32 million settlement of an alleged nationwide conspiracy to fix 
cement prices 
at least 11 other states and the district of columbia have 
enacted antitrust laws giving indirect purchasers the right to sue 
the states are colorado hawaii illinois kansas maryland 
michigan mississippi new mexico rhode island south dakota and 
wisconsin 
klitzke predicted that attorneys general in other states now 
will recommend to their legislatures that similar laws be enacted 
the courts ruling restores a right the nations consumers 
enjoyed until a 1977 decision by the justices 
in that decision the court had interpreted federal antitrust 
law as barring most lawsuits by ultimate consumers even if they 
suffer the most harm from the illegal conduct 
under the 1977 ruling if a manufacturer illegally conspires to 
fix a products price and sells it to a retailer the retailer may 
use federal antitrust law to sue for triple damages 
but if the retailer passes on the illegally inflated price when 
selling the product federal law bars the consumer from suing 
tuesdays decision however allows such customers to sue under 
state antitrust laws 
a spate of lawsuits was filed against cement manufacturers in 
1976 and 1977 alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices each 
of the four states involved in todays court action filed a suit 
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers 
four states sought to sue on behalf of county and municipal 
governments that had purchased cement or products containing cement 
the litigation was consolidated in federal court in arizona and 
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay 32 million to 
settle the case 
direct purchasers then challenged the states right to be 
compensated for indirect purchases 
a federal trial judge later upheld by the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals threw out the states suits 
writing for the high court justice byron r white said that 
allowing enforcement of state antitrust laws protecting indirect 
purchasers does not impair the effectiveness of federal antitrust 
law 
justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor did not 
participate in the case for unannounced reasons

a small amount of radiation was released 
earlier this year when a nuclear weapons experiment went awry a 
spokesman for sandia national laboratories has confirmed 
the incident occurred feb 3 on the tonopah test range about 
200 miles northwest of las vegas 
sandia spokesman nigel hey said an 8inch howitzer cannon shell 
filled with electronic equipment and radioactive material was fired 
above the range hey said a parachute attached to the shell failed 
to open and the shell penetrated the earth instead of floating 
gently to the ground 
the device did not explode hey said 
sandia officials decided the next day to blow up the dummy 
warhead with dynamite rather than move it 
hey said the explosion contaminated an 80squarefoot area of 
the test range with small amounts of uranium state health 
officials say snow in the area prevented sandia officials from 
cleaning up the contaminated area for 20 days 
bill schneider chief of the bureau of regulatory services for 
the state division of health said health officials monitored the 
ground for radiation on march 7 and found no contamination 
sandia is an energy department contractor and conducts several 
experiments a year in conjunction with the departments office of

president bush reassured conservatives that he 
still supports the idea of tuition tax credits for parents of 
private school students according to those who met with him 
tuesday 
in addition bush received high marks after a white house 
meeting with a group of evangelical christians and other 
conservatives for the personal example he sets by attending church 
services every sunday and by his concern for people 
on behalf of the evangelicals we are extremely pleased with 
mr bush said billy zeoli president of gospel films who added 
that more than any policy directive it was mostly his example 
that encouraged them 
asked if he was implying criticism of former president reagan 
who spoke often of christian values but rarely went to church 
zeoli said he was making no comparison and that everyone has 
their own style 
the group discussed other familycentered issues including 
bushs childcare proposal and the recent washington march by 
hundreds of thousands of proabortion supporters 
on march 29 bush had raised conservative concerns when he told 
a student who asked if his parents should get a tax break for 
paying tuition to send their son to a private school no they 
shouldnt bush added cant afford to do that 
when the conservatives told him tuesday of their worries about 
those comments the president indicated there had been some 
confusion and that philosophically he still thought credits were 
good but that the budget would not allow it according to gary 
bauer president of the conservative family research council and 
one of those at the meeting 
bauer interviewed by telephone and others who spoke to 
reporters outside the white house said they were satisfied with 
bushs assurances they said they recognized the budget argument 
and were happy at least with his philosophical stance 
white house press spokesman bj cooper said that bush has not 
wavered in his support for the idea of tuition tax credits but 
that as the president had said on march 29 the constraints of the 
federal budget and the need to maintain revenues are not conducive 
to creating such a program this year 
in those earlier comments bush had told the boy who questioned 
him everybody should support the public school system and then 
if on top of that your parents think that they want to shell out 
in addition to the tax money tuition money thats their right 
but i dont think they should get a break for that 
the reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax 
credits for parents sending children to private schools but 
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system 
bushs march 29 comments caused robert dugan jr director of 
the national association of evangelicals to send a letter 
expressing dismay about bushs apparent shift of position 
the conservatives who in the past have been suspicious of 
bushs commitment to many of their causes were generally 
complimentary of him after tuesdays meeting 
as a general rule evangelicals are happy and pleased with the 
job the president has been doing said adrian rogers former 
president of the southern baptist convention 
there was much discussion on abortion with the conservatives 
indicating they hoped the massive turnout by the prochoice group 
would not make bush soften his antiabortion stance 
bush said tuesday that he supported the right of the protesters 
to voice their opinions said jerry vines president of the 
southern baptist convention 
however he was very reassuring in his statement opposed to 
abortion said bauer

the supreme court ruled tuesday that 
international airline passengers do not have to be warned by 
carriers even in the fine print that they can collect no more 
than 75000 apiece in air disasters 
in a case stemming from the soviet downing of a korean air lines 
jet that claimed 269 lives in 1983 the court said an airlines 
failure to alert passengers to the 75000 limit does not expose it 
to greater financial penalties 
by a 90 vote the justices said kal will not be penalized for 
its failure to use the proper size type on its tickets to alert 
passengers to the 75000 limit 
such warnings generally alert passengers that they must buy 
private insurance if they want additional financial protection 
while the court was unanimous in shielding kal from larger 
damages the justices were sharply divided in granting airlines 
even broader protection from costly lawsuits 
by a 54 vote the court said an international agreement known 
as the warsaw convention does not force airlines to give passengers 
any adequate warning on their tickets that there is a 75000 
damage limit 
justice antonin scalia writing for the court said the 
warsaw convention does not eliminate the limitation on damages for 
passenger injury or death as a sanction for failure to provide 
adequate notice of that limitation 
in a separate concurring opinion justice william j brennan 
took issue with the breadth of scalias opinion 
brennan said scalias opinion means airlines are free to give 
passengers no warning at all about how much they can collect under 
the courts decision brennan said the only time an airline could 
be forced to pay more than 75000 is when no passenger ticket at 
all is delivered 
the ruling permits airlines to omit any warning about their 
financial liability even in the fine print brennan continued 
notice that is not minimally legible at the least is no 
notice at all he said 
joining in his concurring opinion were justices thurgood 
marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
tuesdays case has its origins with the flight of kal flight 7 
which was en route from new york city to seoul korea when it was 
shot down by a soviet military airplane sept 1 1983 the kal jet 
flew more than 300 miles off course and entered soviet airspace 
over the sea of japan 
all aboard were killed including rep lawrence mcdonald dga 
many of the victims families including mcdonalds widow sued 
kal in various federal courts the wrongfuldeath lawsuits were 
consolidated and presented to a federal trial judge here 
lawyers for the victims families in 1984 asked us district 
judge aubrey e robinson jr to declare that kal was not eligible 
for the 75000perdeath cap imposed by the warsaw convention 
a separate private pact among airlines the montreal agreement 
says the notice of the 75000 limit must be specified in print 
size no smaller than 10point type 
the kal tickets announced the limit in 8point type 
robinson ruled in favor of korean air lines and the us circuit 
court of appeals here upheld his decision in 1987 dismissing the 
suit by the passengers families

new residential construction suffered its 
second straight decline in march the government said tuesday in a 
report that analysts cited as evidence the housing industry will 
bear the brunt of a campaign to restrain economic growth 
the commerce department report said construction of new homes 
and apartments dropped 54 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 14 million units in march after plunging 12 percent in 
february 
construction of singlefamily homes slowed to an annual pace of 
994000 units the slowest rate since january 1985 while starts of 
multifamily dwellings fell 88 percent to an annual rate of 
403000 units 
applications for building permits meanwhile fell 137 percent 
in march after dropping 61 percent in the preceding month that 
was the biggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in october 
1981 in the early stages of the last recession 
tuesdays report contained nothing but negatives for the 
nations housing industry said david seiders chief economist for 
the national association of home builders 
but that was seen as good news by those worried about 
accelerating inflation who hope that slower economic growth will 
help restrain price increases 
analysts said the march report showed that housing is feeling 
the pinch of interest rates pushed upward by the federal reserve 
board as part of its campaign to restrain the economy and check 
inflation 
fixedrate 30year mortgages are now averaging 1111 percent 
up almost one full percentage point from a year ago according to a 
national survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
housing is always something that gets hit hard by higher 
interest rates said economist john hagens of the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa the interestsensitive sectors of the economy 
will bear the brunt of any downturn 
thomas holloway senior economist for the mortgage bankers 
association said further weakness in housing is likely to show up 
in the next few months but if were lucky the housing sector 
will probably emerge a little stronger than it is right now 
nevertheless a growing number of analysts are worried that the 
federal reserve is unlikely to complete its antiinflation campaign 
without pushing the country into a recession with housing leading 
the way downward 
housing is likely to lead us into a significant slowdown and 
ultimately probably a mild recession said allen sinai chief 
economist for the boston co that probably will be the price paid 
to get inflation down 
economist michael sumichrast publisher of a housing newsletter 
said the federal reserves tight money policy was killing housing 
very successfully 
its clearly a housing recession sumichrast said i think 
its fair to say we are in the forefront of a recession i dont 
think you can really turn it around any more 
the weakness in march was led by a steep 341 percent drop in 
construction activity in the northeast where housing starts fell 
to an annual rate of 149000 units the slowest pace in the region 
since september 1983 
seiders said that decline represented an inventory 
correction after heavy overbuilding in the region earlier in the 
1980s when demand was strong and prices were rising 
starts of new homes and apartments were off 52 percent in the 
south dropping to an annual rate of 546000 units while starts in 
the west dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395000 units 
the midwest was the only region to enjoy an increase in 
activity with new construction climbing 104 percent to an annual 
rate of 307000 units 
the 137 percent decline in building permits in march left 
permits at an annual rate of 122 million units the slowest pace 
since october 1982

soccer fans kicked harassed and urinated on 
police as the officers tried to rescue victims of the sheffield 
stadium disaster a conservative lawmaker charged tuesday 
the government officially began its inquiry into the tragedy 
britains worst sports disaster during the night the death of a 
14yearold boy pushed the death toll to 95 
police have been sharply criticized for their handling of crowd 
on saturday at hillsborough stadium where the deaths occurred just 
minutes into an english association cup semifinal match between 
liverpool and nottingham forest 
irvine patnick a conservative member of parliament representing 
sheffield said officers told him liverpool fans hindered police as 
they tried to save people similar claims attributed to 
undientified police officers appeared in press reports 
they told me they were hampered harassed punched kicked and 
urinated on by liverpool fans patnick said all of this 
happened to them and now they are being blamed 
i saw the bruising on their bodies and the state they were in 
and there is no doubt in my mind that it is true 
south yorkshires chief ambulance officer don page said one of 
his men needed hospital treatment after being attacked as he 
treated an injured fan 
the stadium disaster occurred when thousands of fans were 
allowed to enter an already crowded standingroomonly terrace 
area spectators were trampled in the rush or suffocated against a 
10foot fence built to keep fans off the field 
of the 170 people injured 25 still were being treated in 
hospitals including 19 in intensive care 
writs were filed in liverpool high court tuesday for nine of the 
injured they are seeking damages for personal injuries and 
alleging negligence or breach of duty by south yorkshire chief 
constable peter wright and the sheffield wednesday soccer club 
news reports have centered on speculation that the deaths may 
have been caused by a police decision to open a gate to relieve 
crowding outside the stadium admitting the flood of latecomers 
appeals judge peter taylor who is heading the government 
inquiry said it was too early to pinpoint the major issues 
the focus of the inquiry will be to find out what happened and 
make recommendations as to how this situation can be avoided in the 
future he said at a sheffield news conference with west midlands 
chief constable geoffrey dear who is conducting a separate inquiry 
into the actions of south yorkshire police 
home secretary douglas hurd however told the house of commons

mississippi which has one of the nations 
highest illiteracy rates and some of its poorest school districts 
launched a campaign tuesday to put teaching computers into every 
public elementary school 
the state will raise 13 million for the project over four years 
with the help of two foundations 
gov ray mabus said the riordan foundation of los angeles and 
the rord foundation of new york will make an initial investment of 
15 million to begin installing computers this fall and raise an 
additional 55 million over the next three years he said the 
state would provide about 15 million a year in matching funds 
the computer learning system would be made available to 
kindergartens and firstgrades 
we have a goal in mississippi for everybody to read and write 
i think today we are taking a big step in that direction mabus 
said a news conference with richard riordan of the riordan 
foundation and richard dowling of the rorn foundation 
the foundations presented the first 15 million to the governor 
mabus said he hoped to get the computer labs which include 
computer work stations listening library station and other working 
areas in place in about onethird of the school districts by this 
fall the state has about 150 school districts 
the program will use an ibm system called writing to read 
which allows children to write anything they can say and read what 
they write the system also allows children to learn at their own 
pace 
we feel this is the way to teach literacy it is a very 
wonderful system the kids love it riordan said what happens 
is they hear the words they play games with it they cant wait to 
get into the labs for the next session 
if they are slow it doesnt criticize them they really good 
about themselves he said 
mabus and his wife julie have vowed to fight illiteracy in the 
state based on 1980 census data state officials estimate that as 
many as 400000 adults in mississippi have less than nine years of 
formal education and that most of them are functionally illiterate 
mabus said the projects goal is to ensure that every child in 
mississippi can read and write by the time they leave the first 
grade 
what we are talking about is giving our students and teachers 
the very best tools to teach reading and writing mississippi will 
be the first state in the country to our knowledge to have such 
an extensive computer literacy system for its children he said 
riordon said his foundation has provided for similar computer 
learning systems in several california cities and in kansas city 
mo chicago and new york but said most of those were pilot 
projects 
he said this was the foundations first statewide effort

collective farm directors are wary and confused 
about new laws permitting them to lease land but most see the move 
toward private property as the only way to increase production 
according to a survey published tuesday 
of the 176 heads of collective farms questioned by the kursk 
agricultural institute only onefifth believed strongly in leasing 
and nearly half answered i have doubts about it but i just 
dont see any other way 
results were published in the communist party daily newspaper 
pravda 
the conviction is widespread that the attitude toward leasing 
could flip by 180 degrees one fine moment and goodbye to the 
valuables attained through sweat and blood wrote y vorobyov 
dean of the institute in kursk a southwestern russian city 
onefifth of the farmers believed leasing would only make things 
worse and 7 percent consider the situation so far gone that they 
dont see any way out of it pravda said 
president mikhail s gorbachev told party leaders last month 
they must give farmers a feeling they are masters of the land 
because billions of dollars worth of investment brought only 
marginal increases in harvest 
on april 9 a new decree was published giving soviet citizens 
sweeping rights to lease land for 50 or more years pass it on to 
their children and sublease it the decree created property rights 
that had been virtually nonexistent under 70 years of communism 
the leasing decrees success in bringing economic improvement is 
expected to depend on the bureaucrats who have the power to enact 
the reforms or block them 
asked about the main obstacles to leasing 38 percent of the 
surveys respondents cited farmers reluctance to undertake a new 
enterprise 34 percent pointed to farm specialists disbelief that 
the leasing would really be serious and longterm and 22 
percent cited unclear ideas among farm leaders themselves about 
what leasing meant 
in all however almost twothirds saw leasing as a positive 
phenomenon pravda reported 
vorobyov wrote that two years ago a similar survey asked more 
than 500 farm specialists if they planned to lease land and 25 
percent gave a categorical no while only 10 percent said they 
did 
we have been taught by the bitter experience of the past 
pravda said referring to the collectivization period of the 1930s 
when millions of peasants were forced to give up their land to 
collective farms

in jobs and education by the majority sinhalese

americans in record numbers are writing and 
telephoning the supreme court to express their views on abortion 
but a court spokeswoman says its all to no avail 
i hope they understand this is not a popularity contest we 
are not keeping score of who favors abortion and who does not 
toni house said about the tens of thousands of letters and hundreds 
of telephone calls reaching the court each day 
ms house the courts public information officer said while 
people have a right to write to the court i hope they do not expect 
that the enunciation of their opinion will have any effect on the 
justices 
the court is to hear arguments april 26 in a key abortionrights 
case from missouri in which the justices are being asked to 
overturn or substantially limit their landmark 1973decision 
legalizing abortion 
ms house said the volume of court mail and calls increased 
dramatically when the justices last january agreed to study the 
missouri case and that switchboard operators and mailroom 
employees have been laboring against the rising tide since the 
massive march on washington by abortion rights advocates earlier 
this month 
in normal times the court receives about 1000 pieces of mail 
daily the courts mailroom was inundated with an estimated 46000 
letters monday nearly 19000 more arrived tuesday 
some send more than letters the court has received a number of 
clothes hangers grisly symbols of illegal abortions and numerous 
photographs of aborted fetuses 
people should understand the difference between this branch of 
government and the legislative and executive branches where public 
feedback is part and parcel of what they do ms house said 
this is not like writing to a member of congress its 
ineffective 
nevertheless ms houses willingness to talk about the public 
outpouring likely indicates that it has not gone unnoticed by at 
least some of the justices 
mail addressed to a particular justice is delivered to his or 
her chambers it is not known how many of the justices actually 
read any of the letters 
as best i can tell most of them do not ms house said 
most callers do not get beyond the courts switchboard 
operators although some end up talking to ms house or her 
assistants virtually none reaches a justices chambers 
in a speech in seattle last weekend justice harry a blackmun 
said he is receiving voluminous mail about abortion and 
indicated he is reading at least some of it 
the author of the courts 1973 ruling in roe vs wade blackmun 
said some writers have branded him morally rotten and 
responsible for the deaths of more babies than anyone in the 
world 
blackmun has received thousands of such letters for years and 
has told some at the court that he has developed a tolerance to 
abusive language 
justice sandra day oconnor viewed as a pivotal vote is 
receiving more abortionrelated mail than any other member of the 
court ms house said 
much of the mail appears to be orchestrated a great deal of 
it is preprinted and is merely signed by the mailer ms house 
said thats true on both sides of the issue

the massive exxon oil spill in alaskas prince 
william sound has blackened the image of the entire oil industry 
and thrust it into a pivotal time in its history energy 
secretary james d watkins said tuesday 
every oil company will have to confront the images created by 
the spill watkins said in a speech to the national petroleum 
council a group of private energy officials that advises the 
energy secretary on policy issues 
watkins said his department would attempt to persuade congress 
and the general public that the march 24 spill of 10 million 
gallons of alaskan crude by the tanker exxon valdez was an 
aberration that should not halt oil development in alaska 
were going to talk about the track record of the industry 
6 billion barrels of crude shipped out of valdez in a dozen years 
on nearly 9000 tankers with virtually no environmental damage 
until now watkins said 
he stressed however that the enormity of the exxon spill had 
galvanized public opinion in a way that evolving problems such as 
us reliance on foreign oil could not 
obviously the oil industry has suddenly and tragically 
reached a pivotal time in its history watkins said adding that 
it would require efforts by the entire industry to recover from 
public relations damage caused by the valdez spill 
watkins said his department would continue to lobby for 
legislation permitting oil companies to explore for oil in the 
arctic national wildlife refuge a senate bill offering such 
authorization was approved by the energy and natural resources 
committee in early march but was put on hold after the exxon spill 
were going to attempt to break the linkage that im 
afraid is developing in the publics mind that the valdez incident 
means that we no longer can risk new development on the north 
slope watkins said 
watkins said pursuit of possible oil discoveries in the arctic 
refuge was justified as a means of limiting the nations growing 
dependence on imported oil 
our vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is greater today 
than it was at the time of the arab oil embargo and becoming more 
apparent to the american public as we approach and perhaps pass the 
50 percent oil import mark he said

government forces reopened kabuls 
main overland supply route that had been blocked by moslem 
guerrillas and a convoy of 1300 trucks and other vehicles resumed 
its journey toward the capital tuesday officials said 
in the battle for the eastern city of jalalabad the guerrillas 
launched another assault attacking it from four directions said 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani 
foreign journalists saw about 200 trucks from the convoy reach a 
government checkpoint on the salang highway just north of the 
capital tuesday amani said more would arrive throughout the night 
and wednesday 
he said the convoy which was blocked for more than a week 
began moving again after the government soldiers dislodged the 
usbacked guerrillas from two posts on the highway 
helicopter gunships provided air cover for the convoy which 
included a few crowded buses and taxis gunfire was heard as the 
vehicles moved south but truck drivers said it was not serious 
government troops in armored personnel carriers waved their caps 
and cheered as they saw the convoys vehicles approach the capital 
after the departure of soviet troops in february soviet 
supplies continued to move down the 260mile salang highway until 
the guerrillas blocked it on april 6 
the government on tuesday sent a separate convoy of about 105 
trucks from kabul to jalalabad about 75 miles to the east amani 
said he said he believed the vehicles had reached the city 
however some guards at a checkpoint about 10 miles east of 
kabul said the road was closed others said it was open most of the 
way 
that road has been blocked for more than two weeks by 
pakistanibased guerrillas who have been attacking jalalabad since 
march 6 
amani said 18 civilians were killed and 21 wounded in the 
jalalabad fighting two government soldiers were killed and five 
injured while 47 guerrillas died and 19 were injured he said 
the usbacked guerrillas have made jalalabad the target of 
their first major offensive since the departure of the soviet 
troops who had been helping the marxist government 
amani also reported 32 guerrillas killed in battles to the south 
there was no way to confirm those reports independently 
in other fighting guerrillas attacked a district near the 
southern city of khost amani said he said no civilians or 
government troops were killed but 18 guerrillas died 
government forces also battled guerrillas in the southern 
province of kandahar killing 14 and wounding 40 amani said

nasa rolled out a fullscale model of 
its next generation space shuttle for public viewing tuesday with 
hopes it will impress those holding the purse strings for the 
nations space program 
the 115foot mockup of the planned shuttlec an unmanned 
cargocarrying space shuttle was put together in a hanger at 
marshall space flight center for about 500000 
the model will be shown to visiting congressman and other vips 
and is expected to become part of bus tours through marshall 
operated by the alabama space and rocket center 
it might also travel to nasas kennedy space center so 
technicians can practice handling future space shuttle vehicles 
its more than just something to look at its a design tool 
that our engineers will use in deciding how systems theyre working 
on will fit in full scale and how they would be used and ultimately 
how we would handle something like shuttlec said larry russell 
a marshall engineer 
the national aeronautics and space administration hopes to get 
the first funds for a 15 billion shuttlec development program in 
its fiscal 1991 budget with the program managed through marshall 
the center is responsible for development and management of the 
space shuttle fleets main engines booster rockets and external 
fuel tanks 
as proposed by marshall engineers shuttlec would be a wingless 
version of the existing space shuttles using the same propulsion 
systems two shuttle main engines external fuel tank and two solid 
fuel booster rockets 
shuttlec would weigh about 75000 pounds empty less than half 
the weight of the 174000pound manned orbiters it could carry 
payloads in its 16by82foot cargo bay as heavy as 145000 pounds 
three times the weight current shuttles can lift 
unlike its manned counterparts however shuttlec could not be 
reused and would be discarded like old booster rockets 
we need a heavy lift vehicle to get major pieces of the space 
station into orbit and we think shuttlec is what we need said 
jr thompson marshall director and deputy nasa 
administratordesignate 
nasa could fly a working version of shuttlec by 1994 if 
congressional funding begins next year russell said

these folks want to run the presidency from capitol hill and 
they want to have the supreme court enact the laws that capitol 
hill does not dare bork said 
the fact is that our political parties have grown increasingly

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday the united states has extremely limited influence on the 
warring factions in lebanon and can do little through diplomatic or 
political pressure to improve the situation 
it is a great tragedy that is very very intractable baker 
told the senate foreign relations commitee it does not lend 
itself to an easy solution 
he said that for all practical purposes the state department is 
limited to issuing statements strongly deploring the violence 
urging a ceasefire and calling for the withdrawal of syrian forces 
from the country 
we make a lot of statements and sometimes it is frustrating to 
think that is really about all we can do baker said i dont 
know what else frankly we can do we have scant influence with 
the syrians 
baker said president bush discussed the lebanon situation 
earlier in the day with french president francois mitterrand but 
he did not elaborate 
in paris presidential spokesman hubert vedrine said mitterrand 
had contacted bush as well as british prime minister margaret 
thatcher and several other world leaders to solicit their help in 
ending the war 
baker said that some people believe there ought to be somehow 
some greater activity or action on the part of the united states 
either unilaterally or acting jointly with france 
we dont see the potential for that right now he said 
responding to questions baker said that the united states is 
urging international support for mediation efforts by the 21nation 
arab league to bring a stop to fighting between christian and 
moslem forces 
it is our view that the initiative that has the greatest 
chance of success is the initiative of the arab league baker 
said 
sen nancy landon kassebaum rkan asked if it would help 
matters to call the us ambassadors to lebanon and syria home for 
consultation 
i dont know how much a statement recalling ambassadors would 
make baker replied 
the situation in lebanon remains a rebuke to everyones hopes 
for a restoration of stability and independence for that tragic 
country baker said 
casualties from the fighting in lebanon during the past six 
weeks total at least 270 killed and 975 wounded 
syria maintains about 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league mandate

the continuing turmoil in afghanistan will 
tarnish the international atmosphere unless an end to the 
fighting is found a washingtonbased soviet diplomat said tuesday 
everybody is going to lose if the conflict continues said 
oleg derkovsky counselor at the soviet embassy 
derkovsky in a meeting with a group of reporters repeated 
soviet charges that pakistan has violated the unmediated geneva 
accord which oversaw the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
afghanistan on feb 15 
in recent weeks the soviets have repeatedly accused pakistan of 
interfering in afghanistan by supporting moslem guerrillas in their 
decadelong fight to topple kabuls government 
the geneva accord calls for pakistan and afghanistan not to 
interfere in each others internal affairs the united states and 
soviet union are guarantors of the pact which was signed last year 
but the united states has vowed to continue to support the 
rebels as long as moscow continues to ship munitions to the kabul 
the rebel leaders are based in pakistan which has funneled much of 
the us weaponry and support to the rebels over the years 
derkovsky called the conflict in light of the soviet pullout 
a civil war that will grow into a regional conflict 
regional conflicts tarnish the international atmosphere the 
diplomat said 
he charged the united states with violating the spirit of the 
accord and called the us decision to send a special ambassador to 
the rebel factions not a helpful step 
the soviet official who questioned the us policy of not 
recognizing the kabul regime said the act confuses the 
situation because the official would not be dealing with a 
recognized government 
the officials statement came a day after us ambassador thomas 
r pickering said the prosoviet afghan government has turned to 
the united nations security council in a bid to retain its waning 
grip on afghanistan 
the ambassadors of cuba east germany and mongolia had called 
monday for a unarranged ceasefire and an international 
conference to set up a coalition government in afghanistan 
the new us ambassador accused kabul of trying to involve other 
nations in its struggle for political survival 
the afghan people themselves must be allowed to determine 
their own future without outside interference or coercion 
pickering told the council

a group of house republicans introduced 
legislation tuesday to repeal parts of the catastrophic health 
expansion of medicare passed last year mainly the income tax 
surcharge imposed on the welltodo elderly to help finance the 
program 
the measure unveiled at a news conference would keep most of 
the major benefits of the program but revamp a prescription drug 
benefit and make its more generous provisions apply only to 
lowincome medicare beneficiaries not poor enough to qualify for 
medicaid 
however the measure passed by overwhelming margins with 
bipartisan support in both the house and senate last year despite 
vocal opposition from those opposed to the surcharge feature and 
was signed into law by thenpresident reagan with great fanfare 
that surcharge that has provoked a barrage of letters to members 
of congress even though it does not apply not apply at all to any 
of the estimated 60 percent of the 32 million medicare 
beneficiaries who do not have enough income to pay federal taxes 
of the 40 percent subject to the surcharge only those couples 
with annual incomes of 100000 or so would be subject to the 
maximum surcharge of 800 a person or 1600 per couple that 
frequently is cited as example of the additional burden placed on 
the elderly to pay for the program 
rep michael bilirakis dfla a lead sponsor of the 
legislation acknowledged in an interview that many of his own 
constituents who have complained mistakenly believe they will be 
subject to an income tax surcharge 
bilirakis and other sponsors also acknowledged that getting 
their bill passed will be an uphill fight and that their first 
hurdle will be to get a hearing for their legislation in the 
democraticcontrolled house 
but bilirakis said he is hopeful the letters of complaint 
reaching capitol hill will have the same impact as the outpouring 
of opposition to a recent proposal for a congressional pay raise 
on that issue he said they bombed us and bombed us and 
bombed us and finally congress bent 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
that has main jurisdiction over the issue in the senate has 
already said he probably will schedule a hearing merely to air the 
issues raised by opponents to the progressive financing nature of 
the catastrophic health expansion 
bentsen expressed confidence that whatever support may be 
emerging for redoing that portion of the bill will evaporate once 
the large majority of medicare beneficiaries not subject to the 
surcharge realize they are likely to either see their own premium 
payments go up or have benefits reduced 
house minority leader bob michel of illinois who signed on as a 
cosponsor said he reacted in response to so many people out 
there who have raised their voices about costs of the medicare 
expansion 
he said that at the very least discussion f the legislation 
should drive home the point that there is no magic wand you can 
wave here and have it all free

the tax court turned thumbs down tuesday on a 
minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for 11000 
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters 
william l mcreavy of minneapolis and his wife kathleen 
claimed the receptions as an advertisingentertainment expense 
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or 
referral sources for his washburnmcreavy funeral chapels inc 
the personal element of the expenses for the mcreavys 
daughters weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a 
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation 
could not deduct them the court held 
the court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the 
internal revenue service to add a negligence penalty to the 
mcreavys bill

the senate foreign relations committee on 
tuesday delayed a vote on the nomination of john negroponte to be 
ambassador to mexico because of questions raised about his part in 
the irancontra affair 
the panel also voted to postpone a vote on the nomination of 
joseph verner reed as chief of protocol for the white house 
sen jesse helms rnc blocked the vote because reed wrote a 
letter last year to former secretary of state george shultz asking 
that plo chief yasser arafat be allowed to address the united 
nations said a congressional source reed wrote the letter in his 
capacity as a un undersecretary after shultz denied arafat a visa 
to come to new york 
three ambassadors were approved by the panel including michael 
armacost as ambassador to japan james lilley as ambassador to 
china and terence a todman as ambassador to argentina the 
nominations must now be approved by the full senate 
postponement of the a vote on negroponte was requested by sen 
claiborne pell dri the chairman so he could review classified 
answers provided by the nominee late monday regarding his role in 
the plane to aid the antinicaraguan contras said the source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the committee had asked negroponte to explain the messages he 
conveyed to the honduran goverment in 1985 when he served there as 
ambassador the message involved continued support for the contras 
at a time when congress had banned us military aid to the rebels 
negroponte denied at his confirmation hearing that the message 
he was asked to relay offered honduras accelerated us economic 
and military aid in return for its support of the contras 
documents which have surfaced at the trial of former white house 
aide oliver north suggest such a quid pro quo may have been offered 
to the hondurans by george bush when he served as vice president 
but negroponte who was present at bushs meeting with honduran 
president roberto suazo in march 1985 has denied there was any 
talk of a swap

oliver north was portrayed to his trial jury 
tuesday as a liar who couldnt stop and as the joe isuzu of 
government who followed hitlers maxim that the victor will 
never be asked if he told the truth 
said prosecutor john keker in final arguments at norths trial 
if ollie north wanted to get it done he didnt care if he broke 
the law 
but in return defense lawyer brendan sullivan said anyone 
who links colonel north to adolf hitler is not credible and 
should not be believed he called the comparison outrageous 
this man is not adolf hitler sullivan said and he 
doesnt do things like adolf hitler 
the defense lawyer was scornful of his opponents saying 
everything the government sees north as doing is through a dirty 
glass 
why shouldnt north have thrown papers away he asked when they 
referred to the secret operations of the government 
in this case sullivan told the jury the government is 
off track and running wild and you should stop it 
north the former national security council aide who was at the 
center of the irancontra vortex sat stonefaced at the defense 
table as prosecutor keker methodically tried to dismantle his 
americanhero image 
telling the truth is something you learned at your mothers 
knee keker said government by deception is not a free 
government government by deception is not a democratic government 
government by deception is not a government under the rule of law 
after norths lawyer finishes his closing argument wednesday 
there will be rebuttal and then the trial now in its 12th week 
will go to the jury which will then be sequestered 
prosecutor keker told the jurors tuesday i will be asking you 
to return a verdict of guilty as to each of these 12 counts against 
oliver north 
he said the tragedy of oliver north is of a man who cared so 
much for freedom in nicaragua but forgot about the demands of 
freedom and democracy here at home 
if convicted on all counts the maximum penalty for north could 
be 60 years in prison 
the charges include six counts of lying to congress and 
withholding information obstructing a presidential inquiry and 
making false statements to investigators altering shredding and 
concealing documents receiving an illegal gratuity a security 
system at his home stealing money from a irancontra account and 
conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service 
the charges focus on an alleged attempt to cover up various 
aspects of a secret reagan administration operation to aid the 
nicaraguan rebels 
standing behind a portable lectern and using a huge chart that 
outlined the charges keker contended that north a highly 
decorated former marine officer and white house aide had a defense 
of the devil made me do it 
north blames other people mcfarlane made me to it casey 
told me to do it the prosecutor said robert mcfarlane was the 
national security adviser at the time of some of the alleged 
offenses and william casey was cia director 
in time a good man turned into a bad man said keker in a 
low unemotional voice once lying becomes a habit its hard to 
stop he put his hand on the bible and swore to tell the truth 
he said when north was questioned in november 1986 by the 
attorney general and aides about the diversion of iranian arms 
sales profits to the contras they thought he was telling the 
truth 
but said keker he was by this time the joe isuzu of 
government isuzu is a character in an automobile television 
commercial who tells lie upon lie 
in august 1985 when two congressmen sent letters asking for 
information about norths activities mcfarlane and north gave 
false answers keker said north said he supplied the answers at 
mcfarlanes direction 
north and mcfarlane were following adolf hitlers old 
strategy which is the victor will never be asked if he told the 
truth keker said if the lies work congress will stop asking 
questions 
keker said north did not hesitate to abuse his power by 
saying this is the white house calling whether the call was 
to cabinet officials or a car dealer 
that reference was to testimony last week focusing on norths 
purchase of a used 8000 gmc suburban north told the jury that he 
paid for the vehicle with cash he kept in a metal box at home the 
prosecutor suggested that irancontra codefendant richard secord 
helped pay for it 
he lied about that tin box because he knew that we knew that 
he had paid cash for his car in october 1985 and he couldnt 
explain how he got the cash for the car so he made up a story 
about the tin box keker charged 
the irancontra operational fund under norths control contained 
as much as 300000 keker said not even a saint could avoid 
being tempted by 300000 in liquid untraceable funds he added 
and oliver north is no saint 
the government noted that norths daughter got a horse for 
7000 in september 1986 and intimated the money came from that 
fund but sullivan said north sold one of the two houses he owned 
in 1986 easing his money burdens 
sullivan painted north as a slighted hero 
he faced machine gun fire like a wall of death sullivan 
said if you listen to the government youd believe colonel 
north went to work every day and decided what kind of crime to 
commit in which meeting 
speaking of kekers hitler line sullivan told the jury it is 
outrageous it should send a course of rage through all of you 
sullivan told the jurors that they stand between a citizen and a 
government and in this case the government is off track running 
wild 
he said the case is the government blaming ollie north for 
everything 
colonel north is about four rungs down in authority 
sullivan said at one point 
dealing with the attorney generals questioning of north after 
the irancontra link became public he asked why didnt he 
edwin meese iii go to the president hes the one who gave the 
authority for shipping missiles who signed the finding 
authorizing the shipment why ask ollie north why not ask the 
president

president bush on tuesday signed into law a 
498 million package of nonmilitary aid to sustain the contra 
rebels until nicaragua holds elections early next year 
bush reiterated his pledge to support a diplomatic solution in 
nicaragua and repeated his call for the soviet union to advance the 
peace process by ending its military aid to nicaraguas leftist 
government 
the soviet union must match its rhetorical support for the 
peace process with concrete action to halt military aid to end 
subversion in that region and to promote genuine democracy in 
nicaragua bush said 
administration officials have stated they want to see positive 
action in that vein by the soviet union and that it could result 
in a more favorable economic or trade stance toward the soviets by 
the united states 
officials estimate the soviet union provides about 500 million 
a year to nicaragua in military aid and about the same amount in 
economic aid 
a top state department official meanwhile said he had warned 
the contras that they risk a cutoff of the new aid unless they 
expel a commander convicted of human rights abuses 
legally we would have the basis to halt the aid said chris 
arcos deputy assistant secretary of state 
he said the contra military tribunal last month had convicted a 
commander known by the nom de guerre commandante mack but that the 
leader was seen in the contra camps subsequent to the time he 
should have been expelled 
arcos said he has been assured by the contra leadership that 
they expel those convicted of human rights abuses but that he was 
trying to find out if that had occurred with commandante mack 
in brief remarks in a rose garden ceremony before he signed the 
compromise legislation his administration worked out with congress 
bush threw the ball to nicaraguas sandinista government 
the success of the central american peace process and the 
prospects of national reconciliation in nicaragua depend on full 
and honest sandinista compliance with their repeated pledges of 
democracy and freedom 
its clear that close international scrutiny and sustained 
pressure will be critical to induce sandinista compliance 
the new aid package was worked out on march 24 after lengthy 
negotiations between administration officials and congresssional 
leaders 
bush was joined at the signing by democratic and republican 
leaders of the house and senate 
the compromise represented a major breakthrough in us policy 
toward central america following years of conflicting actions 
bushs agreement to forgo military aid in favor of a diplomatic 
approach was a break with the reagan administrations unrelenting 
push for military support for the rebels 
the package calls for humanitarian assistance to provide 
nonlethal aid to the rebels until the nicaraguan elections 
scheduled for next february 
the money also could be used to repatriate the contras under 
conditions considered politically acceptable for their return 
the bush administration is pushing for establishment of 
democratic reforms by the sandinistas as part of those conditions 
weve yet to see genuine sandinista compliance bush said 
tuesday thus far theyve refused to negotiate with the 
opposition regarding the necessary conditions for fair elections 
he added 
the aid money will go through the state departments agency for 
international development program cutting out any involvment by 
the cia which has sometimes posed a sticking point in past 
congressional debates on the contra issue 
the package also includes 42 million through aid to be 
administered by the catholic church in nicaragua in medical 
assistance for civilian victims of the civil war 
the contras an army estimated at about 11000 fighters are 
encamped along the honduran border although the military aid 
needed to keep them at war has been discontinued by congress they 
have been kept alive with us food and humanitarian assistance

sure workers showed up monday morning he would have the troops 
withdrawn and the curfew lifted 
the videotape showed shevardnadze listening passively as about a 
dozen members of the academy lambasted the local government for the 
way it handled the demonstration they charged that soldiers used 
spades to brutally beat protesters and chased them for blocks 
after they were dispersed 
vakhtan petriya a physician who initially treated victims of 
the clashes said three persons taken in were poisoned by 
aerosols 
he said soldiers used a nerve gas contained in canisters and 
aerosol containers we were at a loss on how to treat them he 
said i dont know the compound used in the gas shevardnadze 
did not respond 
another member of the academy who did not identify himself when 
he spoke directed his remarks directly to shevardnadze they 
actually hurt people by using sharp spades and knives he said 
i would like to tell you about that bluntly eduard 
one speaker described how soldiers after dispersing the 
protesters chased a young girl for several blocks then up two 
flights of stairs in the intourist hotel where she was beaten 
other speakers accused the government of attempting to use the 
media to cover up the actions of soldiers during the clashes our 
mass media especially television produced programs that were 
incompetent said a teacher of literature at tbilisi university 
who did not give his name 
a halftruth is worse than a falsehood he said this 
causes speculation this is a knife in the back of perestroika and 
democratization 
when shevardnadze addressed the academy he made no attempt to 
rebut the allegations of brutality and use of gas to disperse the 
protesters charges made last week by residents in telephone 
interviews with western reporters 
instead he urged georgians not to let the events of april 9 
stand in the way of restructuring the country he said they should 
develop perestroika without bloodshed and barricades 
in response to a question from the audience he said the order 
to deploy troops against the demonstrators came from the local 
communist party leadership and not from president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
if that was true i would not be standing before you now he 
said adding that he was sent to georgia by gorbachev to calm the 
situation 
shevardnadze denied there was censorship or attempts to muzzle 
the soviet press in covering the 10 days of military patrols and 
curfew foreign journalists have been barred from traveling to 
tbilisi and the soviet national press has offered little 
information on the clash itself

prime minister margaret thatcher opened a 
35nation conference on press freedom and the flow of information 
between east and west tuesday by declaring that europe will stay 
divided until all its peoples can mingle and talk freely 
in her address mrs thatcher defended her controversial ban 
last year on british radio and television interviews with members 
of the irish republican army as an antiterrorist measure 
but she said britain could not ban the satanic verses a 
novel that many moslems regard as blasphemous because the british 
author salman rushdie broke none of our laws 
foreign minister francisco fernandezordonez of spain spoke on 
behalf of the european community 
he said that despite 14 years of negotiations between western 
and communist countries anachronistic but real obstacles still 
impede the flow of information and working conditions for 
journalists are still not what they ought to be 
the monthlong conference called the information forum is an 
offshoot of the eastwest conference on security and cooperation in 
europe that conference ended this year in vienna with the 35 
participating nations promising to improve the flow of information 
including pledging greater freedom for their national media and for 
foreign correspondents 
the vienna conference was the second stage of negotiations that 
began in helskini in the 1970s 
nations taking part include every european country except 
albania the united states and canada 
east germany the only communist country to speak at the 
conference tuesday accused unspecified western journalists and 
news organizations of spreading disinformation 
only information the truth of which is established rather 
than speculation is spread in east germany said the 
delegation chief ambassador hans voss 
news agency reports of doubtful content or dubious origins 
have no place in the media of the german democratic republic 
as mrs thatcher opened the conference her officials announced 
she will visit the soviet union next year soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev visited britain this month 
he gorbachev told us of the progress of perestroika 
restructuring in the soviet union said mrs thatcher we 
welcome and support his reforms as well as the remarkable 
political change taking place in poland and hungary 
there is still a way to go she said adding there will only 
be a common european home if the occupants can mingle and talk 
freely 
she said the vienna talks had estalished the principle that 
any country is entitled to enquire about check and question the 
policies of others in the field of human rights and freedoms 
the commitments are not on a pick and choose basis trust 
is impossible when the promises we make to each other as well as to 
our own peoples are broken

the timetable for removing south 
african troops from namibia will be abandoned unless all black 
nationalist guerrillas withdraw to angola soon foreign minister 
pik botha said tuesday 
botha said the un plan to bring independence to namibia still 
is on schedule despite heavy fighting this month when guerrillas 
of the southwest africa peoples organization crossed into namibia 
from angola 
but the timetable will be disrupted if guerrillas still in the 
territory do not leave by months end botha said 
south africa claims 1600 guerrillas entered namibia also known 
as southwest africa after april 1 in violation of an agreement 
they would remain in angola at least until midmay 
according to south africa 278 guerrillas have been killed and 
28 captured about 380 have returned to angola and about 900 
remain in namibia swapo says the numbers are much lower 
botha said his troops will not return to their bases or withdraw 
to south africa as called for in the un plan until a total 
swapo withdrawal is verified 
south africa does not disclose its troop strength in namibia 
but it is supposed to have no more than 12000 soldiers there by 
may 14 
in windhoek the namibian capital territorial officials said 
un personnel escorted three swapo guerrillas into angola tuesday 
the three were among only seven guerrillas who have turned 
themselves in at un assembly points to be sent to angola the 
officials said the four others remained in namibia 
tuesdays transfer was the first by un forces since the 
assembly points were established last week in northern namibia 
the territorial officials also reported a landmine explosion 
damaged an army truck monday in the northern namibia they said no 
one was injured by the blast which they blamed on swapo 
at a news briefing botha expressed annoyance at reports that 
security forces acted callously in disposing of bodies of slain 
guerrillas he said such reports diverted attention from swapos 
responsibility for the combat 
armed forces chief gen jannie geldenhuys said his troops had 
firm instructions not to bury enemy bodies in mass graves but he 
said relatively inexperienced policemen did so when suddenly 
confronted with large numbers of dead in blistering heat 
by tuesday only seven guerrillas had reported to un 
checkpoints established to give the insurgents safe passage back to 
angola the others who have withdrawn did so on their own 
south african un and local community officials have predicted 
few guerrillas will venture near the assembly points because of 
heavy concentrations of south africanled police and soldiers 
around each area 
un police monitors are to be deployed in northern namibia this 
week and their superiors have urged residents to report any 
incidents of harassment or brutality there have been numerous 
allegations that security forces have been mistreating swapo 
supporters 
south africa has ruled the mineralrich territory since world 
war i in december it agreed to allow independence in exchange for 
cuba withdrawing its estimated 50000 troops from angola 
swapo has been fighting south african rule since 1966 and is 
favored to win most votes in independence elections scheduled for 
november

the giant bronze statue of freedom on top of 
the capitol dome is so badly deteriorated after 125 years that it 
will be removed probably by helicopter brought to the ground 
and restored the architect of the capitol said on tuesday 
architect george white made the disclosure at a ceremony 
launching a multimillion dollar fund raising effort to provide 
privatesector dollars to finance restoration projects at the 
capitol and to create a fund to buy art works associated with its 
past 
white said the first projects will be the restoration of the 
statue formally titled armed freedom and the installation of 
marble fountains on the capitols east plaza ending its use as a 
parking lot 
he estimated the cost at 300000 to 400000 but said that the 
paving of the entire plaza in patterned stone will likely cost more 
than 6 million 
the statue which weighs 14985 pounds rises 19 feet six inches 
from the top of the dome it was hoisted into position and bolted 
into place on dec 2 1863 
it hasnt been touched since white said when we had the 
dome repainted last summer we confirmed that the statue is in vary 
serious condition 
he said that cracks had developed in some of the interior 
fastenings of the statue and that an exterior piece of the staues 
flowing robes had fallen out the statue consists of five separate 
pieces of cast bronze bolted together and attached to a castiron 
base 
the whole thing is in really bad condition white said 
bronze does deteriorate 
in preparation for removing the statue a protective cage will be 
built around it white said and added 
well probably take it down by helicopter 
white estimated the cost of the project at 250000 but added 
it could cost a lot more depending on how serious the damage is 
when we get it down and are able to examine more closely

the bush administration told congress on 
tuesday it wants to preserve the right to control entry to the 
united states of anyone who was ever a communist 
the stance was spelled out in a letter to rep barney frank 
dmass who has led a sixyear fight to change the current law and 
limit the power of the government to keep out visitors from abroad 
the national education association a private group distributed 
a letter to congress in support of franks bill it said the 
present law has been used to keep out primo levi the italian 
chemist and novelist colombian novelist gabriel garcia marquez and 
mexican novelist carlos fuentes 
the letter from the administration signed in the name of joe d 
whitley acting associate attorney general said unless our 
reservations are addresssed the department cannot support the 
enactment of this proposed legislation 
he asked for changes to franks bill that would permit the 
attorney general to set conditions for the visit to the united 
states of anyone who has ever belonged to a communist party or to 
one of its affiliates 
frank criticized the justice department which he said had 
refused to discuss his bill with him and then had sent its 
ninepage letter of objections only on the morning of the session 
he said he may agree with some of the objections but would not 
discuss them at tuesdays session 
meanwhile the judiciary committees immigration subcommittee 
rejected 73 an effort to amend franks bill in such a way as to 
preserve the administrations right to control the visits of 
present and former communists rep lamar s smith rtexas is 
expected to propose the amendment again as the bill goes through 
later stages in the house 
i too am a supporter of free speech smith told the 
subcommittee however our countrys national security should 
never be jeopardized for free speech 
smith was opposed by rep hamilton fish jr rny who joined 
the democrats in voting against the amendment 
the exclusion of communists is out of date fish said in an 
interview after the session 
there are different kinds of communists in different 
countries some would be people we wouldnt want as visitors 
others would be acceptable an italian communist for example is 
different from many others he said 
rep bruce a morrison dconn chairman of the subcommittee 
ridiculed smiths proposal 
with that amendment in force george washington would never 
have been able to get back in if he had left the country 
morrison said it would exclude anyone with revolutionary ideas

three bank robbers committed 
suicide and a fourth surrendered after their hostage escaped from a 
plane used in a getaway attempt officials in northeastern brazil 
said tuesday 
a fifth robber committed suicide saturday a day after the drama 
began police said officials said the robbers had made a pact to 
commit suicide if their crime failed 
the episode that ended monday night at valdecaes airport in 
the amazon river city of belem began friday when five gunmen tried 
to rob a bank in acu 1860 miles northwest of rio authorities 
said 
when police arrived the gunmen took five hostages and demanded 
a plane and pilots to make their escape with 24674 in cash 
police gave them a brazilianmade 19seat bandeirantes and the 
robbers released all their hostages except one 
the subsequent chase covered more than 1200 miles across 
northern brazil 
on saturday the robbers and their hostage flew to belem 2140 
miles northwest of rio where they released the pilot and copilot 
when negotiations with police stalled one of the robbers shot 
himself his body was left on the runway and taken to a morgue 
on monday the roman catholic archbiship of belem the most 
rev alberto ramos met with the robbers and offered to take the 
place of fonseca as hostage the gunmen refused 
police said hostage hudson fonseca manager of the northeastern 
bank of brazil in acu slipped away from his captors monday night 
the robbers had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate for a new 
aircraft to replace the plane they were given earlier authorities 
said 
they were exhausted and desperate federal police 
spokeswoman myrtes nabuco de oliveira pontes said by telephone 
when the police refused to meet their demands for a new plane 
they began tearing the aircraft apart 
teams of police sharpshooters surrounded the commuter plane 
which was parked on a landing strip 
however three robbers came down the planes stairway pointing 
pistols at their own heads shortly after the hostage escaped and 
shot themselves without warning federal police agent fernando 
cesar said 
a suspect remaining in the plane then called out for a 
cigarette which a police officer outside offered to him the agent 
said when the suspect came out for it authorities grabbed him and

the city is considering a plan to put 
alarms or exploding dye packs inside its parking meters to stop 
vandals who have smashed or stolen half of them in the past nine 
months officials said tuesday 
merchants are angry because motorists ignore parking 
restrictions when the meters dont work and customers are 
discouraged by fewer open parking spaces 
this meter problem is a really frustrating situation thats 
costing the city a lot of money and whats odd is that the thieves 
are not getting much for their efforts said public works 
director terry roberts 
vandals who bash or steal the meters can hope at best to get 20 
for their efforts in many cases they get only a few dollars or a 
few cents if they cant pry open the vaultlike coin containers 
roberts said 
but more than 4000 of the citys 8500 parking meters have been 
bashed in broken open or ripped right out of the ground and carted 
off police find the twisted metal carcasses strewn under freeway 
underpasses and in parks 
it seems people popped a few tops off the meters some months 
ago and found it was easier than they thought and of course the 
word spread roberts said 
about 75 people have been arrested in the parking meter 
bashings police have vowed to seek felony theft charges in as many 
cases as possible said lt larry eade 
weve arrested people who have filled up shopping carts with 
the meters then covered them up with their belongings eade said 
the city with a population of about 350000 has lost about 
450000 in revenue because of damaged meters it will cost 
840000 to replace 7000 of the old meters with a 120 
tamperresistant version officials said 
some of the new heavyduty meters are in place but they are 
not immune to vandalism either 
thieves sometimes rip out the new machines take them to 
secluded locations and bash them open police said 
the city plans to allocate 12000 for overtime to fund an 
undercover police squad looking into the problem and may put 
alarms or exploding colored dye packs in meters said yvonne 
garcia chief of staff to mayor lionel wilson 
if these people are causing all these problems just for a few 
nickles and dimes i think theyve got to be pretty stupid said 
al federas of lake shore travel one of the merchants who 
complained about the thefts

a scientist said tuesday a controlled 
simultaneous test of a university of utah chemists claim to have 
achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water proved the energy 
produced did not come from a chemical reaction 
robert huggins stanford university professor of material 
sciences said his experiment using palladium electrodes in jars of 
heavy water and plain water in a picnic basket produced energy that 
may have resulted from fusion 
huggins said he cant be sure the energy is from fusion but is 
certain it is not from a chemical reaction as some other 
scientists have speculated he suggested the energy may result from 
a different type of fusion than is commonly known 
he said he ran five experiments over two weeks using a jar of 
heavy water or deuterium oxide and a jar of plain water if the 
experiments produced the same results he said it would indicate 
the energy was not from fusion 
instead he found much higher temperatures from the deuterium 
which meant the energy probably was not a chemical reaction because 
there is no essential chemical difference between the two kinds of 
water 
there are significant thermal differences between the 
deuterium and the hydrogen plain water system he said we 
dont say what it is 
the discovery of cold fusion was announced march 23 by 
university of utah chemistry professor stanley pons and british 
colleague martin fleischmann 
pons who said monday further experiments with heavy water and a 
palladum electrode yielded even more energy and run more 
efficiently noted the apparent cold fusion discovery had been 
partly verified by more than 60 university and private laboratories 
of the more than 60 other experimenters pons said none has 
reported observing both the production of neutrons and the high 
level of heat he and fleischmann produced 
neutrons are a telltale sign of fusion the process powering 
the sun in which tremendous amounts of energy are released when 
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse 
scientists say that if fusion can be created as easily as pons 
and fleischmann claim it could be a relatively inexpensive and 
virtually inexhaustible energy source

gregg who has not said whether he will sign it gregg has said he 
personally opposes abortion 
the laws have not been enforced since the 1973 us supreme 
court ruling legalizing abortion 
the swing vote in the senate was democrat james st jean who 
said abortion is a decision for a woman to make in accordance with 
her own religious beliefs 
fourteen other states have old antiabortion laws on the books 
that are unenforceable because of the roe vs wade decision but 
there has been debate over whether they could take effect if the 
high court overturned the decision 
the states are alabama arizona arkansas connecticut 
delaware idaho illinois louisiana michigan mississippi 
oklahoma south dakota west virginia and wisconsin 
the supreme court plans to hear arguments april 26 in a key 
abortionrights case from missouri in which the justices are being 
asked to overturn or substantially limit their landmark 1973 
decision

italian scientists announced tuesday they achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature with a different process than 
other recent cold fusion experiments have used 
they cautioned it was too soon to tell if their process would 
prove practical for generating energy 
the scientists said recent experients at the national agency for 
alternative energy in frascati just outside of rome produced 
large emissions of neutrons but too little energy to register 
emissions of neutrons particles of an atom are evidence of 
fusion 
fusion the process that powers the sun produces energy when 
the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse in contrast conventional 
nuclear power plants use fission which is the splitting of atoms 
scientists have long searched for a way to harness nuclear 
fusion standard experiments have used extremely high temperatures 
last month an american and a british researcher said they 
produced fusion at room temperature 
but unlike that work the new italian experiments did not use 
electrical current to trigger the reaction and they did not use 
heavy water which contains a heavy version of hydrogen called 
deuterium 
the experiment is totally different from former ones said 
umberto colombo head of the national agency for alternative 
energy we have paved the way for a new road to fusion research 
what we dont know yet is if the energy generated is sufficient to 
justify practical application 
if this experiment were not of such great importance to the 
public we would never have announced the discovery at this 
point said professor francesco scaramuzzi 60 who performed the 
experiments we are still in a very preliminary phase 
scaramuzzi said that on two occasions they measured high 
emissions of neutrons after placing a sample of the element 
titanium and deuterium gas in a special metal tube and subjecting 
it to various pressures and temperatures 
the neutrons appeared in one case after applying high pressure 
and low temperature and in another at low pressure and room 
temperature 
the agency decided to begin the experiments after stanley pons 
of the university of utah and martin fleischmann of the university 
of southampton in england announced on march 23 that they achieved 
nuclear fusion at room temperature 
pons and fleischmann said their experiment using common lab 
equipment had been run for more than 100 hours and produced four 
times as much energy as it used in a similar experiment 
researcher steven jones of brigham young university in utah found 
evidence of only very low energy output 
on monday pons told a news conference in salt lake city that 
more than 60 university and private laboratories partly verified 
the claims he made last month with fleischmann 
he also said further experiments yielded even more energy and 
ran more efficiently he said a controlled fusion reaction has been 
sustained more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy 
water and a palladium electrode and that recent tests produced 
roughly eight times the energy consumed 
pons said researchers measured the production of 20 to 30 watts 
of electricity from the experiment or about 67 watts per cubic 
centimeter of electrode compred to 26 watts per cubic centimeter 
in the earlier experiments 
those experiments used electrolysis in which an electrical 
current was used to herd hydrogen atoms into metal electrodes 
where the atoms were apparently forced to fuse because of proximity 
scaramuzzi told a news conference after steven jones 
experiment i asked myself how important is electrolysis there 
must be more than one road to fusion 
scaramuzzi said that the energy output of his experiment at this 
scale was too low to be registered 
in a separate development the official czechoslovak news agency 
ctk said tuesday that a team of czechoslovak physicists also 
produced roomtemperature fusion through the electrolysis method 
pavol povinc who led the team of scientists from the comenius 
universitys faculty of mathematics in bratislava capital of 
slovakia announced they had achieved fusion on monday

the interior department announced a joint 6 
million threeyear research program with the petroleum industry 
tuesday to develop better recovery and cleanup equipment and 
methods for large oil spills 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr said the department would 
pay for half of the program with the american petroleum institute 
paying for the other half the departments current budget for such 
research is less than 150000 
in the wake of the exxon valdez accident we must make sure 
that our oil spill contingency plans are thoroughly reexamined to 
meet our responsibility for protecting the environment said 
lujan 
he made the announcement after meeting for about 20 minutes with 
richard marro chairman of amoco and chairman of the american 
petroleum institute and with charles dibona president of the 
industry organization 
lujan said he was flying to alaska on wednesday for a fourday 
tour of areas affected by the march 24 spill from the exxon tanker 
that has caused environmental havoc in prince william sound and 
along alaskas southern coastline 
meanwhile the department said it was planning to step up 
inspections at offshore oil drilling platforms to check whether the 
industry is prepared to respond to an oil spill emergency a 
report on the inspections is to be presented to lujan late next 
month 
the 6 million research effort over three years is aimed at 
developing and field testing various methods and technology for 
dealing with massive spills lujan has described the containment 
equipment in alaska at the time of the exxon spill as little more 
than tinkertoys that would not have contained the spill even 
if it had been deployed rapidly 
in alaska said lujan oil containment booms frequently broke 
from the force of the waves and oil syphoning equipment was far too 
slow to do much good 
department officials said the joint interiorindustry study will 
involve laboratory and field testing of various oilburning 
techniques new highspeed steerable booms and more advanced 
skimmer technology for clearing oil from iceladen waters 
various chemicals some of which are supposed to disperse oil 
while others are designed to keep it together also will be tested 
under the program the officials said 
marro said that while the industry has conducted research into 
oil spill recovery technology for years there are lessons to be 
learned from the alaskan spill 
he suggested the industry still does not know all it should 
about how best to anticipate oil movement in a coldwater 
environment and for example once new equipment becomes available 
it remains unclear how it should be deployed

the house voted overwhelmingly tuesday to back 
a plan to close 86 military bases and scale back five more despite 
complaints that the move will not save as much as advocates had 
promised 
by a vote of 38143 the house rejected a resolution to 
disapprove the recommendations of the commission on base 
realignment and closure giving the green light for defense 
secretary dick cheney to follow through on the panels proposals 
beginning in january 
it is incumbent upon all of us to make sure this base closing 
list is implemented the chairman of the house armed services 
chairman rep les aspin dwis said moments before the vote 
the commissions recommendations affect a total of 145 domestic 
military installations by closing some reducing the operations of 
others and changing the missions of additional bases 
the law establishing the commission the base closure and 
realignment act requires that once approved by the secretary of 
defense the commissions recommendations proceed unless both 
houses of congress vote to disapprove them in which case none of 
the proposals would take effect 
the house action means the changes proposed by the commission 
will proceed 
in debate before the vote opponents of the move said it would 
not save as much money as the commission projected 
this list simply does not save money said rep jim saxton 
rnj 
he was jointed by representatives from illinois and california 
in saying that the plan would not save 694 million in the first 
year or 56 billion over 20 years as the commission projected 
in terms of savings i dont believe theyre there in terms 
of expenditures i believe thyre underestimated said saxton 
who opposes the closing of fort dix in his home state 
saxton cited a congressional report that said the savings in 
closing fort dix had been overestimated by 20 million 
the new jersey representative also noted that a report by the 
general accounting office an investigative arm of congress had 
found that the commission used incorrect data in its analysis of 
army training centers including fort dix 
had accurate data been used fort dix would hae been ranked 
first saxton said 
rep terry bruce dill said the estimated savings rely on 
major defense policy changes including reductions in personnel 
and not on the closing and realigning of bases 
the whole tone of the commission was based on manipulating 
data changing ratings fudging dollar figures and misleading both 
congress and the public bruce said 
all but a dozen of the votes for the resolution came from 
representatives from illinois california and new jersey among the 
plans supporters rep ronald machtley rri argued that it was 
time to get serious about deficit reduction 
obsolete bases have drained our resources the 
recommendations are the only viable option for cutting expenditures 
of funds he said 
rep pat schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed 
services committee said that although the gao had found some 
errors in the commissions work the bottom line was still the 
savings 
maybe we dont save as much money on some of the bases maybe 
we disagreed with the models that was used but they never said on 
one of these bases that it was going to cost money to close them if 
you look at it over a sixyear period schroeder said 
last month the armed services committee voted 434 to support 
the commission report 
schroeder also said that she and rep brian donnelly dmass 
will introduce legislation next week to close and realign bases 
overseas 
schroeder said that total basing costs overseas have increased 
nearly 500 percent since 1974 and that leaving those installations 
out of the domestic base closure bill was a glaring omission 
our allies have insisted on higher and higher payments for the 
permission to operate bases on their soil schroeder said in 
essence we are being forced to pay more for the privilege of 
defending our allies 2 billion a year up from 200 million in 
1974

the communist government said tuesday that 
president bushs economic aid plan for poland is a step in the 
right direction after years of restrictions and limitations 
but deputy government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski strongly 
disagreed with bushs assessment that communism is fading 
communism is not falling and we will try to prove this he 
told a news conference 
developments in poland which have made the us 
administration change its stance toward poland undeniably testify 
to the fact that we are moving forward and create new hopes 
bush on monday disclosed economic incentives to reward poland 
for steps toward democracy and to encourage further political and 
economic reforms 
the package included asking congress to lower tariffs on 
selected polish imports under the generalized system of 
preferences and seeking congressional approval of usguaranteed 
loans to stimulate private investment in poland 
bush also announced a new us willingness to work with other 
western financial leaders to help poland deal with its 38 billion 
foreign debt 
taken together the moves could work to polands economic 
advantage to the tune of more than 1 billion 
the polish government interprets this statement bushs as a 
step in the right direction after years of restrictions and 
limitations rykowski said 
he said poland would be able to evaluate the package fully on 
the basis of concrete results 
if fully implemented the us package would largely reverse 
economic sanctions taken against the government in 198182 after it 
imposed martial law and banned solidarity 
a warsaw court restored the independent trade unions legal 
status monday in accord with an agreement reached april 5 between 
communist authorities and the opposition on economic and political 
reform 
solidarity leader lech walesa praised bush for his action when 
he arrived in warsaw monday night from gdansk 
bush is a great man and he knows the polish situation very 
well walesa told reporters he called the us aid proposal 
quite large

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
met tuesday with communist party chief karoly grosz and hungary 
announced it has assumed a mediating role in the middle east 
shamirs sudden unannounced trip raised speculation in israel 
that the two countries were about to restore diplomatic ties 
hungary broke ties with israel during the 1967 middle east war 
shamir told the official mti news agency shortly before his 
departure that he hoped israel and hungary would establish normal 
diplomatic relations in the very near future 
but i cant give any definite date mti quoted him as saying 
hungarian officials did not disclose the purpose of shamirs 
twoday visit nor did they give details on his meeting with grosz 
however the state news agency mti quoted foreign ministry 
spokesman istvan komoroczki as saying hungary has agreed to act 
as a mediator and will try to persuade all parties concerned in the 
middle east crisis to sit down to the negotiating table 
israeli radio reports also said shamir was discussing an east 
bloc role in mideast peace efforts 
the reports did not elaborate but hungary may be taking over a 
role long attributed to president nicolae ceausescu of romania 
ceausescu leads the only east bloc country that did not sever 
relations with israel during the 1967 middle east war however 
many countries now shun romania because of its human rights record 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth has said he expects full 
diplomatic relations to be restored between hungary and israel by 
june 
hungary is seeking removal of trade barriers imposed by israel 
kovacs told mti the agency said the israelis have stressed they 
extend trade preferences only to countries with which they have 
full diplomatic ties

the soviet union has experienced at least three 
fatal stadium panics similar to the one that took 95 lives in 
england last weekend a soviet newspaper reported tuesday 
thousands of fans were allowed to enter an already crowded 
standingroom area of the sheffield stadium on saturday and 
spectators were trampled or crushed against a fence 
sovietsky sport said dozens of people died in moscows lenin 
stadium on oct 21 1982 during a game between spartak moscow and 
haarlem of holland it said cries of horror were heard when 
dozens of people died under the heels of thousands 
authorities would not say at the time whether anyone was killed 
or injured unofficial sources said a woman fell into a narrow 
passageway and people trying to help her were trampled by the crowd 
the article in sovietsky sport also said some boys died in a 
crush at a junior hockey match between the soviet union and canada 
in moscows sports palace in 1975 but did not say how many 
people also were killed in krasnoyarsk in siberia in 1982 at the

charles lewis an old friend of mayor marion 
barry has had dealings with a man arrested as part of a major drug 
crackdown in the nations capital according to sources familiar 
with an ongoing probe into the drug ring 
investigators have gathered information that lewis already 
under indictment on drug charges in separate cases in the district 
of columbia and the virgin islands has dealt with rayful edmond 
iii the alleged leader of a powerful local drug ring 
however lewis and edmond did not deal drugs together the 
sources said instead lewis may have purchased drugs from edmond 
or his partners when he traveled to washington on several occasions 
during the past year the sources said 
edmond 24 was arrested along with 16 other persons over the 
weekend in what us attorney jay b stephens called the most 
significant crackdown on illegal drugs ever in the city 
lewis was indicted last thursday on seven counts of perjury and 
three counts of cocaine possession stemming from an investigation 
into barrys visits to lewis hotel room last december 
lewis a former district of columbia and virgin islands 
government employee was charged with lying to a federal grand jury 
about whether he possessed cocaine on dec 22 on a day on which 
barry visited him lewis is also charged with lying about using 
cocaine with two separate individuals on dec 21 a day on which 
barry twice visited him 
the federal probe began after city police on dec 22 were 
inexplicably called off an attempt to make an undercover drug 
purchase from lewis 48 after barry showed up at his hotel room 
barry has acknowledged contacting police officials looking into the 
affair but has said he was only trying to speed up the probe 
lewis also went on trial monday in the virgin islands on charges 
he attempted to sell cocaine to undercover fbi agents during march 
stephens said edmonds cartel made up mostly of family members 
may have been responsible for up to 25 percent of the cocaine sold 
in washington as well as a number of drugrelated murders 
edmond and eight other accused members of the ring are being 
held without bond after hearings monday before a us magistrate 
seven other adults and a juvenile were also arrested on saturday in 
a sweep that followed a twoyear investigation 
stephens said the case remains open but wouldnt say if or when 
he expects to make more arrests

house speaker jim wright opening his defense 
against a string of ethics committee charges sought tuesday to 
rally democratic colleagues and told them i intend to fight and 
i intend to win 
he said that while he may have made mistakes in judgment i 
have never done anything to dishonor this institution and i never 
will at the same time democrats agonized over the political 
decision they face on whether to keep wright as speaker and one 
said it may be that the toughest political vote of our lives will 
be the one to save him 
in a halfhour speech to a private session of the democratic 
caucus in the house chamber and later in press releases wright 
chose to concentrate his defense on one issue the charge that his 
wife betty did no substantial work for the 72000 she received 
from a fort worth friend from 1980 to 1984 
but more troubling to many of his colleagues were charges that 
wright sought to evade house limits on outside earned income 
through seven bulk sales of his book reflections of a public 
man most of them made in lieu of accepting speaking fees from 
interest groups 
wright received a standing ovation at the end of his caucus 
speech which included an admission that he had made some errors in 
judgment and may have made some mistakes in my life according 
to participants 
he also told his fellow democrats who reelected him as speaker 
just four months ago that he did not want to continue to hold the 
post if he couldnt be an effective leader of the party according 
to one member present 
emerging from the chamber he told reporters i told them i 
intend to fight and i intend to win i told them i have never done 
anything to dishonor this insitution and i never will 
wrights lawyer william c oldaker was consulting with the 
ethics committee to arrange a speedy appearance for the speaker 
before the committee to answer the charges late tuesday the 
speaker sent a letter to the panel formally denying all counts 
against him 
rep john t myers of indiana the ranking republican on the 
ethics committee said while the panel would try to expedite 
matters in accord with wrights request it would be difficult to 
cut much time from the process without denying due process to 
either side he said it could take up to two months to bring 
wrights case to a disciplinary hearing 
following wrights speech most democratic house members 
interviewed voiced tentative support for the speaker many said 
they had not yet read the ethics committees voluminous report 
formally charging him with 69 instances of rules violations and 
added that they were waiting to see whether the panel takes all of 
those issues to a disciplinary hearing 
but they acknowledged that growing political heat from their 
home districts and what lawmakers hear when they go home for the 
long passover weekend would play a role in whether wright remains 
as speaker 
the recess will have some role because every member is 
undoubtedly aware that if we have to make difficult votes in 
defense of the speaker those will be used in 30second republican 
political ads against us in the next election said rep pat 
williams dmont 
the easy thing for democrats to do is to throw jim wright over 
the side and instantly install house majority leader tom foley 
behind the wheel williams said it may be that the toughest 
political vote of our lives will be the one to save him 
its not going to be about justice added rep ron dellums 
dcalif its going to be about how itll play in peoria 
rep timothy j penny dminn said he was most concerned about 
wrights book sales which the ethics panel charged were used as a 
ruse to circumvent the rule that caps outside earned income at 30 
percent of a members salary 
if theres a rigid interpretation of the rules hes ok 
penny said but if theres strong evidence they were trying to 
circumvent income limits thats a gray area 
penny said he did not attend wrights speech because he was 
uncomfortable with what he termed efforts by the democratic 
leadership to make the ethics case into a test of partisan loyalty 
were trying to make it us against them democrats against 
republicans thats not the nature of these ethics questions 
he said 
penny also said he believed there is a growing public perception 
of wrongdoing by wright which will cause political problems no 
matter how the case is resolved 
the committee could recommend no sanction and wright could 
still be under some pressure to step down he said 
theres been a slowdown and a morale loss said rep bill 
richardson dnm its a very bleak period ive been in 
congress seven years and ive never felt so bad and down about 
being a member of congress 
republicans meanwhile appeared to seek to turn up the heat on 
democrats holding a news conference to outline their own 
legislative agenda for the next two years and declaring its time 
for democrats to help govern or get out of the way 
we have to get by the blaring headlines quite frankly and 
get back to work said minority leader robert michel rill but 
michel and rep mickey edwards rokla denied they were seeking 
to capitalize on wrights problems 
wright was gathering affidavits from people in fort worth who 
said they had worked with his wife and observed what she did in 
return for her 18000ayear salary from real estate developer 
george mallick and the partnership the two couples formed known as 
mallightco 
he said she had researched investment opportunities in real 
estate and office building ventures in fort worth and new york and 
studied investments in a winery in the movie version of the 
musical annie and in oil ventures and stock purchases 
the fact is that my wife worked she earned her pay wright

the tax court turned thumbs down tuesday on a 
minnesota undertaker who took a business tax deduction for 11000 
of expenses of wedding receptions for two daughters 
william l mcreavy of minneapolis and his wife kathleen 
claimed the receptions as an advertisingentertainment expense 
contending that 82 percent of the people invited were clients or 
referral sources for his washburnmcreavy funeral chapels inc 
the personal element of the expenses for the mcreavys 
daughters weddings was so prominent that we believe that even a 
person not versed in the tax law would know that the corporation 
could not deduct them the court held 
the court was so unimpressed by the argument that it allowed the 
internal revenue service to add a negligence penalty to the

thousands of people attacked banks police 
stations and stores in a southern town tuesday to protest price 
increases imposed by the government witnesses reported 
one report said 25 people were injured before police restored 
order in maan a town of 25000 people 120 miles south of amman 
price increases are part of an agreement with the international 
monetary fund to reduce budget deficits as a step toward 
rescheduling much of the 6 billion debt 
king husseins government has promised to continue low 
subsidized prices for such staples as bread milk and rice a loaf 
of arabic flat bread costs less than 4 cents 
yousef azem a former member of parliament said the protest 
began among public transport drivers who went to schools and 
rallied students to demonstrate he estimated 3000 people were 
involved in the protests 
a merchant said it seemed like the whole town participated i 
heard people chanting slogans because of the price hikes and 
increases in rent they were chanting slogans against the 
government 
on sunday the government raiserd gasoline prices 25 percent to 
the equivalent of about 165 a gallon imposed an annual license 
fee of 370 on taxis and raised the fees for other vehicles prices 
of cigarettes cooking gas alcoholic beverages and telephone calls 
went up by 10 to 50 percent 
jordan imports most consumer goods and those prices have risen 
sharply because of a devaluation early last year that reduced 
exchange rate for the dinar from about 3 to 185 
many landlords also raised rents because of the devaluation but 
monthly wages equivalent to 185370 for most workers have not 
gone up the government also has cut overtime and other fringe 
benefits for public workers 
unemployment almost nonexistent five years ago has risen to 20 
percent by some estimates 
the crisis arose because of declines in jordans main sources of 
foreign exchange money sent home by jordanians living abroad and 
aid from arab nations 
azem said 25 protesters and policemen were injured tuesday in 
maan he said the crowd stoned or burned five banks and attacked 
two police posts and several government offices 
a hotel worker in maan said about six cars were smashed you 
can now see the traces of burned cars he reported seeing several 
banks stoned and a small fire set in the entrance of one 
officials in maan insisted it was only a small protest and 
denied any buildings had been attacked a few young men after 
leaving school before noontime burned tires and demonstrated but 
police stopped them peacefully said faheem nawayseh deputy

president bush on tuesday sent congress his 
proposal to add 374000 pregnant women and children to the medicaid 
program in an effort to reduce the nations high infant mortality 
rate 
infant and maternal care is an area where we must invest in 
the future bush said in a statement i am particularly 
disturbed by the fact that the infant mortality rate for black 
infants is nearly twice that for whites 
bush announced the outlines of the initiative in february as 
part of his fiscal 1990 budget he proposed medicaid spending of 
376 billion 33 billion or 96 percent more than this years 
budget for the federalstate health assistance program for the poor 
states would pick up the cost of the added coverage 
his plan would require state medicaid programs by april 1 
1990 to cover pregnant women and mothers with infants as long as 
their incomes are within 130 percent of the federal poverty line 
this would require coverage for a single pregnant woman with an 
income of up to 10426 a household of two with an income up to 
13078 a household of three 15730 and a household of four 
18382 
states have been moving toward a threshold of 100 percent of the 
poverty line that is required by current law to be reached by july 
1 1990 and they have the option of going to 185 percent that 
option would remain under bushs plan 
currently all but 10 states cover pregnant women and infants up 
to 1 year old at 100 percent of the poverty level or more ten 
states use a cutoff of more than 100 percent according to the 
health care financing administration which administers the 
medicaid program 
the presidents plan also would require states to improve 
participation in medicaid by running outreach programs in areas 
that have high infant mortality rates and to provide medicaid 
services to pregnant women who are presumed eligible before they go 
through a formal eligibility determination 
also under the program all children under 6 who receive food 
stamps would be covered by medicaid for immunizations 
bush also proposed spending 20 million in fiscal 1990 and 1991 
on a new program to improve coordination among three federal 
programs serving women and children medicaid maternal and child 
health and the women infants and children nutritional program 
the increases in medicaid coverage would be paid for by 
reductions in the federal matching rate for state administrative 
expenses the rates currently ranging from 75 percent to 100 
percent would be reduced gradually to a uniform 50 percent 
this legislation does not do all that we want to do but it 
does do what we can do at this time bush said 
public health officials have been concerned for some time that 
infant mortality rates in the united states have not been improving 
as fast as in other nations the united states dropped from 19th in 
1980 to 22nd in 1985 among nations in the world ranked by infant 
mortality rates 
in 1985 the infant mortality rate for white americans was 93 
deaths per 1000 births while it was 182 per 1000 for black 
americans

in a landmark decision 
tuesday a judge found four eskimos innocent of charges of public 
mischief arising from protests of lowlevel nato flights over their 
traditional hunting grounds 
i am satisfied that the four believe their ancestors predate 
any canadian claims to ancestry on this land judge james 
igloliorte told a makeshift courtroom set up in the community hall 
of this labrador village 
through their knowledge of ancestry and kinship they have 
shown that none of their people ever gave away rights to the land 
to canada 
daniel ashini chief of the local innu band of eskimos ben 
michel a band council member elizabeth penashue and her son 
peter penashue were accused of entering the runway area at the 
goose bay air base in september to protest the flights by canada 
west germany britain and the netherlands 
the provincial court judge himself an innu accepted defense 
arguments that the four held an honest belief that the land on 
which the airbase is located belongs to the eskimos and therefore 
they committed no wrong 
the judge urged a political settlement to the dispute between 
the ottawa government and the eskimos over the nato flights and 
simulated bombing runs the natives say have made a battleground of 
the territory they claim as a homeland 
igloliorte said the government must negotiate answers to their 
problems since the court is unable to answer these problems for 
them 
native leaders hailed the ruling as a victory the government 
gave no indication on whether it would appeal the decision 
after the verdict the four accused jumped to their feet and 
clapped as did the 150 eskimo men women and children who attended 
the threeday trial earlier this month 
the ruling calls on canada to enter into a new era of 
relations with the innu eskimo said a beaming ashini the era 
of extinction of rights through an unjust land claims process is 
over 
james oreilly a native affairs lawyer termed the judgment a 
significant victory for the native people of canada 
the fact that the judge would recognize traditional rights 
as being sufficient to override arguments of national defense is 
certainly a first as far as i can see he said in an interview 
from montreal

a congressman investigating the commodity 
futures trading commission on tuesday criticized as insufficient 
the background checks done on prospective employees of the 
exchanges 
as far as people with criminal records i dont think there 
is any question that those people are likely to be identified 
through the fingerprint system said rep glenn english dokla 
its the socalled white collar crime we very likely we could 
have people who were released from a job without being 
prosecuted he said 
english chairs the house agriculture subcommittee on 
conservation credit and rural development which is to find out 
whether changes should be made in the cftc before congress votes to 
reauthorize it 
its the cftcs job to police the commodity futures exchanges 
in the wake of a twoyear fbi undercover probe of the chicago 
mercantile exchange and the chicago board of trade members of 
congress have been wondering if the cftc has been doing its job 
our purpose is to identify weak spots in the system said 
english as far as background checks that is one weakness we 
found today 
englishs comments followed a briefing by congressional 
investigators who have been looking into the operations of the cftc 
it was the first in a series of briefings that will be conducted 
before cftc reauthorization hearings are held 
staff investigators told the subcommittee that hiring policies 
on the exchanges vary 
no background checks are conducted at the kansas city board of 
trade the minneapolis grain exchange and the philadelphia board of 
trade said james mcdonald a subcommittee staff member 
each of the three exchanges indicated they conducted an 
interview and checked with the references he said 
the chicago mercantile exchange investigates driving records 
credit history and previous criminal convictions and verifies 
addresses and social security numbers before hiring anyone into 
management accounting finance and administration or the 
purchasing and security departments 
hiring at the chicago board of trade is similar said 
congressional staff member gwenetta blackwell though she noted the 
personnel department there does not check for prior criminal 
records during its background investigations 
neither exchange has a prohibition against hiring someone with a 
criminal record though if the information is known it would not be 
disregarded she said 
to be registered with the national futures association a person 
must be fingerprinted and undergo a name check with the 
securities and exchange commission to determine whether there is 
record of any past disciplinary record in the securities industry 
nfa does not investigate the individuals employment and 
educational history or credit standing and life style as is done 
for security clearance investigations said david tarosky 
organizations which must register through the nfa include 
futures commissions merchants introducing brokers commodity pool 
operators commodity trading advisors associated persons and floor 
brokers 
in upcoming weeks the subcommittee will be briefed on 
compliance and disciplinary actions trading practices including 
dual trading sales practices reparations and arbitrations 
clearing houses and the status of audit trails and trade timing 
with information on technological advances

the pentagon is considering the elimination of 
both nuclearpowered attack submarines from the 1990 budget two 
congressmen said tuesday 
reps john g rowland rconn and herbert h bateman rva 
said they have learned that defense department officials were 
taking a serious look at eliminating the ssn688 attack submarines 
which are the last two of the los angeles class series the pentagon 
planned to order 
the proposal was revealed at a house armed services seapower 
subcommittee hearing during which the lawmakers urged navy 
officials to fight to keep the submarines the congressmen 
represent the home states of the two manufacturers of the los 
angelesclass subs the electric boat division of general dynamics 
corp in groton conn and the newport news va shipbuilding co 
vice adm william d smith deputy chief of naval operations 
pledged his support for the submarines he noted that elimination 
of the submarines would mean that this would be the first year the 
united states had not ordered an attack submarine since 1953 
defense secretary dick cheney is expected to annouce next week 
plans to cut 64 billion from the 1990 budget proposed by 
president reagan elimination of the two los angeles class subs 
would save about 15 billion 
in an interview after the hearing rowland said proponents of 
the submarine cuts inside the pentagon are arguing the subs are 
expendable since they are the last in the los angelesclass series 
the navy ordered its first ssn21 seawolf submarine which will 
replace the los angelesclass subs last year from electric boat 
no seawolfs were included in the 1990 budget but two are expected 
to be purchased the following fiscal year 
rowland and bateman argued that the united states cannot afford 
to eliminate two attack submarines in light of advances in soviet 
submarine technology and production 
the news of the possible sub cuts came as navy officials 
defended the pentagons submarine program and its antisubmarine 
warfare technology which have come under intense scrutiny since an 
indepenent study last month warned that recent major advances in 
submarine quieting by the soviets have rendered traditional 
detection methods close to obsolete 
following the hearing rowland sent a telegram to cheney urging 
him to retain the los angeles class submarines 
these two 688 submarines are stateofart and are needed to 
assure us qualitative superiority over soviet submarines force 
cutting two 688s from budget makes little sense in view of soviet 
antisubmarine warfare advances rowland wrote

some of the crack cocaine sold on 
broward county streets was processed not in dark labs in 
crimeridden neighborhoods but on the seventh floor of the county 
courthouse 
the sheriffs office has been turning cocaine into the purified 
smokable form because it cant get enough to supply undercover 
officers setting up street sweeps to arrest buyers 
defense attorneys say that at best the sheriffs office is 
ethically wrong to make crack also known as rock 
a spokesman for broward sheriff nick navarro who seems to 
thrive on publicity and controversy said tuesday the sheriff was 
pleased with the operations results 
with all this publicity i suppose all the attorneys will be 
keenly aware of it said spokesman jim leljedal we believe our 
cases will stand up 
although the sheriffs office had believed it was the first in 
the nation to make its own crack the polk county sheriffs 
department last june produced 11 ounces of crack cocaine for 
undercover use 
ive never heard of that in my whole life before said con 
dougherty spokesman for the drug enforcement administration in 
washington 
wed like to point out that none of this cocaine is going out 
on the streets said leljedal adding that besides providing 
undercover officers with crack for their sweeps the program 
ensures that buyers are arrested in possession of real cocaine 
before going into court the sheriffs office must prove that 
the purchased material is the illegal substance a problem because 
sales of bogus crack are common leljedal said 
he also rejected suggestions of entrapment saying these are 
people who went out on the street to buy crack theyre addicts 
some attorneys have different views 
i think theres something sick about this whole system where 
the police make the product sell the product and arrest people for 
buying the product broward public defender alan schreiber told 
the fort lauderdale sunsentinel in a story published tuesday 
the sheriffs chemist who has made enough crack to sell for a 
total 20000 on the street said it makes his job easier because 
the drug usually stays inside cellophane bags during the sale and 
arrest so he can identify it without having to analyze it 
chemically before going into court 
chemist randy hilliard uses impounded cocaine to refine into 
crack and made his first batch in february from 22 pounds of 
seized cocaine he noted that use of confiscated drugs for sting 
operations isnt unusual 
the sheriffs office made 2300 crackrelated arrests in the 
first three months of this year leljedal didnt have precise 
figures for 1988 arrests but navarro who also heads a statewide 
anticrack task force has said his anticrack operations have 
been a national model 
navarros department is featured in the fox tv networks 
reallife series cops and allowed geraldo rivera to participate 
in an undercover operation for a television special and his 
prediliction for getting on the local evening news led a miami 
herald columnist to dub the show nick at nite 
navarro reelected by a landslide last november to a second 
fouryear term says his diligent pursuit of crack has strong 
community support 
i can tell you you ask the father or mother of any kid whos 
on crack cocaine if they have any reservations and see what they 
tell you they have none navarro said of his latest move 
navarro twice has been ordered into court by judges who 
threatened him with contempt citations most recently a federal 
judge complained about his use of tents to house overflow inmates 
other critics have said the crack sweeps overburden courts and 
jails and do little to provide a lasting solution

president carter for their arrests during a 1986 anticia 
demonstration 
his family has been flooded with letters telegrams and 
condolence calls from entertainers the carter family even foreign 
embassies his brother said im not going to say which he 
said lets just say some of our nato friends 
in keeping with hoffmans career his family has planned a noon 
peace march wednesday from his mothers house to temple emanuel 
which he attended as a child and where a memorial service will be 
held 
i want it to be a celebration hoffman said i want 
everybody to be singing and swinging and swaying 
folk singer pete seeger volunteered to lead the march and sing 
protest songs he said 
jack hoffman said his brother died nearly broke despite his 
book contracts and success on the lecture circuit he gave just 
about everything away he said he didnt die with a rolex he 
died with a full heart 
besides his brother and mother hoffman leaves a sister 
phyllis three children from his two marriages and his longtime

more than 500 police dislodged hundreds of 
demonstrating students from in front of the communist party 
headquarters early wednesday and moved them back toward their 
universities 
police used no force and no arrests were reported as the 
demonstrators left peacefully 
the police action at least temporarily ended more than two days 
of marches and demonstrations by thousands of students in beijing 
and shanghai demanding more democracy 
about 1500 demonstrators were milling outside the ornate gate 
of zhongnanhai the headquarters of the communist party when 
police arrived in jeeps at 420 am 
the police formed a line across the six lanes of changan 
boulevard the capitals main thoroughfare and began walking 
toward the students 
to march on the seat of government is illegal and cannot be 
permitted said a loudspeaker mounted on a truck it said the 
people of beijing love and remember former communist party 
chief hu yaobang but some people have been using his death to 
carry out irregular activities 
hu 73 died saturday and his death brought about the 
demonstrations and memorial marches hu considered a liberal was 
ousted from power in early 1987 for failing to stop prodemocracy 
student rallies in 198687 
about 3000 demonstrators had gathered in front of zhongnanhai 
tuesday but the crowd had dwindled to about half that when police 
moved in 
the police provided two buses for students and a few boarded the 
vehicles while the others walked back toward their universities 
followed by policemen the demonstrators offered no resistance 
getting arrested in china is not like getting arrested in 
america one student said here your whole life is ruined 
although no arrests were reported students said three of their 
representatives who entered zhongnanhai had not left the compound 
shortly after midnight some of the students had tried to force 
their way into the walled complex and they were shoved back 
repeatedly by dozens of plainclothes policemen 
flowered wreaths honoring hu and carried by some students were 
torn to pieces in the struggle 
the student rallies began monday and early tuesday when about 
2000 students from beijing university and other schools marched 
four hours to place banners on a monument to revolutionary heroes 
in tiananmen square 
wreathcarrying students from other colleges paraded to the 
monument throughout the day tuesday and hundreds of students 
staged a daylong sitin in front of the great hall of the people 
demanding freedom of speech and press and public disclosures of the 
incomes of officials 
they chanted long live democracy and down with 
dictatorship repeatedly they sang the internationale a 
socalist anthem 
they also shouted come out li peng 
li chinas premier recently rejected rapid political reforms 
saying too much democracy would lead to political instability 
late tuesday the students marched around the square in a rally 
that swelled to about 10000 people including bystanders many of 
the demonstrators walked for about 300 yards down changan boulevard 
to zhongnanhai while others left the procession 
this is the most serious demonstration in the past 10 years 
said one student who took part in the 198687 demonstrations we 
did not come here to zhongnanhai then because it is so 
sensitive 
it was the first major demonstration at zhongnanhai since the 
196676 cultural revolution when radical youths known as red 
guards tried to enter the walled compound to drag out leaders they 
accused of capitalist crimes 
in tiananmen the 100acre plaza that is the symbolic center of 
power in china many peasants other workers and young people had 
joined the students 
some bystanders expressed support but said they doubted the 
rallies for democracy would achieve anything and economic issues 
were more important 
you cant eat democracy said one worker who complained 
about inflation now at a rate of more than 30 percent in some 
cities 
some student leaders issued seven demands and asked for a 
representative from the national peoples congress the parliament 
to meet with them 
the demands were for a reassessment of hus role an end to 
antiliberal political campaigns revealing the incomes of leaders 
freedom of speech and press better pay for intellectuals an end 
to a ban on demonstrations and news coverage of the student rallies 
administrative officials from the congress who met student 
representatives tuesday refused to accept the demands and told the 
demonstrators to go home

for a limited time only drug users in 
marylands worcester county can avoid prosecution by kicking the 
habit and turning in their suppliers 
an ad running in several weekly newspapers offers amnesty from 
prosecution until may 15 and includes a phone number to the 
countys special narcotics team the ads first appeared last 
wednesday and thursday 
on friday we got so many phone calls we had to advise the 
people who were calling to call back this week because we couldnt 
process them all states attorney b randall coates said tuesday 
coates who signed the ad wouldnt say how many people tried to 
take advantage but said it was substantially more than a dozen 
when drug users call authorities question them to decide 
whether they are qualified for the program those who are are asked 
to arrange a drug purchase from their dealer with an undercover 
officer present coates said 
once we have that we arrest the seller and give immunity to 
the user coates said the immunity is only good for the last 
known drug violation that has gone unprosecuted 
users will be referred to the countys drug program 
the offer does not does not apply to drug dealers smugglers or 
drugoperation financiers the ad says howeverthose offenders can 
also make a deal by cooperating with authorities 
coates said the amnesty idea has proven effective for collecting 
revenue from tax cheaters in maryland and elsewhere so he decided 
to try it to help curb the drug trade 
the purpose of the ad is to give those who do have a problem 
and want help the opportunity to come forward and get the help 
they need he said 
the other purpose of the ad is to make it clear to those who 
are selling or smuggling in this county that we are serious 
about prosecuting them and in fact they cannot trust anybody let 
alone law enforcement 
we are hoping they will not want to deal in worcester county 
because they can get turned in by the people they are selling to 
coates said its a psychological war as well as a prosecution 
war 
worcester on the lower eastern shore contains ocean city 
marylands most popular resort ocean citys offseason population 
of about 5000 regularly swells to 300000 on summer weekends 
providing another incentive for getting local dealers off the 
streets before the vacation season begins 
state attorney general j joseph curran called the program a 
novel idea 
what its doing is making people in the drug network nervous 
and thats good from a law enforcement standpoint curran said 
and its letting them know that after may 15 nothing will be 
tolerated

nicaraguan rebel leaders tuesday accused their 
countrys leftist government of unleashing a preelection campaign 
of repression and murder and a human rights group offered some 
unprecedented confirmation 
the sandinista government is massacring supporters of the 
resistance contra director aristides sanchez said at a news 
conference in the groups miami headquarters they are wiping out 
our entire social base 
the contras accused the sandinista military of slaughtering 40 
to 50 civilians over the past two months in northern nicaraguan 
provinces where the ussupported rebels were once strongest 
including 13 in the town of apantillo 
for the first time the widely respected human rights group 
americas watch which in the past has criticized the contras 
agreed that the sandinistas are killing suspected rebel 
sympathizers in the countryside 
we cannot dismiss them as isolated incidents any more said 
americas watch spokesman juan mendez in washington we have 
written the nicaraguan government and are waiting to see what they 
are doing about this 
the withdrawal of armed contras that followed a recent series of 
peace agreements has left their supporters open to repression said 
adolfo calero another of the seven rebel directors 
they are taking advantage of the truce and the peace 
agreements to eliminate all our supporters calero said 
a physician who calls himself dr henry and who has treated 
contra troops and sympathizers inside nicaragua for five years 
said the sandinistas also have mined roads along the honduran and 
costa rican borders resulting in the deaths of eight innocent 
victims 
on another matter calero charged that the supreme electoral 
council newly created to oversee next years planned national 
elections violates promises the sandinistas made at a meeting of 
central american presidents in el salvador to create a balanced 
commission 
he said president daniel ortega and the sandinistacontrolled 
national assembly will appoint and approve all five members 
including two representatives of the opposition 
this is no way to initiate the electoral process in 
nicaragua calero said and we expect the central american 
presidents to demand it be changed 
the contras who have just won a 50 million nonlethal aid 
package from the united states denied they have been pressured by 
the bush administration to return to nicaragua to participate in 
the efforts to democratize the country 
i have heard nothing from the bush administration and i will 
return to nicaragua when i decide to which is when the internal 
opposition asks us to return calero said

a jury convicted a christian science 
couple of murder and child abuse tuesday in the death of their 
7yearold daughter for relying on spiritual practitioners to cure 
her diabetes 
william hermanson 42 and his wife christine 38 were charged 
with thirddegree murder and felony child abuse their daughter 
amy died of diabetes in 1986 after the couple tried to heal her 
with prayer instead of medical treatment 
the hermansons face three to seven years in prison under state 
sentencing guidelines sarasota circuit judge stephen dakan set no 
sentencing date and released the hermansons on their own 
recognizance 
we were disappointed and surprised defense attorney charles 
arnold said after the sixmember jury deliberated three hours we 
will be filing motions for a new trial 
jurors refused to comment as they filed silently from the 
courthouse 
christian science doctrine relies on prayer and spiritual 
practitioners rather than on medicine to heal however there are 
no church sanctions for followers who seek medical aid and a 
christian science nurse who tended amy testified that when she saw 
prayer wasnt working she urged a spiritual healer to summon an 
ambulance 
the hermansons were the first christian scientists in 20 years 
prosecuted in the united states for denying a child medical care 
for religious reasons church representatives said five other 
religious exemption cases are pending three in california one 
each in arizona and massachusetts 
last week with the jury out of the room a state witness 
testified both parents had sought medical treatment for themselves 
but not for their daughter 
the jury never heard that testimony because the judge upheld a 
defense objection that prosecutors withheld the information from 
opposing attorneys before trial violating rules of discovery 
during the weeklong trial defense laywers claimed the couple 
were legitimately practicing the tenets of their religion a right 
they said was protected under florida law the defense called no 
witnesses however 
a 1975 state law protects parents who withhold medical treatment 
from their sick children if they are legitimately practicing 
their religious beliefs 
prosecutors said the case was about the childs rights not the 
parents religious rights amy was sick for weeks and her parents 
let her die without any medical attention the state said

a us grand jury indicted 11 people 
including the alleged godfather and godmother of a 
humansacrificing cult of drug smugglers blamed for 15 deaths on 
drug charges tuesday 
the alleged godfather adolfo de jesus constanzo sara 
aldrete villarreal the alleged godmother and the other nine 
were indicted by a federal grand jury in mcallen texas 
they were charged with conspiracy to import marijuana importing 
marijuana conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute the drug 
and possession with intent to distribute authorities said 
constanzo aldrete and four others remained at large four men 
are in custody in mexico and another suspect was arrested monday in 
houston 
meanwhile a mexican police official said most of the 15 bodies 
exhumed in a rural area over the past week were those of drug 
traffickers and not random sacrificial victims 
juan benitez ayala commander of the federal judicial police in 
this border city said the investigation has shifted to mexico 
city where officials believe several murders are linked to adolfo 
de jesus constanzo 26 the alleged godfather 
benitez refused to comment on statements he made to reporters 
monday when he speculated that aldrete 24 may have been killed 
by constanzo because she knew too much about the organization 
us officials said they thought she was still alive even 
though mexican officials reported finding some of her personal 
effects in an apartment containing an apparent occult altar 
it just might be a puton said cameron county sheriff alex 
perez in brownsville texas if they did find a purse or found a 
passport that may have been just a trick by sara and constanzo to 
make it appear she is dead i think she is still alive 
he said the investigation in matamoros has shown that most of 
the 13 bodies unearthed at the santa elena ranch 20 miles west of 
matamoros last week and two found sunday at a nearby cooperative 
farm were those of drug smugglers 
i have information about only four people who were 
sacrificed benitez said adding that the great majority were 
drug traffickers 
of the 15 victims some were tortured some were only shot 
and there were the young people who were sacrificed 
university of texas student mark kilroy 21 of santa fe texas 
abducted from a matamoros street was one of the four sacrificial 
victims not involved in the drug business benitez said 
he said at least eight and possibly more of the victims were 
either associates or rivals of the constanzo group 
officials have searched at least three residences in mexico city 
linked to the group benitez said there are a lot of murders in 
the colonia roma area of mexico city connected to constanzo he 
said 
benitez said a woman arrested sunday in mexico city maria 
teresa quintana 20 was deeply involved in the occult practices of 
some members of the group who sought magical protection for their 
smuggling 
her brother martin quintana is one of three men for whom new 
federal drugrelated warrants were issued monday in brownsville 
quintana and another named in the new warrants malio fabio 
are believed to have participated in the occult faction of the 
constanzo organization 
one man arrested on those warrants serafin hernandez rivera of 
brownsville was arraigned tuesday in houston where he was 
arrested 
benitez said hernandez father brigido former owner of the 
santa elena ranch is being sought in mexico serafin hernandez 
riveras son serafin jr and brother elio faced federal mexican 
arraignment tuesday in matamoros hernandez riveras brother 
ovidio also is being sought in connection with the slayings 
sheriff perez said officials had confirmed that constanzo and 
two other men took a flight from mcallen texas to mexico city the 
day the first 12 bodies were found he said investigators believe 
they then flew to miami 
perez said it appeared ms aldrete did not accompany them but 
he would not elaborate 
some of the drug ring members practiced human sacrifices in a 
belief apparently influenced by the palo mayombe religion that 
the slayings and mutilations might protect them magically a movie 
the believers which deals with a violent cult influenced the 
sects members according to confessions officials said 
actor martin sheen who starred in the movie said monday i 
am too shocked and deeply upset that anything im involved with 
could be so misinterpreted and lead to such a heinous crime 
sheen who also is known for his peace activism starred as a 
police psychiatrist investigating the cult in the john schlesinger 
film

the chairman of exxon corp on tuesday angrily 
defended the companys response to the alaska oil spill and blamed 
delays in the cleanup on indecisive regulatory agencies 
the most damaging thats being said about us is that weve 
delayed it were very slow to respond and so forth thats 
absolutely not true lawrence g rawl said at a news conference 
rawl said the plan to clean up prince william sound and 305 
miles of shoreline announced by the company monday had been 
approved by all necessary agencies the exxon valdez ran aground 
march 24 spilling 10 million gallons of crude oil in the nations 
worst oil spill 
exxon promised to have most of the beaches and rocks clean by 
midseptember 
some officials including adm paul yost head of the coast 
guard have expressed skepticism that the cleanup can be 
accomplished that rapidly 
what does he want us to do put in a deadline next year so 
that he can say its too damn late that deadline you got in 
there rawl said adding youre damned if you do and youre 
damned if you dont 
the cleanup will involve at least 4000 workers who must contend 
with high tides and rocky shores in hardtogetto places 
logistical problems are horrendous rawl said these are 
not meant as excuses i just want you to know that you just cant 
cover this place up as if you had a sand beach somewhere 
now im not going to tell you that if you go up there a year 
from now you wont find some black places on some rocks rawl 
said but were going to make every effort to get it off i am 
telling you that a year from now the toxicity will be eliminated 
yost who left tuesday for washington to brief president bush 
declined to comment on rawls outburst but said he was glad rawls 
felt confident the cleanup could be accomplished 
im on his side yost said i say lets give him a shot at 
it 
he repeated his reservations about whether exxon could beat 
alaskas notorious weather and brief summer and get the beaches 
cleaned by winter 
but he said there was nothing personal in his reservations 
rawl repeatedly defended exxons reaction to the spill saying 
contingency plans were foiled by a lack of decisive action by the 
alaska department of environmental conservation and the coast guard 
he said exxon had enough oil dispersant on hand to begin 
spraying march 25 about 30 hours after the spill and was awaiting 
approval from the state and the coast guard 
records exxon filed with the state after the accident said 
controlling the valdez spill would have required 500000 gallons of 
dispersant when the tanker hit the reef according to earlier 
reports exxon had only 3795 gallons on hand and just 110000 six 
days later 
im not trying to say were not responsible rawl said it 
was our ship we spilled the oil we intend to clean it up and we 
intend to do it promptly

the first researcher to obtain room 
temperature fusion offered his services tuesday to one of the 
nations top nuclear laboratories in hopes of getting support for 
his research in return 
university of utah professor stanley pons said that in helping 
los alamos national laboratory scientists to duplicate his fusion 
experiments he could gain their collaboration on future research 
los alamos thus far has been unable to confirm the results that 
pons and his british colleague martin fleischmnann obtained last 
month at the university of utah 
i dont think there can be any collaboration until they start 
getting a result and so its my determination now to make sure 
that they do pons said 
pons said monday he had sustained a controlled fusion reaction 
more than 800 hours in a small flask containing heavy water 
which contains the isotope deuterium and a palladium electrode he 
said recent tests produced roughly eight times the energy consumed 
pons told a news conference that the results he and fleischmann 
obtained had been partly verified by more than 60 university and 
private laboratories around the world 
in stanford calif on tuesday stanford university professor 
robert huggins said that in trying to duplicate the utah work he 
had determined that the energy produced may have been caused by 
fusion and did not come from a chemical reaction as some other 
scientists have speculated 
pons who left tuesday without a commitment from los alamos 
said he was able to find one possible reason why scientists here 
had been unable to duplicate his experiment the palladium 
electrodes they used are not in the same form as the rods he used 
in utah pons said 
pons said los alamos has sophisticated spectrometers and other 
precise measuring devices that could be useful in confirming the 
results of his research 
one of the purposes in coming down was to see if there is 
equipment that i could use that would lead to confirmation or more 
substantiation of some of the new experiments that we are doing 
he said 
pons said his research may open the door to practical 
application of nuclear fusion in which tremendous amounts of 
energy are released when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse 
scientists in the past had been unable to fuse atoms except at 
temperatures in the millions of degrees 
nuclear power plants produce energy through fission in which 
atoms are split the process requires radioactive fuel and 
generates large amounts of radioactive waste fusion does not

yippie founder abbie hoffman committed 
suicide with a massive overdose of the drug phenobarbital the 
coroner said tuesday 
the death was from the combined effects of phenobarbital and 
alcohol coroner dr thomas rosko said at a news conference 
hoffman who held fast to his antiestablishment convictions and 
made his points with searing humor was found dead april 12 at his 
home in new hope he was 52 
i think it is likely that he literally fell asleep and died in 
his sleep rosko said other than that what occurred in his 
last hours is strictly speculation 
the autopsy found the residue of about 150 pills several times 
the lethal dose even without the presence of alcohol the coroner 
said phenobarbital a barbiturate is a longacting sedative and 
an anticonvulsant 
hoffmans blood alcohol level was 20 twice the legal limit in 
pennsylvania rosko said 
the coroner said laboratory tests showed two other drugs were 
present in hoffmans system but he said the small quantities of 
propranolol used for cardiovascular conditions and 
benzodiazepine a class of drugs including the sedative valium had 
no connection with hoffmans death 
although hoffman was considered a selftaught expert in drugs 
rosko said there was no evidence he was using drugs for pleasure 
the coroner said he relayed his findings to hoffmans family 
minutes before his news conference 
although rosko ruled the death a suicide hoffmans brother 
jack held out hope it was an accident 
abbie as many of you know was somewhat careless with pills 
and we always warned him about this kind of thing jack hoffman 
said at a news conference in worcester mass the familys 
hometown 
hoffmans mother florence declined to comment 
the day after her sons body was found she speculated that he 
had committed suicide saying he had sounded depressed in recent 
telephone conversations but the next day she said the family no 
longer suspected suicide 
other relatives and friends mentioned suicide rosko said friday 
there was no indication then that hoffman killed himself but that 
preliminary results were inconclusive roskos autopsy report last 
week also did not elaborate on a trickle of blood reported found 
caked under hoffmans nostril 
in june 1988 hoffman said he was taking painkillers a doctor 
had prescribed for injuries he suffered in an auto accident 
hoffman was last seen alive on april 11 by a girlfriend of his 
landlord he was found dead by a neighbor michael waldron who 
told police hoffman had been depressed about the car accident 
a memorial service planned wednesday in worcester mass is to 
include a peace march from his mothers house to temple emanuel 
which hoffman attended as a child 
i want it to be a celebration said jack hoffman i want 
everybody to be singing and swinging and swaying folk singer 
pete seeger volunteered to lead the march and sing protest songs 
he said 
hoffmans family has been flooded with letters telegrams and 
condolence calls from entertainers even foreign embassies his 
brother said im not going to say which he said lets just 
say some of our nato friends 
jack hoffman said his brother died nearly broke despite book 
contracts and success on the lecture circuit he gave just about 
everything away he said he didnt die with a rolex he died 
with a full heart 
hoffman rose to prominence with the chicago seven a group of 
radicals tried on charges of conspiring to disrupt the bloody 1968 
democratic national convention in chicago the others were thomas 
hayden jerry rubin david dellinger reynard c davis lee weiner 
and john froines 
theatrics at the 4monthlong federal trial included 
wildhaired defendants and a 74yearold judge julius hoffman who 
ordered bobby seale a former black panther leader bound and 
gagged in the courtroom seales trial was later severed from the 
others 
hoffman and four others were acquitted of conspiracy but 
convicted of crossing state lines with intent to riot their 
convictions were overturned 
during a reunion of the chicago seven last year hoffman 
characterized himself as an american dissident 
hoffman started the loosely organized yippie movement or youth 
international party in 1968 to bring together radicals to protest 
the government and the vietnam war 
hoffman went underground in 1974 to avoid trial on cocaine 
possession charges he emerged nearly seven years later and 
revealed he had lived in upstate new york and had undergone plastic 
surgery 
he moved to the philadelphia suburb of new hope several years 
ago during the height of a losing battle against a delaware river 
pumping station 
besides his brother and mother hoffman leaves a sister 
phyllis three children from his two marriages and his longtime 
companion johanna lawrenson hoffmans ashes were given to ms 
lawrenson his brother said

a foreign ministry official said tuesday after 
returning from cairo that egypt accepts the idea of elections in 
the occupied territories proposed by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
foreign ministry directorgeneral reuven merhav said egyptian 
foreign minister esmat abdel meguid and other egyptian officials 
reacted positively to shamirs plan for elections to choose 
representatives with whom israel could negotiate palestinian 
autonomy 
they accept rather than support the principle of 
elections said merhav who returned monday from a fourday visit 
to egypt i made it very clear the only way to get things moving 
was through elections i think at this stage the principle was 
accepted 
merhav said the egyptians raised no conditions for their support 
and did not allude to statements by president hosni mubarak that 
the vote should be held under international supervision 
nor did the egyptians refer to the insistence of the palestine 
liberation organization that israel withdraw from the occupied 
territories prior to balloting he said 
there was no talk of international supervision this was not 
in the cards at all merhav told reporters the issue of the 
plo also was not raised 
on sunday during merhavs visit egyptian officials criticized 
israels handing of the 16month palestinian uprising and demanded 
a positive israeli response to the plos revised stand recognizing 
israels right to exist 
the officials made no formal statement on shamirs election 
plan plo chief yasser arafat has demanded israeli withdrawal and 
international supervision as conditions for accepting elections 
shamir proposed his plan at a meeting with president bush last 
week it essentially mirrors the 1978 ussponsored camp david 
accords rejected by the palestinians because they promise only 
selfrule under israeli control 
both shamirs plan and camp david call for later negotiations on 
the final status of the gaza strip and west bank occupied by 
israel since the 1967 middle east war 
the one change in shamirs plan is the offer to hold elections 
to choose palestinian represenatives to negotiate an interim 
settlement with israel previous israeli proposals called for 
elections only after an autonomy agreement was worked out

taffylike tar mixed with seaweed was 
scoured off a beach tuesday at the end of spectacular resurrection 
bay near seward the first town outside prince william sound to 
suffer oil on its shores 
high tides and southerly wind off the gulf of alaska pushed the 
crude oil up the fjordlike channel where two coast guard 
oilskimming ships were out of action because the goo gummed up 
their pumps deputy seward city manager darryl schaefermeyer said 
we put protective booming up around the critical salmon 
spawning streams in the bay four weeks ago schaefermeyer said 
but as far as the rest of the bay there was no effective way of 
booming it all off 
the coast guard reported fresh sightings of oil on remote 
beaches on the kenai peninsula a valdez center for cleaning 
oilfouled birds said at least 1850 birds had died from the spill 
along with 328 sea otters the center has cleaned and released 22 
birds 
resurrection bay with a channel 600 feet deep is about 125 air 
miles from where the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 
dumping more than 10 million gallons of alaska crude oil into 
prince william sound 
adm paul yost the coast guard chief approved exxons cleanup 
plan for the sound monday but expressed reservations about whether 
it could succeed 
lawrence rawl chairman of exxon corp reacted angrily tuesday 
at a news conference in new york he said he was confident that 
most of the beaches and rocks would be clean by midseptember 
now im not going to tell you that if you go up there a year 
from now you wont find some black places on some rocks but were 
going to make every effort to get it off he said i am telling 
you that a year from now the toxicity will be eliminated 
yost before leaving for washington on tuesday to brief 
president bush said he believed exxons cleanup plan was a good 
start 
exxon is committed to doing this i say lets give him rawl 
a shot at it he said 
but he said he still had reservations that exxon could clean the 
beaches by winter and added that if efforts lagged he would force 
the company to throw more people and gear into the task 
yost gave exxon until may 1 to complete a cleanup plan for 
outside the sheltered sound where the work is likely to be even 
harder along the wild gulf of alaska coast 
in boston massachusetts state sen carol amick said she was 
organizing a oneday boycott throughout new england on may 2 to 
protest exxons failure to respond to the environmental 
disaster 
a sizeable but undetermined amount of oil has seeped out of the 
sound and into the gulf where currents carried it southwest along 
the kenai peninsula a weekend storm pushed oil north onto hundreds 
of miles of rocky beaches and far up the bays and inlets including 
resurrection bay 
huge swells along the exposed coast will often prevent boats or 
crews from working close to the beach said peter fitzmaurice 
chief ranger at kenai fjords national park which stretches from 
seward southwest along most of the southern coast of the peninsula 
they can work the inner bays but if a big swell comes in 
theres no way theyll be able to work near the rocks he said 
farther southwest near the end of the peninsula skimming 
operations have been on hold for several days because of waves up 
to 12 feet experts say he ships are designed to work in waves of 
no more than five feet 
a huge soviet oil skimmer able to process far more oil in much 
heavier seas than skimmers now available is scheduled to arrive 
thursday in seward 
everyone has some pretty high hopes for this russian ship 
schaefermeyer said its pretty big 430 feet and it apparently 
has the capacity for getting far down into the water to get at some 
of the stuff you cant see 
the state ferry aurora carrying 20 skiffs on a cleanup mission 
since early this month was greeted by a ballooncarrying crowd as 
it returned to valdez for six hours to resupply 
the skiffs round up oil with floating booms then tow it to a 
barge for disposal by a supersucker vacuum hose workers said 
the technique had been used to remove 200000 gallons of oil from 
the water 
coast guard aircraft reported oil washing ashore all along the 
kenai peninsula headlands and spotters saw significant shoreline 
impact at lone perry and culross islands in prince william 
sound the coast guard said 
the coast guard sent three skimmers to perry island but 
operations stalled because pumps were unable to remove the 
nowtarlike oil from the skimmers 
exxon said it had recovered 113 million gallons of oil about 
11 percent of the amount spilled 
meantime exxon and the oil pipeline consortium alyeska were 
given 90 days warning tuesday that environmental groups intend to 
sue them to ensure cleanup of americas worst oil spill 
the sierra club wilderness society and audubon society were 
joined by an array of local state and national organizations in 
serving the notice which is required under federal resource 
conservation law 
in washington energy secretary james d watkins said tuesday 
that the spill has blackened the image of the oil industry 
every oil company will have to confront the images created by 
the spill watkins said in a speech to the national petroleum 
council a group of private energy officials that advises the 
energy secretary on policy issues 
he said his department would try to persuade congress and the 
public that the spill was an aberration that should not halt future 
oil development in alaska watkins said his department will 
continue to lobby for legislation permitting oil companies to 
explore for oil in the arctic national wildlife refuge

americas last remaining 
u2c spy plane which photographed clandestine missiles in cuba and 
military bases in the soviet union set eight records tuesday on 
one of its last flights 
the plane commonly called simply a u2 is being retired and 
put on display after 34 years of service 
it was the second day the oncesupersecret surveillance plane 
made special flights from this desert base 60 miles north of los 
angeles to try and set new records before being retired 
lockheed test pilot ron williams 54 shattered existing 
altitude records in the planes weight class by about 40 percent 
according to lockheed spokesman nick durutta 
the records include reaching an altitude of 72720 without a 
payload and in horizontal flight it also climbed to various 
altitudes faster than previous record holders 
the aircraft had previously flown at such altitudes but the 
marks were not verified the national aeronautics and space 
administration and the federation aeronautique international must 
still confirm tuesdays records 
lockheed reported that on monday the plane soared to 73700 feet 
in 12 minutes and 13 seconds shattering by more than 20000 feet 
the previous altitude record for a plane in its weight class 
theres only one u2c in existence that is still flying 
said maj susan randle of strategic air command headquarters at 
offutt air force base in nebraska 
the last u2c will be flown to warnerrobbins air force base in 
georgia on april 26 to be put on display 
the air force will continue to fly the updated u2r model built 
in 1981 
because of the crafts topsecret nature the military has never 
confirmed the exact number built in 1955 by lockheed at its 
topsecret skunk works plant but it has been estimated at 57 
it was a u2c that brought back the photographic proof during 
the cuban missile crisis of 1962 that the soviets had installed 
missiles in that island country just off the coast of florida 
it was also a u2c that the late francis gary powers was 
piloting over the soviet union when it was shot down in 1960 his 
capture helped chill the cold war even more as soviet premier 
nikita khruschev canceled a summit meeting with president dwight 
eisenhower 
more recently u2s were used to record the eruptions of mount 
st helens and to provide information to firefighters battling last 
summers blazes in yellowstone national park 
the plane a forerunner of the stealth fighter was designed by 
lockheed to fly undetected nearly 14 miles above the earth several 
were shot down on missions and many crashed in flight because the 
planes were so tricky to fly due to their thin wings the air force 
loaned several to nasaames research laboratories at moffett field 
near san francisco 
the planes days became numbered with the advent of satellites 
and a new generation of spy planes including the sr71 blackbird

the united states said tuesday that it is becoming 
more difficult to monitor compliance with a proposed 
chemicalweapons ban because of greater sophistication in the 
chemical industry 
ambassador max l friedersdorf addressing the 40nation 
conference on disarmament said determining that there are no 
hidden stocks of chemical weapons and no secret production 
facilities remain our most formidable challenge 
he said the challenge is becoming more difficult because of the 
trend in the chemical industry to produce multipurpose facilities 
that can easily be converted to manufacture chemicalweapon agents 
measures to prevent cheating are one of the main issues that 
have prevented an agreement on a treaty to ban the use production 
and stockpiling of chemical weapons the negotiations are now in 
their 21st year

a plane searching for two sailors missing from a 
freighter that sank in stormy seas spotted a body floating in the 
atlantic ocean on tuesday a coast guard official said 
twentythree rescued sailors nursed bruises and waited for news 
while longrange aircraft and several merchant vessels fanned out 
over 480 square miles of ocean about 400 miles southeast of cape 
cod where the star of alexandria sank monday 
the body was spotted by one of three coast guard planes coast 
guard petty officer mike milan said in new york 
surviving crew members said one of the missing sailors 
apparently injured himself when he jumped overboard as the ship 
went down 
the feeling is that was him milan said but we havent 
given up hope of finding the other man 
milan said the second man had a chance to survive because he was 
uninjured and wearing a life jacket when he washed off a life raft 
the water temperature is warm enough that he could survive 
indefinitely milan said 
one way or another we hope to wrap this thing up tomorrow 
he said 
the surviving crew members who were transferred to the coast 
guard cutter chilula from the british freighter ravenscraig earlier 
in the day should arrive in boston late wednesday he said 
the crew will be interviewed as to what happened on the ship 
and then the company that owned the ship will take care of it from 
there petty officer gary rives said 
he said it still was unclear what caused the sinking 
the ravenscraig picked up the 23 multinational crew members 
after rescue planes spotted a lifeboat and a life raft and guided 
the 950foot vessel to the scene said petty officer joe gibson a 
second life raft was recovered but empty he said 
the 500foot star of alexandria was bound for new york city from 
athens when crew members reported it began taking on water in

the star of alexandria was registered in england and designed to 
carry bulk freight the ship is owned by caribene investments ltd 
of gibraltar according to bureau veritas a parisbased shipping

defense secretary richard cheney has told 
president bush that he favors building a railroadbased version of 
the mx nuclear missile and scrapping the planned midgetman missile 
the washington post reported 
cheney made his views known in a meeting tuesday afternoon at 
the white house before leaving for a nato meeting in europe the 
newspaper reported in its wednesday editions 
but a white house source who declined to be named said no 
decision was made at the meeting which was called as the next step 
in the long fight over whether to build a railbased version of the 
10warhead mx or up to 500 of the singlewarhead midgetman 
no timetable has been set for making a decison said the source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
both weapons are designed as successors to the minuteman which 
has formed the heart of the nations landbased atomic missile 
force for two decades the pentagon has also built 50 mx weapons 
for deployment in silos in nebraska and wyoming 
if cheney favors the railbased mx over the midgetman he would 
be taking the position long favored by the air force service 
officials have proposed creating 25 trains each with two mx 
missiles aboard and keeping them on western military reservations 
to be moved out onto civilian tracks in time of crisis 
the midgetman has chiefly been supported by democrats who 
control congress 
cheney is scheduled to appear before congress next week to 
unveil bushs plans for amending the pentagon budget proposed 
earlier this year by thenpresident reagan bush has to approve 10 
billion worth of budget cuts to meet lowered spending targets

explosions blacked out most of santiago 
tuesday night and police said two men were killed while trying to 
place a bomb at a utility tower after a national strike turned into 
a day of street battles 
chiles largest labor federation had called the national strike 
to protest the military governments banishment of two union 
leaders into internal exile government officials and business 
organizations called the strike a failure 
police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse groups of 
strikers and their supporters in santiago and other cities and 
more than 100 people were arrested 
those disorders tapered off at dusk but after nighfall the 
violence spread to the slums ringing santiago demonstrators 
blocked street with burning barricades and gunshots and explosions 
were heard 
police said security forces in santiago intercepted two men 
attempting to place an explosive device at a utility tower and 
opened fire killing both suspects 
most of santiago with a population of 45 million was blacked 
out at about 930 pm and police blamed the power failure on 
bombings of several electricline pylons within a half hour power 
had been restored to some secions of the capital 
the interior ministry said 138 people were arrested throughout 
the country including 84 in santiago during the day no report 
was issued on the later violence 
at dusk the streets in downtown santiago were virtually 
deserted the air thick with tear gas public transportation came 
to a standstill as bus owners withdrew their vehicles after several 
were damaged 
what strike interior minister carlos caceres said when 
reporters asked about the walkout called by the united workers 
central which claims 300000 members in chiles labor force of 45 
million 
he said the situation was near normal throughout the country 
workers attended their jobs normally and schools were also 
funcioning normally 
the minister and other officials acknowledged public transport 
was severely curtailed in the morning and attributed it to fear by 
drivers of attacks on themselves and their vehicles 
diego olivares acting president of the labor federation said 
thousands of workers stayed home and many others went to their jobs 
late osvaldo verdugo president of the national school teachers 
association said more than half the students in santiago did not 
attend school 
olivares federation called the strike to protest the continued 
banishment to small provincial towns of its president manuel 
bustos and vice president arturo martinez both were sentenced 
last september to 541 days of internal exile for calling a strike 
in 1987 
independent reports confirmed little absenteeism at most 
industries and factories but some industries were idled by lack of 
electric power 
parts of santiago also had been blacked out by bombings early 
tuesday and caceres said those attacks confirm what the 
government said that the real aim of this strike was to promote 
violence and terrorism 
the government power company said seven power pylons were 
destroyed by terrorists in the bombings tuesday morning 
there was no immediate report on the damage from the tuesday 
night attacks 
a police report on the bombings early tuesday said at least 
eight explosions in santiago wounded two men and damaged a bank 
telephone company office bus terminal and municipal building

in alaska but exxon and a government energy official told a senate 
hearing the accident wasnt the reason 
that wasnt enough to convince sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
who criticized other oil companies for passing up an invitation to 
appear monday before his energy subcommittee on energy regulation 
and conservation 
you have an amazing burden of proof to convince the american 
people that the oil companies didnt exploit the valdez accident 
metzenbaum said i also invited arco mobil chevron bp texaco 
shell and amoco and i regret their failure to appear 
in the three weeks following the spill gasoline prices jumped 
10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country

ben kingsley had played reallife figures 
before but none that were still living much less there on the set 
watching his performance 
in the hbo movie murderers among us the simon wiesenthal 
story kingsley plays the title character famous nazi hunter 
simon wiesenthal who at 80 was most interested in how his story 
was to be put down on film for posterity 
in the opening scene of the movie premiering sunday wiesenthal 
is liberated from the concentration camp where he risked his life 
making drawings of the horrors as a record of the nazi crimes 
craig t nelson plays maj harcourt an american officer who was 
among the liberators 
i did the first scene involving collapsing into craig t 
nelsons arms with my drawings recalled kingsley and i looked 
up from doing that scene and there was simon sitting about 20 feet 
away from me with tears streaming down his face but smiling at me 
like a kind uncle whos watched his nephew win the 400 meters you 
know a wonderful mixture of great pain and great pride that we had 
got it on film 
and thats what he wanted to do is get it down on paper get 
it down on film get it in front of the hearts and the eyes and the 
minds of young people who either do not know or do not believe that 
these things took place and im afraid they have to know 
kingsley who won an oscar in 1982 for his lead performance in 
gandhi said he was picked by wiesenthal to play the part 
this from the man himself was very flattering and more 
importantly very very encouraging kingsley said in a telephone 
interview from his home in london 
i thought well at least hes behind the casting which gave 
me some confidence because the scale of the man is almost 
unactable the scale of experience what he had to witness is 
almost unimaginable kingsley said 
i knew that it would be a very difficult role very difficult 
indeed and simons embrace of me was very important emotionally 
psychologically for my morale as an actor 
kingsley said he had been in wiesenthals home city of vienna 
making an italian film when he first heard of the hbo project in 
1987 but decided not to meet with wiesenthal until the offer was 
firm then he and renee soutendijk who plays cyla wiesenthal in 
the movie went together to meet the couple 
it was a very very exciting and extraordinary meeting full 
of emotional information not simply because i was going to portray 
the man but to meet the man was an important experience 
kingsley said 
you are meeting a prophet you are meeting a spokesman the 
voice of 11 million people and that really comes off the man the 
energy of that obsession and i use that word kindly and that 
burning quest is visible in the mans eyes his physique in his 
voice and in the massive authority that he has every time he 
speaks very kind very wise man but a very formidable character 
the movie traces wiesenthal from his liberation in 1945 through 
his tireless quest to bring nazi war criminals to justice most 
notably adolph eichmann who had escaped to argentina through 
wiesenthals efforts eichmann was arrested and brought to israel 
where he was tried convicted and hanged 
wiesenthal has actively participated in publicizing the film 
which he sees as an extension of his work keeping the holocaust 
alive in peoples minds so it cannot happen again kingsley avoided 
thinking of the sociological ramifications of the movie during 
filming 
if youre climbing a mountain knowing that you have to place a 
flag on the top of the mountain when youre halfway up the 
mountain if the flag is in your knapsack you dont keep taking it 
out and looking at it what you look at is where you put your hand 
next and where you put your foot next if the ramifications of 
placing the flag on the top of the mountain are your preoccupation 
10to1 youre going to fall off the mountain 
kingsley who most recently appeared in the comedy without a 
clue with michael caine is off to brazil next month to film a 
french comedy the fifth monkey

simon wiesenthal stood among 40 naked 
shivering men as a nazi officer stepped down the line shooting 
each man in the temple and sending them toppling into the stone 
quarry below 
two men away from being shot wiesenthal was reprieved a 
messenger ran up and said his services were needed to paint a sign 
honoring adolf hitlers birthday 
wiesenthal dedicated his survival to the dead documenting the 
nazi atrocities and hunting down some 6000 nazis over the past 40 
years so they could be brought to trial 
the story of his life powerfully portrayed by oscarwinning 
british actor ben kingsley is told in murderers among us the 
simon wiesenthal story a home box office production premiering 
sunday on the paycable channel 
the message in the movie is justice not revenge 
wiesenthal 80 said after seeing the threehour film at a preview 
here i am one of the witnesses after i am gone the movie will 
survive 
was the movie truetolife this is not a case of fact being 
stronger than fiction he said in an interview it was all 
fact even the dramatization 
kingsley 54 bestknown for his oscarwinning performance as 
the pacifist indian leader gandhi bears a strong likeness to 
wiesenthal in his younger years we were born on the same date 
dec 31 maybe thats why he was totally in my skin hes a 
brilliant actor said wiesenthal who spent time with kingsley 
during filming in hungary 
when wiesenthal first walked onto a set depicting the mauthausen 
concentration camp where he was held he wept it was so strong 
i couldnt help crying he said 
more than 40 years ago when us troops rolled into mauthausen 
they found a beaten wiesenthal halfstarved its ok youre 
alive says an american major played by craig t nelson in the 
movie as he cradles wiesenthal in his arms yes but why 
wiesenthal asks 
the major convinces wiesenthal to help him set up a warcrimes 
unit that could use his photographic memory of the nazis who ran 
the camp 
wiesenthal is reunited with his wife cyla whom he had thought 
must have died during their sixyear separation a daughter is 
born when the us warcrimes unit is sent home wiesenthal asks 
for its files and moves his family to vienna to set up his 
nowfamous documentation center 
his wife played by dutch actress renee soutendijk wants only 
to forget he cannot we must never forget or it will happen 
again he tells her 
after a crank caller threatens to kidnap their daughter and his 
wife demands that he move the family away from viennas persistent 
manifestations of antisemitism wiesenthal says i have to do 
this i survived 
guilt at his survival translates into recurring nightmares the 
most persistent is based on a true experience wiesenthal is told 
that his mother has been rounded up by the gestapo and put on a 
train for transportation to a death camp 
he is working at the train station at that time shortly before 
he too is taken away and he goes running along the rails 
frantically banging against the doors of the locked box cars 
shouting mrs wiesenthal mrs wiesenthal 
he hears wailing and screaming from inside the cars the 
engineer stokes the furnace and the train chugs off taking his 
mother to the gas chambers 
i swear i swear i swear he shouts as he falls to the 
ground and vows to find her killers 
but its not revenge he is seeking wiesenthal tells his 
teenage daughter you musnt hate you musnt blame them all 
not even when an austrian court acquits franz murer an austrian 
officer known as the butcher of vilna for his atrocities at the 
vilna ghetto not even when he tracks down a nazi who tied two jews 
together so he could shoot one in the mouth and prove to a 
colleague that the bullet would pierce the skull of the other man 
not even when nazi sympathizers firebomb his apartment with his 
wife and daughter inside 
when i go to heaven and meet the 6 million who perished in 
the nazi holocaust wiesenthal said i want to tell them i hunted 
down their killers i didnt kill them because were better than 
they are we believe in justice

supercomputers are the lamborghinis of 
dataprocessing capable of tearing through more operations in one 
second than someone with a handheld calculator could do in several 
lifetimes 
the nation that makes the worlds fastest computers has a 
special claim to world leadership in high technology for years 
that nation has been the united states in a decade or so it may 
well be japan 
two events a week apart show how quickly japan is moving to 
surpass the united states in supercomputing 
last monday japans nec corp announced it will come out next 
year with a family of supercomputers faster than the machines that 
will be released about the same time by cray research inc the 
minneapolisbased world leader 
this monday control data corp said it was folding eta 
systems the supercomputer operation that lost more than 100 
million last year 
once again japanese companies are mounting a singleminded 
campaign to achieve superiority in a field traditionally dominated 
by americans and once again their longterm focus is paying off 
they have a onetrack mind they want to build the best so 
they find ways of doing it said sidney fernbach a consultant 
and retired director of computer operations at lawrence livermore 
national laboratory 
fernbach oversaw supercomputers at lawrence livermore that were 
used for designing nuclear weapons and experimenting with nuclear 
fusion now he chairs a supercomputing committee for the institute 
of electrical and electronics engineers 
i have no optimistic things to say about the us 
supercomputer industry i am just horrified he said in an 
interview 
disaster for us supercomputing is not imminent cray continues 
to control about twothirds of the world market by one measure 
hundreds of programs have been written to run on cray machines and 
that software will keep customers coming back 
moreover crays total reliance on supercomputers for a living 
keeps the company sharply focused on its mission 
cray has done a lot of things very very right said michael 
p burwen president of the palo alto management group consulting 
firm 
otherwise though most signs are pointing the wrong way 
japans big three nec hitachi ltd and fujitsu ltd are 
vertically integrated meaning they make everything needed for a 
supercomputer from microchips on up they can tailor chips to their 
own needs cray in contrast relies on its competitor fujitsu for 
highspeed logic chips 
japan makes much faster single processors forcing cray and 
other us companies to compete by lashing together many processors 
for cray eventually 64 making that many work together on a 
problem is diabolically difficult 
with the help of americans japanese companies are catching up 
in their one weak area software the houston area research 
consortium has become a software bonanza for nec since the 
consortium agreed to buy the only japanesemade supercomputer in 
the united states the trend is sure to continue as software 
developers adapt their programs for japanese machines 
what should be done the federal government the worlds biggest 
purchaser of supercomputers already has a buyamerican policy 
although procurement rules inhibit potentially fruitful cooperation 
between buyers and sellers 
the national science foundation backs a network of supercomputer 
centers but it is aimed more at using the machines than designing 
better ones 
it is not clear how much good an industrygovernment research 
partnership like japans 10year project would do fernbach favors 
it while burwen argues that in japan nec hitachi and fujitsu 
compete so intensely with each other that they never contributed 
their best work 
fernbach favors cultivating new us supercomputer producers by 
having government agencies in effect promise to buy their first 
machines 
besides cray and eta thinking machines corp of cambridge 
mass has sold some supercomputers and others are expected from 
evans amp sutherland computer co and amdahl corp whose largest 
shareholder is fujitsu 
the japanese most fear international business machines corp 
which leads in unit sales of supercomputers if its specially 
equipped mainframes are counted ibm is the only company that like 
the japanese is vertically intgrated from chips on up 
ibm is supporting the startup supercomputer systems inc which 
was founded by former cray designer steve chen it also is working 
with los alamos national laboratory to develop a powerful new 
supercomputer 
still fernbach for one is pessimistic i think the japanese 
are going to steal the whole computer business away from us he 
said

agonizing personal experience led linda noie to 
her fervent antiabortion stance ten years ago she had an 
abortion but still carried a fetus to term and gave birth she 
shared her private anguish over that failed abortion with the 
associated press in a story that is one in a series examining the 
emotional question of abortion rights as the us supreme court 
prepares to hear arguments this week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two months after her abortion linda noie 
feared a cancerous tumor was growing inside her but the rhythmic 
buhbump of a fetal heartbeat heard through a stethoscope confirmed 
she was still pregnant 
my tumor had a heartbeat two beautiful arms and two beautiful 
legs ms noie said 
the episode in 1979 transformed ms noie into a zealous 
prolifer now the state director of women exploited by abortion 
she lives next door to the clinic where she had the fiveminute 
surgery and pickets there at least twice a week 
her son joshua now 9 years old joins her at marches rallies 
and speeches he wears a tshirt saying i survived the abortion 
holocaust 
if that baby could make it through that terrible experience 
that baby was mine no matter what ms noie 44 said nobody 
was going to talk me into killing this baby i thought i committed 
murder one time i wasnt going to do it again 
there is a reason joshua survived i think god wanted to start 
his army in the spiritual battle against abortion he wanted 
somebody to be on the front lines here we are out on the 
battlefront 
nationally the bitter abortion fight is approaching a turning 
point 
the us supreme court will hear arguments april 26 on a 
missouri case that could narrow or overturn a 1973 ruling that 
established a womans right to abortion 
when defenders of a womans right to choose a safe legal 
abortion have marched on washington dc most recently april 9 
some have carried coat hangers as brutal reminders of backalley 
butchery done before 1973 
those opposed to abortion like ms noie counter with pictures of 
fetuses being cut up or sucked out of the womb she has yelled at 
patients and jumped in front of cars bringing pregnant women to the 
fox valley reproductive health care center where she had her 
unsuccessful abortion 
her mailbox is painted crimson and adorned with red ribbon to 
symbolize babies blood 
i dont want anyone else to get hurt like i was ms noie 
said i made a bad mistake it eats away at me every day i want 
to be there for somebody else i dont want them to look out and 
not have anybody like i did 
abortion doesnt just mean being unpregnant its legalized 
murder babies are being killed she said you just cant put 
it in a closet that door doesnt quite shut tight its going to 
creep out some day 
ms noie says shes on a crusade to help women who feel guilt or 
suffer psychological scars after their abortions dr vincent rue 
a psychotherapist and former teacher at ucla called this condition 
postabortion syndrome and said it can include suppressed 
hostility unresolved mourning for the loss of the fetal child and 
a reexperiencing of the abortion 
the way ms noie sees it the clinic either botched the abortion 
or aborted a twin fetus 
maggi case director and owner of the clinic declined to 
comment on ms noies case because she is not at liberty to 
discuss a patients medical records 
ms noie cried several times as she recounted her achingly 
private pain in a recent interview her gaze frequently drifted out 
the dining room window to a childs swing set and sandbox in the 
backyard 
in 1979 she was recently divorced after 15 years of marriage 
and had two children aged 16 and 10 a waitress she became 
pregnant to a restaurant customer who befriended her 
afraid confused and burdened with a pregnancy her boyfriend 
didnt want she scheduled an abortion at the clinic for jan 12 
the day of the surgery she wrote one word in her calendar 
diary slaughterhouse after a fivehour wait in the crowded 
clinic she spent five minutes on the operating table her 
boyfriend paid in cash 
i was mixed up i was wishing somebody would break in and take 
me out of there i wanted it stopped ms noie said the pain 
was awful it seemed very very wrong 
i killed a baby i felt so dirty and crummy it was like part 
of me was gone she said i couldnt look at myself in the 
mirror i was ready to commit suicide not because i wanted to die 
but because i hated myself so badly for what i had done 
that night she and her boyfriend ended their relationship 
ms noie returned a month later for a checkup complaining about 
being dizzy and weak at work she was told the abortion had 
removed particles of conception but her hormones hadnt 
readjusted 
on march 29 she came back again and was referred to a second 
doctor when he checked her for a suspected tumor she was given a 
stethoscope and was asked do you want to hear your babys 
heartbeat 
ms noie says her son has hearing lapses memory loss and other 
health effects that she attributes to the abortion 
she returned to the clinic about a year after joshua was born 
dressed in black she circled the stone and frame building 
touching it while joshua played with driveway pebbles 
i wanted to make sure it couldnt hurt me anymore she said 
a chainlink fence erected by the clinic marks the property line 
i had nightmares when i first moved in ms noie said i 
dreamed of little babies with charred arms and legs crawling out of 
the barrels in back where they burn their medical waste 
joshua likes the house but he tells people he lives next to 
the place where they kill babies she said once when he was 3 
years old he woke up screaming at night and said mommy why did 
you do it didnt you want me

democracy was just a word to 
paraguayans in the 34 years gen alfredo stroessner ran the 
country its something more than that now as the nation heads into 
elections may 1 but some people are still wary 
a lot of people believe we are already living a democracy but 
we say it is only a transition which began suddenly and could end 
just as suddenly says euclides acevedo president of the 
opposition revolutionary febrerista party we hope it will 
culminate in democracy 
andres rodriguez who toppled stroessner on feb 3 and became 
the provisional president has lifted restrictions on political 
parties restored civil liberties accused former government 
officials of corruption and torture allowed exiles to return 
but rodriguez like stroessner is a general who used his 
position to amass riches and act with impunity 
and he is the presidential candidate of the ruling colorado 
party which is almost certain to win the presidency and control of 
congress in the balloting 
domingo laino rodriguezs main rival for president notes that 
changes so far have come from the top not the bottom where 
farmers are clamoring for land workers for the enforcement of 
labor laws politicians for constitutional reform women for equal 
rights 
whats going to happen when people demand more than the 
government wants to give there could be a crisis laino said in 
an interview at his sprawling home where until recently he often 
was held under house arrest 
however he added im optimistic and i think the country is 
too people feel we are moving forward 
after an initial outburst of public joy paraguayans settled 
down quickly after rodriguezs coup 
victor baez mosqueiro head of the interunion movement of 
workers began pressing for labor reforms such as the right to 
strike and to join a union other than the progovernment paraguay 
workers confederation 
now that we have freedom were going to demand a raise 
teacher maria rosa marin said before we were afraid they would 
fire us 
in general paraguayans seem anxious for change not vengeance 
and are looking hopefully to the future from a past that saw 
stateofseige legislation renewed every 90 days for 32 years and 
people followed beaten up jailed and exiled 
the question is whether the colorado party can correct the 
errors committed by the colorado party i doubt it says fernando 
vera an economist and the presidential candidate of the 
revolutionary febrerista party 
asked that question edgar ynsfran stroessners onetime 
interior minister and now an adviser to rodriguez and the 
thirdranking member of the party responded im not certain 
that we do have that capacity but the good will is there 
a lot changed or at least appeared to the very morning 
rodriguez told paraguayans by radio that the 76yearold stroessner 
had resigned after allnight fighting between troops firing 
tanks shells and heavy machine guns at each other 
rodriguez 65 formed a cabinet that observers say is excellent 
he publicly endorsed human rights and invited opposition leaders 
like laino to the national palace 
the stolid stocky general now wears civilian clothes in public 
travels with few bodyguards talks with reporters without requiring 
questions to be submitted in advance seems sensitive to the 
opinions of others and plays tennis with us ambassador timothy 
towell 
paraguayans are impressed not only by the return to publication 
of the banned newspaper abc color but also by rodriguezs visit to 
a hospital that was a hotbed of opposition to stroessner and to a 
mass celebrated by a bishop who was reviled by the former 
government 
just by walking into the hospital rodriguez was saying 
they doctors and nurses were right in their struggle said jose 
carlos rodriguez no relation a 41yearold economist political 
scientist and pollster 
though photographs of rodriguez have cropped up in tourist 
hotels as well as government offices he has not sought the cult of 
personality that enveloped stroessner for whom a polka a river 
steamer a neighborhood an airport and a city were named 
stroessner was a god in paraguay said benjamin arditti a 
33yearold sociologist by toppling stroessner rodriguez also 
demonstrated that no one is god not even him and that he realizes 
that the country is not going back to where it was 
another change that paraguayans noticed and like is that 
rodriguez attends functions with his wife and daughters 
stroessner in contrast didnt live with his wife and had several 
mistresses over the years he now is in exile in brazil 
rodriguez supports family values said aldo zuccolillo 
editor of abc color 
yes the colorado party is going to win if satan 
overthrew stroessner every paraguayan would vote for the devil 
but part of the explanation however is the dominance of the 
colorado party which claims 14 million supporters requires 
membership as a condition of public employment and finances itself 
by payroll deductions 
the party also will benefit by an outofdate voter list that 
even colorados admit is bloated and by practices like the 
requirement that each party no matter how small distribute its 
own ballots to thousands of polling desks across a rural in many 
areas roadless country the size of california 
still rodriguez has a popularity that cant be denied 
i have confidence in rodriguez not just because he replaced 
stroessner said maria celeste solis an 18yearold student 
standing in line to register to vote for the first time the 
others seem disorganized to me hes more mature competent 
businessmen were won over and paraguays economy was 
stabilized when rodriguez unified the currency exchange rate 
opposition politicians decided to participate in the elections 
when rodriguez promised not to run again in 1993 endorsed 
constitutional reform reopened voter registration gave candidates 
access to the national radio network and required that voters 
fingers be dipped in indelible ink to prevent multiple voting 
rodriguez also thought to provide homes for the families of 
soldiers on both sides who died in the fighting during the coup 
he really is a man of the people said the rev mario 
melanio medina a catholic priest and frequent critic of 
stroessner when he gives his word he will try and keep it 
the diplomatic view however is wait and see 
the question is said one foreign diplomat is all this a 
political exercise or is it a reflection of something new and 
better our general view is once you unstop the bottle you cant 
put the cork back

they are part of the legacy of the 27 million 
americans who went to vietnam to help fight a war the sons and 
daughters of fathers who left years ago unwanted and scorned in 
the land of their birth many abandoned by their vietnamese 
mothers they yearn to start a new life in america us officials 
say help is on the way for the 10000 or more amerasians remaining 
in vietnam but the question is whether their fathers will welcome 
them

the war was still raging that 
day 15 years ago when vietnamese nuns heard the cries of a baby boy 
stuffed in a garbage can and took him inside their orphanage to 
raise 
today nguyen thanh binh the son of a black american who went 
home and a vietnamese mother who abandoned him shares the plight 
of thousands of amerasian youths languishing in the decay of 
vietnam desperately trying to get out and find their fathers 
my circumstances are miserable says lam anh hong 18 whose 
mother gave her away to a relative i always live with hope i 
dont give up hope 
like binh and hong many of the amerasians born of american 
fathers and vietnamese mothers were abandoned by both parents left 
in orphanages or with relatives or friends often to fend for 
themselves 
many of the amerasians are jobless homeless uneducated 
unwanted barely able to speak english they sleep at night on the 
sidewalks and in the parks some turn to prostitution to stay alive 
blacks like binh also are victims of a vietnamese caste system 
white amerasians may be at the bottom in the clannish vietnamese 
society but they are at the top within the amerasian society the 
black amerasians are at the bottom 
all suffer the taunts of their vietnamese peers amerasians no 
good go to america 
charlie brown phuong at 25 one of the older amerasians was one 
of those abandoned by their mothers she dont want i be her 
son he says 
phuong was raised in a roman catholic orphanage in da nang but 
ran away when he was 11 and boarded an evacuation ship to ho chi 
minh city as north vietnamese forces swept southward to conquer 
south vietnam in 1975 
now he sells newspapers cigarettes and bread and sleeps in a 
park nobody helps us he says look at my eyes they are 
very old because i work very hard 
but some get lucky nguyen thi thu huong an 18yearold wearing 
a blue ribbon in her brown hair and pink slippers on her mudcaked 
feet was found one day selling postcards for nickels and dimes 
washing herself in a fountain in the center of the city her father 
left vietnam when she was 2 
only foreigners help she says i feel lonely i feel sad 
i want to be in the us to study work and have friends i go i 
have a job and a good house 
then a short time later she is a cinderella on her way to 
america with her mother one hand carrying a suitcase the other 
affectionately wrapped around her 8yearold vietnamese 
halfbrother a small group of amerasian street kids went to tan 
son nhut airport to see them off 
us officials say help is also on the way for the 10000 
amerasians they estimate still remain vietnamese authorities put 
the estimate at 16000 but thats hard to pin down because no 
official census has been taken more than 6000 amerasians and 
11000 of their relatives have left vietnam legally since the start 
of the us orderly departures program in 1980 
bruce a beardsley director of the orderly departures program 
in bangkok thailand has cut much of the bureaucratic paperwork 
and persuaded the vietnamese to do the same 
i have been pushing the best i can to get departures to go at 
a much more rapid rate he says were trying to expand the 
transportation net 
at one point early this year 5500 amerasians and their family 
members already approved for resettlement in the united states were 
awaiting transportation 
some of the amerasians camp out in a park next to the foreign 
ministry awaiting the roll of the dice the anticipated approval 
that will be their ticket to america in the interim they hang out 
in front of the hotels clinging to american tourists begging not 
only for money but for affection 
some amerasians carry the physical scars of war as well as the 
mental pain of rejection 
pham thi lan 22 never knew her father her mother died of 
heart disease when she was 8 when her stepfather remarried he 
threw her out of the house and she went to live with her 
grandmother her neck and chest are scarred by napalm 
vuong thanh hai 20 has a hole in his head and only one arm 
his father left when he was born his mother died when he was 6 
shrapnel from a 155mm artillery shell cut away his right arm 
the amerasians are the legacy of some 27 million americans who 
served in vietnam until the last were withdrawn in 1973 other 
americans including military and civilian employees of the us 
embassy remained until the ussupported saigon government of 
south vietnam fell to communist north vietnam in 1975 
many amerasians and their fathers have been trying for years to 
find each other but some amerasians were rejected by fathers who 
want nothing to do with them some of the fathers already married 
went back to their american families others returned and married 
american women after the war and started new families some may be 
unaware that they left offspring behind 
but for some who do know the wrenching memories have driven 
them into post traumatic stress disorder and counseling unable to 
resolve the guilt of leaving their child in the streets

the man who runs bostons logan airport faced the 
same problem plaguing major airports worldwide how to cut the 
delays that were making flying an ever more unpleasant experience 
his solution discourage small planes from using the airport by 
raising their takeoff and landing fees while cutting the charges 
for commercial airliners 
if you think that all planes are created equal then im 
wrong says david w davis executive director of the 
massachusetts port authority but theres no way you can convince 
me that a small plane with two people aboard has the same priority 
as a large airplane with 400 
small aircraft that had paid a flat 25 to land at logan found 
themselves facing a bill for 100plus every time they set down 
jumbo jets by contrast had their 800 landing fee cut in half 
davis plan worked the number of private and commuter planes 
using the airport fell by onethird logan ranked last in ontime 
performance among the 27 biggest us airports last may surged to 
second place in the december rankings 
but the federal government disagreed with the move saying the 
new regulations violated federal aviation laws and were 
inconsistent with national transportation policy as 1988 
ended the port authority suspended its fee revisions until a 
federal appeals court hears arguments in the dispute early next 
month 
on one side are the nations air travelers and airport 
operators struggling as they are with steadily growing demands for 
limited runway space on the other private aircraft owners 
corporate plane users and commuter airlines all of which contend 
that a sixseat piper cub has the same right to use a runway as a 
400seat dc10 
airports operate like bakery counters pilots wanting to take 
off or land are all given numbers and must wait their turn and 
like the bakery customer out to buy two dozen doughnuts three 
loaves of bread and a pound of cookies but who must wait for the 
person before him to purchase his lone sticky bun pilots are all 
treated alike 
davis argues that the result of such an egalitarian policy for 
more and more people comes down to a single word wait 
wait to board the plane wait for clearance to take off wait at 
the other end for permission to land wait with other passengers 
whose trips have likewise been bollixed up for luggage for a cab 
and for the traffic on jammed highways to clear 
but critics accuse the massport director of trying to 
singlehandedly dictate transportation policy and transgressing 
longestablished laws that guarantee aircraft equal access to the 
nations runways 
john baker president of the 265000member aircraft owners and 
pilots association says eliminating all the small planes wouldnt 
cure congestion at logan what the airport really needs he says 
is another runway one set aside for private planes 
jonathan howe president of the national business aircraft 
association says that if the massport program stands other 
airports might follow with their restrictions creating chaos 
in the skies 
but even critics give davis credit for forcing a debate on 
capacity at the nations overburdened airports 
consider these facts 
air passenger traffic has doubled since jimmy carter 
deregulated airlines a decade ago in 1976 115 million people 
flew through logan by 1988 terminal traffic more than doubled to 
233 million 
requests to take off and land frequently hit 100 an hour during 
logans peak periods thats fine in good weather when the airport 
can handle 110 flights each hour but not so fine on the one day in 
five of bad weather then capacity shrinks to 80 takeoffs and 
landings an hour 
before davis restructured runway fees port authority officials 
say private and commuter planes accounted for 40 percent of 
logans takeoffs and landings but just 6 percent of passengers 
port authority officials say rushhour backups routinely hit 60 
minutes in 1987 sometime next year they project the delays may 
stretch to 100 minutes unless the number of takeoffs and landings 
falls 
to deal with these issues davis rejiggered the way runwayuse 
fees were assessed arguing that many airport costs are fixed and 
bear no relation to the size of planes using the facility 
if a cessna needs fire and crash assistance youre not going 
to send one pickup truck with a fire extinguisher he says if 
a beechcraft needs to land on a snowy day youre not going to plow 
the middle third of the runway and let it go at that 
authorities felt their logic was unassailable and noted besides 
that discouraging a single small plane from using logan could help 
speed hundreds of jumbo jet passengers on their way 
the us department of transportation felt differently 
in november a federal administrative law judge ruled that 
logans fee restructuring violated aviation laws and unfairly 
saddled small planes with a disproportionate amount of airport 
costs 
the next month deputy transportation secretary mimi w dawson 
upheld the ruling by law judge burton s kolko 
at the same time new england legislators had gotten congress to 
threaten the port authority with a cutoff of 10 million in aid 
unless the old fee structure was reimposed 
massport backed off the 25 minimum was reborn 
opponents of the plan make these arguments 
the aircraft owners and pilots association says that even 
before davis revisions private planes accounted for just 3 
percent of logans peakhours operations 
they phony up the numbers by using 24hour numbers says 
baker there are periods at logan where you can shoot a cannon 
through there and not hit an airplane 
besides he adds few pleasure flyers use airports like logan 
these days 
you put yourself in the elephant line and you suffer the same 
privations that everybody else does in the airlines because of 
irrational airline scheduling baker says 
the national business aircraft association which represents 83 
percent of the fortune 500 companies says the issue in boston is 
the right of equal access to airports and airspace 
says howe 
if youve got the chairman of the board of ibm flying into 
boston to sign an agreement to open up a major computer 
manufacturing business thats going to employ 5000 people in a 
boston suburb is it more important for him to arrive there in time 
to sign that agreement than it is to delay a load of passengers 
coming back from bermuda on vacation 
thomas champion davis assistant responds to howes argument 
by maintaining that a majority of airline passengers suffering 
lengthy delays werent charter loads of revelers on their way to 
bermuda or cub scouts going to disneyworld they were business 
travelers

always hardpressed for enough grain of its 
own the soviet union has been forced to import huge quantities 
from the united states and other countries partly because of 
sloppy harvesting and other wasteful practices 
the waste has long been an issue in the kremlin where 
generations of leaders have sought ways to offset the losses by 
boosting annual production goals last month soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev proposed a new wave of reforms 
christian j foster an agriculture department economist says 
gorbachevs proposals could bring some changes to soviet 
agriculture but their full implementation remains to be seen 
the proposed reforms were adopted by the 300member central 
committee including the reorganization of the soviet bureaucracy 
and the expansion of longterm land leasing by private individuals 
and organizations 
other reforms which are to be worked out in the coming year 
include changes in the procurement prices for seasonal farm 
products decentralizing agricultural planning and increasing 
investments in rural areas 
meanwhile according to usda estimates the soviet unions grain 
stockpile in 1988 and 1989 will decline for the first time in seven 
years 
poor harvesting storage processing and transportation 
practices cause substantial soviet grain losses foster said 
now the soviets are increasing efforts to cut these losses 
foster writing in the current issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said that it has been virtually impossible for even 
soviet leaders to determine accurate grain supply and demand 
statistics 
one reason for inaccuracies has been the traditional soviet 
practice of reporting grain output on the basis of bunker 
weight which includes excess moisture and foreign materials or 
dockage such as weeds soil and pebbles 
foster said a soviet newspaper in may 1988 charged that the 
time has come for the leaders of the agroindustrial complex to 
restructure this strange procedure and to stop deceiving both 
themselves and us 
the kremlin last summer published for the first time information 
about the excess moisture and dockage in state grain procurements 
the government also announced that grain production figures would 
be available on a cleanweight basis this may he said 
losses to the 1988 soviet grain harvest which was reported by 
moscow at 195 million metric tons were estimated by usda at 11 
percent or 22 million tons the big 1987 harvest of 2114 million 
tons had dockage and waste losses of 14 percent or 30 million tons 
foster said the 1988 estimate reflects reduced grain output 
greater care in handling and dry harvesting conditions last 
season 
but the losses appear to be endemic in the current production 
system according to the noted soviet economist nikolai shmelev 
every year the soviet union loses as much as 25 percent of its 
grain due to poor harvesting practices bad processing and 
storage and transport difficuties 
foster said a lack of drying facilities partly accounts for the 
excessive moisture in soviet grain crops and even in dry 
weather the short growing season in the siberian regions often 
does not permit plants to dry out before harvest 
according to one authority he said a huge part of the soviet 
grain area is not harvested quickly enough resulting in yearly 
losses of 17 million to 20 million tons another authority said 
that if the harvest could be shortened by only a week or 10 days 
yields could be boosted enough to produce an additional 30 million 
to 40 million tons 
foster said the soviet unions use of grain as livestock feed 
continues to rise to record levels reflecting the governments 
desire to boost the output of meat poultry and dairy products 
but the soviets are trying to do this by increasing yields per 
animal while deemphasizing growth in animal numbers however he 
said there is reportedly much overfeeding of grains to livestock 
because of a lack of proper balance in animal rations 
for example the share of grain in mixed livestock feed produced 
by the state was reported at 684 percent in 1988 comparatively 
the grain share in us and west european mixed feeds is around 45 
percent which use much higher proportions of protein supplements 
soviet specialists report that at least 50 million to 60 
million tons of all grain used for feed in the socialized sector is 
fed nearly straight or only coarsely ground foster said they 
estimate that if properly balanced with oilmeals and other 
additives grain use could be reduced 16 million to 18 million tons 
a year 
furthermore he said improved livestock rations could free a 
significant amount of highquality wheat for human consumption 
a muchpublicized move to restrict vodka production has not had 
much effect on total grain consumption according to usdas 
estimates the soviet unions total use of grain for industrial 
purposes in 198889 will be unchanged from the five million tons 
consumed in 198788 
although production of alcohol from grain may decrease the 
use of grain in nonalcoholic beverages likely will increase 
foster said output of vodka in 1987 the latest year available 
fell another 16 percent to its lowest level in 31 years reflecting 
the gorbachev strategy aimed at curbing alcohol consumption

the quest for profit in an increasingly 
competitive medical industry is having an impact on the kind and 
quality of medical treatment we receive in this second article in 
an intermittent series the business of medicine science 
writer daniel q haney and national writer fred bayles look at how 
walkin clinics have changed the everyday practice of medicine 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
working at a hospital emergency 
room in 1975 dr robert gordon sensed a business opportunity amid 
the bad backs and twisted ankles he saw each day 
the vast majority of cases didnt need to be seen in a 
hospital these were the people with cuts and bruises who were 
waiting for hours said the lanky practitioner it seemed as 
though something else would work better 
gordons notion was simple a private clinic where people could 
walk in without an appointment see a doctor without a long wait 
and walk out without a big bill 
fourteen years after gordon started what is considered the first 
walkin clinic on a north providence shopping strip his idea has 
been copied by giant health corporations bigcity medical centers 
community hospitals and individual doctors 
along the way it has helped change the way many doctors work 
and become one of the most visible examples of a quiet 
transformation in american medicine the subtle evolution of 
health care from a calling to a business 
the mythical almost saintly family doctor the kindly dispenser 
of compassion and prescriptions is being replaced by 9to5 
employees of large health enterprises and by entrepreneurs who 
generate income by ordering tests on their diagnostic machines and 
by selling drugs they prescribe 
everywhere you look you see forprofit corporations providing 
health care in this climate doctors start considering themselves 
businessmen because they are treated as businessmen said dr 
arnold relman editor of the new england journal of medicine and 
perhaps the nations most vocal critic of corporate medicine 
although by no means the only symptom of medicine as business 
the walkins have been a lightning rod for those who pine for a 
return to medicine as they remember it they criticize these 
businesses for their inandout nohandholding brand of treatment 
and for what they sense is an unseemly concern for the bottom line 
one of our tenets is continuity of care the same doctor 
seeing the same patient over time is much more efficient and 
effective said dr jim jones president of the american academy 
of family physicians at walkin clinics that principle is being 
violated 
while they have invited unflattering comparisons with hamburger 
chains and muffler franchises they are often called 
docintheboxes these clinics have changed the way doctors work 
many private practitioners now keep longer hours and hang out 
signs offering walkin service to attract new patients and keep old 
ones hospitals have opened quickcare annexes to their emergency 
wards and put their own storefront clinics downtown to serve as 
magnets to attract patients to fill their empty beds 
at least 4000 walkin clinics operate nationwide last year 50 
million patients paid them 25 billion to sooth minor aches and 
ills their financial success however has been less than 
stunning many who got into the enterprise learned that fast 
medicine like fast food needs high volume to survive and there 
simply were not enough broken arms and bruised noggins to go around 
most analysts agree clinics must see 30 to 40 patients a day 
seven days a week to stay out of the red 
the people who use these services dont necessarily come back 
because they arent the sorts who want a regular sort of 
medicine said regina herzlinger a harvard business school 
professor and an expert on the business of health care 
to make the practice viable you had to always bring in new 
recruits and thats a very expensive way of doing any business 
she said 
gordon and his early imitators initially billed themselves as 
emergency or urgent care centers to emphasize their similarity to 
the emergency room but hospital administrators and doctors in 
private practice complained that people with heart attacks or 
serious injuries might mistake these shops for true emergency rooms 
and die for their error 
the early walkin clinics were also viewed as money machines 
business people fell in love with the idea without realizing 
the problems said chicago surgeon bruce flashner who opened one 
clinic after another starting in 1979 
humana inc the hospital chain bought flashners 20 units for 
17 million in 1985 and eventually operated 150 medfirst clinics 
around the country 
for most of the major franchise operators however the bubble 
burst 
owners found they couldnt pull in enough patients and money to 
cover the startup costs of 300000 to 500000 and high salaries 
for doctors and nurses many clinics folded or were sold humana 
closed or sold off its entire clinic operation writing off 40 
million 
despite the shakeout the industry continues to grow many of 
the newest outposts are operated by hospitals which often view 
them more as marketing tools than money makers and despite the 
condescending attitude of many health professionals toward these 
clinics they have no trouble attracting doctors 
most young physicians finish residency training with crushing 
debts they need jobs and cannot afford to buy established 
practices or start new ones however many like gordon simply 
prefer clinic medicine 
i dont like getting involved with patients he said i 
dont like long protracted following of cases seeing people over 
the years and making little adjustments in their medication i like 
to see them and send them along 
walkins are far cheaper than emergency rooms but with base 
fees ranging from 30 to 50 they are often more expensive than 
traditional office doctors 
their success also depends on billing for more than the standard 
office visit fee 
you need other revenue generators like xrays and testing 
said nancy kane an assistant professor of management at the 
harvard school of public health who has studied the industry 
some doctors who have worked for a number of walkin clinics 
complain they are pressured or paid to do tests that may not be 
necessary a claim clinic officials deny 
health stop now the nations largest chain with 112 units 
encourages its doctors to think of the clinic as their private 
practice and to get patients to return for blood sugar checks high 
blood pressure consultations and other standard care 
sometimes i think were reinventing the private practice 
said dr joseph maloney health stops executive vice president 
linda douglas a physician at an oak brook ill health stop 
unit has seen shifting philosophies as owners changed in her three 
years as a walkin clinic doctor today she says some 80 percent of 
the people she sees are regular patients 
initially the gist of the thing was we just want to see 
patients once she recalled now youve got to have doctors 
build a practice and if i dont deliver quality care to my 
patients theyre not going to come back

in 1973 when the supreme court issued the roe 
vs wade decision that legalized abortion the fate of babies born 
more than two months premature was simple 
they died almost invariably 
in the 16 years since that court decision advances in treatment 
have lowered the age of viability for premature infants by a full 
month 
human beings who at birth are smaller than a persons palm and 
weigh just over a pound now are nurtured by an arsenal of 
equipment drugs and skills that didnt exist in 1973 
now babies born in major hospitals after only 24 weeks of 
gestation have a fighting chance to survive flourish and go home 
thus if certain conditions are met some abortions still may be 
performed on fetuses with a potential for viability outside the 
womb forcing hospitals clinics and doctors to make rending 
decisions that touch the very heart of the abortion controversy 
maureen c edwards a physician who specializes in treating 
premature babies at george washington university hospital believes 
that in many cases the lines have merged 
the therapeutic abortions are being performed within a range 
that we might have a viable baby said dr edwards such 
abortions usually folow prenatal tests such as amniocentesis that 
detect some genetic abnormality in the infant she said but some 
abortions at the edge of the second trimester are performed for the 
convenience of the mother 
there are places that will terminate at 23 or 24 weeks said 
dr edwards it is part of the problem 
the supreme court is hearing arguments wednesday on a missouri 
case in which the justices are being asked to overturn or 
substantially limit the landmark roe vs wade decision legalizing 
abortion among the issues before the court is a regulation that 
requires doctors in some cases to determine whether the fetus is 
viable if such a determination is made the regulation says the 
doctor must perform the abortion in a way best designed to preserve 
fetal life 
an infant brought into the world after only 24 weeks of 
gestation faces an awesome struggle to survive theres not a 
single organ in the babys body that is yet ready to live unaided 
outside the womb the lungs heart brain liver and digestive 
system all are only partially formed all of the blood in the body 
of such a baby equals only about three tablespoons 
the lungs are usually the organs most threatened by early birth 
in many cases the air sacs have yet to develop the blood vessels 
needed for the body to absorb oxygen from inhaled air 
a critical substance surfactant is also missing this sudsy 
protein which a fetus usually develops in about the 30th week 
keeps the lungs from collapsing between breaths its absence often 
leads to respiratory distress and death 
in many cases a premature infants brain is not yet ready to 
support life and is unable to control breathing and other automatic 
body processes 
often the preemies heart valves and vessels are still 
unfinished and not functioning well 
and almost invariably the babies are unable to take food by 
mouth a factor that for decades meant death 
the rule was if they cant take food by gut then they 
died recalled dr edwards 
in 1973 size alone could determine fate premature infants were 
microcreatures in a macroworld of medicine that was unable to 
cope with miniscule needs 
needles were too large for veins almost as fine as human hair 
breathing machines overpowered fragile lungs medicine or nutrition 
could not be delivered in the precise fractional measure needed 
some babies actually drowned when health care workers attempted to 
feed or medicate them using intravenous gravity drips 
but the doctors and nurses kept trying and learning mistakes 
that cost lives in 1973 became knowledge that saves lives today 
catheters small enough for the infants were made and became 
common in nurseries engineers developed a micropump that splits a 
daily dose of liquid nutrition or medicine into fractional ounces 
and delivers the precise amount drop by drop through the 
catheters to the small struggling humans 
nutritionists learned how to feed babies by needle helped by 
the micropumps to deliver the exact balance of sugar fat and 
protein in small doses 
new ventilators were developed to deliver air to incubators at 
the exact pressure temperature and humidity needed for tiny lungs 
medical workers began to recognize that it was possible to save 
these small humans and the challenge attracted new talents doctors 
and nurses who might have chosen other types of medicine now worked 
with premature infants in the nursery 
the possibility of intervention brings more people into the 
field said dr charlotte catz of the national institute of child 
care and human development a part of the national institutes of 
health the passive observer is not a very exciting thing 
all of these factors worked together to slowly drop the 
viability age to 24 weeks 
there hasnt been a single breakthrough but more a 
refinement said ernest n kraybill a neonatal expert on the 
faculty at the university of north carolina school of medicine 
theres been a refinement of both our technology and our ability 
to use it on very small babies were now having the results with 
700gram babies that we once had with 1200gram babies 
the survival rate at the limit of viability now less than 50 
percent may improve soon when researchers perfect an artificial 
surfactant the protein that helps the lungs absorb oxygen the new 
drug is now being tested in selected hospitals and appears to be 
successful in relieving some respiratory problems of the premature 
but experts dont expect the age of viability for preemies to 
ever drop below 24 weeks 
in most species premature babies just dont live premature 
puppies dont live premature sheep dont live said dr edwards 
there is a natural limit 
i think we are at the limit now said dr maria 
delivoiapapadopoulos chief of perinatal services at the 
university of pennsylvania hospital below 24 weeks the whole 
system brain lungs heart is not developed enough 
more and more doctors also are questioning whether society 
should push for survival below 24 weeks 
by some estimates it takes about 1 million dollars to assure 
just a years survival for a baby born three months premature and 
nearly all such children require later medical care to correct 
problems of prematurity 
when you think about the tremendous cost for that purpose 
and contrast it with all the simple inexpensive things that need 
to be done for bigger babies with better prospects of survival 
such as immunization it suggests that we maybe shouldnt be 
investing resources into such extremely high technology for a tiny 
group of babies with such poor prospects said kraybill 
keeping 23week babies alive may not be an appropriate national 
priority

this is one of those movies that everybody avoided because all

cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death paramount 
home video vhs 7995 beta 2995 rated pg13 
 
theres an imaginary jungle stretching from bakersfield calif 
to the mexican border this is where all the avocados grow it also 
is where the ancient amazon commune of maneating piranha women 
live as well as the dreaded barracuda women 
if you can buy all of that then youll have no trouble with 
cannibal women in the avocado jungle of death or maybe you 
will because the movie is stupid and silly no matter how you look 
at it 
it takes a stab at some sort of backwards humor about feminism 
and male chauvinism but its merely pretentious and not very funny 
adrienne barbeau plays a talk show anthropolgist whose lines 
read like something out of junior high school when shes fencing 
with margo hunt shannon tweed a feminism instructor she 
congratulates herself on her good form and says i learned in the 
ancient weaponry course at berkeley 
later when she throws herself into a seething piranha pit she 
says you dont know how degrading it is to be on the david 
letterman show i cant go back to that 
the acting is as wooden as the actors 
bad jokes abound so do misadventures as margo bunny karen 
mistral and jim bill maher a clumsy indiana jonestype enter 
the jungle to save the free worlds supply of avocados and the 
pickers from the voracious females 
but theres a happy ending the bad guys are defeated and the 
piranha women and the barracuda women unite and live happily ever 
after in the jungle protected as a primitive culture 
oh in case you need to know the prime difference between the 
two groups is that the piranhas tear their men into strips like 
beef jerky and eat them with guacamole dip while the barrcudas 
insist on clam dip

symphony no 29 in a major k 201 symphony no 39 in e flat 
major k 543 berlin philharmonic orchestra conducted by herbert 
von karajan deutsche grammaphon 
 
one way to take your mozart is like coffee light and sweet 
herbert von karajan tends more towards dark no sugar in this 
recording of two mozart symphonies no 29 one of the composers 
first great symphonies and no 39 from the final troika of 
masterpieces 
what a marvelous sleek machine the berlin philharmonic is like 
a lustrous mercedesbenz sedan it glides through symphonies the 
orchestras character is that it needs no character because its 
sheer sound is so perfect karajan the aging potentate of european 
music brings slow tempos some beautiful effects and a weighty 
intensity that occasionally borders on the plodding 
the a major symphony written by the 17yearold mozart has one 
of the most marvelous openings of his symphonies an inviting 
mysterious murmur in the strings the andante is a serenade played 
lovingly by the berlin strings karajan elicits an appropriately 
courtly dance quality to the third movement menuetto the orchestra 
brings clarity and spirit to the churning final allegro con spirito 
the highlight of the disc comes in the adagio introduction of 
the e flat symphony karajan and his forces are at their best 
bringing an expansiveness and tautness to this grandiose operatic 
section the clarinets which take the place of oboes in this 
symphony have some lovely melodies in loud passionate passages of 
the second movement karajan sometimes errs on the side of the 
plodding when trying to sound intense in another section 
successive woodwind entrances sound beautiful but aimless 
on the basis of the second movement its no surprise that the 
minuet sounds a little relentless the jaunty final allegro lacks a 
little in jaunt fast passages are clean but lifeless 
this disc is a thing of beauty but for listeners who want more 
interesting recent mozart symphonic issues consider recordings by 
sir charles mackerras and the prague chamber orcehstra on telarc

the raw amp the cooked mca fine young cannibals 
 
there are dozens and dozens of bands out there making 
nondescript electronic pop music some of its pleasant enough but 
most fades quickly from memory 
those bands dont have a voice what sets fine young cannibals 
apart is a gift lead singer roland gift to be precise 
roland gift is the vocalist exenglish beat members andy cox 
guitars and david steele keyboards and bass found singing for a 
british rampb band in a london pub together they formed fine young 
cannibals in 1985 
on the raw amp the cooked fine young cannibals second album 
gift shifts from breathy falsetto to raw wrenching yells to a 
lower register that sounds as if his throat is lined with oak 
the result is a remarkable vocal performance not heard since the 
death of otis redding to whom gift is often compared 
the raw amp the cooked is above all a fun record you can 
dance to the bright guitar hook of she drives me crazy while 
the hit good thing and another tune its ok its alright 
are both rampb numbers made to move you 
theres straight guitarbased rock n roll on dont look 
back which showcases andy coxs ringing style reminiscent of 
early beatles or byrds 
but back to the gift two songs if played back to back 
demonstrate his incredible vocal range 
im not the man i used to be is a gripping ballad that finds 
gift pleading with a woman to stay with him even though hes weak 
and on as hard as it is gift takes his voice way down low to 
show strength in the face of adversity 
fine young cannibals is a fine young band with a possibly great 
lead singer the tunes are catchy and intelligent if a bit 
overelectronic 
if only the group had a drummer instead of a drum machine to put 
a floor under it all but whos complaining

sunshine on leith chrysalis the proclaimers 
 
garage rock meets celtic folk music in an edinburgh pub and the 
result is this jaunty album from the proclaimers twin brothers 
charlie and craig reid have written a collection of songs that 
would sound best live in a crowded smoky tavern 
the simple arrangements and spare production of this record come 
close to capturing that sound nothing artificial here or at 
least it sounds as though each song might have been recorded in one 
take 
the politics of frustration are heard in what do you do and 
cap in hand i cant understand why we let someone else rule 
our land but the more common theme is love conquering sorrow 
then i met you im on my way oh jean and come on 
nature is a delightfully honest expression of sexual desire i 
just want to spend some time being boy to the girl 
the reid brothers and their band have made good use of varied 
influences including a touch of american country but a distinctly 
scottish sound comes through not only in their accents but in the 
stomping beat of many of their songs and as oh jean builds to 
its finish the words i love her i love her are sung over and 
over like the drone note of a bagpipe 
the lyrics are unsophisticated sometimes even trite the vocals 
rough and throaty the tables and chairs are of bare wood the 
floor is grimy and the light is bad faded photographs and flags 
hang from the well you get the picture

samuel goldwyn never read wuthering heights 
but that didnt stop him from producing the classic film with 
laurence olivier and merle oberon 
he knew little about baseball but still insisted on making 
pride of the yankees the story of lou gehrig 
he always referred to lillian hellmans play the little 
foxes as the three little foxes and he fought with warner 
bros to allow bette davis to star in the movie 
for goldwyn one of hollywoods most celebrated and colorful 
producers what mattered was a good story especially one that 
could make him cry 
he was deeply drawn to people films to emotional subjects 
said a scott berg author of goldwyn a biography 2495 
knopf an extensive biography of the film mogul his serious 
films have great emotional moments in them i think he poured all 
his bottledup emotions into those movies 
goldwyns own life had all the drama of his best films he was 
born schmuel gelbfisz in 1879 the son of a struggling warsaw 
antique dealer the young gelbfisz had no desire to remain with his 
impoverished family leaving by foot at age 16 with a vow to go to 
america and never return 
he boarded a passenger ship in liverpool late in 1898 goldwyn 
later claimed that upon reaching the united states on new years 
day 1899 he kissed the ground calling himself samuel goldfish 
the young immigrant found work in upstate new york as a glovemaker 
and eventually became a salesman earning enough money to buy a 
brownstone on manhattans upper west side 
on a muggy afternoon in 1913 his life changed forever goldfish 
left his fifth avenue office and headed uptown when he reached 
34th street he decided to check out the flickers at the herald 
square theater 
like adolph zukor louis b mayer and other immigrants goldfish 
instantly saw the potential of moving pictures and decided he 
wanted to be part of a whole new exciting world 
in 1916 he and theater producer edgar selwyn formed goldwyn 
pictures goldfish later adapted the companys name for himself 
selwyn dropped out and goldwyn went on to produce movies for more 
than 40 years 
goldwyn saw the movies as a medium by which he could invent 
this character called goldwyn berg said how could you be 
the great goldwyn making gloves i think he saw he could have a 
universal stamp 
the universal stamp what the producer would call the goldwyn 
touch was a series of powerful dramas such as wuthering 
heights dodsworth and the 1946 academy awardwinner the 
best years of our lives movies that brought tears to the eyes 
of millions of moviegoers especially goldwyn 
he brought his emotions into those movies berg said not 
just making them but watching them thats part of the key to his 
success as a filmmaker when he watched them he became an 
audience 
instead of using the sophisticated market research todays 
studio businessmen employ goldwyn just followed his heart 
if he cried it worked berg said when he saw the 
birthday sequence of stella dallas for the first time when no 
one shows up for her daughters birthday he wept and wept and 
wept then he saw the end when stellas out there in the rain and 
is pushed along by a policeman he sobbed everytime he saw the 
movie 
wuthering heights best years the little foxes and 
dodsworth were all directed by william wyler with whom goldwyn 
had a relationship best compared to that of new york yankee owner 
george steinbrenner and manager billy martin 
again and again the two stubborn immigrants fought with the 
director vowing never to work for goldwyn and the producer becoming 
enraged over wylers fondness for numerous retakes 
they both wanted the same thing as wyler told me time and 
again the author said they fought about how to make a picture 
better they were artistic fights 
goldwyns films may have made people cry but the producers 
mangling of the english language was a source of great amusement 
everyone in hollywood had a favorite goldwynism when warned 
that the little foxes was a caustic play goldwyn snapped 
back i dont give a damn how much it costs buy it he would 
back out of uncomfortable situations by insisting include me 
out 
while the filmmaker once groaned to his analyst i hate my 
mouth berg insisted that even goldwyn was amused by his 
malapropisms 
i think he reached a point where he realized just how charming 
they were his analyst would assure him that they were endearing 
people werent laughing at him they loved him for them it aint 
bad being in walter winchells column every day 
goldwyn died in 1974 outlasting nearly all his contemporaries 
as berg noted while mayer zukor and the other moguls were 
eventually kicked upstairs goldwyn remained his own boss 
i think the crucial theme is survival berg said goldwyn 
was front and center all that time he always worked against the 
tide he figured it may be tougher swimming but in the end hell 
get there

most scions of hollywoods founding fathers 
guard the family archives as if they were cia files but samuel 
goldwyn jr gave total access to his fathers biographer a scott 
berg 
i felt it was the only way i could attract a firstclass 
biographer said the younger goldwyn himself the head of a 
prosperous film company its a gamble you take 
my father said he wanted an honest book i took him at his 
word im not sure if he were alive that he would want it quite so 
honest i think that it is on the whole an honest biography when 
someone gives you 8 years of his life to do this book as scott 
did you have to take that chance 
why did it take so long to research and write goldwyn a 
biography knopf 2495 
research research research the 39yearold author said 
i was given access to a real treasure trove of material 
basically 50 years of hollywood history none of which anyone had 
ever gone through so it was all there for the first time 
i immediately realized that with this material i could tell 
the whole history of hollywood so i wanted to interview as many 
people as i could from the various eras that were included i 
interviewed about 250 people of whom 60 are dead now 
goldwyn and berg were interviewed at the century city offices of 
the goldwyn co young sam operates in his own manner building his 
company with smaller films and foreign releases hes now branching 
out with bigname movies such as stella with bette midler 
goldwyn appears to have escaped the soulnumbing later life that 
has afflicted many sons of the pioneers how 
i had a very strong father but i also had one who taught me 
that the most important thing is to survive he said if 
theres any one message in this book its about survival human 
survival in hollywood 
berg added if sam goldwyn was not the most interesting of 
hollywood producers he was certainly the most quintessential i 
thought his life would be the most interesting lens through which i 
could tell the whole history of the movies 
what sustained me throughout was that i genuinely admired him 
for the career he put together were all dealt a hand at birth 
and i think he was dealt a lousy one a lot of twos threes and 
fours no picture cards 
there he was in poland at the height of the pogroms his 
family situation he was not crazy about his father died while he 
was very young and he was responsible for the support of his 
mother and five siblings pretty awful nothing going for him 
except this enormous drive enormous energy enormous will to 
survive 
like many immigrants in the early century he was drawn to the 
movie business he joined with jesse lasky and cecil b demille to 
produce one of hollywoods first features the squaw man but 
goldwyn could never tolerate partners and he soon launched his own 
company 
many people thought the producer was part of 
metrogoldwynmayer not so he had sold his interest in his 
company which kept the goldwyn name by the time it merged with 
louis b mayers studio and the metro co 
as an independent the samuel goldwyn co produced an 
astonishing number of classics stella dallas dodsworth 
dead end wuthering heights the little foxes the 
pride of the yankees the best years of our lives guys and 
dolls his last movie was a disappointing adaptation of the 
broadway hit porgy and bess in 1958 
goldwyn suffered a stroke in 1969 and died in 1974 at age 94 
the samuel goldwyn co dissolved sam jrs firm the goldwyn co 
was an entirely new enterprise but it did retain the original 
goldwyn film catalog 
berg who wrote the acclaimed max perkins editor of genius 
covers it all and provides a few surprises the major one the 
great love in the life of frances goldwyn sams wife was director 
george cukor my fair lady 
despite mrs goldwyns deep feelings the relationship was 
platonic since cukor was a homosexual nevertheless mrs goldwyn 
arranged for cukor to be buried at forest lawn alongside herself 
her husband and her mother

the first sale fernando botero ever 
made was in his hometown of medellin colombia back in the late 
1940s he was a 15yearold who amused himself by doing watercolors 
of bullfights and matadors 
more than 40 years later botero is an internationally famous 
painter who has returned to the fiesta brava of the bullfight but 
dont expect blood and sand and moments of truth his chubby 
bullfighters parade around the ring with smiles of anticipation 
and even the dignified picadors have the air of a sunday outing 
a courtly 57 botero considers himself a completely latin 
american artist although it would be hard to find reallife 
counterparts of his voluptously overweight prostitutes and children 
anywhere on the continent 
or for that matter of his famous selfportrait with louis xiv 
with a tiny botero in a business suit next to an impressively 
rotund monarch in full regalia 
my painting is based on latin america its what i know 
best he says i could never paint a north american subject 
for instance i dont see myself painting george washington 
of course what you see in my paintings you wont find in 
colombia one captures the essence it is not a matter of standing 
in front of reality and painting a picture postcard im a painter 
not an illustrator 
botero was in caracas to inaugurate at the museo de arte 
contemporaneo a showing of 100 drawings and oil paintings on 
bullfighting 
my uncle joaquin was a fanatic aficionado and he would take 
me to the plaza to see the best toreadors from spain and mexico 
manolete el cordobes and dominguin all the best ones came to 
medellin during the winter when the season is over in europe my 
uncle was such a fanatic he wanted me to be a matador too so he 
enrolled me in a school in medellin 
botero never became a toreador much less a matador the highest 
grade of toreador he was not a success at the medellin bull 
fighting school and still recalls the terror he felt when he faced 
his first and only bull however he liked the colorful spectacle 
and when he began painting at the age of 14 started with 
watercolors of the corridas and the picadors horseback riders who 
direct the bull with long lances or picas 
there was a craftsman who had a workshop near the bull ring 
where he sold tickets for the corridas says botero in the 
introduction he wrote for the exhibits catalog one day he saw 
my watercolors and he said give them to me ill put them in the 
window and maybe someone will buy when they buy tickets and that 
is how i sold my first paintings 
this was before he was expelled from a jesuitrun high school 
for writing an article on picasso and nonconformism in art for 
the local newspaper 
critics always use the word humor to describe a botero 
painting but botero himself is dead serious about his work and 
sees himself as a pioneer for bringing back volume to modern 
art 
in the 1960s and 60s when he was living in new york he had 
the courage to try something different in spite of the absolute 
dictatorship of abstract art to go against current fashions and 
what my friends and fellow artists were doing the history of 
painting is the history of those who dare to paint differently 
his technique is painstaking building up layers and layers of 
paint trying to imitate as much as possible the richness and depth 
of the italian quattrocento the period he most admires 
painting he says is very much like cooking you keep 
adding ingredients you like a touch of this a touch of that a 
touch of humor until you get what you want 
he believes all his fellow latin american artists should travel 
and visit museums and galleries abroad and not stay at home out of 
misguided patriotism its not just that travel broadens the mind 
he says its a matter of keeping up standards if an artist 
doesnt measure himself against real quality he stagnates and 
grows soft 
botero lives in bogota most of the time with his second wife 
the sculptor sophia vari but spends at least a few months every 
year in paris or new york 
as famous as his work is one painting is renowned throughout 
latin america his official portrait of the military junta 
1971 gathers every single cliche about the military 
dictatorships that have haunted latin america 
there they are the man on horseback the moustachioed colonel 
dripping medals the mistress with her mink stoles 
stripped by botero of all power to terrify they gaze out of the 
frame fat pink and ridiculous

as a quaker bonnie raitt has devoted long hours 
to the cause of world peace once she straps a guitar around her 
shoulder however the gloves come off 
equally adept at singing hard rockers and soulful ballads she 
emphasized in a recent interview that at 39 she does not intend to 
mellow with age 
her new album nick of time contains music worthy of such 
titles as i will not be denied real man and i aint 
gonna let you break my heart again 
if anybody had any doubts about how i feel they can just 
listen to those three songs i will not be denied is the 
strongest statement on what i feel about love at the moment the 
songs are cathartic and i will be not denied i will get what i 
deserve when you get beat up you eventually stop taking it 
the past decade has been difficult for raitt warner bros her 
longtime record label dropped her in 1983 refusing to release the 
album she had just completed for three years contractual 
difficulties forced her to tour without a band for the last two 
years and she had to overcome a drinking problem 
but her luck has begun to change when producer hal wilner put 
together an album of disney songs last year he paired raitt with 
don was of was not was on baby mine from the dumbo 
soundtrack raitt and was became fast friends and he ended up 
producing nick of time released on capitol records 
the albums 11 songs include covers of john hiatt and jerry l 
williams as well as two raitt compositions 
i wanted to make it a roots stripped down record she said 
it was an easily accomplished well thought out very smooth 
album the best recording situation ive ever had 
raitt the daughter of broadway singer john raitt was born in 
los angeles and quickly became interested in music learning folk 
songs at summer camp 
all the counselors were from colleges that were experiencing a 
folk music revival being a little 10yearold impressionable kid 
i idolized my counselors i completely bought into bob dylans 
lyrics as seriously as the rest of america but i was a little 
kid 
joan baez was also an early favorite 
she killed me when i was a kid she was quaker also i wanted 
so badly to have long hair and be thin id look in the mirror and 
wonder when i was going to get cheekbones 
raitts musical interests broadened as a teenager she would 
listen to early rock n roll and soul music and began a lifetime 
passion for blues after entering radcliffe college in 1967 
through the college radio station i met dick waterman who 
managed big boy crudup and mississippi john hurt and had helped 
rediscover son house we became really good friends and through him 
i met all those blues guys i got to travel carry their things for 
them and got to know all of them and watch them play 
i was a complete blues nut but i never expected to do this for 
a living i just kind of played as a hobby then one day i needed 
to make some money and a girl was playing at a club i knew i was 
at least as good as her 
raitts first two albums bonnie raitt and give it up 
came out in the early 1970s and showed her love of jazz soul 
blues folk and rock she covered songs by the marvelettes stephen 
stills jackson browne and blues singer sippie wallace another 
major influence 
although just in her early 20s raitt showed surprising depth 
and confidence tackling the complex emotional themes of love has 
no pride and too long at the fair 
people call and say the songs have really touched them that a 
song has gotten them through a difficult period or they met their 
boyfriends through my show you either touch people or you dont 
and if youre lucky you get to do it for a living 
she used a variety of producers in the 70s including paul 
rothchild and peter asher who also worked with linda ronstadt and 
james taylor 
i basically produce myself raitt said i pick the songs 
with the collaboration of the producer the producers a partner 
another set of ears its a voice of rationality when i get too 
emotionally involved you need to have a partner in there 
because its a lot of pressure 
her political and musical interests merged in 1979 when she 
helped organize the celebrated muse musicians united for safe 
energy concerts at madison square garden she continues to help 
with a variety of causes including the antiapartheid movement in 
south africa and the campaign against deforestation in the amazon 
jungle 
i used to go to peace marches and civil rights marches when i 
was a kid i stuffed envelopes when i was 11 i first picked up the 
guitar when i was a little kid because bob dylan and joan baez were 
singing protest songs at peace marches 
justice is justice whether its between a man and a woman or 
a guy and his dog 
raitt concludes nick of time with an original song the 
roads my middle name a bluesy stomp that reaffirms her 
dedication to music 
i never pretended to be a great artist or a great 
originator she said im just an interpreter of good music if 
my voice and guitar playing sensibility of putting together a 
band and arrangement of songs appeals to a certain group of 
people then all i need is enough fans to allow me to pay the 
musicians

through the 446 pages of margaret atwoods new 
novel cats eye characters help each other hurt each other 
grow up get jobs marry have children divorce some even die 
and the books narrator elaine risley actually forgets events 
depicted at the beginning of the story 
atwood author of the acclaimed best seller the handmaids 
tale has always been interested in the process of time 
accelerating it slowing it even freezing it like a still picture 
i think its why people write time travel stories said 
atwood one of canadas best known writers i remember being 
quite riveted by hg wells time machine 
cats eye doubleday 1895 is one of the authors most 
personal novels elaine is a middleaged canadian painter returning 
to her hometown of toronto for an exhibit of her work 
several of the events described in cats eye come from 
atwoods own life 
like atwood elaine lived for several years in the canadian 
wilderness as a child had a freespirited mother and a father who 
was an entomologist given to expounding theories about the fate of 
the world while atwood has resented being too closely identified 
with the characters of her previous stories she doesnt hesitate 
to agree that she and elaine have much in common 
its wonderful material great material how could i not use 
it when things you found so interesting and wonderful are gone 
you want to know they exist somewhere so you put them in a book 
the novels title refers to a blue marble that elaine first 
acquires as a child and manages to hold onto throughout her life 
while everything else in cats eye is affected by the passage 
of time the marble remains unchanged a tangible reminder of 
elaines childhood 
i think we all remember through objects a lot atwood said 
we remember a lot through smells but i think we remember a great 
deal through items in our lives 
if its a city we remember through landmarks whenever you 
see those things you remember something in your life a lot of 
things are remembered through popular songs there are some songs 
in the book as well all of those things i think are keys to 
memory 
cats eye is closer in style and content to earlier novels 
such as life before man and lady oracle than to the 
handmaids tale which imagines life in a country run by 
rightwing extremists as atwood explained she had little concern 
about following up such a popular book 
i always just go along in my own way im a writer who got 
popular by accident ive always written literary books and ill 
continue to write them 
i think its very nice that i have a large audience but that 
wasnt the general idea i think every once in a while someone 
comes along like an el doctorow who somehow clicks into 
something 
she admitted to having doubts about the handmaids tale now 
being made into a feature film starring natasha richardson and 
robert duvall worrying it would not be well received 
i think it could have been an artistic disaster writing 
utopia is tricky it can easily get detoured into a tour of the 
sewage plant it can become a depiction of society that excludes 
the characters 
but having considered the novel for many years atwood felt she 
could no longer put it off 
it was interfering with all the other books i was trying to 
write she said it kept getting into other work where it 
didnt belong the only way to stop it from doing that was to write 
this book 
born in ottawa in 1939 atwood was first known for her poetry 
winning the governor generals award in 1966 for circle game 
an anthology 
her first novel the edible woman came out in 1969 to mixed 
reviews but surfacing the lady oracle and life before 
man established her as an exceptionally witty writer with 
interests ranging from the environment to the transience of modern 
relationships 
i think many many areas always go into your writing atwood 
explained thats one of the differences with novels or being a 
dentist a dentist excludes everything except what hes 
concentrating on whereas being a writer is the art of synthesis 
its inclusionary because life is multiple it includes 
everything 
in cats eye she has some fun at her own expense when 
elaine spots a poster of herself with a mustache 
whoever drew this mustache knew what he was doing or she 
nothing precludes that its a curled flowing mustache like a 
cavaliers with a graceful goatee to match it goes with my hair 
atwood whose novels have often been called feminist because of 
their hardedged look at how women cope in a maledominated world 
shows men in a more positive light in cats eye giving 
affectionate portrayals of elaines father brother and second 
husband in fact women are responsible for much of the wrongdoing 
especially elaines childhood friends who subject her to endless 
ridicule and cruelty 
i was getting a little tired of the view that all men were 
horrible in the victorian age women had to be good or somehow 
better 
but atwood who called one of her poetry collections power 
politics has not softened her outlook 
the foreground is womens culture but the background is mens 
culture ready to strike every once in a while the background 
comes to the foreground we think we live in a peaceful country but 
its an illusion

resurgent country music star buck owens 
says doodling around with former beatle ringo starr was a 
milestone of his long career 
owens the former grinning cohost of the hee haw syndicated 
tv show and starr recently recorded a duet of the song act 
naturally both had separately released the song in the 1960s 
ive never had so much fun in all my life the 59yearold 
owens said about his recording session with starr in london at the 
abbey road studios where the beatles recorded often 
id been out of music for a while and so had he owens said 
he played me a little bit of drums doodling around we called 
it hes very talented 
the much anticipated record will probably be released this 
summer 
how many people get a chance to sing with ringo starr owens 
mused as he reflected on his career upswing 
the duet marked another achievement in a rebounding career for 
owens who left hee haw in 1986 after 17 years on the country 
music comedy show 
in the past year he reemerged as a recording artist after 
about 10 years away from the studio to concentrate on his business 
interests he and rising country star dwight yoakam teamed up on 
the no 1 country hit streets of bakersfield 
the song added to owens long list of honkytonk hits including 
ive got a tiger by the tail together again my heart 
skips a beat loves gonna live here gonna have you 
buckaroo only you and before you go 
as a songwriter he composed crying time which was a hit by 
ray charles 
in april in honor of owens many contributions to country 
music the academy of country music gave him its pioneer award 
owens in keeping with his return to the stage said hell 
probably show up on hee haw again i left a lot of friends 
there he said in an interview 
i loved doing it it was lots of fun 
he quit for much the same reason he ceased his recording career 
in 1979 too much exposure 
i felt that doing the same show for that long might be like 
being married to the same woman too long he said 
a fateful meeting in owens office in bakersfield calif led 
to his return to the recording scene yoakam showed up one day and 
he and owens hit it off immediately 
when i first saw him i saw a rebel owens recalled i saw 
in him a freshness an absolute attitude of im going to play my 
music my way he has great charisma and he could be the next big 
superstar 
he could be able to sell as many records as george strait or 
randy travis or some of the others 
its been brewing this rage toward more traditional country 
music you began to see the tip of the cowboy hat and then the 
hurricane came highway 101 the desert rose band rodney crowell 
and all these people bringing good pickin and attracting young 
concert goers 
i guess i missed it cutting records more than i thought i 
would i remember my wife saying get something to do or youre 
going to kill us all 
so he teamed up with yoakam and also released the solo album 
hog dog he began scheduling concert appearances where his 
famous red white and blue guitar could be seen in public again 
then the duet with starr materialized 
owens described the act naturally duet as his version and 
my version and our version and a little surprise or two along the 
way he gives a little texastype yell i guess youd call it 
country rock 
ringo sings it better than ever his voice is much broader 
than it was when he was with the beatles he said he was very 
friendly and posed for pictures with anybody who asked he was 
about the most approachable famous person ive ever met 
im thinking about how best the record can be received i 
dont want to gimmick it up 
ive got a good feeling about the song we did one song only 
but we talked about other things we might do another track and may 
do a video 
owens said starr has a keen sense of humor and would be a good 
guest on hee haw 
hed fit right in

producer of chlorine and caustic soda had sought to buy general 
ceramics of haskell nj a 30 millionayear manufacturer of 
hightech ceramics for 59 million

control data corp is hoping the 
abandonment of its supercomputer subsidiary a technical success 
that turned into a financial fiasco sets the stage for sustained 
growth after several years of problems 
but observers say the trouble created by the companys eta 
systems will take some time to ease 
putting the cork on it ends the cash drain but it will take 
cash to clean up and get out of it the company doesnt have much 
in the way of cash theres a real problem there said martin 
knoblowitz a vice president at standard amp poors corp in new 
york which said mondays announcement could mean a downgrade in 
control datas credit rating 
about 3100 jobs will be cut in the restructuring unveiled 
monday and the company expects restructuring charges of 490 
million more than half of the 3100 job lost will come in 
minnesota chairman robert price said 
most of the restructuring costs will be taken in the second 
quarter price said the changes should result in a profitable 
second half of 1989 and set up sustained growth he said 
nonetheless he called the decision to dump eta six years after 
it was formed very very hard and very painful 
while eta was a technological success it was a very large 
drain on the company price said its the highestrisk part of 
a very highrisk industry 
supercomputers are designed to handle large quantities of data 
and operate at extremely high speeds among their uses are nuclear 
weapons design weather forecasting and oil exploration 
eta which employed 800 people lost 100 million in 1988 and 
never made money for the company since its founding eta sold 34 
machines ranging in price from 1 million to 20 million price 
said 
price said the company explored the idea of selling eta or 
operating it in a joint venture but he said the market did not 
support those options partly because a buyer or partner would be 
taking on a considerable burden 
he said the company could not obtain financing on its own to 
continue eta which he said had no market momentum 
the shutdown of eta will cost about 350 million said john 
buckner control datas chief financial officer the other charges 
against earnings will stem from a streamlining of the companys 
cyber mainframe computer business where staff cuts will be made 
price said control data will only recover a modest sum from 
the sale of eta assets and its licensed technology japan and other 
countries will be considered as potential markets for the 
technology but there may be resistance from the us government on 
a foreign sale said frank ryan a control data spokesman 
the company will now concentrate on mainframe computers data 
storage technical services and information services such as its 
arbitron ratings co price said 
control data stock fell 87 cents a share to 2150 monday on the 
new york york stock exchange while the stock of crosstown rival 
cray research inc closed up 1 at 5487 cray dominates the 
industry but is being challenged by japanese makers 
id be smiling if i were cray research right now said roger 
redmond an analyst for minneapolisbased piper jaffray amp hopwood 
inc 
redmond said the actions taken by control data were necessary 
but he said he was surprised by the high estimated cost of the 
restructuring he said mondays announcement ends rumors that 
control data will sell its mainframe business 
buckner said control data is in the process of negotiating a new 
lending agreement with its banks the company received a waiver on 
its current pact because it could not meet requirements of 
maintaining profitability and a net worth of 950 million buckner 
said 
meantime the banks have agreed to give the company 30 million 
in credit and allow 105 million in existing letters of credit that 
already have been tapped to stand 
the last good year financially at control data was 1983 when 
the company posted a profit of 1617 million it earned 17 
million last year and 193 million in 1987 and lost a total of 
832 million in 1986 and 1985 it also has lost money in its last 
two quarters including a 128 million loss in the fourth quarter 
of 1988

eastman kodak co introduced two new 
disposable 35mm cameras today one that can be used underwater and 
another that has a special wideangle lens to better capture scenic 
views and city skylines 
the company also showed off three new 35mm films and said it is 
in the process of changing the packaging on its 200speed kodacolor 
gold film to include the words multipurpose 
the packaging change was not related to the april 5 introduction 
of onefilm by polaroid corp said wilbur prezzano kodaks general 
manager of photographic products 
onefilm polaroids line of 200speed conventional film is 
touted by the company as the ideal allpurpose film for people who 
are confused or tired of trying to figure out what film to buy 
if this were an average day there would be 100 million 
pictures taken around the world color negative pictures taken 
across a wide spectrum of lighting conditions by different types 
of people different knowledges prezzano said monday to think 
that those 100 million pictures would be best served by one product 
is incorrect 
he said the packaging change and the new products are part of a 
continuing effort by kodak to divide the overall photographic 
market by selling products designed for specific uses or for 
specific groups 
i think thats part of a general trend in worldwide 
manufacturing said eugene glazer a stock analyst for dean 
witter reynolds in new york the days of coming up with new 
products that are as homogenous as possible seem to be coming to an 
end certainly we are seeing that in photography 
even polaroid which seemingly bucked the niche trend with its 
onesizefitsall new film believes its participating in 
pigeonholing the worlds amateur photographers 
we see onefilm as a niche product too it just happens to be 
the largest and most underdeveloped niche said alan verch a 
spokesman for the cambridge massbased company 
kodaks new cameras while only having limited uses are 
nonetheless quite novel 
the stretch camera which has a list price of 1295 
produces unusual long and narrow prints 3 by 10 inches with a 
wideangle 25mm lens it can capture about onethird more area than 
standard pointandshoot 35mm cameras 
its for use outdoors only and comes loaded with a 12exposure 
roll of 200speed kodacolor gold film 
the stretch camera will be available in europe this summer 
a similar model also will be sold in japan the stretch will be 
available in the united states later this year 
kodaks other new camera the weekend 35 can take 
photographs up to 12 feet underwater and comes loaded with a roll 
of 24exposure kodacolor gold 400speed film 
its retail price is 1395 kodak will begin selling it in us 
coastal areas in late june 
disposable cameras have been sold in japan for several years 
where they are a fastgrowing product fuji photo film co ltd of 
japan and kodak introduced disposable models in this country in 
1987 the models are aimed at tourists who neglect to bring their 
cameras along on vacation kodaks new cameras are designed to 
broaden the appeal of disposable models 
glazer said that these and other niche cameras kodak also 
has cameras designed for children and for teenagers are going to 
play a key role in the photographic industry in coming years 
each one taken separately is relatively unimportant but in 
combination in total i think theyll be extremely important 
but michael ellman an analyst at wertheim schroder amp co said 
hes not convinced that niche cameras are the wave of the future 
because most people use one or two cameras they dont want to rely 
on all different kinds 
the three new 35mm films kodak introduced are 
a 125speed ektar film ektar is kodaks premium film designed 
for the advanced amateur photographer previously it was only 
available in 25speed and 1000speed 
a 1600speed kodacolor gold film this brings a very high speed 
to kodaks allpurpose color negative film 
an improved kodacolor gold 400speed film with finer grain and 
more accurate color

south africalinked minorco sa the free 
worlds largest gold concern has lost another round in its bid to 
acquire the no 2 gold producer consolidated gold fields plc 
a federal judge in manhattan on monday refused to modify an 
order barring minorco from acquiring more gold fields stock 
the decision by us district judge michael b mukasey continues 
a preliminary injunction he issued last october 
gold fields has significant gold mining holdings in south 
africa australia and the united states including 90 percent of 
newmont gold the largest gold producer in the country 
last fall minorco a luxembourg corporation largely controlled 
by two south african concerns anglo american corp of south africa 
and de beers consolidated mines ltd launched a 49 billion 
hostile takeover bid since upped to 6 billion for consolidated 
gold fields 
but gold fields a british concern resisted and filed an 
antitrust action in new york claiming that a takeover could result 
in minorcos dominating the strategically important world gold 
market 
this court enjoined the takeover because the resulting 
combination would control 323 percent of the noncommunist world 
gold market mukasey said in a 45page opinion issued monday 
minorco through its various holdings is the largest gold 
producer in the west accounting for 203 percent of all 
production gold fields with about a 12 percent share is the 
secondlargest according to court papers 
mukaseys injunction also prevents minorco from selling its gold 
fields holdings to other entities within the south african 
conglomerate without court approval 
minorco sought to modify the injunction allowing it to complete 
its acquisition of gold fields while promising to sell off certain 
us australian and south african assets within a year to resolve 
antitrust allegations made by gold fields 
but mukasey rejected that bid saying there was no guarantee that 
anglo and debeers wouldnt eventually repurchase the divested 
concerns because south african laws enable companies there to 
conceal the source of their overseas investments in order to avoid 
the effects of antiapartheid laws 
last month a federal appeals court upheld mukaseys preliminary 
injunction on antitrust grounds and ordered him to consider whether 
the takeover bid violates us securities laws 
in mondays ruling however mukasey rejected gold fields 
claims that minorco had failed to fully disclose its south african 
interests in violation of us securities laws 
gold fields sought to widen the scope of the injunction by 
claiming minorco violated the antifraud provisions of us 
securities laws for allegedly making and false and misleading 
statements about how much control south african corporations and 
individuals have over it 
gold fields claimed the oppenheimer family of south africa 
indirectly controls minorco anglo american and debeers and that 
the stigma of south africas apartheid racial policy could make it 
difficult to conduct business in some countries 
but mukasey found those claims were only part of a delaying 
tactic to push minorcos offer past its april 26 deadline which 
under british law would bar it from renewing its bid for more than 
a year

northwest airlines parent company may begin 
negotiating with suitors but may also consider restructuring moves 
including the acquisition of another company or liquidation of the 
airline its board has decided 
all interested parties will be given a fair chance to 
demonstrate their ability to consummate a transaction nwa inc 
said in a statement monday announcing that its board of directors 
had given permission to management to negotiate with interested 
buyers including billionaire oilman marvin davis 
nonpublic information would be provided to qualified third 
parties who execute an acceptable confidentiality agreement nwa 
said 
but nwa repeated its contention that davis 27 billion 
90ashare bid is inadequate and said it would give strong 
preference to allcash fully financed bids 
meanwhile davis announced in a statement released early today 
how he would finance his bid for the nations fourthlargest 
airline 
the financing package totals approximately 33 billion and 
would be used for the acquisition of nwa and to refinance as 
necessary nwas existing senior debt according to the statement 
citicorp north america inc and citibank na would provide 
24 billion of senior debt of which citibank has committed to 
lend 500 million and would syndicate the balance with a group of 
other major banks the statement said 
also donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp would raise 
600 million of subordinated debt 
approximately 300 million for the acquisition would be 
contributed in the form of equity by a davis family investment 
partnership 
in addition citibank would provide a 250 million backup 
revolving line of credit to be available to supplement nwas 
working capital the statement said 
we believe this is a very strong financing package davis 
said with this financing package no sales of any strategic 
assets will be required to meet the companys financial obligations 
in fact we would expect and could comfortably finance the 
expansion of nwas passenger capacity by over 30 percent over the 
next six years 
state officials have fought davis takeover effort because they 
fear that davis would have to sell part of nwa to finance the deal 
northwest and state officials could not be reached immediately 
to comment on davis financing package 
nwas statement stressing that no decisions have been made 
also noted possible restructuring moves including the acquisition 
of another company a partial or complete liquidation of the 
airline a repurchase of shares a special dividend to 
shareholders or a sale of equity to third parties 
analysts said the boards announcement accomplishes several 
things 
dick warden an analyst with ids financial services inc said 
it could flush out other potential bidders 
maybe theyre saying is there anyone out there whos 
serious if not lets get back to the business of running an 
airline warden said 
gov rudy perpich who has led efforts to stop davis from buying 
nwa said the announcement indicated northwest officials were 
just protecting their flank against stockholder discontent

housing construction suffering under the 
impact of rising mortgage rates fell 54 percent in march as work 
on singlefamily homes slowed to the weakest pace in more than four 
years the government said today 
the housing report by the commerce department was likely to 
intensify fears that the economy is in danger of toppling into a 
new recession housing because it is so sensitive to rising 
interest rates is often a harbinger of troubles in other sectors 
of the economy 
the report said applications for building permits a good 
indicator of future activity plunged by 137 percent in march the 
biggest monthly drop since a 14 percent decline in october 1981 in 
the early stages of the last recession 
the 54 percent decline in construction of new homes and 
apartments was the second monthly decrease following a 12 percent 
drop in february it left construction work at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 14 million units last month as work on 
both singlefamily homes and apartment buildings weakened 
construction of singlefamily homes dropped below the 1 million 
mark to an annual rate of 994000 units the slowest pace since 
january 1985 
starts of multifamily units fell 88 percent to an annual rate 
of 403000 units 
econommists have blamed rising mortgage rates for the housing 
slowdown fixedrate mortgages are now averaging 1111 percent up 
by almost one full percentaage point from a year ago according to 
a national survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp 
the federal reserve over the past year has been pushing interest 
rates higher in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures but 
president bush and various members of congress have expressed fears 
that the fed may be in danger of overdoing the credittightening a 
growing number of economists have started to predict that a new 
recession is likely to begin by late this year or early in 1990 
the weakness in march was led by a steep 341 percent drop in 
construction activity in the northeast a region which until 
recently had been experiencing a building boom triggered by 
improving fortunes of hightechnology industries in the area 
but in march northeast construction starts fell to an annual 
rate of 149000 units the slowest building pace in the region 
since september 1983 
starts of new homes and apartments were off 52 percent in the 
south dropping to an annual rate of 546000 units while starts in 
the west dropped by 1 percent to a rate of 395000 units 
the midwest was the only region of the country to enjoy an 
increase in activity with housing construction climbing by 104 
percent to an annual rate of 307000 units 
the 137 percent decline in building permits in march followed a 
61 percent fall in february and left permits at an annual rate of 
122 million units the slowest pace since october 1982

president bush today promised union leaders 
the door will be open to them at the white house while skirting 
two issues that have caused a souring of labors relations with the 
new administration the eastern airlines strike and the fight over 
raising the minimum wage 
we have had honest differences but we agree on goals the 
president told a gathering of about 3000 officials of building 
trades unions you build a better america every single day 
while avoiding the eastern and minimum wage issues bush courted 
his audience by promising to appoint officials to the national 
labor relations board whose neutrality and integrity are above 
reproach my appointments will not be antilabor or as i say 
antibusiness 
that comment drew bush hearty applause from the union officials 
who have accused former president reagan of appointing antilabor 
representatives to the labor relations board 
the speech was bushs first to a labor organization since his 
election although many union leaders have complained recently 
about the administrations positions bush promised the door will 
be open even though he is likely to have honest differences 
with labor 
bush also saluted the american labor movement for supporting 
polands solidarity movement saying when the free trade 
movement is threatened so too is democracy 
the president received a polite response from the delegates and 
was given a standing ovation when he entered the room and another 
as he departed 
bushs appearance came 24 hours after senate majority leader 
george mitchell told the aflcio building and construction trades 
department conference that the president is against us in the 
minimumwage fight and urged them to press him on the issue 
maybe you can ask him this question mitchell told the 
delegates how is it that the president can propose a tax cut of 
30000 a year for the very richest americans and yet at the same 
time say that 30 cents an hour for the poorest americans is too 
much i say that is wrong and that is unfair 
mitchell dmaine was referring to bushs proposal to cut 
capital gains taxes and to the 30 cents an hour difference between 
bushs offer to raise the minimum wage to 425 by 1992 and the 
455 target in legislation passed by both the house and senate 
the delegates gave mitchell rousing applause when he vowed to 
pass the democrats minimum wage bill and a number of other 
democratic initiatives with or without bushs support 
perhaps mindful of the recent souring of labors relations with 
the white house building and construction trades department 
president robert a georgine on monday told delegates bush deserved 
their courtesy 
despite our political differences and there are many 
bush is an honorable and decent man georgine said 
the only major labor union to endorse bush the teamsters is a 
member of the building trades group leaders of several of the 
participating unions said they expected bush and labor secretary 
elizabeth dole who was to address the gathering after the 
president to receive polite welcomes 
still the presidents appearance comes as the initial hope 
labor leaders had of improved relations with the white house is 
giving way to a growing belief among the union officials that the 
new administration offers slim prospects for changing the 
antiunion bent of the reagan years 
as evidence they cite bushs refusal to intervene to block the 
strike by machinists at eastern airlines and his promise to veto 
the democratsponsored minimum wage bill 
in refusing to block the eastern strike now in its seventh 
week bush became the first president to ignore a recommendation of 
the national mediation board which urged bush to delay a strike by 
using his power to appoint an emergency mediation board 
we were hoping that the relations would have been a lot closer 
but someone obviously has decided differently said robert 
mcglotten labors top washington lobbyist our door is still 
open were not interested in confrontation but the white house 
doors are closed it makes things a lot tougher when youre not 
talking to anybody

the first fiberoptic cable across the pacific 
ocean went into service today tying the united states and japan 
together more tightly than ever before 
the cable no bigger than a garden hose stretches 8271 miles 
from california through hawaii splitting in the western pacific 
into legs that travel to guam and japan 
pacific link vastly increases the capacity for communication 
across the pacific which is sometimes called the ocean of 
americas future 
instead of driving a golden spike the builders of the 700 
million cable marked its completion with a video teleconference 
between japan and the boardroom of the new york stock exchange 
the distance between the two countries has become shorter 
shiro uramatsu executive vice president of the tokyo stock 
exchange said from the japanese end of the hookup 
we now have a new base a new plateau for communications 
services john berndt president of international communications 
services for american telephone amp telegraph co said in new york 
the completion of pacific link comes just four months after 
completion of the first fiberoptic cable across the atlantic 
tat8 which was inaugurated with a video speech by author and 
futurist isaac asimov 
fiber links will now stretch most of the way around the world 
competing with satellites for the business of carrying phone calls 
computer traffic and video conferences satellites are still used 
for television 
unlike traditional copper cables fiberoptic cables carry 
information in pulses of laser light the single new cable will be 
able to carry 40000 phone calls at a time across the pacific 
compared with less than 1000 for the two copper cables already in 
service combined 
atampt owns 35 percent of the cable kokusai denshin denwa 
japans international phone company owns 23 percent there are 30 
partners in all including mci communications corp and us sprint 
communications co as well as phone companies in australia 
brunei canada france west germany hong kong south korea new 
zealand the philippines singapore spain taiwan and britain 
laying fiber across deep oceans required some special 
considerations surfers had to be moved aside at hawaiis makaha 
beach to make room for a dinghy that brought the cable ashore 
sharks are attracted to the cables so they had to be sheathed in 
steel to a depth of about 8500 feet that makes those sections 
about the thickness of a mans fist 
the transatlantic cable has suffered three partial outages in 
its brief life two caused by damage from fishing trawlers on the 
french leg and one caused by an electrical short on the british 
leg said atampt spokesman rick wallerstein 
the pacific link leaves the west coast at point arena about 100 
miles north of san francisco after its split in the western 
pacific the southern leg goes to guam and the northern touches 
land in chikura japan 
phone traffic between the united states and japan is growing 
about 20 percent a year wallerstein said worldwide international 
phone traffic is growing about 15 percent a year a figure that 
includes the japan growth he said

us corporate takeover specialist t boone pickens 
jr arrived in japan tuesday after denying any hostile intent in 
his purchase of the largest block of shares in koito manufacturing 
co a japanese auto parts maker 
there was nothing hostile about it were not trying to take 
over koito pickens said in an interview broadcast tuesday by the 
japan broadcasting corp 
pickens also called the purchase of stock a test case for 
access to the japanese market by american investors and said he 
was traveling to japan to explain the move to koito management 
as of march 31 pickens held 324 million shares or 202 
percent of koito stock koito is a major supplier of lighting 
systems to toyota motor corp which owns 191 percent of its 
shares and to nissan motor corp which owns 595 percent 
we evaluated the situation and felt that koito was a company 
that was one of the best in its business worldwide pickens said 
in the interview conducted before his departure from the united 
states we thought it was a good investment 
pickens warned that public sentiment in the united states would 
turn against japan if it does not allow access for american 
investors 
japanese are making a big mistake when they dont invite 
americans into japan as america has invited the japanese in 
pickens said he said his investment was a test case to see what 
the attitude is toward an american investor in japan 
many japanese analysts have looked at pickens purchase as a 
possible greenmail attempt in greenmail a hostile corporate 
suitor makes profits when his stock is purchased at a premium by 
another shareholder friendly to the company 
hostile takeovers are still relatively rare in japan 
japanese news reports have said the finance ministry is 
investigating possible irregularities in pickens acquisition of 
the shares including incomplete or tardy disclosures to 
authorities regarding the purchase

citizens and southern corp chairman bennett a 
brown addressing shareholders today painted takeover suitor ncnb 
corp as an institution more concerned with making a name for 
itself than with sound banking practices 
brown urged the shareholders to support the camps board in its 
rejection of ncnbs 24 billion stock transfer offer 
let me put it bluntly ncnb cannot afford camps brown said to 
loud applause 
brown repeatedly referred to ncnbs recent acquisition of a 20 
percent stake in first republicbank corp of texas now called ncnb 
texas saying it was an example of ncnbs risktaking approach 
that acquisition came after the federal deposit insurance corp 
picked ncnb to manage the ailing texas bank 
it ncnb is managed with the purpose of making a name for 
itself among the worlds largest banking institutions brown 
said thats not our mission 
brown said shareholders would benefit more from camps 
riskaverse approach to banking which he said provided more 
sustained growth 
neither the initial offer nor the streetrumored offers come 
close to reflecting the value of the camps franchise the fact is 
that camps is already performing in a manner that produces reliable 
longterm value for our shareholders he said 
he was given a standing ovation when he concluded his address 
later brown was asked by a shareholder whether he would 
consider putting the ncnb proposal to a shareholders vote brown 
said he would not 
it is the board of directors responsibility shareholders can 
vote to elect or replace the board brown said 
todays annual meeting in atlanta was the first gathering of camps 
shareholders since north carolinabased ncnb inc made an 
unsolicited bid last month to acquire the atlantabased banking 
company 
though matters pertaining directly to the ncnb bid were not on 
the agenda the proposed takeover drew much attention to the 
meeting and had been expected to dominate discussion 
in official business the shareholders approved a measure that 
would authorize the board to consider the effect any acquisition 
would have on camps employees customers suppliers creditors and 
communities where the bank does business the vote count was not 
immediately available 
camps spokesman scott scredon said 16 states now require company 
boards of directors to take the broad view in deciding whether to 
agree to a takeover but georgia law gives companies the option of 
whether to go beyond shareholder interest 
lynn easley spokeswoman for ncnb in charlotte nc said 
monday the company did not plan to have a representative attend 
todays meeting in atlanta 
ncnb last month offered to merge with camps under a stock transfer 
at the time valued at 24 billion the camps board april 3 rejected 
the offer saying it was inadequate and not in the best interest of 
the shareholders 
despite repeated requests from ncnb chairman hugh l mccoll jr 
camps officials have refused to meet with ncnb to discuss the offer 
further mccoll has said all aspects of the deal are negotiable 
though he said ncnb will not make a cash offer 
in a letter monday to brown mccoll said ncnb would make a 
substantial price increase in the proposal if camps would agree 
to a facetoface meeting 
last week the two companies engaged in an increasingly heated 
exchange of statements in which camps said the takeover bid was 
senseless and riddled with regulatory hurdles and ncnb accused camps 
of waging a disinformation campaign 
mccoll in a visit to atlanta last week said camps shareholders 
should decide whether to accept the offer he did not specify how 
he intended to get the issue to a shareholder vote

mondays close

record so far this spring has been spotty

tax accounting practices at georgia power co 
already under investigation by a federal grand jury are being 
reviewed by the securities and exchange commission 
the federal agency began its own investigation last month 
according to papers filed with the sec the probe includes georgia 
power and its parent firm the southern co 
the us justice department last year began investigating 
alleged tax fraud at the utility after a georgia power accountant 
provided the internal revenue service with information regarding 
possible violations of federal law in the method by which spare 
parts were accounted for in financial documents a grand jury in 
atlanta currently is hearing testimony in that investigation 
an attorney for the southern co said the sec activity was a 
natural outgrowth of the justice department probe 
the sec is looking at how the utility holding company handled 
the disclosure of financial and tax accounting in proxy statements 
reports documents and other securities materials submitted to the 
sec and investors according to southern 
ronald l crawford assistant regional commissioner for the sec 
in atlanta said agency policy prohibited comment on investigations 
southern is the parent firm of georgia power alabama power 
gulf power mississippi power and savannah electric 
thomas j hartland an attorney representing southern said the 
company was not surprised by the sec investigation though the 
federal agency did not formally notify the company 
we would have been surprised had the sec not undertaken this 
kind of factfinding in administering the holding company act and 
securities laws hartland said 
the southern co did not mention the sec investigation in its 
recent annual report to stockholders but a company spokesman said 
the report already had been printed when the company learned of the 
probe 
the investigation was noted in the financial statement that 
publicly owned companies must file annually with the sec

airlines today announced they were cutting the price by 25 percent 
on the first segment of the partnership in a move to help speed 
federal approval 
we are serious about bringing other partners into this 
partnership said john hotard a spokesman for americans sabre 
system so for the first 20 percent we will sell it at 15 
million a percentage point 
delta paid american 650 million in february to join up with 
sabre the nations largest reservations system in a 5050 
partnership the airlines said then that they each would sell up to 
half of their interest 
at the time the companies put a 20 million price tag on each 
percentage point in other words it would have cost 400 million 
to buy 20 percent of the partnership 10 percent each from 
american and delta 
that amount would now cost 300 million 
the as yet unnamed partnership is being reviewed by the federal 
trade commission which is studying whether it restricts trade 
sabre is the nations largest airline reservation system with about 
38 percent of the market deltas datasii system is one of the 
smallest at about 6 percent market share 
hotard said the price was reduced to show the airlines are 
serious about bringing in other partners 
we have had some serious airlines both domestic and 
international come and talk to us and look at the deal hotard 
said but none have agreed to buy into the partnership 
as we said in our original announcement we want to bring 
others into the venture as quickly as possible american chairman 
robert crandall said we have formed this partnership in good 
faith and we are serious about building the partnership into a 
worldwide computer reservations system 
delta chairman ron allen in a joint statement with crandall 
said we are also interested in the participation of nonairline 
related firms such as hotel and car rental companies who have shown 
an expertise and interest in information management and computer 
technology

mcdonnell douglas corp md80 narrowbody twinjets and 8 mcdonnell 
douglas md11 widebody threeengine jets it said 
the company announced earlier today in paris that it also was 
ordering 43 billion worth of airplanes from airbus industrie the 
european consortium it will buy 30 of airbus industries a320s 10 
a330s and two a340s it said it also has placed options to take a 
further 10 a330s and two a340s 
at a news conference in new york gpa chairman and chief 
executive ta ryan said the company plans to take delivery of 80 
to 100 new planes a year over the next six to seven years 
for the first time it provides massive flexibility for the 
airlines and particularly the smaller carriers ryan said the 
airline business is going to increase and the number of passengers 
is going to increase very dramatically 
he noted the airlines growing use of operating leases for 
aircraft which average 6 years for gpa 
ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by a 
group of us and japanese banks led by citibank 
gpa said the engine suppliers include cfmi a joint venture of

airlines concern with replacing their aging fleets

in the industry has boosted airplane prices and is lenthening the 
long waiting lists for aircraft

the senate today rejected the first effort to 
amend savings and loan bailout legislation signaling an uphill 
fight for senators trying to change the plan negotiated behind 
closed doors by members of its banking committee 
senators voted 6632 to block an amendment offered by freshman 
sen bob kerrey dneb which would weaken the administrations 
control over a new resolution trust corp for disposing of an 
estimated 400 billion of real estate expected to fall into the 
governments hands because of sampl failures 
sen dale bumpers dark not a member of the committee 
pleaded with colleagues to vote on the amendment based on its 
merits 
the banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom to 
suggest that the document is sacred and every word is infallible 
well we just may as well go home now he said 
sen alan dixon dill one of the banking panels senior 
members told senators they could be accommodated when the bill 
reaches a housesenate conference but for now he said its a 
better bill than the house bill and i think we ought to leave it 
alone 
revenues from the sale of the real estate are to be used to 
reduce the taxpayers costs from the bailout expected to total 
some 200 billion over the next 30 years 
president bush wanted the new agency to be run under a 
threemember board made up of treasury secretary nicholas brady 
attorney general dick thornburgh and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan 
the senate banking committee expanded the board to include two 
businessmen to be appointed by bush kerrey wanted to expand the 
board to seven members and give its chairman the power to name his 
colleages while weakening the status of brady thornburgh and 
greenspan by making them exofficio members 
because the board will have control over the greatest 
concentration of land buildings and real estate ever amassed in 
the nations history the potential for scandal is unprecedented 
kerrey said 
however the banking committees chairman sen donald w riegle 
jr dmich and ranking republican sen jake garn of utah 
opposed kerreys amendment saying it would put too much control in 
private interests 
it goes further than we ought to go at this time riegle 
said 
leaders want the bill passed by wednesday and senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine has threatened to call senators 
back to work friday in the middle of the passover recess if they 
miss the deadline 
the bill is a carefully crafted compromise garn said 
extraneous and controversial amendments could upset that balance 
and lead us into bickering and delays we simply cannot afford 
in most respects the legislation tracks the proposal presented 
in february by bush pledging 157 billion to the problem over the 
next 10 years and providing a smorgasbord of reforms chief among 
them a requirement that sampl owners back their lending with more of 
their own capital 
most changes in the presidents plan were crafted by the 
committee behind closed doors then ratified in a public session 
last thursday and despite the plea for fast action several 
senators both on and off the committee are seeking another crack 
at further amending the plan 
sen bob graham dfla a committee member said he would offer 
an amendment scrapping the administrations proposal for keeping 
50 billion of the spending out of the budget deficit 
graham maintains that including the spending in the budget will 
reduce the governments cost of borrowing the money 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio is examining a variety of 
amendments including measures requiring institutions to cash 
government checks offer low cost checking accounts to poor people 
and disclose their record of lending to poor and minority 
neighborhoods he is also considering a measure repealing special 
tax benefits designed to encourage purchase of failed sampls 
other senators who may offer changes include 
sen larry pressler rsd who would give small solvent sampls 
more time than other sampls to meet capital requirements 
sen don nickles rokla who would force large banks to pay 
insurance premiums on deposits from foreigners even though those 
deposits are not technically insured they are usually protected 
because regulators have a policy of keeping big banks afloat rather 
than closing them 
meanwhile three consumer groups the consumer federation of 
america consumers union and the association of community 
organizations for reform now castigated both the house and senate 
versions as providing loopholes in what appear to be tough capital 
requirements 
the groups particularly criticized the senate bill for allowing 
sampls 25 years to remove goodwill from their books goodwill which 
is not permitted to banks represents the value assigned by 
accountants of an institutions value as a going concern it 
disappears when an institution fails and is liquidated 
unfortunately the talk on capitol hill is much tougher than 
the bills that are rapidly moving through the house and senate 
said michelle meier an attorney with consumers union

million

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade on a forecast for rain 
in the corn belt and signs that the united states is becoming 
stingier with its wheat exports 
the national weather service in a forecast issued late monday 
predicted average to aboveaverage rainfall in the midwest early 
next week an outlook that prompted modest selling of corn and 
soybean futures 
many private meteorologists continued to predict dry weather 
though which limited the declines 
wheat futures prices dipped after an agriculture department 
official said the agency had suspended its grain export subsidy 
program which has been a major channel for large wheat sales to 
the soviet union and china 
but agriculture secretary clayton yeutter later said the 
announcement was in error and that the usda had made no decision to 
suspend the program despite relatively low stock levels of wheat 
and dryweather damage to the ripening winter wheat crop 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 407 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
to 2 cents lower with may at 275 a bushel oats were cent to 
2 cents lower with may at 198 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents

citizens and southern corp on tuesday reaffirmed 
its rejection of a 24 billion hostile takeover bid by ncnb corp 
saying both companies should get back to the business of 
banking 
campss board of directors voted unanimously against the offer 
shortly after chairman bennett a brown told shareholders that 
ncnb a charolotte ncbased banking company was interested only 
in gambling on risky expansions 
we will continue to fight all the way he said we have 
better staying power 
in a statement issued later brown said the board sent a letter 
to ncnbs board explaining the rejection and suggesting that both 
of these institutions get back to the business of banking and avoid 
further distraction and expense 
brown urged shareholders to support the camps board in its april 3 
rejection of ncnbs stock transfer offer made last month saying 
ncnb stock might be overvalued the board tuesday simply reaffirmed 
its earlier vote 
let me put it bluntly ncnb cannot afford camps brown said to 
loud applause 
lets get beyond all the recent speculation on wall street and 
in the press and face reality he said the ncnb offer makes no 
sense it would be bad for camps bad for our shareholders and bad 
for our employees customers and the communities we serve 
despite repeated requests from ncnb chairman hugh l mccoll jr 
camps has refused to discuss the offer further mccoll has said all 
aspects of the deal are negotiable but that ncnb will not make a 
cash offer 
in a letter monday to brown mccoll said ncnb would make a 
substantial price increase in the proposal if camps agrees to a 
facetoface meeting 
brown said ncnbs recent acquisition of a 20 percent stake in 
first republicbank corp of texas now called ncnb texas was an 
example of ncnbs high risktaking approach that acquisition came 
after the federal deposit insurance corp picked ncnb to manage the 
ailing texas bank 
ncnb has no financial flexibility brown said its 
management has invited us to gamble on both texas and taxes i will 
tell you it is of very questionable value at best 
the north carolina bank he said cannot put up cash for the 
acquisition so they have no way of protecting the value that our 
shareholders would expect in a stock transaction 
ncnb spokeswoman ginny mackin said the company had no immediate 
comment tuesdays developments ncnb said it did not have a 
representative at the meeting 
when asked by a shareholder brown said he would not consider 
putting the ncnb proposal to a shareholders vote it is the 
board of directors responsibility shareholders can vote to elect 
or replace the board brown said 
also tuesday camps employees bought a fullpage ad in the atlanta 
journalconstitution addressed to shareholders it said the 
employees stand with management against the ncnb offer

million compared with 75 million in the quarter of 1988

trying to overcome skepticism about its rebuilding 
plans strikecrippled eastern airlines enrolled more pilot 
recruits and tuesday ran fullpage ads featuring pilots who have 
crossed the picket lines 
were building a better stronger more unified airline and we 
are as proud as ever to wear the eastern uniform said ads with a 
photo of three veteran pilots and a list of nearly 200 other 
pilots they ran in the new york times washington post and the 
miami herald and will run again next week said company spokesman 
robin matell 
matell also said eastern this week began sixweek training 
courses for 79 new pilots two previous classes of 34 each will 
complete training in mid and latemay the company said 
many of them rank with the caliber of pilot flying for eastern 
many years said frank causey easterns vice president for 
flight operations 
pilots union spokesman ron cole scoffed at easterns claims 
saying theyre part of a publicity blitz theyve got on right 
now to try to bolster the parent texas airs claim that eastern 
wont be sold and is being rebuilt as a smaller efficient carrier 
this is a misguided attempt to show the bankruptcy court and 
the pilots that mr lorenzos downsizing effort is working it 
hasnt worked before and it isnt working now cole said 
company hopes of overcoming the march 4 machinists union strike 
were undercut when 3400 of the 3600 pilots honored machinists 
picket lines without the pilots eastern has been stuck at just 
over 100 flights a day or 10 percent of its prestrike schedule 
the company claims it can rebuild without the unions but many 
industry analysts have expressed doubts that eastern could come 
back generating enough revenues to satisfy creditors texas air 
said assets will be sold to raise cash but the unions continue to 
hope for a buyer to rescue eastern which is in chapter 11 
bankruptcy reorganization 
cole said company officials have been calling striking pilots at 
home in hopes of luring them back to work and sent a videotape to 
the pilots homes he said retired eastern pilots other eastern 
employees who have pilots licenses and even disabled pilots have 
been called even one fired pilot was called cole claimed 
matell said a company pilots communications committee has been 
keeping up contacts with pilots he said the committee has gone 
through pilots lists making calls and may have unknowingly called 
disabled pilots matell noted that pilots must pass physical 
examinations before flying again 
causey said the newly recruited pilots have an average 15 years 
of flying experience with military corporate or commuter airline 
experience common and even some pilots from major carriers 
the air line pilots association has said there is an 
industrywide shortage of experienced pilots and cole said eastern 
is offering a misleading appraisal of its recruits 
those participating in the ad campaign see it differently 
i was flabbergasted at my fellow pilots that so many chose to 
buy the alpa line about frank lorenzo said paul richardson a 
26year eastern pilot for me it was a nondecision easterns 
been very good to me as it has to all pilots 
the flying pilots said theyve had few problems with strikers 
other than placards shoved in front of their cars and other minor 
incidents

stock prices finished sharply higher today after 
two economic reports helped ease market fears about inflation 
the market shot up at the opening kicked off by active program 
trading that soon led to a broadbased rally 
the rally followed a surge in the bond market after news that 
housing starts were down dramatically and consumer prices rose less 
than expected in march 
analysts said the two reports helped ease concerns about rising 
inflation and provided further evidence that the economy slowed 
last month 
the commerce department reported that housing starts fell 54 
percent in march while applications for building permits plunged 
137 percent 
consumer prices jumped 05 percent last month slightly below 
market expectations of about 06 percent according to a report 
from the labor department 
the number was not better than epected but within 
expectations said jack garry equity analyst with butcher amp 
singer inc it gave people the impetus to get out there and buy 
the march consumer price index pushed the annual inflation rate 
to 61 percent higher than the 44 percent increase in 1988 
consumer prices rose 06 percent in january and 04 percent in 
february 
the market is still concerned about inflation but the figures 
were encouraging garry said 
analysts said the sharp decline in housing starts spurred by 
rising mortgage rates also increased the likelihood that the 
federal reserve would not continue raising interest rates and might 
even move to lower rates 
clearly the economy is slowing and clearly the fed may have to 
ease monetary policy said hugh johnson senior vice president at 
first albany corp

the highest levels since january 1986 
may wholesale home heating oil which rose 085 cent monday 
skidded 1 cent and settled at 5276 cents a gallon 
several considerations motivated energy brokers to buy tuesday 
said mary l haskins a vice president at drexel burnham lambert 
inc 
traders bought partly to adjust their holdings before the may 
crude contract expires on thursday a widespread expectation that 
weekly industry statistics due late tuesday would show a 
significant reduction in petroleum stocks also encouraged buying as 
did a report that output from an oil platform in the north sea was 
disrupted due to a leak 
continuing speculation that supplies will be unusually tight 
this spring and summer has lent a bullish tone to the energy 
markets lately particularly in the past three weeks since an exxon 
oil tanker accidentally spilled 10 million gallons of oil in

the securities and exchange commission plans to 
file a civil suit against singer co chairman paul a bilzerian 
who already faces criminal charges for alleged securities and tax 
fraud according to a published report 
the sec notified bilzerian last month of its intent to file the 
suit seeking substantial monetary disgorgement the wall street 
journal reported in tuesdays editions the notification was 
disclosed in court documents the journal said 
according to the documents william r mclucas an sec 
enforcement official also notified other unidentified individuals 
that they would be sued by the agency in connection with the 
alleged fraud mclucas declined to disclose the identities of these 
people the journal said 
bilzerian 38 is scheduled to go to trial may 1 on the tax and 
securities charges involving three corporate raids bilzerian has 
asserted his innocence 
the criminal case is likely to go ahead first even if the sec 
files its civil suit before may 1 the newspaper said 
a civil suit would allow the government to seek to reclaim funds 
it alleges were earned illegally the amount reclaimed through this 
process called disgorgement often exceeds the amount the 
government can collect in fines from a criminal conviction 
in addition the burden of proof is less strict in a civil case 
making it easier for the sec to prove its charges through a civil 
suit 
the criminal charges involve bilzerians publicly disclosed 
raids on hammermill paper co hh robertson co and cluett 
peabody amp co and an undisclosed investment involving armco inc 
bilzerians 106 billion takeover of singer completed last 
year was not part of the indictment

the disposable camera craze will be 
coming to a beach and scenic lookout near you very soon thanks to 
eastman kodak co 
the company introduced two throwaway 35mm cameras tuesday one 
that can be used underwater and another that has a special 
wideangle lens to better capture panoramic views and group shots 
both cameras come already loaded with a roll of film and cost 
under 15 
with lower prices added quality and versatility cameras are 
becoming personalized said wilbur prezzano general manager of 
photographic products for kodak 
disposable cameras which are basically cardboard and plastic 
wrapped around a roll of film are used once and taken to a 
photofinisher who removes the film and throws away the camera 
they were first introduced in japan several years ago and have 
become quite popular there both kodak and fuji photo film co 
introduced disposable models in the united states in 1987 
initially the disposable cameras were designed for sale to 
tourists who may have forgotten their cameras and wanted some 
vacation photos but the two new cameras introduced by kodak are 
designed to broaden that appeal 
these cameras are basically creating new picture opportunities 
and bringing more people into photography and thats good said 
mark obenzinger a stock analyst with wood gundy amp co in new york 
obenzinger said 9 million disposable cameras will be sold 
worldwide this year according to industry estimates next year 
that number is expected to reach 15 million 
although thats still a small amount considering that kodak 
estimates there are currently 330 million regular or 
nondisposable cameras in use around the world the fast growth 
rate has attracted the photo giants eye 
that means kodak will be introducing more disposable cameras in 
the future prezzano said 
we will continue to brainstorm and get feedback from 
consumers as to what their needs are the only limit is the number 
of good ideas people come up with he said 
the two new cameras are 
the stretch camera which has a list price of 1295 it 
produces unusual long and narrow prints 3 by 10 inches with a 
wideangle lens it can capture about onethird more area than 
standard pointandshoot 35mm cameras 
its for use outdoors only and comes loaded with a roll of 
200speed kodacolor gold film 
the stretch camera will be available in europe this summer 
a similar model will also be sold in japan the stretch will be 
available in the united states later this year 
the weekend 35 camera which can take photographs up to 12 
feet underwater and comes loaded with a roll of 24exposure 
kodacolor gold 400speed film 
its retail price is 1395 kodak will begin selling it along 
us coastal areas in late june 
kodak also said tuesday it plans to change the packaging on its 
200speed kodacolor gold 35mm film to include the words 
multipurpose film on the box 
analysts said this in response to the introduction two weeks ago 
of onefilm by polaroid corp which company officials touted as a 
kind of onesizefitsall film for consumers who were confused 
about what film to buy 
kodak also introduced three new 35mm films a 125speed film to 
round out its new ektar line for advanced amateur photographers a 
1600speed kodacolor gold color negative film to bring high speed 
to its regular line of film and an improved 400speed kodacolor 
gold

nine of the worlds largest banks are asking 
a federal judge to hold bank of america responsible for up to 650 
million in student loan losses what they called the most expensive 
foulup in the program ever 
identical us district court lawsuits filed monday said bank of 
america was to blame for the losses because as the loans trustee 
it failed to ensure proper procedures were followed 
huge losses in the complicated case stem from failure to follow 
federal guidelines for collection of 14 billion in student loans 
which in turn voided federal guarantees for the loans 
bank of america which anticipated the suits said it would have 
no comment because it had yet to see the filings 
filing the suits were citibank the nations largest bank 
raiffeisenboerenleenbank of the netherlands and seven of japans 
largest banks daiichi kangyo sumitomo fuji industrial bank of 
japan mitsubishi bank of tokyo and mitsubishi trust 
state and federal auditors discovered required collection 
procedures were neglected on at least 250000 loans the suits said 
the banks involved in the suits had extended letters of credit 
to back the 14 billion in loans mostly to vocational school 
students who have a high default rate the suits said 
while the letters of credit made the banks responsible for 
defaults the banks believed they were protected because the loans 
were guaranteed by the federal government strict collection 
guidelines were required however 
the us department of education said in march that it wouldnt 
honor the loan guarantees 
as a result the banks will be forced to pay out hundreds of 
millions of dollars which will not be reimbursed the 
lawsuits said 
losses have already exceeded 350 million and estimates of total 
losses range from 450 million to 650 million bank of tokyo said 
it alone has lost 177 million

irelands gpa group ltd joined the aircraft 
buying spree tuesday announcing a recordbreaking order for 308 
new planes valued at 17 billion 
the purchase of jets made by boeing co mcdonnell douglas corp 
and europes airbus industrie is the largest civilian aircraft 
order ever topping delta air lines 105 billion order for up to 
225 boeing and mcdonnell douglas aircraft last september 
the delta order was followed by other huge purchases as several 
us airlines scrambled to buy new planes 
at news conferences in new york london and paris gpa officials 
said the leasing company had placed firm orders for 121 new planes 
and had taken options on another 187 most of which are likely to 
be exercised 
gpa based in shannon ireland is one of the worlds biggest 
aircraft leasing firms its leading rivals include international 
lease finance corp of beverly hills calif and ansett transport 
industries ltd a huge australian company that is halfowned by 
media tycoon rupert murdoch 
gpas order reflects the growing importance of aircraft leasing 
companies which account for about onefifth of all aircraft 
orders it also underscores the airlines concern about replacing 
their aging fleets 
boeing is the major beneficiary of the orders gpa said it will 
buy 182 boeing airplanes for 94 billion comprised of 92 boeing 
737 narrowbody twinjet planes 50 boeing 757 narrowbody 
twinjet models and 40 boeing 767 twinengine widebody jets 
gpa will pay mcdonnell douglas 31 billion for 64 md80 
narrowbody twinjets and 8 md11 widebody threeengine jets 
the leasing company also is ordering 43 billion worth of 
airplanes from airbus industrie a european aircraft manufacturing 
consortium gpa will buy 30 airbus a320s 10 a330s and two a340s 
in addition the company took options on another 10 a330s and two 
a340s 
gpa plans to take delivery of 80 to 100 new planes a year over 
the next six to seven years 
gpa said the engine suppliers include cfmi a joint venture of 
general electric co of the united states and frances societe 
nationale detudes et construction de moteurs aviation general 
electric united technologies corps pratt and whitney 
rollsroyce plc and international aero engines jointly owned by 
united technologies daimlerbenz ag and rollsroyce 
this significant commitment means that we expect to purchase 
about 10 percent of all of the commercial jet aircraft delivered 
through the mid1990s gpa chairman and chief executive ta ryan 
told reporters in new york we will thus maintain our leadership 
and dominant market share of the new aircraft operating lease 
business which continues to grow rapidly 
aircraft leasing fills the gap between manufacturers unable to 
keep up with demand and airlines in a hurry to get planes to stay 
competitive lessors like gpa buy up batches of different kinds of 
planes and lease them to carriers in a pinch 
for the first time it provides massive flexibility for the 
airlines and particularly the smaller carriers ryan said the 
airline business is going to increase and the number of passengers 
is going to increase very dramatically 
the average length of a gpa operating lease is 6 years its 
relatively young fleet of planes are an average 3 years old 
compared with around 12 years for jetliners operated by us 
carriers 
ryan said the financing for the purchases will be provided by a 
group of us and japanese banks led by citibank 
gpa one of irelands largest firms is privately owned by 
several companies including air canada the irish airline aer 
lingus prudential insurance of the united states and mitsubishi 
trust bank of japan air canada and aer lingus hold stakes of 16 
percent ats for 19881989 are expected to total 150 million up 
from 101 million in the previous fiscal year

higher food and energy costs boosted consumer 
prices 05 percent in march and resulted in a 61 percent annual 
inflation rate for the first three months of 1989 the largest 
quarterly advance in two years the government said tuesday 
last months gain in the labor departments consumer price index 
was fresh evidence that inflation continues to run above the 44 
percent rate registered in both 1987 and 1988 
analysts said the bad news isnt over yet 
inflation was uncomfortably high widespread and entrenched in 
march said allen sinai chief economist for the boston co we 
havent seen the last of these high numbers because there will 
still be a rippling through of rising business costs for both 
materials and wages and rising energy costs in the next few 
months 
but stock prices rose sharply with the dow jones 30stock 
industrial average gaining 4161 points to close at 237940 a 
postcrash high 
thomas walsh of nikko securities international in new york said 
that people were expecting the numbers to be worse its not a 
great number but the street is viewing it as an ok number and it 
has stimulated buy interest 
economist james annable of the first national bank of chicago 
commented 
the market is betting that the economy is slowing down pretty 
dramatically i suspect thats wrong we expect slower growth but 
good growth inflation is going to continue to inch upward 
expectations that the economy is cooling off were bolstered by a 
report from the commerce department on tuesday that showed housing 
starts had fallen 54 percent in march with construction of 
singlefamily homes beginning at the slowest pace in more than four 
years 
the only good news on inflation was the bad news on housing 
underscoring a weak first quarter economy and raising hope that 
later on inflation can recede sinai said 
for a year the federal reserve board has been nudging interest 
rates upward in an effort to slow the economy and arrest inflation 
but a growing number of analysts are worried that the 
antiinflation campaign will slow the economy so much that the 
unintended result will be a recession 
the fed needs to ease pretty soon said david seiders chief 
economist for the national association of home builders if they 
dont i think a recession in late 1989 or early 1990 is probably 
inevitable 
economist john hagens of the wefa group a forecasting firm in 
bala cynwyd pa said the nation appears destined for a round of 
stagflation in which the economy slows while prices continue 
to rise forcing the federal reserve to choose between further 
restraining growth to curb inflation and boosting the economy to 
stimulate employment 
president bush told a building trades group the key to continued 
economic health for the nation is bringing down inflation and 
interest rates by reducing the federal deficit 
we must keep inflation and interest rates down and the way 
to do that is to bring the budget deficit down he said 
the march increase was traced in part to higher food costs 
which last month rose 08 percent twice as fast as in february 
taken together prices for meats poultry fish and eggs rose 
24 percent 
energy costs meanwhile registered their sharpest increase 
since august 1987 advancing 11 perent practically double the 
preceding months 06 percent 
gasoline prices climbed 21 percent last month after rising 17 
percent in february for the first quarter gasoline costs jumped 
48 percent 
the boost in petroleumbased energy prices up at a 224 percent 
annual rate so far this year accounted for nearly onehalf of the 
first quarter price acceleration the labor department said 
food price increases were responsible for nearly onefourth of 
the quarters gain the department said 
excluding those two volatile categories consumer prices rose 
04 percent in march the same as in february 
clothing prices rose 14 percent last month after dropping 02 
percent in february the increase was blamed on the introduction of 
higherpriced spring and summer fashions particularly for women 
medical care expenses rose 05 percent after jumping 08 percent 
in the preceding month 
the march figures left the overall consumer price index at 1223 
percent of its 198284 base meaning that a hypothetical selection 
of goods costing 100 in the base period would have cost 12230 in 
march 70 cents more than in february 
the overall index unlike other figures in the retail price 
report is not adjusted to remove the effect of periodic 
predictable seasonal fluctuations 
in another government report tuesday the labor department said 
americans average weekly earnings after adjusting for inflation 
were down 01 percent in march after falling 09 percent a month 
earlier 
average weekly earnings before adjusting for inflation were 
32886 up 41 percent from a year earlier

president bush on tuesday announced a speedup 
in crop payments to help farmers recover from last summers drought 
but said that perilous budgetdeficit times will mean cuts in 
other farm programs 
speaking on a radio interview program from the agriculture 
department bush said he was authorizing the acceleration of 
pricesupport payments to provide some extra money to farmers 
early in the crop year 
were listening we are with the american farmer in these 
tough times bush said 
he said the move would mean about 850 million in early payments 
for wheat feedgrain rice and cotton farmers 
the step also helps budget writers meet deficitreduction 
targets for 1990 by shifting the 850 million out of fiscal 1990 
which begins on oct 1 and into the current fiscal year 
bush putting on headphones in a small broadcast booth in the 
agriculture department answered questions from agricultural 
broadcasters for about 15 minutes the program was sent out over 
the agencys agricultural radio network 
the president also announced creation of a working group on 
rural development to be headed by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter he said the group would evaluate existing federal 
ruraldevelopment programs and make recommendations 
events such as last years drought reinforce the need to 
develop and diversify the rural economy in the years ahead bush 
said 
the price announcement made by bush makes an additional 10 
percent available to farmers in socalled advancedeficiency 
payments 
these are advances farmers can draw from the government at the 
start of a crop season against later payments 
tuesdays action raised from the current 40 percent to 50 
percent the size of advance payments wheat and feedgrain farmers 
can collect and from 30 percent to 40 percent the share rice and 
cotton farmers can collect in advance 
the advances are against anticipated government support 
subsidies to help farmers recover the difference between market 
prices and federally set target prices 
one interviewer asked bush how he reconciled heavy cuts in farm 
programs under the budget compromise recently negotiated by the 
white house and congressional leaders with his campaign vow not to 
balance the budget on farmers back 
we are in perilous budgetdeficit times weve got to get the 
deficit down and the best thing we can do to help the american 
farmer is to get these interest rates down and the best way to do 
that is to make the tough decision on the spending side of our 
budget he said 
now having said that i feel that farmers are for fair 
play bush added 
yes ag is taking a hit but so is a wide array of programs 
across the board he said 
asked if the speedup in payments would be the sum total of 
federal help for producers who are being hurt by the drought 
currently gripping kansas and much of the winter wheat area bush 
said this should not be viewed as the definitive answer we hope 
it is something that will help the farm family 
yeutter who appeared with bush on the program added clearly 
we dont have an open spigot that just spits out federal dollars in 
any situation today but well be as sympathetic and as 
accommodative as we can be within rather severe budgetary 
restraints 
asked about reports that the governments program to subsidize 
exports of wheat and other farm commodities is being scuttled 
yeutter said no such plan is in the works however as he has 
previously yeutter said the usdas export enhancement program or 
eep will come under review 
but no eep allocations currently in effect will be curtailed he 
said the program provides subsidies to private exporters for the 
sale of designated commodities to specific countries at reduced 
prices the object is to make us products competitive with other 
foreign suppliers notably the european economic community 
all that is at issue at the moment is any future allocations 
that might be made under the eep he said those will be 
considered on a casebycase basis primarily because of our 
stocks of grain condition and the weather conditions that now 
prevail 
but yeutter stressed that this is not to suggest that were 
going to put any kind of moratorium on the eep program we 
havent made that kind of decision

palladium futures prices plummeted the permitted daily limit for 
the second straight session tuesday on the new york mercantile 
exchange amid growing skepticism about the market impact of recent 
nuclear fusion research 
other precious metals prices also declined largely in reaction 
to government reports that showed weaker inflation than many 
observers had expected 
on other markets gasoline futures surged while other petroleum 
futures were mixed grain and soybean futures retreated and 
livestock and meat were mixed 
palladium settled 335 to 9 lower with the contract for 
delivery in june at 16565 a troy ounce the daily price limit was 
expanded to 9 from 6 following mondays limit decline 
the spot price of palladium on the new york merc fell to 165 a 
troy ounce 20 below the 8year high reached last thursday on 
speculation that demand for the white metal would explode in the 
wake of a startling fusion experiment at the university of utah 
in that project scientists used both palladium and platinum as 
components in an experiment in which they claimed to have recreated 
in a jar of water the nuclear reaction that powers the sun and 
stars 
palladium and platinum futures prices fell sharply monday 
following weekend news reports that the utah finding was unlikely 
to stir significant new demand for the metals 
more speculators bailed out or took profits on tuesday despite 
utah chemistry professor b stanley pons announcement that more 
than 60 university and private laboratories had at least partially 
verified the results obtained by him and his research partner 
martin fleischmann of the university of southampton england 
no ones really sure what are the practical applications and 
how long it will take for it to reallly absorb into the market 
said jack barbanel director of futures trading with gruntal amp co 
a new york brokerage house 
platinum futures prices also fell but much more modestly than 
palladium and more in line with gold which slipped in reaction to 
the labor departments report of a lowerthanexpected 05 percent 
rise in consumer prices in march 
platinum settled 220 to 270 lower on the new york merc with 
july at 54850 a troy ounce on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold settled 270 to 350 lower with june at 38740 a troy 
ounce silver was 5 cents to 79 cents lower with may at 578 a 
troy ounce 
gasoline futures continued their strong advance on the new york 
merc on expectations that the american petroleum institutes weekly 
survey would show a drop in us gasoline supplies 
indeed the api reported after the close that gasoline stocks 
fell by 21 million barrels last week crude oil stocks were down 
57 million barrels and distillate stocks increased by 516000 
barrels 
in tuesdays trading west texas intermediate crude settled 3 
cents lower to 29 cents higher with may at 2151 a barrel heating 
oil was 21 cent to 1 cent lower with may at 5276 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 90 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with may 
at 7386 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade on a forecast for rain in the corn belt and 
signs that the united states is becoming stingier with its wheat 
exports 
wheat settled 1 cent to 3 cents lower with may at 407 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with may at 275 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cents lower with may at 198 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents lower to 1 cents higher with may at 
748 a bushel 
livestock and meat futures finished narrowly mixed in choppy 
lackluster trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle settled 25 cent lower to 28 cent higher with june 
at 7152 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 27 cent 
higher with may at 7645 cents a pound live hogs were 12 cent 
lower to 35 cent higher with june at 4650 cents a pound frozen

apple computer inc reported a 29 percent drop in its quarterly 
profit tuesday while lotus development corp said its earnings 
fell 71 percent 
apple the personal computer giant based in cupertino calif 
said earnings in its second fiscal quarter were hurt by previously 
announced problems with highcost computer memory chips 
apples net income fell to 564 million from 797 million 
while earnings per share were 44 cents compared to 61 cents for the 
second quarter of 1988 
net sales were 125 billion a 44 percent increase over the net 
sales of 867 million a year ago 
for the first six months of its fiscal year apple said its 
profit slipped to 1968 million or 154 per share from 201 
million or 153 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 265 
billion from 191 billion 
john sculley apples chairman and chief executive said the 
problem of an oversupply of chips bought at peak prices is now 
substantially behind us 
international sales accounted for 40 percent of total revenues 
during the second quarter the figure was 38 percent in the second 
quarter last year 
macintosh sales continue to record strong gains around the 
world said sculley 
in january the company fresh from a 16 percent profit jump in 
the first quarter said it expected earnings to drop significantly 
analysts predicted earnings per share would fall to 35 cents to 45 
cents 
the purchase of the 1 millionbit memory chips was made at a 
time when prices were high because of a worldwide shortage of the 
memory chip apple then increased its prices on the more expensive 
models of its macintosh system a move that hurt sales when 
customers favored less expensive systems 
in an effort to rekindle sales apple cut the prices on its 
higherpriced macintosh models 
we are well on our way to surpassing 5 billion in revenues 
this fiscal year sculley said today as we enter the second 
half of fiscal 1989 we are experiencing strong demand for our 
macintosh products particularly our two newest computers the 
se30 and the iicx 
lotus the cambridge massbased maker of personal computer 
software said firstquarter earnings fell to 53 million or 13 
cents a share from 183 million or 40 cents a share a year 
earlier revenue rose to 120 million from 1173 million a year 
earlier 
lotus hit a setback last fall when it announced that the newest 
version of the spreadsheet program lotus 123 the engine that has 
driven growth since 1983 was projected to be shipped in the second 
quarter of 1989 instead of the end of 1988 as planned 
company officials said tuesday that release 3 of 123 a 
threedimensional spreadsheet is being tested and is on schedule 
for june shipment 
firstquarter revenues came in as expected and were 
encouraged by a number of trends said jim manzi lotus president

the dollar fell tuesday in reaction to an 
inflation report that helped stocks and bonds gold prices also 
fell 
the labor department said consumer prices rose 05 percent in 
march which was in line with expectations and diminished concern 
that the federal reserve would tighten credit to slow the economy 
and quell inflation 
tight credit is bad for the stock and bond markets but it helps 
the dollar by encouraging foreign investors to buy dollars to take 
advantage of high us interest rates 
the government report confirmed that inflation has reached a 
higher plateau but nonetheless did not indicate inflation as severe 
as some had predicted 
it was just another indication to the interestrate players 
that perhaps the fed can sit back for the time being without 
forcing rates higher said scott horwitz a senior trader at the 
bank of boston in new york 
fridays news that the march producer price index rose only 04 
percent had already signaled the slowdown 
in london the dollar fell against the british pound it cost 
17185 to buy one pound more expensive than 17095 monday the 
pound also rose against the dollar in new york to 17164 from 
17133

the stock market surged to a new postcrash high 
in active trading tuesday after new economic data signaled 
moderation in the economy and helped ease fears about inflation 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials shot up 4161 points to 
237940 the highest level since the oct 19 1987 stock market 
collapse and well above its previous postcrash high of 234714 on 
feb 7 
tuesdays move was also the sharpest oneday rise since oct 20 
1988 when the bluechip indicator rose 4392 points 
in the broader market advancing issues outnumbered declining 
ones by about 11 to 5 in nationwide trading of new york stock 
exchangelisted stocks with 1047 issues up 471 down and 464 
unchanged 
share prices leaped at the opening following a sharp rally in 
the bond market on news that housing starts were down dramatically 
and consumer prices were in line with expectations 
the commerce department reported that housing starts fell 54 
percent last month amid rising mortgage rates while applications 
for building permits plunged 137 percent 
although the housing numbers raised recession concerns stock 
analysts said the market interpreted the report as good news 
because it signaled a slowing economy which could lead to lower 
inflation 
consumer prices jumped 05 percent in march slightly below 
market expectations of about 06 percent according to a report 
from the labor department 
the number was not better than expected but within 
expectations said jack garry equity analyst with butcher amp 
singer inc the market is still concerned about inflation but the 
figures were encouraging the economy appears to be headed in the 
right direction 
the reports also raised the prospect that the federal reserve 
would avert further credit tightening 
the rise in the bond market and decline in interest rates 
suggests at a minimum that the federal reserve is not going to 
tighten credit further and is going to be under pressure to 
lean in the other direction that is ease monetary policy said

the internal revenue service has ruled that 
long island lighting co can write off losses it would sustain as a 
result of a plan to scrap the shoreham nuclear power plant utility 
officials said tuesday 
the decision will allow lilco to write off some 28 billion in 
losses it anticipates if it wins approval of a deal to sell 
shoreham to the state which would then dismantle it lilco 
spokesman jim lois said 
the irss latest ruling confirmed its sept 15 decision to allow 
lilco to write off losses from an earlier plan to dismantle 
shoreham he said that plan which had required approval of the 
state legislature fell apart when lawmakers declined to vote and 
the deal expired 
but new york gov mario cuomo and lilco reached a new settlement 
earlier this year which did not require legislative approval the 
new agreement which would sell shoreham to the state for 1 in 
exchange for a decade of annual rate increases of up to 5 percent 
is one step away from approval 
i guess what the irs did is they reviewed the new settlement 
agreement realized its fundamentally the same for tax purposes as 
the agreement of 1988 and have isued a letter ruling that we 
received today confirming our entitlement to a tax writeoff lois 
said 
the irs ruling came one day after the nuclear regulatory 
commission staff reported that the embattled 55 billion plant 
meets all federal safety requirements and is operationally 
ready nrc chairman lando zech tentatively set a vote on the 
fullpower license for thursday and all indications are the license 
will be granted 
however the action may be largely symbolic under the latest 
shutdown plan lilco has agreed not to put the license to use until 
its shareholders vote on the negotiated settlement that vote must 
take place on or before june 15 and lilco chairman william j 
catacosinos told the nrc monday that the utilitys board will 
recommend that shareholders approve the deal 
lilco and the state would then seek to have shorehams license 
transferred to the long island power authority and the new york 
power authority would oversee decommissioning and dismantling of 
the plant 
however the department of energy has said it would attempt to 
block transfer of the license although a doe spokesman said monday 
that strategy was still being worked out

president bush scored points with organized 
labor tuesday in his first postelection speech to a union audience 
but avoided any talk of his positions on the eastern airlines 
strike and minimum wage which have soured labors relations with 
the new administration 
i want this door at the white house to stay open bush told 
about 3000 delegates representing building trades unions from 
across the country i want to work with you 
the closest bush came to discussing his recent differences with 
labor was when he told the delegates theres a lot more to the 
relationship between the white house and the labor organizations 
than one issue or another we have had honest differences but 
we agree on goals and what matters is that we make progress on 
issues of shared concern 
bush was received politely by the union delegates but came under 
fire later in the day on capitol hill where democrats leading the 
laborbacked effort to raise the minimum wage chastised the 
president for refusing to negotiate with them and accused him of 
turning his back on the nations working poor 
president bush has been poorly advised to test his political 
muscle on innocent victims of an inadequate minimum wage the old 
the young the disadvantaged and even the ambitious trying to pay 
the escalating cost of education said rep austin murphy dpa 
the democrats compared bushs promise to veto their minimumwage 
bill with his efforts to expand capital gains tax breaks a 
proposal whose benefits would primarily be enjoyed predominantly by 
wealthy americans 
the president ought to have as much concern for the poor as he 
does for the rich said senate majority leader george mitchell 
labor had several visible confrontations with former president 
reagan on issues like the firing of striking air traffic 
controllers and white house opposition to legislation requiring 
employers to give workers advance notice of plant closings but 
labors lasting resentment toward bushs predecessor stems more 
from what they considered to be staunchly antiunion appointments 
to the national labor relations board 
bush took pains to avoid exciting the labor animosity that 
flourished during the reagan years he praised the already cordial 
crowd and improved his standing with labor leaders by promising to 
make nlrb appointments whose neutrality and integrity are above 
reproach 
my appointments will not be antilabor or as i say 
antibusiness they will be based on fair trade bush said as a 
shout of amen was heard from one texas delegate in the 
applauding audience 
that is indeed a welcome step said aflcio spokesman rex 
hardesty 
bush also praised the groups patriotism role in the nations 
economic growth and efforts on behalf of polands solidarity 
movement saying wherever the free trade movement is threatened 
so too is democracy 
but noticeably missing from the speech were any direct 
references to bushs promise to veto minimum wage bills that have 
cleared the house and senate or his refusal to intervene to block a 
strike that has grounded eastern for nearly two months 
union leaders said the omissions were not surprising 
i wouldnt expect him to discuss those fronts said hardesty 
it might have turned the audience against him real fast 
said another union official who asked not to be identified 
bush has promised to veto the minimum wage measures because they 
would raise the base wage to 455 an hour 30 cents an hour more 
than the president supports and do not contain a provision 
allowing all new employees to be paid a subminimum wage for six 
months bush has said such a training wage must be part of any 
minimum wage increase for him to support it 
in refusing to exercise his authority to block the eastern 
strike bush became the first president to ignore a recommendation 
of the national mediation board 
those decisions have soured the early tone of labors relations 
with the bush white house but labor leaders still view bush far 
more favorably than they did reagan 
and the group he appeared before tuesday was among the safest of 
union audiences for bush the president of the aflcio building and 
construction trades department robert a georgine is a longtime 
acquaintance of the president and among the unions represented at 
the conference was the teamsters the only major union to endorse 
bush in the presidential race 
georgine introduced bush as one of the finest individuals this 
country has ever produced and said the president can differ 
with you philosophically or politically and still hold your 
respect and you his 
bush was warmly received by the delegates who gave him standing 
ovations when he entered and left missing however was the 
cheering and other signs of enthusiasm that punctuated ovations 
monday for house speaker jim wright and mitchell 
mitchell told the delegates the president is against us and 
had urged them to question bush about the minimum wage but there 
was no opportunity for them to do so

paramount pictures and a local movie theater are 
not responsible for the death of a teenager who was knifed by a 
young man who had just seen the 1979 film the warriors a 
massachusetts court ruled tuesday 
the victims family had filed suit against paramount and the 
saxon theatre corp seeking damages on the grounds of wrongful 
death they charged that paramount and the theater knew that the 
warriors was inciting violence around the country 
in superior court judge harold flannery dismissed the suit on 
the grounds that the moviemaker and theater had no special 
relationship to the dead youth and therefore had no duty to 
protect him from his attacker 
when the family appealed the state supreme court decided to 
hear the case in a unanimous ruling written by justice francis 
oconnor the high court upheld the dismissal but added that the 
defendants were protected by constitutional rights 
although the film is rife with violent scenes it does not at 
any point exhort urge entreat solicit or overtly advocate or 
encourage unlawful or violent activity on the part of viewers 
oconnor wrote it does not create the likelihood of inciting or 
producing imminent lawless action that would strip the film of 
first amenment protection 
the suit was filed in 1981 by william yakubowicz on behalf of 
his dead son martin against paramount and saxon 
the complaint charged that 16yearold martin died from a knife 
wound inflicted on the night of feb 15 1979 by michael barrett 
who was returning from seeing the warriors at saxons theater 
on tremont street in boston 
according to court records two other youths had been killed 
near theaters showing the warriors in palm springs and oxnard 
calif just three days before yakubowicz was stabbed in boston 
that same week paramount officers advised theaters showing the 
film to hire security guards and offered to pay for them 
after viewing the film themselves the supreme court justices 
rejected the familys argument that the warriors was an 
incitement to illegal violence for that reason the court held 
paramount blameless in making it and saxon blameless in showing it

the government on tuesday unveiled the broad 
outlines of a plan for states to help poor families get off welfare 
and become selfsufficient by requiring aid recipients to 
participate in education job training and work programs 
the plan provides that one parent in twoparent welfare families 
will have to work at least 16 hours a week in the public or private 
sector as a condition for receiving benefits and single welfare 
parents with children 3 years or older will have to participate in 
employment and training programs also teenage parents who have 
not completed high school will be required to return to school or 
work toward an equivalent degree 
the plan requires states to guarantee child care for parents who 
participate in the education and training programs 
the department of health and human services outlined the plan in 
proposed regulations to implement the job opportunities and basic 
skills training program a 33 billion fiveyear initiative 
passed by congress last year as part of the family support act 
the legislation was the first major overhaul of the countrys 
welfare system in a halfcentury 
the regulations published in tuesdays federal register are 
open to public comment for 60 days the department is to issue 
final rules by october 
states initially will have to bring 7 percent of their caseload 
in aid to families with dependent children programs under the new 
plan and by 1994 will be required to have 20 percent in the 
program 
kathy patterson of the american public welfare association 
which represents the state human services agencies that will 
implement the program said the association remains concerned that 
the participation rates dont reflect realistic performance 
goals 
as a result she said states may wind up channeling people 
through meaningless tasks to meet the terms of the law 
alica smith of the national governors association said the 
regulations require single parents with children 3 years old and 
older to spend 35 hours a week in employment and training programs 
to be counted as a jobs participant but some of these programs do 
not meet for 35 hours a week so welfare agencies will have to find 
something else for people in those programs to do to count them as 
participants 
hhs secretary louis sullivan speaking at a news conference 
called the law and the regulations a turning point for our 
nations welfare system 
at a time when as many as one in four american children are 
born into poverty the jobs program will be especially important in 
helping to break the generational cycle of longterm dependency 
he said 
the regulations set out the framework within which each state 
will design its jobs program any state that doesnt comply risks 
losing federal funds for afdc the primary government assistance 
program for poor families about 90 percent of such families are 
headed by women 
sullivan estimated that up to 138000 families will be able to 
leave the welfare rolls over the next five years and said that is 
only a beginning about 35 million families receive afdc which 
costs the federal government about 85 billion a year states 
match the federal share with their own funds 
the jobs program is expected to cost the federal government 
about 33 billion over the next five years sullivan said states 
must match the federal money with at least 50 percent of their own 
money the matching rates vary among the different sections of the 
program 
state programs are required to be in place by oct 1 1990 but 
states may have their plans approved by the department of health 
and human services and in place on july 1 of this year seventeen 
states and the district of columbia have told hhs they want to 
begin their programs in july officials said 
those states are arkansas california connecticut georgia 
iowa maryland massachusetts michigan minnesota nevada new 
jersey ohio oklahoma rhode island south carolina virginia and 
wisconsin

firstquarter profit climbed 824 percent despite the sizeable 
costs of a bitter eightmonth battle to stave off a takeover 
attempt

first quarter compared with 142 million or 23 cents a share in 
the first quarter of 1988

other expenses 
operating profits nearly tripled to 734 million from 262 
million in the same period in 1988 
i macallister booth polaroid president and chief executive

lockheed corp said tuesday its first 
quarter profit plummeted 43 percent due primarily to the 
completion of a major air force cargo plane order and an increase 
in its effective tax rate 
net earnings which included discontinued operations were 62 
million or 104 per share compared with 114 million or 184 
per share for the same period of 1988 
sales for the first quarter totaled 2 billion down from 
revenue of 24 billion in the first quarter of 1988 
lockheed chairman daniel m tellep said the downturn was in line 
with company expectations noted in an april 4 reorganization 
announcement 
tellep blamed the earnings decline primarily on completion of 
the 50plane c5b cargo jet production program and an increase in 
the effective tax rate 
adjustments of about 10 million for cost increases on two 
aircraft modification programs and the timing of c130 transport 
deliveries also contributed to the downturn in revenues and program 
profits he said 
the aerospace company delivered four c130s in the first three 
months of 1989 compared with 10 of the aircraft during the same 
period a year ago tellep stressed that c130 deliveries for all of 
1989 were expected to be comparable to the 36 delivered last year

the senate on tuesday rejected an effort to 
add the 50 billion taxpayer share of a savings and loan bailout to 
the fiscal 1989 budget a move that could have stuck president bush 
with the biggest federal deficit in history 
on a 5048 vote the senate rejected a move by sen bob graham 
dfla to waive provisions of the 1985 grammrudman deficit 
reduction law in order to balloon this years deficit to at least 
2133 billion to pay for the bailout 
under the budget reduction law waiving its provisions would 
have required 60 votes 
graham said financing the bailout costs through direct 
borrowings by the treasury rather than through a complex 
alternative offbudget scheme wanted by bush would save taxpayers 
45 billion over 30 years or 150 million annually in lower 
interest costs 
were the generation that created this horrendous problem 
that cut the cake at the party but were not the ones who are 
going to pay for it he said since were transferring the 
costs to our children and grandchildren the least we can do is be 
honest about it and try to lower the costs 
sen jake garn rutah questioned whether the savings through 
grahams effort would ever materialize predicting the interest 
costs on the entire federal debt could rise by as much 500 million 
if it jumped by 50 billion at once 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and other administration 
officials have repeatedly said they would recommend that bush veto 
any bailout package that tampered with his financing scheme 
citing estimates that the bailouts costs are growing by 500 
million to 1 billion a month garn said if we delay this bill 
for a few months because of a fight over a veto weve eaten up all 
the savings in grahams plan 
the official estimate for the budget deficit for the current 
fiscal year ending next sept 30 is 1633 billion or 273 
billion over the 136 billion grammrudman target set in september 
1987 but officials expect it to swell by several billion dollars 
more if interest rates do not fall or if the economy slows down 
dumping the bailout costs into the budget would have swelled the 
deficit to 2133 billion just 88 billion below the record 
2211 billion in 1986 under president reagan 
earlier tuesday the senate gave voice vote approval to an 
amendment by sen john heinz rpa to expand the racketeering 
influence and corrupt organizations act to include crimes against 
sampls banks and other financial institutions and the federal 
deposit insurance system 
senators who privately negotiated the sampl rescue package with 
the administration over the past two weeks beat back other efforts 
to weaken bushs control over the bailout 
by 6632 the senate defeated an amendment by sen bob kerrey 
dneb which would have substituted an independent board for one 
dominated by cabinet members to sell some 400 billion in real 
estate the government is inheriting as a result of the sampl crisis 
the vote may have reflected senators desire for an 11day 
recess as much as an endorsement of bushs sampl plan which over the 
next 30 years will cost a minimum of 260 billion twothirds of it 
from taxpayers 
i know how the herd instinct works around here said sen 
dale bumpers dark who supported kerreys amendment they can 
smell that recess hour he said of his fellow senators 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine repeated his threat to 
call the senate back in on friday and next week if necessary if 
the bailout package is not approved by wednesday afternoon 
otherwise the senate would not meet again until may 1 
the 564page bill was negotiated with the administration two 
weeks ago largely through three behindcloseddoor caucuses among 
the 12 democrats and nine republicans on the senate banking 
committee 
similar legislation is being examined in the house where the 
banking committee is to begin acting on amendments next week 
the senate panels chairman sen donald riegle dmich and 
garn its ranking republican pleaded with members not to offer 
amendments saying it would upset the delicate balance of a complex 
package 
we simply cannot afford bickering and delays said garn 
citing estimates that the problem will continue to grow by 1 
billion a month until the rescue package is put in place 
however senators not on the banking committee expressed 
resentment at the efforts by its leaders to rush action on the bill 
the banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom 
said bumpers to suggest that this document is sacred and every 
word infallible and if the other 80 senators not on the 
banking committee have no say we may as well just go home 
now 
sen christopher dodd dconn a committee member said the 
vote defeating kerreys amendment indicated other attempts to alter 
the package also will be rejected even ones that have some 
merit 
once you start making exceptions you run the risk of 
losing the balance he said 
kerreys amendment would have established an independent 
sevenmember board to run the resolution trust corp a new agency 
that will take control of all the assets or loans of failed sampls 
and the real estate that secured them revenues from the sale of 
the real estate are to be used to reduce taxpayers costs 
bush wanted the new agency to operate under a threemember board 
made up of brady attorney general dick thornburgh and federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan 
the senate committees compromise calls for a fivemember board 
that would include two members appointed from the private sector in 
addition to brady thornburgh and greenspan 
because the board will have control over the greatest 
concentration of land buildings and real estate ever amassed in 
the nations history kerrey said the potential for a political 
scandal is unprecedented 
other senators however said they want to have a board 
controlled by bush cabinet members in order to be able to hold the 
administration accountable if problems arise 
often independent boards outside the control of an 
administration become captives of interests said sen paul 
sarbanes dmd
