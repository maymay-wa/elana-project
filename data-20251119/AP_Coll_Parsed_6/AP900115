a telephone company circuit failure halted 
delivery of markets data monday from the new york and american 
stock exchanges to the associated press 
as a result some of the stock tables compiled and transmitted 
by the ap were delayed and others did not reflect final closing 
prices for some stocks 
the ap has two sets of phone circuits from the exchanges and 
both the prime and backup circuits failed in the outage said john 
reid ap director of communications and technology 
in each of the two sets there are two wires which means the 
information from the exchanges actually is delivered four different 
ways all four of the wires failed he said 
the outage occurred when cables were damaged by flooding in a 
major new york telephone circuit building in the citys financial 
district the trouble was not related to widespread longdistance 
calling problems experienced monday by american telephone amp 
telegraph co reid said

defense secretary dick cheney said monday he has 
no plans to allow american servicewomen in combat despite 
complaints from some female soldiers and a call to do so from a 
congresswoman 
my own personal view is that the current system is about 
right cheney said at a news conference weve worked to expand 
opportunity for women as much as possible its a continuing 
process of opening up various occupational specialties where we 
think its appropriate 
sgt rhonda maskus of the army 82nd airborne division based at 
fort bragg nc has filed a discrimination complaint against the 
army alleging a male soldier was selected over her for the recent 
panama mission despite her expertise as an intelligence analyst on 
panama 
army policy bars women from combat roles although several women 
were engaged in combat in panama 
in addition rep patricia schroeder dcolo has said she will 
introduce a bill that would allow female military personnel into 
combat 
but cheney drew the line monday saying i think there are 
situations in the nature of modern warfare that women assigned to 
various combat support units or to mp military police units 
for example as was the case in panama will in fact end up in 
combat and have to defend themselves accordingly 
thats a different proposition from taking a unit that has a 
specific combat role and saying we ought to change the makeup of 
that unit and include women to fill those roles as a general 
proposition i think the current exclusion from certain types of 
unit is appropriate

when congress reconvenes later this month it 
must deal with the ethics problems of 11 members including five 
senators who intervened with banking regulators and three house 
members accused of improper sexual behavior 
the list includes the no 2ranking senate democrat the 
secondranking house republican the chairman of the senate banking 
committee a onetime prisoner of war in vietnam and americas 
bestknown former astronaut 
the senate ethics committee is looking into the conduct of seven 
senators including the keating five accused of improperly 
intervening with federal banking regulators on behalf of the owner 
of the failed lincoln savings and loan 
however none of the four house cases is expected to equal the 
political drama of the investigation that led to speaker jim 
wrights resignation last year 
most people like their congressman but have a negative opinion 
of the elective body as a whole said rep henry hyde rill 
he said that explains why incumbents generally win reelection 
despite investigations like the lincoln case which he said 
stereotypes members of congress as arrogant selfish tools of 
special interests 
none of the senators under investigation is up for reelection 
this year while house members face the voters every two years 
the keating five senators are republican john mccain of 
arizona a former pow in vietnam majority whip alan cranston of 
california banking committee chairman donald w riegle jr of 
michigan dennis deconcini of arizona and former astronaut john 
glenn of ohio 
they intervened with banking regulators on behalf of charles h 
keating jr when he sought relief from an intense government 
examination of the californiabased thrift 
keating his relatives and employees contributed 13 million to 
the five senators campaigns and political causes 
others who face scrutiny are sens alfonse m damato rny 
and david durenberger rminn house republican whip newt gingrich 
of georgia rep gus savage dill rep donald e buz lukens 
rohio and rep barney frank dmass 
the house and senate ethics committees have launched formal 
investigations in all except gingrichs case the house panel must 
decide whether to pursue that inquiry despite an outside counsels 
recommendation to drop the case 
in durenbergers case the committee is investigating whether he 
sought to evade limits on speaking fees he earned on a book 
promotion tour and whether he improperly profited by charging the 
senate for rent on a minneapolis condominium he coowned 
a complaint by a political opponent of damato said the senator 
steered federal housing projects to his political supporters and 
improperly peddled his influence in other matters 
in the house rep bill alexander dark has complained that 
gingrich violated house rules and federal campaign finance laws by 
getting 21 investors to put up 5000 each to promote a book he 
coauthored alexander also complained of alleged violations in a 
number of other areas 
the committee also is investigating 
frank an admitted homosexual who has acknowledged paying male 
prostitute stephen gobie 80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently 
hiring him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver 
from july 1985 through august 1987 
frank has denied gobies allegations that the lawmaker was aware 
that gobie ran a prostitution ring from the congressmans 
apartment and that gobie and frank engaged in sexual activity at 
the house gym 
savage who is fighting allegations that he sexually assaulted 
a peace corps volunteer while on an official trip to zaire last 
march savage has said they tried to destroy dr martin luther 
king with a lie im in very good company 
lukens rohio convicted in may of contributing to the 
unruliness of a minor for having sex with a 16yearold girl he 
was sentenced to 30 days in jail and a 500 fine but is appealing 
while remaining free on bond 
some of the lawmakers under investigation have resorted to 
extraordinary measures to proclaim their innocence including 
television commercials newspaper advertisements hiring 
experienced defense lawyers and building up defense war chests 
durenberger made an unusual apology to the people of minnesota

lawyers travel agents business executives 
and public relations men are flocking to eastern europe as if it 
were the promised land hoping to make connections that will pay 
off in the future 
while optimistic entrepreneurs see potential pots of gold at the 
end of eastern european rainbows few people today say they are 
making money in nations turning from communism to capitalism 
but many say they need to enter the markets at the ground floor 
cultivating contacts and learning language and cultural skills 
unique to the potentially lucrative markets 
despite difficulties bureaucrats in poland are so overwhelmed 
they sometimes schedule 10 pm business meetings and telephone 
communications into romania are spotty executives say its a good 
time to lay a foundation for doing business 
poland is where germany was after world war ii said john 
adams a public relations executive who chairs the worldcom group 
a consortium of public relations companies that has opened an 
office in warsaw 
adams predicted a booming market in five years adding 
companies are not looking for a quick buck 
there is no money right now echoed david handler a program 
director at the bostonbased sabre foundation a nonprofit 
educational and scientific organization that promotes free 
enterprise 
in fact the commerce department has been very candid about 
warning americans theyre unlikely to stumble on any getrichquick 
schemes in eastern europe said susanne lotarski director of the 
departments office of east european and soviet affairs 
most of the economies in the region have various degrees of 
economic problems she said 
nonetheless lotarski said her office is fielding 10 times as 
many inquiries as last year from american companies and 
corporations 
firms dealing in agriculture health care telecommunications 
pollution control energy savings tourism and housing problably 
will have the best chance of penetrating the eastern european 
markets she said 
the price of entry for anyone into eastern europe is quite 
low said handler of the sabre foundation his group is 
encouraging companies to donate equipment and products to poland as 
a means to gain identification he said 
pfizer inc the medical company donated 100000 in 
pharmaceuticals for animals in poland he said 
a number of americans are so keen to enter eastern europe that 
they are working for free 
jeffrey burt a partner at the law firm of arnold amp porter said 
the firm provided the polish government with two free lawyers to 
pursue privatization efforts 
others are hoping the contacts they made before the iron curtain 
fell will blossom 
frank mankiewicz of hill amp knowlton said he was recently in 
budapest hungary where the public relations company has a client 
the central bank of hungary hill amp knowlton is courting other 
clients there he said 
edward j von kloberg whose von kloberg amp associates worked for 
the government of deposed romanian leader nicolae ceausescu said 
he still represents romania even though the hated president was 
overthrown and executed 
von kloberg sometimes arranged for the placement of 
proceausescu articles in newspapers like the journal of commerce 
according to records on file at the justice departments office of 
foreign agent registration he received 15000 from romania in 
january 1988 
business people arent the only americans with a thirst for 
eastern europe 
travel agents are flooded with requests from travelers seeking 
new adventures in countries that are still relatively inexpensive 
said francis goranin of vega international travel services in 
chicago 
goranin who has long specialized in travel behind the iron 
curtain said it can be difficult for americans traveling on their 
own to find good accommodations 
the good hotels in hungary are full most of the time and 
czechoslovakia is a similar story he said the marriott corp 
recently opened a hotel in poland and bulgaria is anxious to 
develop its black sea resorts

bombings in the south and random acts of violence and vandalism 
across the country have given rise to fears that a new wave of 
racially and ethnically motivated crime is sweeping the united 
states 
nearly every day brings a fresh report from somewhere from 
portland ore where skinheads were charged with beating a 
15yearold hispanic girl from wellesley mass where two young 
men were arrested for spraypainting swastikas and racist slogans 
on walls from new york city where a gang of white youths was 
charged with killing a black man who crossed into their turf 
new organizations have sprung up to fight racism and police 
judges and legislators are taking a harder look at what they can do 
to prevent such crime 
but among those who closely monitor what are commonly called 
hate crimes there is disagreement about whether racism is 
really resurgent some argue that only the reporting of racial 
crime has increased not the crime itself 
the paradox is that the better you are at reporting the worse 
your picture is going to look said col leonard supenski who 
heads the police crime prevention bureau in baltimore county md 
supenski speaks from experience his police department whose 
beat ranges over 610 square miles from the industrial edge of 
baltimore to horse country near the pennsylvania border was one of 
the first in the nation to begin reporting hate crimes in a 
category of their own 
baltimore county has kept statistics on rres racial religious 
and ethnic incidents since 1979 and its figures show a slight 
increase last year after four years of decline 
the increase could be the result of a more sensitive police 
force quicker to recognize a racist motive behind a crime it 
could be the result of a more trusting public more likely to 
report a crime or it could just be part of what supenski calls the 
ebb and flow of crime 
only a handful of cities around the nation have kept track of 
hate crimes for very long one is new york city where bias 
crimes were down slightly during the first 10 months of 1989 
they had been down sharply until aug 23 when a gang of whites 
surrounded a 16yearold black youth yusuf hawkins and shot him 
to death on a brooklyn street ripples of lesser racial incidents 
tauntings beatings spread across the city 
inspector paul m sanderson who heads the new york police 
departments bias crime unit isnt persuaded that racist crime is 
really changing 
there is no pattern he said 
sanderson 54 is black and recalls hate crime in his youth 
although it wasnt called that 
i grew up here and i know what went on in this city he 
said and i know that if you went up to a cop and said i 
was hit in the head with a baseball bat and i got the injury 
because im black and i was in a white neighborhood hed say 
get out of here kid go on home 
still for every paul sanderson or leonard supenski there are 
others who say racist crime is getting worse they see neonazi 
skinheads pumping new life into the ku klux klan they hear about 
racism sprouting on college campuses and they can tick off lists 
of violent incidents around the country that have nothing in common 
but their motive prejudice 
one such person is bill tafoya who teaches longrange planning 
at the fbi academy in quantico va and moonlights at the 
congressional clearinghouse on the future a sort of institutional 
crystal ball his specialty is civil disorder 
tafoya has a simple test for gauging the ups and downs of 
racism every year he searches a computer database for references 
to four words or phrases racism or racist bigotry 
white supremacy and hate groups 
in 1980 those words appeared 767 times in the new york times 
and the washington post in 1988 the last full year for which 
tafoya has records they appeared 2122 times about a threefold 
increase 
tafoya concedes that those figures alone dont mean there has 
been an increase in racism it could just be increased interest in 
the subject but he believes the increase is real and says other 
researchers agree 
besides police have become interested in hate crime tafoya 
knows because hes constantly asked to lecture to them 
my warning to them is that if they turn away from the issue 
then theyre going to be in a very uncomfortable position of 
being in the middle when the lid blows off he said 
the message is not being ignored more police departments around 
the nation are beginning to follow the lead of baltimore county 
new york city and boston pioneers in establishing special 
programs to fight hate crime 
minneapolis started a bias crime program in 1987 philadelphia 
san francisco and portland ore are among other cities that now 
pay special attention to hate crime 
most such programs have two basic goals to keep separate 
reports on hate crimes so that investigators can spot patterns and 
to assure the public that such crimes will not be tolerated 
if the people dont have a sense that they can go the police 
and go to the courts theyre going to go to the streets 
explained sgt bill johnston who directs the boston police 
departments community disorders unit 
reporting is considered especially important there are no 
national statistics on hate crime now which is one reason that 
people disagree about it a bill pending in congress would require 
the justice department to collect such data 
those who follow the issue closely such as adele dutton terrell 
of the national institute against prejudice and violence say 
passage of the hate crime statistics act is essential 
people pay attention to hate group activity skinheads the 
kkk ms terrell said but when you read about crosses being 
burned into the lawn of a family that just moved in or asians or 
hispanics being harrassed people assume these are isolated cases 
we need the data to show thats not the case 
in the meantime at least 10 states have passed laws in the past 
few years requiring their police departments to collect data on 
hate crimes and lawmakers are finding other ways to battle racist 
crime 
according to the antidefamation league of bnai brith at 
least 31 states have passed laws making ethnic intimidation or 
harrassment a crime at least 34 states have made institutional 
vandalism a crime 
courts are also looking for innovative ways to combat racism in 
eugene ore last year a man convicted of racial intimidation was 
ordered to attend a racial awareness course in addition to serving 
60 days in jail 
and last july in montgomery ala seven ku klux klan members 
agreed to attend a similar course as part of an outofcourt 
settlement of a civil lawsuit filed by the southern christian 
leadership conference 
no one believes these measures are going to end racial hatred or 
stop racial violence that will require more basic social change 
some hold the economic system responsible others say the failure 
has been in the schools still others say any change must take 
place in homes in churches or in peoples hearts 
were doing badly in shaping people and preparing them to go 
out and get along in life and to exist and interact with other 
people in a civilized fashion said sanderson of the nypd 
were all responsible

natures way of recycling water gets some 
wet and wild twists in machines bill williamson builds to clean up 
hazardous wastes for industries ranging from nuclear power to 
perfume 
theres a whole new science that weve got to learn said 
williamson 74 whos been experimenting with evaporation and 
condensation since world war ii when he developed machines that 
distilled sea water aboard warships 
williamson a mechanical engineer turned his attention to 
fighting pollution 14 years ago when he and his sons bruce and 
rod founded the small but fastgrowing licon inc in pensacola 
we are doing some weird things some smart physical chemists 
when they see what we are doing they just throw up their hands 
he said 
licon produces evaporators that clean up wastewater and let 
industries concentrate and reuse toxic metals and chemicals that 
once went down the drain into the environment some plants that use 
the machines dont even have sewers 
the evaporators with a patented heat exchanger operate at 
relatively low temperatures high efficiency and low cost said rod 
williamson they can treat wastewater for 1 or 2 cents a gallon 
compared to as much as 12 cents for other machines and up to 2 for 
disposal in a hazardous waste dump he said 
one is being tested at the three mile island nuclear plant 
nupac services plans to use it to decontaminate 23 million gallons 
of water irradiated in the 1979 accident that shut down the 
harrisburg pa plant 
licon evaporators which cost 14000 to 250000 are in use in 
the united states canada and europe most are in metal plating 
plants although one is cleaning up shampoo wastes at an alberto 
culver plant in puerto rico 
customers can be found in nearly any industry that produces 
liquid hazardous waste but there are limits rod williamson said 
some industries including paper mills and chemical factories 
produce too much wastewater to be efficiently treated with 
evaporators now being produced he said 
bill williamson who holds 30 patents said the key to the 
machines is low air pressure when boiled even freshwater leaves a 
scale although the residue is much worse with saltwater or 
wastewater and would quickly foul and corrode a conventional 
evaporator he said he discovered that heating water in a whole or 
partial vacuum thereby lowering its boiling point would reduce 
the scale and permit recovering specific salts for reuse the 
machines also reuse heat the way a heat pump improves a home 
heating and air conditioning system 
williamson began working on desalinization while employed by 
maxim silencer corp which specialized in equipment to muffle 
diesel engines it was asked to develop a way to purify saltwater 
aboard coast guard cutters so that they could escort convoys in 
world war ii the cutters were too small to carry enough fuel and 
water to cross the ocean but could make the trip if water storage 
areas were used instead for fuel oil he said 
the company rented a beachfront house at clinton conn to test 
the machine its resemblance to a moonshiners still prompted 
neighbors to call the police at first officers who raided the 
place didnt believe the machine was producing nothing stronger 
than water but they looked at it and tasted it and said ok 
williamson said 
he later worked on similar equipment for nuclear submarines and 
in 1970 helped set up a desalting test station near the panhandle 
resort town of destin for mechanical equipment co of new orleans 
williamson and his sons then formed licon short for liquid 
conditioning or liquid concentration and built its first 
evaporator in his garage out of pipe fittings and other parts they 
bought or made

wang has a wife and baby a secure government job 
and no particular interest in politics until recently he never 
thought about leaving china 
but since june he has become obsessed with the idea to the 
point that he says he can hardly concentrate on his work he and a 
friend spend hours debating the best way leave they think its 
best to leave as a student and that the best place to go is 
australia 
if he succeeds he will leave behind his wife and child 
probably never to return she understands wang said she 
knows i cant live here 
uncalculated thousands of chinas besteducated people many of 
them young have reached the same conclusion since june when the 
chinese army opened fire on prodemocracy protesters in beijing 
their idealistic dreams of saving china shattered many students 
now say they are only interested in saving themselves from 
political repression cultural tedium and economic hardships of 
socialist china 
study abroad was popular before june what has changed is that 
now virtually everyone with a college degree and many without one 
are talking about it even those with little or no foreign language 
skills 
schemes for getting overseas are getting wilder too an artist 
talked dreamily one week of seeking an invitation to exhibit his 
work abroad the next week realistically dropping that idea he 
proposed finding a foreign woman to marry 
i cant paint in this environment he said 
the us embassy said the number of applications for chinese 
governmentsponsored study abroad has dropped 
but the number of nongovernment students jumped by onethird 
compared to the previous year with 2424 receiving visas in the 
fiscal year that ended sept 30 the number of chinese going to 
visit relatives already studying in the united states more than 
tripled to 321 in the last three months of 1989 
student applications to go to canada another popular 
destination topped 3000 from june through december up more than 
50 percent from the same period in 1988 the canadian embassy said 
many of those now trying to leave say they are not interested in 
politics and many did not take part actively in the massive 
prodemocracy protests that preceded junes crackdown but they 
sympathized with the protesters demands for a freer society and 
regard the deluge of political rhetoric since june as the last 
straw 
most people are sick of the system said a young college 
graduate who is applying to study in the united states they 
dont want to get involved in politics but since june everyone has 
to read papers and make a statement about what he did during the 
protests people dont want to do that 
she acknowledged that many people seek riches abroad but she 
said money is only one factor in a qualityoflife equation that 
includes less bureaucracy more personal freedom and professional 
fulfillment 
they may have had good ideas but found out that they cant 
carry them out here she said they have no hope many people 
think that even if the government is overthrown it wont 
necessarily be better 
suggestions that china cannot reform or advance if its brightest 
youth go abroad rouse little interest one repeat applicant at the 
us embassy one of few chinese in his field shrugged and said 
we cant do anything here now 
the embassy tries to screen out anyone they suspect will not 
return to china 
so eager are many to leave that they were angered when 
washington said chinese students already in the united states could 
stay beyond their visas they feared china would retaliate by 
closing the door on study abroad 
the opening in the door already has narrowed and further 
narrowing is expected the government is expected to issue 
regulations this month requiring applicants for study abroad to 
first work at least five years in china 
since june many work units have begun requiring employees who 
go abroad to pay a personal bond in some cases as large as 12000 
yuan or about 2550 to be refunded when they come back 
applicants for the test of english as a foreign language 
required for entry to most us colleges now must obtain 
permission letters from their work unit or college department and 
students at beijing university say they have been refused the 
letters 
beijing university also has refused to give students course 
transcripts for foreign college applications unless the government 
is sponsoring their study abroad police reportedly are approving 
fewer passports although no figures are available 
all this has made the wouldbe emigres more anxious than ever 
a teenage girl called up a canadian woman sobbing and 
threatening to commit suicide if the woman did not help her get a 
visa to study in canada the next day the girls mother showed up 
on the womans doorstep with a gift of expensive embroidery 
i sent it back in the mail the canadian said i dont 
know if she got her visa

said william bennett is no saint 
lets just say hes not the brightest bulb in the christmas 
tree said robert george bennetts criminal defense lawyer 
and hes no altar boy 
by almost all accounts willie bennett is a tough excon whose 
criminal record dates back to 1964 including serving time for 
shooting a police officer 
bennett is currently being held on 35000 bail since his arrest 
on a motor vehicle violation nov 1 
charles stuarts suicide after he found out he had become the 
polices prime suspect in his wifes killing cleared bennett in 
the case bennett had never been charged with the crime but he had 
been named frequently in police leaks to reporters stuart also had 
picked him out of a police lineup 
hes done his time he showed he was a man said veda 
bennett 29 who was home with her mother the night boston police 
kicked in the door of their apartment and ransacked it 
john julian a spokesman for suffolk county district attorney 
newman flanagan said all search warrants and affidavits in the 
bennett investigation were aboveboard 
bennett 39 was born and raised in bostons mission hill the 
innercity neighborhood that gained national notoriety after stuart 
told police a black mugger robbed and shot him and his wife after

firing up the charcoal and throwing a piece of 
meat on top has prehistoric roots according to a museum curator 
charles finsley earth sciences curator of the dallas museum of 
natural history said evidence exists that shows those who lived in 
texas 10000 to 15000 years ago barbecued a variety of animals 
he is fairly certain that was the fate of a huge mammoth whose 
fossilized bones went on display for the first time sunday 
there is a suspicious number of charred areas places 
apparently blackened by fire and pieces of charcoal were found 
under the bones finsley said 
the mammoth remains were discovered in november by barry leon 
an amateur paleontologist finsley said more excavations are 
planned at the site along the sulphur river in northeast texas 
the animal a large elephantlike creature that would have stood 
14 feet tall and weighed about 14 tons is believed to be about 
12000 years old 
i think it would have taken about a 55gallon drum of barbecue 
sauce said finsley 
while it becomes clear that prehistoric texans were fond of 
barbecue finsley says he couldnt in good conscience say that it 
was a texas invention 
you never know he said maybe those early people wandered 
down from kansas city

a package of ethics bills is on a fast 
track in the state senate as a verdict on federal corruption 
charges looms against one legislator and the specter of more 
indictments hovers 
the ethics package already has reached the state senate floor a 
little over a week after it was introduced by the upper houses 
leaders who complain that the trial of sen joseph montoya and a 
continuing fbi probe has unfairly tarnished legislators 
reputations 
were on the fast track as fast as we can get the votes 
said senate president pro tem david roberti a democrat 
these are not happy times for usadded senate minority 
leader ken maddy a republican 
the bills would bar legislators and other elected state 
officials from accepting honorariums limit the value of gifts they 
can receive from most sources and impose tougher 
conflictofinterest restrictions 
the three measures would put into effect portions of a state 
constitutional amendment that lawmakers last year approved for the 
june 1990 ballot 
the amendment also would create a pay commission to set salary 
levels for legislators and other top state officials a provision 
that critics say could result in unlimited raises and could cause 
voters to sink the entire package 
currently there is a 5 percentperyear limit on legislators 
salary hikes legislators now receive 40816 a year although 
their pay averages about 56000 when their 88perday living 
expense provision stateleased car payments and unlimited gasoline 
credit card are factored in 
the legislatures image has been taking a beating since fbi 
agents raided the offices of four lawmakers late one night in 
august 1988 revealing a corruption investigation that had been 
going on for three years no other lawmakers have been charged but 
there is speculation some of them might be 
montoya was indicted last may he went on trial in early 
december on 12 felony counts of bribery extortion racketeering 
and money laundering montoya a democrat from the los angeles 
suburb of el monte who has been in the legislature 17 years faces 
a maximum of 220 years in prison and more than 3 million in fines 
to start off the new year a los angeles times poll reported 
that 53 percent of 1594 voters questioned felt that taking 
bribes is relatively common practice among california legislators 
in addition seven out of 10 of those surveyed favored a limit 
on lawmakers terms a concept that legislators fear may reach the 
ballot this year through an initiative drive 
events have been such that we have the momentum to push this 
through sen john doolittle republican caucus chairman said of 
the pending legislation 
the assembly hasnt been quite so quick to respond a hearing on 
ethics legislation was postponed last wednesday assembly speaker 
willie brown said because the bills werent ready 
we should not pass a bill only to deal with the image 
problem he said you should not give dracula the quart of 
blood he needs for a quick fix 
prosecutors claim that montoya the chairman of the senate 
business and professions committee put his vote and political 
influence up for sale in an attempt to become wealthy 
the centerpiece of their case is a videotape showing montoya 
accepting a 3000 check from an undercover fbi agent the agent 
was posing as the head of a fictional shrimpimporting company that 
wanted legislation passed to help it out 
prosecutors claim that the check was a payoff for montoyas 
efforts to move the bill through the senate defense attorneys 
contend the money was a legal honorarium even though montoya 
received the check at a breakfast meeting with the agent and a 
senate aide and did not give a speech the usual reason for an 
honorarium 
there are also charges that montoya pressured people for money 
in return for his help with other legislation 
actor ed asner formerly head of the screen actors guild 
testified he once lobbied montoya to get his support for sags 
position on a pending bill during their meeting asner said he 
got the impression montoya would not support his position unless 
sag contributed to the senators campaign 
defense attorneys have tried to punch holes in the prosecutions 
case but have suffered a series of setbacks in rulings by judge 
milton schwartz 
in one ruling schwartz refused to let the defense ask other 
legislators about their motives in voting for the shrimp bill 
defense attorneys wanted to show that montoya could have had 
honorable reasons for helping the bill but schwartz said another 
lawmakers motives would not necessarily be the same as montoyas 
defense attorneys expect to wrap up their case this week 
prosecutors have refused to say if they plan additional 
indictments but there have been indications that more legislators 
might face charges 
the strongest sign came in november when an assembly aide 
pleaded guilty to helping extort 12500 for republican lawmakers 
and agreed to cooperate with the government in exchange for its 
recommendation of a mimimum sentence 
its a cooperative agreement us attorney david levi said 
you have to assume that we only enter into those agreements if we 
believe cooperation will be of value to us

signs advertising marlboro cigarettes and 
budweiser beer are appearing in childrens video arcade games 
outraging doctors who are trying to reduce teenage smoking 
the manufacturer of the games sega of america said the 
inclusion of the logos was simply a game designers innocent 
attempt to mimic reallife locations the statement was issued 
friday in response to an inquiry from the associated press 
one game super monaco gp includes buildings in which all of 
the windows have been replaced by the marlboro logo other sega 
games using the logos are hang on and power drift 
dave rosen cochairman of segas board said in the statement 
that there is absolutely no form of paid or intentional 
advertising displayed in any of segas arcade or consumer video 
games 
the company said it was in the process of removing the logos it 
did not say how many games have been made or how long they have 
been in use 
philip morris which makes marlboro cigarettes and anheuser 
busch the maker of budweiser said they had not authorized the use 
of their brand names or logos philip morris has asked sega to 
recall the games 
tobacco companies have been known to pay large sums for mention 
of their products philip morris for example paid 350000 for 
the placement of lark cigarettes in the james bond film licence 
to kill released last summer 
super monaco gp is essentially one big marlboro ad said dr 
john w richards of the medical college of georgia who has 
investigated the video advertisements 
a child playing super monaco gp is exposed to literally 
hundreds of marlboro ads during the game if hes good richards 
president of the antismoking group doctors ought to care wrote 
last month in a letter of complaint to the federal trade commission 
if hes not good and doesnt reach extended play then hell 
see only 50 or so marlboro ads 
the commission which regulates advertising said its policy 
prevented it from saying whether or not it was investigating the 
practice 
but dr ronald m davis director of the office on smoking and 
health of the us centers for disease control said i think 
its regrettable at best and scandalous at worst that this is 
happening 
its a strong indication that the cigarette industry is 
interested in luring children to begin to smoke 
smoking kills 390000 americans each year and 90 percent of 
smokers take up the habit as teenagers davis said 
steven weiss manager of media relations for philip morris usa 
in new york said the company only recently found out about the use 
of its products 
sega has not asked permission to use our logo and moreover 
we would not grant such permission to use any of our cigarette 
logos in any video game especially those played by minors he 
said all our cigarette advertising and promotions are directed 
at informed adult smokers only 
weiss said philip morris wrote to sega on nov 20 asking it to 
stop using the marlboro logo and recall all games that include it 
the letter was sent seven days after rep thomas luken dohio 
told philip morris he was going to hold hearings on the video 
advertising 
according to the march 5 1983 issue of the medical journal of 
australia a game called pole position included the marlboro logo 
that year the journal said a philip morris official in australia 
had been told then about the use of the logo 
scott murdock director of sales promotion and merchandising for 
anheuser busch said the company had not authorized the use of its 
brand name or logo 
based on the information you have provided to us we will ask 
our legal department to investigate the matter he said

president mikhail s gorbachev faced 
protesters on his home soil for the first time last week and the 
whole nation watched 
at every stop on gorbachevs threeday tour of lithuania he 
encountered people shouting freedom and waving placards 
calling for independence for the small baltic republic lithuania 
was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 after a mere two 
decades as a sovereign state 
it was obvious even before gorbachev left moscow that he had no 
chance of achieving his assigned task persuading lithuanian 
communists to reverse their decision to break with the national 
soviet party and support independence for lithuania 
each night on national television news millions of soviets saw 
gorbachev confront the demonstrators sometimes with humor 
sometimes with arguments 
where once carefully selected crowds would have been on hand to 
cheer the soviet leader and any open dissenters would have hustled 
away by police gorbachev treated yelling protesters as if they 
were an ordinary part of political life 
perhaps from now on they will be 
it seemed unlikely that gorbachev who has demonstrated his 
extraordinary political acuity in redefining the postwar world 
would set himself up for failure in lithuania it appears now he 
intended to demonstrate that even secessionists if peaceful 
will be fought with reason and logic not tanks and troops 
his conduct sent a message to others of the soviet unions 
expanding numbers of separatists that the kremlin is more likely to 
accommodate political maneuvering toward independence like that in 
lithuania than the violence that erupted along the iranian border 
in azerbaijan 
gorbachevs new policies of tolerating opposition political 
parties and promising to put calls for secession to a vote both 
announced in vilnius last week are part of his strategy for 
holding the union together through democratic means 
even if the soviet empire does disintegrate his approach could 
provide an orderly peaceful alternative to a chaotic collapse of 
soviet power 
it was only nine months ago that soviet troops armed with 
shovels and gas waded into a singing dancing crowd of 10000 
proindependence demonstrators in tbilisi georgia killing 19 
people a soviet parliamentary commission has condemned the 
decision to use force against the peaceful protesters but citizens 
still worry openly that such force could be used again 
they also know that gorbachev has hardline opponents who are 
more likely than he to crack down on those bent on leaving the 
union 
in a meeting of the communist party central committee in 
december gorbachev condemned the use of force as a means of 
combating the political views of a large segment of society but 
other senior party officials are believed to favor stronger action 
to put down the secessionists 
in tiny lithuania with just 37 million of the soviet unions 
287 million people the twoyear fight for restoration of 
independence has been determinedly peaceful 
gorbachevs trip was no different hundreds of thousands of 
people packed the central square and all the surrounding streets of 
vilnius for a candlelit proindependence demonstration thursday 
night on gorbachevs first day in town the president steered clear 
of that rally but at every stop he met protesters carrying the 
yellow red and green flags of independent lithuania or chanting 
freedom 
despite their fervor the encounters were without exception 
civil 
at one stop gorbachev gazed at the posters calling for freedom 
and joked and you say you are not free 
local police linked arms in a human chain to keep the crowds 
from surging forward and overwhelming what lithuanian officials 
described as the first soviet communist party chief to visit the 
republic in its 50 years as part of the soviet union but the 
security was not unusually oppressive 
there were no signs of heavily armed guards or sharpshooters 
and there did not appear to be any particular concern that the 
lithuanians would break their determination to stay peaceful 
behind closed doors with lithuanian officials according to some 
of those present gorbachev kept hearing the same refrain 
independence 
on the streets where a decade ago billboards trumpeted hail 
to labor and praised the communist party in red neon downtown 
vilnius sported a new theme lithuania without sovereignty is 
lithuania without a future 
for gorbachev and for the rest of his highpowered entourage 
including politburo members vadim medvedev and yuri maslyukov it 
was an introduction to dealing with domestic political opponents 
with a solid power base of their own 
for top soviet communists it is a new field on which they must 
compete for the hearts and minds of their countrymen

developments in the baltics and covered the gorbachev visit to

when demonstrators stormed leipzigs secret 
police headquarters last month it seemed the most despised 
instrument of communist state control was doomed 
a citizens group began sifting through the leipzig files to pin 
down names of secret police agents and informers somehow nobody 
noticed that nine communist party members had slipped in among the 
16 volunteer investigators 
everywhere prodemocracy forces turn these days east germanys 
communists are still in positions of power with free elections 
less than four months away they essentially control the government 
and dominate political life 
basically nothing has really changed said a leipzig state 
railways employee the communist party still has its people 
everywhere and theyre just not going to leave said the woman 
who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal 
in east germanys gray winter the national euphoria sparked by 
last falls peaceful uprising has faded into the harsh realization 
that 40 years of stalinist rule cannot be overcome quickly 
sensing a troubled future nearly 1800 citizens are migrating 
to west germany every day in a continuing drain on the flagging 
socialist economy 
opposition forces remain splintered lacking a charismatic 
figure like solidarity leader lech walesa in poland or vaclav 
havel czechoslovakias dissidentturnedpresident 
dravy kuntzsch a 20yearold machinist told a west german 
newspaper he expects a powerful constituency including party 
members secret police informers and people worried about their 
jobs to ensure a communist victory in the first free elections may 
6 
last week deep opposition mistrust erupted into a political 
crisis that forced communist premier hans modrow to scrap plans for 
creating a new secret police force before the election 
modrow rejected charges that his caretaker government is denying 
opposition groups a fair chance in the elections and extended a 
vague offer of posts in his government 
but rainer eppelmann spokesman for the democratic awakening 
opposition group is wary he complains that such offers are mere 
acts of mercy by the still firmly entrenched communist party 
the secret police issue is especially sensitive because past 
communist leaders relied on the internal security network to crush 
dissent 
modrow says he is dissolving and disarming the force but 
opposition activists worry that decades of tight bonds between the 
communists and their agents will persist 
a leader of one reform group said he fears a mobilization of 
loyal agents with weapons drawn from secret communistcontrolled 
caches allegedly spread throughout the country 
new forum founding member ralf henrich with an eye on recent 
events in romania does not rule out such a big strike 
i hope it will not come but we are worried he told west 
germanys bild am sonntag newspaper the communist party wants to 
make people submissive again 
despite a rush of resignations the party still counts 14 
million members in a country of 163 million people 
the communists still run television radio and virtually all 
printing plants they control the nations bureaucracy factories 
postal and telephone service 
warning lights flashed when the communists launched into the 
election year with a media campaign against an alleged neonazi 
threat reform groups and west german politicians condemned the 
move as a ploy to muzzle the opposition 
the communists justified all acts of violence since 1945 with 
antifascism wrote west german television journalist fritz 
schenk who fled east germany in the 1950s 
over the weekend the government took a new tack to woo west 
german capital as well as voters dissatisfied with drabness 
economics minister christa luft a communist called for radical 
moves toward a market economy 
undoubtedly once unthinkable criticism is now possible in east 
germany after major changes in one of the soviet blocs most 
repressive societies 
massive demonstrations starting last october forced the ouster 
of hardline leader erich honecker and the opening of east 
germanys western borders 
in keeping with eastern european trends the communists scrapped 
their constitutional monopoly on power promised to move toward 
democratic socialism and published revelations of corruption 
among the old elite 
but for many contrition isnt enough and talk is cheap 
in the new years first demonstration at leipzig the birthplace 
of last falls unrest anger against the continuing communist hold 
on power was rising among the more than 100000 protesters 
east german artist wolfgang mattheuer says it is not relatively 
minor faults like the old leaderships privileged lifestyle a 
few scoundrels hunting lodges sofas and swimming pools that 
make people take to the streets 
the real reason is that east germans dont want another 
communist experiment the 62yearold party member commented

resumption of relations by syria and 
egypt takes the arabs a step closer to the unity that has eluded 
them for decades and reflects changes in the thinking of their 
leaders 
the rapprochement that ended a 12year rift between two giants 
of the arab world comes amid other signs of growing cohesion among 
moslem states 
it also underlines the more pragmatic approach arab leaders are 
now taking turning away from the mirage of instant unification 
that beguiled them for so many years 
their view of the world and their place in it has shifted over 
the years from the emotional concept of the arab nation to the 
harsh realities of coexistence with other power blocs and that 
israel is there to stay 
the arab leagues push for an international middle east peace 
conference under un auspices underlines the understanding that 
israel is a reality and cannot be crushed the palestine liberation 
organizations recognition of israels right to exist exemplifies 
that 
the syriaegypt reconciliation is the latest step toward ending 
decades of division in the arab world 
syria and jordan made up in 1985 after years of dispute last 
year syria restored relations broken off in 1986 with morocco 
but hafez assads syria remains a bitter enemy of iraq 
egypt came in from the cold in 1987 after a decade of ostracism 
over its 1979 peace treaty with israel marxist south yemen and 
conservative north yemen are striving toward unity after a 20year 
split 
in crisistorn lebanon which arab rivals have long used as a 
proxy battleground the 22member arab league brokered a peace 
treaty in october aimed at ending the 14yearold civil war 
the treaty has stalled because of christian leader gen michel 
aouns rejection of it 
last year two regional alliances the fournation arab 
cooperation council and the fivestate arab mahgreb union were 
formed and grouped the nine countries in economic and defense blocs 
founded on the common interests of their members rather than 
outright political unity 
they followed the sixmember gulf cooperation council formed in 
1981 
but analysts say these groups still have a long way to go before 
they can become effective the arab world faces increasing economic 
integration of europe its biggest trading bloc and the 
uncertainties posed by the partial crumbling of eastwest power 
blocs 
its wonderful that the leaders meet said kamel abu jaber 
president of jordans world affairs council but does that mean 
this is real unity i dont think so 
president hosni mubarak of egypt noted earlier this month in 
this region we are concerned primarily with increasing our ability 
to deal with the european entity that is moving fast toward unity 
this new giant that will not confine itself to the eec 
countries but will extend to east european countries sooner or 
later 
jaber said looking at it in the historical perspective the 
regionalization of the arab world the attempt to make smaller 
unity rather than one great arab unity is a reflection of a 
certain maturity among arab leaders 
the worlds 210 million arabs live in 21 countries across a 
swath of territory that stretches from the atlantic to the indian 
ocean 
they share a common language arabic and culture a history of 
conquest and a majority religion islam 
despite a common enemy israel and their quest for greater 
unity the modern history of the arabs has often been one of 
discord based in part on traditional tribal rivalries 
syria led the arab boycott of egypt after president anwar sadat 
visited jerusalem in 1977 it broke off relations with cairo that 
year and was followed by 16 other arab countries when two years 
later cairo signed the only peace treaty between an arab country 
and israel 
president assad still adamantly opposes the treaty while mubarak 
holds firmly to the agreement it is a sign of the changing times 
that this did not prevent them from resuming diplomatic relations 
last month 
western diplomats in damascus said the move was prompted largely 
by assads desire to escape from increasing isolation in the region 
following the arab summit decision to readmit egypt to the arab 
league 
that left only maverick libyan leader col moammar gadhafi 
holding out against cairo although he too has been moving slowly 
toward resuming diplomatic relations 
gadhafi is the last representative in the arab world of the 
unity fever that swept the region from the 1950s through the 1970s 
but the history of mergers between arab countries has been a 
warning to the current generation of leaders who remember the 
fiasco of egypts threeyear merger with syria that broke down in 
acrimony in 1961 with damascus accusing cairo of betrayal and of 
wrecking its economy 
the gulf cooperation council made up of saudi arabia kuwait 
the united arab emirates bahrain qatar and oman was set up in 
1981 after the iraniraq war broke out 
but jaber noted nothing has come out of it except meetings 
of the leaders consultations rather than coordination 
the arab magreb union formed in february 1989 groups libya 
algeria tunisia morocco and mauritania it aims to set up an 
economic common market on the european model 
egypt iraq jordan and north yemen set up the arab cooperation 
council in february 1989 but within months cairo and baghdad were 
embroiled in a dispute over alleged mistreatment of the hundreds of 
thousands of egyptian workers in iraq casting doubt on the 
groupings effectiveness in dealing with precisely the kind of 
issue it was set up to handle 
western diplomats in damascus say mubarak would clearly like to 
play matchmaker between assad and president saddam hussein of iraq 
to settle the remaining critical interarab rift 
but they note that the enmity is so deep that mubarak is 
unlikely to make much headway

governmentfunded shelters that help homeless 
youths often fail to continue aid after the maximum 15day stay 
leaving the young people without job training or other skills 
congressional investigators report 
this is a troubling picture said sen paul simon dill 
who asked the general accounting office to study a federal program 
that aids homeless youngsters and runaways 
shelters offer a safe haven for homeless youths and thats 
important simon said sunday but we need to offer more than a 
safe haven 
in 1977 congress expanded a shelter program for runaways by 
adding homeless youths but investigators said the problems 
experienced by the two groups often require different solutions 
gao the investigative arm of congress studied 198588 data 
submitted by federally funded shelters and interviewed shelter 
employees and experts on homeless youngsters investigators found 
21 percent or 9179 of the 44274 youths at the shelters were 
homeless 
61 percent of the homeless were without a place to live because 
of a problem with a parent or other adult 
26 percent were physically or sexually abused 
22 percent had a drug or alcohol problem but only 3 percent 
were treated 
the data do not show why the services rendered did not match 
youths problems the report said but resource constraints and 
the focus on shortterm care are possible reasons 
investigators said services planned for homeless youths after 
they complete the maximum 15day stay at a shelter may not be 
sufficient and 46 percent of the youths got nothing 
while homeless youth are at risk of leaving school and 
onethird get educational services while at the shelter less than 
10 percent have educational aftercare services planned the 
report said employment and job training for these youth are 
almost nonexistent 
gao said most homeless youths are male and 16 years or older 
after staying in a shelter their next destination may offer 
little stability the report said adding that 14 percent planned 
to live with a friend or on a street and another 6 percent planned 
to go to a new shelter 
simons legislation approved in 1988 and financed by congress 
last year established a 10 million independent living program for 
older homeless teens under the plan housing is offered in group 
settings and older teens stay until they can live on their own 
from a few months to a year 
they dont choose to leave home as runaways do simon said 
this is the last chance to reach them before they become adults

the brief failure of a guidance 
system component sounded an alarm that wakened columbias 
astronauts sunday night but a computer shifted to a backup unit 
and the crew was told to go back to bed 
mission control reported the problem was a transient electrical 
signal in an accelerometer that is part of an intertial measurment 
unit 
when the alarm sounded in the cabin commander dan brandenstein 
radioed the control center and asked if there were anything he 
could do 
controllers told him the spaceship computer had shifted to a 
second imu and everything was ok 
there are three such devices aboard only one is needed for a 
safe flight 
when the astronauts were wakened at the regular time later they 
were told the problem had gone away that the original unit was 
being put back on line 
good morning for your second wakeup of the morning mission 
control said 
the astronauts on sunday were passed the halfway point of their 
10day space journey 
after releasing one satellite and rescuing another last week 
the five astronauts turned their attention to secondary goals 
several scientific and medical tests 
welcome on board columbia on a sunday afternoon 
brandenstein said while shuttle cameras beamed down sweeping views 
of the earth our sunday i think was much like everyone elses 
sunday around the country it was probably one of our easier days 
during the mission 
were at the midpoint and the high visibility and exciting 
activities of syncom deploy and rendezvous are behind us but were 
still working on numerous objectives in the materials processing 
and the extended duration orbiter medical experiments 
syncom a navy communications satellite was released wednesday 
the long duration exposure facility a scientific laboratory that 
had been in orbit nearly six years was captured by the crew friday 
and is now in the shuttles cargo bay 
brandenstein said crew members also filmed parts of the earth 
with the powerful imax camera including the galapagos islands in 
the pacific the imax footage is to be used in a film called the 
blue planet 
assessing the first half of the trip flight director al 
pennington said it has been a flawless flight we have a 
beautifully running orbiter 
the 10day flight is the secondlongest in 33 shuttle missions 
and is intended as a stepping stone toward longer shuttle flights 
and monthslong stints aboard space station freedom columbia is 
scheduled to land friday at 259 am pst at edwards air force 
base calif 
some of the television shots beamed to earth showed mission 
specialist bonnie dunbar checking on an experiment that suffered a 
mishap friday but was repaired sunday 
the experiment involves melting and resolidifying a metal 
indium which melts at a relatively low temperature it was shut 
down while scientists on the ground studied videotape of a crack 
that had developed in a glass container or ampul within the 
experiment apparatus experts were concerned that the cracked glass 
could shatter sending shards floating in the crew cabin 
on sunday dunbar wearing a mask and gloves removed the 
cracked container and carefully vacuumed the machine pennington 
said no glass fragments were discovered during the cleanup and 
the broken ampul was replaced with a new one 
the camera also showed pilot jim wetherbee running on a 
treadmill at about the same time his 70yearold mother althea 
was competing in the houstontenneco marathon 
mrs wetherbee an avid runner who participates in about two 
marathons a year said she would keep glancing to the heavens to 
get inspiration to run the 262mile marathon she and her husband 
dana live in huntington station ny but they came to houston to

a philadelphia photographer is a step closer 
to becoming the first person in 11 years to win federal permission 
to dive to the wreck of the civil war ship monitor 
but one hurdle remains before gary gentile can realize his 
obsession 
gentile 43 has filed 11 permit applications and written more 
than 50 letters to the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration in his quest to photograph the monitor which he 
calls americas most famous shipwreck 
as part of his bid gentile has enlisted the aid of fellow scuba 
enthusiasts reporters and rep robert borski dpa 
noaa part of the commerce department is responsible for 
safeguarding the wreckage 16 miles off cape hatteras nc the 
monitor sank in a gale after a celebrated battle with the 
confederate ship merrimack the merrimack was destroyed by its crew 
to prevent it from being captured by union forces 
gentile and his attorney fellow diver peter hess of wilmington 
del won a victory on jan 4 when noaa reversed its earlier 
decision denying permission to dive to the 128yearold wreck 
because of safety concerns hess hopes to accompany gentile on the 
expedition 
the monitor is buried in about 220 feet of water and noaa had 
previously said the depth poses a serious and unreasonable risk 
but noaas new ruling said agency officials had been too 
stringent in applying guidelines regarding potentially risky dives 
however the agency stopped short of issuing the permit that 
gentile and hess have sought for five years 
instead the opinion of john j carey of noaas national ocean 
service outlined a series of factors he said must be considered 
before a permit is issued the factors included gentiles 
responsibility to the public and the appropriateness of his 
research methods 
any information gentile uncovers must be made available to the 
public carey said in addition he said gentile and his divers 
must agree not to hold the government responsible for injuries 
since the dive is deeper than normally permitted 
hess said in an interview friday he was worried because no 
schedule was set for issuing the permit in addition he said he 
fears additional conditions for the dive could be imposed later 
he said he wrote noaa a letter last week requesting a time 
frame for agency action 
noaa allowed french explorer jacques cousteaus party to dive to 
the monitor in 1979 but the weather and visibility was poor and 
virtually no usable pictures resulted no one has been permitted to 
dive to the site since although noaa got some pictures from a 
remote device in 1987 
gentile has said he hopes to make the expedition in june or july 
and to publish a book about it

low and middleincome blacks and hispanics 
have seen a major regression in college attendance since the 
mid1970s according to the american council on education 
based on census bureau figures the college participation rate 
for dependent lowincome black high school graduates between 18 and 
24 years old dropped from 398 percent in 1976 to 303 percent in 
1988 said the eighth annual status report on minorities in higher 
education 
for hispanics the rate fell from 504 percent to 353 percent 
over the same period indicating an educational failure rate of 
intolerable magnitude said the report released today by the 
councils office of minority concerns 
since the mid1970s the college participation of african 
americans and hispanics has been a picture not of progress but of 
major regression the report said 
lowincome white high school graduates made a slight gain in 
college participation rising from 368 percent to 388 percent 
the report said 
deborah carter who compiled the study for the washingtonbased 
education group along with reginald wilson said the focus was on 
the high school completion and college participation patterns of 
lowincome and middleincome black and hispanic youth living at 
home with their families 
the study said the bulk of the black and hispanic youths 51 
percent and 45 percent respectively were from families with 
incomes under 18581 twentyfive percent of the blacks and 33 
percent of the hispanics had family incomes between 18582 and 
33510 and 16 percent of the blacks and 17 percent of the 
hispanics had family incomes of between 33511 to 52119 the 
report said 
eight percent of the black youth and 5 percent of hispanic youth 
were from families with incomes of 52120 and above 
middleincome blacks and hispanics showed the most severe 
declines in college participation during the late 1970s and early 
1980s said the report by 1988 the college participation rate of 
middleincome blacks had fallen to 362 percent from 527 percent 
in 1976 with black males hit most severely 
corresponding rates for hispanics were 464 percent in 1988 
compared with 534 percent in 1976 
the report showed that as a group the number of degrees earned 
by minorities including blacks hispanics asian americans and 
american indians increased from 1976 to 1987 with jumps of 309 
percent in bachelors degrees and 634 percent for 
firstprofessional degrees 
but blacks sustained the greatest losses among all racial and 
ethnic groups from 1976 to 1987 the number of blacks earning 
bachelors degrees fell 43 percent from 59122 degrees to 56554 
degrees for black males the drop was 122 percent from 25634 to 
22498 bachelors degrees 
blacks earned 64 percent of the 918388 bachelors degrees 
awarded in 1976 but only 57 percent of the 991264 bachelors 
degrees in 1987 hispanics earned 2 percent of the degrees in 1976 
and 27 percent in 1987 
the report also said that from 1976 to 1988 high school 
completion rates increased for blacks and hispanics ages 18 to 24 
in 1988 43 percent of lowincome hispanic males and 53 percent of 
lowincome black males completed high school compared with 60 
percent of lowincome hispanic females and 69 percent of lowincome 
black females 
for all races and incomes 805 percent graduated high school in 
1976 compared with 812 percent in 1988 college enrollment for 
all high school grads increased from 534 percent in 1976 to 575 
percent in 1988 
given the low high school completion rate of lowincome 
african american and hispanic youth and given that less than 
onethird of lowincome african american and hispanic high school 
graduates enroll in college one realizes that as a nation we have 
not come close to addressing the postsecondary educational needs 
of lowincome minority youth the report said

hispanics were more likely than nonhispanics 
to be victims of violent crimes particularly robbery during the 
seven years ending in 1986 the justice department reports 
eleven of every 1000 hispanics age 12 or older were robbed 
between 1979 and 1986 compared to a rate of six robberies per 
1000 nonhispanics the study said sunday 
it said hispanics were more likely to be victims of violent 
crime during the period though the victimization rate for this 
category dropped from 44 violent crimes per 1000 hispanics in 1979 
to 29 in 1986 
the violent crime rate for nonhispanic victims was generally 
lower during the sevenyear period than for hispanics according to 
the study by the bureau of justice statistics 
it dropped from 38 per 1000 people in 1979 to 31 in 1986 the 
only year of the period when the violent crime rate among 
nonhispanics was higher than hispanics 
the study said that hispanics were more likely to be crime 
victims than other americans because as a group they tended to be 
younger poorer and more concentrated in central cities these 
demographic characteristics are associated with high crime it said 
even controlling for these factors the study said the robbery 
rate for hispanics was still higher than for nonhispanics 
hispanic and nonhispanic people who share the same 
demographic traits had generally comparable crime victim rates 
except for robbery and to a lesser degree aggravated assault 
joseph besette the bureaus director said in a statement 
hispanics were also more likely to be victims of crimes such as 
burglary car thefts and household larcenies the study said 
during the sevenyear period the average annual rate of such 
household crimes was 266 per 1000 hispanic homes compared to a 
rate of 205 for nonhispanic homes the study said 
the statistics were gathered from the national crime survey 
which canvasses 100000 americans age 12 or older those surveyed 
are interviewed twice a year in 50000 households

robert t morris has been described as a 
genius yet the jury judging his computer hacking trial is 
comprised of software illiterates and deliberately so 
morris 25 a suspended cornell university graduate student is 
charged with computer tampering for allegedly unleashing a wildly 
replicating worm program that temporarily immobilized a us 
computer network in november 1988 
lawyers say its not uncommon to fill a jury with people 
unfamiliar with a subject that is central to a trial but it can be 
a gamble 
its a trial strategy one has to decide says theodore 
hagelin a computer law professor and director of the law 
technology and management program at syracuse university 
but you run a real risk of losing them in the flood of 
information and definitions they must listen to 
us justice department lawyers ellen meltzer and mark rasch and 
defense attorney thomas guidoboni interviewed 23 prospective jurors 
to hear the case and both sides focused on computer literacy 
so did us district judge howard munson who asked potential 
jurors if they owned a computer or knew how to use them 
no i dont know a thing about them said a woman who then 
was selected 
the only three prospective jurors who said they owned a personal 
computer were rejected although two jurors who worked with 
computers at their jobs an airline reservation clerk and 
insurance claims processor were accepted twelve jurors and one 
alternate were seated 
during much of the first three days of testimony last week 
jurors listened as witnesses painstakingly tried to simplify the 
hightechnology world of computers explaining alien terms like 
email finger demons and decompilation or the 
differences among source codes assembly codes and binary codes 
even the court reporter has struggled to keep up with the jargon 
rasch and guidoboni declined to talk about the jury selection 
but hagelin said there is sound reason behind the strategy 
by choosing jurors that are not particularly sophisticated 
about technology you create a juror pool with an open mind or at 
least you hope so he said 
harold l burstyn a lawyer specializing in computer law said 
one computer expert could contaminate the jury 
youd have to be deathly afraid that one individual claiming 
to be an expert or being an expert would get all the other jurors 
to follow him because of his knowledge rather than because of 
their belief in guilt or innocence burstyn said 
jurors lacking great knowledge of computers would be better able 
to follow the instructions of law given by the judge burstyn said 
still prosecutors must educate jurors sufficiently before 
ending their case hagelin said 
on one level you have to get them to understand what 
happened he said but on a second level you have to put it a 
way that wont swamp them a way that will stay in their minds when 
they go to their room to deliberate the real trick is to find the 
balance they can only follow so far 
in the end the case may be decided by which attorney can 
provide the most succinct and powerful metaphor to translate the 
case to its most simplest terms burstyn and hagelin agreed 
morris of arnold md is the first person charged under a 
section of the 1986 computer fraud and abuse act dealing with 
federal computer networks he faces up to five years in prison and 
a 250000 fine if convicted 
prosecutors allege he designed and unleashed a worm program 
that immobolized an estimated 6000 computers linked to the 
internet research computer network including those at national 
aeronautics and space administration and air force facilities and 
several universities 
the defense has said morris created the worm as a computer 
security experiment but that he made a programming mistake that 
let the worm go berserk he has said morris did not intend to cause 
any damage 
testimony continues tuesday with government witnesses scheduled 
to take the stand

families whose children died or showed 
injuries after being vaccinated for whooping cough and other 
diseases can seek restitution without litigation under a claims 
system that already has awarded victims 22 million federal 
officials say 
the system administered by the us claims court provides 
families an alternative to timeconsuming sometimes fruitless 
lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies and doctors 
the compensation program is designed to be fast flexible and 
efficient while protecting the familys right to a fair and 
impartial decision said gary golkiewicz who oversees a staff of 
specially appointed claims court lawyers handling vaccine cases 
created by the national childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 
the program also covers injuries linked to vaccines for measles 
mumps rubella and polio the system is financed by congressional 
appropriations and an excise tax on the sale of vaccines 
the claims court awarded 1 million to joshua schroeder who 
experienced seizures after being given two shots of a childhood 
vaccine for diphtheria tetanus and pertussis whooping cough 
joshua now 12 is developmentally retarded 
i think this compensation system is better than trying to 
fight the doctors or trying to fight the drug manufacturers said 
brenda meland joshuas mother the money doesnt change him but 
it sure helps us help him 
mrs melands son suffered convulsions within hours of receiving 
dpt shots she suspected the vaccine as the cause but decided not 
to file a lawsuit 
insurance covered most of joshuas medical costs and mrs 
meland said she didnt want to get in front of lawyers for drug 
companies and doctors who would be questioning us making us feel 
like it was our fault as they searched for other possible causes 
for the boys problems 
some 57000 us children receive dpt vaccines each week most 
children receive four dpt shots before age 2 vaccination against 
dpt is required by state laws for admission to school 
some children experience pain swelling and high fever after 
being given the injections severe reactions include seizures 
doctors generally attribute the reaction to the pertussis portion 
of the vaccine although debate rages in the scientific community 
on the question of whether it causes permanent injury 
leaders of the american academy of pediatrics are recommending 
that the academy adopt a policy statement saying there is no proof 
that dpt causes severe neurologic disease or death 
under the compensation system families dont face the legal 
burden of proving to a jury that the vaccine caused the injury or 
death and that a pharmaceutical company or doctor was negligent 
instead compensation goes to children who develop specific 
symptoms within a certain period after being immunized and suffer 
an injury that lasts at least six months the payment is made as 
long as the government doesnt prove the injury was due to some 
other cause 
claims must be processed within a year of being filed in the 
systems 14 months of operation 224 million has been awarded for 
43 deaths and injuries occurring before oct 1 1988 another 18 
claims have been rejected or were voluntarily withdrawn when it 
became clear the families would not receive an award 
parents groups vaccine manufacturers and physicians lobbied to 
get the program through congress 
i think its still too early to say whether this system will 
handle all claims and relieve all the problems providers and

the cocaineproducing countries of 
bolivia colombia and peru have agreed to launch through 
coordinated use of their armed forces an unstoppable assault on 
drug traffickers 
the united states also signed the agreement sunday for the 
increased antidrug efforts but south american delegates said the 
accord leaves out any language that might open the door to direct 
us intervention in the fight 
the text of the plan will be kept secret until president bush 
and at least two of the south american presidents sign it at a drug 
summit feb 15 in colombia officials said 
we are very satisfied said michael skol a deputy assistant 
secretary of state who led the us delegation he declined to 
elaborate 
the agreement reached after a fiveday preparatory meeting 
represents an integral commitment by the four countries which 
have proposed carrrying out a frontal and unstoppable assault on 
narcotics trafficking said bolivias foreign minister carlos 
iturralde 
iturralde said the accord recognizes the need for more us 
economic aid to the south american countries which in turn 
committed themselves to a fullfledged military campaign against 
the multibilliondollar cocaine industry 
until recently we perhaps havent wanted to accept the 
reality of narcotics trafficking he said before we limited 
ourself to police action 
under the agreement the south american countries are committed 
to using all the means they have available including the armed 
forces in the war on trafficking he said 
his speech which covered the agreement in general terms 
concluded the meeting at 430 am sunday one day later than 
planned 
a oneparagraph statement from the delegations said they 
achieved the goals set for them and expected a successful 
summit which would adopt the joint integral and coordinated 
strategy against illegal drugs and their economic and social 
effects 
delegates said the delay was prompted by arguments over how us 
asssistance should be directed and what conditions would be 
attached to it 
the united states insists that the flow of aid money depends on 
a countrys dedication and performance in the antidrug effort 
bush and presidents virgilio barco of colombia and jaime paz 
zamora of bolivia are to sign the agreement at the summit in 
cartagena colombia president alan garcia of peru has said he will 
attend only if us troops are withdrawn from panama by then but 
his government will send a representative in any case 
some delegates speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states agreed to a request to provide aid in cases where the 
antidrug campaign hurt a south american countrys economy 
the united states has pressed producer countries to use their 
military against traffickers saying police alone cannot handle the 
powerful drug cartels 
but some south american countries fear it would expose their 
poorly paid armed forces to drug dealers bribes and corruption in 
1980 bolivian military leaders linked to traffickers seized power 
in a coup and ruled for a year 
several south american delegates said the issue of patrolling 
international waters or air space was left out of the document a 
us plan to put an aircraft carrier group off colombias coast to 
monitor smuggling was delayed last week when the colombians 
objected 
the colombian delegation was emphatic in making sure the 
agreement contained nothing that might allow direct us military 
action in the region conference sources said 
the conference was held at a hotel in santa cruz bolivias 
second biggest city and a center for shipping raw cocaine to 
colombian laboratories for processing 
most of the worlds coca leaf the raw material for cocaine is 
grown in peru and bolivia colombia is the principal center for 
refining and smuggling the drug to the united states and other user 
countries

hola they venture to passing women 
twentysix days after 26000 us troops toppled gen manuel 
antonio noriega panama city is wobbling toward normality 
in the first hours of the dec 20 invasion seismologists say 
the earth shook from 417 major explosions 
most of the blasts appear to have rattled the poor neighborhood 
of el chorrillo where noriegas military heaquarters crumbled 
under the weight of us firepower 
nearby carcasses of cars some overturned some on their sides 
are rusting in the hot sun 
the small apartments of el chorillo the little stream are 
gutted from the fires and gunfire and mortars that echoed through 
this city for a couple days while noriega loyalists fought us 
forces 
the battles drove thousands from their homes to safe havens in 
churches and stadiums 
but last week there was dancing and drinking on the narrow 
sidewalks and panamanians waved from their balconies when 
authorities knocked down the walls of the generals old 
headquarters 
men with atlas beers in their hands stumbled through the 
littered room that was noriegas office looking for souvenirs and 
pornography in the piles of debris the us military left behind as 
unimportant 
viva bush one man shouts 
outside plumes of dust float up to the grey sky in thick puffs 
filling the air with the acrid smell of leftover tear gas a little 
boy quietly throws a pailful of the family garbage into the ruins 
broken glass empty cartons and shreds of paper are piled high 
remnants of the rampant looting that broke out and went unstopped 
for four days emptying businesses of 1 billion of goods and 
leaving 30000 without jobs 
television commercials urge viewers to return the stolen 
goods 
but no one seems to 
on that sunny afternoon the new president guillermo endara 
wore a blue suit puckered his lips and grabbed a sledgehammer 
over the ashes of the military we will build a new panama 
said the new civilian leader thursday after smashing a wall of the 
imposing building where noriega commanded his 16000 forces 
scribbled in black ink on white walls the message yanqui go 
home is dated january 1989 because only a year ago noriega 
seemed a winner 
next to it a 1990 thought free at last 
honking their horns caravans of cars inch through the capital 
past stop lights damaged in the fighting members of the new public 
security force wearing fatiques and mirrored sunglasses direct 
traffic they wear no guns 
its all a headache for carlos busby who says his tour business 
has been hurting since 1987 when noriega first started acting 
bellicose and scared away the visitors 
nobody really likes an intervention he says but he 
adds with a sign there was no choice 
a few yards from the vatican embassy where noriega holed up for 
10 days before giving up to us troops a rag doll effigy hangs by 
a rope next to a movie poster advertising the new james bond film 
license to kill 
on calle 78a in the golf heights suburb us soldiers sit in a 
shaded booth inside the gates of noriegas white stucco house a 
discreet and unimposing residence with the name noriega written 
on the outside in blue spanish tile 
the house is full remarks one soldier lots of things in 
there i cant afford 
although some have been withdrawn us soldiers are still 
visible everywhere they ring the foreign embassies where noriegas 
family and friends have sought asylum to ease the tedium 
panamanians feed the troops and bring them refreshments 
my first impression is that were really very well liked 
muses new us ambassador deane hinton 
at the residence of the cuban ambassador a few blocks from 
noriegas house noriegas wife felicidad and three daughters are 
still hiding as are uncounted others 
the us troops wont let anyone in or out of the neighborhood 
without proof of residence 
at first people were pretty mad at us said one soldier 
now theyre used to us they say hi bye see you later 
for at least the few months panamanians must live with the 
confusion 
there were no winners there were no losers said vice

rep patricia schroeder says her bill to allow 
female us military personnel into combat probably wont get far 
in congress with most members up for reelection next november 
they want to duck waffle tap dance and everything else 
schroeder dcolo said of her colleagues sunday on cbstvs 
face the nation show i think theyre terrified to take the 
next step because of the emotionalism and irrationality surrounding 
the issue 
most members of congress fear that if they voted to allow women 
in combat opponents would campaign against them as the 
congressman who voted to put your daughter in combat boots she 
said 
schroeder a member of the house armed services committee 
announced after the us invasion of panama last month she would 
introduce the bill when congress reconvenes jan 23 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the same committee in the 
senate has expressed opposition to changing the current law which 
prohibits the navy and air force from assigning women to combat 
ships or planes 
while the law does not explicitly include the army assistant 
secretary of defense christopher jehn said on the same program 
sunday that the army takes its cue from the statute that 
congress doesnt want women in combat

sergio sleeps with prostitutes and other 
men picks up the aids virus and passes it to his wife and infant 
child before dying 
victor is married and monogamous marco is young and 
impressionable and willing to try anything once 
the men arent real they are characters in a 15part 
spanishlanguage drama produced by public radio station kdna and 
being sent to spanish radio stations across the country 
called tres hombres sin fronteras or three men without 
borders the serial uses the story of three farmworkers who 
journey from a mexican village to the united states to warn 
hispanics about aids 
the series of fiveminute programs structured like a soap 
opera are intended to educate a population considered at high risk 
of getting the deadly disease 
the 148000 series was written in seattle and recorded in los 
angeles with technical production at this tiny radio station in an 
impoverished farm town of fewer than 2000 people 
the drama premiered last month on kdna and is running through 
the end of january on 15 spanishlanguage stations along the border 
from san diego calif to el paso texas said rosa ramon 
promotions director for kdna the drama runs for nine weeks the 
stations reach 21 states and some states of mexico 
farmworkers are considered at high risk for aids because of 
unsafe sexual contacts with prostitutes who may be intravenous 
drug abusers as well as other men said dr peter rabinowitz 
medical director of seattles novela health foundation and author 
of the script 
the story is not like a public service announcement rabinowitz 
said 
instead the nonprofit health education organization relied on 
studies of farmworkers actual sexual activities of in creating the 
characters and situations he said 
sergio the careless character has unprotected sex with 
prostitutes with other men his mistress and his wife he ends up 
with a long death scene in the final installment 
victor goes home from his farm work to a healthy wife and son 
marco weighs what he has observed in the behavior of his two 
friends and learns to protect himself 
the action and dialogue is graphic 
how much will my little time with you cost sergio asks one 
hooker 
not too much and youre going to like it a lot she replies 
but then she refuses to have sex with sergio because he wont 
use a condom she does have sex with marco who agrees to use one 
dont miss the next episode of three men without borders 
when sergio confronts another temptation the narrator says 
money for the production came from the california community 
foundation and other groups concerned about getting aids 
information to farmworkers 
in addition to the radio show the station produced several 
photonovellas booklets that use photographs of actors speaking 
with cartoonlike bubbles to tell the same story like the soap 
operas this format is being distributed throughout the border 
region ms ramon said 
the station which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary got 
involved in aids education after one yakima valley farmworker died 
of the disease garcia said about 17 percent of the areas 
residents are hispanic 
tres hombres is the stations first major production said 
manager ricardo garcia 
garcia said there have not been negative comments from listeners 
or other radio stations though he said there was some concern 
beforehand that the rough language would raise complaints an 
anthropologist from los angeles would conduct surveys along the 
border areas to determine how effective the radio program was 
spreading its message he said 
garcia said he translated rabinowitzs script into spanish and 
played a small part a paramedic in the radio drama ms ramon 
played another small part which she called the only virtuous 
woman

as sovietamerican tensions ease israels 
value as a strategic ally is being questioned and israeli officials 
are concerned this could lead to cuts in us military aid 
mark heller a senior analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee 
center for strategic studies says the soviets are likely to be 
less supportive of radical arab regimes and no longer viewed as a 
source of instability 
as the perceived soviet threat to the middle east declines so 
may the strategic value of israel in the eyes of american 
policymakers he said 
a major argument in providing israel with 18 billion a year in 
military aid has been its value as a strategic ally one that could 
preposition equipment supply the us sixth fleet and be counted 
on in a showdown 
there is no longer a common adversary said heller 
suggesting aid cuts could ultimately result 
more conservative analysts disagree they suggest israel may 
become an even greater asset if the united states is forced to 
close down bases in europe but wants to retain the ability to 
defend its interests against the whims of regimes like those of 
moammar gadhafi in libya and the islamic republic in iran 
expansionist powers in the region could threaten the free flow 
of oil and maritime trade routes these are constant american 
interests that will have to be defended even if no soviet threat is 
perceived said dore gold also of the jaffee center 
one sign of continuing us reliance came last week when us 
assistant secretary of defense paul wolfowitz expressed interest in 
having access to bases in israel according to sources who demanded 
anonymity 
defense minister yitzhak rabin who is in washington this week 
for talks with us officials on future military aid said one 
basic element had changed he said the superpowers no longer fear a 
middle east war would grow into a ussoviet confrontation as 
happened during the 1973 mideast war 
the soviet union the main military supplier to arab states 
threatened to introduce troops to bolster the arab side during the 
1973 war and us president richard nixon put us troops on 
nuclear alert 
in the past many books were written that tried to describe 
the middle east as the focal point from which the third world war 
would start this fear is over rabin said in a recent speech to 
a conference of visiting jewish journalists 
less worried about a confrontation and tied up with their own 
arms negotiations rabin said the soviets and americans are not as 
eager to tackle intractable regional conflicts like the 
arabisraeli dispute 
whenever one or the other of the superpowers will realize that 
the gap between the positions of the two sides is too wide they 
tell the two parties go to hell you want to quarrel you want to 
use violence do it until one of you or both of you will become 
tired 
rabin has reportedly set up a task force to study the impact of 
us defense cuts on israel 
an aide to finance minister shimon peres said in the past two 
years the real value of aid to israel has declined about 5 percent 
because of inflation 
speaking on condition of anonymity he suggested the thaw in 
cold war attitudes may be a factor in washingtons decision not to 
compensate israel for the loss 
i will not tell you i dont foresee any new thinking in the 
united states said the official who argued that israel could 
avoid any threatened aid cuts by moving quickly to get involved in 
the peace process 
sen pete wilson of california the senior republican on the 
senate armed forces committee told reporters during a visit here 
last week that israel remained a strategic ally and said aid should 
not be cut because of premature euphoria over changes in the 
soviet bloc 
i think there are a number of people who are eagerly 
anticipating a peace dividend that may not be as large as they 
think he said

wellwishers from as far as 260 miles 
away came to rosies diner to snap pictures and eat a final meal at 
the bluecollar greasy spoon immortalized in television paper towel 
commercials 
owner ralph corrado sporting a pink carnation perched on a 
counter stool as hundreds of people squeezed through the 
glassbricked entrance 
and amid clicking cameras and the booming sounds of a new york 
city radio station broadcasting live outside corrado noted one 
difference between television and real life 
youd go broke if you used paper towels to wipe up every 
spill corrado confided as he motioned to a dirty dish rag at 
the end of the long formica counter 
corrado 57 has been besieged by nostalgiaseekers since 
announcing plans to sell the classic 1940sera eatery he said hes 
been interviewed on radio shows from as far away as boise idaho 
the diner which corrado ran for 30 years achieved fame between 
1970 and 1975 when procter amp gamble featured it in four 
commercials for bounty paper towels 
in the ads actress nancy walker portrayed a waitress named 
rosie who wields the quicker picker upper against the counter 
spills of clumsy truck drivers 
corrado eventually renamed the diner formerly known as the 
farmland diner for rosie 
next week a moving crew will saw the diner in half and hoist it 
onto flatbed trucks so it can be transported to michigan 
the new owner jerry berta a ceramic sculptor who bought it for 
about 10000 says he plans to open the restaurant by summer in 
his hometown of rockford 
but a chapter of diner history ended for hundreds of area 
residents who still remember rosies 
truck driver joseph nordlander drove 260 miles from his farm in 
vanetten ny with his wife four children and a family friend 
to crowd into a booth for one last meal 
i used to come with my father who was also a trucker said 
nordlander 47 as he finished a plate of scrambled eggs 
the shame of it is that all these people didnt come here 
before said livingston accountant peter engel he said that he 
and his wife helen ate at rosies every sunday for the two years 
they lived in little ferry 
corrado said business has been off in recent years largely 
because of fastfood restaurants springing up 
for some saying goodbye the people who worked at rosies were 
like members of a family 
ive been coming here since i was 15 said frank bedacht 
40 of hackensack pointing out a sign across the street that once 
belonged to a popular drivein movie theater 
we used to go to the drivein and drink all night and come 
here to sober up 
oh god how many nights we used to sit back in the corner and 
moan til we could see 
but ralph took care of us hed feed us coffee til we were 
sober then let us go

the paroled child killer accused of 
murdering 11 women during the past two years was not even a suspect 
until the morning police spotted him sitting in a car near the 
frozen body of one of the victims 
arthur j shawcross fell into the hands of police the ay most 
serial killers are caught after months of grueling investigation 
and a dose of good luck 
serial killers often fall prey to their mistakes said jack 
levin a sociology professor at northeastern university who has 
written a book on multiple slayers 
not because of a multimilliondollar task force not because 
of the skillful investigative techniques of the police but 
because of a mistake he made that is typical 
david berkowitz new yorks son of sam killer was caught in 
1976 after he was ticketed for parking in front of a fire hydrant 
during the shooting of one of his six victims 
ted bundy who eluded police for four years following his escape 
from a colorado prison was arrested in 1978 after being pulled 
over by a florida policeman for erratic driving 
atlanta child killer wayne williams was caught when police heard 
him dumping the body of one of his victims off a bridge in 1981 
randy kraft convicted of 16 mutilationtorture murders in 
california was caught in 1983 when police stopped him for drunken 
driving and found a body in his car 
capt t michael nault of the king county wash police 
department agrees that investigative muscle alone usually doesnt 
solve such cases since 1982 king county authorities have hunted 
for the green river killer blamed for the deaths of up to 49 
young women 
we were told early on youre going to go on an intense 
laborious investigative process and youre going to need some good 
luck nault said 
weve been at it seven years and we havent had that fortunate 
circumstance yet 
investigators said shawcross arrest was an unusually quick 
resolution to a serialmurder case one of the most difficult to 
crack bodies dumped far from the killing site often not 
discovered until long after the slaying yield little physical 
evidence sheer volume of cases and lack of a motive also 
complicate efforts 
rochester police after concluding in november that they were 
dealing with a serial killer were prepared for a long 
investigation up to 60 officers were assigned to the case 
short of some miracle i would anticipate a very long 
tedious drawnout investigation chief gordon urlacher said in 
early december 
shawcross was one of hundreds of potential suspects identified 
by appearance but not by name through interviews and surveillance 
of an area frequented by prostitutes and their customers 
sgt roland marchetti a police spokesman said investigators 
had received routine information about shawcross background when 
he was paroled to the area in 1987 marchetti declined to comment 
about how that information was reviewed in an effort to find the 
serial killer in all there are records of 86 paroled killers in 
the rochester area 
edward elwin executive director of the state parole division 
said shawcross would not have been a likely suspect in the killings 
because people convicted in sexrelated killings of children 
generally do not also attack adult women shawcross served 15 years 
in prison after confessing to killing an 8yearold girl and a 
10yearold boy 
until state troopers conducting a helicopter search spotted 
shawcross in a county park on jan 3 the case seemed far from 
being solved 
we were just on a search just going over an area that we had 
covered previously said sgt ken r hundt one of the two 
pilots as far as im concerned it was just a matter of luck 
but without a laborious investigations police would not have 
had the evidence to make a case against shawcross said jim martin 
of the district attorneys office in new bedford mass where nine 
women were found slain in 1988 and 1989 those slayings are not 
solved 
and it wasnt just luck that allowed rochester officials to 
stumble upon shawcross that wintry morning martin said 
they knew where to look he said they were in the right 
place at the right time but they had reason to be there

the police dispatcher who became a hero for his 
10minute conversation with a frantic wounded charles stuart says 
the tragic turn of events indicating stuart orchestrated the scheme 
leaves him saddened and empty 
but if charles stuart called him today gary mclaughlin said he 
would coax and plead and try to soothe him through the ordeal again 
the tragic twisted bizarre end leaves you with that little 
bit of emptiness how another human being or beings however it 
turns out could do that to a person said mclaughlin 35 
but noting his job as the dispatcher was to get medical 
attention to people in need he said despite the tragic end i 
would say the mission was a success 
charles stuart used his cellular car phone to contact police 
after he and his pregnant wife carol 30 were shot oct 23 
carol stuart who had just left a childbirth class with her 
husband died of a bullet wound to the head her son christopher 
who was delivered by caesarean section died 17 days later 
authorities now say stuart who had blamed the shootings on a 
black mugger probably shot his wife and himself and at very least 
planned the shootings stuart killed himself jan 4 as the scheme 
was coming to light 
during the riveting 10minute conversation parts of which were 
later broadcast on national television a seriously wounded stuart 
moaned and seemed on the verge of passing out periodically as 
police sought to find out where his car was 
bear with me chuck im going to get someone to you 
mclaughlin told him hang in with me now just calm down just 
stay with me im going to get help to you help is going to be on 
the way 
you cant blank out on me i need you man chuck chuck 
boston officers who got on the line with mclaughlin and stuart 
managed to locate the stuarts car by having police cars in the 
neighborhood turn on their sirens at different times listening 
through the phone to see which ones sounded closest 
at the end of the tape after police reached the car mclaughlin 
is heard saying telling stuart to give his phone to the officer 
adding i dont want to terminate until someone can hear me want 
me to terminate sarge the tape becomes a jumble of voices and 
stuart can be heard saying get my wife out 
mclaughlin an earnest sober man who uses phrases such as 
negative and stand by has been a state police dispatcher 
for 14 years he usually fields calls from local police not 
members of the public but 911 calls from mobile phones go 
automatically to state police rather than a local department 
mclaughlin said he had no inkling stuarts story wasnt genuine 
i never thought for a minute that there was anything 
suspicious about the call especially when the ems team got there 
and found the people shot he said 
stuart never contacted mclaughlin afterward but the dispatcher 
says thats not unsual hes never heard of a crime victim who did 
call back to thank a dispatcher 
the news that stuart himself was implicated in the crime did not 
make mclaughlin wish he had done differently 
if he called today nothing would change he said thats 
not to convolute it with i mean we dont have ice in our veins 
i dont think anyone in the nation is not deeply saddened by the 
bizarre and twisted end 
mclaughlin said the call and the ensuing publicity was as 
arduous as any he had ever handled 
something thats difficult for a lot of people to understand 
is that this is the job we do and thats it mclaughlin said 
although he acknowledged as a human being the shooting gives 
you a sour feeling 
i feel like ive become a part of a very bizarre thing

buyers at the 91st international housewares 
exposition had their choice of 3 million products including heated 
ice cream scoops peachcolored light bulbs and skunkodor remover 
any of the 13000 retailers who had trouble choosing was free to 
wander over to the booth displaying tearapart stress dolls 
designed as an emotional outlet for people angry enough to want to 
tear an enemy limb from limb 
those who could be happy making hash of mere vegetables were 
able to fall back on the old and familiar ktels vegomatic 
for instance which still slices dices and chops in much the way 
it did when it was introduced about 15 years ago before selling 
more than 12 million models 
the fourday show sponsored by the national housewares 
manufacturers association opened sunday and is offering 1900 
manufacturers a chance to show off for retailers from more than 60 
countries said spokeswoman kimberly rawn 
in four days they can accomplish what would normally take 
months of traveling to the buyers to see the merchandise to talk 
about pricing new packaging new commmercial ideas really set up 
their merchandising plan for the year she said 
visitors include representatives from chains such as k mart 
sears bloomingdales and macys furniture stores gourmet shops 
and supermarkets but not the general public she said 
even if the 1990s bring an economic slump as some analysts 
predict housewares manufacturers expect to keep making profits 
housewares generally is recessionresistant because you and i 
arent going to hold off on buying that new toaster if we need it 
well hold off on buying the car or the new home but were still 
going to replenish the items we need rawn said 
one item that might not fall into the need category but 
probably would be affordable regardless of the economy is the 
heated gourmet ice cream scoop manufactured under the name hot 
dip by robeson industries corp of mineola ny 
the batteryoperated plastic scoop has a heating element in one 
corner of the scooping edge to help it glide through ice cream 
without making the frozen dessert melt it retails for a suggested 
599 said marketing manager carol dori 
philips lighting co of somerset nj has come up with a 
bright idea in home ambience 60watt pastel bulbs peach blue 
ivory green pink and yellow to give just a hint of color 
said sales director fred kellogg 
for pet owners out international inc of dallas has an answer 
to many a malodorous problem including out skunk remover a 
shampoo especially made for the dog or cat who has an unfriendly 
encounter with a muskspraying nemesis 
americans who are merely up tight may enjoy the tearapart 
stress doll marketed by blue ridge the item co of skyland nc

by age 55 women are as likely as men to have 
high blood pressure and more than half of american women that age 
have elevated cholesterol levels the american heart association 
says 
in its annual statistical report the association said sunday 
that by age 65 women are more likely than men to have high blood 
pressure 
the most recent figures show that heart disease and strokes 
killed 976706 americans in 1987 almost as many as died from all 
other causes combined that amounts to one heartdisease death 
every 32 seconds 
cancer by comparison killed 477190 
the statistics were released sunday at the opening of the 
associations annual science writers forum where scientists 
report on recent heart disease research 
this years statistics focus on the risks of heart disease in 
women 
the tally shows that more than half of all women ages 55 to 74 
have blood cholesterol levels above 240 at which heart disease 
risk increases substantially 
only onethird of men in that age group have cholesterol levels 
over 240 the association said 
men remain more likely than women overall to have heart attacks 
but women have a much higher rate of strokes which occur when 
cholesterol plugs an artery supplying blood to the brain 
cigarette smoking seems to pose a greater risk for women than 
for men the figures show a 55yearold woman who smokes is in 
more danger of a heart attack than a 55yearold male smoker 
a 55yearold woman who smokes and has high blood pressure and 
elevated cholesterol has a onethird higher risk of heart attack 
than a 55yearold man with the same risk factors 
the association estimates that heart disease costs the united 
states 945 billion a year in medical expenses and lost 
productivity 
the good news is that heart disease continues its gradual 
decline in 1950 the death rate from heart disease was 226 for 
every 100000 people by 1986 it had fallen to 129 per 100000 
nevertheless an estimated 67 million americans one in every 
four have some potentially dangerous form of heart or 
bloodvessel disease 
heart attacks will strike about 15 million americans this year 
and some 500000 will suffer from strokes the association said

author laurence j peter whose peter 
principle held that bureaucratic problems often occur because 
employees routinely are promoted beyond their competence has died 
he was 70 
peter who suffered from heart trouble and a stroke died in his 
sleep at his palos verdes home his wife irene said sunday 
peter and raymond hull wrote the 1969 bestseller the peter 
principle why things always go wrong a satirical chronicle of 
incompetence based on peters experience with educational and other 
bureaucracies 
according to peter every employee in a hierarchy tends to rise 
to the level of his or her incompetence an employee is promoted 
from position to position as long as he can do his job to his 
superiors satisfaction 
eventually however the employee is promoted to a job he cannot 
do and there he remains a meddlesome obstructive incompetent 
peter a psychologist and professor of education found such 
people in business schools government churches and political 
parties 
the cream rises until it sours he wrote 
over time peter said every post tends to be occupied by 
someone too incompetent to carry out its duties the only people 
who accomplish any useful work are those who have not yet been 
promoted to their level of incompetence he said 
peter also described the hazards of ladderclimbing including 
ulcers alcoholism allergies and tabulatory gigantism or an 
obsession with getting a bigger desk than ones colleagues 
after hailing his principle as the key to an understanding of 
the whole structure of civilization peter said he only was 
kidding but corporations took him at his word and sent job offers 
his way he turned them down saying he didnt want to rise to the 
level of his own incompetence 
his book sold 8 million copies was translated into more than 30 
languages and is still available in paperback 
hull wrote in the books introduction 
dare you read it dare you face in one blinding revelation 
the reason why schools do not bestow wisdom why governments cannot 
maintain order why courts do not dispense justice why prosperity 
fails to produce happiness why your utopian plans never generate 
utopias 
if you read you can never regain your present state of 
blissful ignorance you will never again unthinkingly venerate your 
superiors or dominate your subordinates never the peter principle 
once heard cannot be forgotten 
peter followed the peter principle with eight other books 
including the peter prescription how to make things go right 
in 1972 and the peter plan a proposal for survival in 1975 
born sept 16 1919 in vancouver british columbia peter 
worked in the canadian school system and became a professor at the 
university of british columbia he left in 1966 for a post at the 
university of southern california 
in addition to his wife peter is survived by sons john and 
edward daughters alice and margaret and three grandchildren 
funeral arrangements were not immediately available

president daniel ortega said early 
today that he was concerned the main opposition bloc may withdraw 
from the election campaign and accused it of plotting to create a 
situation like panama 
he said he told un election monitor eliot richardson about his 
worry that the opposition might pull out of the campaign then call 
next months elections fraudulent setting the stage for eventual 
us military intervention 
richardson representative of un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar refused to confirm whether this had been a topic 
of his threehour meeting with ortega the session ended shortly 
after midnight 
this was the first weekend in the campaign that the national 
opposition union or uno the 14party bloc challenging the ruling 
leftist sandinista front did not have mass rallies general 
elections are set for feb 25 
in panamas may elections gen manuel antonio noriega annulled 
the results after his candidates were defeated by the opposition 
slate the us invaders who ousted noriega last month installed as 
panamas new president guillermo endara who had run as the 
oppositions standardbearer in may 
the sandinistas have claimed the united states might be planning 
an invasion of nicaragua a charge american officials have denied 
opposition presidential candidate violeta barrios de chamorro 
in the united states after receiving treatment in houston for a 
fractured knee from a fall at her home was not expected back until 
some time this week 
her running mate virgilio godoy had been out of the country 
all week and returned friday 
the meeting between ortega who is running for reelection and 
richardson was originally scheduled for today but was moved up to 
sunday night and started at 9 pm aides on both sides said there 
had been scheduling problems 
the main concern that i expressed has to do with the attitude 
of the north american government with the contra activity and also 
the risk being run should uno withdraw from the electoral 
process ortega told reporters after his meeting in a hotel room 
the united states has supported the contra rebels in their 
battle with the government in managua 
the uno people have expectations to create a situation like 
panama ortega said moreover i know that uno leaders have 
spoken with us congressmen who have visited nicaragua 
theyre not playing fair ortega said of the opposition 
because theyre working so as to create in nicaragua a situation 
similar to that of panama and drag the united states into it 
ortega said 
opposition leaders could not be reached immediately for comment 
they have repeatedly said they will take part in the elections 
but also accuse the sandinistas of using unfair tactics ranging 
from intimidation to monopolizing the news media 
last week the opposition accused the government of blocking 
about 2 million in direct aid for its campaign that the us 
congress approved in october but over the weekend mrs chamorros 
newspaper la prensa reported that a government minister had 
agreed to release the money 
richardson a former us attorney general was asked about 
ortegas claim the opposition might withdraw 
he said he did not want to address the question in his un 
capacity but as an observer of the american scene 
i cant imagine the us government exerting any such 
pressure richardson said

authorities have captured and sentenced to death a 
diplomat who began spying for the united states nearly 30 years 
ago passing classified information on topics ranging from chemical 
arms to politics pravda said 
the communist party daily did not identify the man or say 
whether he had been executed 
in its report sunday pravda said the man codenamed 
donald was one of the most important of about 30 western spies 
caught by the soviets in recent years it said he had confessed 
but did not say when he was arrested 
in todays editions the new york times quoted an unidentified 
us official in washington as confirming that an american agent 
from deep within the soviet bureaucracy had been arrested it 
said the american official expressed mild surprise that the soviets 
had made the capture public 
in washington a fbi press duty officer greg jones told the 
associated press he had no comment on the pravda story cia 
spokesman bill devine also refused to comment its our standard 
procedure that we neither confirm nor deny such allegations 
devine said 
the report was apparently intended at least in part to enhance 
the prestige of a kgb official whose name has been mentioned in 
connection with a corruption scandal 
it reserved a glamorous role for the kgb official col 
alexander s dukhanin who has been criticized by a legislative 
commission investigating charges of official corruption extending 
all the way to politburo member yegor k ligachev 
dukhanin had corruption charges dropped against a former 
moldavian communist party official who reportedly may have been the 
sole link between ligachev and uzbekistan party officials convicted 
of taking bribes 
ligachev 70 reportedly the conservative force on the 
politburo has denied any wrongdoing in the case 
pravda claimed that donald began spying for the americans in 
november 1961 when he was a highranking soviet representative at 
un headquarters in new york he supposedly met an fbi agent john 
f in the street after making his acquaintance at a party 
information changed hands and the man the us intelligence 
services codenamed donald was recruited pravda said it said 
the soviet diplomat with access to classified information on a 
broad range of topics supplied it regularly to the fbi and later 
to the cia 
donald gave the americans political and economic 
information data on chemical and bacteriological defenses and 
even information about diseases of rice corn and wheat pravda 
said 
pravda said the purported spys american contacts had used the 
new york times to pass him messages it quoted what it said was a 
personal ad in the newspaper on oct 20 1964 
moodydonald f please write as you promised 
everything is fine with uncle charles and sister clara they 
want you to write to them 
dont forget the addresses of dave doug and their wives 
are you planning to travel when where 
we hope that soon our family will be together again 
greetings and best wishes from brother edward k and john f 
kloster new jersey 
pravda said that when soviet investigators broke the codes the 
first line was a reminder about the conditions of making contact 
with his american contacts and the second line expressed their 
willingness to work through two unidentified contacts 
during his career donald worked for the cia in india the 
newspaper said where he was allegedly equipped by a us spy with 
sophisticated espionage devices that enabled him to send 
information from unlikely places for example a bus as it passed by 
the us embassy 
while in india donald was warned that the cia had leaked to 
the media a report that a soviet official at the united nations had 
been recruited as a spy by the americans in the 1960s pravda said 
the news put the man on his guard but he failed to notice he 
was under heavy surveillance and was caught redhanded in an 
unspecified act of espionage pravda said 
he confessed and was sentenced to death the newspaper said 
pravda said donald asked about why he spied answered i 
was so accustomed to walking on a sharp edge that i did not think 
of a different life for myself 
in its commentary on the case pravda says suggested that he 
acted out of damaging vanity 
and he was selfassured too he didnt believe that he would 
be caught it said

for actress viveca lindfors a random slashing 
on a greenwich village sidewalk has only made her more determined 
to fight back in her own way 
its scary because you dont know who the enemy is any more 
and the attacks are random said author randy osofsky one of the 
friends with her during early saturdays attack these are the 
things that make you want to move out of the city 
but ms lindfors who was mugged in 1982 said that would be a 
mistake 
we all struggle with those thoughts we all have fear that 
says we have to get out of here but we have to fight back you 
dont want to be kicked out by kids or rats she said 
this is where we live me and my children and grandchildren 
and were not going to be kicked out by those bastards 
the slasher and victim said nothing in the attack which 
occurred as she and three friends stood talking in front of an 
apartment building 
suddenly a guy was right in front of me holding my face and 
the next second i was lying on the street i heard screams get 
him and i felt the blood she recalled 
and the next day she was wondering am i going to be afraid to 
walk the streets now i hate that feeling 
police on sunday reported no clues about the motive or 
identities of the small group of marauding young men believed 
responsible for the slashing and one that occurred a few minutes 
earlier and a few blocks away 
ms lindfors and dennis beal 36 were cut on the face by a 
member of the gang 
despite the ear and facial wound that required 27 stitches the 
69yearold actress was back on stage a few hours later for a 
poetry reading later she mixed pity of her attackers with anger 
how do we fight back how do we struggle against this kind of 
thing ms lindfors asked 
i only know one way and that is to keep on performing what is 
of spiritual value to people 
if i could get into schools and read poetry to these kids 
couldnt they turn their passion and that turbulence into the 
strong life force use this life force in a positive way 
even so she showed compassion for her attacker im coming 
off easily compared to him my ear is cut but his life is going 
to be hell if he doesnt face something within himself 
ms lindfors a classically trained actress who spent eight 
years with the royal dramatic theater in her native sweden has 
performed in scores of plays films and television shows 
her films include night unto night in 1948 with ronald 
reagan four men in a jeep in 1948 the way we were in

unable to keep the ku klux klan 
permanently out of town where it was founded residents say some 
good has emerged from the racist groups annual marches against a 
holiday for martin luther king jr 
for the first time my community is sitting down and talking 
openly about problems that exist said bob henry president of 
giles countians united formed to display the communitys rejection 
of the white supremacist groups that have marched here every martin 
luther king holiday weekend since 1986 
pulaskis not a perfect town we have racism here we are a 
town that recognizes its problems and is moving forward and working 
to solve them 
henrys group outmaneuvered the klan this year forcing the klan 
to hold its march in a neighboring town about 300 white 
supremacists marched saturday in lawrenceburg while about 300 
counterdemonstrators marched in pulaski 
but klan leaders said they would try to return to pulaski next 
year on the weekend of the federal holiday for king the slain 
civilrights leader who would have turned 61 today 
the klan picked pulaski a town of 8000 people about 70 miles 
south of nashville because it was where the group was founded in 
1865 the modern klan traces its roots to another branch founded in 
1915 in stone mountain ga 
this year henrys group obtained a parade permit first and the 
city won a legal battle in federal court to prohibit marches by 
more than one group a day 
about 200 klan members or supporters still showed up saturday 
morning for a rally on the steps of the giles county courthouse 
and pulaski police cited thom robb the klans national director 
with violating the citys parade ordinance after he held a news 
conference 
moving to lawrenceburg the klan members were joined by about 
another 100 white supremacists three people were arrested on 
disorderly conduct charges after confronting klan members 
authorities said 
klan officials and supporters accused town leaders of conspiring 
to keep them out and pulaski officials didnt deny it saying 
theyre tired of negative publicity sparked by the racist group 
scott shepherd head of a group called the national association 
for the advancement of white people and a candidate for the 
tennessee legislature from memphis promised the klan would be back 
in pulaski next year 
i understand we cant apply for 160 days prior to the 
parade shepherd said but i can guarantee that on the 160th 
day prior to that parade ill be here at 8 oclock to apply for a 
permit

former us sen joseph s clark who swept 
the old guard out of city hall and tried to do the same in the 
halls of congress has died he was 88 
clark died at home friday said his wife iris no cause of 
death was given 
clark is remembered for civilservice reforms during the 1950s 
as philadelphias first democratic mayor in 67 years and for his 
advocacy of civilrights and congressional reform in washington 
dc 
a series of speeches he gave in 1963 later published in book 
form as the senate establishment attacked the upper chamber of 
congress as a selfperpetuating oligarchy he also wrote 
another book congress the sapless branch 
clark received a law degree from the university of pennsylvania 
during world war ii he was chief of staff for the eastern air 
command in the chinaburmaindia theater 
in 1951 he was elected mayor ending a corruptionridden 
republican administration he replaced the citys spoils system 
with civil service regulations 
clark said later his major accomplishments as mayor were the 
reform of the police taking them out of politics and the 
opening of a career service in city government to blacks 
no public servant has done more for the city than joe clark 
said mayor w wilson goode 
clark made a point of challenging racist traditions he took 
black friends to the philadelphia cricket club near his home the 
first time in the clubs 100year history that blacks had been 
guests 
if i hadnt been made a life member by my father the day i was 
born they probably would have asked for my resignation he said 
in 1956 clark was elected to the first of two senate terms 
he sponsored the manpower development and training act and the 
area redevelopment act but was often frustrated by the chambers 
ruling powers 
the senate establishment is almost the antithesis of 
democracy clark told his senate colleagues in 1963 it is what 
might be called a selfperpetuating oligarchy with only mild 
overtones of a plutocracy 
james macgregor burns the pulitzer prizewinning historian 
called clarks speech of historical significance because it aims 
squarely at this centuryold coalition as it operates quietly in 
the senate he has moved the power process out of dim and musty 
committee and caucus rooms into the spotlight of the senate floor 
clark didnt intially support john f kennedys 1960 
presidential campaign but he campaigned hard after the 
massachusetts senator was nominated kennedy asked him to draw up a 
civilrights program for his new frontier program 
clark eventually rose in the senate gaining seats on the 
foreign relations labor and public welfare and rules and 
administration committees 
his relations with president johnson were cool at best 
although he supported johnsons vietnam war policy in the 1964 
gulf of tonkin resolution in the senate he broke with the 
administration within a year 
back home clark earned many political enemies in his own party 
when he declared during the 1963 primaries its time to knock 
sleazy government out of the box in western pennsylvania 
when he sought reelection in 1968 local democratic leaders 
failed to work enthusiastically for him and he lost to republican 
richard schweiker 
clark later spent two years as chairman of world federalists 
usa a washingtonbased that promotes an effective world 
government 
besides his wife survivors include a son daughter and 
stepdaughter 
a private funeral was held sunday

pope john paul ii canceled all his 
activities today because of the flu a vatican spokesman said 
monsignor piero pennacchini the deputy vatican spokesman gave 
no details of the popes symptoms 
he said john paul had been scheduled to receive a number of 
visitors including 50 members of the chinese national circus the 
head of the jesuit order peterhans kolvenbach louis sullivan 
the us health and human services secretary and cardinal josef 
tomko prefect of the congregation for the evangelization of 
peoples 
the 69yearold pope himself disclosed he was suffering from the 
flu during a visit to a rome parish on sunday 
perhaps youre surprised by the fact that the pope even 
though hes a step away from the children doesnt hug and kiss 
them the pope joked he was about to do so but then he 
thought that he has a virus and since theres enough influenza 
going around there isnt reason to add more to the contagion 
a few minutes earlier as soon as he finished saying mass the 
pope had a hot beverage and took some medicine to counter fever 
the ansa news agency reported 
asked how high the papal fever was the popes doctor renato 
buzzonetti was quoted as telling a reporter i dont know and 
if i did i wouldnt tell you 
the flu began hitting italians in december starting mainly in 
northern italy and moving down the peninsula to recently grip 
romans especially children

martin luther king 3rd eldest son of the 
slain civilrights leader said his father would have been 
embarrassed by city officials resistance to a court order to build 
more integrated housing 
it is really kind of contradictory that the city officials of 
yonkers would want to celebrate a martin luther king holiday and 
not try to live out what martin king was about king said during 
a breakfast speech sunday the day before the national holiday 
celebrating what would have been his fathers 61st birthday 
if he were here i think he would be embarrassed said king 
who was 10 years old when his father was assassinated in 1968 
do you want to go down in history for doing what was expedient 
and popular or for doing what was right king asked the audience 
of about 500 city officials and residents 
the audience was mostly black but it also included yonkers 
newlyelected mayor henry spallone 
spallone was one of four city council members who defied a 
federal judges ruling that found consistent and extreme 
housing segregation and ordered more integrated lowincome housing 
built 
last week the us supreme court overturned contempt fines for 
the council members but did not rule on the judges discrimination 
finding 
spallone campaigned for mayor on a pledge to continue the 
resistance 
in an interview after kings speech spallone rejected the 
implication that yonkers is a racist city he said the city has 
more lowincome housing than any other municipality in westchester 
county 
but he also said some compromise on housing might be found 
whats great about america is that there is always dialogue 
and always common ground to be reached spallone said

james meredith whose enrollment as 
the first black at the university of mississippi sparked rioting in 
1962 now is fighting white liberals instead of white supremacists 
i was engaged in a war and the only thing that has changed is 
the enemy meredith told reporters sunday on the eve of the 
national holiday honoring slain civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr 
when we went to mississippi my enemy was the white 
supremacists my enemy now is the white liberal 
his enrollment at ole miss resulted in riots that were 
suppressed by federal troops but he since has called integration 
the biggest con job ever pulled on anybody 
meredith said he never considered himself a part of the 
civilrights movement 
thats always been an insult to me he said 
meredith blamed many of societys ills on a liberal elite 
which he said wants to keep blacks in a secondclass position under 
the pretext of helping them 
meredith surprised civilrights activists in september when he 
went to work as an adviser to archconservative sen jesse helms 
rnc 
since helms election to the senate in 1972 he has vigorously 
opposed civilrights legislation and other domestic programs 
favored by many blacks 
meredith speaking to reporters before an address at mount 
holyoke college had little to say about king or helms opposition 
to creating of the king holiday 
the issue is not about martin luther kings birthday being a 
national holiday he said the issue is about the martin luther 
king holiday commission 
helms has opposed funding for the federal commission congress 
set up to promote the holiday he says establishing such a 
commission for one individual sets a bad precedent

a powerful provincial governor today 
threatened to lead a people power uprising if president corazon 
aquinos administration removes him for alleged links to last 
months failed coup 
however the presidential spokesman said the government was 
determined to prosecute the governor and the speaker of the house 
of representatives demanded that the military take action against 
the provincial leader 
the governor rodolfo aguinaldo a former lieutenant colonel of 
the philippine constabulary and one of the most colorful 
personalities in philippine politics also said he may order his 
constituents in cagayan province to attack corrupt government 
officials 
where would i go if i am suspended or expelled aguinaldo 
asked in a telephone interview from his office in tuguegarao 200 
miles northeast of manila 
i have only my principles they government officials are 
harassing me what will i do i will fight fight and fight thats 
it he added 
aguinaldo said that if he were removed from office he would ask 
his constituents to stage massive demonstrations like the 1986 
people power revolt that swept mrs aquino to the presidency 
and ousted the late ferdinand marcos 
the people will be enjoined to rise up against the dirty 
politicians and the corrupt officials aguinaldo said perhaps 
the people will stone these officials houses bang on their pajero 
jeeps and mercedes seize their overpriced cement sort of a 
massive people power 
local government secretary luis santos suspended aguinaldo from 
office last week because the governor allegedly sent troops to 
manila to back the dec 19 failed putsch the sixth and bloodiest 
bid to topple mrs aquino 
however aguinaldo has refused to vacate his post and filed a 
civil suit challenging the suspension order he also refused to 
comment on allegations he helped mutinous soldiers in the december 
coup attempt which left at least 113 people dead and more than 500 
wounded 
presidential spokesman adolf azcuna said the department of 
justice has issued a subpoena to aguinaldo asking the governor to 
appear at a preliminary investigation hearing on rebellion charges 
against him on jan 26 in manila 
this shows that the government though not as fast as perhaps 
our instincts would want us to move is determined to throw 
the book at this recalcitrant local official azcuna said 
he said the suspension order was an administrative measure 
while the rebellion charges filed by santos with the justice 
department was a criminal case against aguinaldo 
under philippine law a preliminary investigation has to be 
undertaken by government prosecutors before a formal case is filed 
in a court 
also today house speaker ramon mitra expressed anger at 
aguinaldos threats and said the military must do something 
forceful and decisive against the governor who was making a 
fool out of the government 
do they the military authorities expect the president to 
pick up a gun and enforce her order by herself mitra said do 
they want the president to go to cagayan and get aguinaldo 
herself 
in his comments aguinaldo said this government is bent on 
getting me very soon there will be action here 
he said he may be forced to go up the hills a phrase which 
locally means becoming a rebel if he is expelled but aguinaldo 
said he was confident he would be protected by his people 
aguinaldo was implicated but never charged in an august 1987 
coup attempt afterward he resigned from the armed forces and 
raised a private army ostensibly to fight communist rebels he was 
elected governor of cagayan in january 1988

communist partys political monopoly and agreed to discuss further 
constitutional changes with the opposition which is demanding a 
swifter transition to democracy

constitution that guaranteed communist supremacy in bulgaria for 44

the pressure on legislators and demand the immediate dismissal of 
old guard communists still in the leadership they chanted

restoration of the rights of the turkishspeaking minority that 
arose from talks last week among communists opposition figures 
nationalist leaders and ethnic turks 
the declaration aims to defuse ethnic tensions between slavic 
nationalists and members of bulgarias estimated 12 million ethnic 
turks 
they also adopted a proposal by andrei lukanov the no 2 
official in the communist party to set up the group that is to

bulgaria as a socialist state headed by the working class

nov 10 after 34 years in power 
leaders of the prodemocracy opposition union of democratic 
forces also read excerpts from a declaration agreed upon friday by

list of demands that include twostage legislative elections in 
may and november removing communist cells from the army police 
and workplace and scrapping the constitutional guarantees of

from the steps of alexander nevski cathedral called for some 
parliamentary seats held by zhivkov cronies to be contested in may 
with a full general election in november

even albania so we demand democratic guarantees beron shouted 
to the crowd who sang and cheered in almost a holiday mood 
he also called for a full report on the finances of the secret 
police and the removal of all former zhivkov collaborators from the 
government 
in explaining the call for twostage elections the opposition 
movements president zhelio zhelev told reporters the opposition 
had no time to prepare for full general elections provisionally 
slated for may 
we couldnt win full elections in may but in november we have 
a good chance he said

rallies parliament president stanko todorov called on sofias 
mayor and police to protect assembly members and ensure necessary 
conditions for the normal working of parliament 
todorovs request in a letter was read on state television 
mladenov a former foreign minister has promised democratic 
changes including free elections and freedom of the press 
but the opposition has criticized him for the slow speed of 
reform and for allowing former zhivkov associates to remain in 
highranking party positions 
after nov 10 our newlyreformed leaders promised to tell us 
the real situation but were still waiting said mihail 
mihailov one of the 20plus speakers at the rally 
fridays agreement on the ethnic situation confirms a dec 29 
government decree guaranteeing turks rights to reassume their own 
names after years of forced assimilation under zhivkov 
nationalists had demanded the decree be revoked pending a 
national referendum but appeared to be satisfied with fridays 
declaration guaranteeing bulgarias territorial integrity and 
bulgarian as the national language 
some demonstrators sunday carried banners that read 
apologize apparently referring to nationalists accusations 
that prodemocracy leaders were unpatriotic because they 
supported the minority rights

chinese police reduced surveillance around the 
us embassy to its lowest level since june an embassy spokesman 
said today prompting speculation of an accord on a chinese 
dissident who took refuge inside 
however embassy spokesman spokesman sheridan w bell moved to 
squelch such talk saying the chinese gave no reason for their move 
if a secret agreement has been reached its a secret to me 
he said 
astrophysicist fang lizhi and his wife fled to the embassy in 
june when china cracked down on prodemocracy protesters since 
then their presence at the embassy has been a major irritant in 
uschinese relations 
however neither side has acknowledged even holding talks on the 
fangs for whom the chinese have issued arrest warrants as 
counterrevolutionaries china said last week that the only 
way out for the couple was to plead guilty 
the fangs presence has prompted heavy chinese surveillance 
since june at the main embassy building and at the ambassadors 
residence several blocks away the united states has not said in 
which compound the fangs are living 
the surveillance peaked in early november when dozens of 
uniformed and plainclothes police watched the compounds gates and 
their black mercedes with dark windows and no license plates lined 
the blocks 
the number of police dropped gradually in november but reached a 
new low late last week according to bell today the main embassy 
building was guarded only by five uniformed police with automatic 
pistols while three guarded the ambassadors residence 
only one police car was sighted in the area an unmarked 
mercedes with two men inside that was parked on a sidewalk a block 
from the residence 
we have called for the chinese repeatedly in the past to 
remove the extra troops weapons and cars from in front of the 
buildings bell said now the unmarked cars are no longer 
parked in front of the embassy buildings all we know is that 
they are gone 
immediately after the fangs took refuge at the embassy police 
outside began carrying automatic rifles and wearing helmets 
however they switched back to their usual pistols in november 
when former us president richard nixon visited and complained 
earlier this month a chinawatching magazine in hong kong 
reported that fang would be allowed to leave the embassy and go 
into exile in australia or another country later in january 
the chineselanguage pai shing semimonthly reported that the 
united states and china had reached an understanding on 
resolving the impasse over fang when us national security adviser 
brent scowcroft visited beijing in december 
the scowcroft trip was denounced by many us lawmakers and 
others who believed it too early to resume highlevel talks with 
china which washington suspended after troops killed hundreds of 
unarmed civilians june 34 in clearing central beijing of 
prodemocracy protesters 
the critics argued that china had made no corresponding 
concession pai shing noted that an agreement on fang would ease 
criticism of president bushs decision to send his national 
security adviser to china

vietnamese boat people in hong kong suffer 
beatings by security forces and many could risk political 
persecution when they are forced back to their communist homeland 
amnesty international charged today 
the londonbased human rights group urged the hong kong 
government to stop its forced repatriation program which began in 
december to ease the burden of detaining the refugees 
the fundamental rights of people who face a genuine risk of 
persecution are being violated said the report which was based 
on a recent factfinding mission to hong kong 
the hong kong government called the report unfounded and 
said it was committed to its policy of sending the vietnamese home 
amnesty accused the hong kong government of mistreating the 51 
boat people who were forcibly returned to vietnam in december 
it quoted witnesses as saying security forces dragged them from 
the chi ma wan detention center in a dawn raid on oct 31 using 
kicks beatings and choke holds 
hong kongs secretary of security geoffrey barnes said a 
minimum of necessary force was used on that occasion 
there is no truth whatsoever in the accusation that people at 
chi ma wan were illtreated or rendered unconscious he said in a 
statement 
the refugees were then taken to another detention center the 
phoenix house early dec 12 hundreds of security forces in riot 
gear brought them to the international airport 
during that operation reporters did not see any evidence of 
brutality 
the report also charged the government with quashing 
investigations of official misconduct in the camps citing two 
incidents when 200 boat people were allegedly beaten and kicked by 
security forces last year in the high island detention center it 
said unruly boat people are routinely locked in empty subdivided 
cargo containers for several days 
the report said many vietnamese feared that if they spoke up 
about abuses they faced possible retribution by the police and 
risked unfavorable treatment in the screening process 
amnesty criticized the screening process to separate refugees 
with the right to find a new country from economic migrants 
who will be forced back to vietnam 
of the 40000 vietnamese awaiting screening an estimated 85 
percent face forced repatriation they make up the bulk of boat 
people who arrived after midjune 1988 when hong kong stopped 
automatically granting refugee status 
under the screening process boat people are given a hearing 
with an immigration officer they can appeal the decision once 
as of tuesday 7567 vietnamese had been refused refugee status 
and 1889 had lost appeals so far 997 have voluntarily returned 
to vietnam 
amnesty said that during the screening process boat people 
receive no legal advice and are often interviewed by immigration 
officers with scant knowledge of the human rights situation in 
vietnam 
the report cited one case of an immigration officer who seemed 
unaware that vietnam had once been divided into two countries a 
communist north and a capitalist south 
another case involved a young vietnamese who was refused refugee 
status even though he allegedly was fleeing a fiveyear term of 
political imprisonment in vietnam 
an emergency intervention of the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees provided the man refugee status 
however barnes defended the screening process saying hong kong 
has given the benefit of the doubt to many refugees 
but he said the colony would proceed with forced repatriation 
they have no alternative but to return to vietnam to restart 
their lives he said it would be wrong and cannot be humane to 
leave them in detention indefinitely 
vietnam has promised not to prosecute or mistreat the boat 
people for fleeing their homeland but the amnesty report said it 
fears that local officials may persecute those who return 
timothy raison a british parliamentarian who visited some of 
the forcibly repatriated boat people has said he found no sign of 
persecution

president francois mitterrand today opened a 
34nation conference to form an eastern european development bank 
and urged delegates to move quickly to clear that regions path 
toward free markets 
the nations are expected to agree to put at least 12 billion 
into the bank in what could become one of the largest regional 
assistance programs since the us marshall plan that rebuilt 
western europe after world war ii 
opening the twoday conference to form the european bank for 
reconstruction and development in eastern europe mitterrand 
expressed hope the bank could be operating by the spring 
if we dont move fast enough we risk being passed up by 
events he told delegates from both eastern and western europe 
he asked them to move at a speed that isnt traditional in 
international affairs 
mitterrand proposed the idea of the bank to leaders of the 
12nation european community in november and the group of western 
european nations formally approved the concept at last months 
summit in strasbourg 
under that plan the bank would provide loans loan guarantees 
economic and technical assistance and make equity investments in 
some projects in poland czechoslovakia hungary east germany 
romania and bulgaria 
all those countries are undergoing democratic transformations 
mitterrand has suggested the loans be tied to progress toward 
democratic elections 
the deficitplagued united states has given western europe the 
lead in the plan saying it is more familiar with the problems of 
eastern europe 
the starting point of the talks will be a french proposal that 
the ec hold a majority share of 53 percent of the capital the four 
largest countries france britain west germany and italy have 
reportedly been asked to hold 85 percent each 
the united states japan and soviet union would each hold 85 
percent as would the european free trade association composed of 
switzerland austria sweden norway finland and iceland 
eastern european countries other than the soviet union would 
hold a total of 65 percent the others shares would be divided 
among the remaining nations including australia canada and new 
zealand 
negotiations on the bank could be concluded by the end of march 
ec spokesmen said but it could take more than a year before 
ratification and approval by individual governments on their 
contributions 
a second round of talks is envisioned for feb 19 
other issues include whether the bank should lend money 
significantly below market rates and whether loans should be made 
only to the private sector or also to finance public sector 
projects 
the united states and some other countries also have 
reservations about whether the soviet union should be a borrower as 
well as a shareholder 
undersecretary of the treasury david mulford and undersecretary 
of state for economic affairs robert mccormack are leading the us 
delegation to the conference 
the ec has been coordinating international efforts to aid the 
emerging democracies in poland and hungary so far about 6 
billion in food aid grants loans and trade have been donated or 
committed by 24 industrialized nations

quakerelated calls to suicide hotlines 
have dropped to a fraction after three months but unsettling 
reminders of the earths fury remain a shopping mall in a seaside 
town resembles an abandoned movie set hundreds of people are still 
homeless and major sections of freeways are still closed or 
detoured 
aftershocks have subsided since the earthquake of 71 magnitude 
shook northern california on oct 17 but the recovery efforts 
expected to take years are apparent as hammering and the hum of 
heavy construction equipment fill the air from san francisco and 
downtown oakland to watsonville 
the 15second temblor injured 2500 people killed 67 and left 
10000 homeless 7 billion damage made it the nations costliest 
quake ever almost 70000 claims have been filed with the federal 
emergency management agency in the san francisco bay area for 
temporary housing help home and business loans grants and other 
aid the american red cross says 14000 families probably will have 
received temporary shelter clothes blankets food and other help 
the eyes of sports fans across the country were on candlestick 
park and a world series game between the san francisco giants and 
the oakland as when the quake hit the ballpark was in the 
limelight again this weekend as the 49ers beat the los angeles rams 
303 to clinch a super bowl berth 
life is not as anxious as it was for anyone but it isnt the 
same for anyone itll never be the same again said eve 
meyer executive director of the san francisco suicide prevention 
hotline which saw quakerelated calls drop from a peak of about 
200 a day to the current average two a day 
they say in about six months itll be back to normal and 
everyone will forget all about it said erik carlson of mahopac 
ny the quake damaged his spine and left him paralyzed from the 
waist down in the wreckage of the collapsed cypress section of the 
nimitz freeway in oakland 
how could i look at what it did to my body he said 
and while watsonvilles fox theater marquee wishes passersby 
happy new year in english and spanish that prospect remains 
dubious for many of the estimated 1000 people left homeless in the 
agricultural community 70 miles south of san francisco 
maria alvarez and her husband slept in a parking lot with their 
five children and several other families for four nights after the 
quake now they have a trailer supplied by the federal government 
for 18 months but after that she doesnt know if they can afford 
to rent a new home 
ive been living here for about 30 years now to move 
somewhere else i wouldnt feel right to start again its hard to 
do alvarez said standing in the 40trailer crestview camp one 
of a halfdozen in the watsonville area 
at least theyre secure now said mayor todd mc farren 
but they have a lot of fears about whats going to happen in 18 
months and i dont have an answer for them 
mc farren expressed concern for the future of the city that 
sustained 60 million in damage and lost 400000 in sales tax and 
200000 in property tax a lot of workers have left town and the 
canneries are concerned they wont come back in the spring the 
words out theres no place left to live 
the once quaint and tranquil pacific garden mall is the focal 
point for damage in neighboring santa cruz 60 miles from san 
francisco near the quakes loma prieta epicenter today it 
resembles an abandoned movie set or a ghost town most of the 
buildings with broken windows chipped walls and tilted frames 
are fenced off others have been demolished leaving huge holes 
around the malls fringe are vinyl pods where 45 businesses 
have set up temporary shop for what may be a twoyear stay one 
shop displayed leftover holiday tshirts proclaiming yes 
virginia there is a santa cruz 
in san franciscos marina district near the golden gate bridge 
for rent signs some vouching for the safety of the premises 
fill apartment windows and vacant lots abound where buildings were 
torn down the embarcadero freeway once a key entrance to the 
waterfront and chinatown is closed its future is uncertain as 
officials debate environmental economic and public safety 
implications of its repair 
a survey by the san francisco economic development corp shows 
the citys 34 billion tourism industry has been hard hit the 
number of spouses coming with conventioneers and the number of 
leisure travelers who account for half of all visitors from 
outside the region is down a third from a year ago 
its been hard to convince outsiders the city is safe that 
this isnt soviet armenia said san francisco visitors and 
convention bureau spokeswoman sharon rooney weve proven we can 
rebound from that the cable cars were running within 48 hours 
after the earthquake 
were a city probably better prepared than any other city for 
an earthquake 
across the bay in oakland where the cypress section of the 
nimitz freeway crumpled like a paper fan and killed 42 people all 
but a small portion of the roadway has been demolished a 1mile 
swath like a glaring scar divides the heavily damaged downtown 
and a neighborhood ravaged by drugrelated violence 
city hall has been vacated as authorities consider spending an 
estimated 40 million to 50 million for repairs and a major 
department store long vital to a struggling economy faces 8 
million to 10 million in renovation bills 
in addition alameda county needs 20 million to keep homeless 
shelters open and up to 100 million to repair residential hotels 
closed by the quake said county supervisors chairman don perata 
erik carlson for one will never be convinced of the regions 
safety i would come back but i wouldnt stay long he said 
shortly before leaving to return to new york live in california 
out completely no way

about 2000 people filled the citys main 
cathedral today for a onehour funeral mass for the 43 people 
killed in a discotheque fire which medical examiners said had 
released deadly fumes 
medical examiners found fatal levels of carbon monoxide in blood 
samples taken from all of the victims of the fire early sunday 
said judge javier seoane who is heading up the judicial 
investigation in this northeastern city 
he added the samples had been sent to madrid for further tests 
to determine if other poisonous gases were present 
the victims apparently died from the hydrocyanic acid as well as 
carbon monoxide poisoning government spokesman ignacio bruna said 
many of the victims died in their seats in the basement lounge 
both types of fumes can be given off when carpets drapes 
furniture coverings and other synthetic material made from certain 
compounds come into contact with intense heat civil protection 
chief antonio herrero said 
the victims included five members of a band playing in the 
lounge and the parents and wife of one of the dead musicians the 
spanish news agency efe said 
a us military base is about 10 miles west of zaragoza but the 
discotheque was not frequented by us servicemen and authorities 
said all the victims were local residents 
one woman remained hospitalized with serious injuries doctors 
said a firefighter and another customer were treated and released 
the fire began in the flying discotheque in a rundown section 
of zaragoza when an electrical overload triggered a short circuit 
it was extinguished in minutes 
however toxic smoke poured through airconditioning ducts to 
the basement where the dance floor bar and lounge are located 
said a local government representative carlos perez anadon 
investigators found traces of hydrocyanic acid in the lounge 
said bruna 
perez anadon said the official cause of the fire and the deaths 
would not be determined until autopsies were completed but he 
added that hydrocyanic acid is commonly mixed with water in 
executions by poisonous gas the acid is also sometimes used as a 
fumigant 
however spanish national radio said the chemical used to 
produce acrylic fibers may have been in material for the 
discotheques interior decoration 
perez anadon said records indicated the clubs owners had not 
used materials with the chemical which is prohibited by city fire 
laws 
herrero said about 5 percent of all synthetic fibers including 
acrylics contain hydrocyanic acid 
investigators said they first suspected hydrocyanic acid because 
the victims were overcome so quickly 
they didnt make any type of movement to protect themselves 
said herrero who arrived at the discotheque with rescue workers 
deputy mayor luis garcia nieto said firefighters arrived eight 
minutes after they received news of the fire but he said rescue 
workers could do little to help those inside 
several people died in their seats it was very fast added 
antonio gonzalez trivino mayor of zaragoza a provincial capital 
200 miles northeast of madrid 
perez anadon and gonzalez trivino both said the disco appeared 
to be in compliance with fire laws enacted in december 1983 after a 
fire at a madrid disco killed 79 people 
it was the second catastrophic fire in zaragoza in a decade 
more than 70 people died in a july 1979 blaze at the corona de 
aragon hotel

a blind woman identified a 14yearold boy as the 
person who raped her in her apartment buildings laundry room by 
smelling his cologne and touching his hands police said 
the 24yearold woman legally blind for three years 
immediately recognized the scent of the suspects cologne and later 
felt his hands in a lineup at a police station investigators said 
the assailant held his hands over the victims mouth during the 
attack 
it was the smell of his cologne the woman said sunday 
that was the major key i could tell too by the size of his 
hands and how rough or smooth they were 
the boy accused in the rape lives in the victims apartment 
building and on the same floor police knocked on his door during 
their investigation and the victim who accompanied the 
investigators got a whiff of his cologne 
a lot of people cant even give a good description of a 
rapist said police detective catherine fitzgibbon yet this 
woman was able to pick him out by his touch and smell it was 
remarkable 
ive never heard of a blind woman being able to pick someone 
out of a lineup fitzgibbon said 
another officer however cautioned that such identifications

the five permanent members of the un security 
council met today to discuss what many see as the best chance in 
years to end the cambodian civil war 
the closeddoor meeting followed reports that khmer rouge 
guerrillas had taken territory from cambodias vietnamesebacked 
government and attacked the countrys two largest cities 
the khmer rouge radio reported today that thousands of people 
fled the western city of battambang following a guerrilla attack 
jan 5 the report could not be confirmed 
representatives from britain china france the united states 
and the soviet union began talks this morning diplomatic sources 
said it was unlikely a statement on the progress of the talks would 
be issued before the meeting ends tuesday 
the foreign ministry issued a statement as the talks began 
urging the diplomats to find a solution to allow an end to the 
murderous conflict tearing apart cambodia that prevents a return to 
power by the khmer rouge 
about a dozen supporters of the noncommunist resistance in 
cambodia gathered outside the international conference center to 
protest the khmer rouge and the vietnameseinstalled government in 
phnom penh 
the people of cambodia cannot and the free world should not 
resign themselves to an alternative between two despotisms said 
a statement signed by 41 french parliamentarians supporting the 
protesters 
hundreds of thousands of people died during the communist khmer 
rouges 3year grip on power which ended when vietnam invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 since september when vietnam said it 
withdrew the last of its troops from cambodia concern has risen 
that the khmer rouge would again seize power 
the security council delegates likely will focus on an 
australian proposal for an interim un administration to run 
cambodia until free elections can be held 
cambodias disputed seat in the united nations held by the 
threeparty guerrilla alliance since 1982 would be left vacant 
until a new government is elected 
the plan received a boost friday after a soviet deputy foreign 
minister igor rogachev announced the soviet union and china have 
agreed the united nations should play a very major role in a 
settlement 
the announcement holds promise for the talks since the soviets 
arm the communist government of prime minister hun sen and china 
arms the khmer rouge the strongest rebel group 
france britain and the united states have reacted favorably to 
the australian plan vietnam and phnom penh have lent conditional 
support so has prince norodom sihanouk leader of the alliance 
and former prime minister son sann head of its smallest faction

about 18 million 20yearolds officially became 
adults today in ceremonies commemorating coming of age day a 
national holiday 
women dressed in beautiful pink and gold japanese kimonos and 
men in western suits filled the streets of tokyo in keeping with a 
custom in which young people are given new clothes upon reaching 
maturity 
but instead of heading for ancient temples to be confirmed as 
adults in religious or cultural rites the young people went to 
municipal offices where mayors presided over brief ceremonies and 
urged them to be good citizens 
coming of age day has little meaning as a rite of passage for 
many contemporary japanese youth however 
at 20 years old they gain the legal right to drink smoke and 
vote for the first time but many young japanese and been drinking 
and smoking for years and many 20yearold do not even attend the 
event 
ritsuko hagiwara a university student in tokyo wrote the 
leading newspaper asahi shimbun that she decided not to participate 
in the holiday and would use money from her parents intended for a 
new kimono instead for a trip abroad with friends 
although i was attracted by the gorgeous invitation sent by 
the city government ive begun to have doubts about the whole 
thing comingofage day was originally supposed to celebrate 
becoming an adult and afterward one was supposed to be able to live 
independently but im still a student and will have to be 
taken care of by my parents for the next three years she wrote

charles stuarts crime went far beyond the murder 
of his pregnant wife rushing an undercurrent of racial tensions to 
the surface that spread fresh dirt on a city often portrayed as an 
educational and cultural center 
it became a crime story that played nationally because it fit 
so neatly with our national tragedy of racial discord said mayor 
raymond l flynn the most evil thing about this awful fraud 
was that it hurt the heart and the soul of a city that has worked 
so hard to break down the racial barriers that for years divided 
it 
the bullet that killed carol stuart touched everyone for the 
worst including the state of massachusetts and its governor 
michael s dukakis who have been the butt of daily ridicule for 
big spending taxes low bond ratings and the falling star of the 
massachusetts miracle economy 
but this time public anger mostly from blacks was directed at 
flynn and boston police it was the mayor who ordered a giant 
dragnet in the mission hill neighborhood after stuart told 
authorities that a black gunman forced his way into the white 
couples car as they left a hospital birthing class oct 23 then 
robbed and shot them 
stuarts desperate pleas over his car phone that guided police 
to the couple were later broadcast and published nationally along 
with photos of him and his mortally wounded wife bloodied in their 
car 
the grim images exacerbated white fears of a crimeridden city 
where in the two months before there had been nearly 200 shootings 
in neighborhoods where large numbers of blacks live 
before mrs stuarts murder police had been fanning through the 
neighborhoods frisking black men in efforts to halt the crime 
spree then with the city outraged over the murder of mrs stuart 
blacks said police were out of control violating their 
constitutional rights and trying to intimidate them 
as it turned out stuarts story was the big lie when police 
started to close in on him after a brother matthew fingered him 
stuart leaped off a bridge jan 4 his suicide cleared a black man 
who had been labeled by police sources as the prime suspect 
william bennett a 39yearold exconvict with a record of 60 
arrests including jail time for shooting a policeman 
the citys image was further tainted as black witnesses charged 
that police had manipulated evidence and put words in their mouths 
that pinned the crime on bennett 
flynn a potential democratic gubernatorial candidate this year 
was so concerned about bostons image as well as his own that he 
devoted nearly half his annual state of the city speech last 
wednesday to the stuart case 
when i ordered an aggressive police reponse i wanted to 
send a strong signal as strong as i could to show the citys 
outrage and to show that we would not tolerate such an act he 
said 
boston was branded a racist city 15 years ago when forced busing 
to integrate city schools erupted in violence just as today the 
stereotype was accepted said flynn who as a city councilor 
during the 1970s helped lead the opposition to busing 
what seemed to gall whites more than anything was that stuart 
was able to pull off the hoax 
im embarrassed what it did to the city said jeanine 
fowler a 34yearold bartender at the bull and finch pub a 
tourist spot on which the bar in the tv show cheers is modeled 
he took advantage of our prejudices that we all do have people 
say boston is supposed to be such an educated city and cultural 
center and then this happens and that makes us preying on the 
black community and he stuart created this all himself 
on the thursday that stuart committed suicide news of his 
plunge into boston harbor was all over the television in the bull 
and finch while the local customers and the help were watching for 
every new detail most of the tourists were more interested in 
seeing the citys sights 
ashley mccown a marketing associate for the massachusetts 
office of travel and tourism said there is no way to judge how the 
stuart case might affect the more than 8 billion tourism business 
in the state 
but bob cumings president of the greater boston convention and 
visitors bureau said he had just returned from major industry 
meetings in new orleans and there was no indication anyone was 
considering scratching boston

while federal prosecutors were moving to 
indict panamas manuel antonio noriega on narcotics charges the 
drug enforcement administration was maintaining close ties with him 
and offering praise for his cooperation in the war against drugs a 
congressional report shows 
the dea has long welcomed our close association and we stand 
ready to proceed jointly against international drug traffickers 
whenever the opportunity arises drug enforcement administrator 
jack lawn wrote to noriega less than a year before the indictment 
was entered in federal court in miami in february 1988 
lawn had special praise for the work of luis quiel noriegas 
liaison to the dea as integral to the success of fighting 
international drug trafficking 
but according to the final report of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on narcotics issued in december 1988 quiel 
was also noriegas liaison to the medellin drug cartel and thus 
in a position to alert the drug traffickers to whatever information 
the dea had provided him 
quiel also acted as noriegas enforcer to eliminate 
competitors of the medellin cartel by turning them over to the 
united states the panel said 
lawns predecessor as dea administrator francis m mullen told 
the day newspaper of new london conn last week that he had been 
surprised by noriegas indictment because he was our fairhaired 
boy down there 
whenever wed ask him for help hed always give it to us 
said mullen who left dea in 1985 
the report issued in december 1988 after a threeyear 
investigation paints a vivid portrait of noriega and his 
involvement with drugs money laundering gun running and other 
illegal activities over his 20year rise to power as panamas 
military strongman 
the first links between panamanian officials and narcotics 
traffickers were forged while gen omar torrijos ruled panama the 
report said 
but after torrijos died in an airplane crash in 1981 noriega 
took charge of the countrys most important institutions using 
them to generate revenue for officers of the new panamanian defense 
force and to exercise control over the drug traffic 
before he was ousted last month by the us invasion of his 
country noriega controlled the customs immigration and passport 
services civil aeronautics the national bank of panama and the 
attorney generals office he pushed legislation through the 
national assembly consolidating the national guard navy police 
and customs into a unified panamanian defense force under his 
command 
as head of the pdf noriega now controlled all elements of the 
panamanian government essential to the protection of drug 
trafficking and money laundering increasing his control over 
panama and enriching himself the panel said 
one witness ramon milian rodriguez a miamibased cubanborn 
accountant testified he negotiated an agreement with noriega in 
1979 on behalf of the medellin cartel which gave noriega a 
commission to provide security and handling for drug money arriving 
in panama to be laundered through its banking system 
pdf soldiers met planes ferrying billions of dollars in cash 
from miami guarded the money as it was loaded into armored cars 
and delivered it to the banco nacionale de panama according to the 
subcommittee 
milian rodriguez said noriega eliminated him as a middleman in 
1983 by arranging to have information about his money laundering 
operation passed on to the dea the tip resulted in his arrest and 
eventual prison sentence 
the panel said it had evidence to corroborate milian rodriguez 
story that noriegas cronies then took control of the money 
laundering business 
soon noriegas associates began to smuggle narcotics themselves 
using light planes the panel said but in 1984 noriegas 
interests clashed with those of the medellin cartel 
noriega the panel said had permitted the cartel to establish 
cocaine processing plants in panama including one at la palma in 
darien province near the colombian border 
it alleged that noriega accepted 5 million from the drug cartel 
to protect the facility 
but in midmay 1984 concerned about pressure from the dea 
noriega ordered his soldiers to raid the plant and arrest its 
employees 
feeling betrayed the cartels leaders ordered noriegas 
assassination the panel said quoting a noriega associate former 
panamanian intelligence official jose blandon 
blandon testified that noriega turned to cuban premier fidel 
castro and accepted castros recommendation that he return the 5 
million and the plant machinery and release the 23 persons who had 
been arrested 
us law enforcement agencies continued to view noriega as a 
friend of the united states the subcommittee said 
lawn the dea administrator wrote noriega on may 8 1986 
stating the deas appreciation for the vigorous antidrug 
trafficking policy that you have adopted which is reflected in the 
numerous expulsions from panama of accused traffickers 
the subcommittee noted lawns testimony that noriega was 
actively cooperating in such areas as crop eradication narcotics 
investigations money laundering and drug interdiction 
because the dea shared information with the panamanian 
government drug dealers linked to noriega were advised whether or 
not their planes were on a dea watch list the report said quoting 
witnesses 
francis mcneil former us ambassador to costa rica told the 
panel that while law enforcement and intelligence agencies worked 
closely with noriega the state department did not trust him 
in june 1986 he said a state department investigation 
concluded that noriega was corrupt but there was no clear evidence 
that he was involved with narcotics

lithuanias communist party chief was 
overwhelmingly elected the republics president today in a clear 
endorsement of his defiant stand toward moscow and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
algirdas brazauskas was elected 2284 with 19 abstentions by 
the republics supreme soviet legislature the tass news agency 
reported 
the republics supreme soviet also voted to limit voting rights 
for military personnel requiring them to have lived in lithuania 
for at least 10 years said eduardas potasinskas a journalist for 
lithuanian tv the measure in effect restricts voting in local 
elections feb 24 to servicemen from lithuania or a few 
longserving soldiers and sailors 
brazauskas 57 faced alternative candidates national 
legislator kazimeras motieka and romualdas ozolas a leader of the 
proindependence group sajudis 
potasinskas said the vote will strengthen the position of 
brazauskas in dealing with moscow 
brazauskas backed the lithuanian partys decision dec 20 to 
break away from the national communist part the first such break 
since the communists took over in moscow in 1917 
gorbachev who had denounced the move visited lithuania from 
thursday through saturday to try to persuade lithuanian communists 
to reverse their decision 
the lithuanians refused to budge and gorbachev failed to end the 
schism he concluded his visit saturday by saying he saw no 
tragedy in a multiparty system a change from his previous 
unconditional call for a oneparty system 
gorbachev pleaded for unity repeatedly but was confronted by 
proindependence demonstrators at many stops public opinion 
strongly supports independence for the baltic republic of 37 
million which was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
brazauskas has been the lithuanian partys first secretary since 
oct 20 1988 his new title the equivalent of president is 
chairman of the presidium of the republics supreme soviet he 
takes over from vytautas astrauskas who resigned 
astrauskas 59 had served as the republics president since 
december 1987 he was regarded by lithuanian activists as a 
conservative but not a vehement opponent of the independence drive 
there was no discussion at the supreme soviet of how many people 
the voting restrictions would affect and the soviet union does not 
publicize the number of military personnel stationed in its 
republics 
lithuanian progressives feared their favored candidates would 
not fare as well as they could if the servicemen were allowed to 
vote but the national government has struck down similar attempts 
to restrict voting rights in other republics

a strong earthquake shook eastern taiwan 
today but there were no immediate reports of casualties or serious 
damage 
the quake which measured a preliminary 58 on the richter scale 
of ground motion struck at 842 pm the central weather bureau 
said the epicenter was about 20 miles north of hualien a city in 
eastern taiwan 75 south of taipei 
the quake was felt in taipei where residents reported that it 
shook furniture 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake registering 6 on the scale can cause severe damage 
in a populated area

columbias astronauts settled into a 
day of medical and science experiments today after their sleep was 
interrupted by an alarm signaling a brief problem with a navigation 
system 
the five phantom signals that triggered the buzzing alarm posed 
no threat to the mission and the five crew members went back to 
bed after waking at the normal time commander dan brandenstein 
successfully tested the system and brought it back on line 
mission control reported the fleeting signals were in a 
speedmeasuring accelerometer that is part of whats known as an 
inertial measurement unit a key component of the shuttles 
guidance system 
when the alarm sounded in the cabin as the astronauts slept 
brandenstein woke up and asked the control center if there were 
anything he could do 
controllers told him the spaceship computer had shifted 
automatically to a second imu that everything was ok and to go 
back to sleep 
there are three such devices aboard only one is needed for a 
safe flight but flight rules dictate that if one failed mission 
control would consider bringing the astronauts home as soon as 
possible because of the possibility of a common problem in all 
three units 
when the astronauts were wakened at the regular time two hours 
after the alarm they were told that scientists on the ground had 
monitored the suspect unit and had detected no further problems 
brandenstein was told to put it back in operation and realign it by 
aiming at two stars 
the crew successfully did some celestial navigation said 
mission control commentator brian welch we just got word that 
all looks good imus 1 2 and 3 are all chugging along in good 
shape 
flight director al pennington said that five transient signals 
were received in a 10minute program each indicating either a lack 
of acceleration or a minus acceleration 
the problem may not be with the accelerometer but with one of 
the systems that transmits the data to mission control pennington 
said specialists were attempting to find out what went wrong he 
said 
weather over north africa was clear today and the astronauts 
snapped pictures of lake chad the nile valley and fires in kenya 
for an imax film called planet earth which will document 
damage that man and nature are doing to the planet 
they also probed and poked one another with medical instruments 
seeking information on how the human body adapts over time to space 
weightlessness 
officials earlier had reported that if columbia had to come home 
early weather could pose a problem at the primary landing site at 
edwards air force base calif and a secondary site at white sands 
space harbor nm 
but pennington said a new forecast calls for good weather both 
days at both places he also said the weather was good today over 
the runway at the kennedy space center launch site at cape 
canaveral 
mission control said the weather for fridays planned landing at 
edwards looked good a nighttime touchdown is scheduled for 259 
am pst 
the wakeup music today was the university of washington fight 
song one of the crew members mission specialist bonnie dunbar is 
a washington graduate 
good morning for your second wakeup of the morning the 
control center said referring to the earlier alarm 
brandenstein dunbar pilot jim wetherbee and mission 
specialists marsha ivins and david low are devoting the final days 
of the flight to experiments after accomplishing their main goals 
during the first half of the mission 
they deployed a navy communications satellite on the second day 
and on the fourth day they snagged an errant 11ton science 
laboratory and stowed it in the cargo bay for return to earth 
one experiment that suffered a mishap on friday was restored to 
health on sunday it involves melting and resolidifying a metal 
indium to determine how the material reacts to the process in 
weightless space

czechoslovakia began talks today 
with the soviet union on the withdrawal of about 75000 soviet 
troops and one source said czechoslovak officials want at least 
half of the force out by may 
on the eve of the talks about 6000 people protested in the 
town of pohorany demanding the entire soviet force leave by aug 
21 the 22nd anniversary of the sovietled invasion that crushed 
the prague spring reforms 
foreign ministry spokesman lubos dobrovsky said last week that 
the soviet forces should leave czechoslovakia by the end of the 
year 
the idea is to have them soviets make a political commitment 
during these talks that all the troops will leave by the end of the 
year the source said on condition of anonymity 
the rough idea of the time frame on the czechoslovak side is 
to see a 50 to 60 percent withdrawal by midmay the source said 
adding the talks should focus on technical details of the pullout 
as well as its precise timing 
no details emerged from the talks led by deputy foreign 
minister evzen vacek and his soviet counterpart ivan aboimov 
the source said demands for the complete withdrawal before aug 
21 were technically out of the question 
he noted it took a year to withdraw 5300 soldiers 708 tanks 
and 200 planes from czechoslovakia in 1989 as part of a kremlin 
move to withdraw about 50000 troops from eastern europe

police and national guard units 
stopped and searched vehicles today and have arrested 1200 people 
as part of a crackdown on street crime authorities said 
president carlos andres perez ordered about 5000 police and 
national guard troops on the streets of caracas earlier this month 
after the slaying of luis federico carbonnell a university of 
massachusetts professor who was visiting relatives 
three men and a woman have been arrested and charged with the 
slaying which police said came in an attempt to steal his car in a 
middleclass neighborhood 
the slaying prompted perez to announce a restructuring of police 
forces and step up the patrols but several people today doubted 
whether the effort would end violence that is tied to economic 
problems 
what theyre trying to do is avoid another riot said luis 
emiro alvarez a teenager who said hed been stopped by police 
asking him for identification 
in february riots broke out following price increases in food 
and public transportation claimed 300 lives and thousands injured 
police and national guard units today concentrated on major 
thoroughfares and stopped cars and buses instead of dispersing into 
the outlying slums where most crime takes place 
about 1200 prisoners were taken into custody over the weekend 
national guard spokesmen said 
the majority of the prisoners were young men guilty of illegal 
weapons possesion drug smuggling and lack of proper documentation 
said luis garcia morales national guard lieutenant 
nobody can deny that we have restored tranquility to 
caracas he said pay attention because this could be one of 
the few nights caracas has no crimes and no criminals

manuel antonio noriega panamas former 
military strongman was heavily involved in international 
gunrunning working both sides of the political street according 
to senate investigators 
at one point pilots flying weapons for noriega to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua are said by witnesses to have flown on to the 
united states with a cargo of narcotics 
noriega who controlled panama security apparatus was well 
positioned to engaged in the gray market arms business 
according to the 1988 report of the senate foreign relations 
committee on narcotics headed by sen john kerry dmass 
even before the death of gen omar torrijos then panamas 
ruling figure in a mysterious 1981 plane crash noriega had the 
authority to issue certificates to legitimize the shipment of 
foreign arms to panama 
once in panama noriega would sell the weapons to whomever bid 
the most for them the committee said citing the testimony of 
jose blandon a former panamanian intelligence official and 
onetime noriega adviser 
blandon told the subcommittee that noriegas earliest clients in 
the late 1970s included the sandinista rebels in nicaragua who 
were successfully battling to oust that countrys dictator 
anastasio somoza 
noriegas associates purchased the weapons in europe brought 
them to panama and then moved them into neighboring costa rica for 
shipment to the sandinistas 
quoting blandon the report said that those buying guns for 
noriega included michael harari a retired agent of the israeli 
intelligence service mossad 
harari who traveled to israel immediately after us troops 
invaded panama last month has been described as one of noreigas 
closest advisers a description he rejects as false 
the senate panel reported that although noriega sold many 
weapons to the sandinistas many more wound up in storage when 
the sandinista war ended in 1979 
floyd carlton a former noriega pilot testified that the excess 
weapons were then marketed by panama to the rebels in el 
salvador 
carlton said he and his partner cesar rodriguez flew the 
weapons to el salvador in 1980 using panamanian military aircraft 
on one trip the plane rodriguez was flying was damaged on 
takeoff and crashed when it attempted to land in el salvador 
carlton flying a second panamanian plane on the same 
weaponsdelivery mission said he pulled rodriguez from the 
aircraft put him on his plane and flew to panama where they both 
went into hiding 
when salvadoran officials discovered the wreckage of the 
panamanian defense forces plane the origin of the weapons was 
obvious the panel said 
noriega seeking to expand his arms business used his contacts 
with his military intelligence counterparts in latin america to 
find and develop weapons markets which he could supply 
profitably the panel said 
in an apparent disregard for the ideology of his customers one 
such market became the contra rebels in nicaragua battling the 
nowruling leftist sandinistas the panel said 
but the arms transfers to the contras had a doubleedged thrust 
according to participants 
many of the panamanian pilots carried mixed cargos of guns and 
drugs the committee was told 
when they reached costa rica they unloaded the weapons and flew 
onto the united states with the narcotics a witness werner lotz 
told the panel

campeau corp owner of bloomingdales and 
many other famous american department stores today placed them 
under bankruptcy court protection allowing the debtswamped chains 
to operate while attempting to work out their troubles 
the decision to file for chapter 11 protection was made late 
sunday by the boards of campeau and its federated department stores 
inc and allied stores corp subsidiaries which operate 260 stores 
in the united states including richs jordan marsh and lazarus as 
well as bloomingdales 
it is the biggest chapter 11 filing in american retailing 
history and reflects campeaus inability to pay off 8 billion in 
debt much of it acquired when the canadian parent acquired the two 
us subsidiaries in the mid1980s 
the filing followed weeks of speculation in the retail trade 
over how campeau would deal with the problems of operating its 
chains while continuing to pay suppliers 
the decision to seek chapter 11 relief was based on a 
conclusion that action was required at this time in order to 
preserve the operations strength and assets of the two department 
store companies while the corporate debt is restructured campeau 
said in a news release 
campeau said the filing was made in the us bankruptcy court 
for the southern district of ohio in cincinnati federated and 
allied are based in cincinnati 
carol sanger a cincinnatibased spokeswoman for campeau said 
us bankruptcy judge j vincent aug hadnt issued any orders about 
appointment of trustees or set court hearings the court opened 
briefly on the martin luther king holiday to receive the campeau 
filing 
under a chapter 11 filing the companies get a reprieve from 
creditor bills and can continue operations while reorganizing their 
finances but all decisions regarding the companies must be 
approved by a bankruptcy judge 
sanger said federated and allied would notify suppliers today of 
the filing 
torontobased campeau which also owns commercial real estate 
and shopping malls in the united states stated that all of its 
us stores would remain open and the company expected all customer 
services such as credit card purchases and merchandise returns to 
continue normally 
one of the chains lazarus ran fullpage ads in cincinnati and 
columbus newspapers today saying it was conducting business as 
usual 
maria kaldis a clerk at a downtown columbus lazarus said 
employees learned about the bankruptcy filing early this morning 
this wont affect the employees at all she said thats 
something that doesnt involve us its business as usual 
in addition to the chapter 11 filing the companies announced 
today they had negotiated further bank financing to cover their 
current cash needs 
federated said it had an agreement in principle with a bank 
syndicate led by citibank for 400 million in financing while 
allied had a similar agreeement from chemical bank for 300 
million both are subject to agreement by the syndicates and 
approval by the bankruptcy court 
a number of analysts have said a chapter 11 filing could benefit 
federated and allied by reassuring suppliers they would get paid 
if they continued shipping merchandise to the troubled stores 
suppliers who ship merchandise to the stores after the chapter 
11 filing would take precedence over many other creditors in 
getting paid 
on sunday campeau had announced it won a fiveday reprieve from 
a group of banks for a deadline today for deciding whether the 
company was in default on a 234 billion loan arrangement 
the banks lead by citibank earlier granted a twoweek 
extension for the troubled torontobased company to prove that it 
was able to repay the loan 
one analyst said the bank move appeared to be in reaction to a 
decision by campeaus board of directors thursday to split the us 
retailing units from the parent company and place them under 
independent trustees and directors 
under the restructuring announced thursday company founder 
robert campeau lost control of the retailing operations he will 
continue to run campeau corps real estate and development 
interests which are based in toronto 
also last week campeau made a 100 million payment for 
merchandise shipped to its stores between thanksgiving and 
christmas there had been speculation that the company could not 
make the payment on schedule 
observers said campeau apparently wanted to keep good relations 
with its suppliers so they would ship spring merchandise a decline 
in sales at the stores due to a merchandise shortage could make the 
stores less valuable should they be sold to raise cash or as part 
of a bankruptcy reorganization 
in a joint statement john w burden iii chairman and chief 
executive f federated and allied and james m zimmerman president 
and chief operating officer of the companies said they expected 
the chapter 11 filing to have a positive effect on their businesses 
by allowing the retailers to concentrate on sales rather than their 
financial problems 
at the same time under chapter 11 protection corporate 
management will have the necessary time to aggressively address the 
problems that exist at the corporate level with the burdensome 
capital structure that precipitated todays actions 
campeau already has put bloomingdales up for sale as part of 
its broad restructuring attempt burden and zimmerman stated the 
company would continue receiving bids for bloomingdales as part of 
the chapter 11 proceedings 
allied owns the jordan marsh the bon marche maas brothers and 
sterns department stores in addition to bloomingdales federated 
runs the burdines lazarus abraham amp straus and richs chains 
campeau also owns ralphs a southern california supermarket 
chain spun off from federated the business was unaffected by the 
filings

tens of thousands of people today stormed the 
headquarters of east germanys hated secret police and a 
prosecutor said he will indict former communist leader erich 
honecker for high treason 
the charge which also will be sought against the former head of 
the secret police carries a minimum penalty of 10 years in prison 
and a maximum of death in exceptionally grave cases 
the situation at secret police headquarters had gotten out of 
control state television reported the reports forced a hasty 
suspension of talks between the government and the opposition 
we are the people we are the people the protesters shouted 
as they stormed the building the official news agency adn said 
tens of thousands invaded the building while staterun television 
spoke of 100000 people 
witnesses saw the protesters going through the offices 
overturning furniture and scattering documents several people went 
into a store room carrying away wine battles of ketchup and other 
items 
protesters used stones and bricks to break through glass doors 
to get into the building according to witnesses adn reported that 
some people were throwing furniture through office windows 
the communistdominated government has reluctantly agreed to 
disband the secret police following massive protests from east 
germans 
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph told officials at the 
governmentopposition talks that honecker and former national 
security chief erich mielke are being investigated for 
anticonstitutional association and high treason 
joseph did not say when a formal indictment was expected 
although one is virtually certain under east germanys criminal 
justice system once an investigation begins 
honecker and mielke already had been under investigation for 
corruption and abuse of power honecker was removed as communist 
party leader on oct 18 he later was thrown out of the party and 
at one point was under house arrest at a luxury residential complex 
that had been reserved for party leaders 
mielke headed the secret police which has become a target of 
bitter criticism since the communists were forced to share power in 
east germanys peaceful revolution 
communist premier hans modrow today promised to publicize 
details of how the secret police force is being dismantled and he 
appealed for an end to strikes 
modrow made the comments at talks between the communistled 
government and an increasingly restive opposition he had said he 
would not attend the talks but changed his mind apparently bowing 
to opposition pressure 
manfred sauer a government official helping to oversee the 
dismantling of the secret police told the talks that there had 
been 85000 fulltime secret police agents and 109000 informants 
that means that up until a few months ago one out of every 80 
people in this country of 163 million worked for or routinely 
cooperated with the secret police 
modrow also promised that all available data and acts 
regarding the dissolution of the secret police will be made 
public 
he had planned to replace the secret police known as stasi 
with a new force but the opposition bitterly fought the plan and 
modrow abandoned it on friday 
he said a new security force was needed to counter the threat of 
growing neonazi activity but the opposition said that threat was 
greatly exaggerated and that a new security agency should be 
created after the election by a democratically elected government 
modrow initially rejected opposition demands that he attend 
todays session of the talks but he changed his mind after facing 
criticism from prodemocracy groups over the weekend 
he appealed for understanding and calm and called on 
representatives of the 16 political parties and groups present to 
cooperate in solving the nations troubles those troubles are 
compounded by the emigration of more than 1800 people a day to 
west germany 
public life must not be disturbed by strikes modrow said 
during the session broadcast live on television 
in recent days workers have staged warning strikes in various 
cities including erfurt and east berlin to pressure the 
communists to share more power and abolish the hated secret police 
modrow said he also would attend next mondays session of the 
talks apparently in an effort to counter opposition allegations he 
was not taking the negotations seriously 
an east german television commentator called modrows appearance 
a clever move aimed at defusing the growing challenges to his 
shaky coalition government 
there have been doubts as to whether modrows coalition can 
survive until the democratic elections scheduled for may 6 he 
bowed to previous opposition pressure last week by scrapping plans 
to form a new secret police agency 
markus meckel a leader of the influential social democratic 
party praised modrows appearance and said the premiers statement 
provided the basis to ensure the governments work and 
competence until the elections 
the social democrats over the weekend called for german 
unfication and promised to open talks with west germany if they win 
the may elections 
east germans demanding curbs on communist power kept pressure on 
modrows government sunday with more protests 
several hundred thousand people in several cities attended 
ceremonies commemorating the 1919 murders of two heroes of the 
german left 
in another development east germans began paying higher prices 
for childrens clothing and related articles and finance minister 
uta nickel said apartment rents also were likely to increase 
ms nickel did not give specific figures in her interview with 
the labor federation newspaper tribuene but said the government 
intends to move ahead with dismantling massive government subsidies 
and the israeli newspaper maariv and army radio reported that 
israeli and east german officials plan to meet in the next few days 
to discuss establishing diplomatic relations 
officials at the israeli foreign ministry said they were 
checking the report east german officials were not immediately 
available for comment

sen david durenberger conceding in advance 
some of the evidence looks bad will face the senate ethics 
committee early next month to give his side of real estate and book 
promotion deals the panel has been investigating 
in the meantime he has been apologizing and explaining lapses 
in judgement to the voters back home where he won reelection 
barely a year ago 
the minnesota republican is tentatively set to appear before the 
ethics committee feb 8 while it is still conducting a grand 
jurytype investigation to determine if there is substantial 
credible evidence that he broke senate rules the date was 
confirmed by senate sources insisting on anonymity 
saying he was ignoring his attorneys objections durenberger 
broke a yearlong silence on the case in late december 
he held a series of news conferences to apologize to fellow 
minnesotans told a homestate newspaper that unreleased statements 
on his book deal appeared to back allegations against him and 
blamed his trusted friends for sloppy legal work that caused 
some of his problems 
then he stopped talking again 
durenberger has confirmed the ethics committee is investigating 
whether 100000 he earned in 198586 to promote two books 
should have been counted as speaking fees exceeding senate limits 
on such honoraria outside income 
whether it was proper to use special interest groups to 
underwrite dual purpose trips to boston where he met with a 
marriage counselor and also held sessions with the organizations 
that paid his way 
whether he was right to charge the senate rent when staying in 
a minneapolis condominium he partly owned 
in his minnesota news conferences durenberger spoke in personal 
terms saying his ethics problems began after he separated from his 
wife sought out a harvard educatormarriage counselor and had to 
deal with paying for his four sons education 
in retrospect it is clear that i made mistakes and had lapses 
in judgment on these matters he said i am deeply sorry 
last week durenberger told the st paul pioneer press dispatch 
that he read a summary of witness statements on the book promotion 
prepared by his attorney but not made public 
he said of the promotion it appears to be an effort to get 
around the honoraria limits because im out there speaking to the 
same groups i might be speaking to for honoraria 
some people allege that they didnt know that i was speaking 
pursuant to a relationship with a publisher they thought i was 
responding to a request to give an honorarium speech 
durenbergers voluntary comments about such damaging statements 
prompted one senate source insisting on anonymity to comment 
whose side is he on 
the senators spokeswoman carrie collins now says durenberger 
will no longer comment on anything the ethics committee is doing 
durenberger is not the only senator under investigation by the 
committee also under scrutiny are sens john mccain of arizona 
alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr of michigan 
deconcini of arizona and former astronaut john glenn of ohio for 
their contacts in the case of a troubled savings and loan and 
alfonse m damato of new york in connection with housing deals 
but the minnesotans case has reached the furthest stage of any 
inquiry since the panel recommended the expulsion of former sen 
harrison a williams jr in 1982 williams who had been convicted 
in the abscam political bribery cases resigned as his colleagues 
were about to vote his ouster 
after durenberger appears before the committee the panel must 
decide whether to issue a statement of possible violations similar 
to an indictment 
such a finding would trigger an investigation akin to a trial in 
which the committee would decide whether an actual rules violation 
occurred if one or more violations were found the committee could 
recommend disciplinary action to the full senate 
punishment under committee rules could include recommendation of 
expulsion censure or a lesser penalty usually colleagues would 
consider expulsion only in extreme cases such as a felony 
conviction 
in the book deal durenberger in 198586 made at least 40 
speaking appearances under a contract with his publisher with the 
fees to be split between the two 
its now evident that the distinction between promotional 
appearances and honoraria speeches became unclear durenberger 
said books were not always available or on display at 
promotional speeches and some audiences have now said they were 
confused by the distinction 
beginning in july 1985 durenberger said he began seeing his 
boston area marriage counselor but used the trips to seek out 
opportunities to meet with special interest groups that paid his 
way 
durenberger said he now believes the situation occurred too 
frequently and that he let his personal needs weigh too heavily 
on the timing and location of meetings i was properly conducting as 
a senator 
the senator said his lawyers and tax advisers told him he could 
transfer his minneapolis condominium to a partnership pay rent to 
the partnership and use the senates per diem travel allowance to 
defray the cost of the rent 
i should have recognized that using my senate travel allowance 
to pay rent to a partnership in which i had any kind of interest 
would be viewed as improper said durenberger who no longer owns

goal of abolishing apartheid and establishing a democratic

people he said referring to anc president oliver tambo who is

weeks

conservative and a tough negotiator has been named by china as its 
next official representative to hong kong 
zhou currently vice foreign minister was appointed director of 
the hong kong branch of the official xinhua news agency chinas de 
facto ambassador to the british colony xinhua reported monday 
he replaces xu jiatun 74 a popular figure who has served in 
the post since 1983 
a western political analyst in hong kong had said that zhous 
expected appointment may signal a hardening of beijings attitude 
toward hong kong 
since chinas use of military force to suppress prodemocracy 
protests in june 1989 the beijing government has accused britain 
of allowing what it says are anticommunist political activities in 
hong kong 
it also has criticized moves to quicken the pace of democratic 
reform in hong kong and blasted the british government for plans to 
grant residence permits to 50000 hong kong families as an escape 
valve in case china does not live up to its promise to allow hong 
kong to keep its capitalist system after it reverts to chinese rule 
in 1997 
zhou was chinas main negotiator when hong kong gov sir david 
wilson visited last week for talks that apparently made little 
headway in resolving differences between the two sides

has served overseas in pakistan tanzania and at the united 
nations and has worked as vice minister since 1984

eight former high government officials asked 
president bush on monday to write to nelson mandela the jailed 
south african black freedom leader whom american officials are not 
permitted to see as a step toward nudging both sides in south 
africa toward negotiations 
for bush to contact mandela could well contribute to his 
release and return to political life the exofficials said 
their call for a us role as a broker in the dispute between 
south africas black majority and its white government was issued 
under the auspices of the foreign policy institute 
affiliated with the johns hopkins school of advanced 
interntional studies the institute seeks consensus positions that 
can be endorsed by former officials representing a range of 
political philosophies 
the south african statement was signed by harold brown former 
secretary of defense william t coleman jr former transportation 
secretary barbara jordan former democratic congresswoman from 
texas melvin laird former defense secretary edmund muskie 
former secretary of state herman nickel the reagan 
administrations ambassador to south africa and former republican 
senators charles mcc mathias of maryland and charles percy of 
illinois 
the former officials praised bush for meeting with 
antiapartheid clerics and black leaders from south africa but 
said the time had come for the united states to go further and 
engage the leaders of the south african government and its leading 
black antagonist the african national congress which mandela 
heads 
by word and deed the president must communicate to people at 
home and abroad that he shares the deep concern of all americans 
about the racial injustice of the apartheid system and its 
destructive impact on the entire region and that he has an active 
agenda to deal with it the statement said 
there need not be an american solution to south africas 
problems the exofficials said but the united states can help 
break the logjam that has blocked negotiations 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii should engage 
all the major players in a dialogue on what is needed and what 
each is prepared to do to get to the bargaining table and to keep 
talks from collapsing they said 
as part of a policy of using both inducements and pressures on 
the white government of president f w deklerk the exofficials 
said the united states should be willing to reconsider its support 
of a freeze that has prevented south africa from making loans from 
the international monetary fund 
they called additionally for the creation by congress of a 
national foundation for a democratic south africa whose 
appropriated funds would be matched by private contributions it 
would use the money to help black south africans realize their 
individual and collective potential and to build a nonracial 
democratic society 
us firms that have pulled out of south africa would be able to 
contribute their blocked south african currency accounts to the 
foundation and get us tax credits in exchange

the bush administration is getting ready to 
offer a new enticement to encourage americans to be more thrifty 
hoping to boost the countrys low savings rate 
president bush will ask congress to create a new family 
savings account that would allow people to earn taxfree interest 
and dividends on money that is squirreled away for a specified 
number of years administration officials said 
these officials who spoke on condition that their names not be 
used said the savings accounts would be part of the presidents 
1991 budget due to be released on jan 29 and would also be 
featured in bushs state of the union address to congress on jan 
31 
the administration is touting the proposal as a key to 
bolstering the countrys lagging international economic fortunes 
by increasing the pool of money available for investment and thus 
lowering the costs american businesses must pay to expand and 
modernize 
however many private economists remain skeptical saying while 
the proposal would be a popular taxbreak for the middle class it 
would do little to boost overall savings 
our past experience shows that these accounts dont do very 
much good in boosting savings said david wyss an economist with 
drimcgraw hill a private economic consulting firm the people 
who will take advantage of them would have saved anyway 
officials said that the bush proposal is still being finetuned 
but they gave the following details of what the final plan is 
expected to look like 
it will allow families to contribute as much as 5000 per year 
and individuals to contribute as much as 2500 annually the 
accounts would be limited to families with incomes below 120000 a 
year and to individuals making below 60000 annually 
unlike individual retirement accounts taxpayers would not be 
able to deduct their annual contributions from their taxable 
income but the interest and dividends would accumulate taxfree 
at the end of the required holding period the accumulated savings 
could be withdrawn and spent without any tax bite from uncle sam 
sources said the administration was still mulling how long a 
period to require seven years was mentioned as the most likely 
choice although there was some sentiment for a longer period 
possibly 10 years 
the holding period whether seven or 10 years would be a 
radical departure from iras which require that the investment be 
held until the taxpayer turns 59 if the money is withdrawn before 
that time a 10 percent penalty is imposed 
the new account has been promoted within the administration by 
treasury secretary nicholas brady whose department has been 
studying ways to boost americas competitive standing noting that 
americans managed to save only 44 percent of their aftertax 
income in 1988 just onefourth of the japanese savings rate 
this is a straightforward effort to try to change behavior 
said sidney jones assistant treasury secretary for tax policy 
it is a very simple concept very understandable and very 
forthright 
the administrations plan once it is unveiled will compete for 
support with a rival plan pushed by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the senate finance committee bentsens plan would 
expand the coverage of the current iras 
all workers were allowed fully deductible iras before passage of 
the 1986 tax overhaul that law made them available only to workers 
not covered by a company pension and to covered workers with 
incomes under 25000 and couples under 40000 partial deductions 
are allowed couples with incomes under 50000 and individuals with 
incomes under 35000 
bentsen and various private economists have questioned whether 
the administrations family savings accounts would do much to 
stimulate savings since taxpayers would receive no immediate 
benefit from their contributions unlike the ira 
critics say the administration chose a backended approach to 
supplying tax benefits in order to minimize the nearterm budgetary 
impact 
the administration hasnt got the nerve to propose the 
oldfashioned ira which would increase next years deficit so they 
are proposing to increase the deficit 10 years down the road

imprisoned nationalist leader 
nelson mandela favors retaining south africas free market economy 
after years of backing plans for a staterun economy according to 
news reports monday 
several johannesburg newspapers quoted leading black businessman 
richard maponya as saying mandela told him he was definitely 
inclined towards a free enterprise system rather than 
nationalization or state control of industries 
the two men who are close friends met recently at victor 
verster prison where mandela is being held the reports did not say 
when the two met 
mandela in the past has supported an economic program calling 
for the nationalization of mines banks and other key sectors of 
the economy as ways to advance majority rule 
the reports said mandela sees free market forces as the best way 
of providing for the needs of the nations rapidly expanding 
population 
the message mandela wanted me to take away from victor verster 
was his belief that the economy is the backbone of any nation 
maponya was quoted as saying 
he said he did not believe in nationalization because it was 
clear such a policy ran counter to the need to keep the south 
african economy growing to provide jobs maponya said 
mandela the nations most prominent black leader is expected 
to be released soon as part of the governments moves to abandon 
apartheid and negotiate with the countrys black majority mandela 
is allowed to receive visitors such as maponya and has held 
contacts with government officials 
the african national congress the main black power group to 
which mandela belongs still supports nationalization a change in 
mandelas position on the economy could lead to a serious division 
within the anc 
maponya said mandela was concerned that blacks be able to take 
part in the economy to counter the growing problems of mass 
unemployment poor housing and poverty 
he was concerned as to whether black people were getting 
themselves geared up to take up opportunities as they arose 
maponya was quoted as saying 
i told him of the training of quite a number of young 
entrepreneurs and he said this was a very good thing

azerbaijanis and armenians with submachine guns 
battled in one region of azerbaijan in ethnic clashes that have 
claimed at least 32 lives official media said today soviet 
officials declared a state of emergency in parts of the republic 
the kremlin flew reinforcements of internal security troops to 
azerbaijan to try to stop the bloodletting the worst between the 
two ethnic groups since their longsimmering feud in the caucasus 
boiled over nearly two years ago 
the soviet presidium led by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev declared a state of emergency in the nagornokarabakh 
region and several areas near it the scene of open armed conflict 
between gunmen of the feuding nationalities soviet tv announced 
tonight 
the text of the decree was to be published later but prime 
minister nikolai i ryzhkov earlier told a correspondent from the 
norwegian broadcasting company nrk that the kremlin was considering 
imposing a military administration and a curfew to stop the 
fighting 
he said the soviet army would be sent in if necessary to 
reinforce internal security troops already in the region who have 
been unable to halt the bloodshed 
staterun television said 300 azerbaijanis and armenians fought 
in the shaumyanovsk region of azerbaijan near the disputed region 
of ngornokarabakh it quoted a soldier as saying armenians fought 
back with hunting rifles and kalashnikov submachine guns when a 
group of azerbaijanis tried to set fire to an armenian farm 
attacks on the homes of armenians living in azerbaijan continue 
with more killings and six more bodies found the tv news program 
vremya said four of the dead were armenians and the others

the nations first elected black governor 
was applauded today by former colleagues as he addressed the 
states budget crunch by saying he would resist new taxes and 
deficit spending 
gov l douglas wilder went to work after a weekend of inaugural 
festivities delivering his state of the commonwealth message 
to the legislature in which he once served 
as one of the men we honor today dr martin luther king jr 
once observed the ultimate measure of a person is not where that 
person stands in moments of comfort and convenience but where he 
stands at times of challenge he said 
in his first speech to the general assembly wilder said he 
would not support a general obligation bond issue this year to deal 
with a projected 900 million revenue shortfall he also said that 
he would not support the repeal of a state sales tax on 
nonprescription drugs at this time even though hes supported it 
in the past because the state could not afford the loss of revenue 
although the day for this longawaited repeal shall come that 
day is not yet upon us he said 
he got a long and loud round of applause when he was introduced 
and his speech was interrupted by applause several times such as 
when he called on officials to resist tax increases and proposed 
drug testing and treatment for prison inmates 
earlier in an interview the governor said it certainly is 
ironic that he was starting work on the day honoring the civil 
rights leader 
wilder speaking on abcs good morning america said he 
fought for years as a state senator for a virginia holiday honoring 
the slain civil rights leader 
though the king birthday is a holiday for state employees it is 
not for the legislature 
on sunday wilder a guest on abcs this week with david 
brinkley was asked if a black could be elected president in 
our time 
yes if what you say is our time is the forseeable future 
yes i do think there is a possibility wilder said 
at his inauguration saturday before more than 35000 people 
outside the state capitol wilder said despite our economic 
slowdown we are living in the best of times and they can be even 
better and they will be better 
wilder the grandson of slaves also alluded to the history he 
made by being elected governor in the former capital of the 
confederacy 
we mark today not the victory of party or the accomplishments 
of an individual but the triumph of an idea he said the idea 
that all men are created equally 
wilder a democrat who turns 59 on wednesday took the oath of 
office from retired us supreme court justice lewis f powell jr 
a richmond native who headed the citys school board during the 
turmoil over integrating public schools 
wilders 15minute inaugural address was interrupted by cheers 
five times once when he proclaimed freedom is meaningless when a 
womans right to choose is regulated outside the dictates of her 
own faith and conscience 
wilders support of abortion rights was a prominent issue in his 
fiercely fought campaign against republican j marshall coleman 
who opposes abortion a recount showed that coleman lost by 6741 
votes or less than half a percent in the closest race for 
governor in the states history 
before the inauguration the rev jesse jackson and former 
tennis star arthur ashe joined wilder at a prayer service 
later muhammad ali was among the crowd of about 12500 at a 
soldout inaugural ball at the richmond coliseum tickets ranged 
from 50 to 7500 for some box seats 
the high costs prompted at least one protest sign in the 
inauguration crowd it read is there a ball for church hill 
a reference to the largely poor neighborhood in richmond where 
wilder grew up 
but most in the crowd said they were inspired by the historic 
inauguration 
the eyes of the nation are on virginia said mildred swann 
a social services worker in her 40s who recalled how she evaded 
the ku klu klan as she tried to get fellow blacks in mississippi to 
register to vote in the early 1960s 
for me to see something like this in my lifetime theres 
some hope for the world she said 
when wilder was introduced she bowed her head and cried

halewood in northwest england also launched an indefinite strike 
monday disrupting work ford said 
ford said the walkout forced it to lay off 1000 workers in the 
metal stamping and body plant at halewood 
we are extremely dismayed that bridgend employees have taken 
this strike action after we were assured by the trade union side 
that no industrial action would be taken at least until wednesdays 
talks a company spokesman 
the walkouts follow the union leaders rejection last wednesday 
of fords offer of a twoyear deal with a 102 percent increase in 
the first year and an increase of 75 percent or the inflation 
rate plus 25 percent in the second year 
ford employs 32000 workers at 22 british plants it said the

redoubt volcano fussed and fumed quietly 
monday and scientists planned to install new seismic sensors on 
the peaks flanks the alaska volcano observatory reported 
late sunday the 10197foot volcano 115 miles southwest of 
anchorage was emitting a steam plume to about 14500 feet said 
geologist c dan miller the plume contains little or no ash and 
seismic activity in and beneath the volcano remained low he said 
he said the observatory planned to put three crews on and near 
the mountain monday 
one was to install two seismic sensors on the volcanos flanks 
the second was to survey sections of the drift river valley to look 
at past mud flows to determine flooding hazards 
a terminal for cook inlet oil is located at the mouth of the 
drift river 
redoubt has caused flooding in the drift river several times 
since it started erupting in middecember federal scientists have 
warned the state that redoubt could cause a flood big enough to 
carry large blocks of ice and rock crashing into oil storage tanks 
or wash out a buried oil pipeline 
the third crew plans to investigate deposits left by eruptions 
on jan 2 and jan 8 miller said

a teenage mother jailed with her baby in a 
shoplifting case will be freed a court ruled monday reversing a 
sentence imposed by a judge who said he wanted to deter women from 
getting pregnant to avoid prison 
tracey scott a 19yearold unmarried supermarket cashier was 
convicted for letting friends walk out of the supermarket with 
goods they did not pay for she pleaded guilty to 10 charges of 
theft and was sentenced by northern circuit judge james pickles to 
six months in jail 
she went to prison two weeks ago with her daughter alesha then 
10 weeks old a sentence that caused an uproar in britain 
coming from pickles known nationwide for his quirky sentences 
the punishment was not entirely a surprise however 
in june he drew controversy for jailing a witness who was too 
frightened to testify against a man accused of beating her up 
the day after putting ms scott in prison pickles let off two 
of the supermarket thieves with a sentence of 50 hours community 
service apiece 
what should have been a routine shoplifting case has generated 
editorials angry letters to newspapers discussion on radio 
callin shows and debate in parliament 
lord mackay of clashfern the highest legal official signaled 
his concern by immediately reviewing the case file members of 
parliament have voiced dismay with the opposition labor partys 
barry sheerman demanding that mackay review pickles entire record 
by making a lottery of the law judge pickles treats the 
public with contempt he must not be allowed to continue said 
the tabloid newspaper today 
the times of london said that judge pickles decision again 
needs questioning in this case 
pickles maintained in his verdict that while he didnt suspect 
ms scott of getting pregnant to avoid going to prison he was 
afraid other women might get that idea 
would it be right he asked to let young women know that 
one way of possibly or probably avoiding custody would be to 
deliberately become pregnant between the time they have been 
detected committing a crime and the time they were being 
sentenced 
lord lane the lord chief justice clearly thought not 
presiding at mondays court of appeals hearing he said pickles 
reasoning had left a most unfortunate impression 
the offense was not serious enough to warrant imprisonment lane 
said a high school dropout from a broken home ms scott had been 
a good worker at the supermarket in huddersfield northern england 
and acted only to win popularity he said 
pickles the judge said seems to us to have been concerned 
more with the public import of what he was doing and saying rather 
than the justice of it 
ms scott is in styal womens prison in cheshire and will have 
a hearing in london on tuesday when she will be formally released 
pickles a judge since 1976 has flouted regulations by 
discussing his actions in the news media frequently with a blunt 
populist tone 
i dont like the notion of aristocracy or even monarchy i 
dont accept anyone is different from me because they were born in 
a different bed he told the sunday times in march 
last week he vigorously defended the sentence for ms scott 
telling a tv interviewer a judge decides whats right whats 
just and whats fair giving full reasons on both sides and if 
hes wrong hes wrong 
pickles 64 insists he is humane he twice delayed sentencing 
ms scott until he was sure a place was available for her and the 
baby in youth custody where the regime is less strict 
he has called for relaxing prostitution and drug laws saying 
they encourage crime in january he freed on probation a man who 
had molested a 6yearold girl pickles said the man would have 
been picked on by bullies in prison and that the arrest and court 
appearance likely would have a chastening effect 
when he imprisoned michelle renshaw for seven days for contempt 
of court over her refusal to testify against her attacker several 
lawmakers demanded his resignation 
pickles believes strongly in deterrent sentencing when he 
realized no reporters were covering that sentencing he had one 
summoned over the court public address system

foreign minister roland dumas convening a meeting 
monday on cambodia called on the five permanent members of the 
un security council to make sure the khmer rouge never returns to 
power 
senior officials of the united states the soviet union china 
britain and china met for two days of talks expected to focus on an 
australian plan calling for a un force to take over cambodias 
administration until free elections can be held 
none of the warring factions have objected to the australian 
proposal which could become the basis for direct peace 
negotiations said indonesian foreign minister ali alatas alatas 
spoke in thailand on monday after completing meetings with the 
leaders of vietnam the communist government of cambodia and the 
guerrilla factions 
the french foreign ministry said dumas told the paris meeting 
that the five permanent security council members have particular 
responsibilities for maintaining peace and some have important 
influence on the protagonists in cambodia 
china is the chief supplier of the communist khmer rouge the 
united states backs the noncommunist rebels and the soviet union 
supports the vietnameseinstalled government of premier hun sen 
dumas said the meeting should seek by all means a solution to 
allow an end to the murderous conflict tearing apart cambodia that 
prevents a return to power by the khmer rouge the statement 
reported 
no report on the meetings progress was expected before tuesday 
evening after the representatives of the five countries meet again 
with dumas at the end of their discussions 
participating in the meeting are deputy foreign minister igor 
rogachev of the soviet union us assistant secretary of state 
richard solomon chinese vice minister xu dunxin british deputy 
foreign minister david gillmore and the director for asia in 
frances foreign ministry claude martin 
after a visit to beijing last week rogachev said the soviet 
union and china agreed the united nations should play a very 
major role in a settlement raising hopes that china would 
pressure the khmer rouge to accept such a deal 
pressure for finding a settlement to the 11yearold conflict 
has been building with reports of khmer rouge advances in western 
cambodia 
the khmer rouge army radio claimed monday that many thousands of 
people were fleeing battambang cambodias secondlargest city 
after guerrilla attacks on government positions 
the report could not be confirmed and western diplomats say the 
khmer rouge often exaggerates the success of its attacks 
khmer rouge forces also detonated plastic explosives in the 
capital phnom penh on june 56 they also said they had forced 
the cambodian leadership to flee to vietnam a claim the government 
denied 
a peace conference on cambodia last summer broke down over 
proposals for a fourparty interim government that would include 
pol pots khmer rouge which was responsible for hundreds of 
thousands of deaths during its 3year rule 
vietnam chased the khmer rouge from power when it invaded in 
late 1978 
hun sen a former khmer rouge guerrilla refused to consider 
khmer rouge participation prince norodom sihanouk leader of the 
threeparty resistance coalition insisted on including them 
saying they would continue the war if kept out 
since vietnam said it withdrew it last troops in september 
pressure has been growing on the united states britain and france 
to switch at least some of their support from sihanouk to hun sen 
as the best means of preventing the khmer rouge from again gaining 
power

the hearty panamanian welcome for the 
us invaders surprised intellectuals and university students who 
are trying to figure out whether they belong to a nation or a 
glorified american colony 
our generation does not believe in anything anymore said 
ivonne bruneau a student at the university of panama 
the intellectual and political community is also trying to 
figure out where the nationalist spirit went wrong 
nationalism was identified with support for a government 
the regime of gen manuel antonio noriega said raul leis an 
independent sociologist and political scientist 
it was like someone grabbing a clean flag with dirty hands if 
you were a nationalist you had to support noriega if you were 
democratic it meant you opposed noriega and were not nationalist 
eventually we tended to identify democratic with the united 
states which opposed noriega leis said 
the us soldiers who invaded dec 20 to oust noriega were 
cheered and embraced by panamanian civilians some of whom offered 
them food and invited them to their homes for new years eve 
go ahead and touch him one mother told her young son 
pointing to a us soldier in battle gear its like your gi joe 
doll 
this is a honeymoon said sociologist marco gandasegui 
director of the center for latin american studies but like all 
honeymoons it will end 
ms bruneau said the americans did something we could not do 
or were not prepared to do to my generation it was a good change 
after more than 20 years of military government 
the united states is often referred to as panamas midwife 
president theodore roosevelt engineered its separation from 
colombia in 1903 and in return obtained concessions that resulted 
in construction of the panama canal 
until 1977 the united states had sovereign control over the 
canal zone a 10milewide strip of land along the canal that 
divided the country in two 
panamas national currency is the us dollar nearly 35000 
americans live here and until july more than 10000 soldiers and 
their dependents lived off base in panama city 
there has been a process of assimilation of panama into us 
culture said cecilio simmons dean of the school of public 
administration and member of the democratic revolutionary party 
that was created by noriegas mentor former dictator omar torrijos 
there are sectors of the populations that would like to become 
a protectorate of the united states our oligarchy is closely tied 
economically to us interests our professionals are attracted by 
the socalled american way of life 
then there are our own mistakes the corruption of the 
previous regime that twisted the meaning of nationalism he 
added 
nationalists struggled for decades to rid the country of the 
canal zone where they were treated as foreigners in their own 
land the process culminated with the signing of the panama canal 
treaties under which the canal becomes panamanian on dec 31 1999 
noriega represented that strain of nationalism but corrupted it 
and grew weaker each day in may elections current president 
guillermo endara beat noriegas candidate by a 31 margin 
those who oppose the invasion are almost embarrassed that 
noriegas defense forces so vocal in their pledges to fight to 
the death surrendered so easily there were no casualties among 
the higher officers 
leaders of many nationalist parties have gone into hiding and 
are not making statements about the invasion 
they are too concerned about their dollar accounts being 
frozen if they say something said one university professor 
bitterly 
nevertheless the first public sign of discontent came jan 9 a 
holiday called day of the martyrs it commemorates panamanians who 
died in antius riots in 1964 
while 8000 gathered at a mass to celebrate the overthrow of 
noriega and his surrender to us authorities to face drug charges 
150 people staged a protest march to a cemetery where some of the 
martyrs are buried they said they did not support noriega but 
they also did not support intervention 
the appeal of economic aid to a country in a severe financial 
crisis was also a factor in the favorable reaction according to 
some panamanians 
the fact that endaras government was installed by a us 
invasion has not hurt him yet but eventually may become a 
liability 
the united states will have to help considerably to maintain 
the support of the people and help this government that has no 
experience at all said another university student luis botello 
if the promised help does not come through the us image will 
suffer 
the time will come when the us presence will begin to bother 
people ms bruneau said

the domed canadian the famous scenic train on 
one of the worlds longest rail lines headed west monday on its 
last journey as part of large reductions in passenger service 
nationwide 
the transcontinental daily run was among 17 of 38 lines on the 
via rail passenger system that were eliminated after lastminute 
court challenges failed 
chris holloway director of transport 2000 canada a federation 
that lobbies for improved transportation said the cutbacks were 
devastating 
its an emasculation of the service he said 
the reduction of about 50 percent in passenger train service was 
announced in october as part of prime minister brian mulroneys 
effort to trim the federal budget deficit 
the government will reduce annual subsidies to via rail from 
550 million in 1988 to 301 million by 1992 the reduced service 
took effect monday and the train system laid off 2761 of its 
employees or about 38 percent of its workforce 
holloway in an interview from ottawa said the government was 
wrong in contending that not enough canadians ride the trains to 
justify continuing the subsidies at current levels 
thats balderdash thats simply not true he said no 
national rail passenger service operates without a deficit 
about 450 protesters chanting save the trains gathered 
sunday at torontos union station for the departure of the 
canadian which will complete its last 2700mile trip wednesday 
when it arrives in vancouver british columbia 
hundreds more participated in demonstrations in at least 10 
other towns and cities and the last passenger train run from 
sydney in nova scotia to halifax was canceled because protesters 
padlocked themselves to the locomotive 
the elimination of the canadian line touched off an emotional 
debate that recalled the routes critical role in forging the 
canadian confederation in the 19th century 
i think its wrong its going to hurt national unity 
julia conley 64 told protesters at union station in a voice 
quavering with emotion 
two people were killed sunday when the canadian collided with a 
pickup truck at a crossing in a residential area near pembroke 
ontario about 60 miles west of ottawa police said the train 
resumed its run a short time later 
its quite a way to end it all said conductor don green 
who is retiring after 34 years i havent seen something like 
this in 15 or 20 years 
the canadian has operated daily on a southern route that dated 
more than a century and often includes the spectacular scenery of 
the canadian rockies and prairies the route is featured on 
countless posters and postcards 
a parallel northern route called the supercontinental was 
reduced from daily service to three times a week via rail will 
rename that train the canadian although the route is considered 
far less scenic than its counterpart 
the via rail cuts also affect a couple of regional routes eight 
remote ones and a major chunk of service along the populous 
montrealtoronto corridor that extends to quebec city and windsor 
ontario

rescue crews monday recovered a 
ferry that sank with at least 150 people on board and found 16 
bodies in the hull the government said news reports said the 
final death toll may exceed 100 
the ajmeri a singledeck wooden ferry capsized sunday after 
colliding with another vessel on a river near the town of 
munshiganj 20 miles southeast of dhaka 
the ferry had a licensed capacity of 60 passengers but the 
governmentowned bangladesh times said the vessel carried 300 
people the independent ittefaq newspaper put the number at 150 
ittefaq said at least 50 people riding on the ferrys roof swam 
to safety but that about 40 suffered injuries 
police divers called off the search for bodies at dusk monday 
but hundreds of relatives of the missing thronged the river banks 
have you seen my husband asked ranu ali a middleaged 
woman speaking to rescue workers he was on the ferry 
when told her husband ahmed ali was not among the survivors 
she began sobbing 
local government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said divers would resume the search at dawn tuesday but one 
official said river currents had probably carried most of the 
bodies away and that he doubted more would be found 
the ajmeri sank in 50 feet of water at the confluence of the 
dhaleswari and shitalkhya two of the hundreds of rivers that 
crisscross the country 
shipping minister korbal ali told parliament the ferry was 
brought to the surface about 15 hours after it capsized 
only 16 bodies have been found so far in the hull ali said 
he did not say how many people were aboard the ferry when it sank 
or whether the death toll was expected to rise 
river ferries are an important means of transport in bangladesh 
and crowding on the vessels has been compounded recently because a 
transport strike has halted bus services

television news pays a lot of attention to 
members of congress who run for president but ignores most of the 
rest of them a study says 
for example democratic rep richard gephardt rated a few 
mentions on the evening news for his congressional work on the 
federal tax code including a hotly debated bill that bore his 
name but it took his bid for the presidency in 1988 to make his 
face and name familiar on tv 
likewise sens albert gore jr lloyd bentsen paul simon and 
dan quayle found that mention on the three networks cbs nbc and 
abc was the result of their political aspirations rather than the 
nutsandbolts doings in congress 
as an everyday member of congress they might not ever be 
mentioned said the man behind the study joe s foote a former 
congressional staffer and now chairman of the radiotelevision 
department at southern illinois university in carbondale 
in 198788 the study found that 10 percent of the members of 
the senate accounted for nearly 50 percent of all network senate 
coverage less than 3 percent of the membership in the house made 
up about 90 percent of the network house coverage during the same 
twoyear period 
quayle was not far from nevermentioned status as the junior 
senator from indiana in the 198586 session he got just six 
mentions on the nightly news 
but that number skyrocketed to 172 in 198788 the congressional 
session that included his election as vice president quayle wasnt 
a formal candidate until george bush made him one but the pattern 
was the same among democratic presidential hopefuls 
gephardt of missouri an unsuccessful democratic presidential 
candidate in 1988 was mentioned 25 times during 99th congress of 
198586 during the 100th congress he totaled 253 mentions 
meaning use of his name in a report a film clip or an interview 
gore of tennessee rose from 27 mentions in 198586 to 209 in 
198788 
simon of illinois rated 15 mentions in 198586 but 200 in 
198788 
sen joseph biden of delaware was mentioned 35 times in 
198586 then 104 in 198788 
foote based his study on the television news index and abstracts 
at the vanderbilt university news archive in nashville tenn 
which tracked mentions on the evening news programs of the three 
networks cable news network was not included 
the senator mentioned most often on network television news was 
bob dole of kansas who not only ran strongly against bush for the 
republican presidential nomination but was his partys leader in 
the senate already well known he had 276 mentions in 198586 
then 486 in 198788 
gore ranked second in the 100th congress with 209 mentions 
simon was third with 200 and bentsen of texas the 1988 democratic 
vice presidential candidate was fourth with 199 during 198586 
bentsen had managed just 14 mentions 
in this arena at least bentsen edged out quayle who was fifth 
among senators with his 172 mentions in 198788 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the armed services 
committee was sixth with 155 mentions and sen robert byrd 
dwva senate majority leader at the time was seventh with 144 
mentions 
at the bottom of the list with no mentions from 1987 to 1988 
were sens quentin burdick dnd wendell ford dky and harry 
reid dnev 
gephardt led the list of house members with 253 mentions former 
house speaker jim wright dtexas was second with 196 and jack 
kemp the former new york congressman who was thwarted in his bid 
for the gop presidential nomination was third with 193 mentions 
rep lee hamilton dind cochairman of the congressional 
irancontra committees received 89 mentions in 198788 rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the armed services committee was fifth 
with 59 mentions 
during that period 44 percent of the house members were never 
even mentioned on the nightly news programs 
as the 1980s passed by congressional backbenchers found it 
was harder and harder to break into the national spotlight as 
defined by abc cbs and nbc foote said 
the result is that some of the newer and younger members of 
congress have fewer and fewer opportunities to influence public 
opinion foote said we rarely hear their ideas

parliament voted unanimously monday to 
abolish the communist partys monopoly on power opening the way to 
free elections and it reaffirmed the abolition of harsh 
restrictions on the ethnic turkish minority 
national assembly deputies agreed to remove constitutional 
clauses as other soviet bloc countries have done that for 40 
years enshrined the party as the guiding force in society and the 
state 
foreign minister boyko dimitrov told reporters if was a first 
step but a very important symbolic step you shouldnt move 
forward toward democracy by banning other parties 
alexander dimitrov a deputy said in the debate we should 
not forget that there is no socialist and no bourgeois democracy 
there is either democracy or there isnt 
fledgling opposition groups loosely allied in what they call 
the union of democratic forces were to begin negotiations with the 
communists on tuesday about further reforms and the elections 
tentatively scheduled for may 
about 200 people shouting down with the communists 
demonstrated outside parliament on monday supporting opposition 
demands for their own offices and a newspaper petar beron an 
opposition spokesman insisted the demands be settled before the 
negotiations started 
more than 50000 people held a rally in freezing temperatures 
sunday to press opposition demands for twostage legislative 
elections that would give noncommunists a chance to organize 
they also called for removal of a constitutional clause defining 
bulgaria as a socialist state headed by the working class 
parliament postponed action on those demands andrei lukanov 
said a special committee should be named to draft changes in that 
and about 25 other constitutional articles by the end of february 
such amendments are needed to hold free elections but lukanov 
said adoption of a new constitution should be left to the new 
parliament he is second in the leadership to petar mladenov who 
became president and party chief after stalinist leader todor 
zhivkovs downfall in november 
lukanov said he favored removing the reference to the leadership 
of the working class because no class should be privileged he also 
said however that the party has popular support and bulgaria 
should remain communist 
as a parliament we cant decide such a fundamental question 
on the basis of a onehour debate he said only the people 
can decide this in a referendum 
under mladenov and lukanov the communists clearly hope to use 
their long dominance to preserve the standing lost by their 
comrades in poland hungary east germany czechoslovakia and 
romania 
like other east europeans we want democracy without some 
kind of preconditions lukanov said but added we believe in 
socialism despite some deformations we will fight for that 
and think its our historic task to do so 
opposition was crushed or strictly controlled by zhivkov who 
was forced out nov 10 after 35 years in power 
in debate monday deputies stridently condemned the zhivkov 
years and calmly voted to overturn the oneparty rule that provided 
their own power and privilege 
a deputy who did not identify himself declared if the working 
class really had that leading role it would never have permitted 
our prisons and camps to be crowded by thousands of peasants our 
brothers and fathers 
mikhail genovsky an elderly member of the bulgarian agrarian 
party the only other political party zhivkov permitted said 
the blood that has been shed we cannot forget 
todor zhivkov said we could have only 120000 members he 
said we had to ask local communist party officials for 
permission for every new member 
on the ethnic question parliament approved a declaration 
adopted by a broad forum of communists opposition and ethnic 
leaders last week supporting the decision to restore language 
religious and educational rights to the 12 million ethnic turks 
most of whom are moslems 
many bulgarian nationalists opposed a decision by the leadership 
dec 29 to restore the rights abolished in 1985 after an 
assimilation campaign that forced ethnic turks to take bulgarian 
names 
last weeks compromise endorsed the decision but also said 
bulgarian is the official language in this nation of we oarian is 
the official language and affirmed bulgarias territorial 
integrity 
parliament gave approval in principle monday to amnesty for 
about 8500 prisoners including two dozen ethnic turks jailed for 
defending their minority rights 
it would be the third amnesty since zhivkov fell vasil 
mrachkov the former prosecutorgeneral told the deputies 60 
ethnic turks were included in the first two

community leaders and banking officials unveiled a 
1 billion plan monday to increase the availabilty of loans 
mortgages and construction funds to minority communities across the 
state 
the massachusetts bankers association is a permanent working 
relationship that will have a profound impact on this city and this 
states ability to grow and develop said boston city councilor 
bruce bolling 
studies by the federal reserve found that more mortgages were 
issued in white boston neighborhoods than in black ones 
the plan follows nine months of negotiation between bankers and 
representatives of minority neighborhoods in boston and the states 
other major cities 
what we discovered in the process was that there was an awful 
lot we bankers didnt know about the reality of the inner city 
said richard pollard chairman of the mba and baybank boston and 
what the community leaders realized was that there was a lot they 
didnt realize about the reality of banking 
the program will include a loan consortium to finance affordable 
housing developments create a financing pool for small business 
and economic development in lowincome minority neighborhoods and 
increase bank investment in minority neighborhoods 
willie jones head of the community investment coalition said 
the banks could have glossed over bias in lending institutions by 
simply throwing money at the problem he credited them with instead 
establishing a program that could help lowincome families for the 
next two decades 
we have the confidence that the banks are stepping to the mark 
to address the problems facing our community he said 
the mba said half of its plan will be financed by banks based in 
boston and that eventually 100 banks will participate specific 
commitments were to be unveiled later in the week 
the statewide plan will not include a pool of money for 
mortgages at interest rates below going market rates boston 
bankers agreed to provide 30 million for such mortgages in the 
city 
the plan includes 
a 100 million loan program for affordable housing development 
a 100 million mortgage program for neighborhoods targeted for 
revitalization 
establishment of the massachusetts bankers minority enterprise

gov l douglas wilder called for fiscal 
conservatism monday in his first state of the commonwealth 
speech as the nations first black governor 
wilder delivered the speech on martin luther king day to the 
legislature he once served and from which he pushed for the state 
holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader the state faces a 
900 million deficit for 199092 
wilder who was sworn in saturday said his cautious approach to 
dealing with an economic slowdown brought to mind the words of king 
as one of the men we honor today once observed the 
ultimate measure of a person is not where that person stands in 
moments of comfort and convenience but where he stands at times of 
challenge wilder told the states general assembly 
wilder urged the general assembly to resist tax increases and 
promised to trim the state budget enough to establish a reserve 
fund he said he would not seek a sales tax exemption on 
nonprescription drugs a measure he has long favored and would 
not support use of general obligation bonds for state projects this 
year 
on social issues wilder said he would convene conferences on 
rural development and the drug problem he called for drug testing 
and treatment for prison inmates and supported the death penalty 
for drugrelated murders 
wilders 24minute speech which was interrupted by applause 
nine times drew generally favorable reviews from the 
democraticcontrolled general assembly 
some of the conservatives in this state should be turning 
backflips over this speech said house majority leader thomas w 
moss jr of norfolk 
its the best republican speech ive ever heard spoken by a 
democrat said sen joseph b benedetti a richmond republican 
wilder did not give a specific figure for his proposed reserve 
fund and did not say where he would find the money as the general 
assembly wrestles with a projected 900 million revenue shortfall 
in the 199092 budget 
wilder told reporters after the speech that he would present his 
proposed budget amendments by friday 
a biennial budget is a budget for two years not for one 
wilder told lawmakers and i think the time has come for us to 
practice that in fact as well as in theory 
twice during the 1980s wilder said the state ended a fiscal 
year with no reserve for appropriation in the second year of the 
biennium he said the 258 billion twoyear budget proposed by 
former gov gerald l baliles falls 200 million short of providing 
enough money for salary increases for teachers and state employees 
in the second year 
wilder drew applause early in his speech when he relayed his 
first principle of fiscal discipline we should resist the urge 
to enact general tax increases

youve seen the commercials the ones showing 
pastoral scenes of waves fields and forest with a mans soothing 
voice asking existential questions about eternity and values 
although no car is ever seen most viewers know its a 
commercial for the japanese luxury car infiniti except in new 
england where not all is as it appears 
a series of advertisements that ran from christmas eve to jan 2 
parodying the infiniti spots has had new englanders talking 
laughing and watching 
questions what are we for why am i here asks a voice 
narrating one of the parodic spots as the camera fixes on a still 
forest scene the voice continues especially when oldsmobile is 
having a great sale right now 
the camera cuts to a plug from an oldsmobile spokesman a few 
shots of cars and the theme song this is not your fathers 
oldsmobile used in olds national advertising 
when the scene returns to the forest the voice asks what is 
a factorytodealer incentive anyway it trails off wondering 
how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could 
chuck 
the commercials mimic the infiniti spots almost exactly even 
the voice that of a professional sounds like the copywriter who 
laid down the track for infiniti 
somebody had to do it said ron lawner executive vice 
president creative director at the boston office of the new 
yorkbased della femina mcnameewcrs inc where the commercials 
were made lawner said many people called his office commending the 
series which advertised an oldsmobile holiday sale for a regional 
dealers association 
the nature of the content was supposed to be provoking to get 
them talked about when everybody is having the same sale lawner 
said 
to the makers of the infiniti ad imitation is the best form of 
flattery 
i think its a terrific parody they did a terrific job of 
playing around with our ad said chuck kushell executive vice 
president general manager at hill holliday connors cosmopulos 
inc advertising in los angeles where the infiniti ads were made 
sidney zussman president of the new england oldsmobile dealers 
and owner of west street motors in methuen said his group loved 
the ads 
people came in the door saying i saw your ad and its the

jesse jackson declaring that statehood for 
the district of columbia was a mainstream issue launched a new 
effort monday to gain the districts admittance to the union 
dc statehood is a mainstream issue jackson said we 
need to go to work mobilizing people all over the country we 
want democracy and not tyranny 
jackson said the campaign which began on the national holiday 
honoring slain civil rights leader martin luther king would give 
substance to the dream that king espoused 
jackson who moved to the district last year was joined at the 
opening of the rainbow coalitions dc statehood office by local 
and national politicans local labor leaders and mayoral hopeful 
sharon pratt dixon 
the campaign will focus on persuading those who voted for 
jackson in the 1988 democratic presidential primaries to rally 
behind the statehood effort the twotime presidential hopeful said 
roughly 7 million voters backed jackson in the primaries 
the civil rights leader said he has already met with senate 
majority leader george mitchell and house speaker thomas s foley 
to push the statehood issue he said statehood supporters will 
write to each member of congress and senator by feb 1 to determine 
who supports the idea 
the republican and democratic parties will also be asked to 
help and jackson expressed confidence that he will be able to meet 
with president bush to discuss the statehood issue 
surely if he can send our men and women to fight and die for 
democracy in panama he will not deny democracy where he lives 
jackson said if mr bush can stand for puerto rican statehood 
surely he can stand for dc statehood too 
in his state of the union address last january bush promised to 
have party officials explore the possibility of making puerto rico 
a state 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown a former 
jackson aide and dc resident noted that statehood for the 
nations capital was a plank in the 1988 democratic platform 
well be behind it said brown we will be putting our 
resources behind this mostly organizational help 
jackson has been rumored as a possible mayoral candidate but 
has publicly said he would not oppose mayor marion barry in the 
upcoming election 
barry indicated he may include funds for two shadow senators 
and a shadow representative in the budget he will send to the 
city council next month those elected to the largely ceremonial 
nonvoting positions would lobby for statehood in congress 
the district currently has one nonvoting delegate to the house 
of representatives

central heart of any company he graced 
her husband and costar john alderton said gordon was the 
sweetest gentlest man i have ever met all those millions 
worldwide who loved his work will feel his loss no less than those 
who had the great good fortune to have known him

underconfident and im too tentative im not a gogetter and i

roll that i dont enjoy this business

prime minister yitzhak shamir said monday that 
israel must keep the occupied west bank and gaza strip the heart 
of the middle east conflict to settle jewish emigres from the 
soviet union 
his suggestion renewed the countrys debate over trading land 
for peace and raised fears among palestinians 
up to 300000 soviet jews are expected to move to israel over 
the next three years 
for a large immigration we need the land of israel a large 
and strong israel shamir said we will need a lot of place to 
absorb everybody 
the statement made sunday night before a group of oldtimers 
from shamirs rightwing likud bloc in tel aviv was broadcast 
monday on israel radio 
likud members and other hardliners use the term land of 
israel in references to the jewish state and the occupied 
territories which israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 middle east war 
hardliners view the west bank and the gaza strip as an integral 
part of the nation and have recently begun suggesting that 
territories serve as homes for soviet immigrants they have long 
argued that israel keep the lands for biblical and security reasons 
shamir came under immediate attack from the leftleaning labor 
party his partner in israels coalition government and an advocate 
of trading some of the occupied land for peace 
i do believe that a great israel is an israel that lives in 
peace not in conflict said finance minister shimon peres 
leader of labor party a great immigration needs a great israel 
and to have a great immigration we need an israel that has the 
greatness of peace 
now about 70000 jewish settlers live amid about 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
palestinians have waged a 25month revolt against israeli rule 
in the occupied territories and have demanded an independent 
homeland 
palestinian analysts say part of the anxiety stems from 
potential competition for jobs held by about 120000 palestinians 
in israel 
im afraid that were not only talking about jobs but about 
taking over our lands resources palestinian activist saeb 
erekat said in an interview the immigrants will be taking over 
the future of the palestinians and not only their jobs 
calls for settling soviet immigrants in the occupied territories 
also have raised tensions with foreign fundraisers and the us 
administration which has repeatedly said that jewish settlements 
in the occupied lands are an obstacle to peace 
israel expects about 50000 soviet jews this year and officials 
predict up to 300000 could arrive over the next three years 
they are seeking at least 350 million in donations from 
american jews to help cover the costs of settling immigrants and 
have asked the us government to guarantee 500 million in housing 
loans 
the jerusalem post reported monday that israel may also ask for 
a onetime us government grant of 500 million for resettlement 
in addition to the annual 3 billion in us military and economic 
aid 
the white house had said it would not assist any resettlement 
projects in the west bank and gaza and the quasigovernmental 
jewish agency an institution that helps handle new arrivals says 
it will not funnel jewish donations to the occupied lands 
last year about 12000 soviet jews immigrated to israel 
joining 250000 soviets who have settled in israel since the late 
1960s 
settlement activists say 380 immigrant families moved to the 
occupied lands in 1989 and their goal is to settle 500 more new 
families mostly soviet immigrants this year

thirdlargest school system monday promising to make it a national 
model of public education 
ted kimbrough assumes control of a system that has a 
doubledigit dropout rate low standarized test scores and what 
some critics say are bureaucrats fighting a reform effort aimed at 
improving it much is expected of him 
at a ceremony for winners of a student essay contest honoring 
martin luther king jr kimbrough declined to outline an agenda 
but said he is committed to working with a key element of the 
reform 540 councils made up of parents teachers and principals 
that were elected in october with the power to hire and fire 
principals spend money and develop school improvement plans 
but he said for the councils to work they must must be 
resourceful and act on their own and if they dont then i dont 
think reform will work 
despite the warning he said public education here in chicago 
probably will set a model for public education in the rest of 
the country 
kimbrough also faces low employee moral at the school board 
where hundreds of positions are being eliminated in a bid to 
decentralize the bureaucracy a possible 51 million deficit in the 
199091 budget and an interim board that will be replaced in may by 
a new 15member board must also be dealt with 
kimbrough a 54yearold a chicago native was named

ron brown chairman of the democratic national 
committee told an audience of blacks and jews monday that they 
must ensure their relationship does not deteriorate despite honest 
differences 
differences that can anger and even enrage cannot be allowed 
to divide us brown told an observance at the israeli embassy of 
martin luther kings birthday we must realize that the 
differences between our communities are not recognized by david 
duke and the ku klux klan that race hatred and religious 
persecution walk handinhand he said 
duke is a former klan leader serving in the lousiana 
legislature he has ties to neonazi groups and is president of the 
national association for the advancement of white people 
brown the first black to be elected to the democratic partys 
chairmanship was the featured speaker at the fifth commemorative 
observance held at the embassy 
he said that just as king took his message outside his church 
and into the streets we must leave behind this gathering of 
elites and carry a message to those in our communities who are not 
here the poor and disaffected the uneducated the prejudiced and 
the angry people who search for targets and scapegoats 
that message is this it is not jews that have bombed and 
threatened civil rights leaders and it is not blacks who are 
painting swastikas on synagogues brown said we do not 
threaten one another 
he recalled for the audience that jews and blacks stood 
together for justice sat at lunch counters rode in buses across 
the south marked on washington picketed organized and voted 
together 
twothirds of the whites who went to mississippi for freedom 
summer twothirds of those students who put their lives on the 
line twothirds were jewish said brown 
moshe arad the israel ambassador to the united states said 
there was a unique bond between kings deep faith and ardent 
commitment and the dteachings and values of judaism 
perhaps that is why so many jews flocked to his banner and 
enlisted in his cause and supported his movement arad said 
we in israel no less than the jews of america have long 
cherished dr king the ambassador said

itself valjas said 
valjas refused to comment on recent secessionist trends in 
lithuania and said lithuanian leaders should answer such questions 
later in a speech to finlands leading foreign policy forum 
the paasikivi society valjas said his party would have to 
realize itself as a parliamentary party 
if it wants to retain its influential position in society it 
must be actively involved in the democratic developments and in 
carrying out perestroika valjas said 
he criticized soviet economic leaders for wrong methods of 
leadership and ignoring market economy laws 
the negative developments are continuing work is inefficient 
and financial difficulties are increasing the crisis phenomena

officials of the ceausescu regime 
members of the dictators family and officers of the security 
police will be charged with genocide murder and undermining the 
economy the government said monday 
previously it has said accusations that they committed and 
abetted such crimes were being investigated but not that charges 
would be filed 
dictator nicolae ceausescu who ruled romania for 24 years and 
put many members of his family in powerful positions was 
overthrown dec 22 by a popular uprising supported by the army he 
and his wife elena the second most powerful person in the country 
were executed three days later 
chief prosecutor gheorghe robu said monday investigations had 
been slowed in part because major problems arose in the writing 
of statements since many of the exofficials can hardly write 
even though a good part of them held a doctorate in science 
the ruling national salvation front which took over after 
ceausescu fell also said monday it would make the final choice of 
a date for free elections after consulting with all opposition 
parties 
opposition groups have urged that elections planned for april 
be delayed so they can have more time to organize 
dragos munteanu a spokesman for the front told a news 
conference monday he believed parliamentary elections should be 
held as soon as possible but added that a delay was possible 
among those scheduled for trial this week is ceausescus playboy 
son nicu who was communist party boss of sibiu a city in 
transylvania robu said in an interview carried by the official 
news agency rompress 
no dates or locations were given for any of the trials 
the genocide charge refers to those romanians killed by 
ceausescus special securitate police during the revolution and to 
victims of his regime undermining the economy relates to hardships 
caused by the decision to pay off the foreign debt of 11 billion 
from 1982 to last year at the cost of severe shortages at home 
amnesty was announced monday for crimes committed before the 
ceausescu was ousted it excluded former functionaries murderers 
rapists and terrorists which has become the common term for 
securitate members 
trials of 11 securitate members are to begin friday in 
timisoara where the revolution began a week before ceausescu was 
overthrown rompress said 
over the weekend police in timisoara said the trials would 
start monday there was no explanation of the delay 
munteanu the government spokesman told reporters the fact that 
the communist party was banned friday and made legal again saturday 
showed the need for quick elections 
he said the confusion was the result of inexperience and 
declared when i speak about learning democracy even the 
government has to learn it we dont have real statesmen and 
politicians they have to learn 
a referendum will be held jan 28 on whether to outlaw both the 
party and capital punishment which was abolished after the 
ceausescus were executed 
at his news conference munteanu defended dimitri mazilu vice 
president of the provisional government against opposition demands 
that he be removed because of alleged former connections with the 
securitate 
even if mazilu had been a securitate officer at the beginning of 
the ceausescu regime munteanu said conversions happen 
for the last five years he has been an outstanding spokesman 
against ceausescus regime he told the reporters 
visitors from the united states west germany and britain met 
with romanian officials monday 
rep chester g atkins a democrat from massachussetts said he 
would propose hearings on restoring most favored nation status to 
romania the trading advantage was granted because of ceausescus 
independent stance in the soviet bloc but withdrawn two years ago 
because of human rights violations

president bush took advantage of a holiday and 
mild temperatures to get in 18 holes of winter golf monday but the 
outing ended on a sour note 
bush got at least a quadruple bogey on the last hole 
secretary of state james a baker iii national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and fred zeder head of the overseas private 
investment corp joined the president on the 3hour tour around 
the andrews afb links 
on the par 4 18th hole bushs fourth shot landed in a bunker 
short of the green he blasted out of the sand trap sailing the 
ball over the green and up a hill where reporters were clustered 
oh a little downhill a little backspin downhill said the 
president 
all you do on a shot like this is keep your head down and 
plant your feet firmly said bush explaining his technique 
he swung hard and the ball jiggled forward about six inches 
on his second swing it sailed over the pin to the far edge of 
the green 
that says it all said bush marching off and picking up the 
ball without bothering to hole out he needed to sink a 15foot 
putt to escape with an 8 on the final hole 
dont use profanity do not pay off in front of the cameras 
bush advised zeder as they walked off the course within range of 
microphones and cameras 
but it was not zeder but bushs partner scowcroft who was 
doing the paying off pealing several bills out of his wallet and 
handing them to zeder before they left the course 
no one divulged the final tally 
bush spent most of the martin luther king jr holiday weekend at 
camp david the presidential retreat in the catoctin mountains of 
maryland before flying to andrews by helicopter to play golf under 
sunny skies and a temperature of 57 degrees as the sun set his 
marine one helicopter returned him to the white house

refuge in bankruptcy court for its us department stores monday 
keeping open famous chains such as bloomingdales lazarus and 
richs while struggling to reorganize 
the filing for chapter 11 protection in us bankruptcy court in 
cincinnati was the biggest ever by a retailing business affecting 
258 department stores that employ 100000 people and are visited by 
millions of consumers nationwide 
officials of campeaus federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp quickly sought to reassure customers employees 
and merchandise suppliers that business would go on as usual they 
said all regular customer services such as credit card sales and 
merchandise returns would continue as would payments to suppliers 
and employees 
the big problem is corporate not in the stores said anne 
berg a spokeswoman for federateds atlantabased richs chain i 
think the public will understand the problem is not with richs 
were solvent 
the filing reflected campeaus problems paying the 
multibilliondollar debt accumulated in acquiring allied in 1986 
and federated in 1988 two of the biggest retailing industry 
takeovers of the decade 
even before monday campeau was planning a restructring that 
would enable it to pay debts and was negotiating with creditor 
banks over billions of dollars in loans coming due 
under chapter 11 the companies get a reprieve from creditor 
bills and can continue operations while reorganizing their 
finances all business decisions regarding the companies must be 
approved by judge j vincent aug jr who took the case 
bankruptcy protection should benefit campeaus stores by 
allowing retailers to concentrate on sales rather than the parent 
companys financial difficulties john w burden iii chairman and 
chief executive of federated and allied and james m zimmerman 
president and chief operating officer of the companies said in a 
statement 
at the same time under chapter 11 protection corporate 
management will have the necessary time to aggressively address the 
problems that exist at the corporate level with the burdensome 
capital structure that precipitated todays actions the 
statement said 
federated and allied also announced monday that they had 
negotiated agreements in principle with bank syndicates for 
financing to cover cash needs including 400 million for federated 
and 300 million for allied both deals are subject to approval by 
the syndicates and by the court 
on new york citys upper east side bloomingdales trendy 
flagship store took the unusual step of opening 10 minutes late so 
employees could hear the announcement of the filing over store 
intercoms 
business otherwise appeared normal except for reporters 
interviewing customers outside the front door were trying to 
keep a lid on it said bloomingdales spokeswoman katie locke 
some campeau stores quickly put signs on merchandising floors or 
took out fullpage ads in local newspapers to reassure customers 
at federateds cincinnatibased lazarus store group which 
operates 43 stores in five states employees were told by letter 
that they would be paid on schedule and that the company would make 
good on any corporate checks workers had trouble getting cashed 
said lazarus chairman mark cohen 
cohen said he called suppliers monday to assure them the company 
intends to continue business as usual 
everyone i talked to has been positive and upbeat he told a 
news conference 
numerous suppliers contacted campeau monday and said they 
wanted to resume shipping merchandise as soon as possible to 
stores campeau spokeswoman carol sanger said in cincinnati she 
declined to identify the suppliers 
jockey international the hosiery underwear and sportswear 
maker issued a statement saying it wanted to continue supplying 
merchandise to the federatedallied stores mainly to avoid 
inconveniencing its own customers 
the decision to file for chapter 11 protection was made late 
sunday by the boards of campeau which is based in toronto and the 
cincinnatibased federated and allied units 
federated already was trying to sell the bloomingdales chain as 
part of a restructuring effort burden and zimmerman said the 
company would continue entertaining bids for bloomingdales 
cohen said the reorganization could take months or years 
analysts have said a chapter 11 filing could benefit federated 
and allied by reassuring suppliers they would get paid if they 
continued shipping merchandise suppliers would receive precedence 
over many other creditors 
on sunday campeau said it had won a fiveday reprieve from a 
group of banks on a monday deadline for deciding whether the 
company was in default on a 234 billion loan arrangement the 
banks led by citibank earlier had granted a twoweek extension 
last thursday campeau announced a restructuring under which 
us retailing businesses will be separated from the parent company 
and run independently and in which company founder robert campeau 
was removed from involvment in retailing 
the bankruptcy court which was closed in observance of the 
martin luther king jr holiday opened at campeaus request to 
accept the chapter 11 filing then closed again the company said 
allied owns the jordan marsh the bon marche maas brothers and 
sterns department stores besides bloomingdales federated owns 
the burdines lazarus abraham amp straus and richs chains 
campeau also owns ralphs a los angelesbased southern 
california supermarket chain spun off from federated ralphs

the army killed civilians while hunting for dissidents who crossed 
into the nimba region from neighboring ivory coast in an attempt to 
overthrow president samuel k doe 
but he said the soldiers were acting in selfdefense against 
people in civilian clothes who attacked them 
doe who came to power in a violent 1980 coup said the rebels 
killed more than 200 unarmed civilians in the two weeks after they 
entered nimba on dec 24 before his forces brought the situation 
under control according to the liberian authorities about 16 
liberian officials were also killed after the rebels attacked the 
villages of butuo and karnplay near the border 
africa watch a washingtonbased human rights group said 
liberian soldiers killed at least 200 civilians after the attempted 
coup scott gave no figures on the number of civilians killed by 
the army 
amnesty international gave no exact figure on the number of 
civilian deaths by the rebels or military except to say hundreds 
had been killed 
it quoted refugees and other unofficial sources as reporting 
that the rebels destroyed villages and killed dozens of civilians 
once government forces retaliated it said the army burned 
villages and killed large numbers of unarmed civilians unconnected 
with the rebels 
the chief of butuo who fled to the ivory coast claimed that 
armed forces sent to recapture the village burned it down and shot 
to death the village commissioner david boley and his wife on 
dec 29 amnesty international said 
the chief who was not identified claimed he and the boleys 
were questioned about the rebels stripped and shot as they lay on 
the ground the rights group said the chief survived because he 
was left for dead 
amnesty international said as many as 20000 refugees had fled 
from nimba to the ivory coast and guinea ivorian president felix 
houphouetboigny said about 8000 to 10000 people had entered his 
country this month 
following a previous coup attempt in november 1985 amnesty 
international said hundreds of civilians were killed by government 
forces in the nimba region several opposition leaders including 
robert phillips were detained in monrovia 
phillips who was subsequently acquitted of assisting the coup 
attempt in a treason trial was one of several people murdered in 
recent weeks in monrovia apparently by unidentified men searching 
for rebels and suspected of being members of the security forces

amnesty international said monday security 
forces in hong kong have beaten vietnamese boat people and the 
british colonys government forced some to return home despite 
their genuine fear of persecution 
a report by the human rights group which is based in london 
urged the hong kong government to stop forcible return of 
vietnamese to their communist homeland 
the hong kong government called the report unfounded and said it 
was committed to the forced repatriation policy 
in london the foreign office said we reject these 
allegations we will not send any genuine refugees back any 
allegations of ill treatment will be fully investigated 
amnesty accused the hong kong government of mistreating the 
first 51 boat people forcibly returned who were sent back to 
vietnam in december 
it quoted witnesses as saying security forces dragged them from 
the chi ma wan detention center in a raid oct 31 using kicks 
beatings and choke holds 
hong kongs secretary of security geoffrey barnes said a 
minimum of necessary force was used on that occasion 
there is no truth whatsoever in the accusation that people at 
chi ma wan were illtreated or rendered unconscious he said 
the refugees were then taken to another detention center the 
phoenix house early dec 12 hundreds of security forces in riot 
gear brought them to the international airport 
during that operation reporters did not see any evidence of 
brutality 
the report also charged the government with stopping 
investigations of official misconduct in the camps citing two 
incidents when 200 boat people were allegedly beaten and kicked by 
security forces last year in one detention center it said unruly 
boat people are routinely locked in empty subdivided cargo 
containers for several days 
the report said many vietnamese feared that if they spoke up 
about abuses they faced possible retribution by the police and 
risked unfavorable treatment in the screening process 
amnesty international criticized the screening process to 
separate refugees with the right to find a new country from 
economic migrants who will be forced back to vietnam 
the fundamental rights of people who face a genuine risk of 
persecution are being violated the report said 
of the 40000 vietnamese awaiting screening an estimated 85 
percent face forced repatriation they make up the bulk of boat 
people who arrived after june 1988 when hong kong stopped 
automatically granting refugee status 
under the screening process boat people are given a hearing 
with an immigration officer they can appeal the decision once 
as of tuesday 7567 vietnamese had been refused refugee status 
and 1889 had lost appeals so far 997 have voluntarily returned 
to vietnam 
amnesty international said that during the screening process 
boat people receive no legal advice and are often interviewed by 
immigration officers with scant knowledge of the human rights 
situation in vietnam 
one case involved a young vietnamese who was refused refugee 
status even though he allegedly was fleeing a fiveyear term of 
political imprisonment in vietnam 
an emergency intervention of the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees provided the man refugee status 
however barnes defended the screening process saying hong kong 
has given the benefit of the doubt to many refugees 
but he said the colony would proceed with forced repatriation 
it would be wrong and cannot be humane to leave them in 
detention indefinitely he said 
vietnam has promised not to prosecute or mistreat the boat 
people for fleeing their homeland but the amnesty international 
report said it fears that local officials may persecute those who 
return

committee and officers of the regular police sealed off the 
headquarters after the protest ended 
also monday chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph said he 
planned treason indictments of erich honecker 77 the stalinist 
leader forced out three months ago and erich mielke 82 head of 
his secret police 
state television said the situation got out of control at 
the headquarters of the oncedreaded secret police agency adn the 
official news agency said several people brought bricks with 
them 
the democracy that is just now developing is in the gravest 
danger the television said in a warning repeated throughout the 
evening 
hans modrow the communist premier rushed to the building in 
east berlins lichtenberg section but was met with catcalls and 
whistles when he tried to address the crowd 
you were not elected by the people the crowd shouted when 
modrow called for restraint and warned against violence 
the rev rainer eppelmann an opposition leader said he 
regretted the violence but called the storming an alarm signal 
for the government 
adn said tens of thousands of people stormed the building 
television spoke of 100000 
official media said about 500000 east germans demonstrated 
against the communists and secret police in at least a dozen more 
cities 
about 150000 people staged a noisy anticommunist protest in 
the opposition hotbed of leipzig they also chanted germany 
united fatherland and dozens waved west german flags 
another 150000 rallied in karlmarxstadt and 150000 more 
took to the streets in dresden adn said 
protests were also reported in potsdam erfurt schwerin 
rostock halle cottbus neubrandenburg stralsund magdeburg and 
frankfurt an der oder 
in cottbus about 50 people broke from the main group of several 
thousand protesters and clashed with police guarding secret police 
headquarters there adn said the protesters threw stones and broke 
windows in the building before police dispersed them the agency 
said 
thousands of workers staged politically motivated warning 
strikes in east berlin gera jena and zwickau

people were working at the headquarters monday 
no one was reported hurt but the west german tv network zdf 
quoted unidentified east german officials as saying protesters 
threatened workers demonstrators smashed glass doors to enter 
the building witnesses said the new forum prodemocracy group had 
originally organized mondays protests and had repeatedly called 
for demonstrators to avoid violence 
the seventh weekly negotiating session between the communist 
party and opposition where the government official assigned to 
dissolve the agency had made a report was suspended after the 
attack 
the indictment of honecker and mielke would be the most drastic 
action to date against leaders of the disgraced regime that ruled 
for 18 years 
high treason carries a maximum penalty of death in 
exceptionally grave cases and a minimum of 10 years in prison 
the two are among 30 former leaders being investigated for 
corruption abuse of office and other serious offenses 
honecker is recovering from surgery for a malignant kidney tumor 
since his downfall east germans have demanded those guilty of 
abuses be punished 
modrow promised monday to open secret police files and give the 
opposition a greater consultative role in the government he 
appealed for an end to warning strikes 
manfred sauer the official assigned to dismantle the secret 
police dominated mondays meeting with the most comprehensive 
disclosure yet about the secret police 
he said one of every 80 east germans had worked for the agency 
or supplied it with information and that 3200 employees were 
assigned to tapping telephones and opening mail 
sauer said the state security apparatus cost about 2 billion to 
run last year about 13 percent of the national budget 
honecker expanded the secret police he said and by the end of 
the 1980s there were 85000 agents and 109000 steady informants in 
a country of 163 million people 
sauer told the meeting all directives against dissidents were 
stopped by the government on nov 29 
he said 30000 agents were fired new jobs would be found for 
22500 and 20000 would be dismissed within the shortest time 
possible he said those remaining would be needed to dismantle 
the agency

hundreds of azerbaijanis and armenians fought with 
submachine guns helicopters and armored vehicles as brutal ethnic 
strife that claimed at least 37 lives raged in the soviet caucasus 
official reports said monday 
facing the most violent flareup in the ethnic conflict since he 
became soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and the soviet presidium 
declared a state of emergency monday night in azerbaijans disputed 
nagornokarabakh region and in nearby areas of azerbaijan and the 
neighboring republic of armenia 
horrified tass reporters wrote people were burned alive 
overnight as attacks against armenians continued in baku 
azerbaijans capital again the blood of innoncent people was 
spilled they said 
monday nights decree means red army units and kgb troops now 
will be used to protect residents of the strifetorn area and vital 
installations like railroads the official tass news agency said 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov told norwegian radio earlier 
that army units would be sent if needed to keep the conflict from 
growing into civil war 
the kremlin sent highlevel troubleshooters and more internal 
security troops to the mountain region 1240 miles southeast of 
moscow to try to end the fighting it was the worst combat 
involving predominantly moslem azerbaijanis and the mostly 
christian armenians since their longsimmering territorial feud 
boiled over nearly two years ago 
tass said armenians and azerbaijanis with submachine guns were 
waging open armed clashes in azerbaijans khanlar region near 
nagornokarabakh in the nearby shaumyansky region 300 gunmen 
fought in a single battle soviet tv news said 
a soldier told the broadcast azerbaijanis attacked an armenian 
village to set a farm on fire but the armenians fought back with 
hunting rifles and assault rifles in a 1hour firefight four 
azerbaijanis were killed he said 
tass said nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian district of 
azerbaijan looks like a frontline zone today trenches are 
being dug in villages selfdefense posts being reinforced it 
said terrorists with hand grenades and machine guns were 
coverging on the azerbaijani village of adzhikend and that 
artillery guns used to break up hailstorms were brought in to shoot 
at helicopters 
the government newspaper izvestia said the belligerents were 
using helicopters without markings and armored vehicles captured 
from military bases 
the violence which exploded saturday night with an 
antiarmenian riot in the oilproducing center of baku is 
reminiscent of news from the warfront in world war ii soviet 
tv commentator igor kudrin said grimly 
izvestia said at least 33 people had died the past three days in 
antiarmenian rampages in baku a city of 17 million but that the 
figure could rise as other ransacked apartments were inspected 
attacks on the homes of armenians were continuing with more 
killings soviet tv said it said 34 people mostly armenians had 
been injured 
last night in baku was as horrible as the previous one tass 
special correspondents n demidov and v gondusov wrote from the 
city on the caspian sea once again the fires of pogroms burned 
again the blood of innocent people was spilled 
they said people presumably armenians had been burned alive in 
front of bakus railway station 
less than 20 yards from a police station like ugly black 
dolls two blackened bodies were cast on a trash heap the tass 
reporters said 
the azerbaijani communist party tried to issue condolences to 
relatives of riot victims but the kommunist printing works in baku 
wouldnt print them saying sympathy should also be expressed for 
azerbaijanis whose family members died at the hands of armenians 
according to interfax a news service of radio moscow 
two ferries evacuated about 660 armenians mostly women and 
children from baku across the caspian to krasnovodsk a city in 
the republic of turkmenia soviet tv said they were flown to 
yerevan armenias capital aboard two tupolev154 jetliners said 
karen shakhbazyan an armenian activist in the city 
about 20000 ethnic armenians most of them elderly live in 
baku although the ethnic violence the last two years has caused a 
return of azerbaijanis and armenians to their home republics 
armenia is in a state of battle readiness shakhbazyan 
reported from yerevan he said 200000 people rallied monday on 
theater square and that at least 100 armed police massed at the 
airport hoping to fly helicopters to azerbaijan to defend armenians 
there 
shakhbazyan said businesses in yerevan formed defense 
committees of volunteers in leninakan a city hit hard by the 
1988 earthquake 10 machine guns and 100 assault rifles were seized 
from an interior ministry troops detachment he said 
tass reported armenian fighters had taken hostages in the 
azerbaijani city of gyandzha and izvestia said unidentified people 
broke into an agricultural institute and grabbed 80 automatic 
weapons two machine guns a mortar and 27 bayonets kept for 
students military training 
in shaumyanovsk armenians including the entire communist party 
and government leadership were taken hostage soviet tv said 
the kremlin dispatched yevgeny m primakov a nonvoting member 
of the ruling politburo and chairman of one of the two chambers of 
the supreme soviet legislature to baku and nikolai n slyunkov a 
full politburo member to yerevan 
previous attempts by moscow including placing nagornokarabakh 
under its direct administration failed the mainly armenian 
enclave of 160000 people has been controlled by azerbaijan since 
1923 but now wants to be part of armenia 
the state of emergency declared monday also empowers local 
officials to ban demonstrations and strikes impose curfews censor 
the media confiscate weapons and disband unofficial organizations 
moscowbased correspondents were told monday by foreign ministry 
officials they would not be permitted to travel to azerbaijan or 
armenia 
reinforcements of interior ministry troops and combat 
helicopters carrying paratroopers were dispatched to azerbaijan 
sunday tass said it did not give figures 
troops arriving at the airport in kirovabad an azerbaijani city 
with a large armenian population could not move out because the 
road were blocked by civilians and hundreds of cars and trucks 
tass said 
in baku supplies to the troops are being sabotaged it said 
when convoys of security forces tried to move closer to the 
azerbaijani capital a signal rocket was fired by azerbaijani 
militants bringing crowds onto the road who blocked it until they 
were pushed aside tass said 
according to izvestia not a single railroad train reached 
armenia through azerbaijan monday as the rail blockade renewed last 
week by azerbaijan to press its demands for sovereignty over 
nagornokarabakh continued 
a total of 224 trains are immobilized on azerbaijani territory 
and 109 more have no locomotives to move them izvestia said 
armenia depends heavily on rail supplies via azerbaijan and 
shakhbazyan said fuel was running short in yerevan because of the 
blockade 
for the fifth straight day interfax said no freight cars 
carrying goods or fuel entered stepanakert the administrative 
center of nagornokarabakh 
since gorbachev became soviet leader in march 1985 his greater 
tolerance for dissent has encouraged many soviet ethnic groups to 
make demands they long suppressed that has often led to violent 
conflict in the nation of more than 100 nationalities many of whom 
harbor ageold grudges 
the last major rioting sparked by the nagornokarabakh feud was 
in february 1988 when azerbaijanis attacked armenians in sumgait 
near baku thirtytwo people died most of them armenians more 
than 200 have since been reported killed

protesters who tore up the secret police 
offices monday used the scornful nickname stasi for the agency they 
equate with the nazi gestapo and some toasted each other with 
champagne stolen from its storerooms 
stasi out and into the factories they chanted the people 
are here now 
stasi is a shortened form of staatssicherheit the agencys 
proper name which means state security in german 
tens of thousands of east germans stormed the building at about 
530 pm monday releasing pentup anger against the force that 
cracked down on dissent for four decades east german television 
said 100000 took part 
they ranged in age from teenagers to people in their 50s and 
some who appeared older 
some spraypainted slogans on the walls stasi gestapo kgb 
securitate bloodsuckers read one that associated the east 
german agency with its nazi soviet and romanian equivalents 
no injuries were reported and some raiders appeared in a nearly 
festive mood 
state television said the offices had virtually not been 
functioning any more because the agency was being disbanded how 
many employees were in the building was not known 
thousands roved through the building throwing furniture from 
windows and scattering documents grabbed from filing cabinets 
one group found a portrait of erich honecker the 77yearold 
stalinist who ran the country for 18 years until october they tore 
it off the wall and stomped on it 
at least one west german flag was seen being carried through the 
halls 
about 60 police were on the scene but did not interfere one 
smoked casually as he watched the mayhem 
honecker used the secret police to spy on citizens crack down 
on dissent and intimidate opponents of the communist government 
they had wide powers and sent thousands of political prisoners to 
jail 
dismantling of the agency has been a major opposition demand 
and the government says it is accomplishing the task 
the prodemocracy group new forum organized as protest of the 
secret police for monday but had urged demonstrators to avoid 
violence 
hans modrow the communist premier tried to address the 
protesters and finally managed to be heard despite loud whistling 
when he finished his appeal about an hour after trouble began the 
raiders began to disperse

monday he has offered to resign because of the assassination of the 
former defense minister last week in a lima parking lot 
governnment sources said president alan garcia who met sunday 
at government house with velasquez refused to accept the 
resignation 
the former minister enrique lopez albujar was the most 
prominent victim in perus 10yearold guerrilla war officials 
blame tuesdays slaying on shining path rebels who have brought 
their battle against the government from the andean highlands where 
they originated to the nations capital 
the procuban tupac amaru revolutionary movement also claimed 
responsibility for the slaying but counterinsurgency experts 
continue to believe the shining path is responsible because of the 
manner in which the assassination occurred 
lopez albujar was killed jan 9 when at least four leftist 
terrorists shot him with submachine guns and pistols as he arrived 
alone in his car at the office where he worked following his 
retirement last year from the armed forces 
he was alone because his driver and a bodyguard arrived late to 
work that day 
velasquez said he presented a letter of resignation friday to 
garcia because he considered himself politically responsible 
because it was his ministrys duty to insure lopez albujars safety 
official sources said that president garcia is not willing to 
accept the decision of the defense minister la republica 
newspaper reported earlier monday 
lopez albujar was army commander in 1987 when garcia named him 
as perus first defense minister a cabinet post created to 
consolidate authority over the three armed forces he retired in 
may and was replaced by velasquez 
garcia last week publicly criticized the failure to provide 
sufficent protection to lopez albujar but said people who could be 
terrorist targets should also take precautions 
more than 17000 people have died in perus political violence 
since the shining path launched its guerrilla war in may 1980 the

the closure of the only soviet facility 
capable of destroying chemical weapons is jeopardizing plans to 
eliminate superpower stocks of those arms and prompting suggestions 
the united states provide newly developed technology to accomplish 
the task 
we could do ourselves and the human race an awful lot of good 
if we would offer this to the soviets said rep larry hopkins 
rky who made the suggestion to secretary of state james a baker 
iii and soviet defense minister gen dmitri t yazov 
the state department has let this thing slide hopkins said 
in a telephone interview friday he is the only westerner to have 
visited the soviet facility 550 miles southwest of moscow and 
wrote the law requiring the united states to destroy 80 percent of 
its chemical weapons by 1997 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
further identified said the offer was made to the soviets that 
they made no response and there was no activity on the issue 
the facility was shut down before it even began operations after 
demonstrations by environmentalists and the littlepublicized 
development has left the soviets without the means of destroying 
their chemical weapons 
the superpowers are trying to negotiate a bilateral chemical 
weapons treaty by the end of the year and this month us and 
soviet officials exchanged what they call baseline data on 
their stockpiles and production plants the data remains 
classified said an administration source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
exchange of the information was part of a superpower deal cut 
last september with the aim of lending momentum to talks among 40 
nations for a global convention banning production of chemical arms 
the global ban faces many obstacles however and the 
superpowers still are debating whether to destroy their entire 
stockpiles as proposed by soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze or to leave them at about 6000 tons apiece as 
proposed by president bush both proposals were made at the united 
nations last september 
we do not believe that they are able right now to destroy the 
amount they claim to have which is 50000 tons sheila buckley 
the top pentagon chemical arms negotiator said in a recent speech 
we may be able to share some of that technology with the 
soviets if they are interested it is not clear yet that they 
are she said 
in march the us army plans to begin testing a disposal 
facility on johnston atoll in the pacific ocean about 800 miles 
southwest of hawaii 
the facility will burn the substances at 2700 degrees 
fahrenheit if it works as planned the army will build similar 
plants to destroy the rest of the us chemical arsenal stored in 
eight states maryland kentucky alabama utah indiana oregon 
arkansas and colorado construction started last september at the 
tooele army depot in utah where 423 percent of the us stocks 
are stored 
us chemical weapons stockpiles are estimated at 30000 tons by 
private analysts and administration sources said that number was 
in the ballpark 
at chapayevsk the soviets planned to destroy two chemicals also 
in the us arsenal the nerve agents sarin and vx by mixing them 
with caustic agents and then burning the residue 
us officials used similar methods to destroy 3250 tons of 
mustard agents in 197475 at the rocky mountain arsenal near 
denver but discarded the technology because it left large 
quantities of toxic waste said col walter l busbee head of the 
us chemical weapons disposal program 
while the united states burns its older weapons dating from 
1969 or before it is making a smaller quantity of newer weapons 
that would also be destroyed if a global convention goes into 
effect 
although the soviets have closed their only disposal facility 
kremlin spokesman gennady gerasimov said last sept 18 that other 
plants would be built no new construction has been announced and 
it could take years 
hopkins in a letter last september to baker said it is clear 
that they will now have to begin rebuilding a disposal capability 
from scratch 
that could mean a three to fiveyear setback in the soviet 
effort he said without outside assistance it is very 
possible the ussr simply might be technically incapable of meeting 
the required disposal schedule under negotiation 
a nongovernment expert on the issue elisa d harris said that 
unless we help them build a facility with proper containment it 
may be several years before they can start meeting their 
commitments under a bilateral accord it does seem to me that 
the people who helped come up with the presidents proposal in 
september must have been aware of the problems that the two sides 
confront

a top soviet official said monday 
that economic reforms in his country must succeed within a year or 
the leaderships credit with the population will vanish 
leonid abalkin a vice premier and the soviets top economic 
reform official told reporters here if the situation on the 
consumer market does not stabilize before the end of the year 
other pretenders will try and seize power 
abalkin who began a twoday private visit to the netherlands 
did not identify those thought to be waiting in the wings to unseat 
the reformminded faction in the soviet leadership 
speaking through a dutch interpreter he warned that those who 
repeat the mistakes of the past years will not be able to play a 
vanguard role in the reform process any more 
referring to soviet president mikhail gorbachev the soviet 
official added if there are great troubles with the economy if 
goods disappear from the stores a leader will lose his influence 
with the population 
abalkin said that regrettably many mistakes have been made 
recently citing errors or delays in the field of tax reform and 
management and planning system changes 
a radical plan to overhaul the ruined soviet economy into a 
marketoriented system a plan abalkin helped coauthor failed 
to be adopted by gorbachevs government late last year 
instead a fiveyear economic plan submitted to the supreme 
soviet the nations working parliament relied heavily on central 
planning now held to be one of the major stumbling blocks to 
meaningful economic reform 
abalkin said that the strongly watereddown reform program was 
the product of compromises and consensus i think its a 
great victory that it has been achieved in such difficult times 
he warned however that this plan must not remain another paper 
project there must be real changes in the economy 
if this government thinks that that is impossible it should 
no longer take responsibility in the face of the parliament and the 
people abalkin said

the catholic church and leaders of 
colombias three biggest political parties urged drug traffickers 
monday to end their terrorism here and suggested they could get 
lenient treatment from the government 
a communique signed by two cardinals and the political leaders 
was the first sign colombia is being worn down in the bloody war 
against traffickers and may be leaning toward a negotiated 
settlement between the drug lords and the government of president 
virgilio barco 
it came as colombia prepared for president bush to attend a drug 
war strategy meeting with latin leaders feb 15 in the coastal city 
of cartagena 
meanwhile in the small northwestern town of pueblo bello gunmen 
forced 31 people into a dump truck and kidnapped them national 
police said monday 
a wave of abductions apparently by drug traffickers has swept 
colombia but gov elena herran de montoya of antioquia state said 
police told her sundays mass kidnapping was the work of a leftist 
guerrilla group the peoples liberation army 
mondays plea for an end to terrorism was signed by cardinals 
mario revollo bravo and alfonso lopez trujillo and by former 
president julio cesar turbay head of the governing liberal party 
former president misael pastrana head of the conservative party 
and diego montana cuellar leader of the marxist patriotic union 
party 
drug traffickers would get less rigorous treatment than if 
they insist in their criminal ways they said urging traffickers 
to stop their violence and release people kidnapped in the last two 
months 
barcos office refused to comment but it would be unlikely such 
a communique would be signed by the leader of his liberal party 
without his approval 
his government began a crackdown on drug traffickers last aug 
18 when they killed a leading presidential candidate carlos galan 
the government extradited 11 suspected traffickers to the united 
states and killed the secondranking member of the medellin cocaine 
cartel gonzalo rodriguez gacha 
the traffickers responded with 262 terrorist acts that killed 
209 people and injured 1243 including bombing a colombian 
airliner and secret police headquarters 
the latest kidnappings brought to 85 the number of people 
abducted in the last 45 days the department of administrative 
security colombias secret police said in a news release 
monday kidnap victims included a congressman ranchers 
businessmen and diego montoya son of barcos general secretary 
in a broadcast interview with the national radio network 
caracol ms herran de montoya she did not say why police blamed 
guerrillas in the sunday abductions or what the kidnap motive was 
pueblo bello 310 miles northwest of bogota the capital is in 
the uraba region both leftist rebels and rightwing death squads 
apparently run by drug traffickers have been active there 
most of the 31 kidnapped were peasants national police 
headquarters in the state capital of medellin said 
while rounding up victims the abductors burned a rice warehouse 
and a tavern police headquarters in medellin said in a communique 
broadcast by the national radio network caracol 
millions of dollars worth of bananas are shipped from the uraba 
region to the united states each year the region has been torn by 
violence as labor unions try to organize banana plantation workers 
rightwing death squads killed two union organizers in the 
region last year 
such death squads throughout colombia killed more than 1000 
people in the last four years a government investigation last year 
found that more than 100 death squads exist in colombia most run 
by drug traffickers

bloomingdales opened 10 minutes late monday 
the first sign that the trendsetting store on manhattans upper 
east side was part of a gigantic proceeding in bankruptcy court 
its the first time in our history weve opened late and the 
first time in our history something like this has happened said 
ann stock a spokeswoman for the 104yearold flagship store on 
manhattans upper east side 
the delay occurred because at 10 am when the store normally 
opens employees were still listening over intercoms to the 
announcement that bloomingdales parent campeau corp was filing 
for bankruptcy protection 
outside the first shoppers waited in a light rain for the doors 
to open and soon it was business as usual shelves were full 
escalators crowded and aggressive sales people enticed buyers 
upstairs to buy furs and purses while others lurked at corners to 
spray customers with new perfumes 
only at the thirdfloor public relations office and outside the 
front door where reporters interviewed customers did anything seem 
amiss 
were trying to keep a lid on it said spokeswoman katie 
locke 
bloomingdales had already been for sale and corporate 
officials said bids for the chain would still be accepted 
in the store though the only sale signs were those typically 
put up after the holidays there was the white sale the 
halfyear sale the onehalf yearly international rug sale 
and hundreds of small signs telling customers to take 20 percent to 
40 percent off ticketed prices 
customers in fact were told they could buy rugs or furniture 
worth 300 or more without beginning payments until may 
obviously this will allow us to go forward with business and 
thats whats really in everybodys heart said a harried ms 
locke 
campeau owner of several major store chains asked a us 
bankruptcy court in cincinnati on monday for chapter 11 protection 
from its creditors in the biggest such filing ever for a retail 
business 
chapter 11 signifies a new beginning and is certainly the best 
alternative for us at bloomingdales it provides us with a fresh 
start and enables us to go forward bloomingdales chairman 
marvin s traub and president jeffrey sherman said in the 
announcement read over store intercoms 
traub and sherman said campeaus decision ended months of 
uncertainty allowed stores to operate normally provided a 
framework for creditors to be paid and most importantly allowed 
merchandise shipments to continue in a healthy atmosphere 
campeau said its chapter 11 filing would free retailers to 
concentrate on sales rather than their financial problems 
about 14000 people work at the bloomingdales flagship store 
six other stores in new york and new jersey two in boston two in 
philadelphia two in washington and one each in miami dallas 
chicago and boca raton fla 
outside the manhattan store lysia okeefe of sydney australia 
said she was a little surprised to hear of bloomingdales troubles 
everyone seems to know bloomingdales she said everyone 
who comes to new york comes to bloomingdales

four were admitted to elko general hospital and 12 others were 
treated and released according to a nursing supervisor all four 
of those hospitalized were in fair condition but she refused to 
discuss their conditions or give any names 
she said the worst injury was to the captain who was admitted 
with a broken leg and possible chest injuries 
federal aviation administration officials said the plane flight 
5855 was on a hop from salt lake city to elko when it went down at 
about 930 am west of the airport in this northeastern nevada 
town of 8800 
the wreckage was spotted by a helicopter pilot who returned to 
elko to fly medical personnel to the scene and to airlift the most 
seriously injured to the hospital 
rescuer pete schory of salt lake city said passengers were 
wandering around when he landed at the crash site 
no one aboard had been thrown from the plane and the fuselage of 
the aircraft was intact on the northeast face of the mountain 
schory said metal debris littered the crash scene and the tail 
section of the plane had torn free about 50 yards uphill from where 
the fuselage came to rest 
right now im feeling that the outcome is wonderful said 
skywest president jerry atkin the thing you hope for in these 
situations is for all survivors its certainly unpleasant to have 
such a thing happen but im very pleased with the outcome

the plane then became airborne briefly before skidding about a 
quarter of a mile down the steep slope

snowing heavily and she saw just a few glimpses of ground below her 
before the crash

president daniel ortega accused 
nicaraguas opposition monday of plotting to set the stage for a 
us invasion like panama by quitting the race and making the 
feb 25 elections look fraudulent 
the national opposition union or uno denied the charge and 
un election observer elliot richardson said he was assured the 
coalition was in the race to stay 
in a voice hoarse from campaign appearances ortega said of uno 
theyre not playing fair because theyre working so as to create 
in nicaragua a situation similar to that of panama and drag the 
united states into it 
ortega said he told richardson a former us attorney general 
who was in nicaragua to represent un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar that he feared such a ploy could set the 
groundwork for us troop intervention comparing it to what 
happened last month in panama 
richardson acknowledged ortegas concerns but said uno officials 
assured him the coalition was not pulling out 
he also said significant improvement had been made in the 
election process but more had to be done to insure a free and fair 
election 
richardson told a news conference after a threehour meeting 
with ortega that campaign violence has declined and the opposition 
had more access to governmentcontrolled media but he said the 
un mission will continue to monitor complaints about rural 
opposition candidates being intimidated 
he also expressed concern about reports of attacks by the 
usbacked contra rebels in the countryside 
opposition spokesman danilo lacayo denied uno was withdrawing 
from the race he called ortegas denunciation another tactic by 
the leftist sandinista government to create the impression the 
opposition is weak taking advantage of the fact that the 
candidates are out of the country 
the campaign of the 14party opposition coalition has been 
stalled by personality clashes defections and complaints over lack 
of money 
uno broke with its campaign routine and did not hold any weekend 
allies for next months national elections in which ortega is 
seeking reelection against uno candidate violeta barrios de 
chamorro publisher of la prensa nicaraguas only opposition 
newspaper 
the main concern that i expressed has to do with the attitude 
of the us government with the contra activity and also the risk 
being run should uno withdraw from the electoral process ortega 
told reporters after meeting richardson 
the uno people have expectations to create a situation like 
panama 
gen manuel antonio noriega annulled panamas may 7 elections 
when returns showed president guillermo endara then the opposition 
candidate was winning by a landslide that was one of the 
incidents that eventually led the united states to invade panama 
dec 20 and oust noriega now jailed in miami awaiting trial on 
drugtrafficking charges 
since then the sandinistas repeatedly said the united states 
plans to invade nicaragua next bush administration officials just 
as insistently denied this 
mrs chamorro fractured a knee in a fall at her home on new 
years eve and has not campaigned since 
she went to houston for medical treatment then to new york and 
washington on monday where she was joined by her soninlaw and 
campaign manager antonio lacayo she was expected back in nicaragua 
tuesday 
uno vice presidential candidate virgilio godoy was out on a 
fiveday trip to california and returned to nicaragua friday 
opposition sources said privately there has been been bickering 
between godoy and antonio lacayo among godoy and unos political 
council of representatives from the 14 parties between the council 
and alfredo cesar an adviser to mrs chamorro and between cesar 
and godoy 
last week uno accused the government of blocking about 2 
million in campaign aid the us congress approved in october but 
over the weekend la prensa reported a government minister agreed to 
release the money 
last week a dozen minor uno candidates pulled out of the race 
citing reasons that ranged from feeling neglected by national 
leadership to complaints they had not been paid campaign expenses 
the sandinistas came to power in july 1979 after overthrowing 
anastasio somoza a rightwing dictator backed by the united states 
the united states later began supporting the contras fighting 
the government 
ortega advanced the election date from november and promised a 
free vote after he and four other central american presidents 
signed a regional peace accord aug 7 pledging to disband the 
contras based in southern honduras

up to 5000 people demonstrated for reform in the 
third street rally in the wintry mongolian capital of ulan bator 
the past month a foreign source said tuesday 
the source said the demonstrators led by the newly formed 
mongolian democratic union mdu attacked former ruler yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal and criticized the mongolias communist party politburo 
or the mongolia peoples revolutionary party 
the demonstrators were peaceful and goodhumored and police 
made no attempt to interfere the source said the temperature was 
about 4 degrees below zero during the gathering sunday on the steps 
of a movie theater in central ulan bator 
the mdu a group thought to be made up of reformminded 
intellectuals and artists also led openair rallies on two sundays 
in december the december demonstrations drew far fewer people 
with crowds estimated at several hundred to 1000 
the group reportedly has adopted a draft charter and petitioned 
the nations parliament for official status 
the source said demonstrators at the most recent protest carried 
banners calling for tsedenbal to be put on trial and urging a 
faster pace of perestroika or reforms like those championed by 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
tsedenbal purged in 1984 after more than three decades in 
power has been criticized by the current government for his forced 
collectivization policies and his bureaucratic centralism 
mongolia a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast 
deserts and grasslands of eastern asia has cautiously followed the 
reform policies taken by its protector state the soviet union 
the government has acknowledged the pace of reform has been too 
slow and members of parliament have called for fundamental changes 
in price and wage systems in the statecontrolled economy 
the source said it was not clear whether political upheaval in 
east europe was influencing events in distant mongolia and it was 
probably wrong to rush toward expectations of dramatic changes 
in the country 
other sources agreed that while the momentum for reform was 
picking up advocates of change appeared willing to work within the 
system and not directly confront the ruling party 
there was no word on the protest by the government

the defiant communist party leader of lithuania 
was chosen president of that independenceminded soviet republic on 
monday in a landslide vote by the legislature 
the election of algirdas brazauskas by a vote of 2284 with 19 
abstentions was a clear endorsement by the republics supreme 
soviet legislature of his stand challenging moscow and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev visited lithuania from thursday to saturday to try to 
persuade lithuanian communists to reverse their dec 20 decision to 
break from the national communist party the lithuanians would not 
budge and gorbachev failed to end the schism he concluded his 
visit saturday with the mild statement we have laid a good 
foundation for continuing the dialogue 
the official news agency tass reported mondays balloting 
sources in the republics media said the supreme soviet also 
voted to restrict voting rights for soldiers and sailors to those 
who have lived in lithuania for at least 10 years in effect 
limiting it to native lithuania residents and a few longserving 
officers 
brazauskas 57 replaced vytautas astrauskas who resigned 
astrauskas 59 had served as lithuanias president since december 
1987 lithuanian activists saw him as a conservative but not a 
vehement foe of the independence drive 
in keeping with gorbachevs drive for democratic reforms 
brazauskas faced alternative candidates national legislator 
kazimeras motieka and romualdas ozolas a leader of the 
proindependence group sajudis 
brazauskas has been the republican communist partys first 
secretary since oct 20 1988 his new title the equivalent of 
president is chairman of the presidium of the lithuanian supreme 
soviet 
lithuanian tv journalist eduardas potasinskas a close observer 
of lithuanian politics said mondays vote will strengthen the 
position of brazauskas in dealing with moscow 
gorbachev pleaded for unity repeatedly while in lithuanian but 
was confronted by proindependence demonstrators at many stops 
public opinion strongly supports independence for the republic 
which was forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 while 
occupied by the red army 
potasinskas said that the supreme soviet in later action voted 
to impose the 10year residency requirement as of feb 24 for 
military personnel to vote in local elections 
that practically limits voting rights to natives of lithuania 
who are serving in their home republic or to a handful of officers 
who have served in the same post for many years 
the national government has struck down similar attempts to 
restrict voting rights in other republics 
no discussion took place at the supreme soviet of how many 
people it would effect and the soviet union does not publicize the 
number of military personnel stationed in its republics

foreign minister ali alatas said 
monday a good chance exists for a meeting on cambodia because none 
of the warring parties objected to an australian proposal to set up 
an interim un authority 
alatas a main organizer of cambodian peace talks spoke to 
reporters upon returning monday from ho chi minh city vietnam 
earlier at a meeting in chiang mai thailand he sought out the 
willingness of the four parties directly involved in the cambodian 
conflict to return to negotiations he also discussed the issue 
with vietnamese and thai officials 
he reported no one has objected to the idea of using the 
basic proposition contained in the australian proposal all 
parties agree to lay down the proposal as a basis for a new 
informal meeting 
the indonesian minister said australias basic proposal will not 
resolve the conflict it is clear that further negotiations are 
needed on the form of the un interim government 
alatas said he therefore will report to president suharto and 
then consult with france which with indonesia presided over an 
international conference on cambodia held last august he also said 
he will discuss with members of asean the association of southeast 
asian nations 
asean groups indonesia malaysia thailand singapore the 
philippnes and brunei 
i have the feeling that perhaps the time has now come for us 
to meet again there are reasonable chances for meeting but 
we should be prepared well the third or fourth week of february 
would most probably be proposed he said 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 toppling the communist 
khmer rouge government that killed hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians during its 3 years in power as it sought to enforce a 
primitive agrarian communism 
last september vietnam said it had withdrawn the last of its 
troops from cambodia leaving the government it installed there to 
fight a threeparty resistance coalition which includes the khmer 
rouge

church bells across the country tolled the loss of martin luther 
king jr on his birthday monday a ringing reminder of the racial 
conflicts the slain civil rights leader struggled to overcome but 
which still haunt the nation 
with each ring we are called to an accountability an 
accountability of the soul and of the hearts conscience that asks 
what have you done to let freedom ring asked pennsylvania gov 
robert p casey during a ceremony at the liberty bell 
a moment of silence was called to reflect on kings lessons of 
nonviolence in his pursuit of racial equality the 
washingtonbased federal holiday commission said bells chimed at 
1230 pm est in all 50 states and 144 countries the new york 
stock exchange paused for a moment at noon 
today the sound of liberty is being heard all around the 
world said james farmer founder of the congress for racial 
equality who pounded the liberty bell three times with his fist 
those who have been denied liberty love it most dr king loved 
liberty and he fought and died for it 
most of the celebrations were peaceful but the memory of kings 
espousal of nonviolent resistance didnt prevent fights from 
breaking out in new orleans following a parade in his honor 
attended by tens of thousands of people 
two whites were arrested after a fight in which a black man was 
hit with nailstudded boards a teenager was fatally stabbed and a 
young black man was critically wounded by a stray bullet in 
separate fights between groups of black teens officials said 
in san diego racist graffitti was sprayed on signs on a freeway 
named for himand demonstrations protesting nonobservance of the 
holiday took place in arizona new hampshire and elsewhere 
the observances followed church services parades and other 
celebrations held during the weekend before the federal holiday 
which for the first time falls on kings actual birthday he would 
have been 61 
much of mondays focus was on atlanta where king grew up as the 
son of a baptist minister 
now is the time to organize a global nonviolent movement 
based on dr kings teachings to put an end to the scourges of 
poverty hunger racism and bigotry war and militarism said his 
widow coretta scott king at an annual ecumenical service at 
ebenezer baptist church where her husband delivered some of his 
most stirring orations 
a march of celebration also was held despite bitter 
objections from one of kings top lieutenants in the civil rights 
movement who charged the parade trivialized the day and wasted 
money that could serve the poor 
this has been prostituted more than any other holiday except 
jesus christs birthday the rev hosea williams said at a news 
conference in front of an atlanta housing project 
about 25000 people lined los angeles streets for the fifth 
annual king birthday celebration parade down a boulevard named for 
him and 2500 turned out for an annual breakfast in boston 
during his lifetime king led nonviolent marches and protests 
in the south in the 1950s and 1960s in a quest to end 
discrimination against blacks and other minorities 
his first blow against racism came when he led a year long 
bocott of segregated buses in montgomery ala from there he 
established the southern christian leadership conference to set the 
pace of working peacefully for equal rights for blacks in 1964 he 
received the nobel peace prize 
he was shot and killed on april 4 1968 in memphis tenn 
but racial inequities and clashes still tear at americas 
consciousness today 
in the southeast there have been a series of bombings and 
threats apparently racially motivated and in boston race 
relations were strained after an apparent hoax in which a white man 
claimed a black mugger fatally shot his pregnant wife and wounded 
him 
boston residents on monday spoke of the racial implications of 
charles stuarts grisly fraud 
the stuart case has shown how fragile race relations are in 
this country said state rep byron rushing and its become a 
kind of metaphor for healing 
the day however came at a moment of gains for blacks the 
first day on the job for the nations first elected black governor 
in virginia and the start of a new administion for new york citys 
first black mayor 
l douglas wilders victory in virginia inspires some said 
is it not poetic justice that the first day of doug wilders 
stay in office takes place on the birthday of dr martin luther 
king jr the rev jesse jackson asked at a prayer breakfast in 
washington dc 
in new york about 120 people who walked across the brooklyn 
bridge to city hall in the 10th annual march were greeted by mayor 
david dinkins

high school students walked out of morning classes to recognize 
martin luther king jr day which their school did not observe 
a school custodian hoisted the american flag halfstaff as the 
students recited the pledge of allegiance during the halfhour 
ceremony 
new hampshire is one of four states without any form of king 
holiday the others are arizona montana and idaho some other 
states keep workers on the job but mark the day in other ways

register and vote in a referendum this fall over whether to let a 
king day observance become law another 2000 people marched in

a blind woman used her sense of touch and smell 
to identify a 14yearold neighbor as the person who raped her 
police said but it was unclear monday how the identification would 
be received in court 
police were amazed at the womans ability to identify a suspect 
in the assault which occurred late saturday 
the 24yearold woman legally blind for three years recognized 
the scent of the suspects cologne when she accompanied police on a 
search of her building investigators said 
she recognized his hands during a lineup police said 
it was the smell of the cologne the woman said sunday 
that was the major key i could tell too by the size of his 
hands and how rough or smooth they were 
she said the assailant held his hands over her mouth during the 
attack 
the suspect who lives in the victims apartment building on the 
same floor was named in a juvenile petition and ordered held in a 
youth home he was scheduled to appear tuesday in juvenile court 
for a status hearing 
police said authorities will seek a court order for testing to 
determine if bodily fluids left at the scene of the attack might be 
the youths 
but a detective questioned whether the victims identification 
of her attacker would hold up in court 
we have no voice no witnesses said detective karl kurth 
its very little the sense of smell and feel is that enough to 
stand in a court of law i dont know 
a northwestern university law professor jim hadadd said monday 
the case appeared to be unique 
there have been cases involving voice identifications but 
ive never heard of identifying somebody by his scent or the feel 
of his hands hadadd said 
the woman said she was in the apartment buildings laundry room 
when the assailant shoved her in a corner and raped her afterward 
he handed her a used condom she said 
the woman said it was the third time shed been the target of

turkey has reaffirmed its promise to 
downstream neighbors to share the waters of the euphrates river 
cut off for one month to fill a reservoir and allow construction 
work iraqs oil minister said monday 
the minister issam abdul rahim alchalabi also said turkeys 
project to harness the waters will benefit neighboring countries in 
the arid region 
alchalabi arrived sunday a day after turkey diverted much of 
the euphrates to fill the reservoir of its giant ataturk dam he 
delivered a message from iraqi president saddam hussein to turkish 
president turgut ozal 
alchalabi said he had a very positive an excellent talk 
with ozal but neither side would comment on turkeys answer to an 
iraqi request that the river diversion be reduced from a month to 
two weeks 
turks say they need at least one month to fill the reservoir of 
the 4 billion project the centerpiece of the massive southeast 
anatolia project of 15 dams and 18 hydroelectric plants to be 
erected on the euphrates and tigris rivers 
the onemonth diversion will cut off 75 percent of the water 
syria and iraq get from the river which has been the lifeblood of 
the region that was once known as mesopotamia 
the 1460milelong river originates in the mountains of eastern 
turkey runs through syria and then iraq before joining the tigris 
and emptying into the persian gulf 
the blockage will seriously harm iraq and could cause a real 
agricultural disaster in the long term iraqs ruling baath 
socialist partys newspaper althawra warned in a frontpage 
editorial sunday 
the paper said an agreement between turkey syria and iraq is 
needed for the sharing of the euphrates waters in a flexible 
way 
syria formally protested to turkey late monday saying the 
cutoff violated international law informed sources reported the 
sources who requested anonymity said the foreign ministry 
summoned turkish ambassador erhan tuncel in damascus and told him 
ankaras step was an unjustified precedent 
for a month before the reduction of waters turkey released 
twice the usual amount downstream so southern neighbors could store 
it in their reservoirs turkish officials said

a professor who says he knows who wrote an 
article speculating on the future of change in the soviet union 
stood by his assertion monday though the man he identified as the 
mysterious z denied the claim william e jackson jr an 
international affairs professor at the university of arkansas at 
fayetteville said last week and reiterated monday that z 
was his longtime friend william odom a retired lieutenant general 
who once directed the national security agency 
jackson was formerly a staffer for exsen j william fulbright 
dark onetime chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
z is the pseudonym attached to an article in the scholarly 
journal daedalus and excerpted recently in the new york times the 
article takes a dim view of soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
chances of making the soviet system economically efficient and 
politically democratic while maintaining the primacy of the 
communist party 
odom reached monday by telephone at his office in the political 
science department at yale university said of speculation that he 
is z i deny it i dont know how this thing has gotten off 
the ground its just wild 
he declined further comment last week he also denied the claim 
but told a reporter for the arkansas democrat that the reporter 
would be correct in quoting jackson 
you can write what he says odom said 
what jackson said last week and again monday was that odom was 
z 
for good reason i think i am not stepping back from the 
conclusion of my original speculation jackson said in a prepared 
statement monday odom is z 
jackson said he had known odom for 30 years ever since we 
were graduate students in the russian institute at columbia 
university i have read everything he has ever publicly written 
sometimes in draft form and i know his writing style 
jackson acknowledged that odom has not admitted to him he is 
z but said he talked with him by telephone for about 1 hours 
sunday night 
according to jackson odom said he was in a predicament 
because he in fact denied being z but had told the democrats 
reporter that the z article was like some things he had 
written and also that you and jackson can make any speculation 
you want to make 
he told me that he thought my deductive reasoning proved 
what a brilliant analyst i was jackson said

a man who said he was a personal banker to 
deposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega faces a federal trial on 
money laundering charges tuesday along with a luxembourg 
bankholding company and five other bank officers 
two men from medellin colombia home of the powerful cocaine 
cartel named for that city are also defendants in the us 
district court trial in tampa 
during a twoyear sting operation undercover us customs 
agents penetrated powerful colombian syndicates and helped launder 
an estimated 32 million from us cocaine sales federal 
authorities said

of its officers were indicted on moneylaundering charges in tampa 
in october 1988

american division director of bcci told senate investigators he 
personally managed a secret account noriega opened at the banks 
panamanian branch in 1982 awan said noriega was the only one who 
could authorize withdrawals and that a balance of up to 25 million 
was kept in the account 
awan told senate investigators that noriega closed his bcci 
acocunt when the indictments were announced awan denied knowledge 
of any drug dealing by noriega or the bank 
according to the indictment undercover agents first contacted 
bcci representatives in february 1987 then began opening bank 
accounts at different branches bcci officials were to receive drug 
money and put it in certificates of deposit in one of the branches 
agents said 
the branches used included locations in france panama uruguay 
the bahamas luxembourg and england 
bank officials would then create a loan at another branch 
permit the drug traffickers to withdraw the funds then repay the 
loan with money in the certificates of deposit investigators said

hussain operations officer in the panama branch akbar a bilgrami

while federal prosecutors were moving to 
indict panamas manuel antonio noriega on narcotics charges the 
drug enforcement administration was maintaining close ties with him 
and offering praise for his cooperation in the war against drugs a 
congressional report shows 
the dea has long welcomed our close association and we stand 
ready to proceed jointly against international drug traffickers 
whenever the opportunity arises drug enforcement administrator 
jack lawn wrote to noriega less than a year before the indictment 
was entered in federal court in miami in february 1988 
lawn had special praise for the work of luis quiel noriegas 
liaison to the dea as integral to the success of fighting 
international drug trafficking 
but according to the final report of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on narcotics issued in december 1988 quiel 
was also noriegas liaison to the medellin drug cartel and thus 
in a position to alert the drug traffickers to whatever information 
the dea had provided him

frederick forsyth may be best known for his 
espionage sagas on the page but a good plot he says should make 
good tv as well 
the story comes first and it would in either medium said 
the bestselling novelist of the odessa file and the day of 
the jackal whose sixpart series frederick forsyth 
presents continues jan 17 on cable televisions usa network 
the upcoming episode pride and extreme prejudice is the 
second of six twohour thrillers plotted by forsyth and written by 
murray smith forsyth explained the division of labor dialogue 
is what murray does best what i do best is devise the stories 
brian dennehy plays bruno morenz a western operative based in 
bonn west germany who has a nervous breakdown while on a mission 
to the east alan howard plays the british agent who tries to save 
morenz from the kgb the supporting cast includes lisa eichhorn and 
simon cadell 
forsyth said the episodes emphasis on psychology was unusual 
for him 
its a more human storyline the guys gone back to childhood 
hes just a blubbering wreck forsyth 51 said in an interview 
hes been pushed too far one feels sorry for him 
forsyth said he was intrigued by the prospect of such an event 
happening behind the iron curtain 
normally hed have a breakdown at home or in the office but 
to have it in the middle of east germany he said his voice 
trailing off forsyth is coproducer as well of frederick 
forsyth presents which began dec 13 and continues through june 
each of the thrillers is meant to stand on its own only alan 
howards character sam mccready figures in each one 
later episodes involve such familiar forsyth terrain as 
defectors terrorism and even a character carlos the jackal 
modeled on the assassin who hijacked the opec oil ministry meeting 
in vienna in 1975 
a former foreign correspondent forsyth said he drew his plots 
from current headlines everything i write is triggered by 
something 
often i read something in a newspaper and that triggers some 
other idea what if what would happen if would it be possible 
to 
he expressed no worries about keeping up with current events in 
a political climate where ideologies and allegiances seem to change 
daily 
consider for example east berlin where the communist 
authorities have relinquished their grip and people from the east 
cross freely through the berlin wall into the west none of this 
he says invalidates the fact that east berlin has been a very 
nasty place 
he added that pride and extreme prejudice could be regarded 
as a period piece 
the episode happened before when the berlin wall really was 
impregnable and east germany really was a police state and i think 
people accept that he said i dont think everyone believes 
whats on screen had to happen in the last 24 hours 
forsyth said he regarded politics as a spectator sport but 
he remained skeptical about the socalled gorbachev revolution 
that has seen a softening of hardline ideology as east and west 
effect a rapport 
i think soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has a very slim 
chance of delivering the economy hes talking about said 
forsyth the problems hes inherited with the crazy communist 
economic system are insuperable 
its like trying to turn a tmodel ford into a grand prix 
racecar by fine tuning the engine the model ford still goes at a 
top speed of whatever it will always 
forsyths most recent fulllength novel the negotiator is 
a hostage drama set in 1991 and it should arrive on small screens 
around the same time 
the spy thriller doesnt make a blockbuster forsyth said 
of the feature films made from his books only fred zinnemanns 
1973 the day of the jackal about an attempted assassination of 
french leader charles de gaulle was a hit 
theres something they lose in translation he said 
obviously one would like to have had a fatal attraction or a 
jagged edge 
the negotiator will be filmed for home box office in the 
united states possibly in partnership with granada television in 
britain he said 
before that project starts shooting forsyth plans to rest 
tending to the hertfordshire farm west of london which he bought 18 
months ago

real estate agents have been besieged with 
requests for housing and office space over the past few weeks as 
businesses worldwide try to get a foot in the door of an 
increasingly less divided berlin 
but this crowded enclave of capitalism has hung out a no 
vacancy sign until opportunities open up in the relatively empty 
east berlin 
there is definitely a boom in demand that began late last 
year said willi bendzko head of the german rental agents 
association here and owner of a real estate firm but we have 
practically no bureau space to offer 
wolfgang heinze of the west berlin economics ministry says his 
office cannot estimate the number of businessmen scouring the city 
for office and living space but it is absolutely clear that 
numerous west european and overseas firms want to relocate or open 
new branches here 
the sudden interest for expansion into both sectors of berlin is 
clearly connected with the rise in expectations of an eventual 
reunification of the two germanys and the commanding economic power 
the new state would wield 
planners and politicians on both sides of the city expect a 
greater berlin with as many as 6 million residents to be 
functioning as a single municipality within the next two to three 
years 
west berlins current population is about 21 million east 
berlin has 19 million residents 
conservatives in support of chancellor helmut kohls push for a 
formally reunited germany believe that the provisional west german 
capital set up in bonn 40 years ago could be relocated to berlin as 
well but that expectation is seldom expressed openly in fear of 
chilling the new spirit of cooperation that marks intergerman 
relations 
east germanys interim government remains dominated by 
communists who oppose efforts that could endanger the sovereignty 
of their state 
but they have indicated support for joint ventures with western 
companies and an openness to foreign investment and that has 
stirred the attention of the international business community 
its too early to tell if there will be a major move of 
american business here said dave pozorski of the us missions 
economics department but my personal opinion is that it would 
make a lot of sense 
with 112 million potential consumers in the warsaw pact nations 
of eastern europe trade and manufacturing companies especially 
from west germany are being attracted by the emerging market 
opportunities 
the day is coming when berlin in all practicality will be one 
city commented ralf schlichting spokesman for west berlins 
housing and construction department we dont know when this is 
coming but it is coming 
in december west berlin officials opened negotiations with east 
berlin authorities on how the two city governments can work 
together to resolve their housing transportation and utilities 
problems in the new spirit of cooperation that now prevails 
schlichting says east berlin has at least 30000 empty 
apartments due to last years mass exodus of young workers and 
their families to west germany more than 340000 emigrated in 1989 
at the same time west berlin already has a shortage of 50000 
apartments 
the opening up of a broad security strip behind the berlin wall 
has also freed some centrally located property that could be used 
for new office construction in east berlin 
much of east berlins available housing needs renovation but if 
brought up to western standards it could be rented out for hard 
currency easing both the economic plight of the east german state 
and the dearth of housing in west berlin 
rents in west berlin are much higher than in east berlin a 
rentcontrolled threeroom apartment in west berlin runs about 300 
to 470 a month and 1200 to 1300 for an apartment of the same 
size on the open market in east berlin housing is heavily 
subsidized and renters are charged 3 percent to 5 percent of their 
salaries 
in west berlin 1110 square feet of commercial space about 
the same size of a threeroom apartment here rents for about 
1300 to 1800 a month 
the number of apartment seekers mounts daily in west berlin 
the shortage has become so severe in recent months that 
apartment seekers line up by the hundreds each saturday afternoon 
outside the berliner morgenpost office to get hold of the first 
copies of the sunday newspaper and its newest real estate ads

the fact that black soldiers fought in the

glory one of the films stars denzel washington admits that 
he was unaware 
i knew absolutely nothing said the actor who portrays a 
bitter runaway slave i didnt even know that blacks fought in 
the civil war the american history classes that i took didnt seem 
to dwell on that at all it was inspiring for me it gave me a lot 
of energy to continue research and get further and further into it 
although the character i play isnt based on a real person i 
kind of put ideas together that i found from reading slave 
narratives and things like that 
glory is partly based on two books about the 54th 
massachusetts colored volunteer infantry lay this laurel and 
one gallant rush as well as the letters of robert gould shaw 
the boston brahmin who commanded the allblack unit the script by 
kevin jarre describes how shaw had to fight his army superiors in 
order to outfit his soldiers and win battle duty 
matthew broderick portrays gould and the soldiers include 
washington morgan freeman jihmi kennedy and andre braugher with 
shaved head and scarred face washington the dedicated doctor of 
tvs st elsewhere the martyred steven biko of cry freedom 
and the earnest police chief of the mighty quinn is scarcely 
recognizable 
someone told me they didnt know i was in the movie the 
33yearold actor said with a smile i wanted to do something 
different and to feel removed from the present time its difficult 
to do a period piece and to give yourself as an actor a different 
feeling as though youre in a different time 
one of the ironies of glory comes at the climax when the 
54th is sent on the first wave against the impregnable fort wagner 
which guarded charleston harbor it appears to be a suicide mission 
these men were looking for an opportunity to prove 
themselves said washington the battle was no more dangerous 
than their daytoday lives with the constant threat of slavery and 
slave masters with their mentality over their heads they were 
looking for the opportunity to have a fair fight and to have a 
rifle as well regardless of the odds 
on july 18 1863 despite extensive fatigue and poor rations 
the 54th massachusetts marched across half a mile of sand to lead 
the illplanned attack on fort wagner the regiment lost more than 
40 percent of its men as did the white regiments that followed 
fort wagner was never taken by union soldiers 
filmgoers will be shocked by the movies battle scenes in which 
confederate and union soldiers march toward each other and fire 
pointblank the tactic is historically accurate washington noted 
this was the first war with new weaponry he said but 
they were still using revolutionary war tactics the rifles they 
used then were less accurate and less powerful they still fought 
the war between the states as they call it with a lot of honor 
and regimentation 100 feet apart blowing their brains out 
denzel washington grew up in mount vernon ny he began 
studying medicine at fordham university but soon switched to drama 
after a session at american conservatory theater in san francisco 
he began getting new york jobs among them was joseph papps 
production of coriolanus with morgan freeman in the title 
role i had about six lines like my lord they are coming 
he recalled 
he began in films as george segals son in carbon copy he 
then played an angry gi in a soldiers story and signed on as 
dr philip chandler in st elsewhere 
cry freedom brought him an academy nomination but 
surprisingly little work his only offer was for the mighty 
quinn which had a brief release last year despite raves from 
critics 
now his career is running smoothly beside glory for which 
he is a likely oscar candidate he has completed heart 
condition a wild comedy with bob hoskins and love supreme

vicki peterson a school teacher and fulltime 
college student on a tight budget loves to see movies on the big 
screen 
but with firstrun movies going for 550 or more she has 
turned to a cheaper alternative discount theaters running older 
movies and sometimes double features these costcutting movie 
houses cater to a more dollarconscious crowd 
i only go to 99cent movies said peterson at paul sanchezs 
fourscreen flowers 99 cent theater in takoma park md near her 
home 
you can bring the whole family said another filmgoer stu 
jarboe you dont always have to eat the food and save some 
money 
but moviegoers such as peterson and jarboe might face more 
limited choices because of a dispute between paramount pictures 
corp and discount theater operators paramount has raised its 
rentals and some operators have responded by ceasing to show 
paramount pictures 
its either that they say or tell customers that the buck 
stops here 
since last spring paramount has been charging operators 105 
for each adult ticket and 75 cents for each childs ticket prior 
to that the annual charge was a flat 35 percent of gross ticket 
sales paramount says the new pricing is a more equitable way of 
spreading the high cost of making movies 
however paramounts action might threaten the discount theater 
industry 
if any of the other companies go ahead with the same type of 
thing discount theaters are either going to have to close or raise 
the price says sanchez who owns four theaters in the washington 
area 
jack clark president of the national association of discount 
theaters said the new pricing by paramount caused him to lose 
money when he ran a discount theater in pullman wash 
he showed indiana jones and the last crusade and under the 
new policy made 1641 in a week charging customers 150 per 
ticket under the old price scale from paramount he made 3148 in 
a week showing the same movie clark said he was 269 in the hole 
after expenses with paramounts new rates 
discount theater operators who number several hundred 
nationwide are fighting back with a lobbying and public relations 
campaign aimed at forcing the company to cut prices 
board member randy hester of the national association of 
discount theaters a trade organization based in seattle urges 
moviegoers and even members of congress to write letters of protest 
to paramount 
hester who owns the dallasbased cinemark usa chain hopes 
lawmakers will see what this is going to do to many moviegoers and 
will try to take action to stop it 
there are many many people in the country that cant afford 
more than a dollar for a movie ticket he said it wouldnt 
take long after visiting a discount theater to see that this is not 
the same group of people that are shelling out 5 6 or 7 for a 
firstrun movie ticket 
there are no lines for movies at dollar theaters thats because 
dollar theaters show movies long after theyve had their first run 
at pricey movie palaces and multiplexes some discount movie 
theaters are rundown with dimly lighted lobbies worn carpets and 
floors sticky from spilled soft drinks and gooey candy 
thats moviegoer les andersons biggest complaint it costs a 
lot in shoes because they stick to the floor and they dont leave 
when you leave 
still the theaters are havens for the elderly the poor and 
students 
at the request of the discount theater association sen howard 
m metzenbaum dohio has asked the justice department to 
investigate possible antitrust violations to see if paramount may 
be hiking rates in conjunction with other studios 
paramounts pricing system has a negative impact on the poor 
senior citizens and others on fixed incomes says metzenbaum who 
is chairman of a subcommittee on antitrust monopolies and business 
rights 
barry london president of paramount pictures denies any 
antitrust violation saying the companys change in its rental 
policy is in no way conspiratorial 
london says his company is just trying to make discount theaters 
bear their fair share of the cost of production distribution and 
marketing he says the overall success of the movie is the engine 
that pulls the whole locomotive 
hester however considers this a form of buckpassing to the 
dollar theaters he insists the cost of making the movie is already 
recovered from many sources 
we pay the film shipping cost both ways they make no 
additional prints for us and give us no money for advertising he 
says we get the print after the firstrun exhibitor has told us 
they can make no more money 
he says the higher rental charges are nothing but extra 
income for paramount london counters that hesters charges are 
ridiculous and he says dollar movie houses arent in 
business as a public service 
what theyre basically doing is using our product to attract 
patrons so they can charge them concession prices equivalent to 
firstrun movie houses he says 
concession prices vary from movie house to movie house sanchez 
for example charges 150 for popcorn and 1 for drinks hester 
says his prices are comparable to regular theaters clark charged 
150 for a large soda and 325 for a large popcorn 
sales of popcorn and other goodies london said generate the 
profits that keep the discount theater business popping

with four wives hashishsmoking 
bodyguards a black beard and turban to match amir said ahmad 
doesnt look much like a general in afghanistans army 
clutching a sovietmade ak47 automatic rifle he resembles a 
moslem guerrilla warrior two years ago he was one 
but after fighting the government and the soviet occupation of 
afghanistan for eight years ahmad switched sides and became a 
general in the forces he once fought 
ideology was not the reason he said for ahmad it was a 
question of who was going to pay him the most and leave him alone 
i dont go with anyone forever he said in an interview in 
his expansive guest house in kabul i only go with the one who 
works for my men when that stops i switch sides 
in exchange for his pledge of allegiance to president najib 
ahmad was made a general in afghanistans military a member of 
parliament and given arms food and hundreds of thousands of 
dollars a month for him and his 3000 men the government also 
promised that his militia group which controls parts of herat 
province in the west could continue its business activities there 
a new mercedes benz car and the kabul guest house were thrown in 
for good measure 
i dont know how much money i have but i have too much 
ahmad said with a smile a circle of heavily armed men surrounding 
the bearded general clucked approvingly the chocolatelike smell 
of hashish filled the room 
ahmad is just one of dozens of former guerrilla commanders who 
have left the usbacked mujahedeen as the guerrillas are known 
and joined the government since najib announced his national 
reconciliation policy two years ago 
the policy combines elements of a return to the traditional 
afghan way of solving problems with the united front policy 
used by communist parties in trouble 
in the traditional relationship tribes pledged loyalty to a 
central government while retaining autonomy in their local affairs 
the united front has been traditionally used by communist 
parties that cannot control a country by themselves with this 
strategy they unite with whomever they can gain control and then 
go after their old allies 
the policy is an aboutface for the ruling peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan which came to power in 1978 and attempted to 
exert central control over the country and institute a communist 
revolution 
in other areas as well najibs national reconciliation has 
halted afghanistans communist experiment government monopolies on 
fuel and sugar transportation were lifted recently and the state 
issued a plea to all private traders to help feed the people during 
the winter when food is scarce because of the weather and the war 
the government now denies it is communist kabuls mayor hardline 
marxist abdul hakim misaq recently said even that traffickers in 
stolen goods would not be prosecuted as long as they got the 
pilfered goods to the market 
diplomats in kabul mostly from the soviet bloc or nonaligned 
countries said the governments attempt to placate the powerful 
militias by allowing them to keep their weapons might replace one 
problem civil war with another lawlessness indeed the afghan 
tribes are no longer armed with flintlock rifles heavy weapons 
fill their mountain strongholds 
i have tanks armored personnel carriers rockets mortars and 
bombs ahmad said with a great grin if things get difficult i 
can get airplanes fighter jets you name it 
in my territory i am the boss 
in herat ahmad is called amir which means prince or lord his 
group owns several villages and the largest cement factory in the 
province giving them an effective monopoly on the local 
construction industry 
they also man checkpoints on the main provincial road and along 
with other militia groups demand payments of food or money from 
trucks in exchange for safe passage 
in kabul an afghan doctor said she treats dozens of gunshot 
wounds a month many of them inflicted by militiamen 
its like your wild west said the americantrained 
physician speaking on condition of anonymity these men all want 
to be cowboys 
ahmads family has lived in herat for generations after the 
1978 revolution the government attempted to break the power of 
local lords like the ahmad family and launched a radical policy of 
land reform 
many of the lords went to war ahmad joined the mujahedeen 
which means islamic holy warriors in their fight to overthrow the 
government 
the arrival of the soviet army in afghanistan in december 1979 
further galvanized ahmads resolve to oppose the kabul government 
but eight years of fighting hurt his militia band ahmad also took 
four wives and had eight children 
my children became more important than war he said the 
government offered us a good deal we run our villages ourselves 
and have peace is that such a strange thing

these days it seems if youve got something to 
sell theres a buyer in japan no matter how big the price tag so 
its hardly surprising that japanese collectors of western art are 
on a spending spree but many insiders in the art world both at 
home and abroad are disturbed by the trend 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
japanese speculators are scouring the art world for 
the best money can buy catapulting prices upward with a series of 
audacious bids at auction houses in new york and london 
many museums and smaller galleries are dismayed saying they 
cant compete 
this new buying spree is being led by real estate speculators 
and bootstrap entrepreneurs such as yasumichi morishita a japanese 
moneylender who made his fortune with highinterest loans and has a 
reputation as an aggressive and indiscriminate buyer of art 
morishita has been the biggest japanese buyer in recent months 
dealers say as he fortifies his stock of impressionist and 
postimpressionist paintings at his gallery aska international 
morishita and other japanese investors spent 230 million in a 
series of auctions in november alone 
along with individuals enriched by the appreciation of the yen 
and ballooning stock and land prices these new japanese buyers 
have become a strong force in many collectors markets from 
antique musical instruments to vintage wines 
nowhere is this as evident as in the market for impressionist 
and modern paintings where japanese dealers and collectors are 
snapping up about 40 percent to 50 percent of total sales at 
londonbased christies and sothebys auction houses in some 
cases dealers say with little regard for quality and price 
the renewed japanese appetite for western art became evident in 
1987 when yasuda marine and fire insurance co paid 399 million 
for vincent van goghs sunflowers at the time the worlds 
most expensive painting 
western collectors still are able to set artmarket benchmarks 
such as the 539 million sale of vincent van goghs 1889 
irises in 1987 to australian tycoon alan bond now the world 
record sothebys announced on jan 10 that irises is now back 
on the auction block also a picasso selfportrait yo 
picasso sold last may for 4785 million to kentucky executive 
wendell cherry 
but in a satellitelinked tokyoparis auction on nov 30 a 
japanese resort and autoracing firm nippon autopolis nudged 
aside cherry as owner of the worlds second most costly painting 
with its 489 million knockdown of picassos les noces de 
pierrette 
nippon autopolis is far from the only japanese winner of recent 
art prizes shigeki kameyama wealthy owner of mountain tortoise 
gallery in tokyo set a new record for a living artist with his 
2068 million purchase of dutch artist willem de koonings 
interchange in november 
morishita made the following buys at auctions in new york and 
london 
10 million for one of picassos most important early works 
la maternite motherhood on nov 27 in london 
68 million for paul gauguins 1889 painting of a breton boy 
in a landscape at a sothebys auction on nov 28 
25 million out of total sales of 13129 million from the 
estate of the late campbell soup heir john t dorrance in october 
including 715 million for van goghs man at sea 
the new japanese corporate buyers are entirely different 
players from the owners of small and mediumsized firms who used 
to just collect privately says kazuko shiomi president of 
sothebys in tokyo 
corporations that have made their money in real estate or 
financing have become professionals part of the art industry 
traditional dealers havent exactly welcomed gruff nononsense 
morishita police have investigated his aichi corporate finance 
firm several times and he received a oneyear suspended sentence 
in 1986 for falsifying documents used in stock transactions 
kiyotaka kori askas gallery manager and a former secretary to 
the tycoon says morishita wouldnt mind having a better image 
in some reports weve got a bad reputation and mr morishita 
doesnt like that kori said as he relaxed on the italian silk 
couch in askas gallery a bright spot of pastels and chrome beside 
a grimy freeway in central tokyo 
morishita who lives in a brick mansion in one of tokyos 
toniest neighborhoods wasnt available for an interview he 
really doesnt like having his picture taken said the gallery 
manager

kori says morishita makes a practice of bidding under the house 
estimate at auctions but when he really wants something theres 
no limit our purpose is to get the painting 
we hope that in the future if you want to see a monet or 
renoir you will go to aska international 
experts say such doordie purchases are underpinning a 
worldwide surge in the art market which has continued unabated 
despite shocks in other financial markets thus inviting still more 
investment 
sothebys composite art market index which set prices at 100 in 
1975 had inflated to 911 by late november up from 732 in the fall 
of 1988 and 476 in 1987 
in areas where japanese buying is strongest impressionist and 
postimpressionist modern 19001950 and contemporary paintings 
indexes have more than doubled in the past two years to 1525 
1415 and 1945 respectively in late november 
the market is very very strong compared with other investment 
instruments said ms shiomi of sothebys which has decided to 
hold auctions in japan twice a year 
japanese collectors made similar forays into international art 
markets in the early 1970s when the first flush of affluence led 
trading firms among others to diversify their investments beyond 
the tea ceremony bowls they traditionally collected that first 
flirtation with art dealing ended abruptly with the 197374 oil 
crisis 
today investors like morishita who says he has been privately 
collecting western and japanese art for 30 years see a market they 
expect to continue strong 
japans imports of art antiques and collectibles quadrupled 
from 4114 million in 1986 to 1712 billion in 1988 according to 
the finance ministry 
in the first nine months of 1989 imports of paintings alone 
totaled 155 billion the ministry says 
ms shiomi attributes the seemingly unquenchable japanese thirst 
for western art to a desire for a better quality of life after 
decades of hard work and deprivation 
the big tycoons always had big art collections but after 
world war ii they reinvested into business instead she says 
now we are paying attention to what we are really working for 
but longtime members of japans exclusive bijutsu art club 
the inner circle of established art dealers fear they could be 
driven out of the market by upstart newcomers like aska 
the powerful companies like aichi morishitas finance 
company could wipe us out complains kazuo fujii who says he 
started collecting from scratch just after japan lost world war ii 
weve studied art weve committed our lives to cultivating 
our clients these guys have no commitment if the market sours in 
a couple years theyll just drop it 
fujii is quick to point out however that it isnt just 
japanese tycoons who are driving prices sky high 
look at the enormous profits the british railways pension fund 
has made he says showing an old catalog detailing how the 
british fund acquired art works at modest prices and resold them 
for hefty profits 
so far traditional dealers such as fujii havent fared badly in 
the race to capture the best many of the cozy galleries in tokyos 
fashionable ginza shopping district have fine collections of 
impressionists along with works by japanese artists 
many small museums and galleries scattered throughout the 
country are displaying prized picassos and monets as japan goes 
through a western art boom that lures thousands of people in search 
of fashionable culture 
but the spending power of the big buyers far outweighs the 
smaller japanese galleries ms shiomi says 
art is just one of their investments she says if they 
sell fine if they dont theyve still got a nice gallery 
in this country where appearances often are everything 
collecting western art is one way to acquire a nice image a sign 
of understanding things western and being scholarly ms shiomi 
says 
nippon autopolis has bought an expensive veneer of culture its 
new picasso for an autoracing theme resort its building in the 
mountains of southern japan 
the resort will boast a formula one auto racing circuit a 
hotel yearround skiing on artificial snow and a fishing hole as 
well as a museum featuring the picasso 
its aim the company says is to create a new culture 
harmonizing humanity and nature

billy wayne sinclair convicted killer knows 
his way around louisianas angola prison in his 24 years behind 
bars he escaped the electric chair to become a hotshot jailhouse 
lawyer and prizewinning journalist picking up a bride along the 
way but then sinclair broke the rules of the underworld he became 
a snitch 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
his life is in ruins but billy wayne 
sinclair is pleased that it also has become downright dull 
hes had enough ups and downs since the day they clamped 
shackles on his wrists and ankles 24 years ago and hauled him off 
to angola state prison to be executed 
but the big roughhewn electric chair where sinclair was 
supposed to pay the penalty for murder didnt get him 
instead the appeals process dragged on so long sinclair wound 
up among hundreds of condemned men who lucked out when the us 
supreme court decreed in 1972 that death penalty laws were 
unconstitutional 
in louisiana all death sentences of that day were reduced to 
life in prison without parole though the law was rewritten and 
reinstated it could not apply to them 
angolas dixie mafia didnt get him either when 14 years later 
he broke one of the great crooked commandments thou shalt not 
snitch to the cops 
the dixie mafia is described by louisiana state police as a 
loosely connected group of traveling thugs who are prone to 
violence and operate primarily in the southeast it should not be 
confused with moresophisticated organized crime syndicates 
so here sinclair stands today at age 45 6foot2 in his 
favorite pointytoed cowboy boots too lucky to perish in the 
copper clasp of old smokey too quick for the dixie mafia too 
felonious to be a free man 
in the years between his two abortive escape attempts he 
managed quite a career he was one of the most upwardly mobile 
lifers in custody 
determined to get out of work in the field or the kitchen he 
read his way to the top evolving into a hotshot jailhouse lawyer 
and coeditor of the prizewinning prison magazine the monthly 
angolite 
as a writer his articles won the george polk award and the 
silver gavel from the american bar association no small potatoes 
in the news business 
he even got married since he figured the warden would forbid 
such goings on at angola he didnt ask in a style befitting a 
smart jailhouse lawyer it was done by document a notorized 
statement designated a proxy to stand in for him 
the bride a baton rouge tv reporter he met at the prison while 
she was covering a death penalty story 
it was very unromantic his wife jodie sinclair recalls 
it took place on june 9 1982 in the office of a courthouse 
clerk in texas my brotherinlaw stood as billys proxy 
somewhere along the way this fourtime loser convicted of 
murdering a store manager during a 1965 holdup in baton rouge grew 
a shiny new set of ethics these even led him to become gulp a 
friend of the feds 
his secret dealings with the fbi in 1986 still echo at the 
18000acre plantationstyle prison and triggered a disapproving 
new york times editorial and a critical article in the columbia 
journalism review 
his sin he told the fbi that the thenchairman of the state 
pardon board howard marsellus jr was selling the gold seals 
that every prisoner yearns for 
gold seal is prison slang for the governors signature 
approving a pardon board recommendation that a sentence be reduced 
the state seal applied when the governor signs is gold in color 
in tipping the fbi to the scam sinclair decided the 
investigation was more important than the prison magazine where he 
was coeditor the times editorial said 
word that sinclair had become a snitch shattered the 
magazines credibility and left its remaining staffers faced with 
skeptical readers and sources the editorial added 
sinclair is big hawknosed his eyes wary and hooded though he 
no longer writes for the magazine the knock on his journalistic 
ethics troubles him and he glumly considers the possibility that 
his switch to honesty wont pay any better than crime 
so far what it got for him was an emergency transfer out of a 
dangerous prison to the placid and relatively comfortable state 
police barracks in baton rouge 
sinclair looked back on his last prison crisis recently in an 
interview at the barracks 
rumors that pardons were for sale had been rampant at the prison 
for months sinclair said that at the time it was just another 
layer of the prison corruption that he had been complaining about 
to the department of corrections for months with no reaction 
confirmation of the pardons scam didnt come until a prison 
official took him off to one side and told him he could buy his way 
out for 15000 
he said maybe it might be as much as 20000 it depended on 
the level of howards greed sinclair said he said howard was 
a greedy man

the offer upset him he was certain it was designed to make him 
dirty incriminate him or eliminate him as a threat of 
exposure simply killing him would have brought on too much 
attention he said 
i had one of three choices he said i could have accepted 
it and been a free man my wife and i had that much money i could 
have ignored the offer or i could report it 
acceptance went against his new ethics ignoring or reporting it 
was like blundering into a mine field 
the course available to a journalist on the outside was closed 
he couldnt develop the information and print it in the magazine as 
an expose the angolite had a degree of independence but editors 
still had to watch their step 
and he didnt even know which officials were dirty or clean 
there were a lot of inmates in that prison who had big money 
tied up in marsellus he said if they knew that i knew i 
would have been a dead man pure and simple 
he and his wife conferred by telephone 
the only question was we didnt know who to turn to i dont 
even know who the hell is involved i know i am fixing to step on 
some big toes if i give information to the wrong one im a dead 
man he said 
when they decided the only safe route was the federal 
government jodie called a cousin us rep bill archer dtexas 
he contacted the department of justice 
four days later justice called jodie would she work with fbi 
agents in a sting operation would she wear a tiny microphone 
hidden beneath her clothing so agents could record contract 
negotiations she would 
however the fbi recordings and videotapes never saw the light 
of a courtroom because the federal sting was superceded by a state 
police sting that started a few days later and finished first 
the state sting swept up marsellus plus a surprise catch state 
rep joe delpit of baton rouge assistant speaker of the house and 
political pal of gov edwin edwards 
only marsellus stayed hooked he served 20 months on concurrent 
fiveyear sentences for public bribery and conspiracy and federal 
charges of mail fraud and conspiracy 
delpits defense at his 1988 state court trial was that he was 
conducting his own sting investigation of pardon peddling rumors 
when he took 20000 from the state police undercover agent he 
wept on the witness stand 
the jury found him innocent of charges of bribery corrupt 
influencing and conspiracy 
district attorney bryan bush was not happy but as far as im 
concerned the case is over he said we all have to live with 
the jurys verdict 
sinclair testified before both the state and federal grand 
juries in the investigation with his role now public his life was 
in danger 
us attorney ray lamonica of baton rouge first notified prison 
officials to protect sinclair because he was a federal witness the 
prisonwise sinclair said the pressure only increased 
i started seeing more and more of those people who had 
connections with the dixie mafia in my vicinity which was 
unusual he said 
i had the definite feeling that i was being watched so i could 
be set up for a hit they were trying to get my movements down pat 
so they would be able to pick the right place in the prison where 
nobody would see me being done in 
when jodie passed this information on to lamonica he ordered 
two federal marshals to angola to take sinclair out 
you cant secondguess on something like that lamonica said 
sinclair said he never made any attempt to work a deal as a 
reward for helping the investigations in fact he said the fbi 
cautioned him at the start that he probably was killing any chance 
of a commutation of sentence 
he plans to file a new plea in march seeking a gold seal but he 
and jodie both assume the chances are slim to none 
i dont believe billy will ever come home jodie says 
some people say we should have paid the money a friend of mine 
says if this had happened in mexico i could have paid the money and 
thought nothing of it 
my passion now is to put it all on the record she says 
were writing a book 276 pages so far i mailed it off to an 
agent in new york last week

it rattles through vistas of empty desert past 
encampments of goathair bedouin tents past ruined ottoman 
watering stations built of stone past the relics of wrecked 
trains a ride on the hejaz railway is a nostalgic trip through an 
arabia of long ago 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
railway carriages that escaped lawrence 
of arabias desert raids in world war i are again clattering along 
the old hejaz railway built by the ottomans last caliph to carry 
pilgrims to mecca 
the peeling wood and rattling windows of the 80yearold 
carriages testify to the history of the line and to the regional 
turmoil that has kept modernization at bay 
jordan and syria resumed a weekly service on the 138mile 
stretch between amman and damascus in october after an eightyear 
interruption 
the engines are modern diesels but the belgianbuilt carriages 
and most of the track are the ones that were used when the line was 
built 
they are some of the oldest still in use for a regular passenger 
service rather than as a tourist attraction 
theres no other one like it says friedrich pichler a 
widely traveled austrian railroad consultant who made the 
eighthour trip to damascus just to ride the train when you 
travel on this railroad its like people felt in the 20s 
the fare too can prompt nostalgia about 350 for first class 
and 210 for second class 
the turkish sultan abdelhamid conceived the line to ferry 
moslem pilgrims on the annual hajj or pilgrimage to mecca 
birthplace of the prophet mohammed as well as to cement his rule 
over the ottoman empires restive arab provinces 
construction on the germanengineered line started in 1900 in 
damascus it ended in medina in what is now saudi arabia eight 
years and 810 miles later 
the turks matched a unique 105centimeter narrow gauge used 
accidentally on an earlier french line from beirut to damascus 
it should have been 1065 millimeters but someone cut the 
track supports to the wrong width and for reasons of saving money 
it was decided to build the line to fit them instead of sending for 
new ones says geoffrey freeman allen editor of janes world 
railways in london 
turmoil in turkey and the outbreak of world war i ended plans to 
extend the line to mecca 
and marauding arab rebels accompanied by the british officer 
te lawrence the legendary lawrence of arabia repeatedly 
raided the line during the war to block turkish supplies 
british maj sir hubert young who accompanied lawrence later 
wrote nothing seemed to give him greater pleasure than to squat 
down less than 200 yards from the railway line and watch with 
complete unconcern the slow approach of a train full of turkish 
soldiers 
as soon as the engine was over the undiscovered mine he would 
jam down the knob of the exploder retire to his waiting camel and 
ride away hotly pursued by the fire of any soldiers who might have 
escaped from the rear carriages 
damaged bridges and wrecked trains derailed by lawrence 
remarkably preserved in the dry desert air can still be found 
along the old line mainly in southern jordan and saudi arabia 
where passenger service on the hejaz stopped years ago 
the track that once carried pious pilgrims now ferries phosphate 
on rebuilt lines through southern jordan to the port of aqaba 
the original track north of amman forces engineers to hold 
speeds to 31 mph on straight stretches and 21 mph on curves as the 
train traces the edge of the vast arabian desert 
it rattles through empty vistas of arid land past encampments 
of goathair bedouin tents fragrant with brushwood smoke from fires 
for brewing tea past ruined ottoman watering stations built of 
stone 
in towns the rare passage of a train briefly halts normal life 
men and women wave from balconies soccer players interrupt 
their games mobs of shrieking children dance and race the 
hornblaring train and sometimes even throw stones at it 
the trip is still a novelty as well to the unusually friendly 
customs and immigration officials 
at the syrian entry station of deraa no bankers awaited 
foreigners for the mandatory exchange of currency 
so cheerful police packed the only two westerners into the back 
of a jeep and raced them 3 miles to an exchange post the officers 
had to pushstart their vehicle on the return leg 
the future of the eccentric service is in doubt however 
history is at war with economics 
railroad officials say it would be too expensive to renovate the 
weatherbeaten wooden cars whose squeaking wall panels sometimes 
wiggle independently of their neighbors 
the odd small size of the track also makes it impossible to 
carry much freight or trains from standardgauge tracks used 
elsewhere 
marwan hadawi general director of syrias branch of the 
railroad says damascus is already preparing the roadbed for a new 
standardgauge track to the jordanian border 
the syrians also are considering using more modern hungarian 
passenger cars to replace the ancient belgian cars on the run to 
amman the hungarian cars already serve damascus and deraa daily 
a 1981 study by german consultants proposed replacing the whole 
system with a modern standardgauge line but the 3 billion to 4 
billion price tag means that project is at best far in the future

every year dozens of children are shot down on 
the mean streets of detroit and other cities now the mothers of 
some of the victims are fighting back staging antiviolence 
demonstrations and providing support groups for others who have 
lost a child through an organization called save our sons and 
daughters 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
derik barfields life went largely unnoticed by 
the public and at first so did his death 
shot with a handgun during an argument in which a brother was 
critically wounded his slaying on july 17 1986 rated three short 
paragraphs in the next days edition of the detroit free press 
it was not a spectacular murder by detroit standards after all 
30 other city youths 18 or younger were shot to death that year 
today derik barfields funeral program is one of a dozen tacked 
to a cork board in a cluttered office in a centuryold schoolhouse 
near the cass corridor detroits skid row 
on another wall are twodozen plaques including one etched with 
his name and those of the 30 other youths killed by gunfire in 1986 
this is the parttime office of clementine barfield 38 who 
helped found an organization called save our sons and daughters 
several months after the death of the third of her four children 
shes a busy woman this morning 
plans for a weeklong antiviolence program at martin luther 
king high school and a neighborhood antidrug march are in the 
works 
in the afternoon she will accompany another mother to a state 
juvenile prison to visit the young killer of the womans son she 
wants to talk to him and help him get his life straightened out 
barfield says 
we are people who have been through hell ourselves but we are 
willing to put it aside take a stand and say we have got to do 
something she adds 
at the core of sosad is barfield and six other mothers of slain 
youths who organized the group in early 1987 with about 90 other 
detroiters citizen volunteers clergy and city and school 
officials have joined in sosads dual purpose of comforting 
grieving families and working to prevent violence by and against 
the citys children 
in the black community bereavement support is not something 
we normally reach out for barfield says the norm is for 
people to lock themselves in their house and feel like theyre the 
only one who feels this badly but we have over 130 families in 
sosad families that have reached out 
sosad provides weekly support groups workshops on grief stress 
management classes and a 24hour hot line 
the organization also holds an antihandgun vigil every monday 
at the citycounty building and has sponsored rallies marches and 
memorial services 
wherever i go kids are stopping me and saying youre that 
lady about the kids getting killed says barfield who also 
works full time in the city finance department 
sosad is developing chapters in flint and pontiac it has had 
requests for organizational help from milwaukee st louis 
atlanta los angeles san francisco columbus ohio and omaha neb 
soon we will be a national organization or rather other 
people will start their own chapters barfield says if they 
call themselves sosad theyll be looking to us for organization 
and i dont want to take on all that right now we dont have the 
resources 
sosad is sustained mainly by small donations and grants from the 
state and city the group has yet to receive corporate or 
foundation support 
grassroots organizations usually are started by people who 
have a lot of love and a lot of commitment but it doesnt know how 
to sustain itself barfield says without money the group will 
die out but our emphasis has never been on money our emphasis is 
on commitment 
barfield said her own commitment hasnt flagged but shes had 
to begin picking and choosing her activities for example she no 
longer attends funerals something she used to do two or three 
times a week 
ive heard so many crying mothers seen so many dead 
children she says after a while all the faces started to 
look alike the pain is the same the hurt is the same 
i dont want to keep looking at that i want to look at 
solutions look at alternatives 
solutions if any are hard to assess 
from jan 1 through nov 12 of 1989 there were 229 shootings of 
detroit children 16 or under 28 of them fatal according to police 
statistics there were 308 such shootings 55 of them fatal for 
all of 1988 
its kind of hard to measure the impact barfield says 
but when you look at the statistics and see homicides among young 
people are going down you have to feel encouraged and its not 
just because of sosad 
sosad has worked only indirectly with the detroit police 
department says cmdr dorothy knox head of the departments 
community services division but the group has been an important 
influence on other community organizations she says 
you have to start somewhere and if it gets the public up in 
arms then its meeting its purpose knox says 
jesse harrison who shot derik barfield between the eyes with a 
handgun he bought for 25 spent slightly more than two years in a 
state prison and was released in december 1988 
i cant heal as long as im talking about it every day so the 
healing process is not just something i can work through 
clementine barfield says but i know ive been instrumental in 
helping some children and it helps to know i havent lost my son 
for nothing 
sosads dual purpose of support for bereaved families and 
antiviolence advocacy may be unique in the united states says 
marjolijn bijlefeld associate director of the washington 
dcbased coalition to stop gun violence 
i dont know of anyone like clem barfield who has taken it on 
and continued long after other parents have quit a support group 
bijlefeld says 
the coalition itself tried without success to start a support 
network for grieving families she said 
people who are willing to talk about it generally are very 
willing to talk about it immediately afterward she says but 
its hard to sustain it people who have lost a child seven or 
eight years ago dont always want to keep going with it theres a 
lot of attrition 
i cant afford to burn out barfield says i have to keep 
the fire burning but im pushing for others to pick up the torch

scuba divers have a lot of things to explore 
from coral reefs to shipwrecks oil rigs to underground caves but 
an abandoned mine yes right in the heart of the midwest a 
nowflooded lead mine is beckoning divers with a different kind of 
scenery 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
far beneath the general store and the 
gas station in this little midwestern town lies a water wonderland 
scuba diving a sport usually associated with the tropics has 
come to missouri and the billion gallon lake resort converted 
from a longabandoned lead mine may be its most unusual attraction 
its like diving through a ghost town or a shipwreck says 
scuba instructor doug goergens who along with his wife cathy 
owns the flooded mine now billed as the largest freshwater dive 
resort in the world or like soaring through a cathedral its an 
aweinspiring experience 
goergens superlatives can be discounted to a certain extent 
since he has a vested interest he says hes invested about 1 
million in the project 
but jacques cousteaus son jean michel was impressed the son 
of the man credited as being one of the inventors of scuba 
selfcontained underwater breathing apparatus in the 1940s gave 
the resort rave reviews 
and skin diver magazine has touted the mine as a time capsule 
an engineering marvel and an unbeatable weekend getaway 
bonne terre or good earth in french is a town of about 
3500 people about 60 miles south of st louis last year the mine 
tapped into the landlocked midwestern scuba market for relatively 
lowcost weekendonly forays attracting 15000 customers 
the lake was formed when the owners of st joseph mining co 
once the provider of jobs to 5000 closed operations and shut off 
the water pumps natural seepage of spring and rainwater flooded 
the mine 
marian rivman a spokeswoman for the diving equipment 
manufacturers association an organization that monitors the 
industry says bonne terre is unique 
people are diving everywhere says rivman known in the 
industry as the scuba lady but inland theres nothing 
comparable to the mine its a great destination 
beauty of course is in the eye of the beholder and the avid 
scuba fan has other attractions to explore in the united states 
among them shipwrecks off the coast of north carolina oil rigs in 
the gulf of mexico or the kelp forests of california 
the florida keys are perhaps the prime us destination for the 
estimated 265 million active scuba divers in the united states 
offering warm water coral and fish divers also can investigate 
lakes quarries and rivers although visibility often is severely 
limited 
such is the case at lake norfork ark a 500mile round trip 
from st louis where goergens used to take his scuba students 
diving can be very very inconvenient goergens says 
hes put a lot of work into removing that negative aspect at the 
bonne terre operation illuminating the mine with 300000 watts of 
lighting and installing showers and locker rooms 
the mine once the worlds largest producer of lead has the 
craggy look of a lunar landscape jackhammers silent since the mine 
closed in 1961 jut out of solid rock scattered picks shovels 
ladders and helmets also were left behind and their presence adds 
to the surreal surroundings 
the lake is pale blue and crystal clear with visibility more 
than 100 feet in lighting conditions goergens describes as late 
afternoon although it appears to be closer to dusk 
unlike other diving environs the subterranean lake is devoid of 
life forms no sharks to worry about here and other distractions 
such as current surges or tidal rushes a constant water 
temperature of 58 degrees a little chilly but bearable in a wet 
suit makes it a yearround resort 
when goergens first dived in the mine in 1974 he described it as 
a dark scary place he saw potential though as a training 
ground for the 1200 to 1500 students his st louis company west 
end diving centers certifies annually 
it has turned out to be much more to accommodate the divers 
that now flock to bonne terre the goergenses renovated a mansion 
once owned by the president of the mine and turned it into a 
country inn they also transformed an old ramshackle train depot 
into a saloon and bedandbreakfast inn and their work in part 
has sparked renewed interest in tourism on the part of civic 
leaders 
goergens who opened the mine to the public in 1981 believes 
more wonders may be in store there are now 24 trails to explore 
but only four of the 17 miles of flooded tunnels which would allow 
the entire town of bonne terre to fit inside have been developed 
so far

it wasnt a cowboy who first wrote that someone 
bit the dust thats from homers iliad but americas 
riders of the range are beginning to let others know that they 
too have a way with words thanks in large part to an annual 
gathering of cowboy poets in nevada 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
cowboy poets who once practiced their art mainly in bunkhouses 
and bars and at family gatherings have extended their stage across 
america in recent years appearing on national television and the 
banquet circuit 
cowboy poetry has existed as long as there have been cowboys 
several old songs began as cowboy verse and the earliest books of 
cowboy poems were published as early as the 19th century 
but it didnt really attract a wide audience until january 1985 
when hal cannon former state folklorist in utah organized with 
several others the cowboy poets gathering in elko nev now an 
annual event held every january 
cowboy poetry was a part of american folklore but it had 
almost no exposure says cannon who has become the director of 
the western folk life center in salt lake city america didnt 
know about the poetic cowboy 
so we all started thinking about it we started looking around 
our own states and found that almost everyone who interprets the 
cowboy is an outsider movie makers tv producers journalists 
artists folklorists 
the cowboy hadnt really had a chance to tell his own story 
he really didnt have a public forum 
baxter black of henderson colo considered to be the only such 
poet who derives his entire income from rhyme says audiences find 
western poetry enchanting because of the cowboys independent image 
he has a physical job black says hes outdoors hes 
placing himself against the elements with the mythical code of the 
west to guide him when the chips are down this is the person you 
want to stand beside you 
black who has traveled the banquet circuit for years with 
stopovers in such places as muleshoe texas says acceptance from 
the general public began with that first poetry gathering in elko 
before the poets went public cannon says the only place you 
really heard them was in bars or cow camps they were pretty 
private sessions 
cowboys and ranchers first published their poetic works as early 
as 1880 he says but it just never got out to the public 
the public exposure has brought out several hundred other 
cowboy poets some better than others 
the quality ranges from bad to great cannon says 
buck ramsey of amarillo texas one of the newcomers to the 
cowboy poet circle is considered by cannon to be one of the best 
when i hear buck ramsey recite his poetry im much more moved 
than when i see someone throw his hat all around the stage 
cannon says 
performance which includes gestures facial expressions and 
tone of voice sometimes overshadows the content at cowboy poetry 
readings 
ramseys verse is straightforward with no histrionics asked for 
a couplet about a cowboy poet ramsey replied 
hed do to ride the river with 
id have you say of me 
and if i lived to fit the words 
id be all i should be 
waddy mitchell a ranch foreman near elko who also has found 
national prominence as a cowboy poet estimates participation since 
the first gathering has increased 2000 percent 
mitchell has appeared on several television specials and toured 
recently with country singer michael martin murphy to places like 
marthas vineyard mass and miami 
black who acts as his own business manager and limits his 
appearances off the banquet circuit to about five a year has been 
a guest on the johnny carson show twice 
other poets have begun to fill in as headliners at dinners 
banquets and conventions throughout the west 
cannon is preparing an anthology of cowboy poetry that will 
include some of ramseys work 
ramsey injured in a broncriding accident on a texas panhandle 
ranch in 1963 has written nonfiction for southwestern 
publications for years he believes many cowboys are far 
bettereducated in literature than most people realize 
some of the cowboy language comes from such classics as homers 
the iliad 
homer referred to a breaker of horses 56 times in his classic 
work ramsey says it also produced the term bit the dust 
the bull durham classics also supplemented the cowboys 
literary understanding 
back before the turn of the century you could send a dime off 
with a tag off a bull durham tobacco sack and get one of the 303 
classics ramsey says the set included all of the great 
literature from homer up through the american writers 
ramsey wrote poems as a young cowboy along the canadian river 
breaks 
in later years i would see someone like baxter or waddy on tv 
saying their poems and the old poems were running through my mind 
after i saw them i decided to write my poems down 
ramsey mitchell says is a jewel of a guy and a good 
storyteller and a pretty good guitar picker

elke sommer the glamorous germanborn actress 
who has appeared in more than 60 movies once wouldnt tolerate any 
distractions while she was on the stage 
that was before she made her new york acting debut in the title 
role of tamara a play in which she moves about the seventh 
regiment armory with the audience in somewhat noisy pursuit 
tamara a glamorous parisian artist arrives at an italian 
patriotpoets villa in 1927 to paint him then finds that he is a 
fascist and a seducer 
not only do the 10 actors playing the villas residents travel 
from room to room but the audience sweeps along behind them going 
hither or thither depending on which character theyve decided to 
follow 
the main floor of the seventh regiment armory serves as the 
villas main hall dining room and tamaras bedroom upstairs are 
other bedrooms and in the basement are the kitchen and servants 
quarters quiet its not 
at times there have been a book fair antique show and soldiers 
marching in other parts of the armory 
the audience standing in the same room with the actors 
sometimes jump in 
yesterday sommer says i said luisa luisa a little 
boy pulled on my coat there she is i said gee thanks i was 
crying in one scene and a lady gave me her handkerchief i took it 
im an actor who if there is any noise or distractions i go 
insane and have screaming fits now i could work on a battlefield 
sommer who joined the cast of tamara two weeks before its 
dec 2 second anniversary has made more than 60 movies including 
a shot in the dark the money trap the art of love and 
the oscar 
she calls herself a workaholic once i didnt work for two 
months and i thought nobody wants me any more a week later 
something came and i complained again oh no eight shows a 
week if i know i have something ahead im fine 
she worked hard in school studying latin and greek teaching 
old languages and history would have interested me but both would 
have taken many more semesters and we had no money she says i 
decided i would learn modern languages and go into the diplomatic 
service 
to polish her english she went to england as an au pair the 
family moved to italy and asked her to help with the children while 
they settled in 
i got invited by a boy to go dancing one night she recalls 
vittorio de sicas righthand man saw me 
i didnt have any desire to be an actress nor was i the 
slightest bit lured by whatever glamour people think there is i 
was going to go back to germany and take russian 
de sica put her in a friend of the jaguar a comedy he 
directed then in a comedy he starred in men and noblemen it 
took six weeks 
i thought it was a silly way to make a living sommer says 
somebody saw a picture of me in a paper in berlin a german 
girl in italy he flew down and offered me a threepicture 
contract then it was back to italy for three movies to england 
for one more to france for three more then i did the victors 
for carl foreman it was shot in europe but was the first american 
picture i did with an allstar cast 
i always looked with one eye on the possibility of going back 
to the university for a long time when i had spent nearly three 
years in the business i thought my goodness this is going to be 
your work youd better do something about it i took voice 
lessons 
sommer was brought to america for the price with paul 
newman she and sharon tate were clad beautifully and had very 
little acting to do in the wrecking crew 
i was always supposed to be glamorous which is a big pain in 
the neck she says everybody expects this wonderfully groomed 
person to come out which is not me at all its a terrible effort 
every time 
i just finished f14 in which i play a farm lady without any 
makeup its a story about a frenchgerman bullet train thats 
going to destroy the last bit of beauty we have 
i love my job with my soul and heart but only since i started 
doing stage work 19 years ago sommer says she has frequently 
acted at the drury lane in chicago winning the jefferson award for 
born yesterday she also has toured in plays in america and 
germanspeaking europe 
in 1964 sommer married author joe hyams the first person who 
interviewed her in america three years ago she was pregnant with 
twins and lost them

think she says 
she and hyams are now separated

unlike the naive hollywood agent he plays on 
the famous teddy z jon cryer knows a thing or two about show 
business 
in the cbs comedy series cryers character teddy zakalokis 
went overnight from a job in the mailroom at an ad agency to become 
a big talent agent its a fluke teddy hasnt a clue how it 
happened he doesnt know how to take a meeting or do 
lunch and as far as he knows cma and caa are government agencies 
rather than talent agencies 
cryer on the other hand was born into a show business family 
and was virtually raised backstage prior to the debut of the 
series in september cryer had starred on broadway and in movies 
i grew up backstage and was fascinated by it cryer says 
i felt at home backstage i felt at home working on the stage i 
loved being in the theater people were always flamboyant 
interesting and intelligent 
cryers father david cryer starred on broadway in evita as 
well as 1776 his mother gretchen cryer is a playwright and 
actress she wrote and starred in im getting my act together and 
taking it on the road and has a new musical for 1991 
my parents didnt want me to be an actor they wanted me to be 
a professional so i could count on making a living they went 
through a lot of tough times before making it 
its also been a shaky ride for the famous teddy z created 
by hugh wilson the man behind wkrp in cincinnati and franks 
place its the lowestrated of the cbs monday night shows none 
of which regularly make the top 20 in the nielsen list 
this week was the shows last appearance on monday night cbs 
said it would return soon in a new time slot 
the shows taken some hysterical jabs at hollywood alex roccos 
portrayal of a frantic grasping agent is so funny that several 
real agents have claimed they are the model still it may be too 
inside for most of the audience and historically series with a 
show business background have not done well 
the series is loosely based on the early career of jay kanter a 
motion picture executive who began as an agent he went from the 
mailroom at a major talent agency to agent after he was sent to 
pick up marlon brando at the airport and the actor took a liking to 
him which is what happens to teddy when he has to pick up actor 
harland keyvo 
the difference is that kanter was not the naive kid that teddy 
is cryer says i met him when he was the head of mgm a few 
years ago 
on the show teddy is intimidated by his secretary played by 
jane sibbett shes a collegeeducated aspiring agent who was his 
rival when they were both in the mailroom at the agency 
she knows what shes doing says cryer shes better 
suited for the job than he is 
in real life cryer and sibbett have been dating for the past 
nine months 
teddys becoming a little less naive he says but hell 
always be the innocent among the sharks theyre also allowing him 
to be a little more funny rather than having just the people 
around him be funny 
in the fall cryer and his father a regular on the soap opera 
as the world turns did a joint photo session in new york for 
their cbs shows 
we did work together once in a benefit for the mirror 
repertory in new york cryer says im not much of a singer 
but dads a wonderful singer i didnt want to turn him down since 
it was a fatherson theme of course dad forgot the words 
on the same occasion he also acquired the fake nose derek jacobi 
wore in a production of cyrano de bergerac 
it was in the benefit auction he says i didnt want to 
bid but my father nudged me and said one of the rockefellers was in 
the audience and he wasnt going to be outbid by a 19yearold it 
cost me 500 i have it on a bookshelf with a spotlight on it 
cryer attended the royal academy of the dramatic arts in london 
during his high school vacations he made his broadway debut in 
brighton beach memoirs in his senior year his film debut was 
oc and stiggs and his first starring role was opposite demi 
moore in no small affair hes also starred in pretty in 
pink superman iv hiding out and dudes 
before the series hed done some television an episode of 
amazing stories and the american playhouse production of noon

today is sunday jan 21 the 21st day of 1990 there are 344 
days left in the year 
todays highlight in history 
on jan 21 1793 king louis xvi of france was executed by the 
guillotine 
on this date 
in 1861 jefferson davis of mississippi and four other 
southerners resigned from the us senate 
in 1908 new york city enacted an ordinance that made smoking in 
public by women punishable by a fine of 5 to 25 and up to ten 
days imprisonment 
in 1915 the first kiwanis club was founded in detroit

powers boothe says he saw his role as john 
walker jr in cbss family of spies the walker spy ring as a 
man who sold out his country for the money 
over two decades walkers espionage organization provided 
enough secrets to moscow to change the balance of power between the 
soviet union and the united states defense analysts say 
his pattern didnt fit into any normal patterns for 
espionage said boothe of the former navy communications 
specialist he walked into the soviet embassy in washington and 
volunteered his services he wasnt recruited he wasnt mad at the 
government or the military he just did it for the money i always 
thought spies were politically motivated his motivation was greed 
it was the american dream gone awry 
walker said i served my government very well and the soviet 
government very well i think after a number of years he convinced 
himself his actions were making the world a safer place but i 
think it was just a business with him 
the twopart fivehour miniseries which also stars lesley ann 
warren as walkers wife barbara will be telecast by cbs on sunday 
and tuesday stephen gyllenhaal directed from a screenplay by 
richard delong adams based on two books family of spies inside 
the john walker spy ring by pete earley and i pledge allegiance 
by howard blum 
it begins in 1967 when walker was a senior chief petty officer 
working in communications aboard the submarine uss john paul jones 
in charleston sc over the years he recruited his best friend 
his brother and a son as he lived a playboy lifestyle with his 
agents in place walker retired from the navy and also divorced his 
wife 
boothe said he believed walker recruited his son in order to 
give him a legacy walker found stealing secrets so easy he said 
convenience stores had tighter security 
it was filmed with limited cooperation from the navy despite 
its embarrassment to the service the production company did not go 
aboard any ships but ships at the long beach naval station were 
used as a backdrop 
the miniseries was also filmed partly on location in vienna 
austria the city is a gathering place for spies and is especially 
popular with russians boothe said walker went there frequently 
i firmly believe that if his wife had not thought he had 
failed to pay her some money he owed her hed still be doing it 
said boothe she turned him in no one was on to him 
although walker was a traitor boothe didnt play him as a 
villain 
you have to put aside your personal feelings he said as 
an actor you have to convince people youre not a bad person if i 
played walker as dark and evil he wouldnt be believable and people 
would lose interest 
walker was very smart very charming and somewhat paranoid he 
was extremely efficient and everyone liked him in port everyone 
wanted to go where he went because he knew all the good places he 
said the only chink in his armor was his wife it turned out to be 
true 
boothe won an emmy for portraying another evil and tragic 
character the rev jim jones in the 1980 tv movie guyana 
tragedy the story of jim jones jones was a charismatic cult 
leader who persuaded 900 of his followers to commit mass suicide in 
the 1970s 
he starred as private eye philip marlowe in 11 episodes of 
chandlertown made for hbo in england and canada based on short 
stories by raymond chandler 
he will also be seen in the hbo movie grand tour which he 
described as a modern day failsafe james earl jones martin 
landau and rebecca demornay also star 
a missile is launched from turkey toward russia he said 
they launch a small strike toward us the soviet premier calls 
the american president and tells him the strike was launched by 
dissidents protesting glasnost but can he be trusted 
i play the commander of a group of b52 bombers the movie is 
really about each mans decision do you go ahead or not knowing 
the world is about to be blown up

halloween 5 the revenge of michael myers cbsfox home 
video vhsbeta rated r for rental market 
 
this is a really inferior film 
like others of the teenage sliceanddice genre halloween 
5 requires a knowledge of the series to know whats going on it 
never really suggests what the heck it is michaels avenging 
no great loss for the cinematic slaughter of sexually 
precocious teenagers has become as stylized as jacobean tragedy 
halloween 5 is set in the curiously empty suburb that has 
more than its share of nubile teenagers with too much disposable 
income it opens with a flashback of michael being run over by a 
car and blown down a handy abandoned mineshaft his chest full of 
buckshot from the shotguns of the neverprompt police 
one year later the subtitle says and we dissolve to 
waiflike 9yearold jamie a traumatic mute and inmate of the local 
home for disturbed children she is reliving the psychological 
domination of michael her uncle and um psychic twin that drove 
her to juke her stepmommy in the bathtub 
her visitors are perky attractive teenage girls who are 
friends or relatives or something blithely preparing for a teen 
halloween party 
thats right a halloween party in a town that has seen so much 
annual slaughter on the night that anywhere else the streets would 
be crowded with police national guardsmen and reporters angling 
for the haddonfield one year after slaughter story 
ah but were not here for logic were here for the numbingly 
predictable series of false starts cheap frights and intermittent 
painstakingly overdubbed stabbings that lead up to michaels real 
horror 
in 5 as in 1 2 3 and 4 michaels task is 
to murder teenagers who indulge in casual sex thats the point of 
this movie kids make love and you die kiss kiss hack hack 
stab chop die 
this is the 1990s though and the socially responsible 
filmmakers of halloween 5 give us this line at an intimate 
moment she says i didnt bring anything and he 
produces a condom 
halloween 5 was written by michael jacobs shem bitterman 
and dominique otheningirard and directed by otheningirard maybe 
michael could go after them in halloween 6 
whats alarming about this unfrightening stupid teen screamer 
though is that its real heroine is a 9yearold girl and that 
means the makers of this product are relying on cable and the 
ubiquitous videocassette to get halloween 5 before an even 
younger audience 
now thats scary

long hard look atlantic lou gramm 
 
from a murmur to a scream lou gramm sings it all 
unfortunately there isnt much to scream about on long hard 
look the second solo effort from foreigners lead singer its 
passable rock n roll but thats about it 
most of this lp testifies only that the artist is overqualified 
for the job gramms powerful voice soars sighs and blasts what he 
calls positive aggression 
but if his voice were lifted out of these songs theyd only be 
good enough for a lowgrade beer commercial you cant make gold 
out of dross but you might make a gold album 
the rockers on long hard look sound calculated to appeal to 
teenagers theyre all swagger and no substance just like a high 
school jock trying to impress the girls hangin on my hip is 
the worst offender complete with requisite macho man guitar solo 
histrionics 
so gramm tries hard to rock hard sometimes it takes more 
strength to be soft the ballads remember these are rock ballads 
shine brighter than the rockers just between you and me is 
already a top 5 single and warmest rising sun and true blue 
love also have potential 
on sun a koto gives a glint of japanese musical tradition 
in passages the voices of gramm and a choir including merry 
clayton and siedah garrett ascend in reverie like a sunrise it 
recalls the soulful depth gramm displayed on foreigners 1985 hit 
i want to know what love is 
gramm cowrote all but one of the songs with producer peter wolf 
not the peter wolf of the j geils band and others 
on long hard look gramm is a rock n roll thoroughbred 
running on a dog track it is hoped that his next effort whether 
solo or with foreigner will match some industrial strength 
material with his powerful voice

trouble walkin atlanticmegaforce ace frehley 
 
its fast its loud its ace frehley 
thats about all anyone needs to know about trouble walkin 
the exkissers latest album 
heres heavy metal for the kids many of whom werent even alive 
when frehley and kiss were at their glammetal peak for those who 
missed kiss platform bootkicking days trouble walkin 
features contributions from exkiss men peter criss the catfaced 
one and paul stanley the stareyed one 
criss lends backing vocals and percussion while stanley is 
cowriter of hide your heart its been 10 years since frehley 
the cometeyed one and criss last worked together 
trouble walkin might be hard rock but its tame compared 
to bands such as guns n roses metallica or iron maiden there 
isnt any devilworshiping hype gruesome cover art 
racisthomophobic lyrics or caterwauling vocals a la axl rose of 
the gunners 
frehley just wants to rock this town as he sings in shot 
full of rock 
he does it best on a cover of elos do ya 
frehley does a little double entendre in the cardplaying tale 
of five card stud and in the hymn to adolescent hormones 
back to school i grade on a curve 
hes got a couple of boyswithguns songs 2 young 2 die 
includes a cliched line about ripping down societys walls 
thatll probably appeal to alienated teens 
but he changes his tune with remember me a softer bluesy 
track the song has frehley joining rocks social consciousness 
bandwagon 
your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line and 
people keep on starving and they think thats just fine 
criticizes the heavenly narrator we need some loving and caring 
and kissing and hugging and helping each other 
who says you cant mix guns n hugs

it knocks you to your knees says robert 
loggia of the experience of filming a movie about the holocaust in 
the actual concentration camp where the atrocities took place 45 
years ago 
loggia appears with willem dafoe and edward james olmos in the 
new film triumph of the spirit based on the true story of a 
family of greek jews one of whom survived wartime horror by boxing 
for the sport of his nazi captors the producers were able to get 
permission to film at auschwitz 
it was a lifechanging experience for everyone said loggia 
i know what it was for me and i know what it was for virtually 
the entire cast 
i suppose having a glimpse into the nadir of mans soul tests 
your faith in man and his basic goodness which we all want to hold 
on to you say why did this happen 
in my lifetime i have heard all the stories my father was in 
world war i and i heard about the trenches and the gassing the 
killing the bayoneting im a student of history and i know the 
nature of our own civil war which was brutal brother against 
brother i was in the korean war myself although i didnt see 
action i followed the brutality of it and of vietnam the 
defoliation and the bombings 
man is a pretty miserable creature in the destruction he can 
vent on his fellow man the actor said so you say what made 
the holocaust so special perhaps it was the premeditated 
attempt for total genocide to wipe a culture and a people who have 
contributed so much to civilization perhaps per capita more than 
any other ethnic group 
in triumph of the spirit loggia plays the father of a 
salonika family descendants of sephardic jews expelled from spain 
500 years before in 1944 they were rounded up by the thousands 
and sent to concentration camps where most of them died 
we were shooting in the exact barrack where the events 
happened loggia recalled we were freezing in our prison 
uniforms and our wooden clogs filth and mud all about us it was 
so thoroughly recreated that you did recapitulate the actual 
event 
triumph of the spirit adds another chapter to loggias 
remarkable acting career that has ranged from dashing heroics as a 
disney leading man to status as one of the screens busiest 
character actors with a low period in between 
like all men and women there was a kind of middleage crisis 
in a danteesque sense he reflected midway in the walk of 
life you descend into hades and decide oh ill just climb back 
out of this inferno and take life rather than the pit of fire 
i went through that sure i think one of the residual 
benefits of being an actor comes if you can hang in and continue to 
grow as a person and not be a onetrick pony ill be 60 this 
month and i look forward to playing pops and grandpops and 
greatgrandpops why not keep going as long as you dont get a 
facelift and try to look like a juvenile 
im enjoying this part of my life enormously which is i 
guess saying i live in the present 
robert loggia was born on staten island in new york city to 
italian immigrants and first spoke italian at home he started out 
to be a newsman but switched to acting under the tutelage of the 
famed alvina krause at northwestern university after army duty he 
landed in new york and studied with stella adler his stage work 
brought hollywood offers and he starred for disney in the tv 
series the nine lives of elfego baca he later starred in the 
critically acclaimed adventure series the cat 
but his demand as a handsome leading man faded and loggia 
retreated to new york and his inferno period from 1968 to 1974 
he credits his emergence to a couple of plays for joseph papp 
wedding band with ruby dee and in the boomboom room with 
madeleine kahn 
i found that i still had something on the ball as an actor in 
both those plays he said i came back to la after a sixyear 
absence aiming to conconstitute my career i found it wasnt easy 
with absence theres a certain distrust is he a drinker did 
he live in a tree is he strange 
the only jobs he could find were guest heavies in episodic 
television usually a mafia guy in a nice suit that proved a 
dead end and he tried directing his first being a magnum 
pi then came an officer and a gentleman producers first 
saw his strength as a character actor and he followed with 
scarface the jagged edge academy nomination as supporting 
actor prizzis honor sob big and his current nbc 
series mancuso fbi

the music of german composer richard wagner a 
selfdeclared antisemite whose operas blared over loudspeakers in 
nazi death camps is taboo in israel 
but gottfried wagner maintains his greatgrandfathers work was 
exploited by the nazis and he is touring the jewish state to 
rectify what he calls the distorted image of the 19th century 
composer 
wagners message was exactly the opposite of what the nazis 
stood for said the 42yearold musicologist 
he added however that he empathized with jews who responded to 
the music with anguish and anger one of wagners greatest operatic 
achievements ring des nibelungen the ring of the 
nibelungen was loved by hitler who considered it a 
glorification of a master race throughout its history the rings 
story has been the subject of differing and often bizarre 
interpretations the music though is another matter 
an epic involving love and greed and gods and goddesses and 
performed in four operas das rheingold die walkure 
siegfried and gotterdammerung the ring is a tangled tale 
about the theft of a magic ring and the disasters of all who pursue 
it the score is heavy and compelling 
i understand completely if israelis reject wagner the 
composers greatgrandson said in an interview many jews went to 
their deaths in the camps while having to listen to his music 
his campaign including media interviews and a university 
lecture series has renewed debate on whether to rescind the 
unofficial boycott that has kept wagners operas off israels 
airwaves 
in the past all efforts to break the boycott have been met with 
stormy protest although many israelis say they listen to wagner at 
home 
when after a 1981 israel philharmonic orchestra concert 
conductor zubin mehta announced as an encore the prelude to the 
wagner opera tristan and isolde the audience cried shame 
an usher rushed to the stage pulled up his shirt to show 
naziinflicted scars and shouted play wagner on my body 
avi shoshani the orchestras general secretary said he 
regretted wagners music was still offlimits its a big loss 
our orchestra would have played it magnificently its a whole 
important segment in the history of music we are not touching he 
said 
but menahem fogel a spokesman for the yad vashem holocaust 
memorial in jerusalem said wagner should not be played as long as 
holocaust survivors are alive one has to consider the 
sensitivities of the people who lived through that period he 
said 
shai burstyn head of the musicology department at tel aviv 
university said richard wagner held antisemitic views although 
they should be seen in the context of the times 
im separating between the man and his music said burstyn 
whose department sponsored the lecture series there was hardly a 
19th century composer who was not an antisemite 
in an 1850 pamphlet titled the jew in music richard wagner 
railed against what he considered the undue influence of jews in 
germanys music circles 
the pamphlet is shameful but you cant draw a straight line 
from this to auschwitz gottfried wagner said he said his 
greatgrandfather was an ambitious man who lashed out because he 
felt the music establishment was withholding recognition of his 
achievements 
despite the prejudice expressed in the pamphlet the central 
message of his work especially of the operatic cycle the ring of 
the nibelung is one of hope wagner said 
he felt that men have to choose between love and destruction 
he hoped that future generations would learn from the mistakes of 
the past and opt for love not destruction wagner said 
this message was perverted when hitler a wagner enthusiast 
came to power 50 years after the composers death wagner said 
hitler befriended winifred wagner gottfrieds grandmother and a 
driving force at the bayreuth festival of wagnerian music during 
the third reich the nazi dictator and the wagner clan subsequently 
turned the composers operatic protagonists antiheroes who always 
met tragic ends into blond aryan monsters he said 
wagner said he distanced himself from the family early on he 
conducted research on german jewish culture and wrote a doctoral 
dissertation on germanjewish composer kurt weill he lives in 
cerro maggiore italy and also works as a stage and tv director 
he came to israel to begin a dialogue about his greatgrandfather 
howevever a matteroffact discussion about the composer might 
only be possible in another 20 years he said in the meantime he 
is not pushing too hard for an end of the wagner ban 
this is up to the israelis especially the victims of the 
holocaust wagner said

when suzanne vegas debut album came out in 
1985 her friend shawn colvin didnt want to hear it jealousy 
admittedly was the reason 
i respect her very much but at the time i was threatened and i 
didnt listen to her very closely recalled the 31yearold 
colvin a onetime backup singer for vega who now has a record of 
her own steady on 
when she made her first record i really kept a distance i was 
afraid in a way ill always be envious that she kind of broke this 
ground she was really a surprise a woman singersongwriter and 
she was very poetic 
colvin may have felt a twinge from any record she started 
performing at age 18 but took years to develop the confidence 
needed for making her debut album mental blocks and roadblocks got 
in the way 
she tried writing as a teenager but quickly discarded the 
material because she considered it immature then came years of 
touring bands and cities became a blur for the vermillion sd 
native all songwriters pay dues but colvin seemed afraid of 
reaping the benefits 
i felt very connected to the records that i had and the people 
i aspired to emulate but the reality was completely terrifying to 
me said colvin whose early heroes included joni mitchell and 
laura nyro 
as a result i joined different peoples bands and moved in 
different towns and never had the courage to keep progressing on my 
own it got too real and id lose my confidence 
the turning point she said came in 1983 in new york she quit 
drinking decided to perform solo and made several new friends 
including vega with whom she toured europe in fall 1987 upon 
returning colvin thought hard about what she wanted to do 
i had just come out night after night on stages in front of 
thousands of people and had a great time i was part of this wildly 
successful thing but i got home and i was nobody relatively 
speaking 
i would just sit up at night and smoke cigarettes and stare 
out into space i was really depressed but it was a really great 
time 
so after trips and stumbles colvin went to work she toured 
folk clubs around the east coast and in 1988 won the new york music 
award as best new vocalist she was signed by columbia records the 
same year 
steady on was coproduced by steve addabbo and john 
leventhal who shares writing credits on six of the records 10 
songs colvin plays acoustic guitar on each cut and the 
arrangements are a mix of folk rock and country 
she notes that vega who contributes backing vocals is a little 
jealous too insisting that colvin is the tougher artist 
shes certainly trying the title track of steady on is a 
message to herself a string tied around her finger i am gonna 
keep my head on straight colvin vows singing over an 
appropriately steady track laid down by leventhal 
in the story she insists that ill always be telling this 
story a powerful statement of purpose for a songwriter almost a 
declaration of principles 
diamond in the rough with its warning that theres 
nothing so cruel as to bury that jewel is her unofficial theme 
song a promise to never stay quiet 
when i was a kid it seemed that everywhere i turned around 
there was a lot of games being played at home in church at 
school she said her voice cracking slightly taking on a 
hurtful tone 
i just felt people were pretending i felt there was a lot of 
phoniness around me and it really bugged me i just felt oppressed 
by phoniness and i just wanted truth i had to find a way of 
expressing it and keep it hidden at the same time a lot of these 
songs are saying it doesnt have to be hidden anymore 
bless the meek heal the sick protect the weak colvin 
sings on the ballad dead of the night they were just words at 
first random thoughts scribbled on paper as mindlessly as signing 
for a registered letter thinking about it later colvin saw them 
as wishes reasons for spending hours alone in a dimly lighted room 
you see the bigger picture youre not in a room worrying 
about picking up your laundry you have this great feeling for 
energy or healing or desire for the world she said 
certainly if i didnt think i was doing something in 
songwriting besides just putting down my little petty feelings im 
sure i wouldnt do it i wouldnt have put a song like the story 
on a record if i didnt think i was writing for a lot of other 
people

tell john edgar wideman a story and he might 
forget it moments later its nothing personal though the author 
isnt a bad listener just a selective one accents and inflections 
sometimes interest him more than the words themselves 
but even if he doesnt always remember a good story wideman 
never fails to appreciate a story well told that means sentence 
rhythms the tone of voice evoking an entire world by a simple 
turn of phrase 
inspiration has come from professionals and amateurs alike 
authors james baldwin and zora neale hurston must share credit with 
members of widemans family such as his three aunts to whom 
fever 1695 henry holt a collection of 12 short stories 
is dedicated 
i believe that people develop very unusual capacities said 
wideman author of brothers and keepers and sent for you 
yesterday in a recent interview 
its often when one is stunted or lost or sometimes just 
because a person has a predeliction to that sense or ability i 
believe that very much i think its very important thematically in 
my work and intellectually overall being an afroamerican i had 
to be quite aware of a level of meaning below the words being 
spoken 
so wideman isnt kidding when he talks of bringing the bad news 
filling in grim details of stories he may have missed the first 
time around in the title story of fever he writes of a plague 
that swept philadelphia in the late 1700s and how blacks were 
blamed for the widespread illness 
that storys all about the fabled outside agitators who we 
always go after in the 20s the communists came from outside 
anarchists were crazy europeans from outside 
aids came from outside everything comes form outside you 
talk about civil rights its the people in the north thats the 
real problem i think 
wideman 49 emerged from the pittsburgh ghetto of homewood the 
setting for his trilogy damballah hiding place and sent 
for you yesterday winner of the penfaulkner award in 1984 he 
attended the university of pennsylvania and his first novel a 
glance away was published in 1967 
his books read like old scratchy 78s words seem to hiss and 
pop the language is deliberately crude separate and unequal but 
by no means inferior to official prose wideman has learned 
from his grandfather another nonwriter about the way with words 
i didnt like to go to stores with my grandfather because he 
spoke in a southern rural halting way i didnt know that he just 
used that accent at times i wasnt aware of the kind subtlety 
when hed go pick up a pair of shoes and ask the man how much 
they cost he knew how much the damned things cost he could read 
the prices he couldnt take it for granted that 795 shoes were 
795 it would just embarrass me and id want to go somewhere 
else but the old man was working his mojo on the shoe clerk 
wideman pays full attention to voices letting his characters 
dictate their own oral histories in docs story a mans 
girlfriend walks out on him and he copes by spending hours at the 
local basketball court shooting hoops and swapping stories 
hes obsessed by the story of doc a former teacher and local 
legend on the court it seems that doc went blind over the years 
but his touch for making foulshots remained undiminished to the 
narrator theres magic in docs story and perhaps in his own as 
well 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
if he had known docs story he would have said theres still 
a chance theres always a chance i mean this guy doc christ he 
was stone blind but he got out on the court and played over 
there right over there on that very court across the hollow from 
us it happened ive talked to people about it many times if doc 
could do that than anythings possible were possible 
if a blind man could play basketball surely we if he 
had known docs story would it have saved them he hears himself 
saying the words the ball arches from docs fingertips the 
miracle of it sinking would she have believed any of it 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
wideman himself has less faith once describing himself as a 
pessimist who doubts that things have gotten better bad news 
helped make him that way in 1975 his brother robert was 
involved in a robbery during which a man was murdered robert now 
serves a life sentence in jail an ordeal described in detail in 
brothers and keepers 
three years ago widemans son jake stabbed a friend to death 
and the victims parents have sued the author for damages wideman 
declines to discuss the case but when he talks of docs story 
and the acceptance of loss there is the realization that hes 
haunted by voices hed prefer not to hear 
you know the persons gone but theres some level which you 
hold on he said its hope it would take a miracle to get her 
back and he knows it the question all the stories raise is are 
miracles possible well probably not and its probably silly to 
hope they are but who knows 
part of the miracle to me is human hope and faith in face of 
the reality that things usually dont work out ninetynine times 
out of a hundred they dont work out they never work out in the 
sense that you get old and you die

union carbide corp said today that a 470 
million settlement for victims of the 1984 gasleak disaster in 
bhopal india remains binding even though the countrys new 
government has disavowed the settlement 
we are confident the settlement will stand there is simply no 
basis for overturning it joseph e geoghan union carbide vice 
president and general counsel said in a statement 
last week the new government of prime minister vp singh said 
its predecessor was wrong to agree to absolve union carbide of 
criminal liability in the gas disaster it also called the 
settlement inadequate 
justice minister dinesh goswami said the new government would 
support the gas victims and activists in supreme court petitions 
challenging the right of former prime minister rajiv gandhis 
government to settle the case 
but geoghan called the settlement extremely fair and said it 
is a binding agreement 
the new administration may not disavow the settlement because 
it disagrees with it he said 
at least 3598 people were killed and another 20000 injured 
when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a union carbide pesticide 
plant plant on dec 3 1984

campeau corps decision to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection from creditors for its two us retailing subsidiaries 
today means the debtswamped businesses can operate and many 
consumers may never notice a change 
none of the 260 stores operated by federated department stores 
inc and allied stores corp is expected to close although some may 
be sold as part of any future restructuring which will have to be 
approved by a bankruptcy judge under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy act companies are shielded from creditors while they 
remain in business and attempt to reorganize their finances so all 
debts eventually can be repaid many companies emerge from chapter 
11 as smaller but financially sound businesses 
in campeaus case the chapter 11 filings immediate result 
would be to keep stores open and supplied many businesses had been 
reluctant to continue shipping merchandise to campeau stores 
because they werent sure theyd be paid but the filing will 
establish a timetable for payment that should help reassure these 
suppliers 
it is unclear how the filing may affect campeaus 110000 
employees in the united states some of whom presumably could be 
laid off in any bankruptcy restructuring 
uncertainty over whether campeau would be able to repay the 8 
billion in debts it has acquired through takeovers of federated and 
allied in the 1980s was the main reason the parent company sought 
bankruptcy court refuge for its us units

the morning star britains communist daily 
newspaper published a frontpage appeal to its readers monday for 
240000 to buy new equipment 
the appeal was the only solution to the enormous crisis faced 
by the paper as the result of the drastic halving of the copies 
previously ordered by the soviet union the newspaper said 
the morning stars soviet distributor cut in half its daily 
order of 12000 copies on dec 25 after the kremlin ordered it to 
meet efficiency guidelines 
the tabloid which marked its 60th anniversary this month will 
lose an estimated 660000 of its annual income of 28 million 
because of the soviet cut 
up to 25 jobs will be cut and the newspaper will be reduced to 
eight pages from 12 until it can buy better printing equipment it 
said 
a clarion call is going out to all the democratic and 
progressive forces which the paper has served so long and so 
faithfully urging them to come to its aid the paper said 
it said the appeal has raised 3200 half from an employee who 
had planned to bequeath the money in her will and the other half 
from a lifelong reader 
the newspapers circulation now at 23500 peaked in 1947 at

these are times that challenge the determination 
and creativity of american car companies not just over the 
shortterm which is known to be a tough testing ground but in the 
long run too 
general motors profit on each car made in north america over 
the past decade has averaged 50 which is nothing to write about 
in the annual report but still it has lost market share how do 
you work out of that dilemma 
ford and chrysler and gm as well developed big interests in 
the defense industry during the 1980s not knowing that the 
economic and geopolitical map of the world would be scattered like 
a jigsaw puzzle undermining spending 
now all the car companies foreign and domestic are facing a 
congress that seems determined to raise the gasoline mileage 
performance of their products the better it is claimed to 
consersve fuel and keep the air clean 
the market meanwhile has become anemic instead of announcing 
recordhigh sales as they had become accustomed to the car 
companies now are announcing sales declines and production cutbacks 
in the 1989 final quarter domesticmake sales dropped to a 62 
million annual rate the lowest quarterly figure in nearly seven 
years and january production estimates are only 45 million units 
2 million below earlier plans 
over the longer term the picture might improve but probably 
not by a great degree according to a 10year outlook from the 
university of michigans transportation research institute 
the market through 2000 is likely to be a mature one it says 
with more offerings competing for a relatively fixed set of 
customers how did the institute reach that conclusion by 
interviewing 250 industry executives 
as a result of those interviews it concludes that manufacturers 
will be forced to reduce costs improve quality and offer better 
services to buyers an assignment that might chill the most 
confident executive 
it will mean says the study that manufacturers might have to 
extend power train warranties up to 10 years or 100000 miles on 
some models and that the average total life of cars will climb to 
12 years by 2000 from 11 in 1990 
at the same time prices will be held down they might climb in 
the next year or so the institute believes but then level off so 
that a usmade car costing 14000 in 1990 would sell for 15900 
in 2000 
of course all car companies will be expected simultaneously to 
continue with the same old assignment of improving sales month by 
month and year by year even if the market as a whole doesnt 
accommodate those goals 
the study estimated that passenger car sales in the united 
states will grow less than 1 percent a year over the decade to 
109 million units in 2000 from 101 million in 1990 light truck 
sales also will grow slowly but less so 
unless the big three surprise the institute and apparently 
themselves too their best efforts still will mean a loss of 
market share over the decade to 61 percent of passenger car sales 
in 2000 from 64 percent in 1990 
the estimates have unusual validity in the car market because 
the data on which they are made come so to speak from the horses 
mouth ie from automotive executives engineers suppliers 
consultants and academics 
the particular study that developed these figures is the fifth 
in a series of 10year forecasts directed by david e cole 
professor of mechanical engineering and director of the institutes 
study of automotive transportation 
the message it flashes couldnt be more clear carmakers who 
thought they had done everything possible to produce high quality 
cars at the lowest price will have to exert even greater effort 
the buyer is in the drivers seat

prices moved broadly lower on wall street today 
as traders shied away from the stock market after its sharp losses 
on friday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 1216 to 
267705 as of 2 pm est 
declining issues were ahead of advancers by a margin of about 5 
to 2 with 405 stocks rising 1064 falling and 437 unchanged on 
the new york stock exchange 
volume on the big board came to a moderate 10404 million shares 
at midafternoon 
the selling that began friday after two 
disappointing economic reports continued into todays session

buy analysts said side said michael metz an analyst with oppenheimer 
amp co 
the government reported friday that wholesale prices surged 07 
percent during december while retail sales rose a sluggish 02 
percent the combination of accelerating inflation and a softening 
economy unnerved many investors and stock prices fell sharply with 
the dow jones industrial average tumbling more than 71 points 
trading was relatively light today as many institutional buyers 
took the martin luther king jr holiday off 
financial markets in japan were closed for a holiday and many 
us traders were waiting to see how stocks would fare when tokyo 
trading resumed tuesday the japanese stock market had its worst 
decline in two years on likely to be 
similar to last week ishikawa said the yen will remain weak 
and the plunge in government bond prices will not stop any time 
soon 
former foreign minister shintaro abe and seven other lawmakers 
from the governing liberal democratic party are in moscow abe met 
monday with gorbachev 
another worry is inflation the weaker yen which makes imports 
of raw materials and fuel more expensive has increased 
inflationary pressures prompting the bank of japan to boost 
interest rates to curb price rises and support the yen 
it is too optimistic to see the current plunge as a 
transitional adjustment process said josen takahashi chief 
economist with mitsubishi research institute 
theres nothing positive in the securities market because of 
the current inflationary pressures he told the newspaper asahi 
shimbun 
takahashi said inflationary pressure in japan has created a 
triple low phenomenon a simultaneous decline in securities 
yen and government bond prices 
despite market expectations that the bank of japan will continue 
supporting the yen possibly by boosting the official discount 
rate traders said they expect the japanese currency to stay weak 
because of political uncertainty over national elections expected 
in february 
their major concern is whether the probusiness liberal 
democrats will maintain their majority in parliaments lower house 
the party lost its control in the lesspowerful upper house last 
year after a series of money and sex scandals involving party 
lawmakers and the introduction of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax 
the central bank also is expected to maintain its high interest 
rate policy in order to control inflationary pressures resulting 
from the weaker yen traders said

santa clara calif a us venture that was designed to regain 
control of the vital computer chip industry from japanese dominance 
is being folded because it failed to attract investors officials 
announced today 
us memories inc was hailed as a 1 billion cooperative 
venture by american companies but in its seven brief months of 
life it failed to make a single computer chip or earn a single 
dollar 
i am extremely disappointed by these turn of events said 
sanford l kane president of us memories at a news conference 
at santa clara headquarters what happens today does not bode 
well for an industry that has made a technical decision rather than 
a tactical one 
kane told reporters that the joint venture will be terminated 
largely because of a lack of support from the electronics industry 
the venture had not found a new investor since its formation 
last june by seven bigname backers international business 
machines corp digital equipment corp hewlettpackard co intel 
corp advanced micro devices inc national semiconductor corp 
and lsi logic according to a saturday report by the san francisco 
chronicle 
the new york times and the washington post had quoted 
unidentified industry sources indicating the venture would announce 
its demise today 
the consortium was planned to challenge japanese leadership in 
the making of computer memory chips called drams or dynamic random 
access memories often compared to crude oil in their importance to 
industry 
despite todays announcement kane said the venture had produced 
some positive results 
we did achieve some significant things in the process kane 
said we showed that with some creativity and support and 
teamwork we could come up with a solution within the american 
framework we clearly increased the impact of the seimconductor 
industry and drams in particular 
spokesmen for intel and advanced micro devices had told the san 
francisco chronicle they still supported the plan 
observers cited by the chronicle said the consortium may simply 
stop actively seeking investors or announce a restructuring plan 
but they said these developments are unlikely 
it looks like the end said tj rodgers chief executive of 
san josebased cypress semiconductor a critic of the consortium 
plan 
the failure would be regarded as a major setback for advocates 
of collective action to improve us competitiveness 
its a true strategic setback said ralph thomson chief 
executive of international business catalysts a palo alto 
consulting firm that focuses on trade and technology 
us memories in june announced its plan for construction of a 
1 billion plant to make the 4megabit dram chips the plant was to 
be paid for by 500 million in equity financing from chip makers 
and users and 500 million in debt with fund raising expected to 
be completed last year 
by november several major computer companies including sun 
microsystems inc unisys corp apple computer inc and tandy 
corp said they would not join as investors 
computer industry officials told the times that the end of us 
memories was decided wednesday at a meeting in dallas attended by 
the seven founding companies and others considering joining the 
venture 
the times said the project failed in part because the memory 
chips have become more widely available as samsung of south korea 
siemens ag of west germany and motorola inc of the united states 
have begun manufacturing the chips there had been a shortage of 
the chips in 1988 
by the mid1980s all but two of the us companies that 
pioneered the dram industry had left the field in the face of 
competition from the japanese who now supply the majority of 
memory chips

for the first time since prohibition a 
division of adolph coors co is selling a nonalcoholic beverage a 
new product called coors rocky mountain sparkling water company 
officials said monday 
the product goes on sale this week in colorado arizona and 
northern california cities mainly in the san francisco area coors 
spokesman heidi buehler nogues said 
bottled water is the fastestgrowing beverage category in 
america john recca brand development manager said in a news 
release the timing is right for us to take advantage of our 
legendary water source 
the product is made by coors brewing co which is a business 
unit of the goldenbased adolph coors co 
coors rocky mountain sparkling water will be packaged in 
65ounce sixpack bottles and in 28ounce bottes officials said 
it will be available in original lemon lime and cherry flavors 
in the past five years the bottled water marketplace has grown 
about 10 percent primarily because of the consumer interest in 
health and fitness coors said 
a key to coors product is the use of pure rocky mountain 
spring water an ingredient that has made the companys beers 
famous for 50 years coors said 
the new product also provides the company with a good 
opportunity to diversify its beverage line and provide consumers 
with new choices coors officials said this is especially 
important with the growing national trend toward moderate alcohol 
consumption 
during the 1920s the manufacture sale and transportation of 
alcoholic beverages was banned in the united states buehler nogues 
said coors sold malt beverages which did not contain alcohol the 
law was repealed in 1933

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki on 
monday urged prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan to increase 
investments and economic involvement to help polands reform 
efforts 
mazowiecki also thanked kaifu for his governments decision to 
contribute 150 million in credit to a stabilization fund to back 
the zloty as the part of the transition to a convertible polish 
currency but said more could be done 
i positively assess the state of political relations between 
our countries however economic cooperation does not catch up with 
them we want japan to occupy a considerably higher position both 
on the list of trading partners and as regards economic involvement 
in poland mazowiecki said at a lunch for kaifu 
we want this to this to be coupled with the transfer of 
patterns of japanese organization of production and high quality of 
labor recognized worldwide to the polish economy the pap news 
agency quoted mazowiecki as saying 
kaifu is the first major leader from asia to visit poland since 
mazowiecki was elected to lead polands first noncommunist 
government in over four decades on aug 24 
the united states and west germany have led the developed 
countries in pledging aid to help the troubled polish economy and 
assist radical economic reform efforts 
in addition to its pledge to the currency stabilization fund 
japan has agreed to provide poland with 25 million worth of food 
aid and 15 million to help train polish managers 
japan is considering a possible 350 million guarantee for 
government investments as well as a 500 million guarantee by the 
japanese exim bank for japanese investments in poland 
the conditions of the guarantees have yet to be worked out 
poland is also hoping for japanese support during negotiations 
by the paris club on polands 40 billion foreign debt 
poland would like a threeyear relief on interest payments on 
the debt so that precious hard currency can be used for investment 
purposes and to stabilize the currency 
kaifu assured president wojciech jaruzelski of further economic 
support for poland as economic experts discussed terms of future 
japanese credit guarantees during an earlier meeting 
kaifu also met with sejm speaker mikolaj kozakiewciz and senate 
speaker andrzej stelmachowski on the final day of a twoday visit 
to poland the pap news agency reported 
pap said that kaifu told jaruzelski that japan would increase 
its support for the changes underway in poland particularly in the 
field of financial cooperation 
after his meetings in poland kaifu traveled to budapest on the 
last leg of a sevencountry 10day tour of europe 
kaifu was met at the airport by his hungarian counterpart miklos 
nemeth the state hungarian news agency mti said

ralphs grocery co has avoided the 
financial woes gnawing at campeau corps other us companies 
federated department stores inc and allied stores corp ralphs 
chief said monday 
its business as usual chairman and chief executive byron 
allumbaugh said after allied and federated sought protection from 
their creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law 
nothing has occurred that will in any way change or alter the 
way ralphs does business allumbaugh said 
ralphs with 142 stores is the third largest supermarket chain 
in southern california 
torontobased campeau the huge retailer burdened with billions 
of dollars of debts acquired ralphs as part of its 1988 takeover 
of federated 
but ralphs became an independent corporation under the campeau 
umbrella in july 1988 and is unaffected by the bankruptcy filings 
we are a separate corporation from federated with our own 
debt our own bank financing allumbaugh said ralphs needs no 
funds from campeau and the campeau corp is prohibited from 
removing any funds from ralphs 
most ralphs customers are unaware the company is part of 
campeau and ralphs has no immediate plan to advertise to reassure 
them he said 
as part of the spinoff from federated ralphs management bought 
a stake in ralphs by paying federated 102 billion which the 
managers borrowed the cost of paying down that debt has kept 
ralphs in the red a circumstance expected as part of the deal 
but analysts say the grocery chain has had no problems paying 
interest on the nearly 1 billion debt that remains while 
remodeling and adding stores as needed 
for example ralphs had 40 million on hand to pay the 113 
million in debt due at the end of this month said andrew leinoff 
an analyst at mccarthy crisanti amp maffei in montpelier vt 
when rumors of the impending allied and federated filings began 
circulating last week allumbaugh and ralphs bankers and financial 
strategists met with suppliers to reassure them of the grocery 
chains solvency 
allumbaugh told the suppliers that ralphs has been able to cut 
its net losses from 726 million in fiscal 1988 to about 31 
million in fiscal 1989 which ends jan 28 
the company projects a net loss of 7 million in the coming 
year followed by a 17 million profit in fiscal 1991 he said 
for the year ending this month we had an operating cash flow 
of 189 million and the cash interest on our debt is about 130 
million so we have about 59 million of free cash flow to reinvest 
in our business allumbaugh said 
for ralphs customers the allied and federated bankruptcy 
filings are a nonevent allumbaugh said

percent in the final quarter of 1989 compared with the previous 
year while another large banking company first chicago corp 
reported an 11 percent drop in quarterly net income

three months ended dec 31 that compared with earnings of 275 
million or 293 a share in the 1988 period

chase used less income tax benefits than the previous year 25 
million vs 60 million

for the year the new yorkbased bank lost 665 million or 
794 a share after earning 106 billion or 1155 a share in 
1988 
chases annual loss reflects a decision made in the third 
quarter of last year to take an aftertax charge of 126 billion 
to carry out a recapitalization plan that included a 115 billion 
addition to its loanloss reserves for third world debt 
its total provision for possible credit losses was 174 billion 
for all of 1989 up sharply from 750 million for 1988 
in the fourth quarter chases loanloss provision totaled 130 
million down from 300 million in 1988

a year ago 115 million vs 1104 million in 1988 
the chicago banks income for 1989 totaled 3587 million or 
510 a share compared with earnings of 5131 million or 820 a 
share in 1988 fullyear operating income however was up 8 
percent to 4512 million or 656 per share from 4173 million 
or 657 a share

billion at the end of the year compared with 14 billion at the 
end of the third quarter and 131 billion at the end of 1988 
its provision for credit losses rose to 75 million in the 
fourth quarter from 50 million total net chargeoffs were 199

its a technical problem she said its not a cable cut

junk bond prices fell monday after a bankruptcy 
court filing by two campeau corp units whose financial troubles 
triggered the highyield bond markets severe tailspin last fall 
whenever that happens it is a disturbing event and its a drag 
on the market and it was said robert lupo director of 
highyield bond research at smith barney harris upham amp co 
traders said issues of highyield bonds on average fell about 
point to point the movement of a point is equivalent to a change 
of 10 for every 1000 in face value of the bond the widely 
watched 1371 percent rjr holdings capital corp bond due in 2009 
was down about point at 90 
the decision by campeaus federated department stores inc and 
allied stores corp to seek protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy law drew a subdued reaction because it had 
been expected traders said 
the two units of torontobased campeau operate 260 stores in the 
united states including bloomingdales jordan marsh abraham amp 
straus lazarus and sterns 
i dont think theres any major market participant whos 
surprised said david fineman a trader in drexel burnham lambert 
incs beverly hills calif highyield division the shock to 
the market in federated came months ago 
some analysts attributed the dull reaction to the bankruptcy 
filings made in cincinnati where federated and allied are based 
to light activity on the martin luther king jr holiday 
there might be some additional pressure to come from all this 
once everybodys back to their desks lupo said 
the government securities market was closed monday prices of 
corporate and municipal bonds were slightly lower in quiet trading 
said eric friedlander a corporate bond trader with 
prudentialbache securities corp 
junk bonds also fell sharply on friday in tandem with a sharp 
drop in the stock market mondays decline was the junk markets 
fourth straight 
the 210 billion highyield bond market has slumped since 
campeaus surprise disclosure of liquidity problems last september 
prices have not recovered entirely and new issues of junk bonds 
have been squelched because of the selloff 
for the 1989 fourth quarter analysts said highyield bonds 
showed a total return of negative 4 percent 
federated and allied bonds were mostly lower monday allied 105 
percent junk bonds declined more than two points to 42 while 115 
percent bonds were unchanged at 11 federated bonds yielding 16 
percent were down about two points to 12 
bonds of ralphs grocery co a campeauowned southern california 
chain took the days biggest hit down about three points at 95 
ralphs was not included in the bankruptcy filing but traders said 
there is concern bondholders may seek to claim they were defrauded 
because of campeaus troubles 
among other notable issues rjr 1371 percent bonds due in 2007 
were down about point at 79lsqb rh macy amp co bonds due in 2001 
were down nearly a point at 84 
moodys investors service inc said it lowered the ratings on 
all allied and federated subordinated debt because of the filing

allied debt securities were affected it said the companies were in 
default on a 234 billion bank loan 
due to the bankruptcy filing the allied and federated bonds 
were trading flat that is without accrued interest junk

petroleum futures nosedived monday amid 
profittaking and investor worries about mounting heating oil 
supplies 
analysts said warmer weather and growing imports were 
contributing to a buildup in heating oil inventories just weeks 
after investor worries about possible heating oil shortages sent 
prices soaring to decade highs 
it became clear the middle of last week that the fears were 
unfounded as cargos of heating oil were arriving at new york 
ports said tom bentz director of futures trading for united 
energy inc 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
no 2 heating oil tumbled 505 cents to settle at 6460 cents a 
gallon erasing nearly half of last weeks gains of 1117 cents a 
gallon contracts for delivery after february lost between 170 
cents and 2 cents 
crude oil and gasoline futures also fell sharply pressured by 
weakness in the heating oil market analysts said 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil fell 77 cents to 2236 a barrel partly 
on profittaking after recent gains march crude lost 64 cents to 
2149 and april declined 56 cents to 2095 a barrel 
february unleaded gasoline sank 150 cents to 6359 cents a 
gallon while march fell 121 cents to 6304 cents and april ended 
at 6292 cents a gallon down 114 cents 
analysts said talk of a possible strike at petrobras brazils 
staterun oil company kept gasoline futures from falling further 
brazil currently ships three to six cargos of gasoline to the 
united states a month said bentz one cargo contains 225000 
barrels 
a strike would affect us if its longterm bentz said 
analysts said worries about possible heating oil shortages in 
recent weeks brought a slew of imports from europe and other 
countries 
the concern was prompted by unusually frigid weather in many 
parts of the united states as well as refinery problems including 
a fire and explosion at a huge exxon refinery in december that 
closed the facility for several days 
it looks as if more supply is coming from europe than before 
and that has kicked the bottom from heating oil and also weakened 
gasoline said james steel an analyst at refco inc

us automakers wrestling with a depressed 
market head into 1990 with an inventory swollen nearly 40 percent 
over last years level and hopes that temporary factory shutdowns 
and incentives will shrink it 
the eight major automakers who make cars in the us report 
earlyjanuary sales tuesday the first reporting period of a year 
most industry officials and analysts have said will be weaker than 
1989 when about 148 million new vehicles hit american roads 
the weekly wards automotive reports in detroit said monday 
dealers had a 91day supply of new north americanbuilt cars on 
hand as of dec 31 fast track news in wayne pa showed a 92day 
supply at the same time 
wards said that at the same time in 1988 dealers had a 66day 
supply one day less than what fast track news estimated the 1988 
figure was effected by a latedecember incentiveinspired buying 
spree 
the automakers are gambling that production cuts and incentives 
will shrivel inventories this month the companies were shut down 
monday because of the observance of martin luther king jrs 
birthday 
on dec 15 chrysler corp announced an enhanced incentive 
package which was matched to some degree by ford motor co 
and by the end of this month more than 120000 auto workers 
each will have spent at least a week away from their jobs on 
temporary layoff as the companies tried to bring production into 
line with stock 
production in january coupled by fairly aggressive 
incentives suggest that inventories will come down by the end of 
the first quarter analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co 
of new york said monday 
at this time of year a supply of 70 to 75 days is considered 
normal automakers usually arent bothered by supplies creeping up 
a little in january and february in anticipation of a rush of sales 
in march and april 
but things are different this year 
the auto industry went into a slump at nearly the same moment as 
the 1990 model year officially started oct 1 fear of 1990 model 
price increases and scaledback incentive programs drove 
prospective buyers into showrooms in august and september 
because of that automakers expected depressed sales in october 
and november and they got what they expected but what they may 
not have expected was that the slump would continue 
to deal with the combined effects of lower consumer demand and 
increasing inventories automakers shut down plants and the 
production reduction spread beyond the big three of ford chrysler 
and general motors corp 
in the past us plants operated wholly or partly by japanese 
companies called transplants have been immune from cutbacks 
because demand for their vehicles has held up while orders for cars 
made by the big three sagged 
thats changed for some of the products coming from three plants 
making cars shipped to us dealers under japanese and us car 
company nameplates 
mazda motor corps flat rock mich plant the gmtoyota motor 
corp plant in fremont calif and the chryslermitsubishi motors 
corp joint venture in normal ill each have announced production 
reductions 
the reductions have come in cars carrying us company 
nameplates the ford probe from flat rock the geo prizm sold by 
chevrolet dealers from the new united motor manufacturing inc 
plant in california and the plymouth laser from the diamondstar 
motors corp plant in illinois

heating oil futures prices tumbled monday on the new york 
mercantile exchange as unseasonably warm weather spread across the 
country easing demand for home heating fuel 
on other commodity markets orange juice futures ended mixed 
after soaring early in the session futures prices for precious 
metals grains and soybeans and livestock and meat also finished 
mixed 
most wholesale heating oil futures fell 185 cents to 2 cents 
the permitted daily limit the contract for delivery in february 
on which the limit has been lifted pending its jan 31 expiration

cents to 77 cents with february at 2236 a barrel unleaded 
gasoline futures settled 114 cents to 15 cents lower with 
february at 6359 cents a gallon 
the plunge in heating oil prices marked the first downturn in 
the february contract in a week the selloff was largely a 
reaction to springlike weather in much of the northern united 
states especially the populous northeast where recordbreaking 
cold in december had spurred strong demand for heating oil and 
pushed prices up sharply 
decembers temperatures were 20 percent below normal and now 
it looks like january may end up 20 percent above normal said 
jim ritterbusch vice president of trading and research with carson

general electric co plans to close its 
factory in somersworth idling nearly 1700 workers for a week jan 
2226 because of slowing orders the company said monday 
zelda kenney ge spokeswoman said the production workers will 
be given the choice of taking the week as vacation or claiming 
unemployment benefits for the week she said the temporary shutdown 
is designed to avoid laying off workers the factory makes meters 
that are installed in houses to measure how much electricity is 
used the slowdown in orders comes from a drop in the number of 
houses and other structures being built she said adding that ge 
sells meters to utilities and utilities rely heavily on a steady 
flow of construction 
kenney said utilities are placing orders with ge at a slower 
rate than usual and the week off is meant to build up a backlog of 
orders so that employees can return to work at their usual rate 
the regions economic slowdown she added is another indirect 
cause for the drop in orders

the drugmaker said it was negotiating a deal to sell a 68 percent 
stake to another company 
a merger would be the latest consolidation in the worldwide

shares 
rorer said the deal was designed to make it a larger stronger 
worldwide pharmaceutical company it said the company would 
remain publicly traded and that current shareholders would retain a 
position of about 32 percent

last july in which dow chemical co last july agreed to acquire 67 
percent of marion laboratories inc stock over the next two to 
three years 
rorer spokesman john donahue declined to elaborate on the 
statement

us memories a joint venture 
created to expand americas small share of the computer chip 
market is dissolving because of inadequate financial support from 
the industry it was announced monday 
what we saw was an unwillingness to support sufficient equity 
as well as purchase commitments to go forward said company 
president sanford l kane 
at the same time he criticized the industry for concentrarting 
on shortterm tactics rather than longterm strategy 
us memories hailed by american companies when it was formed 
last june to invest 1 billion in a chipmaking plant decided to 
terminate the venture after a meeting wednesday in dallas with the 
original seven investing companies and four other potential backers 
two original backers international business machines corp and 
digital equipment corp maintained their major commitment to the 
venture but kane said the others were not willing to put up enough 
money to fund the ventures first plant or agree to buy enough of 
its 4megabit dynamic random access memory chips or drams 
from early on we all knew the viability of us memories was 
contingent on that kane said at a news conference 
american computer companies depend heavily on foregin 
manufacturers primarily those in japan for drams a common form 
of chip important in computers household appliances and the us 
defense system they often are compared to crude oil in their 
importance to industry 
us memories which estimated that american companies currently 
supply no more than 10 percent of the american demand for the 
chips hoped to produce 25 percent of the drams needed by us 
computer companies 
inadequate supply and high cost of drams prompted the formation 
of us memories last year in addition to ibm and digital 
original investors included hewlettpackard co intel corp 
advanced micro devices inc national semiconductor corp and lsi 
logic 
but since then supply has increased and the price has dropped 
largely because several new companies including samsung of south 
korea have begun making the chips according to analysts us 
companies needing drams apparently no longer think they have a 
problem kane said 
j richard iverson president of the american electronics 
association which supports efforts to increase the us share of 
the chip market said i dont know what we could have done 
more 
theres no way of coercing companies into doing what we think 
is right or what they think is right these are individual 
business decisions he said 
kane also would not criticize electronics companies for their 
individual decisions not to give us memories as much financial 
support as the consortium hoped but he was extremely 
disappointed and worried about the future of americas 
electronics industry 
what happens today does not bode well it is a sign of 
where we are going said kane who said the developments showed 
an inability of american electronics companies to cooperate 
were kind of like an allstar sports team we have a number 
of superstars who are individually great in their way but cant 
work together he said 
us memories originally planned to pay for the computer chip 
plant with 500 million in equity financing from chip makers and 
users and 500 million in debt with fund raising expected to be 
completed last year 
the consortium later decided it would need 400 million in debt 
and 350 million in equity 150 million from industry investors 
and the rest from outside backers computer companies however 
also would have had to agree to buy 75 to 80 percent of the 
consortiums drams 
but the plant was never built and no chips were produced 
despite mondays announcement kane said the venture had 
produced some positive results 
we did achieve some significant things in the process kane 
said we showed that with some creativity and support and 
teamwork we could come up with a solution within the american 
framework we clearly increased the impact of the seimconductor 
industry and drams in particular

that a majority of its members had voted to continue payments 
through the end of february to eastern airlines pilots who had been 
on strike and still havent found jobs 
the vote called for maintaining strike benefits but at a 
reduced level through the end of next month

was needed to maintain the payments 
im grateful to them skip copeland head of the alpa 
chapter at eastern said in a telephone interview from miami it 
sustains the eastern pilots a little while longer while we get our 
life back in order 
most of the 2400 or so striking eastern pilots voted nov 22 to 
abandon their ninemonth sympathy walkout after president bush 
vetoed legislation to set up a blueribbon commission to look into 
the strike none of the pilots or the flight attendants who ended 
their strike soon afterward were subsequently taken back by 
eastern which had hired nonunion replacement workers and 
accepted some striking workers who crossed picket lines earlier 
the machinists union remains on strike against the miamibased 
carrier 
the 40000 or so alpa members nationwide had been paying about 3 
percent of their salary to their eastern colleagues the benefits 
to eastern pilots have averaged about 2400 a month per flier 
since the walkout began last march 4 
following the new alpa vote the benefits will be cut to an 
average 1600 a month on jan 14 and to 1400 a month on feb 1

earnings declined 1 percent partly because of higher research and 
development costs and its stock buyback program 
ncr said it earned 147 million in the quarter ended dec 31 
down from 149 million in the same period a year earlier 
the company reported pershare earnings of 202 up from 185

1989 which raised its pershare performance but helped lower its 
overall earnings 
fourthquarter revenue totaled 179 billion down slightly from 
last years 18 billion ncr said 
ncr attributed the earnings decline to higher investment in 
research and development lower revenue and gross profit margins 
and the stock repurchase program

operating expenses

the 439 million it posted in 1988 pershare earnings were 538 
up from 533 the previous year

the new head of campbell soup co said 
monday that he believed the troubled foods giant could show 
different operating results within a year but he wanted to focus 
more on longterm gains 
david w johnson campbells new president and chief executive 
also told a news conference that the best way to keep the 
120yearold company independent was for its controlling dorrance 
family recently beset by bickering over whether to sell campbell 
to hold on to its shares 
campbells board of directors appointed johnson on jan 3 
saying the 57yearold australian was brought from gerber products 
co because of his experience in turning around beleaguered 
companies 
in addition to recently lackluster financial results campbell 
faces dissension among its biggest shareholders over whether to 
sell the company 
a group led by three grandchildren of company founder john t 
dorrance sr which owns 174 percent of campbells stock has 
announced it wants to sell its stake and encouraged the board of 
directors to put the entire company on the block 
three other dorrance grandchildren who own 313 percent of the 
stock say they want to keep their shares and maintain the companys 
independence 
i dont think theres anything wrong with a family to have 
disagreements johnson said 
he said the best way for the company to maintain its 
independence was for the dorrance heirs to keep their shares 
johnson arrived at gerber in 1987 after the baby food companys 
market share had dropped to 52 percent from 67 percent the decline 
was attributed to a safety scare after glass shards were found in 
some of the companys products although the food and drug 
administration later absolved gerber of any responsibility for the 
problem 
at gerber johnson sold off businesses unrelated to the baby 
food operations and made other changes credited for a financial 
performance that enabled the company to raise its dividends from 66 
cents per share in 1987 to the present 96 cents per share 
johnson replaces r gordon mcgovern who announced his early 
retirement in november after serving as president and chief 
executive since 1980 analysts have said that unhappy shareholders 
forced mcgoverns retirement 
johnson told an audience of about 200 campbell employees that in 
the the companys restructuring there will inevitably be 
divestitures and redundancies 
we will try to become leaner and meaner through natural 
attrition that is by not replacing people who leave or retire 
he said 
however johnson also told reporters that it was too early to 
advocate either divestitures or acquisitions for the company which 
had 57 billion in sales in fiscal 1989 
i came here with no predispositions johnson said i came 
in here really to do my homework 
johnson said the company falls at the bottom of the food 
products industry in its earnings per share growth which has been 
8 percent to 9 percent annually in recent years that number should 
be in the 12 percent to 15 percent range he said 
in its first fiscal quarter ended oct 29 campbell posted a 
profit of 83 million or 64 cents a share on sales of 152 
billion compared with a profit of 694 million or 54 cents per 
share on sales of 133 billion a year earlier

apple computer inc said monday it will 
cut its work force possibly in part through layoffs and will 
freeze some salaries for six months because of slumping revenues 
the personal computer maker also announced that it was 
eliminating company cars for usbased executives and cutting back 
its profitsharing plan 
though firstquarter figures will not be ready until thursday 
we know that revenues and profits will not meet our expectations 
for this quarter john sculley apples chairman president and 
chief executive officer said in a letter to the companys 12000 
employees 
in various parts of the world apples growth is slower than 
we anticipated in our fiscal year 1990 business plan given these 
results we are reexamining our outlook for fiscal year 1990 and 
are taking immediate actions to bring expense growth better in line 
with revenue growth 
sculley did not say how many jobs could be eliminated he said 
there would be normal head count attrition a significant 
drop in hiring activity consolidation of some areas and 
transfers of some employees 
it will also be necessary to eliminate positions he said 
were not ruling out layoffs said company spokeswoman carla 
levasseur she said the only recent layoffs involved 60 employees 
in canada on dec 13 in addition 100 employees in the us sales 
and marketing divisions were redeployed in september she said 
taking new assignments within apple or leaving the company 
ms levasseur blamed the companys slump on a general slowdown 
in the computer industry but apple also has been hurt by sagging 
sales of some of its leading product lines particularly several 
models of the macintosh and the apple ii personal computers during 
a time in which it stressed more powerful models for corporate use 
sculleys letter said all professionallevel employees would 
move from a sixmonth to a 12month salary review schedule 
effective immediately ms levasseur said this meant they would get 
no raises for at least six months vice presidents and executive 
staff members who got no regular raises last year will also get 
none this year 
the profitsharing plan which paid 494 million to employees 
last year will be scaled back on april to a plan that is more 
closely tied to apples financial performance goals sculley said 
ms levasseur said the phaseout of company automobiles by april 
1 would affect over 100 us executives
