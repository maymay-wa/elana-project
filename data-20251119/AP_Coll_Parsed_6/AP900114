a female army intelligence officer whose 
specialty is panama filed a complaint over her exclusion from the 
us invasion there but said sunday her problem stems from 
confused policy rather than sexism 
i think that it was not deliberate sgt rhonda maskus said 
on cbstvs face the nation in an interview from the armys 
fort bragg 
ma maskus filed the complaint jan 3 with the armys office of 
inspector general in washington army officials have declined to 
comment on the complaint 
ms maskus a spanish linguist and intelligence analyst who is 
an expert on panama described herself as a major factor in the 
contingency planning for panama 
but ms maskus who belongs to the 82nd airborne division did 
not go to that latin american country when us forces invaded dec 
20 instead a male soldier she said was not an expert on panama 
was sent to a secure us base ms maskus said 
now if i had been a male soldier without doubt without 
question without hesitation i would have been the one deployed to 
panama she said 
also appearing on face the nation were christopher jehn 
assistant secretary of defense for personnel brian mitchell 
author of the weak link a book against women in the military 
and rep patricia schroeder dcolo who supports women serving in 
combat positions 
it has been my contention all along that it is because of a 
confused policy that the army especially 82nd airborne division 
is just not quite sure where to put its females in when comes to 
actual operational roles especially considering the mission the 
82nd has as a quick deployment force ms maskus said 
jehn acknowledged the army policy that bans women in combat 
units but allows them in groups such as supply battalions and 
military police who can be fired upon may seem inconsistent 
it seems inconsistent to many i know he said it is very 
difficult to defend putting women at risk in one situation and not 
in others except on the basis of some of the arguments weve heard 
earlier that the presence of wommen in combat units would in some 
way or another adversely affect the effectiveness of those units 
ms maskus said she does not look forward to facing fire but 
hopes her complaint paves the way for other women who want to serve 
in the armed forces 
ill take it as far i have to take it which can be all the 
way up to the department of the army congress the president if 
need be just to be sure that females that come into the 82nd 
airborne division behind me do not face the same problem she 
said 
the invasion resulted in the surrender of ousted panamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega who was brought to the united 
states to face drug charges 
twentythree us servicemen died in the invasion 
about 600 of the 24500 us soldiers who participated in the 
invasion were women

us soldiers briefly detained the 
cuban ambassador sunday officials said it was the second time he 
was stopped and searched since the invasion to oust gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
also sunday manuel solis palma a former president under 
noriega was reportedly in the venezuelan embassy waiting for word 
on his petition for asylum 
at a roadblock outside the cuban embassy us troops stopped 
ambassador lazaro mora secada and two other embassy officials the 
cuban consul said 
the ambassador was going home in a vehicle with diplomatic 
plates said the consul jose luis mendez they took his 
passport and would not let him leave if he didnt let them check 
the group 
mendez said he was detained at 145 pm 
a us embassy official confirmed the report and added that the 
ambassador had been released by 4 pm its been resolved said 
the official who was reached by telephone he did not elaborate 
on dec 28 mora was stopped by us forces and had to go with 
them to obtain documents for another embassy employee traveling 
with him 
the cuban embassy has given refuge to noriegas family the 
panamanian government of guillermo endara which replaced noriega 
after the dec 20 invasion has refused to allow the noriega family 
to leave for exile in the dominican republic 
noriega sought refuge in the vatican embassy on christmas eve 
and surrendered to us forces 10 days later he awaits trial on 
drug charges in miami 
about 500 cubans in panama staged a rally sunday to publicize 
their efforts to seek asylum in the united states 
hector higueras vice president of the cuban refugees commission 
of panama said the refugees are asking the us and panamanian 
governments that they give their technical and material support 
for the united states to urgently accept their immigration 
higueras said the cuban refugees do not have permission to work 
and have no rights in panama he said that under a deal between 
cuba and the deposed noriega government the cubans paid 8000 to 
20000 to come to panama as a transit point to the united states 
solis palmas wife said saturday that she believed her husband 
had taken refuge in the venezuelan embassy solis palma was 
appointed president on feb 26 when arturo delvalle was removed for 
trying to fire noriega he held the post until sept 1 1989 
in caracas president carlos andres perez said that his 
government was studying solis palmas petition for asylum 
this is possible because we are devoted to the right of 
asylum and we cannot deny asylum to anyone without an evaluation 
perez told reporters 
troops continue to surround several foreign embassies including 
those of cuba and nicaragua where an undetermined number of 
noriegas officers and cronies are believed to have sought asylum 
noriegas wife felicidad and the couples three daughters have 
been inside the cuban embassy residence since the night of the 
invasion and us soldiers have blocked off most traffic in that 
neighborhood located in the plush san francisco district of the 
capital

on guam crews worked to clear damage and restore water and 
power service cut when the storm hit sunday night 
by noon monday 9 pm sunday est koryns center was 40 miles 
north of saipan and the storm was moving northnortheast at 8 mph 
said navy lt diane crittenden of the joint typhoon warning center 
on guam 
the typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and gusts 
reaching 110 mph was believed to have reached its peak she said 
if the storm kept to its course it would not hit any other

moved to community shelters said civil defense coordinator felix 
sasamopo the airport was closed 
on guam water service was restored to about 40 percent of the 
islands population of 130000 and 40 percent remained without 
electricity said ben reyes a staff officer with guam civil 
defense

san franciscans who have strongly 
supported us sen alan cranston said by more than a 21 margin 
that he should not seek reelection and they would not vote for 
him according to a newspaper poll 
city residents surveyed in the poll published in sundays 
editions of the san francisco examiner said by a 41 margin that 
cranstonsconduct on behalf of a troubled savings and loan was 
improper 
but four out of five said the states senior senator who has 
promised to run for a fifth term in 1992 should be allowed to 
serve out his term 
if you see these numbers in san francisco you can only assume 
the numbers are worse elsewhere said bruce cain a political 
scientist who is associate director of the institute of 
governmental studies at the university of california berkeley 
in the poll conducted from dec 26 to dec 30 by richard hertz 
consulting of bodega bay 401 city residents were interviewed by 
telephone 
cranston the democratic majority whip is one of five senators 
under fire for interceding with regulators on behalf of charles 
keating jr president of lincoln savings amp loan cranstons 
reelection committee and voter registration efforts received a 
total of more than 12 million in contributions from keating 
the institution went bankrupt and regulators estimate taxpayers 
will have to pay up to 2 billion to cover its loss of federally 
insured deposits through sham land transactions fraud and 
racketeering 
cranston called his backing of keating a political mistake 
but denied it was improper or illegal 
asked whether cranston acted properly 531 percent of 
respondents said no 10 percent said yes and 369 percent said 
they did not know 
to the question of whether the senator should run again 564 
percent said no 277 percent said yes and 16 percent said they did 
not know 
asked whether they would vote for cranston again 534 percent 
said no 234 percent said yes and 232 percent said they did not 
know 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent 
when cranston first took office in 1968 san franciscans gave 
him 80 percent of their vote he received 78 percent in 1974 80 
percent in 1980 and 74 percent in 1986 his closest election in 
which he won by less than 1 percent statewide

an electrical fire broke out in a 
discotheque early sunday giving off poisonous smoke that killed 43 
people and injured three others said officials in this northern 
city 
the victims were in the basement of the club where a local band 
was playing when the fire broke out and many of the dead were 
still sitting in their chairs when they were found said deputy 
mayor luis garcia nieto 
the blaze began shortly before 240 am near the front door of 
the flying discotheque filled with about 130 people government 
spokesman ignacio bruna said in this city about 160 miles northeast 
of the capital madrid 
the smoke funneled through air conditioning ducts down to the 
basement where the dance floor bar and lounge are located said 
the central government representative in zaragoza carlos perez 
anadon 
firefighters arrived eight minutes after the blaze broke out and 
quickly extinguished the flames but rescue workers could do little 
to save the victims said garcia nieto speaking to spanish 
national radio rne 
the speed with which people died may have been due to the 
presence of hydrocyanic acid in the smoke the national news 
service efe quoted civil protection head antonio herrera as saying 
hydrocyanic acid is used to produce acryclics 
bruna said a woman was being treated for smoke inhalation in the 
intensive care unit of miguel servet hospital which reported her 
condition as serious two others had been treated for minor 
injuries he added 
he said preliminary information indicated the fire was caused by 
an electrical overload 
it began on the ground floor near the door he said adding 
all 43 killed had been in the discotheques basement and died of 
smoke inhalation 
at the municipal morgue several dozen anxious people waited to 
find out whether family members were among the dead 
bruna said 25 victims had been identified as area residents 
their ages ranged from 21 to 52 but most were between 25 and 35 
years old 
garcia nieto said the discotheque had been licensed oct 3 
1984 a year after authorities passed a new series of tough fire 
regulations after a dec 17 1983 fire killed more than 90 people 
in the alcala 20 discotheque in madrid 
he said the discotheque had been routinely investigated since 
then to ensure it complied with the regulations 
it would appear the discotheque was in compliance with all 
the regulations bruna said 
the national news agency efe quoted a waitress who said the fire 
blocked one of the two stairways leading from the basement to the 
street 
i smelled something burning and in seconds nobody could get 
out said the waitress who added she escaped up the main 
stairway after seeing the emergency steps were blocked by flames 
while i was going up towards the main door a group of 
customers probably blinded by the smoke were trying to get up the 
emergency steps but im sure they couldnt get out because the 
fire was there said the waitress who was not identified

columbias astronauts were busy 
with medical and science experiments sunday as they soared past the 
halfway point of what a flight director called a flawless 
flight 
near the midpoint the crew was beaming to earth a television 
shot of mission specialist marsha ivins checking david low with an 
echocardiograph a device which generates a twodimensional 
crosssection image of the heart 
it is one of many experiments the astronauts are conducting to 
determine how well the human body adapts to weightlessness in space 
columbia launched tuesday is scheduled to land at 259 am 
pst friday at edwards air force base calif 
assessing the first half of the trip flight director al 
pennington said it has been a flawless flight we have a 
beautifully running orbiter 
we have achieved our main objectives of releasing the syncom 
satellite and retrieving the long duration exposure facility he 
said for the rest of the time we will do the secondary 
experiments and work on the edo objectives 
edo means extended duration orbiter the 10day flight is the 
second longest shuttle mission yet and is intended as a stepping 
stone toward even longer shuttle flights and monthslong trips 
aboard space station freedom 
the sixth day of the 10day mission began when fellow notre dame 
alumni serenaded columbia pilot jim wetherbee with a rousing wakeup 
song 
the strains of notre dame victory march sung by an ad hoc 
mission control choir were beamed to the shuttle at 1230 am 
that was provided by local alumni of a school you know pretty 
well said mission controls ken bowersox 
yeah theres a lot of damers down there said wetherbee a 
1974 graduate of the school in aerospace engineering 
commander dan brandenstein wetherbee and mission specialists 
bonnie dunbar ivins and low were continuing experiments begun the 
day of launch including imax movie camera observations of selected 
locations on earth 
this is the secondlongest shuttle mission that weve had so 
far so we can do some good materials science experiments up here 
and we can also get some very good medical data low said 
saturday 
one experiment involving melting and resolidifying a metal 
broke down friday when a crack developed in a glass container 
probably because of overheating but pennington said sunday that 
experts on the ground had worked out a solution to the problem and 
the astronauts were working to resume operation of the experiment 
the glass container called an ampul contains the element 
indium a metal that melts at a relatively low temperature it had 
been feared that the cracked glass could shatter sending shards of 
glass floating around the cabin 
pennington said one of the astronauts wearing a mask and 
gloves removed the cracked container and carefully vacuumed the 
machine there was no sign of any loose glass shards pennington 
said a new glass ampul will be installed later sunday he said 
the astronauts on friday captured the 11ton long duration 
exposure facility a space laboratory and tucked it into the 
shuttles cargo bay in time to save it and 57 experiments on board 
from burning up in an expected march 9 plunge into earths 
atmosphere 
the astronauts took time out for a little fun saturday 
afternoon playing the song attack of the killer tomatoes from 
a movie by the same name as they showed mission control a drawing 
of ldef wildly entwined in tomato vines 
it was a joking reference to an ldef experiment that consists of 
125 million tomato seeds for student experiments and research 
brandensteins 22yearold daughter adelle had sent a greeting to 
the crew asking have the killer tomatoes attacked yet 
i guess that answers adelles question earlier the 
commander said

the communist party of great britain on sunday 
elected its first woman general secretary nina temple who is the 
partys news media and publicity officer 
the partys executive committee voted 34 to 1 with three 
abstaining 
miss temple 33 succeeds gordon mclennan 62 who retired as 
leader of the 7500member party after 14 years 
she said the party has become completely marginalized in 
british society partly because of its association with those huge 
edifices in eastern europe which were so undemocratic and partly 
because of our own selfimposed limitations 
miss temple joined the communist party at age 13 and became 
general secretary of the young communist league her father landon 
temple runs progressive tours which promotes visits to the soviet 
union 
hardliners broke away from the communist party of great britain 
in 1984 following mclennans attempts at moderation and formed a 
splinter party

about 100 activists marched to the governors 
residence on sunday to plea for more democracy before britain hands 
this colony back to china in 1997 
they presented a petition addressed to british foreign minister 
douglas hurd who is in hong kong on a fourday visit 
the protesters want to double the number of directly elected 
legislators to 20 of the governing bodys 56 seats next year 
marching from a downtown park to governors house the official 
residence and office of gov sir david wilson the demonstrators 
chanted we want democracy we want human rights and full 
democracy to people of hong kong 
we are not asking for sympathy from britain we are asking for 
the rights we deserve said yeung sum a spokesman for the march 
we hope hurd would respect hong kong peoples wishes to set up a 
democratic political system in 1991 
the demonstration was organized by the joint committee on the 
promotion of democratic government which says it includes 150 
trade unions student groups and other organizations 
in the letter to hurd the committee said hong kong is a 
political orphan because china suppresses prodemocracy movements 
in hong kong and britain betrays hong kong peoples rights 
we who cannot emigrate have to face this problem and set 
up a real democratic political system the letter said 
under a 1984 agreement hong kong is to retain its freewheeling 
capitalist system and a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after 
1997 but since the june 4 crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
in china confidence in beijings promise has evaporated 
since june 4 the government has been pushing a plan to speed up 
the pace and extent of democratization in the colony the 
government currently is calling for 18 of the 56 legislatures 
seats to be contested in 1991 about 50 percent in 1997 and 100 
percent in 2003 
currently 24 of the 56 members in the legislative council are 
elected by bodies representing labor business and districts aside 
from the 10 popularly elected the rest are appointed by the 
government 
when he arrived in hong kong on saturday hurd said the ground 
rules would be ready for the direct elections in a few weeks 
last month the chineseappointed committee writing the basic 
law the blueprint to run the territory after 1997 decided that 
fewer than 18 seats would be directly elected in the legislature 
after 1997

signs advertising cigarette and alcohol are 
appearing in childrens video arcade games with video motorcycles 
racing past budweiser billboards and race cars speeding underneath 
marlboro banners 
one game super monaco gp manufactured by sega of america 
includes marlboro race cars billboards banners and marlboro signs 
in the crowd occasionally the cars race past a building in which 
all of the windows have been replaced by marlboro logos 
in segas arcade game power drift race cars pass budweiser 
billboards 
philip morris the maker of marlboro and anheuser busch which 
makes budweiser said friday that they had not authorized the use 
of their brand names or logos philip morris said it had asked sega 
to recall the games 
sega said in a statement that the inclusion of the logos was 
simply a game designers innocent attempt to mimic reallife 
locations it said it was in the process of removing them the 
statement did not indicate how many games were manufactured or how 
long they have been in use 
super monaco gp is essentially one big marlboro ad says dr 
john w richards of the medical college of georgia who has 
investigated the video game cigarette ads 
a child playing super monaco gp is exposed to literally 
hundreds of marlboro ads during the game if hes good richards 
wrote last month in a letter of complaint to the federal trade 
commission richards is president of doctors ought to care or doc 
an antismoking group 
if hes not good and doesnt reach extended play then hell 
see only 50 or so marlboro ads richards wrote a copy of the 
letter was obtained by the associated press 
i think its regrettable at best and scandalous at worst 
that this is happening said dr ronald m davis director of the 
office on smoking and health of the us centers for disease 
control 
its a strong indication that the cigarette industry is 
interested in luring children to begin to smoke certainly with all 
the resources available to the cigarette companies theyd prevent 
this obvious copyright infringement if they werent interested in 
kids he said 
smoking kills 390000 americans each year and 90 percent of 
smokers take up the habit as teenagers davis said 
steven weiss manager of media relations for philip morris usa 
in new york said the company only recently found out about the 
video game advertisements 
sega has not asked permission to use our logo and moreover 
we would not grant such permission to use any of our cigarette 
logos in any video game especially those played by minors weiss 
said in an interview friday 
all our cigarette advertising and promotions are directed at 
informed adult smokers only he said 
weiss said philip morris wrote to sega on nov 20 asking the 
company to stop using the marlboro logo and recall all games that 
include it 
the letter was sent seven days after rep thomas luken of ohio 
wrote philip morris to say his subcommittee wanted to hold hearings 
on the video game advertisements 
a video game in australia called pole position contained the 
marlboro logo in 1983 according to the march 5 1983 issue of the 
medical journal of australia the journal said that a philip morris 
official in australia had been informed then of the existence of 
the logos in the games 
scott murdock director of sales promotion and merchandising for 
anheuser busch inc which makes budweiser said in a statement 
that the company had not authorized the use of its brand name or 
logo based on the information you have provided to us we will 
ask our legal department to investigate the matter he said 
dave rosen cochairman of the board of sega of america said in 
a statement that there is absolutely no form of paid or 
intentional advertising displayed in any of segas arcade or 
consumer video games 
were already in the process of removing any graphics that 
could unintentionally be construed as reallife product in our 
games and packaging he said 
richards said he has seen the games at video arcades in south 
carolina tennessee and georgia the associated press found the 
same games at a video arcade in new york citys times square 
the federal trade commission which regulates advertising said 
it cannot disclose whether it is investigating the video game 
advertisements but the commissions new chairman janet d steiger 
said at the time of her confirmation last summer that she is 
concerned about the issue 
allegations that tobacco and alcohol products are being 
marketed to young people are matters of serious concern that 
deserve priority attention she said

they marched together in the civil rights army 
around martin luther king jr they call themselves friends but 
whatever remains of the relationship between marion barry and jesse 
jackson is severely strained by todays political realities 
barry is fighting for political survival as mayor of the 
nations capital and sees his old friend jackson as a formidable 
obstacle 
observers of the byzantine local political scene in washington 
speculate that whatever the mayor did or didnt say in a recent 
interview with the los angeles times stemmed from his unease over 
the fact jackson established residence in the capital in time to 
qualify for a campaign for mayor 
jesse dont want to run nothing but his mouth barry was 
quoted as telling a times reporter the mayor spent much of the 
past week trying to extinguish the political fires that his 
comments sparked 
jackson has said he believes barrys assertions that he never 
made any of the comments attributed to him in the times profile 
but jackson aides and top city officials said jackson was angry 
enough to call the newspaper and ask whether barry really made the 
remarks he was told that the interview was taperecorded 
it is easy to understand why barry may frequently be thinking 
about his former civil rights colleague 
barry and jackson who have been friends since both worked with 
king have seen their relationship put under the microscope since 
jacksons april relocation to the nations capital fueled rumors 
that he would try to unseat barry 
jackson has said repeatedly he would never run against barry 
but he left open the possibility he would enter the race if barry 
decided against seeking a fourth term 
given that jackson has not eliminated the possibility of 
running his presence has cast a heavy shadow over barrys 
reelection effort says julius hobson a former city official who 
is now an advisor to sen charles robb dva he is not an 
announced candidate but he is doing all the things that a 
candidate has always done in this town like visiting the 
ministers and that certainly makes it more difficult for barry 
barry despite trailing several rivals in fundraising is 
nonetheless predicting he can coast to reelection 
but federal prosecutors continue their investigation of barrys 
ties to a convicted drug dealer and an indictment of the mayor 
would cripple him politically and open the door for a jackson 
candidacy the thinking goes 
top city officials say jackson has indicated to them he may be 
interested in representing the city as a shadow senator on 
capitol hill the nonvoting position which would pay almost 
80000 per year is designed to serve as a platform from which to 
lobby for statehood 
ironically the latest tensions between the two old friends 
flared despite statements over several weeks from jackson 
associates that indicated he was growing less interested in running 
for mayor 
jackson recently adopted statehood as his new crusade calling 
it the major social justice issue of the day and is scheduled 
to announce a national statehood lobbying effort on monday 
in conversations with congressional leaders jackson also has 
been told that having barry at the helm of the city makes statehood 
a much tougher proposition according to jackson aides 
jesse has reminded them that maryland wasnt disenfranchised 
when governor marvin mandel went to jail said one jackson aide 
who spoke only on condition of anonymity but the problems with 
marion on the hill are obvious to jesse and he cant avoid 
thinking about them or dealing with them 
statehood works for jesse hobson says if thats what he 
really wants to do 
and for now the rest of washington from barry on down can 
only wonder about jacksons real intentions

a group of welldressed hitchhikers was there 
waiting when rose mcmurray pulled into the rolling valley mall 
parking lot in search of the warm bodies that would enable her 
to use the express lanes on the interstate and get to work on time 
its a winwin situation for everybody mcmurray says as she 
piles two riders into her car drivers get to use the 
highoccupancy vehicle or hov lanes and cut 20 minutes or more 
off from their commute through mindnumbing traffic to downtown 
washington dc passengers get a free trip 
without government direction or subsidy the informal instant 
carpooling system has evolved into a unique commuting mode that 
relieves pressure on the subsidized bus system cuts congestion and 
saves commuters money 
transportation researchers call it the springfield 
underground because it started with the opening 15 years ago of 
hov lanes down the center of i395 to the washington suburb of 
springfield va the twolane hov lanes are restricted to buses and 
cars carrying three or more passengers during rush hour 
most carpooling involves people from the same office or the same 
neighborhood or those matched by formal programs but in 
springfield and the nearby bedroom community of burke its stand 
there and take your chances 
the only other area where the instant carpooling occurs on a 
large scale is at bus stops leading to the east entrance to the bay 
bridge between oakland and san francisco according to a study by 
the urban institute 
arlee reno who heads transportation projects for the urban 
institute said he has taken a slide show on springfields 
hitchhiking commuting system to houston minneapolis seattle and 
los angeles 
but researchers caution that several conditions have to be met 
if such systems are to work among them 
at least 500 commuters in the given area 
hov lanes that save enough time to give drivers a reason to 
pick up passengers 
a parallel bus system that gives hitchhiking commuters an 
alternative if no cars show up 
one drawback of the system is the reluctance of people to climb 
into a car with a stranger but riders see little risk with three 
people in the car 
a requirement of two persons per vehicle in order to use the 
hov lanes would undoubtedly result in a much higher level of 
psychological resistance to instant carpooling reno said in a 
study of the springfield system 
the springfield underground has been so successful that 
nearly all the spaces in parkandride lots along the route are 
taken up by hitchhikers ranging from stylishly dressed single 
women to uniformed military officers heading for the pentagon 
at one lot surveyors watched 553 people get into cars with 
strangers and only 25 board buses that pass by the lot drivers 
call out their destinations and the next riders in line pile in 
ms mcmurray alternates between driving and hitching rides at 
the mall located about 20 miles southwest of downtown washington 
all we need is warm bodies for the express lane she says 
dottie cousineau head of commuter programs for fairfax county 
said the system has freed morning buses for other areas 
some riders also hitch rides in washington to get home but ms 
cousineau said the system doesnt work as well because workers have 
to get to limited pickup points including ones near the washington 
monument and at the pentagon 
ms cousineau said she has never heard of a complaint about the 
system from a driver or a rider 
i guess its because its entirely voluntary she said 
instant carpooling has fostered a new riding culture and 
etiquette the 30minute rides may feature the unfriendly silences 
more common in elevators or on the other hand convivial commutes 
that cover the gamut of political and social discussion 
on the morning after the us invasion of panama a military 
officer on his way to the pentagon discussed the timing of the 
operation on another day in another car an agricultural 
department worker criticized farm subsidies 
but the most common topics are the weather and the difficulty of 
getting to work in the nations capital 
for the commuter a roundtrip between fairfax county and 
washington can cost as much as 680 a day 240 each way on 
buses and the subway and 200 to park at a metro station with the 
ridesharing program the trip is free for the passengers 
one private lot owned by a movie house was selling parking 
stickers that included their value in movie tickets 
drivers still have to pay for gas and downtown parking but they 
get to work faster 
metropolitan transit officials like the system too although bus 
ridership has decreased on the route 
more power to them said metro spokeswoman marilyn dicus 
we all have the same goal to get more than one person in a 
vehicle

dr henry stenhouse says he started 
thinking about running for congress when he saw all the young 
relatives and friends who turned up for his 100th birthday party 
last month 
i got to thinking about the children of this country 
stenhouse said friday as he sat in his small cluttered 
ophthalmology office ive been concerned about them for a long 
time 
weve been doing a lot of bad planning in this country he 
said and its not us thats going to catch it its the 
children 
last week stenhouse who has never held public office hitched a 
ride with a visiting son for the 60mile trip to raleigh to file as 
a republican candidate for the 3rd congressional district 
his life has not been the same since 
ive never been under such a siege in my life he said as 
he answered the third phone call in less than 30 minutes ive 
had calls from everywhere people stopping by wanting to help with 
the campaign its been just wonderful 
stenhouse said he hasnt worked much on a campaign plan yet but 
expects to use a lot of wordofmouth advertising and speaking to 
groups whenever he gets the chance 
i havent had much experience with public speaking but i know 
ive got the capacity he said my father could hold an 
audience spellbound so quiet you could hear a pin drop so i know 
ive got it in me 
he acknowledged however it might be hard for me to speak 
without making some people mad 
stenhouse opposes welfare programs believes mandatory seat belt 
laws should be repealed and thinks women who have children should 
stay home to raise them 
im going to get some opposition on that one loads of it 
stenhouse said but when a woman has children she has a 
responsibility to raise them to care for them not shuttle them 
off to some daycare place you cant have it all and children 
too 
welfare he said is the responsibility of churches not 
government 
i think weve got sidetracked somehow he said the 
government should have never got into it i think its the duty of 
churches to look after the needy in their community but they 
arent doing it 
mandatory seat belt laws he said are just an example of big 
intrusive government 
the three small rooms in stenhouses office where he walks from 
home three days a week to see some of his old patients are crowded 
with files stacks of correspondence books and pamphlets the 
walls and shelves are covered with photographs and remembrances of 
a navy career that took him to china the philippines and the 
virgin islands 
the office door has a brass nameplate that was his fathers 
also a doctor near it is a color photograph of president and mrs 
bush sent to him when he turned 100 
the first vote i ever cast was for william howard taft against 
theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson in 1912 stenhouse said 
ive been involved with republican politics for a long time 
stenhouse was born in colorado on dec 7 1889 when much of the 
west was real frontier country still indians the works 
he followed his father into medicine while interning at a 
denver hospital stenhouse joined the navy as a physician he was 
in the philippines when world war i began the enemy he mainly 
fought was the influenza epidemic that wiped out thousands of 
servicemen 
when he retired from the navy in 1937 he wound up in north 
carolina where his recently widowed fatherinlaw lived stenhouse 
himself was widowed in 1983 he and his wife had five children 
stenhouse said he now spends a lot of time reading particularly 
the national review 
that bill buckley now thats a smart fellow he said he 
has had a lot of influence on my thinking of course i keep a 
dictionary right there with me so i can look up some of the words 
he uses 
stenhouse said he never expected the attention his candidacy has 
drawn interviews invitations to speak even a request to appear 
on the tonight show with johnny carson but he said it has 
energized him 
i cant help thinking that a lot of people must think like i 
do he said there is a lot of latent patriotism and common 
sense in this country but its going to take something to break it 
open maybe this can help do that 
thus far the only other candidate to file for the congressional 
seat is the incumbent martin lancaster a democrat 
stenhouse said if he wins he promises not to serve more than 
two terms that would have him retiring shortly after his 105th 
birthday

gen colin l powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff said sunday the armed forces offer black americans 
equal opportunity more so than any other form of endeavor in our 
society 
powell the first black to be named the nations highestranking 
uniformed officer also said he does not believe the allvolunteer 
us military has become disproportionately black 
i dont think its out of proportion he said adding that 
anybody who is willing to serve qualified to serve proud to 
serve should be allowed to serve 
blacks currently comprise about 21 percent of the armed forces 
compared with about 12 percent of the overall us population 
powell was interviewed on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley on the eve of the holiday marking the birthday of the 
late martin luther king jr 
he was asked whether he considers the us military a 
meritocracy and equalopportunity employer 
powell replied more so than any other form of endeavor in our 
society ive very proud of what we have done in the military over 
the years and i think for the most part it is a meritocracy you 
are not limited by anything but your own ability 
in another development the washingtonbased american council on 
education said in a report for release monday that because of 
increased selectivity and benefits within the armed forces the 
military is becoming more competitive with colleges in recruiting 
highability collegeeligible blacks 
it cited a congressional budget office study finding that in 
1987 black and white recruits tended to come from different 
socioeconomic strata within their respective populations with 
black recruits coming disproportionately from areas with 
aboveaverage black incomes and bettereducated black adults 
only 44 percent of black male activeduty recruits in 1987 
came from areas in the bottom half of the income distribution for 
black families compared with almost 55 percent of white 
recruits the report said 
this recruitment pattern of african americans represented a 
marked change from 1980 when black recruits were drawn much more 
heavily from lower income levels the council said in a report on 
minorities in higher education

thirtythree months after the first jurors 
were summoned to weigh the mcmartin preschool case verdicts are 
nearly complete in the longest costliest criminal trial ever held 
in the united states 
the molestation trial of raymond buckey and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey has become a crucible for the justice system and a 
soulwrenching ordeal for participants 
buckey 31 and his 63yearold mother await the jurys word 
which could come this week on whether they will be found guilty 
or innocent of 65 counts of child molestation and conspiracy 
parents and their youngsters who once attended the mcmartin 
preschool in manhattan beach also wait anxiously for the outcome 
when the 12 jurors retired for the weekend after eight weeks of 
deliberation they had delivered 52 sealed verdicts to superior 
court judge william pounders and sent him a question that suggested 
their verdicts may be as complex as the entire mcmartin case 
considering the single count of conspiracy which names both 
buckey and his mother the jury asked can we find one defendant 
guilty and one not guilty 
pounders is expected to tell the jury that the answer is yes 
they can convict one alleged conspirator without the other because 
there are a number of unnamed coconspirators alleged in the 
charges 
the jurors who have the day off monday for martin luther king 
jrs birthday were to resume deliberations tuesday thirteen 
verdicts remain to be delivered 
pounders anxious to learn the results and have the verdicts 
recorded while 12 jurors remain seated considered opening the 
sealed envelopes and disclosing them to the public 
but lawyers on both sides persuaded him to wait until the jurys 
task is concluded jurors themselves have expressed fears that 
disclosure of partial verdicts would subject them to community 
pressure if any of their decisions proved unpopular 
i dont mean to betray them said the judge theyve done 
such a great job but im concerned with having 12 jurors here at 
the end 
the trials length forced the judge to use all six alternates to 
maintain 12 jurors on the panel there are no alternates left if a 
juror should fall ill and a mistrial would have to be called the 
52 verdicts already reached are not official until they are 
announced in court and affirmed by each juror 
we have 78 percent of the verdicts in pounders said but if 
i lose one juror i lose all 52 verdicts which is why im on the 
razors edge 
those familiar with the case dont believe the verdicts will end 
the bizarre saga that has spread itself over nearly seven years 
leaving wrecked lives in its wake 
seven people were originally arrested in 1984 but after a 
twoyear preliminary hearing charges against the other five were 
dropped 
appeals could follow any convictions at least one book is 
planned on the case no matter what the outcome 
this case in my view has poisoned everyone who had contact 
with it pounders said some months ago two witnesses had died 
some of the children involved in the proceedings are now 
adolescents 
more than 1000 items have been entered in evidence and 124 
witnesses have testified during the nearly threeyear trial the 
cost has soared past 15 million 
deputy district attorney lael rubin has said she believes the 
cost is worthwhile because it has alerted the public to the problem 
of child molestation 
buckeys attorney danny davis called the mcmartin trial a 
cottage industry that provided a showcase for experts to build 
reputations for lawyers to build careers and for tv news shows to 
outrate one another 
my heartfelt feeling is that the truth never had a chance 
davis said we rushed into the glitz of a fantastic media event

east germanys largest opposition political 
party said sunday that it will open talks on unification with west 
germany if it wins national elections in may 
tens of thousands of east germans demonstrated sunday against 
the communists in at least four cities to keep up the pressure on 
communist premier hans modrows shaky coalition government 
forty years of communist rule are enough and lies 
corruption and treason marked the communist state read two of 
the banners at a rally in east berlin several people waved west 
german flags 
protesters also rallied in magdeburg karlmarxstadt and suhl 
according to east german television 
the leading opposition party social democrats originally 
organized the east berlin demonstration to pay tribute to two 
german communists murdered 71 years ago the two rosa luxemburg 
and karl liebknecht have become martyrs for german leftists 
several hundred thousand people across east germany took part in 
various ceremonies marking their deaths jan 15 1919 for the 
first time the events were not controlled by the communist party 
in a party platform statement released after a meeting the 
social democrats said sunday that if they lead the government after 
elections on may 6 they will open talks with bonn on the 
necessary steps for german unity 
the statement said our political goal is a united germany 
whatever is possible immediately should happen immediately 
the social democrats said 
the 500 delegates said german unity must come as part of an 
overall process of european integration and it must have the 
consent of neighboring countries 
on saturday the west german social democrats promised campaign 
support for their sister party in east germany which has 32000 
members and has emerged as a top contender to win east germanys 
first open elections 
the far larger new forum opposition group with an estimated 
200000 members remains a diffuse organization with little 
interest in becoming a formal political party 
the communist party still has 14 million members despite a 
wave of resignations and has a grip on businesses bureaucracy and 
the news media 
even before sundays announcement by the social democrats the 
two german states were well on their way toward unification 
political cultural and business ties are growing daily in a 
spirit of cooperation unthinkable before the ouster of hardline 
communist leader erich honecker on oct 18 the opening of the 
berlin wall in november and a series of democratic reforms 
daimlerbenz chief edzard reuter whose conglomerate makes 
trucks mercedesbenz cars aerospace products and electronics 
equipment said he will start working with east german leaders even 
before the elections

lincoln savings and loan executive charles h 
keating jr said sunday that taxpayers could have been saved half a 
trillion dollars in savings and loan losses if regulators had 
listened to the five senators for whom he raised campaign money 
keating who is a central figure in the sampl crisis and an 
accompanying congressional ethics scandal involving the five 
senators blamed regulators for the collapse of lincoln and 
hundreds of other thrifts 
had they listened to the senators and had they listened to me 
there wouldnt be mess today he said on nbctvs meet the 
press show im convinced that the cost of this debacle is 
going to exceed 500 billion never has so much misery and 
economic disaster been caused by so few men 
keating defended raising 13 million from associates for 
political campaigns and related causes of sens dennis deconcini 
dariz john mccain rariz alan cranston dcalif donald w 
riegle jr dmich and john glenn dohio 
edwin gray a former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board and federal sampl examiners told a house committee last fall 
they were pressured by the senators in a pair of meetings in 
deconcinis office in 1987 to ease their regulation of lincoln 
i wanted to be involved in the process keating said sunday 
it was particularly important how the savings and loan industry 
went it you want to support the system you have to in my case 
it seems to me raise funds and support the people 
since the disclosures of the campaign gifts and the meeting with 
regulators the five senators have tried to disassociate themselves 
from keating saying they didnt know at the time the nature of 
lincolns loans and investments all five are now the subject of a 
senate ethics committee inquiry 
asked sunday if the meetings between the senators and bank board 
officials over lincoln was unusual keating said his problem with 
the regulators were more than ordinary 
it was a problem of taking down a savings and loan which was 
critical to the economy and employment in those areas in which the 
senators served he said 
claiming that the irvine califbased lincoln was being 
operated in an unsafe and unsound manner the bank board seized 
control of it last april two years after examiners first 
recommended shutting it down 
regulators now estimate that its loss of federally insured taxes 
through what the government claims in a suit were fraudulent loans 
and racketeering investment practices will cost taxpayers up to 2 
billion 
keating in turn has sued the government claiming its takeover 
of lincoln was part of a vendetta that regulators waged against him 
because he was operating lincoln as an investment bank rather than 
as a traditional home mortgage lender 
it operated profitably until the government confiscated it 
he said sunday it seems to me that somethings wrong for the 
government that takes away a profitable property theres no loss 
thats ascertainable at this point in lincoln

the search for a negotiated settlement 
of the cambodian war has quickened amid reports of khmer rouge 
guerrilla advances from the jungles 
deputy foreign minister igor rogachev of the soviet union on 
friday announced after talks in beijing that the soviet union and 
china have agreed the united nations should play a very major 
role in a cambodian settlement 
the soviet union has been arming the vietnameseinstalled 
cambodian government and china arms the guerrillas 
the soviet announcement increased hopes that are centered on 
australias proposal for a un interim authority in cambodia 
which diplomats call the most promising peace plan in years 
the soviet union china and the three other permanent members of 
the un security council will discuss that and other cambodian 
peace initiatives at a meeting in paris on monday and tuesday the 
plan would require approval by the members which also include the 
united states britain and france 
fears of a khmer rouge return have intensified since september 
when vietnam said it withdrew the last of its troops aiding the 
hanoiinstalled government 
the khmer rouge claimed last week that its forces hit the two 
largest cities phnom penh and battambang phnom penh sources said 
minor explosons went off in the capital on jan 5 and 6 
the government said the guerrillas also struck near battambang 
the provincial capital in the northwest the guerrillas said they 
set parts of the city ablaze but the reports could not be verified 
western diplomats said the effect of the attacks was more 
psychological than strategic and involved little actual fighting 
they predicted more strikes in coming weeks designed not to 
overthrow the government but to bolster bargaining power at peace 
talks 
after toppling the usbacked lon nol government in april 1975 
the khmer rouge emptied the cities and banished residents to labor 
camps in the countryside 
hundreds of thousands were executed died of torture or disease 
in labor camps during the 3year rule of pol pots blackclad 
fanatics 
vietnams invasion of december 1978 drove the khmer rouge to the 
thai border but aid from thailand and china revived the guerrillas 
and they formed a coalition that includes the noncomunist forces 
of prince norodom sihanouk and son sann 
if we let the situation persist and the khmer rouge gain more 
ground they might harden their stance at the negotiating table 
said ek sereywath a spokesman in sihanouks office in bangkok 
the australian proposal says a un authority should govern 
cambodia until a free election can be held 
foreign minister ali alatas of indonesia on thursday praised the 
proposal because among the many issues unsettled at the 
international conference on cambodia last summer one of the most 
difficult to overcome was the question of an interim administering 
authority 
in that conference premier hun sen of cambodia rejected 
guerrilla demands for a transitional coalition government because 
of the inclusion of the khmer rouge 
other unresolved issues alatas said include verification of 
vietnams claimed troop pullout a truce and a halt to outside 
military aid to the combatants and measures to prevent a return of 
the khmer rouge terror 
deputy foreign secretary michael costello of australia will try 
to gather support for the plan in visits to france the united 
nations and the united states 
the main antagonists at any talks will be hun sen and khmer 
rouge leader khieu samphan 
their will to fight has not weakened 
in a speech jan 6 hun sen urged authorities to step up 
recruitment at all costs we must strengthen the armed forces 
without the armed forces we cannot survive 
the khmer rouge radio said the government surely will fall and 
told citizens to flee immediately in order to live

at least 25 people died in the capital of the 
azerbaijan republic after ethnic rioting broke out overnight and 
dozens more people were killed as the unrest spread across the 
republic official media said sunday 
extra internal security troops were flown to the southern 
republic to try to quell the violence and a military commander of 
one besieged area called for a state of emergency the television 
news program seven days reported 
a witness in the city of baku where the violence began 
described a street awash in blood and said victims there included 
two women tossed from balconies 
it was the bloodiest clash in nearly two years between 
azerbaijanis and armenians who are locked in a feud over 
nagornokarabakh an enclave populated mainly by armenians but 
which is controlled by azerbaijan 
most armenians are christians most azerbaijanis are shiite 
moslems 
the violence was set off by news that an azerbaijani had been 
killed and another wounded by armenians in azerbaijans capital 
baku 
radio moscow said the incidents were announced at a rally 
saturday night in bakus central square that was attended by about 
150000 people 
calls were made at the rally to drive the armenians out of the 
city the radio moscow correspondent reported from the caspian 
sea port of 17 million people among the crowd antiarmenian 
slogans were shouted and then the most terrible thing of all began 
the pogroms 
the official tass news agency said 25 people were killed in 
baku radio moscow quoted local interior ministry officials as 
saying most victims were armenians 
late sunday tass said the violence had spread to the 
shaumyanovsk and khanlar regions of azerbaijan near 
nagornokarabakh and that there were tens of dead and wounded 
from both nationalities 
seven days said thousands of armed azerbaijani militants 
were massing in the two districts and that armenians also bearing 
arms were being transported there 
the military commander in shaumyanovsk maj gen yu a 
kosolapov called for the introduction of a state of emergency 
seven days said 
two helicopters were shot at with artillery guns and a 
lieutenant aboard one was wounded highways and railroads to 
nagornokarabakh were blocked and shipments of food and fuel were 
not reaching the district according to soviet tv 
it said four soldiers of the interior ministry who are 
responsible for internal security have disappeared since saturday 
and that a fifth was killed 
the fate of armenians taken hostage by azerbaijanis including 
the entire communist party and government leadership in 
shaumyanovsk was unknown according to the reports 
a russian resident of baku told the associated press by 
telephone she saw at least two armenian women in torn 
bloodspattered clothes hurled from the balconies of upper floors 
of apartment houses on lenin street 
in front of the office she said an old woman who looked like 
an armenian was shot pointblank in the head and chest by a mob 
armed with shotguns and pistols 
you cant imagine ive just seen death for the first time in 
my life said the woman who asked not to be identified by name 
for fear she would become the target of reprisals she said lenin 
street was covered with blood 
about 20000 ethnic armenians mainly elderly people live in 
baku although ethnic violence in the last two years has caused an 
exodus of azerbaijans and armenians back to their home republics 
alexander argumanyan a press officer for the armenian national 
movement said at least 250000 people gathered in yerevan the 
armenian capital sunday after hearing of the violence 
he said vano syragedlyan a member of the movements 
directorate urged armenians who own firearms to volunteer to be 
flown by helicopter to two districts of azerbaijan near the 
disputed region of nagornokarabakh 
radio moscow said the strife was kindled in baku a major 
petroleumproducing center when two azerbaijanis visited an 
armenian family at midday and demanded they leave town the 
armenians had an ax and the azerbaijanis were hurt in a struggle 
and taken to a hospital 
one died and the other was in serious condition the radio said 
the news enraged the crowd that gathered later in baku 
alesker siyabov a spokesman for the azerbaijani peoples front 
said the rally voted to establish a council for national 
security designed to protect azerbaijanis 
radio moscow said police had 1500 men on patrol 
it was not possible to avert so many sad and tragic cases but 
in dozens of cases the militia police saved people the baku 
correspondent said in other cases he said azerbaijanis saved 
armenian neighbors by sheltering them 
radio moscow said 53 apartments presumably those of armenians 
were wrecked in the violence and that the situation in the city 
1240 miles southeast of moscow remained tense 
the republic is on the boil hearts are bleeding and the 
militia is trying to do everything it can the correspondent said 
he said he had been told that reinforcements were on the way 
but what guarantee is there that the frightful thing which took 
place yesterday evening and last night will not be repeated 
a duty officer at the azerbaijani communist partys central 
committee kamal abdulayev said the number of victims was unclear 
the duty officer at the republics interior ministry which is 
responsible for law enforcement said baku was and is normal 
he hung up before he could be asked his name 
azerbaijani peoples front spokesman khalid mukhtarov denied 
knowing of any rioting when told that pravda the communist party 
daily had printed the tass dispatch about the hooligan rampages 
he charged that the newspaper always printed lies about azerbaijan 
the armenianazerbaijani dispute is the bloodiest of the many 
ethnic conflicts facing soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
the last major rioting occurred in february 1988 when 
azerbaijanis attacked armenians in the city of sumgait near baku 
thirtytwo people died most of them armenians 
nagornokarabakh a territory of about 160000 people has been 
controlled by azerbaijan since 1923 
in addition to nagornokarabakh azerbaijanis also have rioted 
over demands they be united with their shiite moslem breathren in 
the neighboring iranian azerbaijani region over the new years 
holiday weekend azerbaijani rioters tore down border fences and 
put guard towers and communications lines out of commission

decent housing for the poor and half for the medellin cartels war 
on the government the communique said 
there have been no ransom demands and it is not known that the

rep patricia schroeder said sunday she doubts 
her bill to allow female us military personnel into combat will 
get very far in congress with most members up for reelection next 
november 
they want to duck waffle tap dance and everything else 
schroeder dcolo said of her colleagues on cbstvs face the 
nation show i think theyre terrified to take the next step 
because of the emotionalism and irrationality surrounding the 
issue 
most members of congress she said fear that if they voted to 
allow women in combat opponents would campaign against them as 
the congressman who voted to put your daughter in combat boots 
a member of the house armed services committee schroeder 
announced after the us invasion of panama last month she would 
introduce the bill when congress reconvenes jan 23 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the same committee in the 
senate has said he opposes changing the current law which 
prohibits the navy and air force from assigning women to combat 
ships or planes 
while the law does not explicitly include the army assistant 
secretary of defense christopher jehn said on the same program 
sunday that the army takes its cue from the statute that 
congress doesnt want women in combat 
jehn said there are senior military officials on both sides of 
the question but that the pentagon itself has no official view 
its really an emotional political issue that we think needs 
to be resolved in the congress not by policy edict in the defense 
department he said 
controversy flared over the role of us women in combat during 
the panama invasion when presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
praised the commander of a military police unit capt linda bray 
for her role in a battle at a panamanian defense forces kennel 
fitzwater implied she had led the military action but military 
officials said later she had directed the operation by radio from a 
command post a halfmile away and then rushed to the scene when 
fighting broke out 
schroeder said the panama invasion proved that men and women 
could go into combat together and bond and that men had no 
problems taking orders from women senior to them in rank or command 
this is a generation that grew up playing soccer together 
she said they really do see women as teammates

general motors corp announced sunday it had 
reached a tentative agreement with a hungarian governmentowned 
automaker to jointly build cars and engines at a plant under 
construction in the eastern european nation 
the deal makes gm the first us automaker to invest in eastern 
europe which has undergone tremendous political and economic 
liberalization in recent months said rl theis gms 
detroitbased international spokesman the company is to invest 
150 million in the dea 
the agreement between general motors europe and raba hungarys 
stateowned manufacturer of trucks diesel engines and axles could 
lead to a joint venture to build engines and cars at a plant in 
szentgotthard near the austrian border beginning in 1992 theis 
said 
the tentative agreement spells out the full intent of the 
joint venture now both parties have to finalize all the details 
and actually form the joint venture theis said 
although gm is the first us automaker to announce an 
agreement japans suzuki motor co announced tuesday it would 
build a 1389 million assembly plant near budapest hungarys 
capital to make suzuki swift subcompact cars beginning in 1992 
gm europe president robert j eaton and raba managing director 
ferenc romvari signed the protocol saturday in budapest before 
hungarian deputy prime minister peter medgyessy 
as these markets continue to open up investing in plants 
there is becoming a more attractive business proposition eaton 
said in a statement this new strategic partnership would provide 
us with better access to the growing car market in hungary and 
elsewhere in eastern europe 
under the tentative agreement gm would have a 67 percent 
interest in the szentgotthard plant and would be allowed to appoint 
management staff the plant would create about 880 jobs in the 
western hungarian town theis said 
the worlds largest automaker said about 200000 engines would 
be turned out yearly most of which would be exported for use in 
gms opel and vauxhall cars the rest would go into the opel kadett 
model to be built at the hungarian plant 
theis said current plans call for only one carassembly shift 
and an annual production of 15000 vehicles for sale in hungary and 
other eastern european markets 
market conditions will dictate whether an additional shift is 
required he said last year opel sold 6600 cars in hungary 
the profitable european branches of both gm and ford motor co 
have been bolstering sagging us operations recently chrysler 
corp also sells cars in europe but does not run independent 
manufacturing plants there 
last month gm agreed to acquire half of the car business of 
swedens saabscania ab for about 600 million that announcement 
came on the heels of rival fords acquisition of great britains 
jaguar plc for 25 billion of the big three ford has the largest 
presence in europe 
on thursday ford spokeswoman lin cummins said the worlds 
secondlargest automaker had no negotiations in the works involving 
eastern europe but was watching the market carefully 
there would seem to be a good chance that multinational 
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in 
the course of the next several years cummins said

a renegade black catholic priest on sunday 
declared martin luther king jr a saint but vatican officials said 
the slain civil rights leader was ineligible for canonization 
the rev george a stallings told a congregation of nearly 900 
people that to canonize king was to ratify what god had already 
done 
martin luther king jr is a saint by virtue of his life work 
his communion with god and his sharing in the joys of everlasting 
life said stallings 
in a lavish threehour service stallings said king was a 
doctor and martyr and exhorted the worshippers to follow kings 
example by dedicating their lives to a cause 
stallings is prohibited from giving communion and performing 
other duties as a priest since breaking from the catholic church in 
july to form the imani temple african american catholic 
congregation 
vatican officials in rome said king would not be eligible for 
sainthood even if the ceremony was performed by a sanctioned priest 
reverend king may have been a great man but because he was 
not a catholic that judgment must be left to others outside the 
church said a vatican official 
they say king wasnt a catholic but there are saints who 
arent catholic said imani temple spokesman william marshall 
catholic information center researchers say pope john paul ii 
has named 250 saints and as many as 1500 candidates are being 
considered

a roman catholic leader on 
sunday praised president alfredo cristianis efforts to bring to 
justice those responsible for killing six jesuit priests 
but monsignor gregorio rosa chavez san salvadors auxiliary 
bishop said much more needs to be done to end the cycle of 
violence in the country 
now that mr cristiani has made public the names of those 
implicated the possibility that el salvador will regain confidence 
in its institutions has grown the roman catholic leader said in 
his homily 
however its not enough to punish some it is necessary to 
completely revise the criteria to define who are really enemies of 
the people and enemies of the nation he said this seems like 
a good start but its not the end 
cristiani announced saturday that an army colonel three 
lieutenants and five enlisted men are the prime suspects in the 
november massacre 
eight of the suspects he said have been placed at the 
disposition of the special investigative commission a ninth 
suspect a private deserted from the armed forces last month and 
was a fugitive he said 
cristiani did not say specifically that the eight suspects had 
been arrested but sources close to the investigation said the men 
were indeed under arrest they have not yet been charged 
the colonel was identified as guillermo alfredo benavides 
moreno he is the highestranking military officer to be officially 
accused of a human rights abuse crime in el salvadors 10yearold 
civil war 
rosa chavez said the government has insisted that this be 
treated simply as a group of members of the army who have blemished 
the honor of the military he added it is difficult for us to 
accept this conclusion 
we realize that the mission of the church especially in the 
countryside promoting human rights is misunderstood by the 
military world the bishop said 
the new york times reported sunday that an american officer was 
being questioned about the case the newspaper quoting 
unidentified officials said the officer may have had advance 
knowledge of plans to kill the priests 
military men implicated in serious crimes have often gone 
unpunished in el salvador many observers contended the jesuit 
massacre was only being prosecuted because of international 
pressure especially from the united states 
cristiani was to visit washington this week but postponed the 
trip a government spokesman said sunday cristiani changed his 
plans because un secretary general javier perez de cuellar was 
not able to meet with him as scheduled the spokesman said 
no military officer has been convicted of a human rights abuse 
crime in the civil war although rightist death squads sponsored or 
tolerated by the armed forces killed thousands of suspected 
leftists in the early 1980s 
in 1980 four churchwomen were killed in el salvador five 
national guardsmen were convicted for their murder 
the leftist farabundo marti national liberation front has waged 
a 10year civil war against a succession of usbacked 
governments the government frequently blames the rebels for 
atrocities and initially said the jesuits may have been killed by 
the rebels 
many voices have demanded that other equally condemnable acts 
that have been attributed to the guerrillas be clarified with the 
same zeal as the deaths of the jesuits rosa chavez said 
the bishop cited the resurgence of death squads who are believed 
to have killed many union activists and leftofcenter politicians 
he said it is urgent to investigate completely the delicate 
question of the criminal death squads whose resurgence does not 
favor the forces of peace 
on nov 16 armed men broke into the central american university 
campus residence of jesuit priests and educators ignacio ellacuria 
ignacio martinbaro segundo montes amado lopez juan ramon moreno 
and joaquin lopez lopez 
the six were taken to the yard behind the building and shot to 
death with assault rifles 
the assailants also killed the jesuits housekeeper julia 
ramos and her 15yearold daughter celina 
ellacuria was rector of the central american university one of 
the regions most respected institutions of higher learning 
martinbaro was its vicerector 
rosa chavez also condemned the killings of hector oqueli 
colindres deputy secretarygeneral of the leftist national 
revolutionary movement oqueli was reportedly kidnapped in 
guatemala and his body was found friday night with a gunshot wound 
in the head 
the government of guatemala has promised to investigate but has 
said anything about what organizations or individuals it might 
suspect 
some leftist politicians said they believe the oqueli killing to 
be the work of salvadoran and guatemalan death squads working 
together

a number of soviet moslems escaped into 
iran by using inflated tire tubes to float across the araks river 
that separates the two countries irans official islamic republic 
news agency reported sunday 
irna monitored in nicosia did not say how many soviet moslems 
entered iran during the crossing in subzero temperatures saturday 
it reported earlier that 12 such crossings have occurred since 
riots involving shiite moslems in soviet azerbaijan broke out dec 
31 
the report of the escapes came as official soviet media said at 
least 25 people died in baku the azerbaijani capital after 
rioting between azerbaijanis and the mainly christian armenian 
minority broke out overnight reports said the unrest spread across 
the republic sunday 
shiites in the soviet province are demanding closer links with 
their fellow moslems in northwest iran amid the wave of reform that 
has been sweeping eastern europe some militants want total union 
irna said that about 1000 soviet moslems congregated on the 
soviet bank of the araks saturday shouting greetings and religious 
slogans to a similar number or iranian azerbaijanis gathered on the 
other side 
such gatherings are reported frequently in the iranian media 
tehran television also monitored in nicosia earlier showed a 
gathering of about 1000 soviet moslems across the river friday 
the soviet azerbaijanis share a common culture language and 
religion with their iranian cousins who constitute about onethird 
of irans 55 million population 
the other conflict in the southern republic between militant 
soviet azerbaijanis and soviet armenians is over who should govern 
the mostly armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh in azerbaijan 
irans official media has made no mention of the bloodshed 
reported in nagornokarabakh and baku soviet azerbaijans capital 
the soviets have long been fearful of moslem unrest along the 
southern border with iran but president hashemi rafsanjanis 
government in tehran which has good links with moscow apparently 
does not want to stir up islamic fervor in the region 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati said saturday his 
country would welcome soviet moslems who wish to visit iran irna 
reported 
earlier this month soviet demonstrators calling for the 
reunification of the soviet and iranian azerbaijans went on a 
rampage for several days tearing down border fences guard towers 
and communication lines 
azerbaijan was once completely ruled by iran and was divided in 
1828 
in 1941 the red army invaded northern iran and set up a 
shortlived puppet republic after world war ii but the soviets 
pulled out in 1946 under international pressure

fridays big drop on world stock markets and increasing worries 
about inflation and interest rates gave investors a jolt and 
analysts say the news isnt likely to improve soon 
in tokyo a weak yen and soaring interest rates caused the 
nikkei average of 225 stocks to slide 65336 points to 3751677 on 
friday the biggest oneday point decline in the index since 
november 1987 
japanese markets could remain weak at least until elections for 
the lower house of parliament next month experts said 
news later friday on wall street that us wholesale price 
inflation hit an eightyear high of 48 percent in 1989 exacerbated 
the decline the dow jones industrial average plunged 7146 points 
or 259 percent the biggest oneday point drop since octobers 
190point plunge 
inflation fears also depressed stocks in london frankfurts 
stock exchange avoided a selloff but inflation worries have been 
pushing up interest rates in west germany 
the global trend toward higher interest rates threatens to 
weaken a us economy many analysts already believe is bordering on 
recession high interest rates and a weak economy dont bode well 
for the stock market 
its a very good time to be cautious said robert brusca 
chief financial economist at nikko securities co international 
inc in new york 
investors should get a respite monday because japans markets 
are closed for a national holiday and the us government bond 
market is closed for martin luther king jr day 
that could limit selling in stocks because investors usually 
look to put their money in bonds when they unload stocks said 
kathleen stephansen senior economist at the brokerage donaldson 
lufkin amp jenrette securities corp 
us investors may have to wait several weeks for positive news 
stephansen said sunday the economy remains very weak hurting the 
outlook for corporate profits but the federal reserve cant lower 
interest rates to stimulate the economy because inflation remains 
stubbornly high she said 
thats the worst kind of situation for the stock market 
stephansen said 
strength in the tokyo market helped stabilize world markets in 
the aftermath of the 1987 crash and last octobers minicrash but 
the news from japan lately has been negative the nikkei average 
has fallen almost 1400 points or 37 percent in the first seven 
sessions of the new year 
the yen has weakened because of concerns that the ruling 
probusiness liberal democratic party might lose its majority in 
the lower house of parliament next month the currencys weakness 
forces japan to pay more for imports of fuel and raw materials 
putting pressure on inflation and interest rates 
the united states is particularly vulnerable to higher interest 
rates abroad because the country needs big inflows of foreign 
capital to finance its trade deficit but over the past year us 
interest rates have declined while rates overseas have risen 
making investments abroad more attractive 
there really isnt that much of an incentive to continue 
flowing their moneys into the us economy said samuel d kahan 
chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities 
inc

nationwide sunday on the eve of what would have been his 61st 
birthday and the slain civil rights leaders widow called on 
president bush to help unify america 
coretta scott king delivered her annual state of the dream 
address at ebenezer baptist church where her husband was pastor 
before about 1000 people including such civil rights leaders as 
the revs jesse jackson and joseph lowery 
mrs king reflected on the dramatic social changes of 1989 in 
other parts of the world and her husbands philosophy of civil 
disobedience 
the cataclysmic changes we have seen in eastern europe in 
china and in south africa since last year have deep roots in this 
very pulpit she said 
mrs king noting that bush is to deliver his state of the union 
address in a few days recalled a state of the union speech in the 
1960s by thenpresident johnson 
johnson captured the imagination of the american people just 
by saying three little words we shall overcome mrs king said 
a quarter of a century later president bush has the same 
opportunity she said he can help unify america if he will 
break with the past by ending the arms race and working for 
programs to provide jobs and educational opportunities for all 
americans 
if he will avoid the kind of military entanglements that 
destroyed johnsons war on poverty he can unify america and lead 
the world to a higher destiny mrs king said 
jack kemp us secretary of housing and urban development 
presented mrs king with a large photograph of a chinese student 
standing in beijings tiananmen square holding a sign reading we 
shall overcome 
the dream lives on not only here but throughout the world 
kemp said 
mrs king called on king supporters to carry on her husbands 
dream 
lets be clear that the future depends on us and our 
determination to do gods will she said if you take nothing 
else away from here today let it be a conviction that you can make 
a difference

efforts to stop the referendum went against what king stood for 
you have to remember dr kings part of his movement was to 
get people the right to vote so now that the people have said

go against some of the principles said the rev warren stewart

author salman rushdie pressed his publishers to 
bring out a paperback edition of the satanic verses arguing in 
an interview published monday that moslem hostility toward the book 
is totally misplaced 
rushdie who has been in hiding under police guard since irans 
leaders ordered his death 11 months ago was quoted by the guardian 
newspaper as saying he anticipated his plight would continue 
one would wish the thing to come to an end he was quoted as 
telling the london daily but im not the maker of the problem 
i think if some of the people who protested about the book 
took the trouble to read it they would see that it is not 
unsympathetic to them he was quoted as saying 
more than 12 million hardcover copies of the novel have been 
sold since september 1988 but viking penguin has yet to bring out 
a paperback edition 
the paperback should be published rushdie was quoted as 
saying as for my own feelings you can draw your own 
conclusions 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared the book to be blasphemous 
to islam and on feb 15 urged moslems to kill the indianborn 
british author the iranian leadership also offered a 52 million 
bounty 
iranian leaders who succeeded khomeini after his death in june 
have not withdrawn the death threat 
it would be impossible not to be affected by this degree of 
hostility which is totally misplaced rushdie born a moslem in 
india was quoted as saying i am not the enemy of my own people 
i do not feel like the enemy of my people 
rushdie declined to discuss his security arrangements but was 
quoted as saying you shouldnt assume i have very much freedom 
at all 
rushdie 42 said he is writing a childrens novel that he hopes 
to finish in march and said he is buoyed by support from friends 
and readers 
its nice to know there is something other than anger aimed at 
me he was quoted as saying i do get a great many letters of 
support including some from moslems whove read the book

aid as well as 15 million that will be used to train polish

guarantee by the japanese exportimport bank for japanese 
investments in poland

senior polish finance ministry official who declined to be named 
but the official said the 150 million that japan has pledged to 
a stabilization fund to support the transformation of the zloty

pledged to bring several hundred poles to japan for training 
particularly in the banking field and quality control sector

japanese during kaifus visit but no agreements are expected to be 
signed

investment fund to guarantee japanese investments in poland the

police made a practice of searching young blacks 
and hispanics in sweeps of their workingclass neighborhoods even 
before charles and carol stuart were shot more than 50 people said 
in accounts published sunday 
fifteen of those surveyed by the boston sunday globe said they 
were strip searched by police officers without being arrested a 
practice residents of the citys mission hill section say was also 
widespread after the oct 23 stuart shootings 
young people told the newspaper that searches occurred prior to 
the shootings in a variety of situations throughout workingclass 
sections of the mattapan roxbury and dorchester neighborhoods 
questions about the legality of police searches were first 
raised last summer but have become more prevalent amid allegations 
that police violated privacy rights during their dragnet in mission 
hill in the stuart case 
johnny saldana 16 of roxbury said that before police searched 
him in front of a high school in early november they asked the 
names of his family members and whether he had ever been convicted 
of a crime 
they stripped me saldana said they pulled off my jacket 
they made me take off my pants they checked my pants it was 
awful like i was a criminal which im not im a b student i 
should be treated as an adult 
raymond bowder 14 also of roxbury said he was walking from 
his aunts house with two friends in late october when a police 
cruiser screeched to a halt in front of them 
they were searching us and one of my friends said what are 
you doing bowder said 
they said shut up and pull your pants down i said what 
they made me pull my underwear down too there were like four to 
six people watching bowder said 
charles ogletree a professor at harvard law school said such 
searches clearly violated the us constitution 
i havent heard any case where it sounds like police have 
followed the letter or the spirit of the law ogletree said 
they seem to think that the mere presence of a person on the 
street or mere fear is justification for stopping searching 
removing clothing taking items from people 
police commissioner francis roache said he would personally 
oversee the investigation of any complaints arising from the 
searches 
there are going to be occasions when officers cant go back 
to textbooks when making stops roache said id like to use 
these cases to get back on track if were off track if even one 
person had their trousers lowered and there was no reason for 
suspicion that would really concern me 
extensive searches were also conducted after stuart told 
authorities a black gunman forced his way into the white couples 
car as they left a hospital birthing class then robbed and shot 
them 
stuart committed suicide on jan 4 and black man police sources 
had said was a prime suspect in carol stuarts death and stuarts 
wounding was cleared 
ogletree said searches as part of police sweeps are illegal 
unless police have a detailed description of a suspect and frisk 
only the person whom they reasonably suspect committed the crime 
you have to enforce the law in roxbury the same way you would 
in brookline an upperincome suburb ogletree said

new mexico had 55 bustling uranium 
mines in 1978 the most in the nation now it has none 
the states last active uranium mine chevron resources cos 
mount taylor mine near grants ceased mining and production friday 
because of low uranium prices a spokesman said 
we are putting the mine on standby santana gonzalez said 
the ventilation pump systems and hoisting facilities will be 
maintained 
the underground mount taylor mine had employed 180 people he 
said of those 97 will be laid off 15 found jobs elsewhere and 
the remainder will be retained gonzalez said 
employees will come back to the mine on monday for a briefing 
on benefits he said from his chevron corp office in santa fe 
jean fisher executive vice president of the grants chamber of 
commerce said her community was saddened by the layoffs 
its hard to stay upbeat when things like this happen she 
said it just trickles down to all of us in the community 
hopefully well get something else in thats what we need 
and were working on it maybe well advertise as a retirement 
community ms fisher said 
frank kottlowski director of the new mexico bureau of mines and 
mineral resources in socorro said new mexicos employment in the 
uranium mining industry peaked at 7000 in 1979 
but the mines started closing as uranium prices tumbled 
bob daniel president of chevron resources the mining and 
geothermal subsidiary of chevron corp said the uscanada free 
trade agreement and the entrance of china and the soviet union into 
the uranium marketplace have forced uranium spot market prices down 
to less than 10 a pound the lowest in history 
a pound of uranium sold for 4370 in 1978 
uranium would have to sell in the 20apound range for the 
mount taylor mine to remain open gonzalez said 
kottlowski said these indeed are dark days for the us uranium 
industry 
with the present conditions and the federal government not 
being very helpful not passing restrictions on imports i dont 
see how it could come back for quite a while he said there 
are so many vast resources in other parts of the world 
chevron resources which announced last august it would close 
the mount taylor mine unless a buyer or partner were found is 
continuing to discuss the sale of the mine with potential buyers 
gonzalez said 
sen jeff bingaman dnm said the pumping at the mine will 
prevent the mine from being flooded by underground water in the 
area 
this will ensure that a precious resource is not lost 
completely he said in a statement from washington dc i am 
hopeful that chevron can find a buyer so that the mine can resume 
operations 
sen pete domenici rnm said in a telephone interview from 
santa fe that there were talks with the japanese about possible 
purchase of the mine and more us uranium but their interest 
appeared to be minimum 
in october 1988 new mexicos ailing uranium industry received a 
boost when four japanese utility companies agreed to buy 3 million 
pounds of uranium from the mount taylor mine 
the mine near san mateo on the western slope of mount taylor in 
cibola county has 35 percent to 45 percent of the recoverable 
uranium reserves in the united states domenici said 
if the mine were flooded then it is at least highly possible 
that it would be lost forever and that is more than a trivial 
incident in the uranium situation in the united states he said 
the us department of energy at the direction of the white 
house is trying to evaluate the impact of the mines closure on 
the national interest domenici said 
we have asked the federal government to think of any and all 
ways and means of logically preserving this asset and thats what 
theyre looking at he said many of us believe we should not 
become totally dependent on foreign countries

general motors corp will stop 
assembling the oldsmobile custom cruiser wagon at its arlington 
plant once the redesigned chevrolet caprice goes on line there in 
june officials said 
the lowvolume wagon is one of three car models now being

to its willow run mich plant where the automaker is 
consolidating production of station wagons for the chevrolet buick 
and pontiac lines

caprice and brougham production but also could clear the way for 
building the new buick roadmaster in arlington in 1991 as a 
1992model car the fort worth startelegram reported 
the roadmaster and a new cadillac model are scheduled for 
production as derivatives of the caprices gm300 platform the new

a federal judge has allowed chevron corp 
to sue pennzoil co for allegedly concealing a takeover attempt 
but he refused to let chevron use the case to validate its 
antitakeover maneuvers 
us distrcit judge thelton henderson said chevron despite a 
unquestionably weak factual support could try to prove 
its claim that pennzoil was plotting a takeover or a forced 
restructuring when it secretly bought 88 percent of chevrons 
common stock 
henderson in the ruling friday dismissed the rest of chevrons 
suit including the oil companys request for an order that its 
management acted legally in changing company bylaws to make hostile 
takeovers more difficult 
the judge said pennzoil was not challenging that action and 
also noted that several other suits against chevron management had 
been filed by other groups of stockholders in delaware state courts 
the rulings narrowed the scope of the suit san franciscobased 
chevron filed dec 7 after pennzoil disclosed it had bought 21 
billion worth of chevron stock

the vice president of the european 
economic communitys governing commission said sunday that the eec 
is examining the possibility of trade and economic cooperation 
agreements with romania 
frans andriessen announced the eec position at a news conference 
after a day of meetings with the provisional romanian leadership 
and representatives of five opposition parties 
romanian foreign minister sergiu celac told the news conference 
that his countrys economy is in almost complete ruin and needs 
massive imports of food to feed its 23 million people 
andriessen who is dutch said he discussed shortterm aid with 
interim president ion iliescu prime minister petre roman celac 
and other officials but he added there was not time on the oneday 
visit to talk about longerterm projects 
we are ready to review negotiations on a trade agreement and 
an agreement of economic cooperation andriessen said 
he said technical experts who accompanied him would stay on to 
study shortterm aid needs a statement distributed at the news 
conference said that as soon as possible a meeting would be 
arranged on a trade and economic agreement 
the eec cancelled a 1980 trade agreement with romania last year 
because of human rights abuses during the regime of dictator 
nicolae ceausescu who was overthrown and executed in late december 
asked if a revived agreement would have to be put off until 
after elections for a permanent government andriessen said no 
substantial package could probably be worked out until after 
such a vote but he added he was not listing an election as a 
condition for aid 
andriessen said the only conditions were the state of play of 
democracy in romania and certain economic and monetary conditions 
in line with eec philosophy 
celac was asked why romania needed an infusion of aid when 
ceausescus stringent economic policies succeeded in paying off a 
foreign debt of more than 10 billion between 1982 and last year 
the repayment of the huge foreign debt was made at a cost of 
great suffering to the people and the almost complete ruin of the 
economy he replied we are none the better for having paid the 
foreign debt we have a lot to rebuild 
we are now impelled to import food massively he said 
adding it was needed both to feed the population and to save 
livestock 
andriessen was asked if there was a time frame for romania 
joining the eec he responded that the eec was not accepting new 
members at this point

black leaders and health organizations plan 
to protest the rj reynolds tobacco cos launch here of a new 
menthol cigarette targeted at blacks the company says its a 
victim of discrimination 
reynolds plans to introduce uptown cigarettes in philadelphia on 
feb 5 as a test before marketing the brand nationally 
theyre taking their own brand of death and trying to market 
it to the black community said pastor jesse brown of the christ 
evangelical lutheran church and president of the committee to 
prevent cancer among blacks 
but reynolds spokeswoman maura payne said the company was merely 
trying to compete with other existing brands 
there seems to be a bit of bigotry here payne said 
people are arguing that black consumers dont have a right to buy 
a product for which they have expressed a desire we believe black 
smokers have a right to choose between newport salem kools and 
uptown 
representatives from 30 groups including the american cancer 
society local black religious groups and the city health 
department met thursday and will meet again soon to plan protest 
strategies said robert robinson president of the national black 
leadership initiative on cancer in philadelphia 
im very opposed to the idea of a cigarette being developed 
and targeted to the africanamerican community robinson said 
the africanamerican community is already suffering the highest 
rate of cancer in the country 
uptown is being marketed partly because reynolds other menthol 
cigarette salem has declined in popularity ms payne said 
about 62 percent of all black smokers prefer menthol cigarettes 
she said but studies showed salem had too much menthol for many 
black smokers 
reynolds chose philadelphia as a test market because of its 
sizable black population ms payne said 
according to the us office of smoking and health 34 percent 
of blacks and 29 percent of whites smoked cigarettes in 1985 the 
latest figures available

officials of united airlines pilots union say 
theyll try to come up with a new buyout proposal for parent ual 
corp by the middle of next week to prevent a costly 
recapitalization by the board 
the unions governing council will meet jan 24 to determine 
if we can develop a viable proposal for employee ownership to 
submit to the board the next day three top officials of the 
united branch of the air line pilots association said in a letter 
to the 7000 members saturday 
last week the board of suburban elk grove villagebased ual 
said its advisers would try to submit a recapitalization plan by 
jan 25 because no leveraged buyout proposal from employees was in 
sight 
such a recapitalization intended to boost the companys stock 
price would be likely to reduce uals equity and increase its debt 
the pilots and ual chairman stephen wolf led a 300ashare or 
68 billion buyout attempt for the carriers parent last year 
the offer collapsed when they failed to obtain financing though 
and talks to come up with a revised plan have gone slowly 
the letter to union members said traditional labor tactics even 
calling for a strike are of questionable and limited value in 
blocking a recapitalization it was signed by union chairman 
frederick dubinsky vice chairman stephen smith and treasurer felix 
isherwood 
they said the only course was to submit a proposal for employee 
ownership at the jan 25 board meeting

a fourth theme park a soviet 
pavilion and seven new hotels will be among major projects to be 
built during a decade of rapid expansion at floridas disney world 
disney chairman michael eisner announced 
the 1990s also will feature the entertainment conglomerates 
venture into timeshare vacation units and it plans to open 29 new 
attractions at its three existing florida parks the magic kingdom 
epcot center and disneymgm studios 
walt disney co already has plans to open euro disneyland near 
paris and to build studio attractions at its japanese and 
california parks during the next few years among other additions 
eisner said on friday disney said it is studying the possibility 
of opening another southern califoria theme park 
but this is the place where the disney decade will have the 
most impact he said sunday 
eisner would not put a price tag on any of the new projects but 
said each must give the walt disney co the required return on 
investment 
the companys objectives are to grow about 20 percent a year 
and have a return on equity of 20 percent for the next decade 
so we can stay healthy 
disney expects total attendance at all its parks to approach 100 
million visits a year by the end of the century said company 
president frank wells though disney does not provide annual 
attendance figures published reports have said that disney 
attractions worldwide drew about 30 million people last year 
eisner disneys chairman and chief executive officer said at a 
news conference at the newly opened 758room swan hotel that the 
company anticipates a strong national economy over the decade but 
that some of disneys plans could be modified if there is a drastic 
downturn 
otherwise he said everything we have announced will 
definitely be built 
disney officials would not disclose any details about the fourth 
florida park or say when construction would begin 
negotiations with soviet officials have been taking place for 
years and an agreement on a soviet pavilion at epcot center is 
near eisner said also to be announced soon he said are plans 
for a swiss pavilion featuring a matterhorn ride 
most of the focus at the start of the decade will be on new 
hotels and expansion of the newest central florida park disneymgm 
studios because its overwhelming success caught us off guard 
sixteen new shows will result in doubling the capacity of the 
studios exhibits in the next five years eisner said 
these include the newly opened star tours thrill ride several 
shows featuring the muppets a dick tracy musical revenue based on 
a dick tracy movie and the revival of the television game show 
lets make a deal 
seven new or completely transformed attractions will be 
introduced at the magic kingdom and five at epcot center he said 
the 375 million swan formally opened saturday is the first of 
the hotels being built with entertainment as the main architectural 
theme they will have 5500 guest rooms in total and are in 
addition to two others under construction 
eisner said walt disney world did not intend to be completely 
selfcontained in guest accommodations and activities but 
were not meeting the demand of those who want to stay onsite 
he said 
the swan is part of a convention center complex with a 
1509room hotel called the dolphin that is scheduled to open july 
4 
miami dolphins quarterback dan marino assisted sunday in 
ceremonies at which the first of two 30ton dolphin statues was 
hoisted to the roof of the partially completed hotel 
among its other expansion plans disney says it will build 500 
timeshare units near its theme parks replying to a question about 
the bad reputation many of these developments have acquired eisner 
said the company believed we can do it in an attractive honest 
way 
a longdiscussed commercial shopping mall is still planned on 
property disney owns in neighboring osceola county and eisner said 
details of the project are to be announced within 60 days 
disney owns 27400 acres straddling orange and osceola counties 
a 30acre disney boardwalk in the tradition of the atlantic 
city and coney island amusement areas is scheduled to open late 
next year 
there was speculation in the past week that disney also planned 
a zoo or liveanimal attraction but eisner said there were no such 
projects in the works
