with two texans on the national ticket voter turnout in the lone 
star state is expected to be high but elsewhere political parties 
and other groups are scrambling to get a reluctant electorate out on 
election day 
i dont see nearly as much enthusiasm as you typically see in a 
presidential year said chris verenes executive director of the 
south carolina democratic party in a comment echoed across the 
country 
with only half of the countrys eligible voters expected to turn 
out tuesday down from the 1984 figure of 53 percent republicans 
and democrats alike know that getting people to vote will be their 
no 1 challenge 
the white house 33 senate seats and all 435 seats in the house 
are at stake and state and local races and issues abound 
parties unions and other specialinterest groups are running 
phone banks to reach swing voters as well as the faithful as usual 
workers will hand out leaflets arrange for babysitting and escort 
people to the polls but there are also some more unusual strategies 
in arkansas where the deerhunting season opened saturday 
republicans mounted a mail campaign encouraging deer hunters to get 
an absentee ballot if they wont be back from hunting in time for 
the election the national rifle association has saturated arkansas 
and a dozen other states with ads claiming michael dukakis would 
disarm sportsmen a charge the democratic presidential candidate 
denies 
coalition 88 a group of gays and others who want two california 
aids initiatives defeated will have hundreds of volunteers on 
election day erecting human billboards at 70 major intersections 
in los angeles urging voters to get out and turn down the two 
propositions 
both parties are conducting massive drives for the states 135 
million registered voters but worry about the dampening effect of a 
ballot with nine state initiatives and possibly hundreds of local 
measures says state gop chairman bob naylor im very concerned 
that people will be confronted with long lines at the polls get 
early results from the east coast and absentee ballots and say 
what the heck i wont vote 
reasons for the low turnout projections vary but many pundits 
point to laws requiring registration days or weeks before the 
election many voters also may simply be uninterested in the races 
and find no compelling issue or inspiring candidate 
in alabama where there is no race for governor us senate or a 
major statehouse post officials expect many voters to stay home 
oklahoma officials blame the tenor of the presidential race 
there is more negative campaigning than there was four years 
ago and i think it might affect the turnout says lance ward 
secretary of the oklahoma election board 
but in texas home state of democratic vice presidential nominee 
lloyd bentsen and republican presidential nominee george bush the 
chief election officer is predicting a record turnout registration 
is up 345500 from the previous high in 1984 and there is a larger 
than normal number of statewide races on the ballot to boot 
if we cant get them excited about this election i dont know 
what its going to take said jack rains the secretary of state 
who conducted the voter registration campaign 
in utah three taxlimitation initiatives are seen as the biggest 
hope of getting voters to the polls and a maryland guncontrol 
referendum thats the subject of an expensive nra campaign could 
increase voter turnout there by as much as 3 percent officials 
suggest 
although the role of getting out the vote traditionally belongs 
to the parties unions and other specialinterest groups are doing 
their part 
in arizona opponents of a proposed amendment to the state 
constitution to make english arizonas official language are 
conducting a major getoutthevote campaign focused primarily on 
hispanic neighborhoods 
we will make 175000 calls to spanishspeaking voters and 
distribute about 300000 pieces of literature said rick degraw a 
political consultant coordinating the effort there are 27 
different organizations some of them very small working on this 
statewide 
the aflcio will have 500000 volunteers out on election day a 
majority of them in states with the most union members which also 
happen to be states with big electoral votes the union has a 
computer information bank that lets volunteers know how to reach 13 
million members 
in new mexico the aflcio is dispatching buses to meet carlsbad 
potash miners getting off work and take them directly to the polls 
in west virginia the united mine workers union is conducting its 
own telephone campaign and will have volunteers at key precincts 
but even union officials say they are not sure they can get their 
members to turn out in heavy numbers chris scott the aflcio 
president in north carolina predicted a significant dropoff from 
the 1984 election and summed up the reason for some frustrated 
voters 
i dont believe theres a candidate running for office in this 
state whos given people a positive reason to go out of their way to 
vote

americas wealthiest families are keeping ahead 
of inflation the poorest are losing ground and many of the rest 
are holding even only because more family members are working 
according to a new economic study 
the study conducted for the economic policy institute shows a 
widening gap between rich and poor since president reagan took 
office with the topearning 20 percent making nine times as much 
money in 1986 as the poorest 20 percent compared with seven times 
as much in 1979 
institute president jeff faux said the report shows average 
american families have been under greater economic pressure during 
the past decade than at any time since world war ii 
without new economic policies it is clear that families can no 
longer count on steadily increasing incomes and that the next 
generations cannot expect to live better than their parents faux 
said 
stephen rose a seattle economist who wrote the report along with 
economist david fasenfest of louisville said the widening gap 
between rich and poor is a reversal of trends in earlier decades 
the study concludes that without big increases in the number of 
women working as many as 60 percent of american families those 
earning less than 40000 a year in 1986 would have been unable to 
keep up with inflation between 1979 and 1986 the latest year for 
which complete data is available 
the report says the number of working wives increased from 554 
percent in 1979 to 661 percent in 1986 
this is an important first step in measuring the real economic 
benefit of having a wife work rose said in a telephone interview 
sunday but he cautioned that more study is needed to determine the 
additional costs families incur when the wife works such as greater 
need for child care 
the institute formed in 1986 is a nonpartisan nonprofit 
organization which has often been critical of reagans conservative 
economic policies 
it said that with more women in the work force average adjusted 
family income increased 73 percent from 38492 in 1979 to 41288 
in 1986 the study multiplies 1979 earnings by 1609 to adjust for 
inflation 
but it showed that income for the lower twofifths of the nation 
or those earning under 27000 is slipping behind inflation 
rose said the study used a standard economic practice of dividing 
the country into fifths by income 
the top group includes families that earned over 59533 in 1986 
their income averaged 94104 compared with 9133 for families in 
the lowest fifth 
the report said salaries for most working wives have increased 
faster than inflation while salaries for all but the richest 
american men havent kept up wives earnings adjusted for 
inflation increased 121 percent from an average 14064 in 1979 to 
15768 in 1986 the study said while husbands adjusted earnings 
dropped from 23204 to 22240 
it also said young adults who do not finish college are doing 
substantially worse than those who were the same age a decade 
ago 
low wages are forcing growing numbers of unattached young people 
15 million more than a decade ago to return to the nest of 
their parents households rather than living on their own it said

portauprince haiti ap col jeanclaude paul the forcibly 
retired commander of haitis most feared army unit who was indicted 
on us drug charges died sunday under suspicious circumstances a 
family friend said he was 49 
radio haitiinter said paul a 29year army veteran and one of 
haitis most powerful figures died of a heart attack at about 3 
pm in his home in suburban fermathe the independent station gave 
no other details 
a family friend said there was speculation paul was poisoned 
possibly prior to having a heart attack 
the friend who would not be identified further said pauls 
housemaid and yardman were arrested and taken to petionville police 
station for questioning about the colonels death 
pauls former wife mireille delinois was taken to the station 
sunday night and was under police protection because of fear of 
reprisals by pauls relatives the friend said 
the military governments spokesman frantz lubin said he had no 
information on pauls death us embassy spokeswoman susan clyde 
also said she had nothing the capital portauprince appeared 
calm 
paul was fired sept 30 after a coup led by noncommissioned 
officers ousted haitis military leader lt gen henri namphy 
replacing him with lt gen prosper avril 
the coup leaders said they were outraged with the statesponsored 
murder and corruption namphy tolerated 
paul had commanded the 700man dessalines battalion the most 
brutal unit in haitis 7000member army and had been linked to the 
tonton macoutes the hated private army of the 29year duvalier 
family dictatorship 
soldiers under pauls command have been blamed for widespread 
violence that has thwarted moves toward democratization promised 
after a popular uprising drove jeanclaude duvalier into exile in 
february 1986 
the violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the 
cancellation of independently run general elections last november 
leaving at least 34 people dead 
paul had been considered one of the most powerful members of the 
army which has run this impoverished caribbean nation for most of 
its 144 years 
in march he was indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on 
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the united states 
soldiers who staged the sept 17 rebellion that ousted namphy 
said they wanted to name paul the army chief but decided not to 
because of the drug charges 
immediately after the coup paul appeared to be allied with 
avril but the new leader reportedly became concerned that paul 
might turn against him avril had already ousted about 60 of the 
armys most repressive commanders 
haitian and diplomatic sources later said pauls retirement could 
help lead to the renewal of a 70 million annual aid package the 
united states cut off after the november 1987 election massacre one 
of the conditions the reagan administration has set for renewing aid 
is that haiti cooperate in halting the flow of drugs through haiti 
into the united states 
the drug trafficking indictment alleges paul conspired to import 
220 pounds of cocaine into the united states in december 1986 it 
says the traffickers used a landing strip on pauls farm 90 miles 
outside portauprince to load and fly the shipment to the bahamas 
fritz pierrelouis a former lieutenant in the haitian army who 
later defected told sens alfonse damato rny and bob graham 
dfla in a special us senate hearing that 70 percent of pauls 
troops were involved in drug trafficking 
namphy led a military junta that assumed power when jeanclaude 
duvalier fled into exile in france 
an attempt to dismiss paul in june failed and led to the fall of 
the civilian government of leslie f manigat who won militaryrun 
presidential elections in january 
namphy had reassigned paul to an administrative post but paul 
refused and was backed by manigat namphy ousted manigat on june 20 
accusing him of meddling in army affairs and paul remained head of 
his battalion 
paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew namphy in 
september 
the soldiers who formed haitis new government have said they 
want to end random statesponsored violence and institute 
democratic reforms but the government has set no dates for 
elections

gunmen who staged a failed coup in the 
maldives and were holding 25 hostages aboard a crippled boat 
surrended on the high seas to indian navy ships sunday united news 
of india reported 
the agency quoting an official statement issued in new delhi said 
the foreign mercenaries surrended at 930 am 11 pm est in the 
indian ocean between the maldivian capital male and sri lanka uni 
said 
there was no immediate independent confirmation of the uni report 
two indian warships had been tailing the boat and military 
officers negotiated by radio with the gunmen for release of the 
hostages indian and maldivian officials in male said saturday 
among the captives was a maldivian cabinet minister officials 
said 
the british broadcasting corp reported saturday night that the 
captain of the crippled vessel said the mercenaries fatally shot two 
hostages wired the ship with explosives and threatened to blow it 
up if attacked 
the report said a bbc correspondent had spoken to the captain in 
a shiptoshore call 
maj zahir of the maldivian security forces said he could not 
verify the report he was contacted by telephone in male by the 
associated press and said the captains statement may have been 
propaganda 
the bbc report identified the ship as the progress light lloyds 
register of ships lists the progress light as a 5180ton freighter 
owned by maldives national ship management ltd in male 
maldivian president maumoon abdul gayoom said in a telephone 
interview broadcast by the bbc in london that the safety of the 
hostages was the paramount concern 
gayoom said saturday from male we wouldnt want to do anything 
that would engander their lives 
officials said an aide to former president ibrahim nasir 
participated in thursdays predawn attack and may have instigated 
it nasir who lives in singapore denied involvement 
in male members of the security forces patrolled the gray sand 
streets on saturday businesses and shops were closed because of a 
national day of mourning for those who died in the violence 
bloodstains were visible near the bulletscarred presidential 
palace and security force headquarters 
indias top diplomat in male said 27 to 32 people were killed 
when 150 gunmen believed to be tamil mercenaries from nearby sri 
lanka attempted to overthrow president gayoom 
this figure is probably understated because the mercenaries 
may have removed their dead ambassador ak banerjee said he 
provided no breakdown on the deaths but said 25 people were taken 
hostage aboard the vessel earlier reports had said there were 18 to 
20 hostages 
the mercenaries fled early friday after indian paratroopers 
landed to help gayoom and his lightly armed security forces in the 
indian ocean nation which is also known as the maldive islands 
banerjee and foreign minister fathulla jameel said they suspected 
the coup was instigated by abdullah luthufi a former nasir aide 
he was brandishing a gun as if he was the leader jameel said 
when contacted by telephone from colombo sri lanka 
he gave orders to different groups of people and for a short 
time this character went into the presidents office and to satisfy 
himself he sat on the presidents desk just to assert he had taken 
over the country 
banerjee said luthufi and two maldivian businessmen accompanied 
the gunmen he said said none of the three was caught and may be on 
the boat with the gunmen 
he said the cargo ship hit by fire from indian troops friday 
was limping northeast at 9 mph toward sri lanka with the indian 
warships staying close at hand 
he said the hostages included transport minister ahmed mujithaba 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said nasir 
supporters have been trying for up to five years to recruit 
guerrillas from sri lankas tamil ethnic minority tamil militants 
have been waging a separatist war against the sri lankan government 
since 1983 
the diplomats said nasirs supporters were thought to be behind 
coup attempts in 1980 and 1983 
gayoom 50 was first elected president in 1978 after nasir 
resigned 
indian paratroopers captured four gunmen friday banerjee said 
said other gunmen escaped in two boats including the one with the 
hostages 
indian paratroopers were conducting an islandbyisland search 
for the other boat banerjee said 
banerjee said some indian troops withdrew from maldives and 
reporters saw no indian soldiers in male on saturday

a scientist is studying the effects of last 
summers fire in yellowstone national park by analyzing urinesoaked 
snow to determine whether animals are getting enough to eat 
biologist glenn delgiudice perfected the testing which experts 
think has great promise for aiding wildlife studies around the world 
glenns technique is generating a great deal of excitement 
among researchers said l david mech a us fish and wildlife 
service scientist who is an internationally known wolf expert it 
can be applied anywhere animals live in snow for part of the year 
mech and ulysses s seal a biochemist widely recognized for his 
research on endangered wildlife initiated the technique of using 
snowurine samples in wildlife research but several years ago they 
turned over perfection of the technique to delgiudice then a 
graduate student at the university of minnesota 
for the past two years delgiudice has studied yellowstones elk 
and bison under an agreement between the veterans administration 
for whom he works and the national park service which manages the 
22 millionacre park in wyoming 
delgiudices work will allow scientists to compare the health of 
the bison and elk before and after the summer fires which affected 
500000 to 880000 acres in yellowstone there are no findings yet 
from the study 
about 20000 elk and 2600 bison spend the winter in yellowstone 
the park service estimates that four bison and 250 elk died in the 
fires which simply forced most big mammals into different parts of 
the park to find forage 
delgiudice was among about 25 scientists who recently met at 
yellowstone to prepare a plan for studying the effects of the fires 
he stressed that while the fires charred extensive timber and 
brush the burnedover areas form a mosaic pattern rather than a 
contiguous tract 
thats important delgiudice said because while vegetation has 
not yet returned to areas burned in late summer young plants 
already have emerged in tracts that were charred earlier those 
plants should help bison and elk survive this winter

there is an unusual unanimity this year about 
prospects for the senate in tuesdays balloting democrats will 
remain in control and may well increase their eightseat advantage 
the democrats will hold onto 54 seats at a minimum and i 
believe have a very good opportunity to add said sen john kerry 
of massachusetts chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee 
we realize its still quite volatile out there said tom 
mason spokesman for the national republican senatorial committee 
we could end up on election day minus two but we could just as 
easily be plus two or better 
one reason little change is expected is that unlike some past 
presidential elections there has been no overriding national theme 
dictated by the top of the ticket the kind of compelling issue that 
would propel voters to seek massive changes 
rather polls have show a general contentment with the status 
quo and that works to the benefit of incumbents 
that advantage extends to the house where very little movement 
is expected in the democrats 255177 majority 
there isnt the thematic difference that has pervaded 
presidential contests in the past mason said president reagan 
said it best we are the change its not as clear a mandate as in 
1980 when there was such a screaming need for change 
that was the year republicans rode reagans coattails to a 
12seat pickup and control of the senate for the first time in a 
quartercentury in 1986 an eightseat gain enabled democrats to 
retake control 
this time republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis 
have been criticized for running a race devoid of issues devoted 
mostly to personal attacks and distortions of each others records 
so issues in this years senate campaign have been largely drawn 
from a list of topics that democrats claim as their own although 
they have been used by candidates of both parties the environment 
education social security health care and family issues like 
child care 
also prominent in senate stump speeches and advertising have been 
the problems of drugs and crime which register near the top of 
americans concerns in national polls 
most senate incumbents of both parties appeared likely to win 
reelection on tuesday but there were several prominent exceptions 
analysts said republican sen david karnes who was appointed in 
1987 to fill an unexpired nebraska senate term was the most likely 
to be ousted democratic former gov bob kerrey a popular figure 
with a hollywoodlike appeal in the state held a heavy lead in 
polls 
three other incumbents two republicans and one democrat also 
faced difficult battles for survival 
in nevada gop sen chic hecht who for months had been 
considered the most vulnerable republican incumbent has fought back 
to a dead heat with his challenger democratic gov richard bryan a 
political action committee of import car dealers was pouring 
382000 into mass mailings and tv spots for hecht and hecht was 
running ads linking himself to bush and bryan to dukakis 
sen lowell weicker the veteran maverick republican from 
connecticut has resorted to his own negative ads attacking 
challenger joseph lieberman the states democratic attorney 
general the race is the most complex political matchup in the 
country lieberman has sought to outflank weicker by portraying him 
as aloof from connecticut concerns and has attracted support from 
all parts of the political spectrum 
republicans hungry for an upset were pointing to montana where 
they claimed to have democratic incumbent john melcher on the run 
his gop rival yellowstone county commissioner conrad burns was 
running positive biographical ads in the closing days of the 
campaign while melcher was airing maninthestreet testimonials 
advising against sending a greenhorn to washington 
six open seats where no incumbent was seeking reelection were 
the other major battleground democratic former virginia gov 
charles robb appeared poised to claim a formerly republican seat 
and rep james jeffords rvt was likely to enter the senate from 
his state rep trent lott rmiss also seemed to be holding 
firmly to a polling lead in his bid to replace retiring democratic 
sen john stennis 
but in three other open seats the outcome was up for grabs 
former sen slade gorton a republican picked up a spate of 
lastminute newspaper endorsements in his bid to keep washingtons 
senate seat in gop hands but polls showed democratic rival rep 
mike lowry in a dead heat 
florida promised a similar cliffhanger with democratic rep 
buddy mackay seeking to beat out republican rep connie mack in a 
state where bush held a heavy advantage like hecht mack was 
receiving substantial lastminute backing from the import car 
dealers pac 
in wisconsin democrat herb kohl a millionaire who owns the 
milwaukee bucks basketball team was holding onto a narrowing lead 
in his effort to retain the seat of retiring sen william proxmire 
for the democrats republican state senate minority leader susan 
engeleiter was pressing hard and both bush and reagan campaigned 
for her in the state

george bush relishes talking about how he and 
president reagan solved the malaise of the jimmy carter years 
when inflation was in double digits and the prime interest rate 
soared past 20 percent 
now with low inflation and low interest rates housing is 
again within reach of americas families boasts bush the 
republican presidential nominee sound republican policies have 
helped more families than ever to realize the dream of home 
ownership 
interest rates did come down but housing prices rose rapidly and 
a smaller percentage of americans live in their own homes today than 
when the reagan administration started 637 percent compared with 
656 percent in 1980 
tenants in many cities are confronted with soaring rents and a 
dwindling supply of apartments homelessness has become a major 
social ill with estimates of the number of people living on the 
streets or in shelters ranging from 250000 to 3 million 
it adds up to a crisis in housing for millions of americans that 
poses a major challenge for the next president 
the vice presidents democratic rival michael dukakis has 
sought to make housing one of the major campaign issues to support 
his claim that im on your side 
despite his upbeat talk bush has acknowledged the problems and 
offered the outlines of the strategy he would employ to solve them 
bush has promised that one of his chief goals will be to see 
that all american families are able to obtain decent affordable 
housing to do this we will maintain the policies that have 
brought us low inflation low interest rates and strong job 
creation which have given many americans the income to buy homes 
dukakis wants to allow firsttime home buyers to withdraw up to 
10000 in taxfree savings from their individual retirement 
accounts or 401k accounts to apply toward their downpayments 
dukakis went to levittown ny the postworld war ii model 
community to unveil his plan called home start saving toward an 
affordable residence today it would cost the treasury 400 million 
in lost revenues 
both candidates propose relaxing federal housing administration 
loan rules for firsttime buyers 
bush says he will ask the fha to experiment with reduced 
downpayments possibly as low as 1000 he also wants the fha to 
allow higher loan limits in expensive housing areas 
dukakis home start would allow people to get fha mortagages with 
only 3 percent down the agency now requires 3 percent down for the 
first 25000 and 5 percent for the remainder of the purchase price 
dukakis also would remove the current ceiling on fha loan 
guarantees of 67000 nationally and up to 101250 in high cost 
areas and would expand fha financing of adjustable rate mortgages 
bush criticized by sen bob dole of kansas during the gop 
primaries for saying most of the homeless were mentally ill now 
acknowledges that too many are families with children he 
promises to form publicprivate partnerships to build more 
singleroom occupancy shelters and he backs the 280 million 
mckinney act to aid the homeless 
bush is an enthusiastic supporter of housing vouchers for the 
poor and allowing tenants to take over ownership of public housing 
both bush and dukakis support the home mortgage interest 
deduction 
bush notes that the united states built its 100 millionth home 
last year and that housing starts were 25 percent higher in 1987 
than in 1980 builders have constructed 10 million homes in the past 
six years 
but with the median price of new homes up to 112400 in the 
second quarter of 1988 many young families find it increasingly 
difficult to climb onto the first rung of the housing ladder 
since this administration took office the price of houses has 
raced ahead of peoples wages and has made it impossible for many 
people to buy the homes they grew up in dukakis charged 
reagan cut deeply into the budget for the department of housing 
and urban development which has fallen from 34 billion to 15 
billion 
the government which used to help build or rehabilitate 200000 
units of housing for low and moderate income families each year now 
backs just 25000 
dukakis promises to launch a national partnership for affordable 
housing to spur construction of low and moderate income housing with 
federal grants and other support 
a report last march by the joint center for housing studies at 
harvard university warned america is increasingly becoming a 
nation of housing haves and havenots 
young households find purchasing a first home especially 
difficult unable to secure a home of their own these persons 
remain renters and bid up the price of rental housing the center 
said 
the problem of firsttime home buyers has gotten worse during 
the past eight years said stephen d driesler the national 
association of realtors senior vice president for government 
affairs for people who already owned homes the reagan years were 
very good 
according to the census bureau the homeownership rate among 
households in the 2429 age group fell from 433 percent in 1980 to 
359 percent in 1987 while the rate fell from 611 to 532 percent 
for those in the 3034 age group 
the national association of home builders says the 1986 overhaul 
of the nations tax code stripped away many incentives to build 
apartments builders are starting only 385000 multifamily units 
this year down from 669000 in 1985 
the rent burden has become particularly onerous for young 
singleparent families whose rents have increased from 349 percent 
of their incomes in 1974 to 584 percent in 1987 a report by the 
home builders says

long after theyve paid for their stereo 
or first car some mississippi teenagers could be making monthly 
payments they never anticipated child support 
faced with the highest percentage of teenage pregnancies in the 
nation the mississippi welfare department wants youths to know they 
can be held financially responsible for illegitimate offspring 
a new educational program which will include a video 
presentation and a brochure explains that if an unwed mother 
accepts welfare benefits she must help locate her childs father 
once a court has ordered child support payments the state can 
collect them to offset welfare costs if the mother refuses her 
portion of the familys welfare benefits will be cut 
the program geared for junior and senior high school students 
is being explained personally by state welfare commissioner thomas 
brittain to school boards around the state the schools can decide 
how to use the program 
it points out the states right to require men to submit to blood 
tests to legally establish paternity 
we owe it to the taxpayers to have the young men begin to take 
responsibility as well brittain said last week as he explained 
the program to school officials 
of all babies born in mississippi during 1987 20 percent or 
8302 were born to teenage mothers said jane lee director of 
reproductive health for the state health department 
too many of those children end up on welfare rolls brittain said 
we want to take a message out to young men as well as young 
women that theres a hard economic consequence to an unwed 
pregnancy he said 
that economic consequence is that if you participate in having 
someone become pregnant then youre going to pay that child support 
payment until that child is 21 years of age 
when we begin to diagram that out for students and show them 
what that means theyll say back to us things like gee ive got 
this parttime job and i need the money for paying for my stereo or 
i need the money for gasoline and we basically will be saying 
tough luck that money first has to go for childsupport 
payments brittain said 
the welfare department has sought bids for the teenage 
parenthood video which should be ready for distribution to 
classrooms in january brittain said 
the program also has a dollarsandcents guide that extends into 
the students adult lives brittain said 
students will be given a chart listing how much they can expect 
to earn in several occupations ranging from a minimumwage job to 
corporate executive 
the chart also tells them how much they could expect to pay in 
child support for example if a student someday becomes a janitor 
and makes 700 per month then he can be required to pay 119 
monthly or 29988 covering his child through age 21 
brittain explained that the state can enforce child support 
collections by requiring an employer to withhold a portion of the 
parents pay check by intercepting state and federal tax refund 
checks and by putting liens on real estate and personal property 
information regarding pastdue child support will be distributed 
to credit reporting agencies for determining the parents credit 
rating brittain said 
yazoo county school board member arthur nichols said he thought 
the new educational program could prevent some teenage pregnancies 
i think it would wake me up pretty quick nichols said 
brittain said the educational program is similar to those offered 
by welfare departments in georgia and california 
he said the plan also was presented recently to the states 
judges association since the courts are responsible for setting 
child support payments 
chancery judge billy bridges of rankin county has volunteered to 
speak to students 
i enforce it just like i do in a divorce case the judge said 
of child support involving unwed parents i would assume that all 
judges take the same position that i do its the law

epidemic appears to be over in norwegian danish and swedish waters 
but that some cases of seal death are still registered by britain 
and the netherlands 
hedlund markussen was quoted by the national ntb news agency as 
saying autopsies and analyses carried out at the veterinary 
institute give no factual evidence that the illness symptoms causing 
the seal deaths have anything to do with pollution or distemper a 
contagious virus appears to cause the symptoms and subsequent 
infection of the respiratory passage with coughing and fever up to 
41 degrees celsius 102 f

central america is becoming one of the most 
inhospitable and risky areas for us diplomats and military 
personnel 
nagging concerns over personal security widespread antiamerican 
sentiment and the career risk of having to defend highly 
controversial us policies plague us officials assigned in the 
region particularly in panama el salvador and nicaragua 
as an example of the potential risk to career advancement sen 
christopher dodd dconn an outspoken critic of administration 
policy in the region recently blocked the promotion of two foreign 
service officers stationed there 
a countrybycountry rundown of the difficulties facing us 
personnel 
panama in october us marine sentries at howard air force 
base exchanged gunfire on four occasions with unidentified 
intruders between february and october there were 240 reported 
cases of harassment of american servicemen in panama according to 
the us southern command 
in september the administration decided to reduce the us 
diplomatic presence because of what one official called a 
potentially confrontational situation linked to continued 
uspanamanian hostility 
the administrations decision not to have dealings with panamas 
militarydominated government has produced a variety of problems for 
us diplomats some are forced to drive with expired licenses 
because the government wont renew them while others rent cars 
rather than risk driving with expired plates 
el salvador concern over personal security has heightened with 
stepped up leftist rebel activity in san salvador the capital in 
late october the offices of the us agency for international 
development were struck by a projectile that cracked several windows 
and caused minor damage 
in previous years the us embassy has been the target of rebel 
attacks on several occasions but without serious incident diplomats 
posted in el salvador long have been security conscious never 
taking the same route twice in a row when commuting to avoid 
detection one diplomat had his car repainted every few weeks 
nicaragua in july us ambassador richard melton and seven 
other members of the embassy staff were expelled by the sandinista 
government on grounds of interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs 
nicaragua has refused to allow the state department to send 
replacement envoys to managua placing an unusually heavy work load 
on the remaining skeleton staff their mission is complicated by an 
atmosphere of almost complete mistrust between the two governments 
several state department officials said the biggest concern of 
us diplomats posted in the region is not personal security but the 
possibility that their association with president reagans policies 
could damage their careers 
dodd recently blocked the promotions of everett briggs us 
ambassador to honduras and david dlouhy who is stationed in el 
salvador and spent a brief period as head of the embassy 
dodd complained that the two envoys impeded congressional 
attempts to exercise oversight of us policy his action 
underscored the continuing animosity between the administration and 
democratic liberals over central america 
dlouhy accused dodd of mccarthyite tactics that would send a 
chilling message to the foreign service 
said perry shankle president of the american foreign service 
association the union of career diplomats as a career officer 
you do put your career on the line in these highly charged 
situations there are a lot of dangers involved 
despite the risks there is no shortage of career diplomats 
willing to serve in central america state department officials say 
one reason is that service in that region is a quick route to 
inhouse promotions the officials say noting that 
congressional approval is required only for promotions involving the 
highest ranking officials 
still central america has been a careerthreatening area for 
some time when the reagan administration assumed office eight years 
ago numerous officials who had a hand in implementing president 
carters policy in central america were either fired or sent to 
lowpriority areas as punishment for perceived misjudgments 
the most dramatic example was carters last assistant secretary 
for latin america william bowdler who shortly before reagans 
first inaugural was summarily evicted from his office shattered by 
the experience he soon left the foreign service and has lived in 
virtual seclusion with his wife in southern virginia ever since

education secretary lauro cavazos is seeking 
the advice of thousands of lenders colleges and universities and 
public officials on how to hold down the escalating default rate on 
student loans 
the education department says taxpayers spent 15 billion to 
cover defaults on the guaranteed student loan program in the fiscal 
year that ended sept 30 almost 43 percent of the programs entire 
cost 
the figure represents a 200 percent increase over the past five 
years in what is now known as the stafford loan program the 
department said 
we want the advice of all parties the congress the public 
schools lenders guarantee agencies and borrowers cavazos said 
in a statement a lot has already been done but clearly 
additional action is necessary 
the program has loaned about 40 billion since it began of the 
current 12 billion in outstanding loans about 5 billion is 
overdue the department said 
charles kolb acting deputy undersecretary for planning budget 
and evaluation said cavazos has sent letters appealing for advice 
to more than 7000 participating colleges and universities 13000 
lenders 54 agencies that guarantee student loans 50 governors and 
members of congress 
cavazos who was president of texas tech university until taking 
over as education secretary in september is also accepting 
suggestions from students he is especially concerned about those 
who defaulted on their loans because they were unable to earn a 
living after attending unscrupulous trade or other schools that 
award a certificate but do not provide necessary job skills 
kolb said some schools have 100 percent default rates suggesting 
they may not be providing the kind of education necessary for 
students to hold a job and earn enough money to repay their loans 
there are a lot of scams going on here kolb said 
a school must be accredited to qualify students for guaranteed 
student loans but kolb said there are still fly by night 
operations that dont give students a technical background 
just a paper certificate no skills and a debt 
its getting just unbelievable schools are recruiting right 
out of welfare lines they get the students to get federally backed 
loans and the school gets the money and the kid gets the debt 
kolb said 
kolb said former education secretary william bennett had proposed 
that schools that fail to get their default rate below 20 percent 
could be cut from the program cavazos has extended the comment 
period on that proposal until the end of february 
kolb said of the 7300 schools participating in the program 30 
percent have default rates above 20 percent 
cavazos also wants to know to what extent lenders guarantee 
agencies and schools should share in the risk and cost of defaults 
how communication can be improved among those participating whether 
credit reports and cosigners should be required for borrowers with 
poor credit histories and how consumer and personal financial 
counseling can be used most effectively

as thieves and enemies who know absolutely nothing about 
south africa 
botha held the exchange with journalists during a hostile 
questionandanswer period that followed his speech at a saturday 
night dinner banquet put on by the foreign correspondents 
association 
among other issues questions touched on the closing of an 
antiapartheid newspaper and on detentions of antiapartheid 
activists 
i am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives 
descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work 
instead of all the beauty promise and goodwill botha said after 
an argumentative exchange with one journalist 
you dont understand africa you dont understand african 
aspirations you dont understand african history he said 
the 400 people attending included foreign and local journalists 
and their guests such as us ambassador edward perkins 
i accuse you of being superficial i accuse you of glibly 
gliding over the african realities of which you know nothing 
absolutely nothing botha told the audience 
after a prolonged exchange with one women he said i dont 
want to quarrel with beautiful ladies i do better things with 
them 
he wondered out loud whether one questioner had psychological 
problems 
will you just sit down and listen to a man who has traveled 
through africa botha told another persistent questioner 
blacks dont want a westminsterstyle democracy he said 
even if you could remove all the whites from south africa tomorrow 
what you put here will not work 
asked about last weeks government suspension of the 
antiapartheid weekly mail newspaper botha said he supported the 
move he described the newspaper as one of the most vicious he 
has seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to 
more violence in this country 
asked why members of an extreme rightwing white group are not 
detained as frequently as antiapartheid activists botha said 
dont be stupid its not a question of arresting a few people and 
thats the end of it 
there are whites in this country who can put together a more 
efficient violent organization than the anc african national 
congress guerrilla movement botha said 
the anc is the main group fighting south africas whiteled 
government and its system of apartheid under which the black 
majority has no voice in national affairs 
at the end of the hourlong impromptu debate the host offered to 
thank botha but the foreign minister refused to accept instead he 
returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by paul 
kruger a 19th century south african politician 
krugers opening words were friends citizens thieves and 
enemies and that is how i look at you this evening botha said 
the audience responded with boos hisses and shouts of go 
home botha left shortly afterward before dessert was served 
south africas media restrictions have been further tightened 
under the 29monthold state of emergency the emergency regulations 
prohibit reporting on security force actions most forms of protest 
and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive 
enforcement has not been comprehensive

israeli helicopter gunships rocketed the 
shop of a boat dealer suspected of links with plo guerrillas sunday 
demolishing the business and wounding five people two of them 
seriously police said 
the israeli army said its warplanes destroyed a palestinian 
guerrilla base in south lebanon it did not mention casualties 
lebanese police said four israeli cobra helicopter gunships 
blasted the shop and a nearby citrus grove with eight rockets in two 
sorties the shop in the southern port of sidon was closed at the 
time 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said the shop owner mahmoud hijazi was suspected of 
renting two motorboats to plo guerrillas and selling the guerrillas 
spare parts 
it was the sixth israeli air strike against guerrilla targets in 
south lebanon in three weeks and the 21st this year by police 
count 108 people were killed and 204 wounded in raids since jan 3 
hijazis motorboats anchored off the beach about 600 yards from 
his shop were not hit in the raid police said 
earlier police reports said aircraft attacked guerrilla bases in 
the teeming ein elhilweh refugee camp on sidons southern 
outskirts police said the guerrillas in the camp opened up with 
antiaircraft fire but were not targeted by the israeli aircraft 
israelibacked lebanese militiamen also killed three guerrillas 
who apparently landed in a boat on the meditteranean coast just 
north of israel the army command said 
an israeli army announcement said the base attacked sunday was 
used for launching attacks and ammunition storage it said all 
planes that took part in the raid returned safely 
the brief announcement gave no further details 
the attack followed mock raids by six israeli jets against the 
palestinian guerrilla strongholds at midmorning 
palestinian camps south of sidon have taken the brunt of the 
steppedup israeli raids which have by police count have killed 40 
people and wounded 91 in the past three weeks 
the blitz is in apparent retaliation for a suicide carbombing 
that killed eight israeli soldiers in south lebanon on oct 19 and a 
firebomb attack that killed an israeli mother and her three children 
in the israelioccupied west bank oct 30 
also sunday israelibacked south lebanon army militiamen killed 
three guerrillas in a firefight near naqoura about two miles north 
of the border with israel there were no sla casualties the 
military command said 
the army said the guerrillas apparently landed from a boat and 
were hiding in the area one of the guerrillas fired a 
rocketpropelled grenade at the patrol before being killed it said 
two other guerrillas were found shortly afterward and were killed 
in a firefight the army said it did not identify the group to 
which the guerrillas belonged 
the clash was in israels selfproclaimed security zone in south 
lebanon a six to 10mile zone carved out when israel withdrew the 
bulk of its occupation troops from lebanon in june 1985 
the zone is patrolled by about 2000 lebanese militiamen trained 
and financed by israel foreign reports say about 1000 israeli 
soldiers also are stationed in the zone 
in beirut the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god accused 
the amal militia of violating a syriansponsored nokidnapping pact 
the accord was signed friday by the two sides the countrys main 
shiite militias 
a hezbollah statement charged that amal militiamen had kidnapped 
four hezbollah militiamen in south beiruts chiyah district saturday 
night there was no comment from amal

solidarity leaders on sunday threatened 
broad protests including strikes if the government does not 
reverse its decision to close the lenin shipyard in gdansk 
the statement was the strongest yet by the banned trade union 
movement on the planned closing of the yard where solidarity began 
solidarity which in august helped end polands worst wave of 
strikes in seven years now appears to be on a collision course with 
the communist government 
the government announced oct 31 that it will close the yard in 
december because the business is losing money 
but solidaritys national executive commission led by lech 
walesa said in a statement there is no actual economic 
justification of this decision 
the gdansk shipyard has to be defended solidarity said in 
this situation we consider it necessary to conduct a broad action in 
november for the legalization of solidarity in defense of the 
gdansk shipyard and the repressed participants in strikes even 
resorting to strike action 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said the 
unions plans might be clearer after a workers rally scheduled 
tuesday in gdansk 
a walesa aide piotr konopka quoted walesa as telling worshipers 
at st brygidas church in gdansk that he would call the a national 
strike alert at the rally 
a strike alert would mean organizing strike committees and 
getting workers prepared to strike at any moment unless their 
demands are met said solidarity spokesman wojciech maziarski 
the solidarity statement said the decision to close the 
10000worker yard is a dangerous political act pointing out the 
fact that the government of prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski takes 
advantage of extraordinary powers to sustain stalinist methods of 
administering the economy 
it is an act of revenge against solidarity and the gdansk 
shipyard the statement said 
while acknowledging that economic reform which solidarity 
supports may force the closing of some enterprises the statement 
said the closings should not be arbitrary political decisions 
it said any closures should be preceded by a review of economic 
performance with workers and their representatives taking part 
what should be the first step is the publication of a list of 
threatened enterprises and calling upon the employees of these 
enterprises to undertake attempts at improving the situation it 
said 
walesa issued a statement saturday refusing to meet with interior 
minister czeslaw kiszczak to discuss plans for wideranging economic 
talks with authorities until the shipyard decision was suspended and 
the government rehired all workers fired for taking part in the 
august strikes 
walesa ended the last of the august walkouts after gen kiszczak 
promised that the talks could include the subject of solidaritys 
future 
but the government has since insisted that solidarity first drop 
two alleged extremists from its delegation to the talks 
that condition the decision to close the shipyard and the 
failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for the august strikes 
has convinced solidarity leaders that the government is no longer 
interested in talks 
solidarity was the soviet blocs only independent labor movement 
until it was crushed by security forces in 1981 and outlawed in 1982

a powerful earthquake sunday night shook a 
sparsely populated mountain region of southern china near the burma 
border and communications were cut with the stricken area 
officials in beijing said 
at about the same time a smaller quake was reported in northern 
thailand near the burmese border the quake caused minor damage to 
buildings and swayed highrise buildings hundreds of miles to the 
south in bangkok 
in the skylounge restaurant on the top floor of bangkoks 
43story baiyoke tower the citys tallest building hundreds of 
panicked patrons fled without paying their bills 
on saturday another strong quake measuring 7 on the richter 
scale jolted an uninhabited mountain range in northern tibet and 
qinghai province in far western china 
no casualties were reported in any of the earthquakes 
the temblor in southern china on sunday night was centered in 
yunnan provinces lancang county home to the lahu minority group 
and measured 76 on the richter scale in china the us geological 
survey measured it at 74 
chen yong deputy director of the state seismology bureau in 
beijing said there was probably some damage in sparsely populated 
lancang county but we have no reports he said telephone lines 
between villages in the county and kunming capital of yunnan were 
cut by the quake 
the temblor was felt in kunming a city of 15 million people 240 
miles to the northeast but caused no damage there he said 
the thailand quake measured 5 on the richter scale and was 
centered in northern chiang mai province near the burma border it 
shattered windows in some buildings in nearby chiang rai city 
authorities said 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph 
a quake measuring 7 is capable of causing widespread heavy 
damage in a populated area while one measuring 8 on the scale is 10 
times as strong and is capable of tremendous damage 
mild earthquakes occur frequently in both areas of china hit by 
the weekend quakes but the intensity of these was unusual 
seismological officials said

human howls fill the night in the woods 
of new england where hunters and naturalists are on the prowl for 
the coyote which is rapidly replacing man and dog as the chief 
predator of deer 
in recent years the rarely seen coyote has grown in such numbers 
that massachusetts has started a hunting season and maine hunters 
are worried there soon may be more coyotes than deer sheep farmers 
in maine say the animal is driving some out of business 
but conservationists say reports of coyote kills are exaggerated 
and that the animal is doing some good 
when you look at the vast majority of coyotes in the state 
they are providing a degree of balance and diversity in the wildlife 
community and in the ecosystem said paul lyons a wildlife 
biologist for massachusetts metropolitan district commission the 
more diverse the community the better it is for everybody 
lyons is one of the naturalists who howl at night in the huge 
quabbin reservoir in western massachusetts the naturalists hope the 
animal will howl back from the howls they say they can learn where 
the animals hunt and live 
one thing the naturalists have learned is the coyotes have driven 
domestic dogs from the reservoir the dogs had been a predator of 
the deer 
massachusetts has an estimated 1000 coyotes maine has at least 
16000 officials said 
the coyote is among the most intelligent of wild animals say 
those who track it related to the wolf the eastern coyote is the 
size of a small german shepherd with a foxlike head bushy tail and 
grayblack coat it averages four feet long from nose to tail tip 
and weighs about 40 pounds 
the western coyote migrated east in the 1930s breeding with the 
algonquin wolf along the way and evolving into a larger species 
since 1980 massachusetts officials have confirmed 28 coyote 
attacks on lambs and other small livestock all but three of the 75 
deer carcasses found last winter at the quabbin reservoir were 
killed by coyotes naturalists said 
massachusetts started coyote hunting in 1981 after a handful of 
farmers claimed coyotes had killed newborn calves since then 
hunters have killed 20 to 40 coyotes yearly in massachusetts 
officials said 
the massachusetts audubon society opposed coyote hunting saying 
there was insufficient evidence the animals seriously threatened 
ecological stability a coyote protection bill failed in the 
legislature in 1981 and the farmers prevailed 
richard turner southwestern wildlife district game manager for 
massachusetts said coyotes may even be a help since they eat 
animals killed by cars or other causes and keep such pests as 
rabbits and field mice under control 
maine hunters and sheep farmers however call them a menace 
unofficial estimates of the number of maine deer killed by coyotes 
range from 3000 to 15000 yearly officials have no estimates on 
sheep killed 
maine has never banned coyote hunting and officials said at 
least 1600 coyotes are killed by hunters and farmers annually 
one prohunting group the maine coyote control association has 
offered a 25 reward for each dead coyote during hunting season 
which runs most of the winter 
id poison them if i could said connie skov a maine sheep 
farmer who said has lost nearly a dozen sheep to coyotes they are 
just no good 
she said coyote attacks have helped drive eight small sheep farms 
out of business in waldoboro 80 miles north of portland 
but henry hilton animal damage control adminstrator for maine 
said there are ways to stop the sheep kills 
a lot of farmers will attest to the fact that if you use a 
minimum amount of sound husbandry its just not a problem he 
said 
hilton said coyotes dont have much of an impact on the deer 
herd since 1986 he said the herd has been increasing because of 
bans on hunting doe and other regulations 
coyote hunting continues simply because the animal is far from an 
endangered species he said if there is no reason to protect them 
from harvest that leaves them open to be harvested hilton said

a painting of vivid yellow and orange flowers 
in a dark vase hanging on a faded wall of a littleknown museum on 
the nile is an original work by vincent van gogh french experts 
say 
it is real absolutely real without doubt francoise cachin 
director of paris musee dorsay told a news conference saturday 
the onefootsquare canvas is among 350 paintings and other art 
works at the mohammed mahmoud khalil museum which houses the 
private collection of an egyptian senator donated to the state by 
his widow in 1960 
the painting attributed to van gogh titled poppies by the 
museum is being called flowers by the french experts until we 
can determine exactly what kind of flowers are in the vase said 
cachin 
in 1967 egyptian authorities estimated its value at 500000 
but cachin didnt give any estimate of how much it might be worth 
today 
a van gogh painting has commanded the single highest price ever 
paid for a painting his irises sold for almost 539 million 
in new york in november 1987 van goghs sunflowers was sold at 
christies in london in march 1987 for 3985 million 
the authenticity of the cairo painting has been questioned since 
it was stolen in 1978 from the domed arabesque building on an 
island on the nile opposite downtown cairo the painting was 
recovered at an undisclosed location in kuwait in 1980 
it is an authenic van gogh said the curator of the museums 
paintings genevieve lacambre 
lacambre who was curator of 19thcentury painting at the louvre 
in paris for 20 years studied the canvas attributed to the dutch 
master for three weeks before the results were announced 
cachin said the painting resembles a flower scene painted by the 
french artist adolphe monticelli whose work deeply affected the 
young van gogh the monticelli painting also is part of the khalil 
collection 
it is absolutely correct for the technique of early van gogh 
cachin said 
she said the back of the painting has a small numbered pink 
label the kind used by french art dealers 
it would be impossible to imagine someone could copy such a 
number said cachin who also studied a photograph from the paris 
dealer who sold the painting to khalil 
most of the canvases for which the dutchborn postimpressionist 
is remembered were painted in 29 months of frenzied activity before 
his suicide in 1890 at age 37 
the experts said they believed the cairo canvas was painted 
around 1887 
cachin said the painting is in a normal condition for a 
painting that has been stolen bernard malauzat french embassy 
cultural officer said the oil had small flakes of paint missing 
the painting has been in some small accident which seems to be 
recent maybe when it was traveling cachin said it can easily 
be restored 
the painting has been taken off display and put in storage at the 
nearby elgezira museum 
authorities have never fully revealed the details of the theft of 
the painting when it was recovered in march 1980 egypts 
theninterior minister nabawi ismail said three egyptians involved 
in the theft had been arrested and informed police where the canvas 
was left authorities never reported whether the thieves were 
charged or tried 
other works in he khalil collection all from the 19thcentury 
french school are by paul gauguin gustave courbet francois 
millet claude monet edouard manet auguste renoir and auguste 
rodin 
malauzat said 90 percent of the the museums 745 art works 
including 270 sculptures and more than 100 other works have been 
authenticated 
the majority of paintings are not in bad condition with proper 
expertise and cleaning they will be back to very bright colors 
malauzat said

a titan 34d rocket 
thundered into space sunday carrying a classified payload an expert 
said was probably a pair of military communications satellites 
the powerful 16storytall booster blasted off under heavy cloud 
cover from space launch complex 4 about 1003 am said capt john 
sullivan a spokesman at vandenberg about 140 miles northwest of 
los angeles 
as usual for military space flights the air force didnt 
announce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload to 
be put into orbit 
the titan 34d probably carried two satellite data system 
satellites said john pike a space policy expert for the 
washingtonbased federation of american scientists he said it also 
could have carried either a kh9 or kh11 photoreconnaissance spy 
satellite 
pike who knew of the launch in advance said friday the sds 
satellites are used for military communications especially in the 
event the united states had to launch a nuclear attack 
the titan 34d is americas most powerful space booster although 
it soon will be replaced by the titan 4 which is due for its maiden 
launch next year from cape canaveral fla 
sundays rocket was the last titan 34d that will be launched from 
vandenberg two more are scheduled for launch from cape canaveral 
early next year 
the last launch of a titan 34d was from florida on sept 2 but 
sources told the associated press it failed to orbit its payload 
because the rockets third stage failed to reignite 
titan 34ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive 
explosions during launches from vandenberg in 1985 and 1986

vote democratic this year she said and i wanted it to be known 
that i was going to vote democratic 
she said she knows democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis is the underdog but i have a weak spot for the underdog 
what you tend to be is gullible retorted her husband a 
staunch supporter of republican nominee george bush

on election night 1962 a young democratic 
candidate listened to returns on television in his hotel room while 
his 6yearold son sat on the floor drawing pictures 
now 26 years later the father plans to be at his sons side as 
they watch the returns tuesday that will determine if evan bayh will 
become the next governor of indiana and the first democrat to hold 
the office in 20 years 
bayh 32 would also be the youngest us governor in office 
today 
ill feel the same way whether he wins or loses said his 
father former threeterm us sen birch e bayh i love him im 
proud of him and i dont think anyone could have done it any 
better 
evan bayh indianas secretary of state held a 5440 lead over 
republican lt gov john m mutz in an indianapolis star poll 
published oct 30 the margin of error was 35 points gov robert 
d orr is barred from a third straight term 
the race in gop vice presidential candidate dan quayles home 
state is being watched for the coattail effect of both the 
bushquayle ticket and us sen richard g lugara reelection bid 
eleven other states select governors on tuesday delaware 
missouri montana new hampshire north carolina north dakota 
rhode island utah vermont west virginia and washington democrats 
are favored to retake the governors office in west virginia and 
utah 
the elder bayh who was unseated in the senate by quayle in 1980 
is legendary for his personal campaigning style and has been back on 
the hustings in recent weeks to help his son and other candidates 
across indiana 
bayhs activity and the famous name he gave his son birch evans 
bayh iii have prompted republicans to complain that the democratic 
candidate for governor has an unseemly advantage 
he inherited a good number of his fathers friends the elder 
bayh said but he also inherited his fathers enemies he said 
the famous name helped evan bayh get attention but after that 
hes done it all on his own 
its very much like the rookie on a baseball team where the all 
star leftfielder breaks his arm crashing into the wall and so the 
rookie gets to play said the elder bayh now 60 now those were 
circumstances over which he had no control he was lucky 
but if he cant hit and he cant catch and he cant throw hes 
not going to last 
the younger bayh in 197576 worked in his fathers brief campaign 
for the democratic presidential nomination as a law student evan 
bayh managed his fathers unsuccessful senate campaign against 
quayle 
birch bayh said his son expressed an interest in a career in 
public service in 1979 
i told him to make sure you know what you want to do putting 
your family first and think about financial security all the 
kinds of advice i didnt take when i was his age said bayh now a

public affairs and director of international programs at moorhead 
state university said friday 
haukebos book with an accompanying tape includes 37 stale 
tales that have been circulating in moorhead for years 
like the one about a hog farmer who bought 10 pigs for 20 each 
and sold the lot a year later for 20 asked if that was good 
business the farmer said of course i had their companionship 
for a whole year 
i might get run out of town for telling that story here said 
haukebo 60 but in china its very new

police shut down a business called the 
only nude car wash in the nation advising the owner that hiring 
naked women to scrub cars is against the law 
five women nude dancers turned car buffers and three male 
nightclub employees were cited when police put an end to the weekly 
event in a carport adjoining the fantasy world club assistant 
manager rodney bickel said sunday 
the manager a weightlifter whose stage name is the mad dog 
was also arrested on a felony charge of resisting arrest with 
violence bickel denied the charge against manager jim mercer 
saying police used brutal force against mercer in the saturday 
raid of the adultsonly club 
mercer was taken to university hospital for observation after 
complaining of shoulder injuries was returned to jail and posted 
bond sunday bickel said 
the clubs marquee boasts the car washs singular status 
we have girls that wash cars in the nude they are in an 
enclosed area we have a screened off drivethrough area that is 
part of the building dont think that they are visible bickel 
said theres blue tarp all the way around 
police wanted to close the 10per wash operation when it opened 
in midseptember but waited for word from the state attorneys 
office that the arrests were legal 
it should have been closed down the first week said vice 
detective bobby deal once they started the car wash the state 
attorney had to research whether it was a violation of the law 
the state attorneys office gave police the goahead on the 
premise that operating the car wash constituted a breach of the 
peace and violation of public nudity laws deal said 
needless to say there is not a statute that says jacksonville 
shall not have nude car washes said audrey moran deputy director 
of the state attorneys county court division but the case law on 
public nudity and breach of peace support it 
mrs moran said attorneys hadnt heard of any other nude car 
washes but they knew of a doughnut shop staffed by topless 
employees in fort lauderdale 
fantasy world owner warren colazzo started the car wash as part 
of his protest against a yearold city law banning topless dancing 
at businesses that sell alcohol 
the nude dancers were charged with breach of the peace and public 
nudity and the men were charged with breach of the peace and aiding 
in public nudity all are misdemeanors 
needless to say our car wash has been closed until this case 
is settled in court bickel said

an american convicted of cocaine 
smuggling in a case that attracted the attention of the us 
attorney general left prison sunday under a deal that allows him to 
serve his sentence in the united states 
conan owen 24 a photographer and a former summer intern in vice 
president george bushs office left carcel modelo in handcuffs and 
under police escort he had been held there since his arrest march 
13 1987 at barcelonas el prat airport 
as he walked through the prison patio to a waiting police van 
owen raised his hands defiantly to show he was handcuffed 
owen was taken to the barcelona police headquarters according to 
the officer in charge who demanded anonymity it was believed owen 
would spend the night there and be turned over to us marshals 
monday in time to catch a flight to new york 
owen was convicted in april of drug trafficking and sentenced to 
six years and a day 
at his march 26 trial owen testified he was tricked into 
carrying a suitcase from santiago chile to barcelona in which 
customs police found four pounds of cocaine he said the people who 
had given him a freelance photo assignment sent him to barcelona 
after a few days work in santiago 
jorge barahona who gave owen the assignment later told us 
officials he and others placed the cocaine in the suitcase without 
owens knowledge barahona provided that information to us 
officials in return for a suspended sentence and a promise he would 
not be turned over to spanish authorities 
the barcelona court refused to admit barahonas deposition as 
evidence in owens trial because pleabargaining is illegal in spain 
owens transfer to the united states is allowed under an 
international treaty spain and the united states signed in 1983 to 
become eligible for return owen had to drop his appeal of the 
trafficking conviction 
the prosecutor also dropped an appeal calling for an additional 
conviction on contraband charges which the threejudge barcelona 
court threw out 
owens attorney and the photographers family in annandale va 
have refused to discuss the case with reporters 
the spanish news media have questioned the degree of us 
interference in the countrys legal system after the personal appeal 
for owens release by thenattorney general edwin meese iii citing 
owens ties to meese and bush some newspapers claimed the 
photographer was an american spy 
during a weekly cabinet meeting oct 28 the spanish government 
agreed to owens request to be transferred to the united states in 
february a month before owens trial meese traveled to madrid to 
sign a supplementary extradtion treaty with spanish justice minister 
fernando ledesma 
at the time meese told reporters he was delivering a copy of 
barahonas deposition to ledesma in the hopes that charges against 
owen would be dropped 
after owens conviction meese said through a justice department 
spokesman that he regrets very much this action by the spanish 
courti think its important to stress that we continue to 
believe in mr owens innocence and we continue to hope that he 
will ultimately be exonerated 
according to the us embassy in madrid as of six months ago 
there were six americans serving time in spanish jails on 
drugrelated charges and another nine including owen who were 
awaiting trial on drug charges

here are excerpts from a speech 
delivered sunday by republican presidential candidate george bush 
i brought with me this issue book because you know were limited 
today to the sound bites 
were in the everythingkindofcontrolled no matter whether you 
give a good speech or a lousy one here it is on issues 350 
pages the issues and theyre issues that are of concern to the 
american people and weve been talking about them in depth on 
foreign affairs or education or ethics or whatever it is and 
somehow i think the american people are awful smart they dont need 
three or four huskyvoiced commentators to tell them what they know 
they know what they see they study 
americas prestige is on the move again were rolling up our 
sleeves to work not to have our pulse taken 
im a sportsman an outdoorsman i go hunting every year 
religiously love fishing love the parks and i am pledged to do a 
better job on the environment of ours i will push to clean up toxic 
waste i will stop ocean dumping i will save the oceans and protect 
and expand our beautiful parks that is my commitment that is my 
heartbeat 
we simply cannot go back to the policies of jimmy carter and 
walter mondale and turn over the white house to the very same people 
who claim to be on your side but who left america on its back 
they dont want that leadership to be flashy they want it to be 
solid they want it to be experienced they want leadership thats 
not going to make a lot of empty promises 
as i near the end of this very long arduous journey i think of 
the larger issues that this election is really about my thoughts 
keep coming back to the most serous responsibility of a president 
and that is advancing freedom and protecting the national security 
of the united states of america 
just yesterday the papers reported that the soviet union is 
hopefully temporarily but its halting now their withdrawal from 
afghanistan 
these events are a stark reminder that power remains a very 
important part of world politics to protect peace and advance the 
cause of freedom a president must have the experience to know when 
and how to use power the prudent use of power and be willing to do 
so when he has to do that and the new president of the united 
states believe me will be tested on all fronts afghanistan will 
only be one mr gorbachevs twists and turns present a great 
opportunity 
and yes theres hope as he wrestles now with glasnost the 
openness and peristroika the reform its a challenging time to 
lead the united states of america

west germans began a solemn 
remembrance sunday of the nazi kristallnacht the brutal night of 
terror a halfcentury ago that led to the holocaust 
residents of this picturesque town north of frankfurt placed a 
wreath at the site where the synagogue was burned down nov 10 1938 
over the next few days hundreds of local gatherings panel 
discussions and expositions will be held throughout west germany 
the major national day of observance takes place in frankfurt on 
wednesday 50 years to the day after the pogrom began 
in austria jewish leaders and city officials unveiled five 
plaques to commemorate the destruction of 49 vienna synagogues by 
nazi terror squads 
east germans for weeks have been staging kristallnacht 
ceremonies emphasizing how communists and jews were persecuted by 
the nazis 
peter kirchner the head of east berlins tiny jewish community 
said his nation appears to be learning more from the lessons of the 
past than west germany 
in the gdr east germany theres a greater cracking down on 
neofascist ways of thought than in the federal republic west 
germany where meetings of former nazis can take place under police 
protection kirchner said on west germanys deutschlandfunk radio 
the terror began the night of nov 9 1938 when nazi thugs 
burned synagogues destroyed jewish businesses and beat up jews 
the nazis dubbed the night kristallnacht or crystal night 
because of shards of broken glass that filled the streets 
josef foschepoth general secretary of west germanys societies 
for christianjewish cooperation said the kristallnacht marked 
the start of a new phase the phase of the physical annihilation 
of the jews 
historians agree the kristallnacht was the first major step in 
the systematic nazi campaign to annihilate european jews 
the nazis murdered an estimated 6 million jews and hundreds of 
thousands of other opponents during their 19331945 rule 
throughout the entire reich that night 91 jews met their death 
under the sticks boots and bullets of the death squads of the nazi 
movement foschepoth told 125 people in koenigstein 
at least 195 synagogues and about 7500 jewish businesses were 
either destroyed or badly damaged 
how was this all possible foschepoth asked we cant get 
away from this continuing question 
the extent of the ceremonies in the next few days reaching into 
even the smallest communities may be unprecedented in a country 
filled with public reminders of nazi terror 
heinz galinski the head of west germanys jewish community and a 
survivor of the auschwitz death camp has been at the center of a 
controversy over whether he should address parliament at its 
ceremony thursday 
it would have looked good for the reputation of west germany if 
one of those directly affected had been given the opportunity to 
say a public word from such a podium on that day especially because 
of the significance of that day galinski said last week 
he has not been invited 
about 32000 jews now live in west germany while the number of 
practicing jews in east germany is estimated to be 450 to 600 
along with solemn ceremonies there will also be reminders that 
times have changed in the city of darmstadt a 45minute drive 
south of frankfurt a new synagogue will be dedicated wednesday

konstantin u chernenko has become the latest 
exleader to lose an honor that was bestowed upon him after death 
the tass news agency said sunday that government officials 
rescinded a decision to name a passenger ship after chernenko who 
preceded mikhail s gorbachev as the communist party chief 
chernenko died march 11 1985 officials decided to name a 
polishbuilt ship capable of carrying 400 people and 150 cars after 
him the ship was commissioned in december 1986 
chernenko served as soviet leader just 13 months after the late 
yuri andropov and just before gorbachev he had been a lackluster 
brezhnev lieutenant and his rise to the top was considered the old 
guards last attempt at retaining power 
in the soviet union many things have been named and renamed as 
leaders most notably josef stalin and leonid brezhnev rise and 
fall in esteem 
in january authorities stripped a city town squares and a 
moscow neighborhood of the name of brezhnev the soviet leader from 
1964 to 1982 gorbachev blames brezhnev for a period of 
stagnation in the soviet economy creation of a cumbersome 
bureaucracy and public skepticism about the leadership 
after brezhnev died in 1982 a city of 460000 called 
naberezhnyie chelny was renamed for him along with an atomic 
icebreaker a naval vessel a passenger liner an army tank 
division a metallurgical institute a military academy a nuclear 
power plant and a dam 
dozens of cities were named for stalin and his lieutenants but 
they reverted back to their original names after the dictators 
death in 1953 
soviet history has only recently begun to acknowledge that stalin 
murdered millions of his own people

a letter from the dartmouth college trustees 
deploring a student newspapers comparison of the schools president 
with adolf hitler will be sent to all students and faculty members 
a spokesman said sunday 
chairman george munroe wrote the letter saturday to president 
james freedman saying the board of trustees is shocked and 
outraged at the characterization by the dartmouth review an 
offcampus weekly not affiliated with the college 
munroe called it particularly offensive in light of your own 
jewish heritage without stopping free and even offensive 
speech at the school he said the board has a right to speak out 
against ignorance and moral blindness 
college spokesman alex huppe said sunday the letter would be sent 
to every student and faculty member on monday 
the letter was in reaction to an oct 19 column in the review 
headlined ein reich ein volk ein freedmann a play on a nazi 
slogan one empire one people one leader but substituting and 
misspelling freedmans name 
written by james garrett the column describes how der 
freedmann and his associates rid the campus of conservatives the 
column refers to the final solution of the conservative problem 
and to survivors of the dartmouth holocaust garrett described 
dartmouth friends and colleagues who were deported in cattle cars 
in the night 
a drawing on the cover of the oct 26 issue depicted freedman as 
hitler 
huppe said freedman found the column distasteful and 
unpleasant 
a fullpage advertisement signed by four associate faculty deans 
attacking the review appeared last week in the dartmouth the 
official daily student newspaper as did a copy of a letter from 11 
faculty members to the reviews outside advisers 
the fact that president freedman is jewish raises the stakes in 
a rather frightening way the faculty members wrote urging the 
advisers to reconsider allowing their names to be associated with 
the publication the comparison of the dartmouth president to 
hitler is so wildly inappropriate that one can only assume insidious 
motives 
the dartmouth also took issue with its offcampus competitor in 
an editorial last week 
the column is antisemitic its impact rings through this 
community today and will remain long after its publishers have 
completed their stints in hanover the dartmouth said 
harmeet dhillon editor in chief of the review said the column 
wasnt antisemitic and that the point was misinterpreted 
she said the paper sought to compare liberal fascism with 
other forms of fascism and wasnt meant to trivialize the holocaust 
rather the paper wanted to show how freedman mistreated 
conservative students by trying to get rid of people he doesnt 
like 
we dont like him and we equated him with an antisemite she 
said we dont see how that makes us antisemitic it was 
excessive we admit that we obviously didnt think anyone would 
take it literally 
dhillon said the review had a tradition of support for jews and 
israel and that garrett had written a column a year ago condemning 
the palestine liberation organization 
she said freedmans jewish heritage didnt come up during 
discussions to print the column 
weve had a long war of words with president freedman she 
said 
in march freedman gave a speech denouncing review reporters as 
ideological provocateurs posing as journalists who engage in 
malicious bullying tactics that threaten dartmouths commitment 
to diversity 
that same month the college suspended three white review 
staffers for disrupting class and harassing a black professor the 
newspaper since has filed civil suits in state and federal courts 
against the college accusing it of reverse discrimination and 
freespeech violations

more than 800 salvadoran war refugees 
returned home sunday after spending eight years in a camp in 
honduras and said they were happy but fearful and wanted only to 
live and work in peace 
carrying their meager belongings the refugees crossed the border 
at el poy 60 miles north of san salvador in a convoy of 36 buses 
and 89 trucks 
vehicle problems delayed their departure saturday from the mesa 
grande camp 22 miles inside honduras and 50 miles east of el poy 
we fear for our lives because the repression continues said 
a young man who gave his name only as manuel my idea is to work 
the land and that they let us work in peace 
he said the refugees were returning to rebuild what the 
salvadoran army destroyed and it even massacred many families 
friends and brothers in the place where i lived he refused to 
comment further 
rigoberto lainez a refugee leader said we are all very happy 
to be in our country and we hope that they let us work in peace 
since our government told us we have the constitutional right to 
return to the places we are from 
the refugees join 4300 others who returned from honduras in 1987 
and 1230 who came back in august 
although some say the camps are like jails the un high 
commissioner for refugees says 14000 refugees have chosen to remain 
in honduras at mesa grande 3600 preferred to stayed behind 
despite the poverty and makeshift housing many said they were 
afraid to return to el salvador 
juan an 18yearold who has been at mesa grande since he was 10 
said in an interview there saturday he doesnt like the camp but 
felt he would be risking his life returning to el salvador 
back home the refugees will confront suspicions that they are 
collaborators of leftist guerrillas fighting a 9yearold war 
against the usbacked government 
they come to live near the hydroelectric dams and serve as 
suppliers of the guerrillas col ciro lopez roque commander of 
the 4th infantry brigade in chalatenango said 
interior minister edgar belloso funes who met the refugees as 
they returned said some are collaborators of the guerrillas but 
i cant say they all are 
refugee leader lainez questioned how the refugees could be 
accused of working with the guerrillas after living for eight years 
in a place where they cannot come or go without permission of the 
honduran army 
the honduran government has pushed for repatriation of the 
refugees for several years saying the camps have become sanctuaries 
for guerrillas who operate along the border 
about 65000 people have died in el salvadors civil war the 
majority of them civilians

the french turned out in record low numbers sunday 
for a referendum on the future of new caledonia but those who did 
vote overwhelmingly approved a plan the government hopes will buy 10 
years of peace in the pacific territory 
turnout was 3732 percent the lowest of any national election 
since world war ii 
the figure confirmed a widespread lack of interest in the 
referendum despite violence between native melanesians and european 
settlers that has killed 40 people in the past four years 
france has controlled the territory since 1853 
with 96 percent of the french results in and counting stopped for 
the night 7991 percent had voted yes on a statute that would 
clear the way for a 1998 vote on independence for new caledonia the 
no votes totaled 2009 percent 
in new caledonia 11000 miles from paris the polls closed 12 
hours before those in france official results there showed 5703 
percent voted yes and 429 percent no turnout was 6324 
percent 
democracy has spoken said premier michel rocard shortly 
after the french polls closed it appears that 12 million french 
have just approved the proposed new statute 
the voters were asked whether they approved a new local autonomy 
statute for the archipelago for the next 10 years followed by a 
local referendum on independence 
most of the native melanesians known as kanaks who make up 43 
percent of new caledonias 145000 inhabitants want independence 
from france they are opposed by most of the european settlers who 
comprise 37 percent and asians and polynesians who comprise 20 
percent 
sporadic violence has erupted between kanaks and the white 
population since 1984 culminating in a hostagetaking affair last 
spring that left 25 dead 
on april 22 a group of melanesians attacked a police station at 
fayaoue on the island of ouvea killing four policemen and taking 27 
hostage before retreating to a cave after negotiations failed 
police attacked the cave may 5 and rescued the hostages but 19 
melanesians and two policemen died 
that episode sobered both proindependence and antiindependence 
leaders and brought them to the negotiating table in june 
jeanmarie tjibaou leader of the kanak socialist national 
liberation front and jacques lafleur head of the rally for 
caledonia in the republic party signed an agreement in paris 
under the agreement 
those charged with political crimes committed before aug 20 
will be amnestied except those directly implicated in murder 
the archipelago will be divided into three provinces each with 
its own provincial assembly the three assemblies will together form 
a territorial congress 
new caledonia will be governed directly from paris until july 
1989 when local administrations will take over 
a program of economic development and administrative training 
will be implemented 
in 1998 a referendum will be held on independence but only 
those people now residents of new caledonia will be able to vote 
only the extreme right french party national front has campaigned 
for a no vote in the referendum

jesse jackson said sunday there would be more 
enthusiasm in the us presidential election if he were a candidate 
but he said the democrats can pull off a victory like harry trumans 
or john kennedys 
jackson who lost the democratic nomination to gov michael 
dukakis of massachusets said in a london weekend television 
interview he does not believe vice president george bush will win 
tuesday just because he now leads in the polls 
in other british television interviews shown sunday dukakis 
accused bush of running a negative campaign and said he waited too 
long to respond he also said he would never wage a negative 
campaign even if it mean certain victory 
bush said dukakis has run from the label liberal because the 
words connotation in american politics has changed 
bush and dukakis were interviewed separately by david frost for 
his sunday morning program on tvam the republican candidate was 
interviewed in washington nov 1 and dukakis was interviewed in 
kansas city oct 22 
its not over until its over said jackson who was 
interviewed from chicago 
i would think that with the surge the democrats are now feeling 
across the country gaps closing in states like california new 
york michigan illinois if we continue this momentum through the 
weekend we could be just at that miracle quotient that truman 
experienced in 1948 and john kennedy later in 1960 he said 
interviewer brian walden asked jackson whether he believed that 
because he isnt on the ticket blacks will be disillusioned and 
stay away from the polls 
blacks have been disillusioned and yet blacks are resilient 
jackson said but he conceded there would be a higher degree of 
enthusiasm if he were a candidate 
asked what his role in the administration would be if the 
democrats win jackson replied weve discussed no role and i have 
no interest at this point in a role 
frost asked bush whether he believes liberal is a bad word 
well i think there are certain things in the liberal tradition 
standing up for the little guy thats good but liberal has taken 
on a different connotation in american politics or else why would 
the opponent have been running away from the label for so long 
bush responded 
frost then asked bush whether he was glad dukakis was now 
describing himself as a liberal in the tradition of franklin 
roosevelt harry truman and john kennedy 
he can do what he wants to do i think i have every right to 
point it out in the second debate he got all over me like ugly on 
an ape for even bringing it up bush said using a phrase he said 
he first heard in the texas oil fields in 1948 
dukakis described himself as a liberal in the tradition of 
the presidents who gave america social security the minimum wage 
and medicare but added im also a lot more fiscally conservative 
than vice president bush 
he accused the republicans of attempting to convey the sense 
that if youre a quote liberal you dont have values you dont 
have standards 
now why are they doing this i think its because they want 
people to forget that in a very real sense theyve had one of the 
most liberal borrow and spending sprees weve ever had in this 
country its the antithesis of conservatism 
dukakis said he reacted too slowly to the negative kind of 
campaigning that apparently was part and parcel of republican 
strategy from the beginning but he said he could never wage a 
relentlessly negative campaign even if it meant certain victory in 
the election

here are excerpts of democrat michael 
dukakis speech sunday 
for months george bush has been following me around on the 
issues have you noticed he discovered education a few months ago 
he even discovered the environment a few months ago after being a 
member of the original wrecking crew that went to washington 
remember in 1981 
in recent days hes been following me around the country and 
now hes following me to colorado ill tell you one place hes not 
going to follow me hes not following lloyd bentsen and me to 1600 
pennsylvania avenue ill tell you that 
hes slipping and sliding were rocking and rolling arent we 
were taking our case directly to the american people hes 
trying to keep dan quayle away from the american people have you 
noticed 
he thinks you can inherit the white house i think you have to 
earn the right to be president of the united staters 
the republcians have run the most critical and the most 
hypocritical campaign i think ive ever seen in my political career 
full of distortions and lies and just plain garbage 
but as they slip theyre going to become more and more 
desperate and youre going to be seeing and hearing more of this 
right up to tuesday the latest one is gun control 
youve been hearing about it havent you here in colorado 
ive always supported the rights of hunters and sportsmen to buy and 
own weapons and to use them thats not what im concerned about 
its not what youre concerned about were concerned about 
teenagers with uzis and ak47s running around our cities killing 
people 
were concerned about crack gangs and drug dealers that are 
threatening the lives of our law enforcement officers were 
concerned about cop killer bullets we think there ought to be at 
least a sevenday waiting period before a convicted felon or 
somebody with a history of mental illness walks into a store and 
buys a gun thats what were concerned about 
i support the right of people to protect themselves in their 
own homes subject to state regulation this is a law enforcement 
issue thats what it is and thats what im talking about and i 
hope youll take that message back to your friends and your 
communities 
we cant let these lies and distortions stand unanswered in 
this campaign and were not going to were not going to

two people possibly leftist extremists 
were killed and two others injured in a latenight bombing of 
several electrical towers that blacked out much of central chile 
police said sunday 
in telephone calls to local newspapers the countrys principle 
urban guerrilla group the manuel rodriguez patriotic front claimed 
responsibility for blowing up at least eight highvoltage towers in 
central chile shortly after 10 pm saturday 
its a warning to military president augusto pinochet the 
santiago daily la epoca quoted a spokesman for the group as saying 
hes got to go 
the 72yearold pinochet lost an oct 5 referendum on extending 
his rule open elections to pick a successor are planned for late 
next year but political opponents are calling on pinochet to step 
down sooner 
the blasts knocked out power to a 400mile expanse including this 
capital city where more than 4 million of the countrys 12 million 
people live the outage stretched from san fernando 90 miles south 
of santiago to la serena 295 miles to the north 
in temuco 420 miles south of santiago police said they found 
the badly damaged bodies of a man and a woman killed the previous 
night in the bombing of an electrical pole police said a knapsack 
containing explosives and two handguns was found near the bodies

also sunday an antigovernment street rally called by labor 
unions to demand pinochets resignation drew only a few thousand 
people 
neither organizers nor police gave a crowd estimate but 
journalists calculated attendance at no more than 5000 much lower 
than the hundreds of thousands who attended rallies before the 
referendum

a pastor appealed sunday for spiritual 
understanding of the terrorists holding nine americans hostage in 
the middle east as an interdenominational service pondered news from 
lebanon 
oh god of all people teach us how to pray now for those we 
identify as enemies in our lives said the rev thomas kojis who 
was aboard a jetliner in greece that was damaged by a terrorist bomb 
in 1986 
kojis pastor of the wauwatosa avenue united methodist church 
was among seven clergy of several denominations participating in a 
prayer service for the hostages at the underwood memorial baptist 
church in wauwatosa a milwaukee suburb 
kojis said he wanted to discuss the captors as well and what 
might have motivated them to take terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was captured march 16 
1985 and is the longestheld us hostage 
a videotape in which anderson says president reagan and vice 
president george bush have not done enough to secure his release 
surfaced last monday sundays event was planned for several months 
and was not intended as a political message said the rev reid 
trulson pastor at the host church about 50 people attended 
they spoke about anderson and the other hostages the hostages 
families and those negotiating for their release with shadowy 
captors 
part of us wants to destroy our enemies terminate them wipe 
them off the face of the earth part of us is blinded in the dark 
about who the captors really are kojis said some of us here 
have neatly divided the situation into two camps us and them 
deeper than those things that divide us from the captors there 
is that which unites us we are all brothers and sisters he said 
kojis said he and his family have had time to recover since a 
bomb exploded across the aisle from them in a twa jetliner april 2 
1986 killing four occupants 
when he heard what the other pastors planned to say during the 
memorial service he said he chose to concentrate on the captors 
because it was going involve a lot of reflection 
to try to walk in your enemies shoes to empathize which 
seems so difficult he said how do you walk in the shoes of 
your captor i think those are all the challenges that await us in 
faith 
anderson was a particular focus of the service because of the 
attention surrounding his recent birthday the videotape and new 
photographs of him distributed last month 
one photo was delivered to a western news agency friday along 
with a statement from the islamic jihad or holy war saying 
washington would not take realistic steps to end the ordeal of 
14 captives held in lebanon nine of whom are american 
in the most recent photograph anderson is pictured before a 
birthday cake oct 27 was his 41st birthday

her aidsrelated illness has died she was 33 
ms ramos who lived in cambridge died friday 
a middlesex superior court jury in january found dr kenneth

aids patients 
bernstein testified that he diagnosed ms ramos as having 
bronchitis and asthma based on xrays physical exams and clinical 
judgment 
while the legal fight was important to her personally it was 
her efforts against aids that were the most important activities to 
her in the last days of her life said her attorney paul collier

progressed was committed to publicizing advocating and educating 
people about the importance of the struggle against aids

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen said sunday that the presidential campaign no matter who 
wins will not leave the next president with a serious mandate 
that means more work and a lot more swabbing that has to be 
done and i think mike dukakis can do that he said of his partys 
standardbearer 
bentsen appeared on both nbctvs meet the press and on 
cbstvs face the nation nbc said republican dan quayle had 
also been invited but turned down the invitation and journalists on 
the show said quayle had appeared on no national television 
interview shows during the campaign 
on cbs bentsen predicted that congressional democrats would not 
gang up on bush if bush were elected 
not gang up no but i dont think he gets any brownie points 
from the kind of campaign hes run its been an extremely 
negative one the texas senator said 
bentsen reiterated his indignation at the republicans negative 
advertising 
theyve had an effect and theyve hurt and they demean the 
process he told nbc bushs wife and one of his sons defended the 
vice president on cbs you cant persuade me that george has run a 
dirty campaign said barbara bush he hasnt 
jeb bush said dukakis was fair game and he didnt expect his 
father to face resentment if elected my dad has a great ability 
to heal wounds he said 
bentsen asked if bush would find a stalemate greeting him 
because of a lack of a mandate on specific issues said frankly 
i dont think either candidate at this point has a serious mandate 
afterward he told reporters michael dukakis will not have as 
much of a mandate as he deserves because it was difficult to get the 
issues across with all the clutter of negative advertising but i 
also believe the two of us together with me as vice president 
that we will be able to get our legislative program through better 
than george bush and dan quayle would 
bentsen said that if he returned to his post as chairman of the 
senate finance committee he would not try to use that forum to 
wreak vengeance on bush 
we have to much at stake in this country to try to seek revenge 
or something like that he said were on a mountain of debt in 
this country and our budget deficit and our trade deficit and 
those things have to be turned around 
id work with any president for my country id help when i 
thought he was right and id try to block him when i thought he was 
wrong bentsen said thats what i hired out to do 
asked to look at 1992 if the republicans won this time the 
67yearold bentsen declined to say if hed run for president 
i believe in 1992 ill be running for vice president and 
mike dukakis will be finishing a first and successful term of 
office he said 
when reporters asked him later if this was his last campaign he 
joked what do you mean a kid like me ive been in politics long 
enough to know to never say never 
bentsen headed back to his home state of texas after appearing on 
the network interview shows in chicago 
bush strategist and pollster robert teeter said his surveys 
showed texas the state that dukakis chose bentsen to help win was 
firmly in bushs column and a statewide newspaper poll backed up 
that assertion 
a survey sponsored by the dallas morning news and the houston 
chronicle gave bush a 5639 lead in texas the survey had a 
fourpoint margin of error 
if they had it all locked up why is the bushquayle campaign 
dumping a half million dollars in negative ads in the state 
bentsen said at a rally in corpus christi president reagans stop 
in the state and republican party spending were also evidence it was 
close he said 
lets go flat out for the next couple of days he told the 
crowd of about 800 in the local civic center 
in el paso bentsen told a rally outside the citys train station 
that the democrats are concerned about the middle class a theme 
dukakis has been hammering in his campaign stops 
mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are on the side of the working 
men and women of america and the republicans are on the other 
side said the democratic candidate who addressed the crowd in 
both spanish and english an appeal to the states large hispanic 
population 
as bentsens motorcade worked its way through the streets of el 
paso citizens honked their car horns with approval

police were preparing for about 2000 
people to attend the funeral monday of a cadet who became ill and 
needed a liver transplant after a vigorous training program at a 
police academy 
timothy shepard 25 was one of 16 cadets hospitalized during the 
first week of training at the state police academy in agawam the 
cases of exhaustion and dehydration among the class of 50 cadets 
prompted at least three state inquiries and resulted in the 
resignation of the head of the states police training program 
pittsfield police lt gerald lee called shepards sudden turn for 
the worst last week a shocking change 
the cadet had emerged from a coma and was slowly recovering 
even writing his wife holly i made it although he was too 
weak to breathe or speak on his own he lost consciousness oct 31 
and was operated on to remove a blood clot on his brain 
he never regained consciousness and died wednesday an autopsy on 
friday indicated that he died from infections that set in because of 
his weakened condition from the training and from the transplant 
among the 2000 people expected to attend mondays funeral were 
most of pittsfields 86 officers 40 officers from nearby 
springfield and 46 cadets still training at agawam 
state police had planned to send six cruisers of troopers but 
scaled back their plans after shepards family asked that state 
police not attend the funeral the family withdrew the request 
sunday 
lee said 50 police departments from new england and new york sent 
their color guards 
shepard collapsed from heat stroke sept 19 at the end of the 
grueling first day of training other cadets reported that they were 
put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of 
water 
five days before shepard died attorney general james shannon 
released the results of an investigation into the illnesses that 
found a massive failure of the system led to abusive training

george bush and michael dukakis both laid claim sunday to 
precious lastminute momentum in their campaign marathon the vice 
president confidently saying the tide was moving in our 
direction and his combative rival insisting he was rocking and 
rolling to an upset victory 
the national polls said it would take a massachusetts miracle for 
dukakis to win on tuesday there aint no stopping us now unless 
we stop ourselves said the vice president 
the political equivalent of a nuclear exchange occurred on 
television where the republicans and democrats spent millions of 
dollars in advertising for the waning hours of the campaign the two 
candidates bought time for 30minute commercials on all three major 
networks for election eve on monday 
both candidates battled the clock and physical exhaustion in a 
final drive to snare undecided voters and nail down the presidency 
gallup said bush was ahead by 12 percentage points and usa 
todaycnn said the vice president led by 11 abc made it 10 and cbs 
put the margin at nine an nbc newswall street journal poll and 
another by harris reported a 5point edge for the vice president and 
said there was still plenty of room for last minute changes 
an associated press tabulation showed bush leading for 356 
electoral votes although he could not yet count securely on the 270 
needed for victory the tabulation showed dukakis leading for 101 
electoral votes while 78 were in tossup states including 
pennsylvania illinois and missouri 
a 50state poll by abc news and the washington post put 25 states 
firmly in bushs column and another 16 leaning his way which would 
provide more than the necessary 270 only the district of columbia 
was firm for dukakis 
we cant turn the white house over to the people who claim to 
be on our side but who left the country on its back bush said at 
stops in colorado springs colo and los angeles 
countered dukakis also beginning his day in colorado hes 
slipping and sliding were rocking and rolling he sought to 
raise fears over the possibility that bush if elected might put 
vice presidential running mate dan quayle in charge of the white 
house crisis management team 
gives you the chills doesnt it dukakis asked think 
about it the cuban missile crisis with dan quayle in charge 
democrats voiced confidence they would retain or perhaps widen 
their majorities in the house and senate in tuesdays balloting and 
they got little dissent from republicans on that score 
one of the tightest senate races was in florida where a 
latehour poll showed a virtual dead heat between democratic rep 
buddy mackay and republican rep connie mack for the seat being 
vacated by democratic sen lawton chiles 
democrats also hoped for modest gains among the 12 statehouse 
races on the ballot 
it was the costliest campaign in american history and just one 
piece of it a series of california ballot initiatives had a price 
tag of more than 100 million 
both men drew large crowds in the campaigns final days and drew 
strength from them and in the final two days the presidential 
candidates thought no more about flying across the country than most 
voters thought about walking across the street 
bush aide alixe glen described the vice presidents rapidly 
changing itinerary as a magical mystery tour dukakis embarked 
on two days of nonstop campaigning that would carry him from the 
west coast to the midwest back to california and then back home to 
massachusetts by election morning 
a series of state polls provided a picture of several close 
races one poll gave bush a 17point lead in texas with its 29 
electoral votes but dukakis was reported gaining on bush in the 
latest survey in colorado and holding an eightpoint lead in iowa 
nbc news and the wall street journal said its nationwide survey 
completed saturday night showed the vice president with a lead of 48 
percent to 43 percent an erosion over two weeks ago 
bush pollster robert teeter interviewed on the nbctvs meet 
the press rejected complaints that the vice president had run a 
nasty campaign and said private gop surveys showed bush leading by a 
bigger margin than reported by the network 
teeter said he believed the number of voters who were wavering 
was much lower somewhat under 10 percent 
bush professed little doubt about the outcome tuesday 
things are moving in our direction he said as he raced 
sunday from colorado to california to michigan 
dukakis in a desperate race noted that both candidates began 
the day in colorado 
for months george bush has been following me around on the 
issues he discovered education a few months ago he even discovered 
the environment a few months ago he said 
this week he started following me around on my message telling 
people hes on your side now hes following me around the country 
ill tell you one place hes not going to follow me hes not 
following lloyd bentsen and me to 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
bentsen the vice presidential nominee flew from illinois to 
texas in a final bid to prevent bush from taking his home state 
in an nbc interview bentsen conceded that no matter which 
candidate won he wouldnt have much of a mandate after the election 
he also said that if he returned to the senate in a bush 
administration he would help bush when he thought it was deserved 
and try to block him when he thought the president was wrong 
quayle who shows up as a drag on the republican ticket in 
virtually all the polls declined invitations to appear on network 
television and campaigned sunday in virginia one of the safest 
republican states where a new poll showed bush with a 5625 lead 
dukakis used his 30minute campaignclosing commercial to show 
himself responding to questions from average americans and to 
trumpet the populist theme that has adopted in the hope of scoring 
an upset on tuesday 
look in the mirror and ask yourself he says in a film clip 
taken from a rally is george bush on your side

andrei d sakharov arrived here sunday to visit 
with relatives and undergo medical tests on his first visit outside 
the soviet union after years of agitation over soviet human rights 
policies 
speaking through a translator the tall balding physicist and 
nobel laureate called himself a free man but said others remain in 
prison who helped him through his years in internal exile in a 
soviet city closed to westerners 
two years ago i became a free man when i returned from gorky 
to moscow now i have become even freer because i have been granted 
the right to travel around the world sakharov told reporters 
during a brief meeting 
but a man who staged a oneperson demonstration on my behalf in 
january 1980 when i was exiled to gorky remains in prison the name 
of that man is vazif meilanov and i feel it is my duty now at 
this moment to remember this man and many others who remain in 
prison 
meilanov is a soviet mathematician 
among the relatives sakharov will visit in the boston area are 
his stepson alexei semyonov semyonovs wife liza alekseyeva and 
their 4yearold daughter alexandra whom he never has seen 
sakharov also will participate in the first board meeting outside 
the soviet union of the international foundation for the survival 
and development of humanity the foundation was formed in january by 
soviet and us scientists and educators to support research on 
global problems 
i think that my country and your country can do a great 
deal together for peace and to eliminate hunger and violence 
sakharov said 
he began his remarks by saying that he has a great deal of 
respect for the united states which he said is indeed a truly 
great country 
sakharov said he has a special feeling for the city of boston 
because it gave shelter to my dear ones 
sakharov was accompanied to the news conference by his 
stepdaughter and her husband tatiana and efrem yankelevich he will 
stay with the couple in newton during his visit 
during his stay he will undergo tests at massachusetts general 
hospital for a heart condition and possible implantation of a 
pacemaker 
he is scheduled to travel to washington to attend the board 
meeting of the foundation which is chaired by yevgeny velikhov 
vice president of the soviet academy of sciences velikhov 
accompanied sakharov on the trip from the soviet union 
sakharovs wife yelena bonner remained in moscow 
his twoweek trip comes less than two years after he was freed 
from internal exile stemming from his opposition to the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan 
sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize for his human rights 
activities told reporters at moscows sheremetyevo airport earlier 
that he was pleased to be going to washington for a meeting of the 
international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity 
sakharov 67 kissed his wife in a diplomatic lounge where they 
had waited smiling and holding hands and then headed for the new 
yorkbound plane reporters who went to the airport were not allowed 
in the lounge but could watch from a distance 
on a brief walk from a white volga sedan to the lounge he told 
reporters there still are political prisoners in the soviet union 
including an unknown number in mental institutions 
sakharov left using the blue passport of a member of an official 
delegation not a red passport of an average soviet citizen he was 
traveling with yevgeny velikhov vice president of the soviet 
academy of sciences both men are members of the board of the 
foundation 
the granting of an exit visa to sakharov was a dramatic 
indication of the changes in soviet society under mikhail s 
gorbachev sakharov helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb but in 
the 1970s became a leader in the soviet dissident movement 
sakharov was exiled to the closed industrial city of gorky in 
january 1980 for his criticism of the soviet military intervention 
in afghanistan the previous month his wife was banished to gorky as 
well in august 1984 
sakharov remained there until gorbachev called him back to moscow 
in december 1986 earlier that year gorbachev had told a french 
newspaper sakharov could not travel outside the soviet union because 
he knew too many state secrets 
sakharov has continued his scientific work and now concentrates 
on the origins of the universe he speaks out occasionally on human 
rights issues 
in june he said gorbachev deserves to be given time and trust in 
his efforts to reform soviet society but in september told 
reporters he saw signs that gorbachev was backtracking on some 
elements of his reforms 
the international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity was formed in january by soviet and american scientists and 
educators the groups headquarters is in moscow but it has offices 
in stockholm and washington 
its board meeting will be held in washington nov 1317

democrat michael dukakis battling 
against the clock to keep his presidential hopes alive heaped scorn 
on the republican ticket sunday and accused george bush of 
following me around on the issues 
dukakis campaigned across the west in an urgent final appeal for 
votes before tuesdays election aides pointed with enthusiasm to 
new polls showing him continuing to narrow the gop nominees lead 
i can smell victory in the air the democratic nominee told a 
rally of 10000 people in the denver suburb of westminster within 
sight of the snowcapped rocky mountains hes slipping and 
sliding were rocking and rolling 
dukakis later spoke to a crowd estimated at 10000 people 
outdoors at portland state university in oregon where he charged 
bush was following him around the country 
theyre getting so worried bush is following me around can 
you believe it he said 
were taking our case to the american people dukakis said 
hes trying to keep dan quayle away from the american people 
dukakis schedule remained in flux as aides tried to figure where 
to send him in the final hours of the 1988 campaign 
he planned to fly from the northwest late sunday evening for 
cleveland and st louis then jet back to the west coast for a 
midday event in san francisco a later event was also being planned 
in an undisclosed site 
dukakis was keeping an aroundtheclock campaign schedule that 
would have him flying to events all night sunday night and monday 
night without stop 
despite unanimity in the polls that he was trailing dukakis at 
each stop asserted he would win 
were going to win here he said in portland were going 
to win in washington were going to win in california were going 
to win a victory and a great victory 
clearly buoyed by cheering crowds dukakis said in colorado that 
bush had been mimicking his own concerns on major issues and had 
even borrowed his populist im on your side campaign slogan 
george bush has been following me around on the issues 
dukakis said he discovered education a few months ago hes 
even discovered the environment 
ill tell you one place hes not going to follow me hes not 
following lloyd bentsen and me to 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
renewing his harsh attacks on republican vice presidential 
nominee dan quayle dukakis quoted bush as saying on a tv interview 
saturday that if elected he might put quayle in charge of the white 
house crisis management group 
bush said it could be but that he hadnt decided but if 
bush did dukakis said it would mean the youthful indiana senator 
would be responsible for managing the nations response to the 
gravest international incidents gives you the chills doesnt 
it dukakis said 
think about it the cuban missile crisis with dan quayle in 
charge thats a risk we americans cant afford to take he 
said 
dan quayle is not a crisis manager hes a crisis that has to 
be managed thats what theyve been trying to do since august 
in tacoma wash dukakis spoke to a crowd of 7000 people at the 
university of puget sound and took questions from a small group of 
students afterward 
he blasted bush for what he said was a refusal by the vice 
president to visit the school when the gop nominee heard he would be 
asked to take questions 
how can you be president of the united states if you dont want 
to answer some questions dukakis said 
dukakis advisers were encouraged by an nbc news poll released 
sunday that showed their candidate had narrowed the gap to five 
percentage points with the vice president leading 48 percent to 43 
percent 
they also said recent polls suggested dukakis was getting the 
larger share of voters who were only now making up their minds which 
candidate they will support 
but they were aware that dukakis remained well behind bush in 
some critical states dukakis campaigned in texas late saturday 
night just as a houston chronicle poll showed him trailing bush by 
17 percentage points in that state 
dukakis strategists also were paying a lot of attention to ohio 
where polls have shown bush ahead and the republicans investing 
heavily in the outcome 
campaign chairman paul brountas said the candidate is moving in 
most of the battleground states many of them are becoming dead 
heats and in many of them were moving ahead 
dukakis himself while shaking hands with supporters put it 
simply were surging 
dukakis was accompanied on his flight from texas to colorado by 
actress carrie fisher among the tv actors accompanying him were hal 
linden and john larroquette of the night court program 
dukakis said republican attacks on the gun control issue were 
typical of what he called his opponents campaign of distortions 
and lies 
in a region where guns are a major issue dukakis reaffirmed his 
support for gun ownership by hunters and sportsmen and by 
individuals subject to state regulation for their 
selfprotection 
this is a law enforcement issue dukakis said we cant let 
these lies and distortions stand unanswered in this campaign and 
were not going to 
in texas late saturday night dukakis denounced the republicans 
for big brother tactics he said were aimed at intimidating 
hispanics into not voting 
the democratic nominee urged bush to halt gop ads in the rio 
grande valley warning that election officials will be watching 
polling places to see if noncitizens try to vote

the nations home heating oil supplies are 
adequate even if the united states has a very cold winter according 
to an analysis by the american petroleum institute 
the washingtonbased trade organization said in a report released 
monday that based on its analysis of recent us energy information 
administration figures home heating oil demand this winter would 
range from about 324 million to 352 million barrels per day 
total supply for the 198889 winter season based on us 
refinery production net imports and inventory drawdowns will range 
from 327 million barrels a day to 377 million barrels a day 
depending on the level of demand according to apis analysis 
the group said those amounts would be more than adequate to 
meet anticipated demand barring some unforeseen interruption in the 
supply or transportation system 
actual demand will depend on factors such as the weather oil 
prices and us economic growth the group said 
for example a winter that was 10 percent colder than normal 
would boost demand by 75000 barrels a day demand would be 40000 
barrels a day higher if heating oil prices were about 1250 a 
barrel instead of the 1650 a barrel price projected by the energy 
information administration and would rise by another 25000 barrels 
a day if the economic growth rate was 1 percentage point higher than 
the 225 percent growth projected by the eia
