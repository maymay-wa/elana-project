an explosion shattered a twostory 
bank tuesday killing three people and injuring 14 others 
officials said two people were listed in serious condition 
firefighters and volunteers dug by hand through the rubble of 
the downtown crested butte national bank to pull out survivors 
witnesses said the entire building was leveled except for the 
vault 
the cause of the blast in this rocky mountain ski resort was not 
immediately determined but authorities said they were 
investigating the possibility of a bomb or methane gas buildup 
crested butte police chief hank smith said two restaurants 
received bomb threats over the week and one of them was evacuated 
mayor wes light said three bodies were pulled from the rubble 
and the 14 others believed inside during the explosion were pulled 
out 
a huge explosion occurred i felt the floor drop beneath me 
said bank teller joe sabino who was treated at gunnison county 
hospital for scratches and burns on his hands 
fortunately nothing came into contact with me sabino said 
it the rubble built a little cave around me i was little bit 
upside down 
the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms sent a 
12person response team to the scene and gov roy romer made 
national guard units available to provide assistance if needed 
the explosion occurred at 915 am shortly after the bank 
opened 
about 200 people responded quickly to the scene and started 
digging with their hands 
they started digging through the rubble helping the people 
who were still alive said mark reaman a photographer for the 
chronicle amp pilot newspaper 
the whole town would suddenly become silent stopping to see 
if they could hear someone it was the most eerie thing ive ever 
heard luckily many times they found someone who was still alive 
the dead were identified as bank employees jade woelk donna 
smith and monica henning their ages were not available 
thom cox the bank president was in st marys hospital in 
grand junction where he underwent leg surgery and was being treated 
for possible broken ribs officials said he was reported in 
serious but stable condition 
roxy lypps was admitted to intensive care with second and 
thirddegree burns over 30 to 40 percent of her body and was in 
serious but stable condition 
hope ostheimer who works nearby said the building completely 
collapsed on itself 
people started running from their cars and businesses and just 
started digging said a passerby who identified himself only by 
his first name brad 
i started digging but i wigged out when i saw the condition 
of one of the victims he said one guy crawled out but the 
rest were trapped 
dusty demerson who was in his shop at color west photography 
about a block from the bank also went to investigate 
the president of the bank was hanging out the back of the 
bank by his legs and we got him down he said 
by that time ambulances arrived and demerson also started 
digging for survivors 
six of the injured were taken to gunnison county hospital 30 
miles away the others were treated at clinics the mayor said 
tom yates chief of the gunnison police department said three 
people were in critical condition 
bob gillen communications director for the crested butte ski 
area said the resort put its disaster plan into effect and handled 
rescue operations 
were doing this as if this was an avalanche because what we 
have here is a material avalanche he said theyre doing it by 
hand we have some heavy equipment there but most of the rescuers 
are using their hands 
there was an explosion but there are no natural gas lines in 
there were puzzled by it said gillen it doesnt make 
sense 
im not ruling out a bomb and im not ruling out an explosion 
from methane buildup smith said weve just completed the 
rescue effort and were just now beginning the investigation 
crested butte population about 1000 is 9000 feet high in the 
western colorado mountains 
heavy snow hampered rescue efforts and delayed the arrival of 
ambulances from gunnison gillen said an airplane did manage to 
land in gunnison and stood by to take victims to st marys 
hospital in grand junction western colorados largest hospital 
bank officials said they plan to open up a temporary bank on 
wednesday in another building

raymond buckey pleaded innocent tuesday to 
eight revived charges involving three girls in the mcmartin 
preschool molestation case after his attorney requested that a sex 
charge slated for dismissal be retained 
i am innocent your honor i plead not guilty buckey told 
superior court judge stanley m weisberg the judge formally 
dismissed four unresolved charges against buckey and held in 
abeyance one contested charge 
the case now has been reduced from hundreds of counts that once 
involved 41 alleged abuse victims from the nowdefunct manhattan 
beach preschool 
defense attorney danny davis asked the judge not to dismiss one 
allegation against buckey involving the son of judy johnson the 
mother whose complaints triggered the investigation saying it 
would allow him to present to jurors the genesis of this case 
the defense has previously said the case was the result of 
community hysteria churned by mrs johnson who also accused a los 
angeles school board member of molesting her child she has since 
died of a liver ailment related to alcoholism 
it seems a little strange that the defense would be objecting 
to the dismissal of this particular count but im willing to 
listen weisberg said 
at an afternoon hearing weisberg denied the request as well as 
a defense motion to remove the los angeles district attorneys 
office from the case 
davis said statements by district attorney ira reiner indicate 
he has forfeited objectivity in the case he cited a state supreme 
court ruling that in the test of a prosecutors office decision to 
pursue charges it is not that it shall win a case but that 
justice shall be done 
deputy district attorney joseph martinez said reiner has a right 
to his opinion 
what the da is saying is that he believes mr buckey to have 
committed these offenses what kind of a da would say that he is 
going to prosecute someone that he feels is innocent martinez 
asked before the hearing 
there were 13 counts unresolved by jurors in the trial which 
lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than 10 million 
jurors in the first trial were leaning toward acquittal of the 
charges involving the three youngsters in the new trial 
i dont know why theyre doing it buckey said outside the 
courtroom before his arraignment on the renewed charges theyve 
got three of their weakest witnesses 
buckey predicted trial would take a year another year of 
mcmartin minimcmartin chiseled down as this case goes into 
overtime falling apart until finally the second jury kicks it 
out 
davis said two of the three children testified at the first 
trial and included fantastic accounts of molestation he also said 
at other stages of the case they recanted and then restated the 
allegations 
they will say ray buckey wore a beard and a mustache flew in 
an airplane we will have stories of a house with seven eight 
bubble baths being taken by children all over the house stories of 
a farmer bill stories of going to a ranch said davis referring 
to the previous testimony by the girls 
when buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey finally came 
to trial in 1987 what had originally been hundreds of counts of 
child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared count of 
conspiracy and five other defendants were dropped the 41 children 
once said to have been abused was reduced to 11

amidullahs shoerepair shop is a 
rough wooden box in which he can barely stand erect he is 9 years 
old and has been the chief support of a large family since his 
father was killed two months ago 
in the muddy market lanes of kabul small boys and old men 
compete for jobs pulling carts loaded with sacks of soviet flour 
japanese television sets and cartons of west german hand lotion 
the human mules even tow shiny red motorbikes to showrooms rather 
than ride them 
most young men seen in the capital are in uniform the others 
usually are on crutches their feet or entire legs lost to land 
mines in a dozen years of civil war 
in a factory outside a military base about 1000 women make 
army uniforms only 20 percent are married but about 50 percent 
have become pregnant one said shaking her head sadly she and 
others said prostitution is a disturbing new phenomenon in kabul 
life has never been easy in this ancient land whose name 
conjures mystery intrigue and adventure today the traditional 
hardscrabble existence is compounded by a war that has produced 
neither victor nor vanquished and wont go away 
afghanistans descent into war began in 1973 when mohammad daoud 
deposed his cousin king zahir shah while the king was abroad 
daoud was assassinated in april 1978 in a communist coup 
the kremlin sent military forces in december 1979 to rescue its 
proteges from internal power struggles and a war with moslem 
guerrillas the insurgents get most of their support from the 
united states pakistan and saudi arabia 
in the 12 years since the 1978 coup the party has changed 
leaders twice by assassination and once in a power play either 
engineered or supported by the soviets that installed president 
najib in 1986 
soviet combat forces withdrew a year ago leaving the afghan 
army to fight the guerrillas alone 
to the surprise of the united states and others government 
troops have not merely held their own but have expanded their area 
of control reopening supply routes and making deals with local 
guerrilla commanders 
limited success has come at a high price 
the government says half its resources go the war effort in a 
chaotic economy children and teenagers who work as manual 
laborers and prostitutes earn more than their fathers who have 
government jobs according to interviews with kabul residents of 
all social levels 
i think this war is making us more backward said a kabul 
professional educated in eastern europe who insisted his name not 
be used 
the generation of 12 to 15yearolds they will be 
illiterate you will have a generation sick with noneducation 
with heroin and hashish this is a result of i dont know war 
revolution government peoples hate its very sad 
in his wooden cubicle which he opened soon after his father 
died in an auto crash barefoot amidullah handed a pair of highly 
polished black boots to a customer 
he said he earned about 100 afghanis a day three times what his 
12yearold brother wahidullah makes working in a bakery amidullah 
is the main breadwinner for his mother and his seven brothers and 
sisters 
at the unrealistic official rate amidullahs earnings translate 
to 181 a day but amount to only 20 cents at the more accurate 
black market rate 
amidullah said the combined earnings of the two brothers were 
sometimes enough for food sometimes not 
said omar sells rocklike lumps of brown crudely refined sugar 
at the mujahedeen market on kabuls outskirts the market got its 
name because the goods sold there are from territory held by the 
guerrillas who call themselves mujahedeen or holy warriors 
omar 48 said he had four sons and three daughters and 
number eight child is coming he and 10yearold zalmai sat on 
their cart of sugar shielded from the cold rain by a tarpaulin of 
bright orange 
some days i am not eating lunch because if i eat lunch my 
family wont have food omar said 
no one in his family has been killed or wounded in the war but 
rockets fell near his house not long ago 
i am afraid of the rockets he said i made a sort of hole 
under my house when the rockets come i go with my family 
underground 
kabul has its pockets of affluence of fancy houses big cars 
lavish weddings glitzy sweaters and acidwashed jeans 
mohammad jamil who is 42 and has four children reckons he has 
a good job because he sells cars on commission rather than working 
for a salary but times are still bad 
five years ago we were selling and buying five or six cars a 
day he said just now we cant sell one car in a month 
in january he sold a 1983 mercedes benz to a rich merchant for 
7 million afghanis 14000 on the black market jamils 1 percent 
commission brought him 70000 afghanis 140 or 20000 more than

the chaotic development that is gobbling up the 
amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan 
developed by officials of amazon countries and leading scientists 
from around the world 
thats some of the most encouraging news about the amazon rain 
forest in recent years said thomas lovejoy a tropical ecologist 
at the smithsonian institution and an amazon specialist 
it contrasts markedly with a year ago when there was nothing 
to read about conservation in the amazon especially in brazil 
except bad news lovejoy said in a recent interview 
sixty percent of the amazon the worlds largest tropical rain 
forest lies in brazil but the forest also covers parts of eight 
surrounding countries 
lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in 
midjanuary in manaus brazil a sprawling city of 1 million people 
in the heart of the amazon it was the center of brazils 
oncethriving rubber trade 
the workshop which brought together all the governments and 
scientists with interests in the rain forest culminated with a 
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the amazon 
region 
it was the first time that all parties concerned with the amazon 
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation 
priorities the meetings participants said 
the plan devised at the workshop has no legal force but it has 
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for 
national conservation programs participants said 
many of the areas to be preserved will be open to socalled 
multipleuse development which preserves the forest while allowing 
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers fruits and 
medicinal plants 
brazil struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by 
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle 
ranching or farming has been ambivalent about the need to conserve 
the amazon 
brazil participated in the manaus workshop however and the 
setting of priorities was all done with the blessing of brazil 
lovejoy said 
tropical rain forests are giant living warehouses for thousands 
of plant andanimal species the amazon alone is home to 30 percent 
of the worlds plant and animal species 
one study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken 
from the deep shadows of the amazon floor contained 800 ants 
representing 50 species 
towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor 
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives 
without ever setting foot on the ground one group of orchid 
species grows only near the top of the canopy an entirely 
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom 
at the manaus meeting more than 100 specialists met in small 
groups to assess conservation priorities 
insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the 
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators 
mammologists took inventory of the amazons screeching monkeys 
ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats 
fallen fruits and nuts on the amazon rivers banks when it 
overflows botanists ornithologists and others did the same 
then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the 
amazon when they were done the areas determined to be worth 
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the amazon 
the bulk of the amazon is a biological priority theres no 
way of getting around that said russell mittermeier president 
of conservation international and an authority on endangered 
monkeys 
mittermeier emphasized however that the plan set realistic 
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves along 
with multipleuse areas where some development could occur 
it is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80 
percent of the amazon he said only the most critical areas should 
be placed off limits to development 
ten to 20 percent of the entire amazon should be in protected 
parks or preserves ideally he said at present 2 percent of 
the amazon is protected 
brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan 
the results of this meeting are a major contribution towards 
the work that has got to be done said stanley malone director 
of the suriname forest service 
suriname was one of eight amazon countries that agreed in 1978 
to develop a unified approach to management of the amazon malone 
said what the officials lacked however was a guide to which 
areas most needed protection 
that determination has now been made based on the number of 
different species a given area contained and on how many of those 
species were endemic or unique to the area 
now well have to see what develops from this mittermeier 
said a new brazilian president fernando collor de mello will be 
inaugurated march 15 and with him will come a new brazilian 
environmental policy 
whether the policy will include support for the manaus plan is 
uncertain as always everything depends on key individuals 
mittermeier said 
im basically always optimistic he said i feel sure that 
we can develop appropriate solutions although it may take a lot of 
work

no sign of forced entry at the home 
i dont want to have any suggestion that this is a 
murdersuicide because we dont know hastings said all we 
have is a family who has apparently met death by violent means we 
could have four murders

north carolinas 84 death row inmates wont 
go free but many of their lives could be spared under a us 
supreme court ruling overturning a key part of the states 
deathpenalty law authorities said 
the court monday set aside the death sentence of dock mckoy jr 
for the 1984 murder of a deputy sheriff because under the state 
law the sentencing jury couldnt consider any mitigating factor 
or one that might lessen the sentence unless all 12 jurors agreed 
writing for the court justice thurgood marshall said the 
unanimity requirement is unconstitutional chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor 
dissented in the 63 vote 
the opinion itself is just very sweeping said gordon 
widenhouse assistant appellate defender for the state were 
ecstatic 
the decision does not mean that any death row inmates will go 
free but it does mean that as many as 70 convicted murderers must 
have new sentencing hearings attorney general lacy thornburg 
said it means in each case that another jury will be required to 
again decide the appropriate punishment 
eightytwo men are on death row at central prison in raleigh and 
two women have been sentenced to die at the nc correctional 
institution for women also in raleigh said bill poston a state 
department of correction spokesman 
poston said officers at central prison gave word of the ruling 
to several of the inmates and asked them to spread the news poston 
said none of the inmates had expressed a reaction monday 
the state attorney generals office believes the ruling should 
affect only defendants who received death sentences beginning in 
1985 said jim coman senior deputy attorney general but im 
sure all the attorneys for all the death row inmates will appeal 
he said 
thornburg said he would ask the legislature to reexamine the 
death penalty law and make changes that will make the sentence of 
death more enforceable 
malcolm hunter jr the state appellate defender who challenged 
the north carolina law said he had not yet spoken with mckoy but 
he said he was not sure mckoy is really able to appreciate it 
hes over 70 in very poor mental emotional and physical 
health hes sort of a pathetic creature right now 
mckoy was convicted of shooting anson county deputy sheriff 
william kress horne three days before christmas 1984 
neighbors reported that mckoy was drinking and shooting and the 
sheriffs department responded once and asked him to stop when 
deputies were called to the house a second time deputies asked 
mckoy to step outside 
instead he opened a screen door and fired his gun shooting 
horne who was standing behind his patrol car with his pistol drawn 
at his trial mckoy had offered an insanity defense

the exxon valdez would have sunk in 
just over an hour if joseph hazelwood had moved it off a reef after 
it ran aground an expert witness said over defense protests the 
testimony was irrelevant 
lawyers for the skipper argued that the grounded tanker was 
immovable after it hit a reef last march 24 and there was no risk 
it would capsize 
superior court judge karl johnstone while indicating he agreed 
the tanker was solidly stuck allowed the testimony monday he said 
jurors had already heard too much about the skippers alleged 
efforts to move the ship to be told now to disregard it 
william vorus a professor of naval architecture at the 
university of michigan gave jurors an elaborate account of a 
computer simulation of the grounding as well as a scholarly 
dissertation on how a ship stays afloat 
the witness who said his engineering firm was being paid 
40000 by the state for its work on the prosecution calculated 
the exxon valdez would have capsized 75 minutes after grounding if 
it had been freed from the reef in 10 minutes 
hazelwood 43 is charged with criminal mischief reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil the seaman from huntington ny faces up to 7 
years in prison and 61000 in fines 
the exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude devastating the rich population of wildlife in prince 
william sound and coating hundreds of miles of rocky shore with 
black goo in the nations worst oil spill 
the most serious charge against hazelwood criminal mischief 
involves acting recklessly in disregarding a known risk 
deputy district attorney brent cole has focused on hazelwoods 
behavior after the grounding to prove this charge with witnesses 
saying the skipper ordered the engines turned on and the ship 
pointed forward 
but in a brief filed with the judge monday defense attorney 
dick madson argued that there was no risk that the ship would come 
off the reef or capsize and that hazelwood could not have 
disregarded a risk that didnt exist 
johnstone said testimony from prosecution witnesses has 
convinced him that the ship was hard aground on the reef and could 
not be moved off by its own power 
my inclination now is that physical impossibility is not 
evidence of the crime of criminal mischief the judge said in a 
hearing outside the jurys presence he said he would make a final 
ruling later 
but he refused to block prosecution testimony on the issue after 
cole argued that hazelwoods actions could relate to whether his 
judgment was impaired by alcohol 
the alaska statute covering criminal mischief says that a person 
may act recklessly if he is unaware of a risk because of 
intoxication cole did not explain how that provision would operate 
if no risk was involved 
defense attorney michael chalos objected that vorus testimony 
was sheer speculation but the judge overruled him

percent for sayner businessman gene ahlborn with all precincts

earlier holperin said the voter turnout would be critical the 
recall election was brought by opponents of spearfishing rights for 
wisconsins chippewa indians 
i am very pleased with the outcome it is not a foregone 
conclusion that this is a guarantee of victory in april holperin

election victory saying it only showed voters want him on the 
ballot next month and believed in the normal cycle of elections 
rather than recalls 
the recall was sparked by critics of indian spearfishing a 
right federal courts have said the states six chippewa bands 
retained in 19thcentury treaties with the us government 
the issue has caused years of unrest uncertainty and tension in 
northern wisconsin between indians who want to exercise a legal 
right and nonindians who complain their livelihoods are being 
destroyed 
organizers of the recall said holperin a fourterm incumbent 
had lost touch with his constituents on the issue and had failed to 
help reach an agreement to end the dispute 
the city clerk in rhinelander the largest town in holperins 
district which encompasses vilas and oneida counties said about 
21 percent of the eligible voters had cast ballots by midafternoon

the recall has its roots in a 1983 federal court ruling that 
said wisconsins six chippewa bands retained the right to 
spearfish hunt cut timber and gather food on offreservation 
public lands under 19thcentury treaties that ceded northern 
wisconsin to the us government the ruling is under appeal 
vilas and oneida counties have been the scene of angry 
confrontations between nonindians and chippewa spearfishermen 
during tribal fishing seasons of recent years 
organizers of the recall were especially critical of holperins 
support last year for republican gov tommy g thompsons plan to 
lease the treaty rights of the lac du flambeau chippewa band for 10 
years 
the lac du flambeau would have received 50 million worth of 
cash and other aid in exchange for curtailing the exercise of 
treaty rights tribal members rejected the plan in a vote last fall

italian communists spurred by the collapse of 
communism in eastern europe want to set their party on a new course 
this week one their leader believes can ultimately unite italys 
fractured political left 
an 1100delegate extraordinary congress of the italian 
communist party meets wednesday through saturday in bologna to 
consider party leader achille occhettos proposal for a rebirth of 
the largest communist party in the west 
occhetto is calling for in effect creating a broad new party 
that will seek to unite italys leftist parties under a single 
umbrella and effectively challenge the dominant christian democrats 
the communists are italys secondlargest party but have been 
kept out of the national government for more than 42 years 
despite bitter opposition from the partys old guard occhettos 
plan seems to have the support of about 67 percent of the 
delegates thats more than enough votes to assure him success and 
perhaps lead the party to adopt a new name and drop the hammer and 
sickle from its symbol 
in november just days after the berlin wall crumbled occhetto 
stunned italian communists when without consulting other party 
leaders he suggested the party change its name and set out on a 
new street to unify the forces of progress 
the partys central committee instead of adopting his proposal 
called for the extraordinary congress and decided to leave the 
decision to the delegates in bologna 
for occhetto the rebirth of the party is a gamble aimed at 
reversing its sagging political fortunes the christian democrats 
have led or dominated all italian governments since world war ii 
occhetto hopes a rebirth of the 14 millionmember party would 
move it closer to the ideas of the greens the radical party and 
liberal catholics thus creating a new political force 
divisions among leftists have caused the permanent victory of 
the christian democrats he said in november 
occhetto also would like that force eventually to include 
italys socialist party the countrys third largest 
but the socialists dont feel the same pressures they have been 
coalition partners with the christian democrats for the last decade 
socialist leader bettino craxi watching the steady electoral 
slide of the italian communists has campaigned to lead his party 
past the communists in the polls if he succeeds the socialists 
will become the second largest party and the de facto leader of the 
italian left

the largely rural chinese province of shandong 
has enacted new regulations requiring all job applicants to undergo 
tests for venereal disease an official newspaper reported today 
the regulations were drawn up after the coastal province 
recorded 2690 cases of vd in 1989 a more than fourfold increase 
over the previous year the china daily said 
authorities may now require all applicants for jobs in state or 
collectivelyrun enterprises to prove they are free of venereal 
diseases and can ask health centers to carry out vd tests on 
prostitutes criminals and vagrants 
couples will be allowed to marry only after proving they are 
vdfree the report said doctors may not give private treatment to 
vd patients without the authorization of local health offices 
the daily said the rise of extramarital sex was the main reason 
for the rapid spread of vd in the province 
china in 1964 announced it had eliminated vd from the country 
but has acknowledged that sexual diseases have made a strong 
comeback in the 1980s as a result of increased contact with the 
outside world a revival of prostitution and changing attitudes 
toward sex 
the nation has recorded more than 200000 cases of vd since the 
early 1980s with the southern provinces bordering hong kong 
chinas most open areas among the hardest hit 
but the spread of vd is also being taken seriously in more 
remote areas such as shandong which has relatively few direct 
contacts with the outside world 
the national government now requires all foreigners taking up 
residency in china to show proof they are free from vd and aids 
chinese returning from three months or more abroad must also show 
documents they are not infected by the diseases

to the roar of rock music and the glare of 
spotlights the worlds top windsurfers have moved indoors to prove 
they no longer depend on natures breezes switch on the fans and 
off they go 
combining theatrical glitz engineering wizardry and highlevel 
sporting skills organizers lured 10000 spectators monday night 
at more than 20 a head to watch the worlds first indoor 
windsurfing competition on a miniature ocean in paris largest 
sports arena 
the sideboards and concrete flooring that normally contain the 
ice skating rink at bercy arena were lined with a bright blue 
plastic sheet and filled with 555 million gallons of water 
twenty massive circular fans weighing a ton each were placed 
along one side of the basin producing a wind of more than 20 knots 
that kept two large flags in the facing grandstands flapping 
vigorously 
the basin was 230 feet long 98 feet wide and only 27 inches 
deep judo mats under the lining cushioned the windsurfers when 
they fell which was often 
the competition to conclude tonight includes both slalom races 
and a jumping event using a ramp equipped with plastic rollers to 
allow smooth passage for the boards 
american star robby niash recipient of the loudest cheers 
during the introductions had said following an afternoon practice 
session that the jumping would be a bad joke because the 
competitors had only a small fraction of the usual space they need 
to pick up speed 
but niash looked happier after easily winning his first slalom 
heat over three other racers two of whom promptly capsized when 
the race began with a slide down four sidebyside ramps 
the competitors 10 women and 24 men came from throughout 
western europe as well as canada australia and the united states 
plans for the event were first announced april 1 in a french 
windsurfing magazine and at the time roused suspicions that it was 
an april fools hoax 
but skeptics underestimated the persistence of chief organizer 
frederic beauchene whose earlier exploits included a windsurf 
across the english channel and later in tandem with a partner a 
transatlantic crossing 
beauchene began contemplating the idea of indoor windsurfing 
while running a weatherplagued world championship in france in 
1982 
we had enough wind only one day out of 10 he said the 
racers are frustrated the spectators also the sport is 
inconsiderate 
the indoor alternative not only solves the wind problem 
beauchene notes but facilitates television coverage and makes the 
sport accessible to people in inland cities such as paris he hopes 
the bercy competition will lead to a fullfledged international 
indoor circuit that would include west germany holland japan and 
the united states 
the germanmade fans were switched on twobytwo introduced by 
the master of ceremonies with almost as much fanfare as the racers 
marco lebaron the chief engineer had said earlier that the surge 
of power needed to switch all 20 fans on simultaneously could cause 
an explosion 
the volume of water in the basin is so vast that it cannot all 
be pumped directly into the nearby seine river in time for a horse 
jumping show at bercy on wednesday instead the water will be 
allowed to flood several basement rooms then removed gradually 
whether indoor windsurfing turns out to be a transitory gimmick 
or a legitimate boost for an exciting but not widely followed 
sport only time will tell but it certainly poses new challenges 
for the competitors 
a french sports magazine le sport quoted one unidentified 
racer as saying this would be the first time he would be able to 
hear boos if he did badly

iustinian dondera looked over his 
wares five bars of soap three videocassettes two bags of coffee 
and a toy car and contemplated the joys of capitalism 
there are many more people selling and better products he 
said gesturing to vendors hunched over car hoods spread with goods 
this is really business he added grinning 
dondera was one of hundreds of people selling blue jeans 
ladies underwear deodorant and other impossibletofind items at 
a weekend flea market on the edge of bucharest 
it is one of three weekly flea markets that have sprung to life 
in the capital in recent weeks and the most obvious sign of free 
enterprise to emerge since the december overthrow of dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
before the police would confiscate everything added 
donderas companion who identified himself only as dan now they 
dont do that 
in the ghencea neighborhood on the outskirts of bucharest the 
government charges vendors 13 lei the equivalent of 65 cents to 
set up a stand in the old dirt market area but hundreds of other 
people set up shop outside the market gates without paying choking 
a milelong stretch of road 
on car hoods or on blankets on the ground sellers lay out us 
cigarettes john travolta record albums bulgarian chocolates and 
car parts 
one young man offered labels with the names of italian 
designers to give clothes more value he explained 
the stalls were jammed by thousands of romanians who must 
normally wait in long lines for the few consumer items available in 
shops 
gabriel toma 22 stood patiently as his girlfriend held up 
bluejean skirts from a selection on a car trunk 
we dont find things in the stores so we are here he said 
but its more expensive than it should be of course and the 
quality is not always right 
nonetheless he held up a prize a box of a dozen colors of eye 
shadow a rare find in bucharest shops 
some vendors sold their old clothes or books others confessed 
to having developed private channels to get the imported goods long 
denied romanians under ceausescus exportdriven plans to pay off 
the countrys foreign debt 
mircea a young man in a black sweater and red silky 
sweatpants explained that he had driven to turkey to buy blue 
jeans which he was now selling for 1200 lei about 60 a pair 
out of his trunk 
he said he and his partner earned a profit of 15 a pair 
i must live he said in the factory i earn 2500 lei 
125 a month thats nothing 
down the road 27yearold manuela brenner was ordering a 
potential customer to smell the hungarian soap she was selling from 
a cardboard stand 
you wont find that in the stores her husband radu advised 
the customer the couple said they had driven to western romania 
near the hungarian border to find toiletries they could sell to 
supplement their incomes 
if you only knew how i got hold of them it was very 
difficult mrs brenner admonished the customer as he tried to 
negotiate a lower price 
she told a reporter that people were adapting quickly to being 
merchants even though they had lived in a highly centralized 
economy for four decades 
romanians have the idea of business in their blood she 
beamed 
recently the centralized economic system has begun to crack 
the ruling provisional council of national unity decreed last month 
that private businesses could be established with up to 20 
employees 
the government has declared that it intends to introduce more 
market forces to turn around a ravaged economy however major 
measures are not expected before may elections 
but at sundays market capitalism was settling in well with 
vendors as excited as buyers 
one man worked his way through the swarms of buyers thrusting a 
single black lace bra into womens faces 
only 150 lei he declared about 7 
another man waved a yellow polyester blouse 
onehundredpercent cotton he yelled no 1000percent 
cotton 
brenner interrupted a reporter trying to question the customer 
examining the hungarian soap 
business first he said briskly time is money

the congressional budget office says next 
years deficit will be twice what president bush is estimating but 
the red ink will go down sharply in the next few years if congress 
adopts all of the presidents proposals 
a new report by the cbo a nonpartisan agency predicts the 
deficit for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 will be about 131 
billion under bushs plan nearly 70 billion more than the white 
house predicts 
the administration budget is too optimistic in its forecast of 
economic conditions and interest rates and it fails to include a 
shortterm cash infusion needed for the cleanup of the savings and 
loan industry next year the cbo said 
as a result of the sampl costs the congressional agency estimated 
monday that the fiscal 1991 deficit will be 161 billion if no 
deficitcutting action is taken up from 138 billion it estimated 
in january 
the white house said its program would reduce the deficit to 
about 61 billion far less than the cbos 131 billion but that 
is based on its estimate of a deficit of only about 100 billion 
before deficitcutting action is taken 
the administration in its budget submitted in january did not 
include additional costs for the thrift buyouts 
barbara clay spokeswoman for the presidents office of 
management and budget said that cost would be factored into the 
administrations midyear budget update in july but omb might not 
agree with the 26 billion additional cost estimate of the cbo she 
said 
the cbo said its estimate of the deficitreduction value of 
bushs budget was about 31 billion some 6 billion less than 
claimed by the white house one big difference is that the cbo 
estimates the presidents tax increase proposals are worth 94 
billion compared with 157 billion in the administration estimate 
cbo director robert reischauer said the 31 billion in deficit 
reduction would put the government on a path toward a balanced 
budget even if not as quickly as bush claims 
by historical standards that is a great deal more than we 
have achieved in recent years he said 
the cbo projects the budget will be near balance by fiscal 1995 
two years later than the administrations forecast if bushs 
program is adopted 
under the grammrudman law congress and the administration are 
required to reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991 to 64 billion or 
less the administration produces the estimates that determine 
whether that target is met the cbo estimates are advisory

if you really want to know that your 
cheeseburger contains 711 calories and theres chicken skin in your 
mcnugget it may soon be easier to find out 
fastfood companies are under pressure from a consumer group 
insisting that four large chains honor a 1986 nutrition disclosure 
agreement 
consumers need to know that mcdonalds and burger king fry their 
potatoes in beef fat says michael jacobson executive director of 
the center for science in the public interest 
they need to know that mcdonalds chicken mcnuggets contain 
groundup chicken skin that burger kings whopper with cheese 
contains 711 calories and that milkshakes often contain artificial 
colorings said jacobson whose group is enlisting help from 
officials in three states 
this is the first complaint that weve received burger king 
spokeswoman cori zywotow said after learning that product 
information brochures were available at only six of 14 outlets 
surveyed by the washingtonbased center 
we certainly believe our consumers should know what theyre 
eating she added we provide guides to all of our restaurants 
we certainly will go back and take a look ourselves and if they 
are not being given out remedy the situation 
the center a nonprofit health advocacy group with 200000 
members outlined its complaints on monday against burger king 
mcdonalds wendys and kentucky fried chicken 
in letters to the attorneys general of california new york and 
texas jacobson said the chains are violating a 1986 agreement to 
give customers onthespot information about ingredients and 
nutrition and make sure customers know the booklets are available 
the agreement worked out with the three state officials was 
supposed to apply to outlets nationwide according to the center 
we are sorry to report that after initial compliance the 
voluntary program has broken down jacobson said in the letter 
based on a survey of eight states and the district of columbia he 
said only jack in the box appears to be honoring the agreement 
jacobson urged the attorneys general to consider prosecuting the 
companies if they dont fully comply within 60 days 
the four chains have been invited to meet with texas attorney 
general jim mattox and talk about the problem 
we want them to continue providing nutritional information 
said mattox spokesman ron dusek whether or not the states would 
be inclined to sue over the violations of this agreement i dont 
know 
we are dismayed that the fast food companies have chosen to 
drop this policy and wed like to see it returned said leslie 
gersing a spokeswoman for new york attorney general robert abrams 
but she added this is something wed like to do without having 
to resort to legislation 
denny lynch a spokesman for wendys said the company has not 
discontinued a policy of offering menu information although none 
was available at any of the 14 outlets surveyed by the center 
they might have run out of them lynch said thats easily 
fixed well just remind our restaurant operators that the 
ingredient and nutrition brochures are available and ask them to 
have a supply on hand 
only three of 13 kentucky fried chicken outlets in the survey 
had nutrition pamphlets on hand spokesman dick detwiler said that 
was because a new updated booklet was being published at the time 
of the survey he said the pamphlet has been distributed to 
companyowned stores and those franchises that want to provide it 
terri capatosto a spokeswoman for mcdonalds said her company 
never agreed to anything except a oneyear distribution of 
nutrition information in new york in 1986 
however she said mcdonalds current national policy is to have 
complete product information available and booklets are sent to 
restaurants regularly the center found brochures available at 
eight of 18 outlets and concluded that the policy is being 
ignored by many of their stores 
the consumer group reached its conclusions after surveying 
restaurants in virginia louisiana ohio wyoming new mexico 
texas california and new york in addition to washington dc

it is time for the united states to begin 
providing direct aid to the soviet union to encourage political and 
economic change and to abandon president bushs timid posture 
house democratic leader richard gephardt said today 
america must think creatively and act boldly the 1988 
presidential candidate said in a speech prepared for a meeting of 
the liberal center for national policy 
we should be investing in our own selfinterest and 
stability democracy and a market economy in the soviet union are 
in americas strong selfinterest he said 
the proposal seemed certain to spark debate on capitol hill 
where lawmakers have been pressing for increased aid to other 
countries emerging from the shadow of moscows domination but have 
not ventured to propose immediate direct aid to the soviet union 
itself 
gephardt dmo proposed starting with a food for freedom 
program to send us food aid to the soviets 
the united states also should waive trade restrictions with 
moscow including those on hightechnology exports and provide 
guarantees for businesses that want to invest in the soviet union 
he said 
gephardt noted an appeal by president vaclav havel of 
czechoslovakia made in a feb 21 speech to congress to help his 
country by helping the soviet union continue on its reformist road 
if havel who was imprisoned by the communists can call for aid 
to the soviets the least we can do is listen gephardt said in 
a speech that also contained his harshest criticism to date of 
bushs policy toward eastern europe 
a stronger soviet economy will facilitate the process of 
peace said gephardt how can the soviets pull red army troops 
out of eastern europe if they have no jobs and no homes for them to 
return to in russia 
direct us aid is possible now because the cold war as we 
have known it for four decades is over gephardt said while the 
possibility remains that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
could be ousted or his reforms could fail superpower competition 
in arms and influence has changed in fundamental ways he said 
the united states since may 1985 has sold 20 million metric tons 
of usgrown wheat to the soviet union under subsidies worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars but has never provided direct aid 
of the kind gephardt proposed 
the bush administration in its budget for the year that begins 
oct 1 has proposed an additional 300 million in unspecified aid 
to emerging east european democracies gephardt said the amount 
should be at least 500 million and that is only the beginning 
if we have the fortitude and the determination to seize the 
day he said we can ensure that the days of the cold war will 
never return 
but he accused bush of a lack of leadership in this most 
crucial moment throwing billions into the military budget to 
defend against communists who dont want to be communists any 
more while ignoring their economic needs 
its as though george bushs pentagon budget were written by 
someone who hadnt read a newspaper in a year gephardt said 
most of the administrations budget was drafted last year after 
the opening of the berlin wall but before many of the other 
dramatic developments in eastern europe 
i believe the answer lies in the presidents lack of vision 
gephardt said americans seem reluctant to provide aid to eastern 
europe because their president is not leading them he said 
he is not helping them understand the new world we live in its 
challenges its opportunities its dangers 
gephardt added his timid posture may well create a 
selffulfilling prophecy that at best confirms the status quo and 
at worst condemns the fragile new democracies to failure

john poindexters low public profile compared 
with that of oliver north is making it a relatively simple task to 
select a jury for the former national security advisers 
irancontra trial 
seventeen women and four men were sent into a pool of 
prospective jurors in the first day of jury selection monday only 
six people were disqualified largely because they had too much 
familiarity with the irancontra scandal 
at norths trial last year it took more than a week to select a 
jury primarily because so many prospective jurors had been exposed 
to norths televised testimony to congress in which the former 
white house aide admitted many of the activities that eventually 
led to criminal charges against him 
like north poindexter gave public testimony to congress under a 
grant of immunity but some prospective jurors could not recognize 
him in the courtroom monday 
hes the handsome man here with the glasses and moustache 
defense attorney richard beckler told a potential juror at one 
point beckoning toward his client seated across the room 
us district judge harold greene took care of the problem of 
exposure to poindexters immunized testimony before jury selection 
began the judge excused 76 potential jurors who said on a 
questionnaire that they had been exposed to poindexters testimony 
those 76 came from a total of 206 potential jurors in the north 
case all but 16 of the first 54 potential jurors indicated they 
had some familiarity with norths testimony on capitol hill 
twelve jurors and six alternates will be drawn for the 
poindexter trial from a pool of at least 40 
greene included in the jury pool a former bush campaign aide who 
years ago had been babysat by one of poindexters attorneys 
just because counsel babysat for her doesnt cast any doubt on 
her the judge said 
among the six who were disqualified was a food and drug 
administration employee who said he had heard that norths 
secretary fawn hall shredded documents in the scandal hall is 
expected to testify at poindexters trial 
if someone is shredding documents they dont want me to know 
about it said the man if they dont want me to know about it 
i want to know why they are shredding 
others sent into the jury pool include a postal employee who 
recalled poindexters name from norths trial last year a retired 
police officer who said he would treat former president reagans 
testimony the same as that of any other witness and a registered 
nurse who said she understood poindexter had been indicted on 
charges of defrauding the government in connection with arms sales 
poindexter actually is under indictment on charges of 
conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of 
making false statements the charges relate to poindexters alleged 
coverup of norths secret resupply network to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua and to poindexters alleged lies concerning a november 
1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran 
reagan gave videotaped testimony for poindexters trial feb 
1617 and poindexters lawyers are expected to replay it in court

president bush is offering assurances that he 
is not adopting a new policy that would rule out jewish residents 
in the eastern half of jerusalem a us jewish leader says 
seymour reich a new york lawyer who is president of bnai 
brith and head of the conference of american jewish organizations 
said monday night that bush did acknowledge that it might have 
been unfortunate for him to have referred to east jerusalem in the 
same reference to settlers on the west bank at a news conference 
last saturday 
reich spoke with bush by telephone for 25 minutes on monday 
afterward the white house issued a statement urging american 
jewish leaders to help promote a preelection dialogue between 
israelis and palestinians as soon as possible 
this remains the surest path available to promoting a peace 
that would ensure israeli security and the legitimate political 
rights of palestinians white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
members of reichs conference were disturbed by bushs comment 
saturday that we do not believe there should be new settlements 
in the west bank or in east jerusalem 
reich interviewed by telephone said any suggestion that 
east jerusalem can be compared with settlements in the west bank 
was very disturbing the word settlement had never before 
been used in connection with jerusalem he said 
the west bank and east jerusalem were captured from jordan in 
the 1967 arabisraeli war east jerusalem has been united with the 
rest of the city which israel made its capital but the west bank 
has been administered separately with jordan paying the salaries 
of local government employees there until 1988 
there are no settlements in jerusalem prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said sunday though 120000 jews now live there 
negotiations on the status of the west bank and the gaza strip 
captured from egypt in 1967 between israel and palestinians have 
been a longtime aim of us policy 
the white house statement said bush also reiterated that us 
policy toward jerusalem is unchanged with the united states 
supporting a united jerusalem whose final status is determined by 
negotiations 
reich called attention to the next sentence in the white house 
statement 
the president also made clear the us support for jews as 
well as others to live there in the context of a negotiated 
settlement 
the implication is that east jerusalem is different from 
settlements in the west bank said reich 
the united states has long opposed israels policy of settling 
jewish families in the west bank 
fitzwater said the united states would oppose any efforts to 
frustrate the right of soviet jews to move to israel 
bush indicated again that the united states will back a 400 
million loan guarantee for housing the soviet refugees provided 
the united states and israel can work out assurances that satisfy 
the united states on settlement activity fitzwater said 
the united states has said it will not help out if the israeli 
government settles immigrants from the soviet union in the west 
bank 
shamir and his governing likud party have been divided over 
whether to accept the us proposal for peace talks between 
israelis and palestinians 
the likud ministers in the israeli cabinet gave conditional 
approval monday to going ahead the chief condition was that the 
positions of the likud and its political rival and coalition 
partner the labor party be coordinated in any talks with 
palestinians in cairo 
a new complication arose when palestinian leaders in the 
occupied territories said monday no one would serve on a delegation 
to negotiate with israel unless the palestine liberation 
organization chose the delegation israel refuses to deal with the 
plo on the grounds that it is a terrorist organization bent on the 
destruction of israel

the us ambassador to guatemala is in 
washington called back temporarily to signal us dismay with the 
governments failure to stop a mounting wave of political killings 
ambassador tom stroock arrived monday for one week of 
consultations with secretary of state james a baker iii and other 
officials when he returns to guatemala city he will be carrying a 
message to president vinicio cerezo said state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
we are highlighting today by what i believe is a very 
strong forthright statement of us concern with the stalled 
investigations of the killings many of which were directed at 
leftwing activists she said 
we believe that these investigations should be given the 
highest priority and that all investigativetype resources should 
be directed toward bringing to justice those individuals who are 
guilty ms tutwiler added 
the fbi has sent forensic experts to guatemala to help in the 
investigations 
while the united states has provided substantial assistance to 
increase the investigative capacity of the police and the judicial 
system the perpetrators have still not been subjected to the 
rule of law ms tutwiler said 
given this situation the secretary of state has requested 
that ambassador stroock return to the united states to review the 
situation 
guatemalan government spokeswoman claudia arenas bianchi said in 
a telephone interview in guatemala city there is no temporary 
withdrawal of ambassador stroock he only left for meetings at the 
department of state 
cerezo and his christian democrats blame a rightist campaign to 
destabilize the government including two coup attempts last year 
by army officers but foreign diplomats and government critics 
blame cerezo for incompetence and say he is paralyzed by fear of 
rightwing violence 
the united states wants an investigation into last summers 
killings of five university students and several leftwing 
activists including one american 
many of the 77 politically motivated killings listed by human 
rights groups since last summer have been attributed to rightwing 
activists some foreign diplomats say the methods in some of the 
killings point to involvement by state security forces 
but ms tutwiler said the united states does not know who is 
responsible 
guatemalas democracy continues to be challenged by acts of 
terrorism and human rights abuses perpetrated by extremists who 
seek to undermine the democratically elected civilian government 
the spokeswoman said 
the united states government condemns these acts in the 
strongest terms and reiterates its fundamental support for the 
government of guatemala and for the peaceful transition through 
open and free elections to a new civilian government next year 
she said 
the violence in guatemala has dimmed hopes that a working 
democracy can take root in the central american country 
guatemala returned to civilian government in 1986 after three 
decades of military rule in which an estimated 100000 people died 
and 40000 disappeared the countrys previous experience with 
democracy ended in 1954 with a ciabacked coup against reformist 
president jacobo arbenz 
the guatemalan people deserve nothing less than what so many 
other nations of the hemisphere have achieved an open democratic 
system in which the rule of law is enforced and the rights and 
liberties of all guatemalans are protected ms tutwiler said

many lenders will soon offer a new type of 
mortgage designed to appeal to home buyers who expect to move 
within seven years but want the security of a fixedrate mortgage 
in case they dont 
the loans called twostep mortgages are a cross between an 
adjustablerate loan where the rate can change every one three or 
five years and a traditional 30year mortgage where the interest 
rate does not change for the life of the loan 
in the first step of the new mortgage borrowers pay an interest 
rate up to threeeighths of a percentage point lower than on a 
30year fixedrate loan after seven years the rate is reset at 
225 to 25 percentage points higher than the rate on 10year 
treasury notes 
on a typical mortgage of 83000 home buyers currently would 
save 23 a month or 1932 over the first seven years however 
the rate for the remaining 23 years of the mortgage likely would be 
somewhat higher than on a new 30year loan taken out at 
readjustment time 
for instance if the rate on a 7yearold twostep loan were 
readjusted now it would be 1075 percent to 11 percent onehalf 
to threequarters of a percentage point higher than fixed 30year 
mortgages 
but in this case unlike a refinancing the borrower would pay 
no additional fees or charges at readjustment time 
the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae said 
it would begin buying twostep mortgages from a handful of lenders 
today it said it expected them to be widely available later in the 
spring 
its a mortgage designed for the 1990s said fannie mae 
president roger e birk in this mobile society homeowners move 
and therefore repay their mortgages about every seven years 
birk said twostep mortgages are aimed at military families 
people transferred regularly by corporations and firsttime home 
buyers who expect to buy a better home within seven years 
very clearly this is marketed at people who expect to move but 
want to be protected in case they dont fannie mae spokesman 
gene eisman said 
the loans likely will be particularly popular in california 
where people move frequently and home prices are among the highest 
in the nation eisman said 
fannie mae is a congressionally chartered but shareholder 
owned company that helps finance about one of every eight home 
mortgages in the nation it buys mortgages from lenders it 
packages some into securities for resale to investors and buys and 
holds others

hog producers are enjoying some relatively 
good times and further improvement may be on the way says an 
agriculture department analysis 
returns have been on the upswing since last summer and could 
rise further during the second quarter as hog prices approach their 
seasonal peak the departments economic research service said 
market prices of slaughter hogs may reach the middle to upper 
50s per hundredweight before the end of june the highest in 
nearly three years the agency said in the march issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine so far prices in the first 
quarter have mostly been in the high 40s 
on monday top barrows and gilts were quoted at 5050 to 51 
per 100 pounds with some heavier weights ranging down to 46 and 
47 
a relatively low rate of hog slaughter this spring is expected 
to support prices the report said based on the size of last 
falls pig crop secondquarter slaughter could be down 7 percent 
from a year earlier the smallest for the spring quarter since 
1987 
most hogs grow to market weights in five to seven months so 
pigs farrowed in the fall usually make up most of the marketings in 
the second quarter 
the reduced supply of market hogs this spring could create 
difficulties for the packing industry the report said last 
year while hog producers were paring herds pork packers were 
expanding their slaughter capacity 
consequently the spread between hog prices and fresh pork 
prices narrowed in 1989 and these packer margins will narrow 
further through the first half of this year 
looking at cattle the report said choicegrade steers at omaha 
quoted at 7650 to 77 on monday may continue in the upper 
70s per hundredweight through late winter but drop to the 
lowtomiddle 70s in the spring as fed cattle marketings rise 
from yearearlier levels 
analysts said choice retail beef prices set a record allcut 
mark of 274 per pound in december typically a month of low beef 
demand 
the retail price for choice beef will continue strong through 
the first quarter of 1990 despite beef price features in february 
the national meat month the report said 
meanwhile with outdoor cooking just around the corner broiler 
producers will probably boost production about 7 percent this year 
as a result wholesale and retail prices broiler prices will 
likely decline considerably this year the report said on an 
annual average wholesale prices may be in the range of 49 to 55 
cents per pound compared with 59 cents in 1989 
wholesale turkey prices have dropped since december and 
producer returns are currently below breakeven the report 
said however lower feed costs this year have compensated for 
some of the price weakness

nine of the top 10 foreign markets for us 
agricultural products spent more last year than they did in 1988

economic community 
japan the perennial leader imported 815 billion worth of 
us products in the fiscal year that ended last sept 30 up 12 
percent from 1988 
the eec followed at 654 billion down 13 percent from the 
previous year according to agexporter magazine

markets for us products japan canada mexico the soviet 
union iraq south korea and taiwan the report said 
overall 198889 exports were valued at 397 billion up 12 
percent from the previous year a number of factors contributed to 
the gain 
drought sharply reduced yields for most major bulk commodities 
in the united states and canada in 1988 which resulted in a 
drawdown in stocks and higher prices the report said 
in addition asian economic affluence and growing demand for 
westernstyle foods has pushed this region to the top spot as a 
market for us agricultural exports it added 
others in the top 10 included soviet union 319 billion up 
71 percent mexico 277 billion up 60 percent south korea 
245 billion up 9 percent canada 219 billion up 11 percent

the pentagon isnt getting much sympathy in 
the house for its request to avert an expected massive layoff of 
military personnel by taking 852 million from other accounts 
the defense department made the request after deciding last year 
not to ask president bush to exclude personnel from grammrudman 
budget cuts and after the administration chose not to seek an 
exemption as it had done previously 
but house armed services chairman les aspin dwis with the 
backing of house speaker thomas s foley dwash declined to 
bring the request up before his panel dooming the pentagons 
appeal 
such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the house and 
senate armed services committees and the house and senate 
appropriations panels 
this is a disaster about to happen vice adm jm boorda 
deputy chief of naval operations for manpower personnel and 
training told a senate armed services subcommittee 
boorda predicted that without the ability to transfer funds the 
navy will again be a hollow force youll have a navy that looks 
like 1979 and youll have it by september he said 
other personnel service chiefs said they will be forced to lay 
off people freeze promotions and take other drastic management 
steps if congress fails to give them the authority to move the 
funds the defense department has said it faces the dismissal of 
tens of thousands of men and women by october 
the bush administration could have exempted the military 
personnel accounts from the acrosstheboard cuts last week aspin 
said putting weapons before people was their decision and now 
theyre stuck with it 
on monday aspin indicated that he wont back down from his 
decision 
reprogramming is going to be a useful exercise aspin told 
army officials who appeared before his armed services panel 
democrats on the house committee warned army chief of staff gen 
carl vuono and army secretary michael pw stone that congress is 
looking at slashing 8 billion from bushs 292 billion fiscal 1991 
defense budget and they should draw up contingency plans for troop 
reductions 
earlier monday the assistant secretary of defense for force 
management and personnel told a senate subcommittee that the 
pentagon did not recommend to the president that military personnel 
be excluded from acrosstheboard cuts 
christopher jehn said the pentagon realized that excluding 
military personnel would have left the armed services with a full 
complement of people but not enough money to allow them to train 
and to exercise at the levels we thought appropriate 
the tradeoff was whether we should protect personnel accounts 
and wind up with what amounted to an imbalanced budget jehn told 
the senate armed services subcommittee on manpower and personnel 
questioned by sen john glenn dohio the panels chairman 
about the type of imbalances jehn said there would be extreme 
shortages of things like spare parts fuel to support flying hours 
and steaming hours 
we made the sacrifice of people for spare parts glenn 
interrupted 
we did not make the sacrifice of people jehn answered

president bush is convinced along with 
national pta president ann lynch and chrysler chairman lee iaccoca 
that parents hold the key to greater student achievement 
education is a national mission that must include parents 
bush told about 250 parent teacher association leaders who met at 
the white house for a briefing monday on the national education 
goals 
after all a school program wont kiss away the pain from an 
injured knee a school program wont calm the fears of a child 
about to get a first shot and a school program alone cannot 
instill a lifelong love of learning but parents can spark the 
flame of curiosity by reading to their children every night the 
president said 
before the white house meeting lynch released a survey showing 
that most parents are not getting involved in their childrens 
schools many parents are doing only half their job when it comes 
to getting a good education for their children she said 
im convinced if we get more adults dropping into the schools 
the kids will stop dropping out iacocca said in a message 
accompanying the survey 
the survey found that fewer than half of the parents about 44 
percent had visited their childrens schools to participate in a 
backtoschool night while 46 percent attended parentorganization 
meetings during fall 1989 
too many parents sit at home and complain about the schools 
without ever setting foot through the doors to find out how they 
can help said ms lynch 
the most common reasons for visiting schools included attending 
a scheduled parentteacher conference which 71 percent had 
attended or class or school program which 64 percent had attended 
the survey commissioned by newsweek inc for the national pta 
and chryslers dodge division was based on a national sample of 
parents in 538 households with children enrolled in kindergarten 
through 12th grade ninety percent of the children were in public 
school with 10 percent in either private or parochial schools 
dr ernest boyer president of the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching suggested that parents be given at least a 
day or two off from work with pay to consult with teachers and 
spend time with their child at school 
if society sees value in giving employees release time for 
jury duty and to vote surely allowing parents time to be engaged 
in the education of their children is in the public interest 
said boyer 
while the survey showed that parents school involvement often 
was low most parents said they were very active in their 
childrens education at home two of every three 69 percent said 
they discussed school topics with their children nearly every 
school day more than half 58 percent helped with homework at 
least two to three times a week and 52 percent read to or with 
their children at least once a week 
more than half 57 percent said their own role was extremely 
influential in their childrens learning however 53 percent of 
the parents surveyed were not involved in any kind of parent group 
many of those parents cited lack of time or work commitments 
among parents who are involved in parent groups a large 
majority are more likely to help with fund raising 80 percent and 
extracurricular events 72 percent than to volunteer in 
classrooms 52 percent or participate in curriculum or policy 
making 33 percent 
the survey was conducted by icr survey research group in media 
pa between dec 29 and jan 7 the margin of error is plus or 
minus 45 percentage points

the world bank biggest source of loans to the 
third world said today it is planning to double its lending on 
education to 15 billion a year 
bank president barber b conable announced the plan in a speech 
prepared for a weeklong world conference on education being held 
at jomtien a seaside resort in thailand copies of the speech were 
made available by world bank headquarters in washington 
conable estimated that 100 million third world children are not 
enrolled in school 
education is an indispensable segment of the bridge over 
which the poor can cross the gulf from misery to hope he said 
it is crucial to the empowerment of people 
the world bank owned by 152 countries lends more than 21 
billion a year conable said that since 1963 it has lent about 10 
billion for education more than 2 billion of it for basic 
education in 100 countries 
conable said that less than 50 cents of every 100 of 
international aid now goes to primary education 
clearly the donor community cannot expect to be an effective 
partner in the efforts which flow from this conference unless there 
is a dramatic change in aid flows to basic education he said

george washington could not tell a lie but 
he apparently could leave behind a whopping debt 
an ancestor of jacob dehaven who lent washington 450000 worth 
of gold and supplies in 1777 is looking for repayment of the loan 
with interest the bill comes to 1053 billion 
if i owed the government this money i would be expected to 
pay the principal interest and any penalties that might have been 
incurred said carolyn cokerham of san antonio 
ms cokerham is one of nearly 2000 living descendants of 
dehaven who made the loan to washington to help defeat the british 
in the revolutionary war 
after the war the government offered to repay dehavens loan in 
continentals the thenworthless currency of the fledging country 
but dehaven refused and later died penniless 
ms cokerham and his other descendants have tried unsuccessfully 
to get the money repaid throughout the years 
jo beth kloecker an attorney handling the case said the us 
claims court in washington last month dismissed the lawsuit because 
the debt is more than 6 years old she appealed to the us court 
of appeals 
ms cokerham claims her grandmother once had a contract signed 
by washington promising repayment and 6 percent interest compounded 
annually she said shed like to receive some money but she really 
wants her day in court 
i want the government to admit that this was a debt of honor 
made by a patriotic man she said i hope it will be addressed 
in my lifetime but it has been 213 years

secretary of state james a baker iii will 
attend independence ceremonies this month in namibia on an african 
trip that could thrust him into negotiations to dismantle racial 
segregation in south africa 
so far the state department is giving few details on what could 
turn out to be a nineday trip to a halfdozen countries 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler announced on monday only his stop 
in windhoek the capital of namibia 
but preparations were under way for possible visits to senegal 
zaire botswana zambia ivory coast and south africa where the 
white minority government last month ended a 30year ban on the 
african national congress and released black leader nelson mandela 
from prison 
baker is going to windhoek to join with other world leaders as 
the former south african colony gains independence and sam nujoma 
a former guerrilla leader who spent 30 years in exile is sworn in 
as president 
nujoma helped found the southwest africa peoples organization 
in 1960 and led it through a 23year bush war against south african 
rule of africas last colony 
while representing president bush at the ceremonies baker will 
have a chance to meet with south african president fw de klerk 
and mandela but he is unlikely to turn the occasion into a 
substantive session about dismantling apartheid in south africa 
said a us official who spoke on condition on anonymity 
rather the official told the associated press it is highly 
likely that baker would have those discussions in cape town and 
johannesburg south africa where he would meet with a wide range 
of government and opposition leaders 
the bush administration has praised de klerk for the steps he 
has taken toward racial reconciliation while urging him to move 
faster meanwhile us sanctions designed to punish south africa 
for apartheid remain in place 
spokeswoman tutwiler said the windhoek stop was the only one 
scheduled so far she said she did know when baker would leave 
washington or return home 
we dont know anything other than the announcement i just 
made she said it could be the only stop he makes it could be 
that other steps are added

the senate debate over cleaning up the 
nations air is moving from behind closed doors to the senate floor 
with consideration of compromise legislation that is endorsed by 
the white house 
as the bill representing the first tightening of federal 
airpollution laws in 13 years came up for discussions late 
monday it promptly came under attack as being too expensive and 
burdensome to industry 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
does not intend to see the legislation languish he called it the 
best package that could be fashioned in nearly three weeks of 
closeddoor talks with the bush administration 
were going to stay with this bill until we complete it 
sooner or later said mitchell he said congress has grappled 
with clean air legislation for a decade and rarely has there been 
legislation so thoroughly considered so long debated so much 
discussed 
the way for floor action was cleared last week when senate 
leaders and the white house agreed on curbs on toxic industrial 
chemicals released into the air smogcausing pollutants from 
automobiles and the compounds that cause acid rain 
its uncertain how long the debate over the compromise 
legislation might last sen bob dole rkan the minority leader 
last week urged mitchell to allow ample time for discussions and 
amendments that might be brought up 
after brief opening remarks by mitchell and several senators 
monday the discussions were recessed and were not expected to 
resume until later today 
but even before the revised legislation was brought to the 
floor the compromise came under attack from both critics who said 
it was too tough on industry and senators who called it too weak to 
clean the dirty skies over the nations cities 
sen steve symms ridaho who was the only member of the 
environment and public works committee to vote against an earlier 
version of the legislation last november said the compromise 
represented little improvement over the committee bill 
its the big long arm of the federal government intruding into 
the lives of the american people said symms im not sure we 
need this bill right now 
mitchell snapped back that symms has opposed every effort to 
improve the quality of americas air in the past 10 years 
at a news conference sen frank lautenberg dnj said the 
legislation fails to require the auto emission controls needed to 
clean the air in seriously polluted areas such as the major 
metropolitan areas of the northeast 
americans are choking on dirty air and the clean air bill 
coming to the senate floor just wont get the job done said 
lautenberg he promised to seek some changes to the bill in the 
coming days 
but the two floor managers of the bill sens max baucus 
dmont and john chafee rri said the bill represented a 
significant step forward in achieving cleaner air including new 
controls on sulfur dioxide emissions from power plant and other 
boilers a major precursor of acid rain 
among other provisions the bill calls for annual sulfur dioxide 
emissions to be cut by 10 million tons or a bit less than half by 
the year 2000 tougher auto tailpipe controls and new curbs on 
industrial pollution to reduce urban smog in urban areas and a 
requirement that industry use the best available technology to 
reduce toxic chemical releases 
while the legislation moves to floor debate in the senate a 
similar clean air bill remains in a house committee

here is a summary of the key provisions of the 
compromise clean air bill being considered by the senate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
local communities must attain federal air quality standards 
within five 10 or 15 years depending on the severity of the 
problem the los angeles area is allowed 20 years 
areas must show annual progress ozone reductions of 4 percent 
a year for the first six years and 3 percent annually thereafter a 
waiver may be granted if the costs of the annual reductions exceed 
5000 per ton of ozoneforming pollutants 
reductions are to be attained through cuts in automobile 
emissions and smogcausing releases from industrial plants small 
business emitting less than 100 tons are exempt 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
automakers must reduce tailpipe emissions of smogcausing 
pollutants with all cars covered by new emission controls by 1995 
hydrocarbons unburned fuel would have to be cut by 22 percent 
to 025 grams per mile and nitrogen oxides by 60 percent to 04 
grams 
a second round of tailpipe controls would go into effect in 2003 
cutting emissions another 50 percent if 11 cities now with 
serious pollution problems fail to meet air quality standards 
cities with even more serious problems would have to use 
cleanerburning fuels such as methanol or specially formulated 
gasoline 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
utilities must reduce in two phases annual sulfur dioxide 
emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000 and cap emissions at 
1980 levels at that time first phase begins in 1995 but utilities 
using clean coal technology may delay initial compliance until 1997 
dirty plants primarily in the midwest also received extra 
pollution control allowances which may be sold to recoup some of 
control costs western states also receive additional bonus 
allowances to provide cushion for growth 
nitrogen oxide emissions by utilities must be reduced 4 million 
tons by year 2005 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
industry must install by 1997 the best available technology 
to reduce releases of 191 toxic chemicals by up to 90 percent 
the national academy of sciences will recommend methods for 
assessing remaining health risks especially from cancer the 
environmental protection agency must implement healthbased 
standards to deal with those risks after study is completed

college students prefer periodic tests 
or term papers to big final exams and learn more from teachers who 
give them substantial immediate feedback a harvard university 
study found 
for example a oneminute lowtech nocost technique is to 
ask students at the end of each class for a quick oneparagraph 
summary of what they learned said richard j light author of the 
threeyear study issued monday 
the study concludes that modest shifts in academic policies can 
create major improvements in college classrooms 
light a professor at harvards graduate school of education and 
kennedy school of government based the study on indepth 
interviews with 360 harvard undergraduates conducted by their 
fellow students and seminars that included faculty and 
administrators from harvard and about 20 other institutions 
among the conclusions of explorations with students and 
faculty about teaching learning and student life 
students said they learned the most in classes with periodic 
tests oral presentations and papers that let them know how they 
were doing midcourse rather than a big exam at the end of the 
course 
in particular students indicated they preferred opportunities 
to rewrite term papers after redpenciling by faculty 
students said they learned more from doing the fourth draft than 
by doing the first draft light said 
students found small study groups of up to six people meeting 
outside the classroom particularly effective light said teachers 
should encourage formation of such groups 
students in outside activities such as athletics or clubs jobs 
or volunteer work for up to 35 hours a week are by far the 
happiest students light said he said teachers should urge 
students to get involved 
while only harvard students were involved in the study light 
said the indepth questionnaires and the information from the 
seminars made the results applicable to other institutions 
including high school and graduate school 
light said he was surprised by some of the differences found 
between male and female students 
for example although there is no substantial difference between 
the grades of male and female students 39 percent of the females 
said they were not happy with their academic performance compared 
with 19 percent of men he said 
also although both groups indicated that study groups were 
effective males were more likely to join one or form one light 
said 
twelve undergraduate and graduate students were trained by light 
and other colleagues before they conducted interviews with the 360 
randomly selected harvard students they used a 23page 
questionnaire that included many openended questions followup 
interviews were done five to six months later 
r eugene rice senior fellow at the carnegie foundation for the 
advancement of teaching said the harvard study confirms a lot 
that we know about learning in fact just about human work in 
general the importance of feedback its regulation and its 
timing 
rice said he hoped that faculty heeds the studys 
recommendations but he noted that universities must then reward 
faculty for putting their time into this kind of teaching which 
take away time for work on research

nicaragua is shopping for international aid 
for its incoming democratic government and us officials say 
theyll have a proposal ready to send president bush within two 
weeks 
representatives of presidentelect violeta chamorro declaring 
their intention to seek aid from japan and western europe said 
monday the soviet union has agreed to continue the economic 
assistance it gave to the sandinista regime of president daniel 
ortega 
pedro chamorro son of the newly elected nicaraguan leader told 
reporters at the state department the soviets assure us that 
they are going to help nicaragua they are going to honor their 
commitments 
commenting after a meeting with secretary of state james a 
baker iii and other ranking officials chamorro said that while 
soviet arms are no longer needed or wanted continued imports of 
soviet oil are vital to nicaraguas recovery 
chamorro and other political and economic advisers to mrs 
chamorro plan further talks with government officials and with 
representatives of international lending institutions 
bernard aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican 
affairs said a package of recommendations will be sent to bush 
within the next two weeks spelling out what the united states can 
do to help 
the us economic embargo imposed against the sandinista regime 
likely will be lifted before mrs chamorros inauguration as 
president on april 25 aronson said 
a senior state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that to clear the way for us aid to nicaragua 
congress must agree to waive a law barring new assistance to a 
nation already in debt to the united states 
he said there will be concerns about setting a precedent but 
added i think there is a general recognition in both houses of 
congress and in both parties that nicaragua needs some immediate 
help 
chamorro and two other advisers to the new government alfredo 
cesar and francisco mayorga said no requests were made for a 
specific level of us aid dollar figures will be discussed later 
they said 
chamorro and mayargo said the situation is complicated by the 
fact that the sandinista government held economic data as a state 
secret as a result the full dimensions of nicaraguas needs may 
not be known for some time they said 
mayorga said however that hundreds of millions of dollars 
will be sought from all sources including the united states 
we expect the entire international community to contribute 
he said 
the bush administration made clear that it also expects 
substantial help for nicaragua from the international community 
including japan and europe 
the aid question is being worked on currently said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater we have optimism that the 
european allies as well as the soviet union and japan are willing 
to help 
mrs chamorros government which defeated ortega and his 
leftists at the polls on feb 25 will replace the sandinistas 
whose overthrow the united states was unable to accomplish with 
military support for contra rebels 
although the administration has pledged meaningful us aid 
levels for nicaragua the final scope of the assistance package 
likely will be dictated by budget constraints and the needs of 
other fledgling democracies emerging in eastern europe 
rep david obey dwis chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee that handles foreign aid told reporters there is a 
long line forming outside the door on that score we need to be 
cautious about the kind of direct financial investments we are 
going to be asked to make at a time when we have limited 
resources

the bush administration is pressuring japan to 
buy more american products or face the threat that festering 
frictions over japans huge trade surplus could result in us 
retaliatory actions 
us trade representative carla hills said monday the japanese 
risk having our market closed or at least gravely limited if 
they fail to dismantle their barriers to us goods 
she said president bush and japanese prime minister toshiki 
kaifu agreed during a weekend summit that there was considerable 
urgency in reducing americas 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
but at a congressional hearing monday two key senators 
expressed disappointment that the summit produced no trade 
breakthroughs administration witnesses were questioned closely on 
why there has been no progress despite six months of talks aimed at 
removing japanese trade barriers 
antijapanese sentiment in the united states is rising fast 
said sen max baucus dmont japan has a choice it can either 
follow the lead of the rest of the world and open its markets or it 
can keep its markets closed and have the rest of the world follow 
its lead 
in a pointed reference to the expanded retaliatory tools 
congress gave the administration two years ago sen john danforth 
rmo said if we didnt go far enough in 1988 believe me we 
can go further 
hills answering questions following a speech said there would 
be tremendous political pressure in the united states to 
retaliate if the kaifu government does not move promptly to attack 
the trade imbalance 
theres no question that japan has gained its economic 
wellbeing from worldwide trade and worldwide investment she 
said if it fails to open its markets to the same extent to our 
entrepreneurs they risk having our market closed or at least 
gravely limited and therein risk killing the goose that laid their 
golden egg as well as ours 
in tokyo kaifu defended his summit meeting with bush against 
critics who demanded to know what types of commitments kaifu had 
made in response to us pressure 
the united states is willing to have a dialogue with us do 
you really believe dialogue is bad kaifu asked during 
parliamentary debate 
the dispute between the two nations involves socalled 
structural impediment talks aimed at attacking economic 
shortcomings in both nations that have been blamed for the trade 
imbalance 
american negotiators have demanded that the japanese reform 
their distribution system to allow the sale of more imported goods 
and tighten enforcement of antimonopoly laws to prevent japanese 
companies from freezing out foreign firms 
following the twoday summit bush said the united states would 
do its part by reducing the federal budget deficit improving 
education and worker training and increasing savings and investment 
at mondays hearing by the senate finance subcommittee on trade 
undersecretary of state richard mccormack said us negotiators 
will be looking for significant progress at the fourth round of 
negotiations scheduled for april 23 in washington 
but administration officials conceded they have no assurance of 
any breakthrough either in april or before a final report is due in 
july 
the basic question is whether the japanese side sees this as a 
damage control exercise public relations or whether they see it 
as one requiring substantive effort said deputy us trade 
representative s linn williams on that point the jury is still 
out 
j michael farren the commerce departments undersecretary for 
trade said the us trade deficit which totaled 1086 billion 
last year has improved with japan by only 15 percent since 1987 
during the same period the us deficit with germany was cut in 
half and it was reduced by 29 percent with korea taiwan and other 
east asian countries 
there is an allbutexplicit underlying assumption that the 
japanese surplus must be maintained as a hedge against 
anticipated oil price increases farren said american workers 
will continue paying the insurance premium with the price being 
american jobs and a diminishing us standard of living

a former gynecologist accused of performing 
genital surgery on women without their knowledge to enhance their 
sexual responsiveness is suing cbs for 250 million over a west 
57th street broadcast 
cbs said it stands by the story on james c burt who alleged in 
the lawsuit filed monday in federal court that he was defamed by 
the program 
burt 68 faces about 50 malpractice suits for his 
selfdescribed love surgery in which he altered the genitals 
of his patients allegedly without their consent he said the 
surgery was designed to enhance their responsiveness 
burt sued over a 1988 broadcast of the news show that contained 
interviews with several former patients the program is no longer 
on the air 
the shows ludicrous and horrendous programming of the segment 
concerning the love doctor and his love surgery started a chain 
reaction of talk shows magazine articles media reports that have 
since totally destroyed my personal life my profession as 
physician loss of property loss of income my family burt said 
in a statement 
also named as defendants were two past or present cbs employees 
a patient and another doctor 
we believe the report was entirely fair and accurate and cbs 
news stands by it said cbs spokesman tom goodman 
in 1989 burt surrendered his medical license just days before a 
disciplinary hearing 
the board had charged that the surgery caused sexual 
dysfunction emotional distress infection chronic pain and the 
need for corrective surgery in some patients 
this has been the biggest hoax that tv has ever seen burt 
said i have never operated on anybody without informed consent

president mengistu haile mariam has 
declared a failure the marxist economic system he and fellow army 
officers imposed after overthrowing the late emperor haile selassie 
in 1974 
in a speech monday to the central committee of the ruling 
marxist workers party mengistu said he wants a return to 
capitalism 
the embattled president is fighting two bitter guerrilla wars 
simultaneously and facing cuts in aid from his principal 
benefactor the soviet union he appears to be wooing foreign 
investment 
the central committee must approve mengistus recommendations 
but there appeared to be little chance that it would not go along 
with his plans for a drastic overhaul of the countrys shattered 
economy 
in recent months mengistu has taken many small seemingly 
halfhearted steps to attract foreign investment and encourage 
domestic production but his speech monday appeared a near total 
capitulation to capitalism 
he conceded that economic central planning had been a failure 
among the specific reforms mengistu mentioned were 
allowing the private sector to take part in all sectors of the 
economy with no limit on capital investment ethiopia has had a 
250000 ceiling on all types of private investment 
giving governmentowned land on a concessional basis to 
private commercial firms for construction of industries hotels and 
a wide range of other enterprises 
allowing developers to build houses apartments and office 
buildings for rent or sale at present all land and commercial 
deeds are held by the government 
putting the governments myriad of stateowned industries and 
businesses on a profit basis with those continuing to lose money 
to be sold or closed 
giving peasant farmers legal ownership of the land they till 
and the right to sell their produce to private wholesale and retail 
outlets ownership of the land has been held by the state with 
purchase of crops handled by government marketing boards 
mengistu also told the central committee that ethiopias 
strategic red sea port of massawa has been paralyzed by renewed 
fighting between the government and the secessionist eritrean 
peoples liberation front 
he did not however acknowledge a rebel claim that the port had 
been captured 
the eritrean rebels have been fighting the government for 28 
years for independence for ethiopias northernmost province a 
former italian colony they launched a new offensive in february 
after an almost yearlong de facto ceasefire 
mengistu did say another major rebel group the tigre peoples 
liberation front had recaptured the vital garrison town of debre 
tabor cutting off government access to much of gondor province 
the town fell to the tigrean rebels shortly after they also 
ended a long ceasefire with an offensive in august the government 
managed to take it back in january but the rebels claimed to have 
captured it once again last month 
the tigrean rebels seek the overthrow of mengistu and the 
replacement of his government with one patterned after that of 
albania the last hardline stalinist regime in eastern europe 
in recent years ethiopia has been the soviet unions staunchest 
ally in africa the soviets however have been pressing mengistu 
to negotiate with rebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut 
soviet aid to ethiopia moscow sent 600 million in arms to 
ethiopia last year

cheating appears to be on the rise among 
college students according to researchers who say the trend may be 
a sign of todays make it mentality 
studies indicate about 20 percent to 30 percent of students 
cheat some copy from classmates work others plagiarize term 
papers or use crib sheets during exams while others take advantage 
of computer technology 
one student who was caught couldnt understand what hed done 
that was so wrong said arthur levine chairman of harvard 
universitys institute for educational management 
his argument amounted to everyone cheats and as long as i do 
it well i wont get caught and will succeed in society 
fortythree percent of 5000 professors nationwide responded 
yes when the carnegie foundation for the advancement of 
teaching asked are todays undergraduates more willing to cheat 
in order to get good grades 
perhaps the most discouraging side of the survey data is the 
portrait faculty paint of students both in the classroom and 
beyond the princetonbased foundations president ernest l 
boyer wrote on releasing the study in november 
getting ahead any way you know how is sometimes perceived as 
part of playing the game of survival college administrators said 
monday 
students read the newspaper and look at television and see 
plenty of examples of dishonesty in society said timothy f 
brooks dean of students at the university of delaware in newark

carlos kleiber conducted verdis otello at 
the metropolitan opera for the first time the audience heard 
something much different from the usual otello 
the emphasis monday was on the entire evening as one piece of 
music telling a story 
met audiences probably have never heard so much soft singing in 
otello arias werent done as set pieces that stopped at the 
end for applause understatement ruled and when a loud outburst 
came it was very dramatic 
placido domingo sang otello katia ricciarelli was desdemona and 
justino diaz was iago miss ricciarelli who hasnt been at the met 
since 1982 probably came off best singing softly she floated some 
lovely pianissimos her voice sounds right for the part secure but 
sweet 
domingo was splendid continuing to display more dept in his 
characterization and in his dramatic tenor the more he sings otello 
diaz has a wonderful tone and as a bass instead of a baritone 
iago can insinuate even more of that low evil sound as iago 
infects otello with jealousy with a boyish haircut and singing 
softly much of the time diaz took more a snakeinthegrass 
approach than rough or devilish one 
this production new in 1972 has always had iago carrying books 
hither and yon while singing his credo thats one aria wed 
like to have the singer stand and deliver 
on monday there were several solos instead of all choral 
singing when people bring flowers to desdemona in act 2 
and there have been changes in staging instead of climbing the 
stairs to their castle while singing love music with bright stars 
behind them at the end of act 1 otello and desdemona nestle down 
singing on the cyprus dock with only a few subdued stars 
this is a subtle and subdued reading of otello with dynamic 
range and great musical beauty

campbell soup co is recalling 24000 packages 
of its microwave chunky beef soup because it could contain harmful 
organisms 
the soup was made in the companys maxton nc facility and 
distributed to retail stores in indiana michigan ohio 
pennsylvania west virginia and wisconsin some of the 24000 
packages also were distributed to the military 
the soup was packaged in paper cartons each containing one 
9ounce microwavable plastic bowl with a metallized sealed 
lid an agriculture department announcement said monday the 
suspected product is identified by a threeline code stamped on the 
side panel of the package 
only packages with the code dec90 est4r co9j are being

the 15year director of the whitney museum of 
american art has been fired amid complaints about his leadership a 
proposed expansion project and exhibitions a scholar derided as 
contemporary schlock 
the boards dismissal monday of thomas n armstrong iii was 
announced by museum president william woodside 
woodside in a statement commended the director for having 
enlivened and invigorated the museum but said the board saw a 
need for new leadership appropriate to the changing climate 
facing private cultural institutions 
armstrong declined to comment monday 
his dismissal came after months of speculation that the board 
was dissatisfied with him 
his critics said the museum lacked direction under him and cited 
what they saw as trendy exhibitions his failure to hire a strong 
chief curator and his alienation of some donors 
woodside had asked armstrong to resign late last year but 
armstrong refused and sought support from board members art 
dealers and donors supporters praised him in a petition signed 
last week by more than 200 people 
some reports said he had made some antisemitic remarks but one 
board member robert w wilson told the new york times last month 
the alleged remarks were being excluded from any consideration of 
armstrongs future 
a scholar in american art told the times in december that the 
museum had exhibited too much contemporary schlock and too many 
superficial exhibitions of meaningful american artists the 
scholar declined to be identified 
another problem concerned a proposed 375 million addition that 
would double the museums size the plan unveiled in 1985 drew 
criticism because it proposed to wrap the new structure around the 
original museum which was designed by modernist architect marcel 
breuer the plans were revised 
woodside said a search committee will choose a new director

abortion and taxes are dividing 
republicans in a primary battle as the party desperately seeks to 
hold onto its last major political bastion in illinois the 
governors mansion 
the embattled frontrunner in the march 20 republican primary is 
secretary of state jim edgar a prochoice moderate who is the 
nearunanimous choice of the state gop hierarchy to succeed 
retiring fourterm gov james r thompson 
his chief opponent is steven baer a 30yearold conservative 
political organizer who is attacking edgar as a taxandspend 
liberal and proabortion extremist 
the contest has conservative stalwarts like phyllis schlafly and 
rep henry hyde rill in opposing camps and puts the national 
party in the position of backing a candidate whose stand on 
abortion and taxes bears little resemblance to its 1988 platform 
but many elected republicans and party leaders say victory is 
more important than ideology in this race 
we just cant afford to lose a governorship in a state like 
illinois in an offyear election said republican national 
chairman lee atwater its absolutely critical that we have the 
strongest candidate and thats jim edgar 
edgar 43 has been a rising star of the state gop for nearly a 
decade appointed by thompson in 1981 to fill a vacancy in the 
patronagerich secretary of states office he won reelection 
twice he seemed to have scared off potential gubernatorial 
opposition within his party last summer with a long list of 
endorsements and a campaign bankroll that now stands at 32 
million 
edgar declared that the state should make permanent a twoyear 
20 percent state income tax increase approved by the legislature in 
june he also bluntly stated his support for abortion rights 
including lifting the states neartotal ban on medicaidfunded 
abortions 
those stands brought to a boil the conservative discontent that 
had simmered under thompson a moderate who vetoed antiabortion 
legislation on constitutional grounds and spent much of his current 
term pushing for tax increases 
thompson was proabortion but he wasnt as upfront about it 
as edgar said mrs schlafly who is supporting baer edgar 
starts out his speech by saying hes proabortion 
baer pledges to be a governor who can read our presidents 
lips and oppose higher taxes he has put that message on 
thousands of videotapes mailed to grassroots republicans church 
groups and antiabortion activists 
baer argues that his antitax stance is an effective strategy 
against the likely democratic gubernatorial nominee attorney 
general neil hartigan who is prochoice but has taken a 
waitandsee stance on extension of the tax increase 
the republican party in illinois can have its cake and eat it 
too baer said we can win and still be able to sleep at 
night 
edgar said his views on abortion coincide with those of most 
illinoisans and added that his party should have learned a lesson 
from the victories of prochoice democrats in recent new jersey and 
virginia gubernatorial races 
he said he has moved to win broad support within his party by 
calling for curbs on government spending and assembling a 
conservatives for edgar committee headed by hyde who acknowledges 
that politics took precedence over philosophy in his endorsement 
with democrats likely to retain control of the legislature in 
the fall election the gubernatorial race is the gops best hope 
for gaining leverage in the legislative and congressional 
reapportionment that begins in 1991 
we dont control the legislature we dont control the mayors 
office in chicago we dont control a united states senate seat 
edgar said if we lose the governors office the republican 
party is going to be a very distinct minority in illinois

the rare ritual of exorcism practiced twice by 
the new york archdiocese in a year is cloaked in mystery even for 
those most familiar with it but priests say the movie the 
exorcist depicted it pretty well 
a lot of people think they know the answer but my experience 
is nobody really does said the rev john nicola a priest with 
the washington archdiocese who assisted at four exorcisms in rome 
from 1973 to 1975 
he added even psychiatrists who have no belief in the 
supernatural will tell you about cases 
catholic theologians expressed surprise monday that cardinal 
john j oconnor reported the two new york exorcisms he made the 
disclosure during a sunday sermon at st patricks cathedral in 
which he said diabolically instigated violence is on the rise 
the cardinal said the exorcisms were approved by the 
archdioceses vicar general and appeared to be successful but he 
gave no details he also said the novel the exorcist is a 
gruesomely authentic portrayal of demonic possession 
nicola agreed being there nicola said is quite scary 
typically said the rev james t burtchaell theology professor 
at notre dame university an exorcist must be a very 
selfpossessed consistently holy man to survive the experience 
it involves a great deal of selfabuse bodies being flung 
around the room excrement assumed voices its pretty vile 
stuff he said 
the darn movie is going to be the image everybody has but i 
must say events in the movie are very faithful to stories ive 
read about real exorcisms 
exorcisms are confidential no figures are kept on the number 
performed in the united states said bill ryan spokesman for the 
us catholic conference in washington 
but nicola estimated investigations result in only one exorcism 
every two years in this country in europe some dioceses might 
have five or 10 a year in parts of asia africa south america and 
mexico it might be an everyday thing 
pope john paul ii recently increased the number of exorcists in 
rome and in turin where there are a reported 40000 devil 
worshipers the san francisco chronicle reported in december 
the rev simon harak a catholic priest and theology professor 
at fairfield university in connecticut said the churchs book of 
rituals recognizes exorcisms for people who are no longer in 
charge of their own will 
exorcism existed before the time of christ and harak said it 
may gain prevalence in times or places of satanic worship 
in the gospels theres quite a bit of reference to jesus not 
only healing people of diseases but freeing them from diabolical 
possession said burtchaell ever since then there have been 
outbreaks of similar behavior 
besides the most radical form of exorcism there are ceremonies 
dealing with evil spirits including a baptismal prayer more 
common in the roman catholic church 
its not like oh my goodness william peter blattys the 
exorcist its a recognition that there are good spirits 
angels and bad spirits devils harak said

south african paratroopers 
attempted today to end massive rioting and looting in the ciskei 
homeland that left at least 20 people dead and more than 550 
injured in the wake of a military coup 
south african forces set up road blocks around the ciskei 
capital of bisho and sent out patrols as senior officers planned 
the deployment of more troops officials said there were no 
reports of any clashes involving south african forces but looting 
was continuing in some areas they said 
doctors at hospitals in ciskei and nearby east london in south 
africa said at least 20 people had been killed and more than 550 
injured in two days of rioting and looting they said most had 
suffered gunshot and stabbing wounds 
rioting erupted after the ciskei army ousted the nominally 
independent homelands authoritarian president in a bloodless coup 
sundays coup was widely acclaimed by most ciskeians who 
opposed the old government because of its authoritarian rule and 
repression of antiapartheid activists 
president lennox sebe 63 was on a trade mission in hong kong 
when the military seized power he had been in power since 1981 
the coup leaders said they favor returning ciskei to south 
africa many blacks accuse south africas white minority government 
of creating such homelands to try to restrict blacks to the most 
isolated and underdeveloped parts of the country 
ciskei a 3600squaremile territory of about one million 
people on the southeast coast is one of 10 black homelands none 
is recognized as sovereign by any country other than south africa 
the jubilation over the coup turned to horror monday when 
thousands of people began looting and burning stores and factories 
more than 50 factories many of them owned by israeli and taiwanese 
firms were burned as drunken mobs went on the rampage in several 
towns 
it was a drunken orgy of violence it looks like a war zone 
dozens of buildings were gutted said local journalist louise 
flanagan 
south africa sent in the troops at the request of brig gen 
oupa gqozo the coup leader and head of the new military 
government the ciskei army cheered by the rioters made no 
attempt to stop the lawlessness eyewitnesses said 
we didnt expect the jubilation of the people to turn into 
such turmoil but seeing that has happened we have asked for 
further reinforcements from south africa and they have responded 
positively gqozo told reporters 
south africa initially declined to intervene but sent troops 
into ciskei after angry crowds menaced government buildings in 
bisho 
protesters initially attacked and looted shops belonging to 
officials of the ousted ciskei government but the crowds began 
attacking all businesses and hundreds of buildings shops 
factories and vehicles were torched witnesses said 
rioters many of them drunk broke into shops removed goods 
then set buildings ablaze with firebombs the witnesses said 
looters used wheelbarrows to haul away stoves refrigerators and 
other items officials said 
foreignowned factories were burned because the old government 
attracted overseas investment by providing workers at wages of 50 
a month or less working conditions reportedly were very harsh 
gqozo received a rousing cheer monday when he told thousands of 
people at a stadium in bisho that the african national congress and 
other antiapartheid groups would be free to engage in political 
activity in ciskei 
the anc is the main black group fighting the south african 
government president fw de klerk legalized the anc last month 
but some homeland leaders do not allow the group to operate in the 
territories they control 
gqozo made the announcement following meetings monday with the 
ancaligned united democratic front 
south africa established the homelands in the 1960s in an 
attempt to create separate tribalbased states for blacks while 
whites would retain control of national politics and the economy 
gqozo said he would like to see ciskei relinquish its nominal 
independence and return to south africa the transkei homeland is 
considering a similar plan the south african government has not 
taken a position on homelands that want to return to south africa

the rev bruce ritter denied any wrongdoing in 
setting up a trust fund of nearly 1 million for runaways that also 
was used to make loans to two covenant house board members and 
ritters sister the new york times said today 
officials of covenant house built by ritter into the nations 
biggest network of shelters for runaways told the newspaper the 
loans from the taxexempt fund were made without the knowledge of 
most members of the board 
it was not known whether the loans were illegal the newspaper 
said that would depend partly on what information was provided to 
the internal revenue service and the state attorney general 
ritter who resigned last week as president of covenant house 
amid allegations of sexual misconduct involving young runaways 
confirmed the loans and said he did nothing wrong 
i thought i was doing a good thing to take care of the kids 
the roman catholic priest said 
ritter said he created the fund in 1983 out of his salary to 
support covenant house programs that the charity otherwise could 
not afford covenant house later made contributions directly to the 
fund the newspaper said 
the fund received taxexempt status in 1984 said edmund j 
burns its trustee 
it was my salary ritter said god help me i earned it 
seven days a week yearround 
two board members who benefited from trust loans james j 
maguire and dr james t kennedy recently resigned the times 
said 
maguire in 1988 borrowed 100000 which is still outstanding 
separately in 1986 maguire sold the trust five acres of 
undeveloped land for 80000 in 1989 the trust sold the land to 
kennedy for 120000 kennedy paid 30000 cash and the trust gave 
him a 10 percent mortgage on the balance the times said 
in another instance the trust made a 1987 loan of 131000 to 
ritters sister cassie wallace of trenton nj who was moving 
to north carolina and was having trouble selling her house the 
times said 
the next year she repaid 107781 and ritter himself paid the 
rest 23319 out of personal funds the times said the interest

prime minister toshiki kaifu today told parliament 
that land prices must be driven down and government spending 
increased if japan is to reduce its huge trade surplus with the 
united states 
low wages and expensive housing have kept japanese from buying 
more imports making it difficult to cut into the 49 billion 
surplus 
our corporations are wealthy and strong but this wealth has 
come at the expense of long working hours and a low standard of 
living it is time to redress this imbalance he said 
we intend realistic efforts to carry out structural reforms 
that means we must carry out reforms of our land use policies and 
improve the standard of living kaifu said during questioning by 
opposition legislators in the upper house of parliament 
kaifus opponents led by the socialists the no 1 opposition 
party dominate the upper house and are likely to obstruct action 
on a number of traderelated issues facing parliament 
these include plans to provide more land for housing and cut 
inflated real estate prices and to spend more on roads parks and 
sewers to improve the general quality of life 
washington says such changes are needed to eliminate 
structural trade barriers behind the chronic us trade deficit 
with japan 
a key barrier us officials have targeted is a law that they 
say tends to prevent foreign firms from expanding their sales in 
japan today trade ministry officials said they were considering 
changing or abolishing that law 
minister of international trade and industry kabun muto 
reversing himself on the issue told japanese reporters bolder 
steps might have to be taken if the united states is not satisfied 
with plans to ease the laws enforcement 
us trade negotiators contend it hinders foreign retailers who 
are trying to open stories in japan as well as discourages the 
opening of large japanese stores that are more likely to sell 
foreignmade goods than traditional momandpop shops 
kaifu promised president bush to do his best to carry out 
substantial reforms during a california summit last week but he is 
fighting his governments tendency to become bogged down in 
domestic disputes 
japans parliament was embroiled in battles over a bribery 
scandal and over a controversial sales tax and has accomplished few 
traderelated reforms during the past year 
parliament must first deal with a revised version of the 3 
percent sales tax and a national budget by the end of this month a 
revision of the sales tax exempting food school entrance fees and 
welfare in response to widespread criticism was scheduled to go 
before parliament today 
kaifu is urging japan socialist party chairwoman takako doi and 
other opposition leaders to abandon their attacks on the sales tax 
given the comfortable majority his party won in feb 18 
parliamentary elections 
opposition parties unsuccessfully based their campaigns in last 
months lower house election on calls to abolish the sales tax 
which along with a series of sex and money scandals eroded public 
support for the governing party and contributed to its loss of 
control of parliaments upper house in july elections 
while analysts are skeptical about kaifus chances of following 
through on his promises to bush the reforms are widely supported 
by major business organizations and the media 
joining other business groups the kansai economic federation in 
western japan urged the government monday to raise taxes on 
farmland in major cities to the same level as residential taxes to 
encourage development of suburban farmland 
it also called for measures to narrow the gap between prices in 
japan and overseas 
japanese officials however have expressed concern that kaifu 
who lacks clout in his own party will have problems gathering 
support for reforms soon enough to satisfy the united states 
tokyo is under pressure to show it will implement promised 
reforms before early april when trade negotiators are to issue an 
interim report on the usjapanese talks a final report is due in 
july 
also today a top japanese defense official said japan is ready 
to consider increasing funds for maintaining us forces in japan 
if such a request is officially made by the united states 
if the us side makes a request in concrete terms we will 
consider increasing expenses for us troops in japan yozo 
ishikawa director general of the defense agency told a news 
conference 
but ishikawa who assumed the agencys top post feb 28 said he 
has heard nothing official about the request yet 
ishikawa was referring to a statement by us defense secretary 
dick cheney during a television interview sunday that he wants 
japan to assume 100 percent of the cost of maintaining us 
military bases in japan 
japan is currently paying 24 billion of the 6 billion annual 
cost of maintaining us forces in japan a defense agency official 
said such costs include the salaries of the 22240 japanese 
employees at us miltary facilities across japan 
about 50000 us military personnel are based in japan and 
their salaries and other costs are not included in the maintainance 
equation

in cities of the slavic heartland voters 
supported prodemocracy candidates who promise accountability over 
communist bosses who have long controlled municipal machines 
through patronage activists said 
even in leningrad traditionally a bastion of hardline 
communists prodemocracy candidates dominated sundays local and 
republicwide elections said editor yelena velinksaya of the 
official youth news agency ima press 
most of the 1800 contests for seats in the legislatures of the 
russian federation the ukraine and byleorussia remained undecided 
and will have to be settled by runoffs expected in two weeks 
but unofficial returns suggested that progressives made 
substantial gains as voters rejected conservative communist 
candidates they associated with corruption and economic 
mismanagement 
advocates of democracy could secure control several major city 
councils 
heavy turnout appeared to favor reformers in the ukraine and 
byelorussia where 80 percent of registered voters went to the 
polls the communist party newspaper pravda said today 
the newspaper said however that only 64 percent of registered 
voters turned out in moscow capital of the huge russian 
federation turnout figures for the federation as a whole were not 
yet available 
reformer boris n yeltsin had no trouble winning a legislative 
seat in the russian federation taking 72 percent of the vote in 
his district of sverdlovsk in the ural mountains he defeated 11 
other candidates said anatoly moiseyev of the russian federation 
election commission 
yeltsin has said he will seek the presidency of the republic 
which traditionally means a place on the communist partys ruling 
politburo 
that could return the communist maverick to the membership he 
lost in february 1988 for advocating speedier change 
other reformers in the russian federation also appeared headed 
for victory as did leaders of nationalist movements in the ukraine 
and byelorussia an outspoken television commentator in leningrad 
and a defiant editor in moscow 
were so happy such success said irina rozhenko of the 
ukrainian prodemocracy movement narodny rukh 
activists said strong showings in this round nearly guaranteed 
victories in runoff elections for candidates who want to step up 
the pace of reforms begun by president mikhail s gorbachev 
in washington state department spokesman margaret tutweiler 
said monday that while for the most part these were not 
multiparty elections there were nonetheless many hotly 
contested competitive regional and local races offering voters a 
clear choice of candidates and ideologies 
this represents an important and indeed historic step 
forward in the process of democratization in the soviet union 
she said 
in fact the communist party is still the only legal political 
party in the soviet union despite its agreement last month to end 
its political monopoly and compete with other parties 
so proreform candidates either had to run as communists or on 
slates of grassroots movements 
defeat of old guard local communist leaders probably would help 
gorbachevs liberalization he has railed against functionaries who 
hamper reform and people hoping to exercise new economic freedoms 
have told of crippling obstacles erected by local party officials 
zyanon paznyak leader of the byelorussian peoples front got 
59 percent of the vote in his minsk district said spokesman victor 
ivashkevich 
he said activist candidates appeared to have carried cities but 
that party apparatchiks including byelorussian party chief yefrem 
sokolov won rural districts 
in leningrad bella kurkova controversial commentator from the 
public affairs program fifth wheel appeared to be the only 
firstround winner said ima press 
ms velinskaya said prodemocracy candidates dominated the 
elections in leningrad and that just two of about 150 candidates 
supported by the ultraright nationalist group pamyat survived the 
first round 
vladislav starkov editor of the countrys most popular 
newspaper arguments and facts was reported the winner of a seat 
to the russian republics parliament 
starkov ignored a strong suggestion from gorbachev that he quit 
last year after the paper printed results of a poll implying that 
the late human rights activist andrei d sakharov was more popular 
than gorbachev 
unofficial reports said wellknown dissident sergei kovalyov 
also won a seat in the russian parliament 
ukraine party chief vladimir a ivashko considered a moderate 
protege of gorbachev qualified for a runoff against an opponent 
backed by narodny rukh vitaly i vorotnikov president of the 
russian republic defeated a lone opponent in the city of 
krasnodar winning 713 percent of the votes cast 
both are politburo members 
narodny rukh members said the movements leader poet ivan 
drach was elected in the first round along with several other 
prominent activists 
official reports said 86 percent of the candidates in the 
russian elections and 80 percent in the ukraine were members of the 
communist party 
political tension has increased in some regions as direct 
control from the kremlin decreases in recent weeks gorbachev has 
prodded the communist party into giving up its monopoly on power 
and pressed for a new more powerful presidency 
in lithuania candidates of the proindependence sajudis 
movement swept earlier legislative elections and won more seats in 
runoffs sunday of the 25 candidates elected sunday 18 were from 
sajudis according to reports from activists and the official news 
agency tass 
some activists in the baltic republic want the legislature to 
vote on secession from the soviet union before gorbachev gets his 
new powers which would include the right to suspend the 
legislature of a republic and send in troops

homeless people seized and moved into 
federallyowned vacant houses in three cities threatening to stay 
until the government does more to provide affordable housing for 
the poor 
activists with the philadelphiabased union of the homeless on 
monday took over five houses in philadelphia and one each in 
alexandria va and detroit leaders said police in new york city 
thwarted an attempt there to move into a house 
ronald darnaby of the philadelphia union said the coalition 
checked with huds inventory to identify houses for sale then 
discussed the proposed seizures with community leaders 
the twostory homes would house two families each none of the 
houses had utilities darnaby said 
inside one of the houses protesters and homeless people wearing 
coats huddled around kerosene heaters and sipped hot drinks while 
about 20 other members picketed outside well stay as long as it 
takes said charles thompson 
craig gaskin a spokesman for the homeless union said the 
squatters would stay until their demands are met or they are 
removed by police 
the coordinator for the homeless for huds regional office in 
philadelphia pat mulligan said his agency considered the seizures 
trespassing but that officials had not decided how to respond 
city officials sent in building inspectors but no police 
officers lt ed kachigian said the city would not act against the 
homeless unless hud requested it 
in october hud secretary jack kemp said hud would take 10 
percent of its singlefamily inventory for affordable housing for 
homeless people but the union said it wants action immediately 
we are sick and tired of empty promises union president 
leona smith said the government is more committed to bailing out 
mismanaged savings and loans banks than to saving and restoring the 
lives of people who are homeless chronically unemployed and who 
are being pressed into a permanent underclass status 
the organization wants more money earmarked for remodeling or 
construction of lowincome housing and for rent subsidies 
in manhattan about 30 members of the union were thwarted by 
police in an attempt to take a house said union member renaldo 
casanova he said two members of the group were arrested 
casanova said mondays activities were a prelude to a may day 
event in which the union plans to have activists in 40 states 
simultaneously occupy vacant hudowned houses 
philadelphia housing commissioner ed schwartz offered to act as 
a mediator between the homeless and hud a role he played two years 
ago when the group seized several houses hud later sold those 
houses to the homeless group 
mulligan said the agency gives priority to shelter groups when 
selling houses and offers leases for 1 a year

stiff desert winds slowed 
efforts to prepare space shuttle atlantis for a piggyback jet ride 
back to florida 
gusts to 45 mph also delayed an investigation into an apparent 
leak of hydraulic fluid discovered before the shuttle landed here 
sunday from a secret 4day mission during which it put a 500 
million spy satellite in orbit 
as far as the landing it was not a safety issue conrad 
nagel atlantis processing director for nasa said of the leak 
meanwhile discovery was towed monday to an assembly building at 
kennedy space center in florida nasa spokeswoman pat phillips said 
inside booster rockets and the external fuel tank will be 
attached to discovery which is scheduled for launch april 12 on a 
mission to put the 155 billion hubble space telescope in orbit 
atlantis was towed off its dry lakebed landing strip and into a 
100foot steel maintenance structure but the wind prevented nasa 
from hoisting the shuttle as planned monday morning slowing work 
by about 16 hours nagel said 
nagel said the delay forced officials to postpone the trip atop 
a modified boeing 747 to florida from friday to saturday 
the possible leak of bright red hydraulic fluid was discovered 
as atlantis approached landing sensors showed a brief pressure 
drop in the main hydraulic system 
the system operates control surfaces that steer the spacecraft 
under computer orders during reentry nagel said 
overall he said the shuttle was in excellent condition only 
one heatshield tile may need replacement about 20 other tiles 
sustained dings up to an inch in size while about 40 others 
had nicks of a half inch or less 
atlantis is scheduled to fly again july 9 on another secret 
mission

chancellor helmut kohl has agreed to 
formally state support for a treaty on polands western border 
without asking for concessions from the poles his chief of staff 
said today 
the announcement followed a crucial meeting of kohls coalition 
government which was seriously divided over the chancellors 
previous handling of the border issue 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff said the coalition 
partners had agreed to introduce a resolution in parliament on 
thursday favoring a treaty recognizing the current borders with 
poland 
seiters said the resolution would not include kohls demands 
made friday that any such treaty be linked with assurances by 
poland to honor its 1953 decision not to seek war reparations from 
germany and its pledge last year to guarantee the ethnic rights of 
its german minority 
it was not clear whether the resolution would state as kohl 
has many times insisted that only the government of a united 
germany can have final say on the border issue 
kohls previous pronouncements on the border issue have angered 
the poles and resulted in severe criticism at home even from his 
junior coalition partners the free democrats of foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher 
genscher and kohl failed to settle their differences in a 
meeting on monday leaders of kohls coalition government met again 
today to try to reach a compromise

the uncertainties looming ahead with the 
prospect of german reunification have given east germans cold feet 
and touched off a new political crisis in west germany 
east germanys leading politicians on monday called for a new 
social charter to be adopted in both germanys that would preserve 
the protections they have enjoyed under socialism like guaranteed 
employment and affordable rent and food prices 
the proposed social charter adopted at weekly negotiations 
between the communists and 15 other parties reflects just how 
hesitant many east germans are about plunging ahead with a merger 
with capitalist west germany and abandoning the life theyve known 
for 40 years 
in bonn chancellor helmut kohl fueled the controversy raging 
over his refusal to unequivocally recognize germanys border with 
poland 
he told reporters monday that germans should be wary of polands 
1953 pledge not to seek world war ii reparations contending polish 
officials have been pressing claims for the past three years for 
compensation of forced labor by poles under the third reich 
but kohl backed off the reparations issue today his chief of 
staff rudolf seiters said kohl agreed to formally state support 
for a treaty on polands western border without asking for 
concessions from the poles 
the announcement followed a crucial meeting of kohls coalition 
government which has been seriously divided over the chancellors 
handling of the border issue 
seiters said the coalition partners agreed to introduce a 
resolution in parliament thursday favoring a treaty recognizing the 
current borders with poland 
it was not clear whether the resolution would state as kohl 
has many times insisted that only the government of a united 
germany can have final say on the border issue 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki of poland has called on the 
two germanys to begin talks aimed at a treaty recognizing the 
current border formed by the oder and neisse rivers as the 
permanent boundary between poland and a united germany 
about a third of modernday poland was german territory prior to 
world war ii and warsaw fears a united germany might seek to 
recover the regions 
the chancellors obstinance angered poles opposition social 
democrats in west germany the world war ii allies who retain 
control of berlin and even members of his own centerright 
coalition government 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had distanced himself 
from kohl on the border issue and warned him that reopening the 
issue of war reparations for poland could backfire 
kohls conservative christian democratic union governs in 
partnership with genschers liberal free democrats and with the 
archconservative christian social union of bavaria 
the christian social unions chairman theo waigel last year 
called for unification within the 1937 borders of germany which 
would include the huge territorities of silesia and east prussia 
lost to poland and the soviet union after the nazi defeat in 1945 
the christian democrats and free democrats also appear to be at 
odds over how unification should be accomplished with kohls party 
urging a unilateral decision by east german states to merge with 
west germany 
a leading parliamentarian of the free democratic party burkhard 
hirsch contends no right of secession exists for that east german 
states 
the opposition social democrats oppose an immediate vote by a 
newly seated east german parliament to merge with west germany 
calling instead for a convention to draft a joint constitution 
the social charter adopted at the east german political talks 
demands that the right to work and the right to housing be 
enshrined in a new constitution for a united germany 
if adopted by the east german parliament chosen in the march 18 
election the charter should serve as the basis for negotiations 
with west germany on monetary and social union opposition minister 
gerhard poppe said 
the charter proposal illustrates the strong social democratic 
leaning of east germanys political forces the countrys social 
democrats are expected to poll a majority in the election 
east germans have traditionally viewed their social security 
programs as the paramount achievement of over 40 years of communist 
rule and are nervous about the prospects of a headlong plunge into 
capitalisms cold waters 
once efficient western methods are introduced to east germanys 
governmentcontrolled industry for example the nownegligible 
unemployment rate among the countrys 9 millionstrong workforce 
could jump to as much as 15 percent rent prices are also likely to 
surge 
east germans in general know little about west germanys social 
security system viewed as one of western europes most generous 
the conservative alliance for germany the east german political 
grouping backed by kohls christian democratic union has appealed 
to voters not to fear the switch to capitalism 
social minister norbert bluem of west germany appeared at a news 
conference with leaders of the east german christian democrats and 
noted that the bonn government already spends about 410 billion 
per year on social services or more than 6500 per capita

racial tensions at a shopping mall should 
be eased by an agreement to hire more blacks promote blackowned 
businesses and end racial harassment officials say 
i think when you hire people and give them economic 
opportunity it has a tendency to cut down on some of the racial 
strife state sen kay patterson said monday 
the agreement calls for hiring and promoting more blacks by the 
columbia mall management and encouraging stores to do the same and 
using more black contractors and suppliers management would also 
would no longer use a segregationera trespassing law to detain 
blacks 
patterson who led other black officials in calling for the 
resignation of a sheriff who allegedly used a racial slur in 
describing how crime at the mall could be reduced said the pact 
with the mall was long long overdue 
dr william f gibson national chairman of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said the 
agreement was the first of its kind but the problems at columbia 
mall were not unique he urged other naacp chapters to negotiate 
similar agreements 
informal studies show blacks make up 30 percent to 40 percent of 
the malls 150000 weekly customers gibson said 
the agreement was reached in the spirit of cooperation but 
is not legally binding on the mall said george forbes an attorney 
for the malls owner jacobs visconi and jacobs of cleveland 
the columbia mall does not it has not and it will not 
discriminate as regards to race creed or color added forbes a 
longtime member of the naacp 
the pact stemmed from allegations that about 50 black teenagers 
had been detained last summer by mall security officers under a 
1960s antitrespassing law designed to maintain segregation in 
most cases no criminal charges were ever filed 
in december two black teenagers were shot inside the mall the 
latest of four such incidents 
the mall discontinued its practice of detaining black youths 
under the trespass law about a month ago jacobs said

a tehran newspaper close to irans 
president said today that 1990 will be the last year of captivity 
for the hostages in lebanon and resumption of usiranian ties is 
not a precondition for their release 
in a second editorial the englishlanguage tehran times said 
syrian president hafez assad would visit tehran soon after an 
expected trip by his foreign minister farouk alsharaa it also 
denied reports that a trip by the brother of president hashemi 
rafsanjani to the syrian capital of damascus last week was related 
to the hostage question 
syria is the main power broker in lebanon with 40000 troops 
there 
both editorials in the government newspaper were excerpted by 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
recent statements from iranian newspapers saying the hostages 
should be released along with optimistic assessments by syrian and 
other officials have fueled reports that a hostage release is 
imminent 
in beirut today the respected annahar daily ruled out any 
release soon but quoted unidentified lebanese fundamentalist 
sources as saying iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue 
the sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct 
contacts between iran and the united states but both were scouting 
for what was described as a mechanism for releasing the hostages 
the report did not elaborate 
an assad visit to iran was expected syria was persian irans 
only staunch arab backer in its 198088 war against iraq the arch 
foe of damascus iran and syria are also in frequent contact over 
lebanon where they back rival shiite moslem militias 
the tehran times statement said visits between capitals was a 
very normal thing noting that the sensation on the hostage issue 
created by the western media over such visits was much too 
fancied 
for the second time in as many weeks the newspaper said the 18 
westerners in lebanon believed held by proiranian shiite moslem 
factions should go free without preconditions 
in the past the paper has reflected the thinking of president 
hashemi rafsanjani 
our own assessment indicates that this thorny issue can be 
sorted out in the near future in a sincere spirit by sincere 
people the paper said adding 1990 can and will be the last 
year of the captivity of these hostages 
it said an effort was under way to free the hostages because 
islam in no way allows or condones the idea that people should be 
taken or held hostage 
in washington on monday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said there were no grounds for expecting an imminent release but 
said many people outside the us government were involved in talks 
to win their freedom 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who will mark his 5th 
anniversary in captivity on march 16 anderson is one of the eight 
americans in captivity along with four britons two west germans 
two swiss an irishman and an italian 
rafsanjani has indicated the desire to separate iran from the 
hostage issue as he seeks western technology and financing to 
rebuild irans troubled economy 
but the factions holding the hostages are said to be more loyal 
to radicals in the tehran government who oppose rafsanjani they 
viewing confrontation with the west as the wellspring of the 
islamic revolution 
the tehran times said today that there were no direct talks 
between tehran and washington on resuming relations according to 
the irna report which was monitored in nicosia 
at this hour iranus relations are not under discussion and 
such a move is also not supported by the leader of the islamic 
republic and its top officials said the paper 
it reiterated its groundbreaking feb 22 statement that the 
hostage ordeal should be solved without any preconditions and 
should not be related to resuming ties with washington 
ties were broken following the 1979 attack on the us embassy 
in tehran that resulted in 52 americans being held hostage for 444 
days 
the paper said the visit to damascus by mahmoud hashemi had 
nothing to do with freedom for the hostages 
a syrian source who refused to be identified further said 
sunday that the meeting between hashemi a foreign ministry 
official and syrias foreign minister farouk alsharaa was to 
coordinate efforts to gain the release of all the hostages 
the source said hashemi had arrived from beirut where he met 
with senior shiite moslem figures on the hostage issue

many of the 20000 communist party 
employees who lost their jobs when the party was dissolved are 
having a hard time finding new work some because of 
discrimination a newspaper reported 
the provincial and local party secretaries instructors 
drivers clerical workers porters and others employed by the party 
were fired when the discredited communist party dissolved itself in 
january 
trybuna the newspaper of the social democracy party which 
replaced the former ruling party said monday that most of those 
dismissed have reported to labor offices in need of new jobs 
the return to normal work is sometimes difficult the 
newspaper said 
it implied that part of the problem was an anticommunist 
bias fueled by local solidarity leaders 
a director of an enterprise uncertain of his own future is 
not that eager to hire former employees of the party apparatus 
the trybuna article said he is simply afraid that at some point 
somebody might accuse him of maintaining contacts with the former 
communist party 
as we can see anticommunist pressure is big there are 
enterprises where they say that in case of workforce 
reductions the first to be fired will be former communist party 
members the newspaper said such an attitude doesnt have much 
in common with the governments promise that the only criterion 
will be skill 
discrimination against communists would be a reversal of decades 
of bias against opposition activists 
after the 1981 martiallaw crackdown to repress solidarity for 
example thousands of workers had to verify their loyalty to 
the communist government and those considered politically suspect 
lost their jobs 
former communist bosses also often held significiant power in 
the assignment of jobs and privileges on the local level where the 
party and the government were intertwined 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki taking charge of the east 
blocs first noncommunist government last fall said there should 
be no vengeful purge of party loyalists from central or local 
governments institutions or businesses

two new supreme court rulings will make it 
much more difficult for convicted criminals including many of the 
nations 2200 death row inmates to get help in federal courts 
the rulings generally bar defendants from invoking new 
constitutional decisions to attack their state court convictions 
after they have exhausted their initial round of appeals 
that means prisoners may not base their appeals on favorable 
court rulings issued in other cases after their own convictions 
become final in state appellate courts 
by identical 54 splits the court monday upheld death sentences 
for two men on death row in south carolina and oklahoma 
in each case the courts conservative bloc chief justice 
william h rehnquist and justices byron r white sandra day 
oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy joined to form 
the majority 
in each the courts liberals justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens 
dissented 
the courts new and stringent rule was announced in the case of 
south carolina death row inmate horace butler it evoked a sharp 
dissenting opinion by brennan 
after today he wrote for the four dissenters despite 
constitutional defects in the state process leading to their 
conviction or sentencing state prisoners will languish in jail 
or others like butler will die because state courts were 
reasonable even though wrong 
brennan said that with the ruling in butlers case the court 
has finally succeeded in its thinly veiled crusade to eviscerate 
federal laws passed by congress to protect criminal defendants 
rights 
writing for the majority rehnquist said federal courts should 
not review reasonable goodfaith interpretations of existing 
precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be 
contrary to later decisions 
in the oklahoma case of robyn leroy parks the court said he is 
barred from contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore 
sympathy before it sentenced him to death 
the court said parks should not have been allowed to raise such 
a constitutional argument in a federal court challenge after having 
exhausted his direct appeals in state courts 
the presiding judge told parks sentencing jury you must 
avoid any influence of sympathy sentiment passion prejudice or 
other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence 
the justices left unanswered whether such a jury instruction is 
constitutional 
in another death penalty ruling the court struck down a key 
portion of north carolinas death penalty law invalidating the 
death sentences of most of the states 84 death row inmates 
and in a separate decision the court upheld a california 
killers death sentence by ruling that the instructions given to 
his sentencing jury were valid

a federal judge accused of using his office 
to do favors for convicted felons testified that he called another 
judge to ask to be a character witness in a case not to sway the 
judges decision 
in his first day on the stand monday us district judge robert 
aguilar contradicted numerous prosecution witnesses and in one 
case apparently his own previous taperecorded conversation in 
fighting charges that could cost him his career and his freedom 
he said he was unaware that his former legal secretary vera 
hoff was a fugitive from a tax evasion sentence when he visited 
her in mexico in 1981 and 1982 or when he told deputy marshals in 
1980 that he did not know her address 
he also denied knowing about a wiretap that he is accused of 
twice disclosing to its target abe chapman a codefendant in the 
case and a former relative of aguilar by marriage aguilar appeared 
to acknowledge knowing about a chapman wiretap in a conversation 
that was secretly taperecorded and played for the jury last week 
aguilar 58 of san jose is charged with eight felonies 
punishable by 55 years in prison and 2 million in fines he also 
could be removed from office by congress regardless of the verdict 
accusations that he tried to influence two fellow judges aided 
a fugitive and devised a coverup are combined in a charge that he 
used his office as a racketeering enterprise to obstruct 
justice it is the first such charge against a federal judge 
aguilar testified monday that he intended nothing improper in 
january 1987 when he phoned us district judge samuel conti about 
the case of ronald cloud aguilars longtime friend and former law 
client cloud a former nevada casino owner was later convicted of 
bank fraud in a jury trial before conti 
aguilar said his only purpose was to ask him if he had any 
objection to my testifying in his court as a character witness 
he said he began by telling conti that cloud was a very sick man 
a very old man and hes a friend of mine and was about to ask 
about appearing as a witness when conti changed the subject 
he also said he did not think it was improper when he later 
wrote down several suggestions to pass along to clouds lawyer for 
his appeal 
the prosecution contended aguilar was trying to use his 
influence with conti to aid clouds case and showed his intention 
by trying to aid clouds appeal

rock singer ozzy osbourne whos been known to 
bite the heads off bats and pigeons chose to send a telegram when 
faced with a righteous cardinal 
you are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs 
osbourne wrote monday to cardinal john j oconnor who in a sermon 
singled out the heavymetal musician as especially satanic 
you have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over 
the world and i recommend you do a little research before making 
your opinions in the future osbourne said 
the former lead singer of black sabbath took offense when 
oconnor singled out osbournes suicide solution as typifying 
the songs that lead to demonic possession and even suicide 
if you want to discuss this matter with me personally you can 
call me any time and i will only be too happy to discuss this with 
you in private god bless you osbourne wrote 
osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19yearold who 
committed suicide while listening to another osbourne song the 
lawsuit was later dismissed 
the thrash rocker says that suicide solution was really 
about the dangers of alcohol which caused the death of his friend 
bon scott lead singer of acdc 
the song osbourne told the associated press in 1987 was 
nothing more than a warning to people on the dangers of drinking 
too much alcohol the song was a warning to me as well as 
everyone else if i hear it enough maybe it will have an effect 
osbourne acknowledges he still has a drinking problem

human testing of a potential aids 
vaccine the first to be approved by a state board without going 
through the federal process is scheduled to begin soon at two 
california hospitals 
the california department of health services food and drug 
branch announced monday that clinical tests of hgp30 will start in 
two or three months at san francisco general hospital and the 
university of southern califorer in los angeles 
researchers are seeking 24 healthy volunteers who test negative for 
exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes 
aids 
this initial test is to nia medical centdetermine the vaccines safety 
but 
scientists also will watch to see if the volunteers bodies make 
protective antibodies against the vaccine a hint that it might 
someday provide protection against acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
it is a very limited small study the first step in vaccine 
development in humans said dr james kahn who will conduct the 
testing in san francisco its not something thats going to cure 
aids and it is not intended as a cure or treatment for aids 
if it is proven safe the next step would be to see if it can 
prevent aids and researchers say that only after safety and 
effectiveness are proven a process that could take many years 
would the vaccine be distributp of 
alexandria va 
researchers hope the body when exposed to the synthetic 
protein will be tricked into thinking it has been exposed to the 
true hiv protein and will launch an immune response against it 
once successful immunization with hgp30 is achieved an 
individual should be protected from all the various strains of the 
aids virus said dr allan l goldstein of the george washington 
university school of medicine who led the team that discovered 
hgp30 
its manufacturer became impatient with the us food and drug 
administration approval process and began giving the vaccine to 
british men last may no results are yet available from this study 
under a new state law a drug or vaccine can be tested in 
california if it is made and approved in the state this law was 
designed to circumvent the lengthy fda approval process speeding 
up availability of antiaids agents 
by the end of last month the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta had recorded 121645 cases of aids in the united 
states with 72580 deaths or 60 percent of all cases

a state legislator said turnout today 
holds the key to whether he survives a recall election forced by 
opponents of spearfishing rights for wisconsins chippewa indians 
rep james holperin a fourterm democrat is wisconsins first 
state legislator to face a recall since 1932 
he was challenged by sayner businessman gene ahlborn in todays 
democratic race the winner meets republican brian sherren in the 
april 3 election for holperins assembly seat 
the turnout will be critical holperin said monday the 
turnout in special elections have generally not been that good if 
turnout is low i believe i will not do as well and will be 
beaten 
the polls opened at 8 am and oneida county clerk dick 
macdonald said today that clerks are expecting a big turnout 
because of the controversy 
the vote to remove the 39yearold legislator comes after years 
of turmoil over the chippewas rights to catch walleye with spears 
in northern wisconsin 
in 1983 a federal court ruled the chippewas had the right to 
spearfish hunt cut timber and gather food off the reservation 
under 19th century treaties that ceded northern wisconsin to the 
us government the ruling is under appeal 
vilas and oneida counties which holperin represents have been 
the scene of angry confrontations between nonindians and chippewa 
spearfishermen in recent years 
organizers of the recall claimed holperin lost touch with his 
constituents over the issue 
opponents were especially critical of his support for republican 
gov tommy g thompsons negotiated plan to pay the lac du flambeau 
chippewa band 50 million in cash and other aid over 10 years if 
they curtailed exercise of their treaty rights tribal members 
voted down the plan last fall 
recall backers noted that surveys indicated 70 percent of 
holperins constituents opposed the plan 
stop treaty abusewisconsin a group that objects to allowing 
indians to spearfish something nonindians cannot do gathered 
more than 6000 signatures to force the recall 
these people are crying for representation said 
ahlborn 50 i will listen to the people it is just that plain 
and simple 
holperin repeatedly has said he does not support court rulings 
that upheld the indians treaty rights he said the lease 
settlement was a way to defuse the confrontations while the appeals 
weaved through the courts 
if holperin loses it is going to be a threat to anyone who 
does anything that a special interest groups disagrees with said 
gary greenland a professor of history and political science at 
nearby nicolet college

government in kabul today but failed kabul radio said 
pakistanbased guerrillas and diplomats said they had reports of 
widespread fighting in kabul 
in moscow official soviet sources said the palace of president 
najib was bombed by unidentified planes and that there was 
fighting around the defense ministry 
official kabul radio monitored in islamabad said defense 
minister shah nawaz tanai had plotted with guerrilla leader 
gulbuddin hekmatyar and his fighters to overthrow the government 
but the attempted coup was crushed it said and tanai had 
escaped security forces were searching for him and his backers 
the radio appealed to afghans to join the military and help 
capture tanai dead or alive 
a curfew was imposed at 7 pm in kabul the radio said 
hekmatyar leader of hezbiislami one of the most 
fundamentalist of the seven resistance groups based in pakistan 
said the guerrillas were broadcasting appeals on the afghan armys 
military frequency urging soldiers to help oust najib and his 
government 
now is the time for all afghan people to join hands topple 
this regime and finish the fighting hekmatyar said at a news 
conference in islamabad 
najib has been president of afghanistan since 1986 he has made 
various offers to the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors to try to end the civil war that started when his 
marxist party seized power in a 1978 coup 
tanai is considered a party hardliner who opposes the peace 
overtures he was implicated in a december coup attempt but never 
charged 
guerrilla sources based in pakistan said they had reports from 
their commanders of widespread fighting in kabul 
if kabul radio says it the coup has been crushed it doesnt 
mean it has said a guerrilla source 
tanai one of the leaders of the revolution that installed the 
sovietbacked government has reportedly had contacts recently with 
the moslem guerrillas 
guerrillas in the pakistan frontier city of peshawar indicated 
they would give the general sanctuary probably said one 
guerrilla source when asked if the rebels would help tanai evade 
afghan troops

antiaircraft guns returned fire shooting also was heard in the 
vicinity of the airport and near the defense ministry tass said

reporters earlier in a news briefing that a coup attempt possibly 
was under way 
there is fighting at the airport the situation is unclear it 
may be a coup attempt he said we must wait for information 
we dont know who is fighting who 
he said it was too early to say what action the soviet union 
would take in the event najib was overthrown 
western diplomats in islamabad also reported street fighting 
aerial bombardments by the afghan air force tank movement around 
the soviet embassy and fighting around the presidential palace 
they did not know if the tanks were being moved to defend the 
embassy or to attack it 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said they had 
received their information from numerous sources but declined to 
elaborate 
radio kabul said aslam watanjar the countrys interior 
minister will replace tanai 
tanai has been involved in at least three of five known coup 
attempts since najib became president in december 1986 afghan 
sources in new delhi said 
the most recent was in december when at least 100 members of 
the khalqi faction of the peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
were detained the sources said on condition of anonymity similar 
accounts were given by kabul residents 
tanai thought to be in his mid 40s has a reputation as an 
ultra hardliner especially when it comes to making any 
concessions to the mujahedeen or modifying the stand of his party 
although its origins are marxist the party under najib has sought 
to portray itself as a defender of islam and champion of a 
freemarket economy 
tanai is a member of the partys politburo which currently has 
14 members according to senior party members 
soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan in february 1989 after 
10 years of waging war against rebels trying to oust successive 
sovietbacked regimes 
guerrilla attacks intensified after the pullout and some 
observers predicted najibs days were numbered but the guerrillas 
were unable to secure major cities government troops repelled 
attacks on such cities as jalalabad and khost 
international operators in moscow reported that telephone lines 
to kabul were damaged

the justice department said today it will ask 
the supreme court to review a second federal judges ruling that a 
new law making it a crime to burn the american flag is 
unconstitutional 
justice department spokesman david runkel said government 
attorneys intend to appeal mondays ruling here by us district 
judge june green 
the justice department has already filed a notice of its 
intention to ask the supreme court to review a similar ruling feb 
21 by a federal judge in seattle 
both judges struck down the flag protection act of 1989 and 
dismissed criminal charges against defendants accused of flag 
burning the judges said the statute violates the first amendments 
protection of free speech 
it would be our expectation the court would consolidate those 
cases runkel said 
the law provides for direct appeal of districtcourt rulings to 
the supreme court such rulings have legal effect only in the 
geographical area covered by the district court 
the ruling monday gave opponents of the law their second victory 
in less than two weeks but it also gives proponents of a 
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning more political 
ammunition for their cause 
president bush endorsed the amendment route to undo last years 
supreme court ruling that struck down a texas flagburning law 
saying he was unsure that the statute congress passed instead would 
survive court challenges 
in mondays decision green held that flag burning is a form of 
political speech protected by the first amendment she rejected the 
justice departments contention that the law was enacted to protect 
the flag not regulate speech 
however compelling the government may see its interests they 
cannot justify restrictions on speech which shake the very 
cornerstone of the first amendment the judge wrote 
for in protecting the flag for those who wish to wave it in 
support of these causes but preventing the defendants from burning 
it in opposition the government has created a regulation which 
cannot be justified without reference to the content of the 
defendants message she wrote 
green dismissed flagburning charges against shawn d eichmann 
david g blalock and scott w tyler the three were arrested last 
oct 30 after they set several flags on fire during a protest 
outside the us capitol 
conviction under the law carries a oneyear sentence 
the right to dissent is sometimes an albatross which burdens 
our society with its offensive sounds yet political dissent lies 
at the heart of the first amendments protection green wrote 
it would not be needed if the persons who exercise their right 
of free expression by word and action were all pleasing lovable 
persons with whom the rest of the citizens agreed she said 
the first amendment of course makes no invidious exceptions 
it provides protection for everyone including the defendants 
william kunstler a new york attorney who handled both the 
washington and seattle cases for the center for constitutional 
rights hailed the ruling saying we have knocked out an 
offensive statute in the area of the first amendment 
but kunstler predicted that there would be a long fight over 
passage of a constitutional amendment if both the washington and 
seattle rulings are upheld by the supreme court 
we passed phase one we are going into phase two kunstler 
said if we win we go into phase three which is this horrible 
amendment which the president is sitting back and licking his 
chops over

the leaders of the soviet union and east germany 
said today that nato membership for a unified germany is not 
acceptable and proposed a staged approach for the merger of the two 
countries 
at a kremlin meeting president mikhail s gorbachev and east 
german premier hans modrow also urged that poland be included in 
discussions between the united states britain france and the 
soviet union on unification 
after the meeting foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
said gorbachev dismissed the idea of a united germany remaining 
in nato 
it is clear to us that it does make a difference if a united 
germany is to be a nato member gerasimov quoted gorbachev as 
saying 
president bush and west german chancellor helmut kohl have said 
a unified germany should remain a full member of nato in talks in 
washington late last month kohl said a neutral unified germany 
would be a false solution 
east german spokesman wolfgang meyer said the leaders agreed 
nato membership for a unified germany would be a continuation of 
the cold war in the present era 
modrow came to moscow to discuss german unification economic 
cooperation polish borders and soviet security after east 
germanys free elections on march 18 
he returned to berlin this afternoon 
until the hardline communist regime of erich honecker crumbled 
last fall east germany was the soviet unions firmest ally in 
eastern europe and it remains the kremlins chief trading partner 
gerasimov said gorbachev saw a bright future for trade with 
unified germany he was very optimistic about our future 
relations if unification proceeded as it should that is 
stagebystage gerasimov said 
he said both sides wanted a meeting of the four world war ii 
victors the soviet union the united states france and britain 
before the east german elections 
all countries except the united states have given the 
goahead gerasimov said 
gorbachev and modrow agreed poland should be included in the 
unification process spokesmen for the leaders said 
the two sides are of the opinion that not a single question 
concerning poland can be considered without it poland mayer 
said the same applies to all neighbors of east germany and west 
germany 
germanys attack on poland on sept 1 1939 started world war 
ii poland lost territory to the soviet union but gained land from 
germany at the wars end and poland has asked the german states for 
a treaty that guarantees the oderneisse river border as the 
permanent frontier

czechoslovakias first free 
elections in more than four decades will be held on june 8 and 9 
parliament announced today 
the balloting for both houses of parliament will be based on the 
principle of proportional representation said a parliament 
statement carried by the official ctk news agency parties will 
need 10000 signatures to run a candidate and at least 5 percent of 
the national vote for a mandate ctk said 
czechoslovakias peaceful revolution late last year toppled the 
hardline communist leadership of milos jakes ending more than 40 
years of communist rule and paving the way for the first free 
elections since 1946 
in keeping with a decision to streamline the countrys 
legislative body the number of seats in the house of people one 
of parliaments two chambers has been reduced from 200 to 150 
seats 
of those 101 will go to candidates in the czech lands while 49 
will be allocated to deputies from the countrys smaller republic 
slovakia ctk said 
in the second chamber the house of nations the 150 seats were 
divided evenly between representatives from the two republics 
the decision to cut the number of seats came under a move to 
transform the parliament into a less unwieldy fulltime 
legislature under communist rule the parliament was largely a 
rubberstamp institution for party policy that met only a few days 
a year 
in another development the czech national council the regional 
parliament approved an amendment to the republics constitution 
monday dropping the socialist from its name czech 
socicalist republic ctk reported 
the slovak national council passed an identical law on friday 
deputies of the czech council also supported a proposal by 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel to drop the word socialist 
from the countrys formal name making it the czechoslovak 
republic 
the czech and slovak lands were united in czechoslovakia in 1918 
after the dissolution of the austrian habsburg monarchy in world 
war i the country was named the czechoslovak republic from 1918 
until 1960 when the communists added the definition socialist

archaeologists have unearthed a pink 
pearl believed to be 4000 years old stirring excitement on this 
persian gulf island whose oil riches overshadow its former glory as 
the land of the pearls 
this is an excellent find the most romantic find of the 
decade said robert killick director of the joint londonbahrain 
archaeological expedition 
unlike gold or silver trinkets ancient pearls are extremely 
rare finds because their surfaces peel and they disintegrate he 
said 
killick said the pearl which was four millimeters in diameter 
was from the dilmun era 45 to 50 centuries ago when the island 
thrived as a major trading center between mesopotamia now iraq 
and the indus valley of west asia 
killick said the pearl was believed 4000 years old because his 
expedition which involves bahrains ministry of information and 
the british academy was digging through an ancient town dating to 
that time 
bahrains pearling industry thrived in the past three centuries 
but tapered off with the advent of japans artificial pearl 
industry and the vast wealth earned from oil

the sr71 blackbird spy plane ended its 
last flight today apparently shattering at least three airspeed 
standards as it crossed the continent on its way to museum display 
initial calculations put its flight time at 68 minutes and 32 
seconds 
the aircraft to be displayed by the smithsonian institution 
touched down at washington dulles international airport at 1050 
am est said jack weir of the airport operations office 
the aircraft had taken off in a fiery blast from its mojave 
desert airfield at air force plant 42 at 430 am pst or 730 
am est after flying over california for a time it took on fuel 
before officially beginning its flight and landed at the airport 
some 20 miles outside washington dc 
weir said officials were still determining whether the spy 
plane which is being mothballed because of budget cuts broke four 
records as intended theyre still computing all that said 
weir just after the landing 
unofficially it set at least three records weir said one 
was fastest transcontinental flight he said it was not 
immediately known what the other two were weir said the flight 
time was initially determined to be 68 minutes 32 seconds 
it was awesome said air force col tom hornung of the 
liftoff it was a fitting end to a great air force program 
flying the ominouslooking black plane were pilot lt col 
raymond e yeilding and his reconnaissance systems officer lt 
col j d vida 
at speeds exceeding mach 3 or three times the speed of sound 
the crew planned to attempt four speed records on the way 
the crew was trying to best a world record from los angeles to 
washington a world record from kansas city to washington a world 
record from st louis to cincinnati and a national record from the 
west coast to the east coast any records must be certified by the 
federation aeronautique international 
the blackbird spy plane was a successor aircraft to the u2 spy 
plane one of which was shot down on a spying mission over the 
soviet union during the eisenhower administration 
the blackbird the worlds fastest operational aircraft has 
never been shot down although it has collected virtually tons of 
raw intelligence data from world hot spots during its 25year 
service life 
pilots flying sr71s already hold the world absolute records for 
speed 2193 mph and altitude 85069 feet 
after congressional debate late last year congress decided to 
go along with an air force request to mothball the blackbird fleet 
the air force contended that the program was too expensive compared 
to other budget priorities such as the b2 stealth bomber it also 
hopes to develop a new generation of fighter aircraft for the 21st 
century 
the blackbird planes remained popular with congressional 
intelligence committees and with other consumers of intelligence 
such as the cia and the state department the spy plane program has 
been carried as part of the air force budget

us officials said tuesday they are 
considering withdrawing 7000 troops from south korea by 1994 a 
number that would reduce us forces on the peninsula to the lowest 
level since the korean war 
also on tuesday south korean president roh taewoo warned north 
korea that the discovery of what seoul officials describe as an 
invasion tunnel across the 2mile demilitarized zone could lead to 
the communist nations selfdestruction 
a reduction of 7000 troops would leave roughly 36000 us 
servicemen in south korea it was reported earlier that the united 
states would be withdrawing about 5000 troops 
in the new proposal about 2000 air support personnel and 5000 
other troops would be evacuated officials said it has not been 
decided whether units of the 2nd infantry division key us ground 
troops deployed near the border would be affected they said 
as part of a series of defense reductions washington has asked 
seoul to increase the money it pays toward the upkeep of us 
troops stationed in south korea officials said 
other changes being considered could include the appointment of 
a korean to replace an american admiral as head of the united 
nations command delegation to the military armistice commission 
the usled command represents the 16 nations that fought 
alongside south korea during the 195053 korean war and help police 
the armistice that ended the conflict 
the 155mile border separating north korea from south korea is 
one of the most heavily fortified in the world and is sealed to 
prevent communication visits mail or telephone calls from one 
side to the other 
despite sporatic dialogue aimed at easing tensions the two 
nations remain enemies the sweeping changes that have created new 
political allignments in eastern europe show no sign of affecting 
north korea one of the last hardline communist states 
the tunnel discovered saturday was found 145 yards below the 
surface and is 2 yards wide and 2 yards high large enough for 
three fully armed soldiers to run abreast officials said they 
said a regimentsize army could pass through in an hour 
the north korean leaders must know that they could face a 
selfdestructive suicidal situation if they continue such 
antinational acts roh said in a speech at the korea military 
academy 
officials said the tunnel which begins in the northern sector 
of the neutral zone crosses about 1000 yards into south korean 
territory

generations of tires have rolled along 
the twomile strip of mchenry avenue where cruising has resisted 
fading into nostalgia with sock hops 45 rpm records and poodle 
skirts 
it was a world shown in the reminiscences of native son george 
lucas in his 1973 movie american graffiti 
but like rock n roll cruising has evolved into something 
wilder argue police and some business owners who want to curb the 
steady parade of teenagers and cars 
when people cruise mchenry we see an increase in gang 
activity in alcohol and substance abuse vandalism to businesses 
and disrespect in the neighborhoods said mayor carol whiteside 
were not willing to be a magnet for everyone in northern 
california who doesnt have anywhere else to go on friday night 
business owners tired of removing trash and graffiti from their 
property before opening monday mornings and police concerned they 
cant adequately patrol the carclogged avenue are pushing a pair 
of anticruising ordinances to be considered march 27 by city 
council 
under the proposals motorists would face fines if they pass 
designated checkpoints more than twice in a fourhour period 
pedestrians would risk loitering citations 
modestans may deny that cruising is a source of identity for the 
central california city dwarfed by the san francisco bay area 90 
miles to the west but its hard to find business owners or 
customers along mchenry avenue who didnt at some time cruise along 
some thoroughfare 
perhaps its the legacy of american graffiti along with the 
annual graffiti night which honors the cruising tradition in grand 
proportions that draws teenagers to mchenry avenue most friday 
and saturday nights sometimes 5000 vehicles strong 
were not here to look for trouble were here to have a good 
time this is what gathers all different people said 17yearold 
robert bennett who drove 15 miles from manteca 
a lot of people do bring cars for show said his companion 
matt meza 19 
joe hudson 19 drove 30 miles from tracy to find a group of 
girls hed met the week before not that the evening would be lost 
if they didnt show there goes a mustang with a blonde and a 
brunette he pointed out to two friends 
todays cruisers may have the same motives as their parents and 
grandparents but as car clubs give way to gangs pranks to 
violence and staticky radios to blaring stereo systems some 
residents wonder if its time to let cruising pass into legend 
modesto is maturing there is nothing wrong with cruising but 
its not a part of the way of life anymore said kyle barker a 
music store owner i think we accepted it 10 years ago one 
because i think it was more wholesome and two i think we were 
more naive about the consequences 
in lucas day a wellaimed water balloon may have gotten the 
perpetrators windshield smeared with shaving cream but probably 
wouldnt have drawn a knuckle sandwich 
the consequences today may be far more serious said police sgt 
gene wilkinson 
we may get somebody beat over the head with a baseball bat 
because he hit someone with a water balloon he said 
now during a typical weekend along mchenry avenue 50odd 
citations are issued and half dozen arrests are made wilkinson 
said 
its a different world than you had 25 or 30 years ago we 
have to address the problems of today wilkinson said 
i can understand the complaints of nostalgia buffs maybe 30 
years ago it would have been an overreaction but today all were 
trying to do is protect those we can 
mchenry avenue today is the address of hundreds of businesses 
and some owners say they lose customers when the daytime commuter 
corridor becomes overrun by low riders with rattling mufflers 
detailed pickup trucks and pastel colored vws 
commerce is america we have to earn a living if its in our 
way we have to stop it said raj jariya night clerk at the

american jews intend to raise 420 million 
this year for operation exodus to help settle a flood of soviet 
jews in israel fundraisers announced tuesday 
the money will be used to transport immigrants from the soviet 
union to refurbuish absorption centers in israel and to help in 
the initial costs of the resettlement 
the campaign begun last week is the largest special 
fundraising drive undertaken by the united jewish appeal which 
raises money for israel and for jewish communities in the united 
states and elsewhere said spokesman raphael rothstein 
so far more than 60 million have been pledged by wealthy 
jewish donors he said at a news conference the rest of the money 
is expected to be pledged this year but contributors will have 
three years to pay up he said 
soviet reforms have opened the doors to an unprecedented wave of 
jewish emigration most of it heading for israel in the first 15 
days of february some 4600 soviet jews arrived in israel more 
than twice the number that came to israel in all of 1988 the 
appeal said 
the jews departure has been speeded by fears of escalating 
antisemitism in the soviet union theres an urgency that may 
become an emergency rothstein said 
but the pace of emigration has been slowed by the kremlins 
refusal to implement an agreement for direct flights from moscow to 
tel aviv rothstein said jewish leaders are not hopeful that direct 
flights will be allowed any time soon because of intense pressure 
from the arab world which opposes the jewish immigration to israel 
he said discussions were underway for ships to carry some of the 
emigres from the black sea port of odessa to israel such a journey 
would last 2 days and would augment the flights from bucharest 
budapest and other transit points now used by soviet jews to reach 
israel 
the fund raising is based on projections that 200000 soviet 
jews will arrive in israel in the next few years although israeli 
officials say the figures could fluctuate with changing 
circumstances 
the israeli government will provide 3 billion for the 
absorption of the immigrants with the rest to be raised by world 
jewry 
israel has also asked the bush administration to guarantee 400 
million to build housing for the immigrants the administration has 
said it would support the guarantees if israel promised not to use 
the money for housing in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel has declined to provide such an outright pledge 
the disagreement has raised tensions between washington and 
israel already exacerbated by israeli stalling on a proposal by 
secretary of state james a baker iii for advancing peace talks 
with palestinians from the occupied territories 
rothstein said the political conflict has not spilled over into 
the fundraising campaign there is no indication that political 
considerations will affect peoples generosity he said

the senate today confirmed conservative civil 
rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge 
brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and 
senior citizens groups 
the senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but 
changed course at the last minute and confirmed thomas on a voice 
vote 
thomas 41 will be a judge on the us circuit court of appeals 
in the district of columbia 
as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission over 
the last eight years he has been one of the most visible black 
officials in the reagan and bush administrations 
thomas a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fight 
hiring discrimination has been highly praised by conservatives 
but liberals have criticized his record 
it became clear monday night that thomas critics had failed to 
muster enough support to defeat his nomination 
i am prepared to concede that mr thomas is going to be 
confirmed said sen howard m metzenbaum dohio a leading 
critic 
the only other opponent to materialize in the debate was sen 
david pryor dark chairman of the senate special committee on 
aging who complained that the statute of limitations on 15000 
agediscrimination cases before the eeoc ran out without any action 
being taken while thomas was in charge 
those cases might as well have been sent to beijing pryor 
said they might as well have been sent to bulgaria they might 
as well have been sent to romania its too much to overlook 
pryor said however that thomas was virtually guaranteed to win 
confirmation and added that he wished the nominee well in his new 
post 
danforth thomas chief senate supporter and former employer 
said he could vouch for the nominees abilities as a lawyer 
i hired him twice danforth said people say dont you 
ever make a mistake well yeah but not twice 
sen alan simpson rwyo dismissed complaints that thomas had 
failed to cooperate with the aging committee several years ago when 
former sen john melcher dmont was chairman 
simpson said the panels investigation of the employment 
commission was flawed to begin with 
they wasted a lot of time trying to nail clarence thomas he 
said 
thomas was born in poverty in rural georgia worked his way 
through college and is a graduate of yale law school before 
becoming chairman of the commission he worked under danforth in 
the missouri attorney generals office and in the senate as well 
for the monsanto corp 
civil rights forces have been divided over the nomination the 
alliance for justice a liberal courtwatcher group based in 
washington and several senior citizens groups have been critical 
but the national association for the advancement of colored people 
did not take a stand on the issue

president bush welcomed italian prime minister 
giulio andreotti to the white house today for discussions on giving 
italy a larger role in shaping a reunified germany 
we agree on the foundations of a new europe bush said in a 
speech on the south lawn welcoming andreotti to the white house 
the president stressed the ties between the united states and 
italy to which 12 million americans trace their descent 
our dialogue is constant it is substantive it is 
productive bush said 
responding andreotti said italy welcomed the dawn of 
democracy in eastern europe but without elaboration he said the 
new world that is emerging was fraught with problems and 
challenges 
meanwhile white house spokesman marlin fitzwater announced 
later that the united states has accepted a west german proposal 
for a twoplusfour meeting of subcabinet officials on march 14 
in bonn fitzwater said the officials would discuss the 
procedures for future substantive meetings on german unification 
the twoplusfour are the two germanys and the four powers that 
defeated nazi germany in world war ii the united states great 
britain france and the soviet union fitzwater said later meetings 
will be held only after the march 18 elections in east germany and 
after discussions between the two germanys themselves 
the state department said the twoplusfour formula would not be 
expanded to give a seat at the table to italy poland or any of the 
other smaller countries 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said the formula is designed 
with the four because the four have special legal rights and 
responsibilities since world war ii we have said as far as the 
others that we have definitely and are aware of all of their 
concerns and will listen to their concerns 
andreotti technically speaks only for italy as he asks bush to 
guarantee rome a place in the us formula for merging east germany 
with west germany 
but denmark norway and other small countries as well as 
poland and other victims of german aggression in eastern europe in 
world war ii have a stake in the outcome of andreottis talks 
with bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
its not a problem which belongs to italy andreotti said as 
he opened talks with bush in the oval office i think that all 
the member countries of the atlantic alliance must handle together 
these problems he said 
andreotti made an exception only of berlin the former german 
capital which is under the control of the united states the soviet 
union britain and france the specific problems related to 
berlin must be handled by the four countries he said 
he stressed that the north atlantic treaty organization the 
16member alliance between the united states canada and 14 
european countries and the european security conference a 
grouping of 35 east west and neutral nations should be updated to 
deal with changing circumstances 
the western alliance is ever more vital and necessary 
andreotti said 
the two plus four formula would have the two germanys make 
most of the basic arrangements for unification afterward the 
united states the soviet union britain and france the big four 
allies of world war ii would move into the planning to consider 
security issues and the new germanys place in europe 
baker gained soviet british and french acceptance of the 
approach at an open skies conference last month in ottawa 
canada last week visiting irish prime minister charles j haughey 
worked out an agreement with bush for additional consultations with 
the 12 nations of the european community 
still andreotti who heads italys 49th postwar government and 
is in his sixth nonconsecutive term as prime minister is uneasy 
last week in rome he called for closer cooperation between 
europe and north america and urged washington not to overlook its 
allies in negotiating german unification and other important 
political and security issues 
andreotti was quoted as saying that any breakdown in the 
uswestern european relationship at the close of the cold war 
would be truly absurd 
the prime minister said he did not fear a united germany would 
turn belligerent but he registered concern that interest rates 
could be driven up when west germany tries to help east german 
development 
a senior us official in a white house session monday with 
reporters said from our perspective italy is a very key player 
in european events we have made clear that while we think the two 
plus four mechanism is a very important mechanism it is only a 
first step a step in this larger process of german unification 
the official whose name could not be disclosed under rules of 
the briefing added we believe that there should be full 
alliance consultation on this process and there should be full 
involvement of all european nations concerned and that of course 
includes italy 
at another point the official described italy as a very key 
ally and said we attach a lot of importance to these regular 
consultations 
after the meeting with bush and lunch with baker at the state 
department andreottiplanned separate sessions with us trade 
representative carla hills attorney general dick thornburgh and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady he will be guest at a blacktie 
dinner tonight at the white house

the chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee on tuesday shelved a resolution that would have called on 
germany to stick to its present borders saying the rush of events 
made the proposal unnecessary 
sen claiborne pell dri withdrew his resolution after west 
german chancellor helmut kohls government indicated in bonn it 
would not lay claim to polish land 
i believe international pressure including the pressure 
generated by prospective action on my resolution contributed to 
chancellor kohls decision to provide the necesary assurances on 
the polishgerman border pell said at a committee hearing 
kohls government agreed to introduce a resolution in parliament 
saying that a united germany should sign a treaty promising it will 
never seek to recover polish land lost after the 1945 defeat of the 
third reich 
the senate panel also postponed action on a separate resolution 
that would have called for the leaders of poland and czechoslovakia 
to be included in talks about german reunification 
sen richard lugar rind said it would be premature to vote 
on the measure before a group of senators had a firsthand look at 
the tumultuous german situation 
lugar and members of an arms control observer group will travel 
next week to east and west germany and meet with kohl 
but sen paul simon dill who with sen barbara mikulski 
dmd introduced the second resolution pushed unsuccessfully for 
a vote its simply saying lets consult he said 
in fact we are sending the wrong signal by objecting said 
simon 
sen jesse helms rnc sided with lugar saying the senate 
shouldnt be dabbling in things that we dont know anything 
about 
simon said he assumed lugar was acting on behalf of the bush 
administration in holding up a vote on the measure an aide to 
lugar speaking on condition he not be identified said state 
department officials told lugar late monday they hadnt studied the 
resolution closely enough to have a final opinion

one musher in the iditarod trail sled dog 
race and his dogs were safe today after he had to kill an attacking 
moose with five pistol shots 
defending champion joe runyan held the lead today after passing 
fourtime winner rick swenson in the 1160mile race 
lorren weaver holding 44th place among the 68 racers still in 
the race and 78 miles behind runyan killed a moose that attacked 
his dogs on the trail between skwentna and finger lake race 
officials said 
searchers had set out on snowmobiles monday after two bush 
pilots reported seeing the moose attack a team of dogs 
one dog was gashed across the head but weaver 50 a physician 
fron knik and his team were otherwise unhurt they continued into 
finger lake checkpoint no 7 and 193 miles from the start of the 
race from anchorage to nome that started saturday 
race spokeswoman debbie croutch said the moose was without 
antlers but there was no report on whether it was a bull or a cow 
bulls often have dropped their racks this by time of year 
attacks by hungry moose plagued racers during training this 
year and some mushers carried rifles for protection the animals 
which weigh up to 1800 pounds have become aggressive because deep 
snow has made it hard to graze 
runyan and five other veteran racers overtook swenson during the 
sprint monday from rainy pass to rohn 271 miles into the race the 
group passing swenson included his archrival susan butcher 
swenson is the only person to have won the race four times 
butcher won in 1986 1987 and 1988 and took second place last year 
the iditarod race runs from anchorage to nome on the bering sea 
coast and crosses frozen rivers treeless tundra and huge mountain 
passes usually the race lasts 11 to 18 days or longer depending 
on weather and other conditions 
seventy mushers and dog teams left anchorage on saturday 
the iditarod named after a ghost town along the trail 
commemorates the delivery by sled dog teams of a lifesaving 
diphtheria serum to nome in 1925

the successor to the nowdissolved polish 
communist party is ready to turn over to warsaw university the 
massive building that was party headquarters for four decades 
the imposing building in central warsaw derisively dubbed the 
white house has been at the heart of a nationwide debate over 
regaining for the state treasury the vast holdings accumulated by 
the communists when they controlled the government 
during a weekend meeting the social democracy party which 
inherited the assets of the communist party when it disbanded in 
january agreed to hand over the central committee headquarters to 
a government commission with the recommendation it be given to the 
university said marek siwiec 
i dont have to hide our great joy said wlodzimierz 
siwinski deputy rector of the university which plans to use the 
building as a library 
the social democracy partys supreme council made the decision 
saturday and representatives met sunday with the commission 
established by the solidarityled government to review the legal 
status of communist party property the turnover of the building 
must be approved by all sides 
many of those who supported erection of the building wrote or 
called us demanding that it should remain in the hands of the 
polish left wing said siwiec editor of the social democracy 
newspaper trybuna 
but we hope that the needs of culture and science will get 
dominating respect and the building will go to the university 
siwiec said 
since the east blocs first noncommunistled government took 
power last fall the communists have been under intense pressure to 
return property no longer supported by membership or power 
on monday general secretary leszek miller reported the social 
democracy party had signed up 47000 members and said he was 
satisfied with its growth the communist party claimed a membership 
of 2 million 
the government commission set up by prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki to defuse public clamor to simply nationalize the 
communist holdings has found that many buildings were not actually 
owned by the party but had been loaned by city officials or other 
organizations 
during negotiations party leaders have have agreed to turn over 
1600 buildings and offices nationwide 
not without glee the newly independent press has devoted space 
in recent weeks to speculation over new uses for the headquarters 
with a mcdonalds restaurant one favored possibility 
but the sixfloor building with 490 rooms and three conference 
halls appears well suited for the university library woefully 
short of funds space and special facilities required to preserve 
rare books siwinski said 
the social democracy party will move its headquarters to one of 
the buildings it retains following the talks with the government 
siwiec said

facing international pressure 
to reopen palestinian universities israels army on tuesday 
allowed classes to resume at a west bank teachers college 
the peaceful resumption of classes at the arub academy and the 
planned reopening of other twoyear schools were seen as tests for 
a possible restart of universities that have been shut almost since 
the start of the 26monthold palestinian uprising 
but the army said soldiers closed two elementary schools and a 
middle school tuesday in the west bank city of nablus raising to 
27 the number of primary and secondary schools shut so far this 
year for disturbances 
arab education officials were told the latest closures were 
because pupils had stoned west bank military commander yitzhak 
mordechais military jeep 
the arub academy a mens college that trains students to teach 
english arabic islamic studies and geography was the scene of 
jubilant reunions tuesday with students kissing each other on the 
cheeks in a traditional arab greeting 
its one of the happiest days we have had said hamad 
sarsur the headmaster 
hurrying for class with a notebook in hand yousef asafreh said 
that because of army closures he has spent more than four years 
trying to get a teaching certificate in arabic that normally takes 
two years 
he and other students said the hillside campus located near the 
arub refugee camp on the road to hebron would not be used for 
political protests 
it is our central demand that we be educated said asafreh 
25 students understand that they cannot receive education with 
riots riots and education cannot go together 
arub had 82 students and 12 teachers before the uprising began 
in december 1987 but only 55 students showed up for class tuesday 
sarsur said he did not yet know if any students were in jail for 
antiisraeli activism 
he predicted unrest would not start on the arub campus adding 
the students are eager to return to their desks 
army officials said if there was no trouble at the arub college 
where classes were held peacefully tuesday then officials would 
open the other 15 community colleges 
it is going to be gradual said one official who demanded 
anonymity if there is no incitement or security violations we 
will see all of them open and functioning in a short time 
he and other officials declined to make specific pledges but 
suggested a peaceful reopening of junior colleges would pave the 
way for universities to resume operation 
the army has kept six palestinian universities with about 21000 
students and 16 junior colleges and vocational schools with about 
5000 students shut for 26 months 
officials say the campuses are potential rallying points for 
antiisraeli violence but palestinians contend the closures are an 
unjustified collective punishment 
a leaflet issued by the proplo underground leadership of the 
uprising tuesday called for rallies near college campuses saturday 
to demand the opening of universities and the freeing of jailed 
students 
israel is being urged by european countries and the united 
states to allow universities to resume in january the european 
parliament imposed a freeze on scientific cooperation with israel 
until the universities were reopened 
there was also a call by the israeli parliaments education 
committee to open one campus to test whether it was safe to resume 
classes at other institutions 
elsewhere police spokesman mordechai bareket said a 35yearold 
arab woman who had a police record as a prostitute and drug addict 
was killed in hebron her body was found in the yard of her house 
with the head smashed and bloodied 
arab reports described her as a collaborator with israeli 
authorities but police said she was not known as a collaborator 
the death brought to 192 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs during the uprising most for alleged collaboration or 
drug involvement some 659 palestinians have been killed by 
israelis and 43 israelis have also died 
in nablus the army used bulldozers to destroy the home of 
mohammed hawwash whose son jaber 20 was arrested last nov 8 and 
charged with being a member of the red eagles an underground group 
blamed for killing alleged collaborators six people lived in the 
threeroom house 
also tuesday the uprising leaders issued an order allowing 
stores in the occupied territories and arab east jerusalem to open 
for five hours daily adding two hours to the schedule shops have 
kept for most of the uprising 
a leaflet announced the move which marked the first easing of 
the strict discipline that the rebellions leaders have tried to 
maintain on palestinians

congressional republicans said tuesday they 
will try to force votes this year on a bill allowing some older 
americans with higher incomes to work without losing a part of 
their social security pension 
by penalizing seniors who wish to enhance their income and 
remain active members of the american work force current law 
actually makes it tougher for many seniors to support themselves 
said sen connie mack rfla 
our bill gives senior citizens a choice of whether they want 
to work or retire said rep dennis hastert rill chief house 
sponsor of the legislation 
the bill has been signed by 181 of the 435 members of the house 
the senate will act on the bill this year predicted 
sen phil gramm rtexas if the democraticcontrolled finance 
comittee fails to approve the measure he said we are going to 
vote on it over and over and over again on the senate floor 
eighteen of the 100 senators have voiced support for the bill 
a person who is at least 65 but under 70 may earn 9360 this 
year without losing any social security benefits for each 3 
earned above that amount the worker loses 1 of pension a person 
62 63 or 64 gives up 1 in benefits for each 2 earned above 
6840 there is no earnings limit on those 70 and older 
republicans have tried for a quarter century to repeal the 
earnings limit contending it effectively imposes the nations 
highest tax burden on older citizens the bush administration has 
not supported repeal 
the house approved a significant reduction in the earnings limit 
last year as did the senate finance committee but the measure was 
dropped in the senate as part of a deficitreduction agreement 
the house ways and means committee estimates that repealing the 
earnings limit would benefit only the bestoff 10 percent of people 
between 65 and 70 about one of every five americans in that age 
groups earns an income 
hastert cited a study predicting that if the limitation were 
repealed 700000 older people who do not now work would rejoin the 
labor force creating 132 billion in economic output he said 
repeal would cost the treasury 72 billion in federal tax revenues 
but 32 billion of that would be made up in tax collections on the 
new income

the senate on tuesday confirmed conservative 
civil rights official clarence thomas as a federal appeals judge 
brushing aside criticism from senior citizens and liberal groups 
senate opposition to thomas which once appeared powerful all 
but dissolved as the vote neared in the end the critics did not 
even request a roll call on the nomination and thomas was approved 
on a voice vote 
thomas 41 becomes a judge of the us circuit court of appeals 
in the nations capital sometimes called the nations second 
highest court because of the heavily spotlighted cases that come 
before it 
as chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission 
thomas has been one of the most visible blacks in the reagan and 
bush administrations 
he was praised by conservatives for his outspoken criticism of 
affirmative action programs and quotas as a means of fighting 
hiring discrimination but liberals have chafed under his tenure 
born on a poverty ridden farm in rural georgia thomas worked 
his way through college and graduated from yale law school 
supporters led by sen john c danforth rmo stressed 
thomas achievement in climbing the ladder the hard way as well as 
what they called his demonstrated legal ability 
thomas had worked for danforth both in the missouri attorney 
generals office and in the senate he also was an attorney with 
the monsanto corp 
despite the criticism from senior citizens and some civil rights 
leaders it became clear monday that opponents had failed to muster 
anything resembling the forces needed to defeat the nomination 
i am prepared to concede that mr thomas is going to be 
confirmed sen howard m metzenbaum dohio a leading critic 
said monday when the senate debated the nomination for about 90 
minutes 
the only other opponent to materialize in the debate was sen 
david pryor dark chairman of the senate special committee on 
aging 
both metzenbaum and pryor aimed their criticism at thomas 
handling of age discrimination cases at the eeoc pryor said the 
statute of limitations on thousands of such cases lapsed without 
action while thomas was in charge calling it too much to 
overlook 
thomas blamed state and local fairemployment commissions for 
the lapses 
mr thomas testimony reveals a fundamental lack of 
understanding of both the laws he has been charged with enforcing 
for the past eight years and the regulations and procedures of the 
agency he has chaired the american association of retired 
persons said in a letter to top judiciary committee lawmakers after 
that hearing 
however the aarp neither supported nor opposed confirmation 
the alliance for justice a liberal courtwatcher group based in 
washington campaigned hard to block confirmation

beset with a sinking economy and rising 
discontent soviet lawmakers made a drastic break with communist 
orthodoxy tuesday by voting to allow private citizens to own small 
factories and hire their own workers 
applause swept through the kremlin chamber as the supreme 
soviet by a 3503 vote with 11 abstentions passed the property 
law which the official tass news agency described as the main 
plank of president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for economic 
reform 
the law permits soviets for the first time in nearly seven 
decades to privately possess means of production an approach 
at odds with classic marxist thinking which sees in private 
ownership the roots of the capitalist exploitation wiped out by the 
russian revolution 72 years ago 
deputy premier leonid i abalkin said the law to go into effect 
july 1 will enable private citizens to own workshops garages for 
automotive repairs farm enterprises and other smallscale ventures 
to supplement the notoriously ineffective staterun economy 
also subject to restrictions from legislatures in the 15 soviet 
republics the law permits one citizen to hire another for pay a 
practice that currently is illegal and was a key target of the 
russian revolutionaries 
in the early 1920s vladimir i lenin and his bolsheviks 
temporarily retreated from their drive to implement communism and 
allowed private ownership of the means of production under the new 
economic policy or nep the policy was ended under lenins 
successor josef stalin 
tuesdays vote was hailed by supporters not as a tactical move 
backward but as a great advance toward a more just and prosperous 
society it again showed gorbachevs bent for pragmatism even when 
it runs counter to policies pursued by his predecessors for decades 
abalkin stressed to reporters that new appoaches were needed to 
wrench the country from its economic quagmire which he said was 
deepening either we speed up the reforms or we ship things 
using military transport he said 
he revealed that soviet economic performance had worsened in the 
past two months with industrial production slipping 1 percent 
there is a crisis of confidence of confidence in the 
government he added 
although the property law conserves large economic monopolies 
for the staterun sector it declares all forms of ownership 
juridically equal including property owned by individuals the 
government and collectives and says society gains by competition 
among them 
this is an enormous step forward because it lays down the 
principle of pluralism in the forms of ownership and the basis of 
their equality and their protection from the government said 
progressive lawmaker alexei yablokov 
in another sign of the new economic thinking a 
governmentsponsored preamble offered by abalkin proclaiming 
socialist property to be the foundation of the country 
officially named the union of soviet socialist republics failed to 
pass the 542seat legislature 
the preamble would turn the law into a propaganda slogan 
objected deputy konstantin d lubenchenko a senior lecturer in 
moscow state universitys law faculty 
despite its new stance on property rights the law continues to 
skirt the socialist aversion to private property by referring 
instead to the property of citizens 
its unfortunate that there is no mention of private property 
but the principle is there yablokov said soviets long have been 
permitted to own cars summer homes and other personal property 
and the new law wont change that 
abalkin said a key provision of the 23page document orders 
stateowned factories and other businesses to allocate a share of 
aftertax profits to workers 
by providing them with a material stake in their enterprises 
profitability the law will presumably encourage soviets to work 
harder a problem gorbachevs leadership has said is crucial to 
raising the often abysmal rate of productivity 
abalkin cautioned that the law was just a piece of paper and 
by itself wont bring about an economic miracle 
we need to change the stereotypes of behavior and peoples 
psychology he said apparently referring to the widespread 
soviet hostility toward any form of private enterprise 
laws on taxation as well as price reforms long postponed but 
now promised by jan 1 also are necessary for a decisive step 
towards a market economy abalkin said the kremlin keeps the 
prices of bread meat and other foodstuffs artificially low at the 
cost of billions of rubles in subsidies 
the property law preserves a government monopoly on the main 
pipelines for natural gas and other products the electric power 
grid space systems nationwide communications and information 
networks and defense industries 
neither the law nor a companion bill passed feb 28 by the 
supreme soviet allows the unrestricted buying and selling of land 
as many progressives had wanted although the law on land allows 
peasants to bequeath the plots they till to their children 
the supreme soviet also voted to incorporate traditional marxist 
rhetoric into the property law outlawing the use of any form of 
property for the exploitation of one man by another over loud 
objections that such wording was a sneak attack on private property 
the most basic exploitation of man and man comes from the 
government said moscow deputy mikhail a bocharov director of a 
pioneering construction materials plant where workers lease the 
premises from the state 
the supreme soviet voted separately on each of the bills six 
parts with the private property section passing 3540 with 13 
abstentions and then on the bill as a whole 
the draft under discussion since fall came back before the 
legislature two weeks ago but was returned to committee because of 
ambiguities 
after voting the legislature adjourned until it parent body 
the congress of peoples deputies meets monday the 2250member 
congress must give final approval to the property law since it will 
require amending the constitution whose article 10 still declares 
that the foundation of the economic system of the ussr is 
socialist ownership of the means of production

senior democrats on the senate finance 
committee on tuesday ridiculed president bushs revenue proposals 
and said the administration shows little interest in reducing the 
budget deficit 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas and sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny goaded kenneth gideon the assistant treasury 
secretary for tax policy to offer some alternative tax proposals 
gideon didnt bite 
i am here to defend our revenue proposals gideon said 
it looks to me like they are a mile wide and an inch deep 
and heavy with gimmicks bentsen said 
he was especially critical of a provision in the bush budget 
that the administration says would raise 25 billion just by 
improved management of the internal revenue service 
i find it very hard to accept the idea that by rearranging 
a few desks over there you are going to have any serious 
increase in revenue bentsen said 
you ought to come before this committee with respectable 
proposals moynihan told gideon i am embarrassed for your 
situation and i suspect you are too 
bentsen asked why the administration can propose raising the tax 
on aviation fuel and defend it as a user fee but oppose a higher 
tax on gasoline or automobiles 
we tried to be consistent with our proposals gideon 
replied we think a significant increase in gasoline taxes raises 
real problems because of disproportionately high use of fuel in 
rural states 
moynihan was especially upset because three of the revenue 
raisers in bushs budget would further the practice of using social 
security taxes for deficit reduction 
you dont want to deal with the deficit moynihan said 
the deficit is a mode of social discipline the administration 
he said is happy to argue against increased social spending by 
pointing to the size of the deficit 
the administration while saying its proposing no tax increase 
is asking congress to vote an additional 157 billion in new 
revenues for the budget year that begins oct 1 after subtracting 
18 billion worth of targeted tax reductions that would leave a 
net revenue gain of 139 billion 
those proposals range from raising the tax on airline tickets to 
requiring all state and local government employees to pay for 
social security hospitalization coverage 
bentsen told gideon that congressional authorities say bushs 
proposals would cut the deficit by only 94 billion not 139 
billion there is no way to raise 139 billion without raising 
taxes bentsen said 
gideon spent a good deal of his time at the hearing defending 
bushs proposal to cut taxes on capital gains which are profits 
from the sale of investments the administration contends a 
reduction would provide such an incentive to the economy that it 
would increase tax collections 
congressional leaders reject that point their analysts say the 
capitalgains cut would lose 114 billion over five years 
however the treasury department says it would gain 125 
billion a difference of 239 billion

as afghanistans defense minister maj 
gen shah nawaz tanai was supposed to lead the fight against moslem 
guerrillas instead he may have plotted with them against 
president najib 
the attempted coup tuesday illustrated the simultaneous 
challenges najib faces in trying to pacify enemies in his own party 
and end the 12yearold civil war 
kabul radio said tanai who became defense minister about 18 
months ago plotted with fundamentalist guerrilla leader gulbuddin 
hekmatyar such an alliance would one of convenience not ideology 
given tanais long advocacy of harsh methods against the guerrillas 
by linking tanai to hekmatyar the government may be trying to 
set the stage for the defense ministers final disgrace 
in recent months najib increasingly has presented hekmatyar as 
the personification of evil while depicting other guerrilla leaders 
and field commanders as more rational and welcome to join his 
sovietbacked government 
hekmatyar has become increasingly estranged from his fellow 
guerrilla leaders rejecting their political leadership and killing 
some of their followers 
najib has promoted tanai both in the government and communist 
party even though the general has a reputation for active 
opposition 
its become a familiar scenario since the party took control by 
coup and assassination in april 1978 give your enemies power in 
hopes of buying obedience then try to keep them from overthrowing 
you 
afghan sources from both sides of the party and civil war say 
tanai has been involved in at least the last three of five known 
coup attempts since najib became president in december 1986 the 
two most recent ones occurred in july and december 
tanai is from the party faction called khalq or masses and 
najib represents the parcham or flag faction parcham 
generally is less hawkish than khalq especially when it comes to 
making political overtures to the guerrillas 
najib loyalists say the president has begun an effort to change 
the party even its name to make it more acceptable to the 
insurgents the afghan people and such foreign critics as the 
united states the partys official name is the peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan 
such overtures generally have been lost on the islamic 
fundamentalist guerrillas who refuse to deal with a godless 
party 
tanai believed to be in his mid40s is known as a foe of any 
concessions to the insurgents or modification of the partys 
marxist origins najib recently has sought to portray the party as 
a defender of islam and champion of a freemarket economy 
the general comes from the tanai district near khost in southern 
afghanistan and takes his surname from his home region 
he is a member of the party politburo whose membership is said 
to be 14 tanai became defense minister sometime in 1988 but as 
often happens in afghanistan his appointment apparently was not 
announced 
when najib changed his cabinet in february 1989 after soviet 
military forces were withdrawn tanai remained in his post 
an afghan source in new delhi said travelers arriving in the 
indian capital monday reported that tanai had installed his 
ministry in the darulaman palace on kabuls southwestern outskirts 
and that it bristled with big guns and antennas 
he said the travelers spoke of widespread rumors in kabul over 
the weekend that tanai was planning a coup the source like the 
others spoke on condition of anonymity 
najibs official residence and office complex arg palace is in 
the heart of kabul both palaces were used by king zahir shah who 
was overthrown in 1973 by former prime minister mohammad daoud his 
cousin 
daoud was overthrown and killed in the 1978 coup that brought 
the communists to power

raymond buckey today pleaded innocent to 
eight revived charges in the mcmartin preschool molestation case 
during a hearing in which his lawyer made an extraordinary motion 
to halt dismissal of a sex count 
i am innocent your honor not guilty buckey told superior 
court judge stanley m weisberg the judge formally dismissed four 
unresolved charges against buckey and held in abeyance one 
contested charge 
defense attorney danny davis told the judge he wanted to keep in 
the case the allegation of sexual misconduct involving the son of 
judy johnson the mother whose complaints triggered the mcmartin 
preschool investigation 
it seems a little strange that the defense would be moving 
against a dismissal of a count but i am willing to hear the 
motion weisberg said an afternoon hearing was scheduled on the 
motion 
there were 13 counts unresolved by jurors in the mcmartin trial 
which lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than 10 
million jurors were leaning to acquittal on the charges involving 
the three youngsters in the new trial 
i dont know why theyre doing it buckey said outside 
court theyve got three of their weakest witnesses now im 
facing a minimcmartin trial 
the district attorney last month dropped a troublesome 
conspiracy count against buckey 31 
buckey spent nearly five years in jail without being convicted 
until his release on 15 million bail in february 1989 
when buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey finally came 
to trial in 1987 what had originally been hundreds of counts of 
child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared count of 
conspiracy and five other defendants had been dropped from the 
case the 41 children once said to have been abused came down to 11 
alleged victims

editors of four leading daily newspapers on 
tuesday criticized military censorship of reports about soviet 
immigration arguing the measure hurt israels image and violated 
press freedom 
their protest came a day after us state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler urged prime minister yitzhak shamir to reconsider 
the censorship order he issued friday 
the order which prohibited publication of how many immigrants 
arrived in february was announced last week after officials 
predicted up to 230000 soviets would arrive this year 
israeli officials said the restrictions that barred publication 
of figures and travel routes taken by soviet immigrants were needed 
for security reasons they cited recent arab protests about the 
influx and fears that immigrants might be attacked 
the army censor routinely reviews articles pertaining to 
military affairs before publication but coverage of immigration 
has rarely been applied 
editors and legal experts protested in newspaper editorials 
saying israeli leaders not journalists were to blame for the arab 
anger that followed shamirs suggestion israel needed occupied land 
to settle soviet immigrants 
moshe vardi editor of the masscirculation yediot ahronot 
daily accused the government of tarnishing israels image at a 
time when antidemocratic measures were increasingly unpopular 
in the free world and even beyond censorship is simply an 
incomprehensible term in 1990 it is a vestige of the past he 
wrote 
vardi and other editors sought a meeting with shamir they urged 
the government to seek an understanding with editors rather than 
impose blanket censorship on the soviet immigration story 
such an unwritten agreement existed during the 1984 airlift of 
ethiopian jews when selfcensorship kept the story secret for 
months 
other editors and legal experts questioned the government 
contention that the flow of soviet immigration was endangered by 
reports about how many were arriving 
the soviet union has not conditioned giving exit visas to 
keeping it secret so publicity to the immigration does not 
endanger it the liberal daily haaretz said 
the paper said the ban contravened the publics democratic right 
to know especially when israeli leaders have said citizens may 
have to pay more taxes to handle the influx of immigrants

prime minister toshiki kaifu told parliament on 
tuesday that japan must improve living standards to help ease trade 
frictions with the united states 
expensive housing high savings and poor public facilities have 
kept japanese living standards low and limited imports hindering 
reduction of the 49 billion us trade deficit with japan kaifu 
said 
our corporations are wealthy and strong but this wealth has 
come at the expense of long working hours and a low standard of 
living it is time to redress this imbalance he said 
responding to opposition questions in parliaments upper house 
kaifu urged lawmakers to cooperate in changing japans economic 
structure for the sake of the japanese people as well as to ease 
growing tension with the united states over trade imbalances 
we intend realistic efforts to carry out structural reforms 
that means we must carry out reforms of our land use policies and 
improve the standard of living he said 
actions by two cabinet members tuesday improved the chances for 
pledges made by kaifu at last weeks california summit with 
president bush 
minister of international trade and industry kabun muto ended 
opposition to changing a retail stores law that us officials say 
tends to prevent foreign firms from increasing sales in japan 
us trade negotiators and domestic business circles say the law 
hinders foreign retailers from opening outlets and slows the 
opening of large japanese stores that would more likely sell 
foreignmade goods 
ministry officials said they were considering changing or 
abolishing the law muto had told japanese reporters that bolder 
steps might have to be taken if easing its enforcement is not 
enough to satisfy the united states 
washington also says japan should provide more land for housing 
cut inflated real estate prices and spend more on roads parks and 
sewers to improve the general quality of life 
such spending is seen as likely to create more demand for 
foreign products while reducing the dependence of japans economy 
on exports 
meanwhile japans top defense official said tokyo would 
consider paying more for the 50000 us armed forces members in 
japan if the united states officially makes such a request 
but yozo ishikawa director general of the defense agency said 
at a news conference that he had heard nothing official about a 
statement on the matter by us defense secretary dick cheney in a 
television interview sunday 
cheney said he wants japan to assume 100 percent of the cost 
of maintaining us military bases in japan 
japan pays 24 billion of the estimated 6 billion annual cost 
of basing us forces in japan the defense agency says 
at their summit kaifu promised bush to do his best to carry out 
substantial reforms and increase japans contributions to regional 
security but he faces strong opposition from other parties 
kaifus opponents led by the socialists the no 1 opposition 
to his liberal democratic party dominate the upper house and are 
likely to obstruct action on trade and defenserelated issues 
the socialists and some other opposition parties oppose 
increasing defense spending and are highly critical of japans 
security relationship with the united states 
parliament also has been bogged down in battles over a bribery 
scandal and a new sales tax preventing debate on traderelated 
reforms in the past year 
kaifu is urging japan socialist party chairwoman takako doi and 
other opposition leaders to abandon their attacks on the sales tax 
given the comfortable majority his party won in feb 18 lower house 
elections to enable parliament to act on other pressing issues

the pomona valley quivered again tuesday 
as the number of measurable aftershocks from last weeks rumbling 
earthquake reached an estimated 400 to 500 
the aftershock at 1001 am measured 31 on the richter scale 
and was centered four miles northwest of upland said bob finn 
spokesman for seismologists at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena 
it was very mild said michael guerin spokesman for the 
state office of emergency services in ontario about five miles 
from the epicenter were at the point now where we dont even 
look up from our computers 
the feb 28 quake centered three miles northwest of upland 
measured 55 on the richter scale causing some minor injuries and 
more than 12 million in damage guerin said 
finn said that by midday tuesday seismometers had detected 400 
to 500 aftershocks but only about three dozen measured at least 
magnitude 23 large enough to be felt 
many people reported feeling what they thought was another quake 
early tuesday but finn said it was the sonic boom from an sr71 
blackbird spy plane looping over northern los angeles county the 
retired spy jet made a record 68minute flight from palmdale to its 
new home at the smithsonian institution in washington

lithuanias roman catholic cardinal was quoted 
tuesday as saying he hopes the soviet republic will achieve its 
independence by next year and that pope john paul ii will be the 
first visitor to the country 
in an interview in kaunas with the italian catholic daily 
avvenire cardinal vincentas sladkevicius suggested the pope could 
combine the trip with a planned return to his native poland which 
adjoins lithuania in june 1991 
he would be the first and most welcome guest of a free 
lithuania the cardinal was quoted as saying 
sladkevicius told the newspaper the church supports the cause of 
independence for the baltic republic with all its heart and 
urged western nations to do the same 
lithuania an independent country before world war ii was 
occupied by the soviet union in 1940 an estimated 25 million 
people or 80 percent of lithuanias population are roman 
catholics 
in elections last month lithuanians elected a legislature that 
is expected to push soviet authorities for independence this year 
the lithuanian communist party has also joined the call for 
independence 
john paul has disclosed that he twice had been barred from 
visiting lithuania at a meeting at the vatican in september 
president mikhail s gorbachev invited the pope to the soviet union 
but john paul made no commitment 
sladkevicius said if the pope were to go first to moscow and 
then to lithuania it would demonstrate that we are part of the 
soviet union i dont think john paul will do something like that 
there is another hypothesis the cardinal was quoted as 
saying if lithuania becomes independent soon lets say next 
year the pope could come here from warsaw combining the visit to 
lithuania with that planned for poland in june 1991

not to be outdone by mcdonalds time warner 
inc announced plans tuesday to open americanstyle 
multiplescreen movie theaters next year in moscow and leningrad 
where audiences will be allowed to eat popcorn in their seats for 
the first time 
the two ultramodern theaters are expected to open in late 1991 
at a cost of 28 million and will offer the soviet unions avid 
moviegoers a total of 19 new screens and 7400 new seats to enjoy 
popular foreign and domestic films us and soviet officials said 
the theaters will feature stateoftheart projection and dolby 
stereo sound systems computerized ticket booths concession stands 
in marble and neon lobbies restaurants souvenir shops and video 
game arcades with parking lots out front 
american popcorn a novelty to soviet audiences will be sold 
along with candy and soft drinks and in a break with soviet 
tradition moviegoers who formerly were required to consume 
refreshments at buffet counters in theater lobbies will be able to 
carry them to their seats in the new theaters 
hooray for hollywood and leningrad and moscow too said 
time warner president nj nicholas jr at a news conference at the 
soviet embassy where ambassador yuri dubinin toasted the healthy 
future of this sovietamerican child 
the project is a joint venture between time warner a worldwide 
publishing and entertainment conglomerate whose warner bros 
international theaters co subsidiary will own 60 percent of the 
theaters and the official soviet film agency vo sovexportfilm 
which will own 40 percent 
the announcement came less than two months after mcdonalds 
opened its first fastfood restaurant in the soviet capital jan 
31 serving an openingday record of 30000 meals to hungry 
muscovites 
plans for the two new theaters doubtless will be good news to 
soviet moviegoers who see an average of 14 films a year compared 
to the four seen by their american counterparts according to 
industry estimates 
theyll have every auditorium completely filled every hour of 
the day predicted jack valenti president of the motion picture 
association of america 
the largest of moscows more than 100 movie theaters the russia 
theater contains a 1200seat auditorium for feature films and a 
500seat room for documentaries 
by contrast the new warner multiplex in the soviet capital will 
boast 10 screens and 4000 seats it will be built on novokirovsky 
prospekt near a major railroad and subway terminal the leningrad 
theater also near a subway station will have nine screens and 
3400 seats 
oleg a rudnev the jowly bushybrowed general director of the 
soviet film agency said the new theaters will be free to show 
potentially controversial american movies such as the hunt for 
red october the newly released preglasnost tale of a soviet 
submarine commander who defects to the united states 
there is no censorship anymore rudnev said through an 
interpreter it is probably not possible to surprise the soviet 
viewer any longer 
time warner officials said ticket prices wont be decided until 
american films are testmarketed in moscow and leningrad to 
determine what soviet viewers are willing to pay 
embassy officials said movie tickets in moscow average about 50 
kopeks or eight cents under the unofficial exchange rate for 
foreign visitors prices are cheaper for matinees and more costly 
about 25 cents for lengthy popular feature films in more 
luxurious theaters

nelson mandela on tuesday brought 
his crusade for black majority rule in south africa to tanzania 
the home of thousands of exiled black compatriots 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress was 
met by former tanzanian president julius nyerere the first african 
leader to offer the anc guerrilla training camps outside of south 
africa 
how are you teacher mandela asked nyerere in swahili as he 
stepped off a special air zimbabwe flight from harare 
mandela and nyerere last met in early 1962 when mandela came to 
tanzania to ask the former president to establish training camps in 
this east african country 
thousands turned out at dar es salaams international airport 
and waited through an hourlong rainstorm to greet the 71yearold 
mandela who was freed from a south african prison four weeks ago 
as mandela emerged from his plane the crowd raised a roar of 
viva anc after inspecting an honor guard mandela was escorted 
to a group of exiled anc members 
i am so glad i have seen him at last said a bearded south 
african who refused to give his name but said he had fled his 
country in 1964 
mandela was to address a rally in dar es salaam and fly to 
zanzibar an island republic of tanzania on wednesday and visit 
the anc camps about 100 miles west of dar es salaam on thursday 
he planned to address many of the 3000 anc exiles who live in 
tanzania most are due to return home by the end of this year 
before ending his threeday stay in zimbabwe mandela said he 
had learned a lesson 
zimbabwes reconciliation is an experience from which we want 
to profit mandela said referring to president robert mugabes 
policy of reconciliation between whites and blacks 
until independence from britain 10 years ago zimbabwe was the 
whiteruled colony of rhodesia but after a sevenyear guerrilla 
war the black majority assumed power under mugabe 
mandela views zimbabwe as a role model for his own country 
where 5 million whites wield economic and political power over 28 
million voteless blacks 
the anc leader said he wanted to discuss ways of steering the 
country towards black majority rule with all political movements in 
south africa including the rival panafricanist congress 
on whites demands for guarantees for their future mandela said 
the anc was still examining the question but hoped to allay the 
minoritys fears 
mandela was freed from 27 years imprisonment on feb 11 by 
president fw de klerk after the anc the pac and the south 
african communist party were legitimized for the first time in 30 
years 
the release heralded the beginning of negotiations between the 
whiterun government and antiapartheid movements towards a new 
political framework 
mandela is expected to hold his first talks with de klerk this 
month after returning from sweden

japan successfully tested one of the worlds most 
advanced rocket engines tuesday and officials said the engine will 
have the capability to launch large sophisticated satellites 
the le7 engine burned normally during a foursecond firing 
test the national space development agency said the sophisticated 
engine is to power the first stage of a new japanese rocket the 
h2 on which japan has pinned many of its hopes for future space 
exploration 
the current mainstay of the japanese space program the h1 
rocket can lift only 1210 pounds into geostationary orbit making 
it incapable of launching large sophisticated communications 
satellites 
development of the japanesedesigned h2 also will also free 
japan from us veto power over commercial launches of 
thirdcountry satellites imposed as a licensing condition for us 
technology used in previous japanese rockets 
the h2 is slated to go into service in march 1992 and will 
match the twoton geostationary payload capabilities of current 
us soviet and european rockets 
the le7 engine powered by liquid hydrogen and oxygen uses a 
hightechnology propulsion system similar to that on the us space 
shuttle 
tuesdays success followed a string of development problems that 
technicians attributed to the extremely high stresses inside the 
highperformance engine 
the first stage of the current h1 rocket is based on 
25yearold us delta rocket technology licensed from mcdonnell 
douglas but the second stage is designed in japan and also will be 
used as the second stage of the h2 
mcdonnell douglas officials recently asked mitsubishi heavy 
industries to supply it with the new second stage to update the 
delta rocket japanese officials say 
on feb 22 a european ariane 44l rocket carrying two japanese 
communications satellites exploded shortly after liftoff 
destroying both satellites reportedly worth 600 million analysts 
say the accident is likely to further encourage japan to develop 
its own space capabilities 
despite a late start due in part to a postworld war ii ban by 
us occupation authorities and low budgets japans space program 
has progressed steadily and achieved an enviable success record 
a japanese satellite musesa is due to reach the moon on march 
18 making japan the third nation after the soviet union and the 
united states to reach earths closest neighbor

wall streets watchdog the securities and 
exchange commission said tuesday that it wants to help advise the 
emerging free economies of eastern europe on how to keep their 
infant stock markets orderly and honest 
sec chairman richard c breeden who met recently with 
highlevel financial officials from the soviet union hungary and 
poland said the agency would form an advisory committee on 
emerging securities markets in eastern europe 
the secs expertise in this area hopefully can assist in a 
successful transition to efficient private capital markets with 
necessary oversight and supervision breeden said 
the committee will recommend what action the sec and the 
financial industry can take to help create organized securities 
markets in eastern europe and the soviet union 
breeden said there is no more fitting manner for the united 
states to aid the process of economic development in eastern 
europe and in the soviet union than by assisting in the creation of 
free capital markets in these countries 
breeden and other sec officials met feb 21 with a highlevel 
delegation from the soviet government that was reviewing the 
operation of us banking and securities markets 
breeden has held similar meetings with delegations from poland 
and hungary including one with president bush and the leader of an 
effort to expand the small hungarian securities exchange 
the sec anticipates eventually receiving additional requests for 
assistance from several other governments in creating securities 
markets 
no one has been named to the panel but sec officials hope to 
include leaders of us securities companies other financial firms 
and senior representatives of selfregulatory organizations such as 
securities exchanges 
breeden said he hoped the advisory committees first meeting 
could be held in april

the pentagon increased its stockpile of 
unrequired spare parts and supplies by 4 billion over three years 
creating a system that is like opening the door to imelda marcos 
closet a lawmaker said tuesday 
the general accounting office released three reports describing 
widespread problems in the defense departments management of its 
103 billion supply system including excessive purchases of 
unnecessary items and storage space devoted to obsolete items 
officials from the gao the investigative arm of congress told 
the senate governmental affairs committee that in 1987 the 
department had a 30 billion inventory of unrequired items three 
years later the stockpile costs 34 billion 
the gao said it based its report on pentagon estimates 
although we found no dominant reason that caused inventory 
growth we believe the growth results from a tendency to stock far 
into the future said frank c conahan assistant comptroller 
general this is fostered by a management philosophy that rewards 
obligating funds and filling orders 
there is no corresponding emphasis on economy or efficiency 
he said 
deputy defense secretary donald j atwood told the senate panel 
the pentagon has moved to implement reforms proposed in last years 
defense management review 
if the eastern bloc nations could turn toward democracy in a 
single year said atwood i dont see why we cant reform the 
defense department 
according to the gao the navy had 53 reactor assemblies for a 
sonar system but 51 of them totaling 160000 were not needed 
the agency said neither the navys item manager nor the branch 
chief had records or knew why the items were unrequired 
by definition required items are supplies for future wars and 
two years or more of peacetime operations unrequired are those 
beyond the necessary stockpile 
the gao also found an inventory manager increased the 
requirement for shirts from a sixmonth supply to a fiveyear 
supply the defense logistics agency later found itself with 
379000 shirts and 1078000 on order when the requirement only 
called for 424000 
the excess totaled a sevenyear supply for 87 million 
the reports prompted outrage from members of the senate panel 
looking into the pentagon supply system is like opening the 
door to imelda marcos closet you see excess staggering 
excess said sen carl levin dmich referring to the former 
first lady of the philippines known for her buying sprees 
the defense departments tens of billions of dollars in 
unrequired inventories unwisely purchased during the reagan years 
continue to grow said sen john glenn dohio chairman of the 
senate panel 
its warehouses are gorged with the overflow and are filled 
beyond capacity 
the gao also warned the problem may be worse than their 
estimates because it found a number of cases where the pentagon 
added or planned to add unnecessary requirements for supplies

the new military rulers of the 
ciskei homeland declared a state of emergency tuesday in a bid to 
end looting and rioting following their coup that has left 27 
people dead and 550 injured 
there were reports of more looting despite the presence of south 
african troops who were sent in to quell the violence at the 
request of the new rulers in ciskei 
dissident army officers led by brig gen oupa gqozo staged a 
bloodless coup sunday that ousted ciskeis president lennox sebe 
while he was in hong kong on a trade mission 
ciskei a 3600squaremile territory of about 1 million people 
on the indian ocean coast is one of 10 black homelands in south 
africa they are recognized only by the pretoria government 
south africa established the homelands in the 1960s to try to 
create separate tribalbased states for blacks while whites retain 
control of national politics and the economy 
looting and rioting erupted sunday evening and more than 50 
stores and factories many owned by israelis and taiwanese have 
been destroyed 
doctors at hospitals in ciskei and nearby east london in south 
africa said 27 people had been killed and more than 550 injured in 
violence following the coup most of the dead and injured suffered 
gunshot and stabbing wounds the doctors said 
the military rulers announced the state of emergency tuesday 
evening gqozo told the staterun south african broadcasting corp 
that his government had begun to release political prisoners held 
by sebe and he said the new government would investigate charges 
of corruption against the ousted president 
human rights groups say sebes government detained hundreds of 
dissidents 
south african foreign minister pik botha speaking to parliament 
in cape town said additional south african troops had been moved 
into the area as a reserve force 
south africas proapartheid conservative party criticized the 
south african government for not intervening sooner in ciskei to 
prevent the chaos 
these little stonethrowing looting arsonist criminals are 
probably a precursor to the new south africa said tom langley a 
member of parliament for the conservatives 
botha said he was informed friday of a possible coup attempt in 
ciskei and passed the information on to sebe who ignored it and 
left for hong kong the same day 
the deposed president apparently did not inform his wife who 
remained at the official residence in ciskei she was taken from 
the residence tuesday in a car bearing south african diplomatic 
license plates 
sebe meanwhile was expected to return wednesday to south 
africa his plans were unclear but it appeared doubtful he would 
try to return to ciskei 
south africa has neither formally recognized the new military 
rulers nor given any indication that it opposes them the south 
africans recognize the military government in the neighboring 
transkei homeland that came to power in a 1987 coup 
the coup appears to have wide support in ciskei many residents 
opposed sebe and considered his rule oppressive and corrupt 
but the jubilation over the coup quickly turned violent as 
drunken mobs rampaged in several towns 
it was a drunken orgy of violence dozens of buildings 
were gutted said journalist louise flanagan 
gqozo received a rousing cheer monday when he told thousands of 
people at a stadium in bisho that the african national congress and 
other antiapartheid groups would be free to engage in political 
activity in ciskei 
the anc is the main black group fighting south africas 
whiterun government south african president fw de klerk 
legalized the anc last month but some homeland leaders do not 
allow the group to operate in the territories they control 
gqozo said he would like to see ciskei relinquish its nominal 
independence and return to south africa the transkei homeland is 
considering a similar plan the south african government has not 
taken a position on homelands that want to return to south africa

the government of chad continues to detain torture 
and summarily execute political prisoners despite the adoption of a 
new constitution guaranteeing human rights amnesty international 
said wednesday 
president hissene habre has direct knowledge of some of the 
abuses and many of the several hundred political detainees had 
been held within 50 yards of the presidential office the human 
rights organization said 
chad has been a catalogue of horror since habre gained power 
in 1982 said amnesty international representative jamal benomar 
speaking at a news conference tuesday he said habres government 
had refused to respond to amnesty internationals allegations and 
refused to disclose any information about the fate of political 
prisoners 
the authorities have never admitted that these detainees 
exist benomar said 
according to the amnesty international report some prisoners 
were arbitrarily detained because they belonged to a particular 
ethnic group suspected of antigovernment activities others were 
detained solely because of relatives activities the report said 
in december the government adopted a new constitution that 
guarantees basic individual rights as well as freedom of speech 
and assembly but amnesty international said there had been no 
perceptible change in the governments treatment of political 
prisoners 
benomar said torture of political prisoners in chad has become 
routine with increasing use of electric shocks women prisoners 
have been forced by soldiers to serve as slaves and prostitutes 
the report said 
prisoners are held incommunicado and denied medical 
attention the report said no one sees the detainees except 
the security personnel guarding and interrogating them 
habre became president in 1982 after driving a libyanbacked 
rival out of the capital ndjamena during a civil war in 
december his government claimed voters in a referendum gave 
overwhelming approval to the new constitution and to a new 
sevenyear term for habre 
he said the election introduced chad to an era of democracy 
but has allowed no opposition political activity 
benomar said some opponents of the government have crossed the 
border into sudan and are taking up arms against habre

the bush administration and fellow congressmen 
on tuesday lauded a plan by rep john lewis dga to designate 
the route of the 1965 selmatomontgomery voting rights march as a 
national historic trail 
three weeks before the march 1965 protest lewis led a group of 
525 demonstrators onto the edmund pettys bridge in selma ala for 
a planned march to montgomery 
the group was attacked by state troopers lewis was severely 
beaten television accounts of the attack brought thousands of 
people to selma for the subsequent march which resulted in 
congressional passage of the voting rights act 
testifying for the bill herbert cables deputy director of the 
national park service told the house interior subcommittee on 
national parks and public lands the fact that citizens shed 
their blood to demonstrate their right to vote should never be 
orgotten 
cables told lewis the nation owes him a debt of gratitude 
for what you did 25 years ago 
the park service official said the adminstration supports lewis 
bill to authorize a oneyear study to determine if the march route 
qualifies for designation as a national historic trail 
edwin bearss chief historian of the park service said the 
agency normally will not consider a historic designation until 50 
years after an event but the selma to montgomery march he said 
is transcendental 
lewis said designation of the march route as a national historic 
trail would serve as a reminder of the right and responsibility 
to vote and will recognize the sacrifices of those who fought to 
ensure that right for all americans 
congress may have passed the voting rights act he said 
but the law was written by the marchers on the road from selma to 
montgomery

the military approved plans in 
1985 for undercover agents to go abroad to disrupt operations of 
the exiled african national congress guerrilla movement an army 
general testified tuesday 
maj gen joep joubert said the proposal was approved by magnus 
malan who has been defense minister since 1980 however joubert 
did not specify any actions that have been carried out in the past 
five years 
several prominent anc officials outside south africa have been 
assassinated or have had attempts on their lives in recent years 
the anc the main group fighting the whiterun government was 
legalized last month by president fw de klerk it has offices in 
more than 30 countries but most of its estimated 15000 exiled 
members are expected to begin returning to south africa shortly 
joubert testified on the second day of a judicial inquiry into 
allegations that the military and police participated in death 
squads 
much of the testimony has focused on a shadowy military unit 
known as the civil cooperation bureau which south african police 
say they suspect of involvement in the killing of government 
opponents 
the bureau which employed former police officers and other 
civilians was set up to carry out operations that could not be 
traced to the military or the government according to other 
generals who testified tuesday 
malan said monday he didnt know until november 1989 that the 
bureau existed 
activists meanwhile have alleged that the police and military 
have been involved in the unsolved killings of some 60 activists in 
the past decade 
maj gen jan klopper testified that the civil cooperation 
bureau grew out of other covert units and was formally established 
in 1986 
the military has said the secret bureau had 139 members an 
annual budget of 11 million and was engaged in highly sensitive 
intelligence gathering operations in south africa and abroad 
yet top military and government officials have claimed they had 
no knowledge of the bureau until recently 
de klerk and deputy defense minister wynand breytenbach have 
said they learned of the units existence in january 
meanwhile anglican archbishop desmond tutu responded with humor 
tuesday following revelations that the bureau had planned to send 
him a baboon fetus 
we used to think soldiers in the bush were looking for 
socalled terrorists said tutu but he added all they were 
looking for was pregnant baboons 
gen rudolph badenhorst head of military intelligence 
testified monday about the baboon plot but said he didnt know the 
reason for the plan which was never carried out 
badenhorst acknowledged that the civil cooperation bureau blew 
up a pretoria store owned by an antiapartheid activist and bombed 
a community hall in a mixedrace township near cape town 
no military officers have been charged in connections with the 
activities of the bureau but two men have been detained for 
questioning and police are searching for several others

communist party general secretary jiang zemin 
will travel to north korea in midmarch in his first trip outside 
china since assuming his office in june it was reported tuesday 
jiang will make the goodwill visit at the invitation of north 
korean president kim il sung according to the official xinhua news 
agency 
jiangs visit accentuates the close ties between the two 
hardline communist states particularly at a time when north 
korean relations with its other main ally the soviet union have 
been strained by soviet reforms and ideological changes 
north korea also needs to bolster its ties with china as east 
european nations and the soviet union move toward official 
relations with south korea 
china does 3 billion us dollars worth of annual trade with the 
south and sanctions nonofficial ties but insists it will not

christian warlord samir geagea said 
tuesday he believes the latest truce in his confrontation with 
renegade gen michel aoun will endure 
nothing can be solved by war i think this ceasefire will 
hold said geagea who was interviewed at a forward militia 
command post in jounieh north of beirut 
the truce began friday and ended more than a month of fighting 
between lebanons two top christian leaders that left 750 dead and 
2088 wounded 
geagea said the vatican and france were instrumental in 
convincing aoun to accept the truce 
he said french and vatican officials said they would not hinder 
a syrian military intervention if aoun did not end the 
intrachristian fighting 
they told gen aoun if you want to continue the war in east 
beirut we shall consider ourselves unconcerned with whats 
happening and we believe big events could happen as a result 
geagea said 
the ceasefire was called by maronite catholic patriarch 
nasrallah sfeir 
sfeir had threatened to excommunicate aoun geagea and their 
followers if they did not stop the shooting 
aoun and geagea are maronites the christian sect that has 
dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943 
aoun initiated the intrachristian confrontation by demanding 
the disbanding of geageas lebanese forces the main military 
challenge to his claim as sole authority in the christian enclave 
but tuesday geagea again said merging his lebanese forces with 
aouns army is out of the question 
only when the civil war ends and a strong state based on 
certain foundations emerges will that happen we shall then be the 
first to disband our militia he added 
geagea said his forces have had contacts with us officials and 
that iraq helped mediate between his militia and aouns army 
through its embassy in east beirut 
iraq syrias main arab foe was aouns primary backer during 
the generals failed sixmonth war of liberation to evict the 
syrians last year it was also a major arms supplier for the 
militia 
geagea refused to clearly state whether he recognized the 
syrianallied government of president elias hrawi hrawi was 
elected in november in line with an arabbrokered peace accord to 
end lebanons 15yearold war civil war 
aoun has rejected the peace pact and the government of hrawi 
which dismissed aoun as army commander aoun has criticized the 
peace plan for not laying out a timetable for a complete withdrawal 
of syrian forces 
syria has 40000 troops in about 70 percent of lebanon 
geagea refused to take a clear position on the lebanese peace 
pact 
there are good things in it and bad things he said without 
elaboration 
hrawi is on a tour of arab states for talks on ending the bloody 
intrachristian dispute and to push through the lebanese peace pact 
he left saudi arabia for algeria monday ending two days of 
talks with king fahd who promised military aid sources said

president bush on tuesday named assistant 
treasury secretary salvatore r martoche as acting director of the 
the office of thrift supervision the agency that regulates the 
nations savings and loan institutions 
martoche immediately promised to provide stability and 
leadership to the governments oversight of the troubled sampl 
industry 
the interim appointment fills the vacancy created by the 
resignation last december of m danny wall who quit under 
criticism from members of congress for his handling of the sampl 
crisis in his 2year tenure 
martoche a former us attorney from buffalo was named by bush 
to serve until a new director is in place 
administration officials said the search for a permanent 
successor to wall is continuing sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the treasury department planned to forward its 
recommendation within several days 
congressional democrats have been pointing to the bush 
administrations failure to recruit a permanent successor to wall 
as evidence that the sampl bailout was falling into disarray 
because the martoche appointment is an interim one it does not 
require senate confirmation 
when speculation surfaced that jonathan fiechter senior deputy 
in charge of policy at the agency might be named as interim 
director sampl industry officials raised questions over the legality 
of any actions taken by an acting director who was not confirmed by 
the senate 
martoches appointment was expected to alleviate that problem 
because he has already been through the confirmation process in his 
current treasury post 
martoche said in a statement he would seek to provide 
stability and leadership to the agency during the transition he 
also said he would appoint fiechter as his principal deputy 
director 
martoche takes over the reins of the agency overseeing the 
restructuring of the troubled sampl industry and will preside over a 
growing list of lawsuits against savings industry executives 
accused of illegal lending practices 
wall criticized in congress for underestimating the sampl crisis 
and acting slowly against the californiabased lincoln savings and 
loan association announced dec 4 he would resign as soon as the 
administration found a replacement 
however as the months passed wall indicated he was anxious to 
leave soon 
martoche is currently assistant secretary of the treasury for 
enforcement overseeing the secret service the customs service and 
the agencys drugintervention programs 
the office of thrift supervision formerly known as the federal 
home loan bank board was extensively overhauled last year as part 
of the 10year 150 billion sampl rescue legislation 
the measure placed the agency under the control of the treasury 
department and removed many of its previous powers under the 
legislation a new agency the resolution trust corp is charged 
with selling or closing hundreds of insolving sampl associations 
at the time of his resignation wall denounced a steady stream 
of onesided information from congressional hearings on the 
collapse of lincoln rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of 
the house banking committee wrapped up his investigation of 
lincoln tuesday 
gonzalez in a statement said he was encouraged bush had named 
an acting director but criticized him for waiting so long and for 
leaving other regulatory positions vacant 
leaving a resigned and discredited director in office in a 
lameduck status for three months has been extremely poor public 
policy that has struck at the heart of the agencys morale he 
said

the united states wants early talks with the 
soviet union on reports that soviet mediumrange missiles remain in 
east germany in apparent violation of the 1987 treaty banning such 
weapons the state department said monday 
margaret tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said the 
united states wants to learn if the weapons sighted in east germany 
last week were prohibited ss23 missiles and missile launchers 
at this point we do not want to speculate on what we may or 
may not find ms tutwiler said 
we expect to discuss this subject with the soviets at a very 
early date she said adding the time and place have yet to be 
set 
the washington times in its tuesday editions quoted unnamed bush 
administration officials as saying us army officers traveling 
through east germany photographed six ss23 launchers and a dozen 
missiles 
the newspaper quoted administration missiles as saying existence 
of ss23 missiles in east germany would violate the intermediate 
nuclear forces or inf treaty 
they said presence of the missiles in east germany would 
complicate negotiations to reduce us and soviet strategic 
intercontinental missiles because new doubts would be raised about 
verifying soviet compliance 
under the terms of the treaty the soviet union was to dismantle 
all of its declared 239 ss23 launchers and 108 ss23 missiles

workers at the three mile island nuclear 
plant began shutting down the unit 1 reactor tuesday after plant 
monitors detected higherthannormal amounts of radioactivity being 
vented into the atmosphere 
state federal and plant officials said there was no danger to 
the public the releases were not detected by radiation monitors 
located off the island which is about 10 miles south of harrisburg 
also tuesday the unit 3 reactor at the peach bottom nuclear 
power plant in york county near the maryland border was shut down 
because of a mechanical problem with the systems generator 
officials said unit 2 had been shut down last week for maintenance 
gpu nuclear corp which operates tmi said officials believe 
the problem stemmed from a small water leak between the nuclear and 
nonnuclear sides of the plant under federal license requirements 
tmi must shut down if there is a confirmed leak of more than 6 
gallons per hour 
although the leak appeared to be at a rate of 1 gallon per 
minute gpu officials said they decided to immediately shut down 
the plant instead of going through a process to confirm the actual 
rate the plant could have continued to operate until the leak was 
confirmed to be 6 gallons per hour they said 
the shutdown is a precautionary measure and no emergency 
condition exists said mary wells a gpu spokeswoman 
the higherthannormal levels of radiation were detected by a 
monitor in the plants steam system radiation left the plant 
through a vent on that system 
doug bedell a gpu spokesman said only a fraction of one 
millirem of radiation was released over a threehour period he 
said a chest xray would equal about 10 millirems of radiation a 
millirem is a unit of measurement 
karl abraham a spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission 
said the leak at tmi at a rate of about 1 gallon per minute was 
detected shortly before 830 am 
workers began shutting the reactor down shortly after 9 am 
plant officials said 
susan woods a spokeswoman for the state department of 
environmental resources said the agency had not detected any 
abovenormal radiation levels offsite 
the plant is going into normal shutdown they are doing it 
manually she said if there was a serious problem it would 
have automatically shut down 
the plant had been operating at 75 percent capacity it was 
recently out of service for two months for maintenance and to 
replenish its nuclear fuel 
we dont know when it will be up again bedell said we 
need to determine the nature and source of these leaks before we 
would consider starting up the plant 
tmi 1s sister plant unit 2 was the site of the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident in 1979 a combination of human and 
mechanical errors led to the draining of protective cooling water 
from the plants radioactive gases were released into the 
atmosphere unit 1 was undamaged in the accident 
a spokesman for philadelphia electric co which owns peach 
bottom did not immediately return a phone call for comment

president francois mitterrand on monday told 
czechoslovakias leading lawmaker alexander dubcek that an 
international accord is needed to assure that a unified germany 
would not seek to regain prewar land 
a french official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity 
said the french president would repeat the position friday when 
polish president wojciech jaruzelkski and prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki make a oneday visit to discuss the issue 
west german chancellor helmut kohl is being criticized 
increasingly for refusing to guarantee that the current border 
between poland and east germany known as the oderneisse line 
would be kept by a united germany 
kohl says such a commitment can only be made by a united german 
parliament but he appears to be under pressure from rightists who 
want to reclaim territory lost to poland after world war ii 
dubcek was czechoslovakias communist leader during the prague 
spring reform movement of 1968 which soviet troops crushed he 
returned to public life as speaker of the federal assembly late 
last year after the peaceful revolution that forced the communists 
to give up their monopoly on power 
the country replaced its hardline communist government with one 
acceptable to the opposition and elected former dissident 
playwright vaclav havel as president 
dubceks twoday visit to paris continues tuesday with meetings 
with premier michel rocard and national assembly speaker laurent 
fabius and a news conference 
the french official briefing reporters said dubcek told 
mitterrand that czechoslovakia does not oppose german reunification

the opposition will have access to state 
broadcast media during election campaigns the national assembly 
announced tuesday amid preparations for the first free balloting 
in more than four decades 
lawmakers adopted a new statute for radio and television which 
is responsible to the legislature and no longer to the government 
but it was unclear whether the measure would grant the broadcast 
media more independence 
in a marked departure from the past when state radio and 
television reflected the official view the statute specified 
commentaries on radio and television represent the personal 
opinion of the commentators 
communists in bulgaria unlike those in other soviet bloc 
countries have retained much of their clout in national politics 
legislative elections are scheduled for june the first after 45 
years of hardline communist rule 
the duration of the election messages and other details were to 
be included in an electoral law which was among key legislation 
held up by the suspension on feb 12 of talks between the ruling 
communists and the opposition the talks broke down over the 
communists refusal to agree on key political reforms 
on monday the legislature enacted a law restoring the names of 
the 15 million ethnic turks and other moslems forced to adopt 
bulgarian names in an assimilation campaign authored by the 
communists 
legislators said the media statute was modeled after similar 
legislation in several west european countries it stipulates that 
radio and television must be objective they must not serve one 
party or group 
according to the new law the broadcast media will be controlled 
by a committee of eight legislators and seven other leaders 
the heads of state radio and television will be proposed by the 
government and elected by the legislature they cannot hold senior 
posts within political parties workers in the media are not 
entitled to engage in political activity the statute said 
the law also stipulated the state council president the head of 
the legislature and the prime minister should be given immediate 
access to radio and tv on demand

a storm moving out of the rockies and onto the plains blasted 
wyoming and colorado with heavy wet snow tuesday closing schools 
and hundreds of miles of highway and shutting down the wyoming 
legislature 
wyomings laramie range near granite mountain had picked up 3 to 
4 feet of snow and some mountain areas in colorado got up to 2 feet 
overnight earlier the storm left 22 inches at snowbird utah 
ahead of the advancing snow freezing rain brought down power 
lines in western nebraska new mexico and western south dakota got 
snow and kansas had strong thunderstorms 
jack daseler a meteorologist at the national weather service in 
cheyenne wyo described the conditions responsible for the storm 
as a classic combining an upper level weather system near the 
four corners area where colorado utah arizona and new mexico 
meet and a surface system in southeastern colorado 
he said that during the night the upper and lower system will 
coincide over eastcentral colorado and sit there for 12 hours 
he predicted total accumulations of 15 to 18 inches in wyomings 
lower elevations cheyenne had more than a foot by noon and 
wheatland had 18 inches 
pinewood springs colo in the foothills seven miles southwest 
of loveland reported 24 inches of fresh snow and buckhorn mountain 
west of fort collins received 22 inches in new mexico 9 inches of 
snow had fallen by late morning at chama and brazos lodge 
heavy snow hampered rescue efforts after a bank explosion at 
crested butte colo and delayed the arrival of ambulances from 
gunnison officials said 
wyoming legislators decided to take a day off from their budget 
session as the snow deepened outside and blowing snow made 
buildings just a block away in cheyenne start to fade out about 
4000 state employees were told to stay home and at least 400 miles 
of interstate highways were closed 
getting people home tonight is the concernsaid senate 
majority leader diemer true we could get staff and legislators 
here but getting them home tonight is the problem 
neither house speaker bill mcilvain with 18 years in the 
legislature nor senate president russell zimmer a 16year member 
could remember the legislature ever closing because of the weather 
children in cheyenne and laramie got the day off and the 
university of wyoming in laramie canceled classes at 11 am 
theyre calling for another foot university spokesman bill 
young said 
the university of wyomings cowboys were stranded in laramie by 
road closures that kept them from making their flight from denver 
to the western athletic conference basketball tournament in el 
paso texas 
rodney barkell manager at a 7eleven store in cheyenne said he 
had almost no business what we mostly get right now is walkins 
people that are close enough to where they can walk to the 
store 
and some of those who did take their cars may have regretted it 
weve had a bunch of people stuck in our parking lot he said 
barkell added that he was 1 hours late for work himself and he 
only lives a mile away i got stuck trying to get out of my 
house and a friend of mine tried to pull me out and he got stuck 
too barkell explained 
the wyoming highway patrol closed some 200 miles of interstate 
80 from the nebraska line west to walcott junction and about 150 
miles of interstate 25 from the colorado line north to orin 
junction 
the closures piled up business at truck stops in cheyenne 
were jammed said richard fox general manager of little 
america in cheyenne everything is full the truck parking lot is 
jammed with trucks and all of our motel rooms are rented we 
probably have a couple of hundred people waiting around the coffee 
shop and lobby 
in northern colorado interstate 25 was closed by heavy snow 
from north of wellington to the wyoming line the colorado state 
patrol also closed highway 287 from fort collins to laramie wyo

an experiment on the london subway to remove 
graffiti quickly from trains stations and other buildings is 
producing good results the system said tuesday 
we found that attacks increased for a time when the vandals 
were faced day after day with clean surfaces but then the number 
of attacks fell away said spokesman john reed of london 
underground 
we think the vandals get tired of seeing their individual 
trademarks cleaned off and cant be bothered to keep going back to 
renew their scribbles he said 
london underground operates the 237mile system and its 268 
stations which londoners call the tube 
removing graffiti from trains stations and other buildings on 
the subway costs more than 32 million a year and some stations 
suffer as many as 700 attacks a month 
a cleaning company specializing in graffiti removal was hired in 
august on a 656000 oneyear contract to work on a group of 15 
stations at the northern end of the metropolitan line its cleaners 
aimed to get rid of the daubing within 10 hours of staff reporting 
attacks 
the cleaned surfaces are then treated with easytoclean paint 
and lacquer 
reed said vandals travel from all over britain and even from 
overseas to daub the subway 
some of them like to show they diced with death by crossing 
electrified tracks and climbing up to bridges and other structures 
to leave their personal logos reed said 
the experiment includes photographing each graffiti attack and 
passing details to the transport police in an attempt to identify 
individual vandals but that aspect has only just been publicized 
staff morale at the cleanedup stations has improved and some 
of the staff have asked to restart gardens which used to brighten 
up our surface stations we are also getting letters of thanks from 
passengers reed said 
mike scanes managing director of the firm with the cleanup 
contract graffiti management said graffiti is a social problem 
which should be tackled by schools and parents it amazes me that 
any parent can let a child play on a tube line carrying 650 volts

six republican lawmakers on tuesday urged 
renewal of the drive for a constitutional amendment to outlaw 
burning the american flag saying the statutory ban passed last 
year appears certain to be overturned in the courts 
maybe it doesnt bother people around here a lot but out 
there in the real world theyre ready for a constitutional 
amendment senate minority leader bob dole rkan told a news 
conference 
a us district court in the nations capital ruled monday that 
the statutory ban on burning the american flag approved by congress 
last year is not a constitutional way to limit free speech a 
federal court in seattle issued a similar ruling last month 
the justice department said tuesday that it would appeal the 
rulings but the republican lawmakers said it appeared probable 
that the supreme court would uphold the decisions and throw out the 
statutory ban 
congressional sponsors of the measure offered it last year as an 
alternative to a constitutional amendment they said that imposing 
the ban with a statute was better than adding restrictions through 
changes in the document that guarantees americans freedom of speech 
the sponsors sought to avoid language that singled out 
protesters 
instead they fashioned what they called a simple content 
neutral ban on destruction of the flag which they said had 
nothing to do with freedom of speech they hoped in this way to 
survive a court challenge to the legislation 
the republican lawmakers reminded the news conference that some 
of them had warned last year that the courts would not uphold the 
statutory ban they said americans will demand a constitutional 
amendment to settle the issue once and for all 
i dont think theres anything thats going to get our 
american people more excited than a bunch of jerks out there 
trampling on the american flag and stamping on it declared sen 
orrin hatch rutah 
sen strom thurmond rsc said support within the senate is 
now sufficient to pass an amendment also at the session were sens 
john mccain rariz and chuck grassley riowa as well as rep

slovakia the eastern part of czechoslovakia has traditionally 
been a stronghold of orthodox communism and the new reform 
movement that broke the marxists hold on the country appears 
stronger in the czech lands and particularly in prague 
czechs outnumber slovaks approximately twotoone in the 
country which has a population of about 155 million people 
the national council slovakias parliament recently passed a 
controversial proposal that would change the countrys name to the 
federation czechoslovakia an attempt to stress the equal 
status of both nations within the country 
the proposal would have to be approved by the federal 
parliament and passage is unlikely 
the move was considered by many moderate slovaks to be an 
unnecessary challenge to the czech part of the country that could 
inflame passions between the two groups 
there have been charges that communist deputies a minority in 
the 150member national council had actively lobbied the majority 
independent legislators to support the proposal 
jan buday leader of the public against violence opposition 
group that played the key role in slovakias peaceful uprising 
against communist rule accused communists of attempting to spread 
discord in slovakia by inflaming historic tensions between slovaks 
and the ethnic hungarian minority 
buday whose name sounds hungarian but who says he is a slovak 
accused the communists of spreading rumors that he was hungarian 
and trying to impose that groups ethnic interests on slovaks 
i am first of all a citizen and also a slovak of the kind who 
does not have to be racist or chauvinist buday said

chancellor helmut kohl dropped his 
demand for polish concessions on a border treaty and moved closer 
tuesday to guaranteeing a united germany would not claim land ceded 
to poland after world war ii 
his government proposed a parliamentary resolution to be 
introduced thursday saying a united germany should sign a treaty 
with poland declaring that the right of poles to live in secure 
borders will not now or in the future be questioned by us germans 
after a cabinet meeting where ministers discussed disagreements 
over his handling of the border issue kohl said the things that 
burdened us are cleared away 
in warsaw the polish foreign ministry said there had been 
clear progress but talks were needed about a border treaty 
mikhail s gorbachev welcomed the corrections in kohls 
position the soviet news agency tass quoted the soviet president 
as saying after meeting in moscow with hans modrow the communist 
premier of east germany 
kohl had been criticized for his reluctance to state clearly 
presumably in an effort to preserve the conservative vote in 
ecember elections that a reunified germany would not question 
polands western border 
he had insisted repeatedly that only the leadership of a united 
germany could make such a promise about polish territory roughly 
onethird of which was part of germany before the war 
the chancellors pronouncements caused unease in poland the 
soviet union united states and elsewhere as kohl sought 
international support for bringing east and west germany together 
into a single nation 
his statements also created trouble at home the free democrats 
his coalition partners joined the opposition social democrats in 
saying his position jeopardized the chances of unification 
on friday he exacerbated the problem by demanding that any 
treaty recognizing polands current borders be linked to pledges by 
the poles to honor a 1953 decision to waive any war reparations 
and to a renewal of polands 1989 promise to guarantee the rights 
of its german minority 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and his free democrats 
agreed with poland that kohl must clarify his position on the 
sensitive border issue 
after a meeting tuesday between kohl and genscher their second 
in two days free democrat official torsten wolfgramm said the 
chancellor had abandoned his demand that polish assurances 
accompany a border treaty 
it is completely clear he said a treaty would contain 
only the border question 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff also indicated a treaty 
would concern only the border 
silesia and east prussia were awarded to poland and the soviet 
union respectively at the potsdam conference of 1945 that led to 
the expulsion of 12 million germans and at least 2 million died in 
the process 
genscher was born in what now is east germany the foreign 
minister has made clear he and his party are willing in return for 
reunification to give up all claims to the territory lost to 
poland 
seiters said the parliamentary resolution would recommend 
declarations of respect for polands western border by the 
parliaments of both germanys to be made after the east german 
elections march 18 
once germany was united he said the government would make a 
treaty with poland guaranteeing its borders 
gorbachev warned against any attempt by a reunited germany to 
change borders drawn at the end of world war ii 
naturally the inviolability of postwar borders is the main 
issue in this respect he said in moscow to use german 
reunification to reanimate revanchist plans would be to pursue an 
irresponsible policy fraught with very serious consequences 
the bonn newspaper die welt quoted president wojciech jaruzelski 
of poland as saying prolonging the border debate could create an 
atmosphere which overshadows everything and which can complicate 
everything positive for our relations 
it quoted jaruzelelski as saying when asked whether he feared 
german reunification yes and no i worry as a pole and european 
because of historical experiences the position of a mighty power 
a dominance could lead to this position being somehow used at the 
cost of others 
on the other hand jaruzelski said he believes the germans 
themselves the big powers and all european peoples especially the 
poles will do everything so that a united germany will be a 
constructive element in europe 
germanys invasion of poland on sept 1 1939 began world war 
ii 
the newspaper telexed excerpts of the interview to other news 
organizations in advance of publication scheduled for wednesday

americas premier spy plane the sr71 
blackbird came in from the cold war after a quarter century of 
supersonic snooping setting a transcontinental speed record 
tuesday before retiring to a museum home 
in a final fling for the history books one of the black 
daggershaped aircraft flashed from coast to coast in 68 minutes 
17 seconds arriving at washington dulles international airport 
outside the nations capital to the cheers of hundreds of onlookers 
the old record was 3 hours 38 minutes set in 1963 by a boeing 
707 
the blackbird took a running start refueling over the pacific 
ocean at 60000 feet before heading east from the california 
coastline and crossing its finish line near salisbury md said 
malvern gross president of the national aeronatics association 
the blackbird then refueled before cruising in to dulles airport 
the flight also set three other speed records certified by the 
national aeronautic association 
its bittersweet said air force lt col bruce liebman who 
flew blackbirds for the 9th strategic reconnaissance wing at beale 
air force base calif in the 1970s im happy it set the record 
but sad that it has been put to bed 
byebye blackbird said ben rich the lockheed aeronautical 
system co executive who helped design the blackbird i cannot 
honestly say this is a happy day for me 
the blackbird model no 17972 was donated to the smithsonian 
institution which plans to display it at a dulles airport wing of 
the national air and space museum 
against overcast skies the spy plane ended its flight by 
dipping as low as 200 feet above the runway as it whistled past an 
official greeting gate balls of fire trailing its huge engines as 
the pilot suddenly pointed the pencilshaped fuselage toward the 
heavens 
it was one of the few public displays of a blackbird and 
despite the rush to publicize this final run most details of the 
planes design and capabilities are still top secret the air force 
wont even say how many of the planes exist 
maj suzanne randle of the strategic air commands headquarters 
at offutt air force base neb said nine blackbirds are going to 
museums three are being mothballed at palmdale calif and three 
will be used by nasa for research ms randle said she could not 
say whether that accounted for all the planes 
the first flight of a blackbird was in december 1964 it 
regularly flew missions over heavily defended north vietnam and 
provided intelligence in many other regions including the middle 
east and china in 1982 its photographs revealed the presence of 
soviet mig fighters in nicaragua touching off an international 
dispute 
the air force officially retired the blackbird fleet in january 
saying they were too expensive to keep in the air despite their 
technological prowess technological advances also enable 
satellites to do similar work more cheaply 
critics argue however the planes should be kept in service 
because they are more versatile than satellites which are locked 
into specific orbits and can take longer to pass over a trouble 
spot 
the blackbird can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been 
shot down in 25 years of spying it remains the fastest and 
highestflying jet aircraft in the world 
built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees 
fahrenheit its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum 
used on most airplanes powered by two pratt amp whitney turbojet 
engines it can sustain a speed of mach 3 or three times the speed 
of sound its maximum speed is classified 
on tuesdays flight the plane set separate speed records of 
215324 mph between los angeles and washington 224248 mph 
between st louis and cincinnati and 220094 mph between kansas 
city mo and washington sonic booms were reported in various 
communities along the flight path as the plane completed its race 
across the continent 
the pilot was lt col ed yeilding and lt col jt vida was 
the reconnaissance systems officer 
the decision to scrap the blackbirds still worries some members 
of congress and clearly irks airmen who flew the secret aircraft on 
its 65 million miles of spying 
you might ask why retire it said sen john warner 
rva at the dulles arrival ceremony this is a very vivid 
example of what america will go through to scale back defense 
spending later he added this is one of the first victims of 
the rush to reduce the military as a result of lessened eastwest 
tensions 
the blackbirds retirement has special meaning for the pilots 
brig gen harold buck adams who flew the same blackbird on a 
recordsetting speed run from london to los angeles in september 
1971 appeared to be fighting back tears as he stood several yards 
from the plane in addressing the dulles crowd 
she is a truly magnificent machine and shes retiring a 
winner he said

based in honduras told him they are willing to disband but that no 
deadline has been set 
all sides have the good will to achieve demoblization but 
we have not come here to demand anything of anybody were just 
beginning a dialogue said jaime cuadra a representative of mrs 
chamorro 
cuadra talked with reporters at the presidential palace here 
after meeting with president rafael callejas 
mrs chamorro who defeated president daniel ortegas leftist 
sandinista party in nicaraguas national elections feb 25 will 
take office april 25 for a sixyear term 
the date for demobilization of the ussupported contra rebels 
estimated at 10000 in honduran camps along the nicaraguan border 
has emerged as a major stumbling block on the way to a peaceful 
transfer of power in nicaragua 
the sandinistas who lost the elections to chamorross 14party 
united national opposition coalition have demanded the contras 
demobilize before they hand over power to the new administration 
saying that otherwise the ruling party cannot assure a peaceful 
transition 
contra rebel commanders have insisted they will not disarm or 
demobilize until after the transfer of the presidency the 
sandinistarun army and the interior ministry which controls the 
police 
if the sandinistas dont hand over the army and the interior 
ministry they arent handing over anything the people rejected 
the sandinistas on feb 25 and we will not lay down our arms until 
the peoples will is respected said a top contra commander who 
called himself only wilmer 
wilmer who refused to disclose his real name made the 
statement monday in an interview with the associated press at 
yamales the main contra camp 85 miles east of tegucigalpa 
asked about a specific plan for demoblization and a deadline he 
said there is no plan and no established deadline 
the united states which helped form the contras in the early 
1980s and sustained them financially through the decade said last 
week that immediate measures should be taken to achieve the 
contras demobilization 
but the state department also said the rebels must enjoy full 
guarantees regarding personal and economic security at home 
before disbanding 
honduras has been a reluctant host to the contras in recent 
years callejas said last week the rebels should leave as soon as 
possible

the draft guidelines for conducting the us 
census are a cruel joke on american cities new york mayor 
david n dinkins said tuesday in threatening to sue the commerce 
department 
by issuing these draft guidelines the commerce department has 
sent a signal to the census bureau that it wants a political 
census not an honest one dinkins said at a news conference 
but the draft guidelines are a joke a cruel joke on 
americas cities that depend upon a fair census for political 
representation for a fair share of federal funding for our 
constitutional right to equal protection under the law 
if the department has not made some changes when it issues the 
final guidelines march 10 well see them in court dinkins 
said 
the city is seeking an adjustment to the 1980 census which it 
says undercounted the population by 6 percent or 450000 people 
the undercount it said lost the city hundreds of millions of 
dollars in state and federal aid based on a population formula 
and curtailed its political representation in washington and albany 
dinkins major complaint with the draft guidelines was that 
there will be no adjustment unless there is overwhelming 
evidence of an undercount 
even if that evidence is produced an adjustment would occur 
only if it would not be too politically disruptive and the 
explanation for it could be clearly and simply stated in a way 
that is understandable to the general public dinkins said 
plus he said the draft guidelines make the assumption that the 
1990 undercount wont be any worse than the 1980 undercount 
this to me is as bad as the early days of our country when the 
government said we will count africanamericans slaves as 
threefifths of a human being dinkins said

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
tuesday he was unable to judge reports suggesting that american 
hostages in lebanon will be freed soon but added that the existence 
of such speculation is encouraging 
baker asked if the administration had reason for optimism about 
the hostages replied i dont know i mean youre asking me if 
all the smoke out there means there is a fire 
he added we certainly hope that the hostages will be 
released wed like to see anybody that could have influence in 
that regard weigh in 
baker commented at the state department about the latest in a 
string of reports in iranian newspapers as well as optimistic 
assessments by syrian officials suggesting that the long hostage 
ordeal may be ending 
the tehran times a newspaper close to irans president said in 
an editorial that 1990 would be the last year of captivity for the 
hostages 
the report also said resumption of usiranian ties was not a 
precondition for the hostages release 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler commenting on 
speculation about the hostages said i dont know why this many 
rumors are out here i dont have an explanation for that 
baker asked by reporters if he were encouraged by statements 
from iran said we dont have any better way of judging that 
right now frankly than you do we see what is coming across here 
and we are encouraged by the fact there is speculation lets see 
if that speculation proves out 
a senior administration official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said we see a lot of stuff going on 
its kind of like watching a lot of action under a blanket 
the official added were not quite sure whos doing what to 
whom 
the official said were hopeful we dont know enough to be 
optimistic 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater asked about the 
latest tehran times report said its just pretty hard to judge 
it we certainly hope its true 
iran is believed to exert considerable influence over hezbollah 
the umbrella group for radical shiite moslems believed to be 
holding some of the hostages syria is the main power broker in 
lebanon with 40000 troops there 
while saying there is nothing to suggest an imminent release of 
the hostages the administration says there are a lot of talks 
going on behind the scenes by officials outside the us government 
eighteen westerners including eight americans are being held 
capitive in lebanon 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who will mark his fifth 
anniversary in captivity on march 16 
the tehran times in a second editorial said said syrian 
president hafez assad would visit tehran soon after an expected 
trip by his foreign minister farouk alsharaa it also denied 
reports that a trip by the brother of iranian president hashemi 
rafsanjani to the syrian capital of damascus last week was related 
to the hostage question 
in beirut the respected annahar daily ruled out any hostage 
release soon but quoted unidentified lebanese fundamentalist 
sources as saying iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue 
the sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct 
contacts between iran and the united states but both were scouting 
for what was described as a mechanism for releasing the hostages 
the report did not elaborate 
the tehran times for the second time in as many weeks said the 
hostages should go free without preconditions in the past the 
paper has reflected the thinking of president hashemi rafsanjani 
our own assessment indicates that this thorny issue can be 
sorted out in the near future in a sincere spirit by sincere 
people the paper said adding 1990 can and will be the last 
year of the captivity of these hostages 
it said an effort was under way to free the hostages because 
islam in no way allows or condones the idea that people should be 
taken or held hostage

secretary of state james a baker iii urged 
the israeli government on tuesday to approve his terms for talks 
with palestinian arabs or run the risk of a dead end in mideast 
peace efforts 
without a dialogue between israelis and palestinians we can 
never move forward to peace baker said as the two leading 
political parties in israel clashed over his formula for talks 
they are trying to resolve some fairly thorny problems that 
they have within their government baker told reporters i 
think they are working hard and in good faith to resolve those 
problems and we certainly hope they are successful 
baker stopped just short of involving himself in the political 
dispute in israel over his terms for the talks but he left no 
doubt about the outcome he seeks from jerusalem 
what we would like to see is for them to give us a positive 
answer so that we can move forward toward a dialogue between 
israelis and palestinians baker said 
the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler 
meanwhile stressed that baker would continue to press for israelis 
and palestinians to meet in cairo 
he will stay engaged as long as there is hope as long as 
there are genuine efforts on the part of all parties she said 
and he today sees no reason to give up that hope or to 
disengage 
on monday in jerusalem leaders of the likud coalition headed 
by prime minister yitzhak shamir voted to send an israeli team to 
cairo for talks with palestinian delegates but only if east 
jerusalem arabs were excluded from negotiations 
also the likud leaders said they would quit the talks if the 
palestine liberation organization tried to direct the discussions 
this raised the possibility of a breakup of the governments

the house banking committee closed its 
investigation of lincoln savings and loan association and mapped 
plans tuesday to broaden its probe to include spectacular thrift 
failures in texas colorado and florida 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas promised anew to examine the 
failure of silverado banking savings and loan association of 
denver president bushs son neil served on the thrifts board 
regulators have said the younger bush had questionable business 
ties to silverado borrowers 
the committee will hold a march 26 hearing on the failure of 
centrust savings bank of miami a month ago centrust became the 
first sampl to fail because of junk bond losses it was also known 
for spending deposits on a museumquality art collection lavish 
salaries a yacht and limousines 
on may 23 the committee will look at drexel burnham lambert 
inc and what gonzalez called a daisy chain operation in which 
junk bonds were shuffled around the country among institutions 
including lincoln silverado and centrust 
gonzalez plans field hearings april 1112 in dallas to examine 
thrift collapses in texas he said he hoped to subpoena the former 
executives of vernon savings and loan association and sunbelt 
federal savings and loan association 
the panel will also look at the governments 1988 bailout sale 
of american savings and loan association stockton calif to 
texas financier robert bass gonzalez said 
tuesdays hearing the seventh by the committee focusing on 
lincoln scrutinized the web of interlocking land deals involving 
hidden valley and estrella which were to be a massive residential 
developments in the desert 20 miles southwest of phoenix 
chris seefer an examiner in the office of thrift supervisions 
san francisco office complained that political appointees in the 
agencys washington headquarters blocked field examiners from 
scrutinizing the projects after meeting with lincoln owner charles 
keating jr in september 1987 he estimated that caused 200 
million of lincolns 2 billion loss 
gonzalez had invited charles h keating iii son of lincolns 
owner to testify but he did not appear 
the younger keating while still in his 20s drew a 1 million 
annual salary from lincolns parent company american continental 
corp for handling many of his fathers real estate ventures 
the absence says much about the cavalier attitude of the 
keatings gonzalez said he had intended to subpoena the younger 
keating but had not been able to gather the majority of his 
51member committee needed to vote on the action 
for the most part the hearing covered old ground examining a 
land deal between lincoln and ernest c garcia a tucson developer 
and stockbroker lincoln was able to manufacture profits by lending 
garcia 196 million which was never repaid 
garcia used the money to buy the hidden valley land through a 
straw buyer fernando r acosta 
the transaction has been examined in detail in public hearings 
before us district court judge stanley sporkin who is to decide 
on a motion to dismiss keatings lawsuit seeking to reclaim 
lincoln the sampl was seized by the government in april 
garcia who had been subpoenaed by the committee appeared but 
refused to answer questions asserting his constitutional right to 
avoid selfincrimination 
acosta testified briefly saying he acted as a straw buyer in 
the hidden valley sale as a favor to garcia and did not consider 
his actions improper he disclosed he had been questioned by the 
fbi and securities and exchange commission about the transaction 
gonzalez told reporters his committee would release its report 
on the lincoln failure soon possibly in a week

the town meeting had all the makings of a 
lowbudget soap opera a bitter 12year feud between families a 
battle over selling booze and a question about who should govern 
first and foremost voters went to the polls tuesday to decide 
whether the towns only general store mh shermans owned by 
marion and john pelton should be allowed to continue selling beer 
and wine 
a rejection could force residents to travel six miles or more to 
buy beer and wine making rupert one of only six dry towns in 
vermont rupert which borders new york in southern vermont was a 
dry town until voters narrowly approved the sale of beer and wine 
in 1981 
rupert is not the only new england community grappling with 
change 
in vernon neighbors of vermonts only nuclear power plant voted 
monday to support a lowlevel radioactive waste site near the 
plant vermont is the only state with a nuclear power plant that 
has no place to put its lowlevel radiactive nuclear waste 
in addition voters in many vermont towns were asked whether 
they support asking the states congressional delegation to back a 
5 percent cut in defense spending and redirect it to domestic needs 
in the coastal maine town of penobscot residents considered a 
plan tuesday to abolish local property taxes and finance town 
services instead through voluntary payments and user fees the 
towns budget is 12 million a year 
in rupert with a population just over 600 many feel the real 
issue on the ballot has more to do with the local family feud than 
the issue of wet versus dry 
its really just a grudge match said rupert selectman jay 
wilson jr adding that the feud began about 12 years ago when 
john pelton charged that wilsons son now town road commissioner 
and several of his friends were taking gasoline from the town 
garage for personal use 
wilson who has served on the board of selectmen for 32 years 
and some of his family have reportedly not been in peltons store 
since then 
wilson also is struggling to keep his seat on the board of 
select he is being challenged by dan nardi who supports keeping 
the alcohol laws intact 
the battle over alcohol sales in town has been contentious with 
wilson accusing pelton of selling alcohol to minors which pelton 
denies and a recent selectmens meeting erupting into a fist 
fight over the issue 
its wilson again pelton said one resident who asked not 
to be identified added another weve got a lot of family 
problems around here 
pelton is not the only one feuding with the wilson clan edward 
lewis says his road is the last to get plowed by the road 
commissioner wilsons son after every snowstorm because he has 
challenged the elder wilson for the selectmans seat several times 
rev paul mychack of the church of christ says some residents 
have been against me mindlessly because he took another of 
wilsons sons to court 11 years ago 
its unbelievable how divided the town is said mychack 
im so upset about the violence before this is over im afraid 
someone will get hurt 
mh shermans located two doors down from the post office is 
an unlikely battle field the small store is crammed with 
everything from blue seal livestock feed to disposable diapers and 
displays a bulletin board touting an upcoming chicken and biscuit 
dinner to benefit the fire department 
this is a nice store its almost like a community center 
here said andrea lenhardt a clerk at shermans when the 
power goes out in town the first place people come to is this 
place 
lenhardt echoes her bosses denials that they sell beer and wine 
to minors we are very careful especially if it is someone we 
dont know sometimes we tell people dont even take it beer or 
wine out of the cabinet unless they have id 
but some residents including wilsons daughterinlaw lisa 
complain that too often residents gather at the store not to mingle 
with neighbors but to get drunk 
you get more obnoxious people said lisa wilson they sit 
at the store and get drunk and hassle people 
traditionally the first tuesday in march ruperts town meeting 
allows residents to decide issues crucial often whether to buy a 
new snow plow or raise selectmens salaries with a show of hands 
state offices and schools are closed for the day

parliament on tuesday adopted a labor law 
that recognizes the right to strike for the first time in east 
germanys 40year history while forbidding employers from locking 
out workers 
the embrace of one capitalist tactic and rejection of another 
highlights the indecision gripping east germans as they begin 
considering how to merge their nation with west germany 
members of parliament praised the new labor code that mixes 
marketstyle reforms with traditional socialist protections but 
conceded it probably will stir protest among west german investors 
and employers eyeing unification 
the labor law easily won approval from the 385 lawmakers present 
for what is expected to be the last session of the 500member 
peoples chamber prior to the nations first competitive elections 
on march 18 only six voted against the measure with 53 
abstentions debate was minimal 
the future of the new labor law may rest with the new 
400member parliament many labor principles embodied in the law 
require implementing legislation that will have to be tackled after 
the new legislative body is seated 
the strike clause however is among changes to take effect next 
week 
lawmakers hailed the nolockout clause as a workers right not 
enjoyed in west germany 
because the law is likely to be seen as imbalanced by west 
german industries seeking to build plants or engage in joint 
production operations in east germany it may serve to slow the 
investment considered essential to turning around the flagging 
economy 
the law comes in the form of a constitutional change it permits 
unions to call strikes if arbitration fails to resolve 
labormanagement differences in negotiations 
strikes have been forbidden in east germany and most socialist 
states labor unions traditionally were powerless to challenge 
policies handed down by communist authorities who dominated all 
social and economic matters until last fall 
the government now will have the right to intercede and stop a 
strike only if the walkout is deemed a threat to public wellbeing 
the law provides that no one can reduce or hinder unions in 
their rightful occupation 
communist lawmaker kaethe niederkirchner said such a broad 
protection was likely to disturb the capitalists next door he 
quoted west german employers association president klaus murmann as 
describing the law as a hindrance to intergerman economic 
cooperation 
parliament also adopted additional measures on election 
procedures including extending voting rights to foreigners who 
have lived in east germany for two years or more

a gourmet brownie maker is claiming in a federal 
lawsuit it was burned by a 71yearold baking giant in minnesota 
that allegedly stole a recipe and sold it under a new name 
the boston brownie co alleges mcglynn bakeries of eden prairie 
minn took the batter recipes for boston brownies and marketed 
them with a few minor changes under the name classic brownie 
batter mcglynn denies the allegations 
the us district court lawsuit filed last last month cites an 
agreement between the two companies in which mcglynn would 
manufacture the batter for boston brownie and for its own store in 
minneapolis the agreement said the recipes were a trade secret and 
that mcglynn would protect them the lawsuit contends 
boston brownies which has one store in the faneuil hall 
marketplace makes gourmet brownies in 20 flavors in addition 
to the traditional fudge and fudge nut varieties offerings include 
rocky road mint toffee amaretto kahlua white chocolate 
macadamia nut and chocolate chip 
its my recipe my process my logo and all of that said 
laura j katleman the owner and inventor of boston brownie which 
has sales of about 400000 annually 
the classic brownie batters which mcglynn has marketed for 
about two years also come in flavors such as rocky road toffee 
mint and amaretto as well as chocolate chocolate pecan cherry 
white chocolate chunk and blond chocolate chip 
have you ever heard of amaretto brownies where did he get 
those flavors katleman asked monday whats more she said 
the fudginess the ingredients they read the same as mine my 
chemist says for mcglynn to have come up with these formulas it 
would have been a miracle 
katleman said she was appalled by what she called mcglynns lack 
of honor in allegedly fudging things so her brownies were sold 
under his name mcglynn bakeries is run by michael j mcglynn 
what made her particularly angry she said was the way he 
wooed me he invited me to his home i met his family he was so 
warm and sweet and to find out he was doing this 
maybe i am naive about the workings of big business but his 
conduct in this whole matter was just appalling to me 
sales at mcglynn which has retail bakeries and manufactures 
frozen dough and prebaked foods totaled about 100 million in 
1989 mcglynn said in a telephone interview he said the sales from 
classic batter brownies comprised less than onequarter of one 
percent of total business 
mcglynn declined to comment on any aspect of the suit but a 
lawyer for mcglynn bakeries jim harlow said the company denied 
all of the suits allegations 
we think the allegations of the complaint are groundless and 
the company intends to vigorously defend against them said 
harlow who declined further comment 
katleman said mcglynn first approached her after he had sampled 
some of her brownies on a pass through faneuil hall 
he was just enamored of the whole concept of gourmet 
brownies said katleman 
mcglynn wanted to lease the boston brownies recipe for franchise 
stores but they could not agree on terms katleman said instead 
they agreed to have him manufacture her batter of which she needs 
a couple of thousand pounds a week she said 
last december katleman discovered the classic brownie batters 
in a mcglynn catalogue which she saw in the offices of another 
batter maker 
the guy started to read down the list chocolate amaretto 
rocky road and he asked me are you sure he hasnt ripped you 
off i was just blown away katleman said 
the lawsuit seeks to restrain mcglynn from any use of boston 
brownies batter recipes products formulas and processes it also 
seeks damages but katleman said she could not name a specific 
amount

house democratic leader richard gephardt said 
tuesday the united states should offer direct aid to the soviet 
union to ensure that its reforms succeed 
we should be investing in our own selfinterest gephardt 
said and stability democracy and a market economy in the soviet 
union are in americas strong selfinterest 
the proposal brought immediate criticism from some quarters and 
a presidential spokesman said the soviets dont want direct aid 
sen bill bradley dnj also said that the soviets havent 
requested us help and that if they did it would be wasted 
without economic reform unless they reform the economy its 
going down a rathole bradley said 
others on capitol hill said that while they thought gephardts 
proposal would spark a useful debate the idea would fall on 
disapproving public ears 
if youre going to start giving foreign aid to the hated 
commies of 70 years worth youve got a real sales job to do in 
the united states said sen alan simpson rwyo 
gorbachev needs us a lot more than we need him said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan we ought to extract a fair 
price for any support including a requirement that the soviets 
stop aiding client states from cuba to afghanistan 
if gorbachev needs some ready cash he can ask for a refund 
from castro and the others dole said in a speech released by his 
office 
gephardt noted an appeal by czechoslovak president vaclav havel 
in a feb 21 speech to congress to help his country by helping the 
soviet union continue on its reformist road 
if havel who was imprisoned by the communists can call for aid 
to the soviets the least we can do is listen gephardt said in 
a speech that also contained his harshest criticism to date of 
bushs policy toward eastern europe 
he accused bush of a lack of leadership in this most crucial 
moment throwing billions of dollars into the military budget to 
defend against communists who dont want to be communists any 
more while ignoring their economic needs 
its as though george bushs pentagon budget were written by 
someone who hadnt read a newspaper in a year gephardt said 
drawing applause indeed most of the administrations budget was 
drafted last year after the opening of the berlin wall but before 
many other dramatic developments in eastern europe 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the 
charges general old political stuff and added the soviet 
union doesnt want direct aid 
but others while saying the soviet union should have to meet 
certain conditions before receiving us help acknowledged that 
events have moved so rapidly that aid is no longer out of the 
question 
house speaker thomas s foley said he agreed with gephardt 
its a dramatically different circumstance from a few months 
ago foley said noting local elections that have taken place in 
the soviet union and the existence of competing political parties 
those changes are coming on very fast and we have a stake in 
this country in supporting those changes foley said 
gephardt a 1988 candidate for the democratic presidential 
nomination proposed the idea of direct aid in a speech to the 
liberal center for national policy and acknowledged that it would 
be difficult politically 
there are votes to be lost in taking a risk for peace in 
appearing insufficiently tough on the soviets and there are votes 
to be lost in calling on the american people to make some changes 
to adapt to the changing world the missouri congressman said 
speaking to reporters later gephardt added 
we live in a paradox we now face the prospect of giving 
assistance and support to people whove oppressed people for 45 
years 
but he said that during a trip to eastern europe two months ago 
i was embarrassed that we are not being as strong and as 
courageous as they are cant we do something to help 
specifically gephardt called for a food for freedom program 
to send us food aid to the soviets the lifting of trade 
restrictions including those on hightechnology exports and 
guarantees for businesses that want to invest in the soviet union 
a stronger soviet economy will facilitate the process of 
peace said gephardt how can the soviets pull red army troops 
out of eastern europe if they have no jobs and no homes for them to 
return to in russia 
direct us aid is possible now because the cold war as we 
have known it for four decades is over gephardt said while the 
possibility remains that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
could be ousted or his reforms could fail superpower competition 
in arms and influence has changed in fundamental ways he said 
the united states since may 1985 has sold 20 million metric tons 
of usgrown wheat to the soviet union under subsidies worth 
hundreds of millions of dollars but has never provided direct aid 
of the kind gephardt proposed 
some of gephardts colleagues also questioned the propriety of 
the suggestion and his motives 
hes got the burning bosom syndrome to be president of the 
united states simpson said 
of course theres a major question of how we react to the 
startling developments in the soviet union said rep henry hyde 
rill but mr gorbachev has got to stop subsidizing their 
imperial designs regionally around the world let him tell mr 
castro hes on his own in cuba 
then they might be entitled to look to us for concrete 
assistance hyde said he added i know mr gephardt is anxious 
to make a mark for himself but we should speak with one voice on 
these very delicate questions

a romanian exile leader told prime minister 
margaret thatcher and members of parliament tuesday that chances of 
free elections in romania are nil because communists control the 
government media and economy 
ion ratiu said the national salvation front has taken over the 
old communist party structure and is using it to help win the may 
20 general election the front took power in the december 
revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
ratiu 72 who arrived from bucharest tuesday and planned to 
return wednesday is president of the world union of free 
romanians he was granted asylum in britain in 1940 and became a 
wealthy businessman he now hopes to run for parliament in romania 
as a candidate of the national peasants party the largest 
opposition group 
after meeting mrs thatcher he told an allparty meeting at the 
house of commons that the western news media and western embassies 
in romania were perpetuating the view that the opposition parties 
are incapable of producing a coherent government 
ratiu said many of the 47 political parties formed since the 
revolution are phantom parties subservient to the front 
he said that nonetheless if free and unfettered elections were 
held and the result was a plurality for the opposition a coalition 
of nonfront parties would form a government that is very 
credible and very capable 
ratiu said he doubted there will be free elections 
in the country at large the entire structure of the 
communist party with small exceptions is now active as the front 
the chances of free fair and unfettered elections are nil under 
these circumstances he said 
effectively the front still has control of the media economy 
and the government infrastructure and all its members have a vested 
selfinterest in victory for the front party 
ratiu chided french president francois mitterrand and premier 
michel rocard for receiving prime minister petre roman and not 
arranging a single ministerial meeting for corneliu coposu 
president of the peasants party who has been in paris this week 
i do not wish to see the front recognized as a legitimate 
government he said 
ratiu said romanias interim president ion iliescu agreed last 
week to allow the world union of free romanians to publish an 
independent newspaper and new radio and television stations 
a printing press will be delivered next week and ratiu said he 
expects to start publication in two weeks equipment for the tv 
channel is in bucharest and we can start it at once within two 
days he said 
he said the exile group would send 100 tons of paper to romania 
for the election campaign and it would be offered equally to all 
parties including the front

all nations in the former soviet bloc 
except romania will have trade agreements with the european 
community by the end of april a senior official of the community 
said tuesday 
frans andriessen commissioner for trade and foreign affairs 
said accords with east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia would 
be concluded before the ec summit on eastern europe is held april 
28 in dublin ireland 
agreements were signed in 1988 and 1989 with hungary poland and 
the soviet union the scope of an agreement czechoslovakia signed 
in 1988 is being widened 
andriessen said the first generation agreements would be a 
basis for more extensive commercial relations he said a pact could 
not be signed with romania because its government was more of a 
caretaker administration than the others 
second generation agreements to be negotiated later are 
intended to be a model we can use for the construction of a 
greater europe andriessen said 
the official said those agreements would deal with establishing 
a free trade zone political cooperation common projects in 
sectors such as transport and the environment and financial deals 
like a 12 billion loan arranged for hungary

the air force is paying for a 100000 
study to determine how lowflying f4 phantom fighter jets may 
affect the health and behavior of pregnant horses kept near 
military bases 
simulated bursts of jet noise will reverberate through barns for 
nine months to determine their effect on eight pregnant 
thoroughbred and saddlebred horses researchers at the university 
of florida said monday 
another control group of eight pregnant mares will not be 
exposed to the flyover din 
heavily pregnant mares may be more susceptible to the stress 
of aircraft noise said dr michelle leblanc a veterinarian 
one of the common complaints the air force receives is that 
abortions seem to occur more often in mares subjected to lowflying 
aircraft 
leblanc associate professor at the university of floridas 
department of large animal clinical sciences said about 50 studies 
on the effects of aircraft noise on animals have been conducted 
since the arrival of sonic boom in the 1950s 
but because many studies werent considered scientifically 
valid the air force sought additional research with domestic 
animals she said 
the study is funded by the air forces unit of noise and sonic 
boom impact technology she said 
the reason for the research on domestic animals is to provide 
data on general and potential damage claims incurred by the air 
force as a result of farm or ranch overflights said maj michael 
thompson project manager of air force studies on sonic booms 
leblanc said stress may affect the quantity and quality of 
antibodies produced in the mares first milk or the ability of 
foals to absorb the antibodies 
foals rely on these antibodies for protection against 
infectious diseases during the first few weeks of life and theyre 
only capable of absorbing these antibodies during their first 18 
hours of life she said 
each randomly timed noise burst will last three seconds 
increasing about 50 decibels per second until it peaks at 120 
decibels comparable to the noise of a jackhammer she said 
ultrasound will be used in monitoring the horses heart activity 
and fetal movement while video cameras record behavioral reactions 
to the sounds 
leblanc aims to pinpoint the threshold of noise that prompts a 
frightened horse to bolt the air force could use that information 
to determine when their aircraft should fly higher to diffuse the 
noise she said 
the horses in the study might get a little upset over the jet 
sounds at first but they should adjust to it quickly leblanc 
said 
next year with the help of real air force jets leblanc will 
continue the study using authentic flyover experiments she said

a pair of pet pigs found themselves in 
the pokey for promenading down a street and stopping the traffic 
police took four hours to round up the pigs and a goat that 
joined them and took them to the pound monday after officials at 
homestead elementary school complained they were blocking traffic 
officer terry simpson said she decided to rein in the trio 
because owner marge lampert had been ticketed a dozen times for 
failing to control her animals and allegedly had not paid up 
lampert an equipment operator at elmendorf air force base said 
she bought the pigs at a state fair last year and her children 
named the cute and cuddly things joseph and miss piggy now that 
theyre grown theyve become too hard to hold she said 
i had hoped to confine them well and let the kids in the 
neighborhood experience farm animals without offending anyone 
she said i seem to have offended everyone 
im not a real organized person so sometimes i get more than 
i can handle she said 
she also owns four dogs a cat and 15 tropical birds

yelena bonner widow of andrei sakharov said 
tuesday the soviet action against ethnic unrest in the caucasus 
cost more lives than the chinese army crackdown on prodemocracy 
protesters in june 
she is visiting rome as a guest of the socialist party and 
commented during a news conference at party headquarters 
mikhail s gorbachev will go down in history not as the father 
of perestroika but as the instigator of genocide bonner said 
trouble began between the neighboring caucasus republics of 
armenia and azerbaijan two years ago over nagornokarabakh an 
enclave in azerbaijan whose population is predominantly armenian 
soviet troops stormed baku the capital of azerbaijan on jan 
13 to stop ethnic fighting and soviet officials say more than 170 
people died in the crackdown bonner did not say how many people 
she believed were killed 
hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators were killed in 
june when the chinese army crushed prodemocracy demonstrators in 
beijings tiananmen square 
bonner also criticized gorbachevs political reforms suggesting 
the mass of soviet people had lost faith in their president i 
say this with sadness and regret she said 
sakharov a physicist largely responsible for the soviet 
hydrogen bomb won the nobel peace prize in 1975 because of his 
long campaign for human rights he died in december

human testing of a potential aids 
vaccine was approved monday by state health officials but 
researchers cautioned that development of a true vaccine will take 
years 
the approval was the first for human trials of hgp30 in the 
united states according to the companies that developed the drug 
clinical trials will be held at san francisco general hospital 
and the university of southern california medical center in los 
angeles said dr james kahn who will conduct the san francisco 
tests the trials will begin in two to three months he said 
this is just a very preliminary stage said kahn who called 
hgp30 a candidate vaccine its the first step but its not 
something thats going to cure aids and it is not intended as a 
cure or treatment for aids 
the trials were approved by the state department of health 
services food and drug branch said tom hazlet of the branch 
in the tests 24 healthy people who test negative for human 
immunodeficiency virus or hiv which causes aids will receive 
escalating doses of hgp30 and be monitored for at least a year 
doctors will try to determine the vaccines toxicity and see if 
it causes the body to produce antibodies to the virus kahn said 
another potential vaccine for the incurable disease is being 
tested at the national cancer institute in washington dc kahn 
said 
experts in the field say tests of a potential vaccine for an 
aidslike disease in monkeys also shows promise for the development 
of a treatment that could prevent aids in humans 
hgp30 targets for destruction a core protein of hiv the 
vaccine is designed to trigger antibodies to the protein which is 
found in all strains of the aids virus according to alpha 1 
biomedical inc of washington and celsci corp of alexandria va 
which developed the vaccine 
hgp30 is the first potential vaccine to be tested in humans 
where the active component is a completely synthetic molecule the 
companies said in a news release 
because the vaccine lacks live or dead virus there is no chance 
that hgp30 could cause aids infection the companies said 
kahn assistant professor of medicine at the university of 
californiasan francisco and a member of the aidsoncology division 
at the universityaffiliated san francisco general said most 
researchers believe it will be five to 10 years before an effective 
aids vaccine is developed 
by the end of last month the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 121645 cases 
of aids in the united states with 72580 deaths or 60 percent of 
all cases

outgoing president daniel ortega 
criticized the united states and honduras on tuesday for failing to 
help demobilize the contra rebels 
why has the government of the united states delayed ordering 
the transfer of humanitarian funds to the united nations or the 
organization of american states to speed up demobilization and 
repatriation of the contras ortega said in a speech 
why is honduras delaying a decision to expel the contras from 
its territory he said 
there are an estimated 4000 contras inside nicaragua and 
thousands more in camps in southern honduras just across the 
border from nicaragua 
ortega whose leftist sandinista government has been fighting 
the ussupported contra rebels during eight of its 10 years in 
power spoke before us and latin american publishers at a meeting 
of the inter american press association 
also on tuesday violeta barrios de chamorro who defeated 
ortega in elections feb 25 traveled to the costa rican city of 
liberia for talks with president oscar arias 
it was her first trip abroad since she was elected and she 
praised arias for a plan he devised in 1987 that earned him the 
nobel peace prize and eventually led to the nicaraguan elections 
mrs chamorro asked arias to endorse her proposal that central 
america declared a demilitarized zone 
i want your valued support as winner of the nobel peace 
prize for my proposal that the presidents of central america sign 
an agreement declaring central america demilitarized to be signed 
by the six countries of the isthmus and endorsed by all latin 
american countries she said 
the sandinistas have recently taken a harder line against the 
contras saying they will not permit the dismantling of the 
sandinista army unless the contras are demobilized before chamorro 
takes office april 25 for a sixyear term 
but contra leaders have balked at the idea of breaking up their 
forces immediately saying they will hand over their weapons to 
mrs chamorros government only after it takes office to ensure 
they wont be harassed by the sandinista military 
the government declared a ceasefire following the elections but 
contra groups have been moving among the population in several 
towns in the interior and there were firefights this week with the 
sandinista army near the northern city of matagalpa 
the strengthening of the democratic process in nicaragua will 
depend on the maturity of the us government of those who govern 
and those who are governed here and on the attitude of the 
government of honduras ortega said 
ortega urged the united states to assume a responsible 
attitude and accused the contras of being bent on revenge 
they think the time has come to collect dues to chop heads 
he said 
as one of his last acts in office ortega said he was sending a 
bill to the national assembly abolishing a decadeold news 
censorship law that will also permit the establishment of private 
television stations both by the sandinistas and sympathizers of 
the 14party coalition headed by mrs chamorro the united national 
opposition 
on monday ortega had warned of renewed fighting if chamorros 
government enrolls former guardsmen or contra rebels in nicaraguas 
armed forces controlled by sandinista militants 
a national war will break out said ortega at a rally of 
hundreds of students in managua inaugurating the scholastic year 
both ortega and mrs chamorros have been calling on the contras 
to disband immediately the united states has also urged such 
demobilization saying the little nonlethal aid it now provides 
them is about to end 
in tegucigalpa honduras foreign minister mario carias zapata 
on tuesday said repatriation talks were continuing

a federal judge accused of using his office 
to do favors for convicted felons testified tuesday that he lied 
when he told a lawyer he had disclosed a wiretap to its target 
in his second day on the stand us district court judge robert 
aguilar also accused a series of prosecution witnesses of lying or 
being mistaken in saying they had held conversations or meetings 
with him 
the witnesses included a former lover a former secretary a 
friend who was secretly cooperating with the fbi and a deputy us 
marshal 
the judge denied every accusation against him that he had tried 
to influence criminal cases by approaching fellow judges that he 
helped his former secretary remain a fugitive that he twice 
disclosed a wiretap to its target that he lied to the fbi and 
that he told a witness to lie to a grand jury 
aguilar 58 of san jose is charged with eight felonies 
including a charge that he used his office as a racketeering 
enterprise to obstruct justice the first such accusation against 
a federal judge 
a judge since 1980 he faces a prison sentence of up to 55 years 
if convicted he also could be removed from office by congress 
regardless of the verdict 
in asserting that he had lied in the past aguilar was seeking 
to defuse potentially damaging prosecution evidence a secretly 
made tape recording of a luncheon meeting in which he said he had 
relayed word to abe chapman an elderly relative by marriage that 
he was being wiretapped 
aguilar is charged with twice revealing the tap to chapman in 
august 1987 and february 1988 on monday he denied knowing that 
chapman was being wiretapped 
but in may 1988 attorney ed solomon a friend and former 
classmate of aguilars agreed with the fbi to wear a tape recorder 
to two meetings with the judge on one of the tapes aguilar said 
he had relayed word to chapman about a wiretap so that he would 
call on pay phones in the future 
that was not a true statement aguilar testified tuesday 
i was bragging to ed solomon trying to make him feel 
better the judge said recalling that solomon had appeared 
distraught about an fbi investigation what ive said here under 
oath was absolutely the truth 
aguilar also testified about his involvement in the case of rudy 
tham a former teamsters leader who was represented by solomon in 
seeking a new trial on a 1980 embezzlement conviction 
aguilar testified that he and solomon had never discussed thams 
case 
aguilar is accused of trying to influence us district judge 
stanley weigel to rule favorably in the case the prosecution 
contends he told solomon to lie to the grand jury about their 
discussions on the case and that he lied when he denied to the fbi 
that he had discussed the case with solomon 
i have never discussed the tham case with ed solomon never 
discussed the merits of the case aguilar said he said their 
conversations involved only procedural aspects of the case such as 
how to file a motion for a hearing

the pool of prospective jurors for john 
poindexters irancontra trial grew to 35 tuesday including a 
woman who campaigned for jesse jackson and another familiar enough 
with the case to know former president reagan had refused to turn 
over his personal diary 
eleven people were disqualified including a retired cia 
research analyst who conceded the agency had made mistakes but 
not very many 
on the second day of the jury selection process us district 
court judge harold greene said i think we can do with 45 
people before proceeding with choosing a panel of 12 jurors and 
six alternates he said he expects to fill the pool by midday 
wednesday and have opening statements on thursday morning 
of the 35 accepted so far 27 are women and eight men 
under questioning by the judge the secretary who has campaigned 
for jackson said she could be impartial adding that she had once 
sent a getwell card to nancy reagan when she was sick 
an employee at the university of the district of columbia she 
had seen poindexter aide oliver north on television testifying 
about shredding documents 
i knew he north had a secretary and she sneaked out with 
documents on her person said the woman but she added that she 
wasnt familiar with mr poindexter 
a bridal consultant who became part of the jury pool said she 
recalled that poindexter was norths boss but little else 
she said she heard that reagan had refused to turn over to 
poindexter his diary or private letter book and a video was 
offered instead 
reagans videotaped testimony taken feb 1617 will be shown at 
poindexters trial said richard beckler lawyer for reagans 
former national security adviser reagan and the bush 
administration invoked executive privilege in refusing to turn over 
36 of reagans diary excerpts to poindexter greene is expected to 
rule on the question at some point 
also sent into the jury pool was a retired defense department 
employee who got the watergate scandal mixed up with the 
irancontra affair 
the prospective juror a woman who worked at the army materiel 
command in alexandria va said oliver norths trial last year was 
abot the tapes he had so many tapes he did erase oliver north 
and secretary 
during watergate thenpresident nixons secretary rose mary 
woods said she might have accidentally erased a portion of one 
taped conversation the tape in question was of a conversation 
between nixon with his chief of staff hr haldeman about how to 
handle the spreading fbi investigation of the watergate scandal 
disqualified from the pool was a retired cia research analyst 
who spent 25 years at the agency and said she didnt want to 
discuss her work she said she has no firm opinions about 
whether right and wrong was done in the irancontra affair 
asked whether she could be impartial if there was evidence at 
the trial that the cia had done something wrong the woman said 
the cia has made mistakes over the years but not very many 
another potential juror was disqualified after saying she 
thought poindexter had been involved in doing something that he 
shouldnt have done 
i didnt think it was right in fact i knew it wasnt said 
the woman a retiree who had worked for the us air force 
poindexters low public profile compared with keen public 
awareness of north is making it a relatively simple task to select 
a jury for poindexters trial it took more than a week to select a 
jury last year for norths trial because so many prospective jurors 
were familiar with testimony he had given congress in 1987 under a 
grant of immunity from prosecution 
poindexter is under indictment on charges of conspiracy two 
counts of obstructing congress and two counts of making false 
statements the charges relate to allegations that poindexters 
covered up norths secret resupply network to the contra rebels in 
nicaragua and to allegations that poindexters lied concerning a 
november 1985 shipment of hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran

in votes without precedent in un history two 
reformminded east european countries sided with western 
delegations on resolutions dealing with the human rights situation 
in cuba and china 
a usinitiated measure critical of practices under president 
fidel castro was passed 1912 in the un human rights commission 
with hungary and bulgaria among those voting in favor while the 
soviet union cast a dissenting ballot 
poland and czechoslovakia attending as nonvoting observers 
added to the havana governments isolation by cosponsoring the 
text introduced by us chief delegate armando valladares a former 
cuban political prisoner 
hungary and bulgaria also joined the west in opposing a proposal 
by pakistan that no action be taken on a mildly worded resolution 
on china the resolution included a guarded reference to last 
junes bloody crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing 
however the pakistani motion narrowly carried the result of 
intensive chinese lobbying among third world members of the 
43nation organization 
the us resolution on cuba had been gradually softened 
following consultation with other western delegations valladares 
hailed its approval as a victory for the fight for human rights 
around the world 
it expresses concern at reports that witnesses who testified 
before commission members visiting cuba on an unprecedented 
factfinding mission in 1988 were subsequently subject to arrest 
harassment and other reprisals 
cuba is called upon to honor its guarantees not to take any 
action against these witnesses and to provide the commission with 
a response to unanswered questions put to the cuban authorities 
by mission members 
the resolution asks un secretary general javier perez de 
cuellar to provide the commission with results of contacts he 
promised to maintain with cuba on the issue 
the 1988 mission which had been invited by cuba compiled a 
largely noncommittal report listing allegations of gross violations 
together with denials by havana and claims of a clean record 
cuban deputy foreign minister raul roa kouri addressing the 
commission before the rollcall vote said the resolution was 
totally unacceptable 
he branded it yet another us attempt to obtain through 
pressure what it could not obtain through aggression by 
mercenaries terrorist infiltration murder attempts on our leaders 
and economic blockade 
valladares told reporters that cuba now would have to give 
comprehensive answers to questions on basic freedoms as well as to 
allegations of torture and other abuses involving hundreds of 
people 
he said the us move obtained a majority because no one wants 
to be associated with cuba after what happened to nicolae 
ceausescu the romanian communist dictator who was overthrown and 
executed last december 
romania could happen all over again in cuba but even worse 
he said i am very optimistic i think the days of latin 
americas last dictatorship are numbered 
czechoslovakias zdenek pagac told the meeting before the vote 
that some may call his countrys support for the resolution a 
historic moment but our position is not surprising 
he said defense of human rights was free of ideological 
aspects under the new prague government which is led by 
noncommunists the soviet delegate limited his comment to voicing 
regret at politicizing the issue 
at tuesdays session us ambassador morris b abram denounced 
a 15yearold general assembly resolution equating zionism to 
racism as a disgrace and urged it be scrapped 
he told the commission zionism has been a model for all 
honorable national liberation movements and said zionism and 
racism are total contradictions 
abram who has held high posts in american jewish organizations 
said the sponsors of the 1975 resolution tried to classify 
jewry and the jewish state as infected with criminality and thus 
to replay hitlers themes that led to the holocaust 
the united nations was founded in the wake of the defeat of 
hitlers crimes it would be an awful twist of history if the 
united nations became the executor of hitlers prophecy abram 
said

organization had sent 433 observers to 4391 polling places as part 
of a highly sophisticated system of onthespot checks and computer 
tabulation that included an electric power plant to be use in case 
of a black out in public services 
the oas team the largest to verify the election received the 
full cooperation of all the nicaraguan competing parties and all 
nations of the hemisphere which provided us with realiable 
specialists in each aspect on an electoral process he said 
the oas team is being scaled down to about 50 until the transfer 
of power he added 
baena soares said the information he gave to the oas council 
will be follow up by a more detailed written report 
the oas in a joint operation with the united nations also is 
pushing for the dismantling of the usbacked contras which have 
been resisting mobilization

elections and the dismantling of the contras

police arrested 21 antitax demonstrators outside 
a community council meeting in bristol on tuesday and protests 
brought council business to a halt in norwich and maidenhead 
councils deliberating their assessments under the new community 
tax also were disrupted in bradford birmingham exeter and 
worcester according to press association britains domestic news 
agency 
four constables were injured during five hours of protests in 
bristol police said scuffles broke out as the crowd learned that 
the council had set one of the highest taxes in england 
prime minister margaret thatchers government introduced the new 
tax which is assessed against every adult to replace the property 
tax the tax is intended to make it clear to voters whether their 
local council members are frugal spenders 
the average english household will pay 280 more under the new 
tax than under the property tax an increase from 837 to 1112 
british broadcasting corp radio reported tuesday 
however the charges vary widely from community to community 
the lesson will be learned that it is the labor opposition 
party authorities which are the high spenders and it is the 
conservative ones which look after their constituents mrs 
thatcher told the house of commons on tuesday 
however mrs thatchers popularity has suffered because of the 
new tax and many people have joined the revolt 
the council in norwich abandoned its meeting when about 200 
people in the public gallery shouted abuse tossed rubbish and tore 
up council agendas the council chamber looked like it had been 
covered in snow said council member chris wright 
an estimated 2000 demonstrators outside chanted no poll tax 
and thatcher out 
it is called a poll tax after a tax levied on individuals in the 
middle ages 
the maidenhead council also halted its meeting when a crowd of

vice premier shimon peres on tuesday threatened 
to bring down the government unless israels cabinet gives 
immediate approval to us proposals for starting a dialogue with 
palestinians 
the decisionmaking inner cabinet is scheduled to meet 
wednesday with peres centerleft labor party and prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud bloc still at odds over the us 
plan 
peres read an ultimatum after a 45minute meeting of labor 
cabinet ministers at his office in tel aviv he demanded a cabinet 
meeting to decide whether to accept the plan which the parties 
have been squabbling over since october 
labor ministers demand a discussion and decision on a 
positive answer to the questions us secretary of state james a 
baker iii presented to israel it said 
peres told reporters he would consider a tie vote in the inner 
cabinet which has six members of each party as a negative 
response that would bring an end to the government 
we demand a vote and a decision tomorrow he said 
baker urged israel to approve his terms for talks or run the 
risk of coming to a dead end in mideast peace efforts 
he told reporters in washington on tuesday without a dialogue 
between israelis and palestinians we can never move forward to 
peace 
baker said he believed israel was working hard and in good 
faith to resolve those problems and we certainly hope they are 
successful 
in an interview on israel television foreign minister moshe 
arens of likud declined to say if the issue would come to a vote 
wednesday or even be discussed 
but he said in an israel radio interview i dont see any 
reason for dismantling the government i think i hope and i expect 
that we can unite around the positions presented by likud 
ministers 
baker has presented proposals aimed at meeting palestinian 
demands that exiled palestinians and arabs from east jerusalem be 
eligible for the negotiating team sent to cairo 
the key issue is likuds refusal to accept any palestinian who 
lives in israeliannexed east jerusalem home to 140000 
palestinians shamir claims such respresentation would threaten 
israels claim to sovereignty over the unified city 
the plo has demanded that east jerusalem be the capital of an 
independent palestinian state 
on monday likud demanded that labor approve its call for the 
exclusion of all east jerusalem residents it also insisted on 
labors support in abandoning the talks if the plo was found to be 
involved in negotiations in any way 
labors statement tuesday reaffirmed the partys commitment to 
the status of jerusalem as the sovereign and united capital of 
israel and stressed that in accordance with the governments 
guidelines israel will not conduct negotiations with the plo 
but the ministers said they completely reject any attempt by 
likud to deviate from the original may 14 1989 peace plan 
which made no mention of barring east jerusalem residents 
in calling for a showdown peres was backed by labors no 2 
man defense minister yitzhak rabin whose hawkish views are often 
closer to shamirs positions 
labor said it would convene a meeting of its cabinet ministers 
immediately after the inner cabinet session wednesday a decision 
to leave the government would have to be approved by the partys 
bureau and then by the meeting of its central committee set for 
march 15 
if the cabinet approves the baker proposals the united states 
would be expected to invite the foreign ministers of israel and 
egypt for a meeting to prepare for the cairo talks 
among the outstanding tasks would be naming a palestinian 
delegation a contentious issue since palestinians insist that the 
plo pick the negotiators 
the cairo meeting would discuss israels plan for elections in 
the occupied territories the scene of the arab uprising in which 
659 palestinians and 43 israelis have been killed since december 
1987 palestinians would be elected to negotiate a limited autonomy 
scheme for their 17 million brethren in the occupied lands 
both ideas are a compromise with palestinian demands for a clear 
plo role in peace talks and an independent state in the occupied 
territories with east jerusalem as its capital

prime minister toshiki kaifu said tuesday that he 
and six members of his new cabinet had received more than 300000 
in donations from recruit co the information service conglomerate 
at the center of an influencepeddling scandal 
all of these donations had been received before the recruit 
co became the target of public criticism kaifu said during 
questioning by opposition legislators in parliament they present 
no problem in terms of the governing liberal democratic partys 
internal standards either 
last spring two prime ministers resigned over their ties to the 
company and a major election loss by the ruling liberal 
democratics was blamed in part on voters upset with politicians 
receipt of funds from recruit 
three cabinet members also resigned who were linked to the 
scandal and the partys senior leaders were forced to adopt a low 
profile clearing the way for the rise of kaifu who came to office 
with a clean image and promises of political reforms 
kaifu told a socialist party questioner that seven ministers in 
his cabinet formed last tuesday had received a total of 325300 
in donations from recruit which has been accused of trying to buy 
influence mainly with sales of cutprice stock to influential 
politicians and businessmen 
kaifu listed himself as the largest recipient with 96000 
followed by director general of the national land agency moriyoshi 
sato who had received 93300 
donations to chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto finance 
minister ryutaro hashimoto labor minister shunpei tsukahara 
transport minister akira oho and director general of the hokkaido 
and okinawa development agencies tamisuke sunada ranged from 4000 
to 59300 he said 
sakamonto told a news conference all the donations were legal 
our party decided last year that we did not have to disclose 
ordinary political donations and the purchase of fundraising party 
tickets he said as long as no one was asked to give favors 
nor has given any i think they should be treated as ordinary 
donations 
kaifu had sought to keep politicians linked to the recruit case 
or other scandals out of his administration in forming his new 
cabinet after his partys feb 18 election victory he showed 
unexpected assertiveness in resisting pressure from party elders to 
give cabinet posts to two such men 
in connection with the stock deals which involved shares not 
yet offered for public sale 12 politicians public officials and 
recruit executives have been indicted on bribery charges

president bush and italian prime minister 
giulio andreotti on tuesday discussed the emerging new order in 
europe and reaffirmed that the germanpolish border and all current 
borders must be respected 
andreotti who has urged a larger role for all the nato allies 
in discussions leading to german unification hailed what he called 
the dawn of democracy in eastern europe 
new balances lie on the horizon full of promise yet also 
fraught with problems the italian leader said after bush 
welcomed him to the white house with military honors 
by updating and reviving the spirit and the model of nato and 
helsinki we must all together seize the challenges that are facing 
us andreotti said 
bush said the united states and italy agree on the foundations 
of a new europe and look to the 35nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe to play a greater role in europes 
future particularly in guiding the economic and political 
transformation of the rising democracies in eastern europe 
later the white house announced the united states had accepted 
a west german proposal for a twoplusfour meeting of 
subcabinet officials to discuss procedures for more substantive 
talks on german unification spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
meeting may be held march 14 in bonn but that the date and 
location were not definite 
the twoplusfour are the two germanys and the four allied 
powers that defeated nazi germany in world war ii the united 
states great britain france and the soviet union 
the twoplusfour formula agreed to by the four powers 
ministers in ottawa last month has stirred concern in rome and 
other capitals left out of the equation 
andreotti told italian reporters after his white house talks 
that established institutions such as nato should not be replaced 
by what he called a directorate he said he favors convening 
the 16nation nato alliance before its customary meeting in may 
a spokesman for andreotti pio mastrobuoni said bush assured 
the prime minister that the aim of the four powers meeting would 
be to put an end to their special rights over germany 
asked by a reporter at the outset of the oval office talks with 
bush whether the twoplusfour formula gave italy a sufficient 
voice in german unification andreotti said 
its not a problem which belongs to italy i think that all 
the member countries of the atlantic alliance must handle together 
these problems 
the specific problems related to berlin must be handled by the 
four countries that won world war ii he said 
the state department said the twoplusfour formula would not be 
expanded to include italy poland or any of the other smaller 
countries 
raymond seitz the assistant secretary of state for european and 
canadian affairs told reporters that bush and andreotti 
discusssed the question of borders and the need in an emerging 
european order that all borders are accepted 
seitz said bush made abundantly clear that the 
twoplusfour mechanism is not regarded in any fashion as a 
substitute for a legitimate discussion of alliance concerns in 
nato 
andreotti had lunch with secretary of state james a baker iii 
at the state department and later returned to the white house for a 
blacktie state dinner where bush said i can think of no time 
in modern history when our strong transatlantic partnership was 
more crucial 
andreotti toasting bush in return called for a new 
solidarity between the united states and europe he 
reiterated his call for a broader framework for cooperation 
based upon the helsinki formula and nato to deal with a europe 
where ideological and military confrontations wane 
he was to address a joint meeting of congress on wednesday and 
receive an honorary degree from catholic university before 
departing thursday for latin america and stops in the dominican 
republic chile argentina and brazil 
andreotti became prime minister in july for the sixth time 
leading italys 49th postwar government italy will assume the 
presidency of the 12nation european community this july 
andreotti said in rome last week that he did not fear that a 
united germany would turn belligerent but was concerned that 
interest rates could be driven up when west germany tries to help 
east german development 
andreotti also met with us trade representative carla hills 
attorney general dick thornburgh and treasury secretary nicholas 
brady 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee shelved a resolution calling on germany to 
stick to its present borders saying the rush of events made it 
unnecessary 
in bonn west german chancellor helmut kohls government moved 
to still the border controversy by unveiling a proposed 
parliamentary resolution saying a united germany should sign a 
treaty with poland guaranteeing it would not try to recover 
territory taken away after the war

exxon valdez skipper joseph hazelwood 
probably was drunk when his tanker ran aground and triggered the 
nations worst oil spill a toxicologist testified tuesday 
richard prouty chief forensic toxicologist with the medical 
examiners office in oklahoma said he calculated that hazelwoods 
blood alcohol level would have been 14 percent at 1205 am on 
march 24 when the oil tanker ran aground on a reef in prince 
william sound 
the legal limit in alaska for operating a motor vehicle is 10 
percent 
the us coast guard has a limit of 04 for operating a 
commercial vessel but jurors were not told of the regulation 
because federal law is not involved in the state charges against 
hazelwood 
the question of whether hazelwood was drunk has been described 
by his lawyers as the keystone of the case because it reflects on 
whether he acted recklessly as captain of the ship the defense 
contends hazelwood wasnt drunk 
assistant district attorney brent cole asked whether prouty 
would consider a person with a blood alcohol level of 14 to be 
impaired in reasoning and making decisions 
it is my opinion they definitely would be impaired prouty 
said 
prouty was called as the final witness in the prosecutions case 
against hazelwood but his crossexamination was put off until 
wednesday 
earlier hazelwoods attorney suggested that an expert witness 
designed calculations to show the tanker would capsize drawing a 
heated response from the witness 
i did not contrive the calculations to show the ship would 
sink said william vorus a professor of naval architecture at 
the university of michigan 
hazelwood 43 is charged with criminal mischief reckless 
endangerment operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent 
discharge of oil the seaman from huntington ny faces up to 7 
years in prison and 61000 in fines if convicted 
the exxon valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude devastating the rich wildlife in prince william sound 
the most serious charge against hazelwood is second degree 
criminal mischief which involves acting recklessly in disregarding 
a known risk cole has focused on hazelwoods behavior after the 
grounding to prove this charge with witnesses saying the skipper 
ordered the engines turned on and the ship pointed forward 
some witnesses have said taking the ship off the rocks would 
cause it to capsize or sink 
but in a brief filed with the judge monday defense attorney 
dick madson argued there was no risk that the ship would come off 
the reef and hazelwood could not have disregarded a risk that 
didnt exist 
vorus acknowledged he did not figure into his calculations any 
actions the crew of the stranded tanker might have taken to prevent 
sinking if the ship got off a jagged reef that hung it up and 
ruptured its tanks 
there was no indication the crew was doing any of the things 
you indicated he told attorney michael chalos 
and there was no indication the vessel was coming off the 
reef either was there asked chalos 
under a slightly different situation the vessel could have 
come off the reef said vorus 
but like other prosecution experts who testified before him 
vorus agreed the ship was stuck solidly on bligh reef and the 
scenario he created in which the ship was refloated and sank was 
hypothetical 
do you agree it couldnt come off the reef asked chalos 
obviously it didnt come off and thats as good a proof as 
any that it wouldnt come off vorus said 
before he concluded his testimony vorus attempted to make a 
strong protest of the defense attorneys implications that the 
witnesses calculations were scripted by the prosecution 
i object to the accusations that are being put forth here 
declared the witness i think the state conducted itself most 
properly in this case 
chalos objected that the witness is making a speech but 
superior court judge karl johnstone allowed the comments to stand 
vorus earlier was allowed to give jurors an elaborate account of 
a computer simulation of the grounding the witness who said his 
engineering firm was being paid 40000 by the state for its work 
on the hazelwood prosecution gave a scholarly account about how a 
ship stays afloat he calculated that the exxon valdez would have 
capsized 75 minutes after grounding if it was freed from the reef 
in 10 minutes

ron kovic the disabled vietnam veteran whose 
life was chronicled in the film born on the fourth of july 
said tuesday he will not run for congress 
kovic gave no explanation for his decision against challenging 
conservative republican rep robert dornan of garden grove saying 
only in a statement released by an assistant ive decided not to 
run 
kovic 43 nominated for an oscar for cowriting the screenplay 
for the oliver stone film was recruited by democrats to run for 
the seat held by conservative republican robert dornan of garden 
grove 
the filing deadline for candidacy is friday afternoon 
the first word that kovic was not running came in a telephone 
call he made tuesday morning to tim carpenter an organizer for the 
group peace politics who helped with kovics exploratory campaign 
for the orange county congressional seat 
he said im sorry but im not going to do it said 
carpenter i said i wish you would but i look forward to 
working with you sometime in the future 
im real disappointed said county democratic chairman 
michael balmages who had not talked to kovic but was told by two 
good sources that kovic was not running 
balmages said he would be talking to two or three other possible 
candidates who had been staying out of the running while kovic was 
a possible candidate balmages would not offer any names 
dornan whose strong support of defense projects earned him the 
nickname b1 bob was not immediately available for comment 
tom cruise who played kovic in born on the fourth of july 
had intended to help kovic campaign had kovic decided to seek the 
position 
dornan took the possible kovic challenge seriously sending out 
20000 fundraising letters that portrayed kovic as a draft card 
burning ultraliberal 
dornan wrote that born on the fourth of july offered a 
number of reasons to vote against kovic the film based on a book 
by kovic traces his life from being a strong supporter of the 
vietnam war to a disillusioned antiwar activist 
the movie shows kovic in a panic and mistakenly shooting his 
corporal to death in vietnam visiting prostitutes abusing drugs 
and alcohol and cruelly insulting his parents the letter said 
and this is a person the liberals want in the us congress no 
way

the supreme court on tuesday granted 
bail to sen juan ponce enrile the opposition leader who was 
arrested in connection with decembers bloody coup attempt but it 
delayed ruling on the validity of a charge against him 
the decision appeared to be a setback for president corazon 
aquinos government which accused enrile last week of rebellion 
with murder 
the court said bail was granted because the chances were 
fairly remote that enrile would flee the country but the panel 
said it made no determination on whether rebellion and murder could 
be charged together 
enriles lawyers argued that a 1956 supreme court decision 
nullified the joint charge one justice speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the court would meet in a few weeks to review the 
1956 ruling 
lawyers for enrile said they expect the court to decide on the 
dual charge within the month 
late tuesday enriles lawyers presented his release order to 
authorities and he walked out of the suburban northern police 
headquarters where he has been jailed since last week 
like a jailed bird that has just been set free ill fly away 
happily enrile said while signing autographs for police officers 
before boarding his bulletproof van 
in a radio interview wednesday enrile called the case against 
him unbelievable he said the courts decision to release him 
without deciding the merits of the charge was done so as not to 
embarrass the government 
i am praying for our president for enlightenment enrile 
said she is in a very difficult situation because she does 
not know everything that is happening around her 
after a threehour hearing tuesday 10 justices voted in favor 
of granting 4650 bail each to enrile and two codefendants hotel 
owner rebecco panlilio and his wife four other justices voted to 
deny bail and one abstained 
rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years in prison and 
defendants are eligible for bail murder carries a life sentence 
and bail is not allowed 
enrile and six others were indicted feb 27 in the dec 19 coup 
attempt in which at least 113 people were killed and more than 600 
injured enrile denies any role 
some of enriles colleagues in the senate criticized how the 
government handled the case 
sen ernesto maceda a lawyer said enrile should have been 
charged only with rebellion 
then maybe there would not have been any problems in turning 
enrile into a martyr and a hero the result of the administrations 
decision to file a complex case is really bad maceda said 
enrile was charged after witnesses claimed they saw former lt 
col gregorio gringo honasan a rebellion leader at enriles 
home on the first day of the coup attempt the panlilios were also 
allegedly at the enrile home on dec 1 
during the hearing about 200 enrile sympathizers gathered 
outside the courthouse carrying signs reading justice for 
enrile a group of antienrile demonstrators rallied at another 
gate and hundreds of armed police stood guard in the building and 
nearby streets 
inside one of enriles lawyers former supreme court justice 
serafin cuevas argued that the detention of the opposition senator 
is illegal and unconstitutional 
we say so because the information under which he was charged 
and sought to be prosecuted is for an offense that does not exist 
in our law books cuevas added 
solicitor gen francisco chavez argued that the law does allow 
for a dual charge if a single act involves two or more grave or 
less grave felonies 
he recommended that the court reconsider the 1956 ruling 
what we have here is disgruntled members of the armed 
forces military adventurists plain and simply power grabbers 
as defense minister enrile led the february 1986 mutiny that 
precipitated the people power revolution that swept mrs aquino 
to power he was fired nine months later after a failed coup by his 
followers 
among those indicted with enrile was suspended provincial gov 
rodolfo aguinaldo on sunday officials tried to arrest aguinaldo 
in tuguegarao 250 miles north of manila 
but aguinaldos forces seized a hotel taking government 
representative brig gen oscar florendo hostage and trapping 
several officials on the upper floors florendo was slain during 
fighting to retake the hotel and aguinaldo fled during the clash 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered troops to 
capture aguinaldo at all costs

the internal revenue service has served summonses on criminal 
defense attorneys around the country demanding that they reveal the 
names of clients who paid large lawyer fees with cash an irs 
official confirmed tuesday 
lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate the 
fundamental right of attorneyclient privilege 
the attorneys were told to bring their financial records to irs 
offices according to miami attorney neal sonnett president of the 
national association of criminal defense lawyers one lawyer served 
said an irs agent told him that 900 lawyers were to receive 
summonses 
we have heard from enough lawyers around the country to 
recognize that it appears to be a nationwide assault upon criminal 
defense lawyers said sonnett whose organization knows of 12 
lawyers who were served i think theres hundreds of 
attorneys who will go to jail for this 
in october the irs sent letters to about 940 criminal defense 
attorneys requesting information on clients who paid them more than 
10000 in cash sonnett said 
the letter signed by christopher j lezovich an irs official 
in detroit was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30 
days to identify the clients it also included a warning that 
noncompliance would result in summonses 
tax collectors are acting under a disclosure law passed by 
congress in 1985 the law initially widely ignored was aimed at 
exposing tax evaders including major drug dealers who often 
transact business in cash 
the original penalties for failure to disclose were only 
misdemeanors but a year ago congress reclassified violations as 
felonies punishable by up to 10 years in prison 
the summonses received by lawyers on tuesday were signed by 
local irs agents sonnett said 
lezovich said tuesday night that the detroit irs office within 
the past 10 days wrote to field offices to advise them that agents 
might want to serve summonses against the lawyers who received the 
letters in october 
we got some back some provided the information some didnt 
of those some were selected for the first wave of summonses he 
said the detroit irs office is one of the agencys main computer 
centers and it processes form 8300 which among other things 
requests that filers list cash sums of at least 10000 they have 
received 
we anticipate that was just a first cut this isnt going to 
be the end of it lezovich said of the summonses 
justice department spokesman david runkel said his department 
took part in discussions last year with the irs and lawyers groups 
on the issue 
its very clear what the issue is here it grows out of 
concerns about drug payments runkel said 
sonnett said the summonses request that attorneys bring all 
their financial records including bank statements and payment 
records and not just bookkeeping related to the federal 8300 forms 
i cannot conceive of a summons that is more blatantly a 
fishing expedition which in effect asks the lawyer to turn over 
all his financial records to the irs to roam through he said 
john wesley hall a criminal defense lawyer in little rock said 
revenue agent john w prather jr of little rock indicated that a 
nationwide move by the irs was under way against 900 lawyers who 
refused to reveal the names of clients 
hall said he would not comply with the demand of the summons 
the summons served on hall directed him to bring all his bank 
records from 1987 to 1989 to the irs office in little rock on march 
27 
talk about overreaching hall said adding that he has had 
two clients pay him more than 10000 each during the last three 
years the summons involves one of them he said 
the privilege of the lawyerclient relationship is not only 
granted in state law but also is a constitutional privilege hall 
said 
i believe i am dutybound not to provide the requested 
information hall said

saudi arabians gave 2 million in two 
donations to nancy reagans war on drugs providing more than half 
of the money raised for her antidrug fund according to a report

a jury on tuesday convicted lebaneseborn charles 
yacoub on two charges arising from his hijacking of a new 
yorkbound bus to parliament hill last april and holding police at 
bay for eight hours before surrendering 
all 10 hostages on the bus eventually were released unharmed 
after more than 17 hours of deliberations the jury convicted 
yacoub 33 of forcible confinement which carries a maximum 
sentence of 10 years in prison and use of a weapon to commit an 
offense which carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison and 
a maximum of 10 years 
he was acquitted of charges of hostagetaking which could have 
brought a sentence of life in prison intimidation of parliament 
and aggravated assault 
yacoub who sat without emotion in court while the jury rendered 
the verdict was held in custody to await sentencing 
in his closing arguments in the supreme court of ontario monday 
defense lawyer michael kastner contended that while yacoub was 
responsible for the incident he had no criminal intent because of 
his mental state 
psychiatrists described yacoub as suffering from hypomania a 
reaction to depression in which people are driven by uncontrollable 
thoughts to do irrational things 
justice jeancharles sirois reminded jurors that some passengers 
testified they were terrified during the incident 
i suggest to you that acts of violence were committed and that 
all passengers were traumatized by their confinement sirois said 
yacoub who came to canada from lebanon in 1976 and lived in 
repentigny quebec near montreal used a 45caliber pistol to 
pull off the hijacking 
kastner said that while he would have preferred a complete 
acquittal the verdict was a victory because yacoub was acquitted 
of the most serious charges the lawyer indicated he will appeal 
the verdict and will also request bail 
hes not a terrorist kastner said outside the courtroom 
hes a jeweler from montreal and was in a state of irresistible 
impulse when he committed this 
the court was told yacoub hijacked the greyhound bus to bring 
attention to the fighting in wartorn lebanon his homeland 
he commandeered a bus bound for new york city from montreal at 
about noon on april 7 and forced the driver to take it to ottawa 
where it wound up on the front lawn of parliament hill initially 
nine passengers and the driver were held as hostages 
yacoub was demanding withdrawal of syrian troops from lebanon 
the court was told 
crown attorney julianne parfett said yacoub was a terrorist and 
should have been convicted of all charges against him

many lenders will soon offer a new type of 
mortgage designed to appeal to home buyers who expect to move 
within seven years but want the security of a fixedrate mortgage 
in case they dont 
the loans called twostep mortgages are a cross between an 
adjustablerate loan where the rate can change every one three or 
five years and a traditional 30year mortgage where the interest 
rate does not change for the life of the loan 
in the first step of the new mortgage borrowers pay an interest 
rate up to threeeighths of a percentage point lower than on a 
30year fixedrate loan after seven years the rate is reset at 
225 to 25 percentage points higher than the rate on 10year 
treasury notes 
on a typical mortgage of 83000 home buyers currently would 
save 23 a month or 1932 over the first seven years however 
the rate for the remaining 23 yearsof the mortgage likely would be 
somewhat higher than on a new 30year loan taken out at 
readjustment time

opponents of a new federal law making it a 
crime to burn the american flag scored another victory when a 
second federal judge ruled that the statute runs afoul of the 
constitution 
but mondays ruling by us district judge june green here also 
gives proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning 
more political ammunition for their cause 
president bush endorsed the amendment route to undo last years 
supreme court ruling that struck down a texas flagburning law 
saying he was unsure that the statute congress passed instead would 
survive court challenges 
so far bush and other supporters of a constitutional amendment 
have been proven correct

study found 
for example a oneminute lowtech nocost technique is to 
ask students at the end of each class for a quick oneparagraph 
summary of what they learned said richard j light author of the

the study concludes that modest shifts in academic policies can 
create major improvements in college classrooms 
light a professor at harvards graduate school of education and

the rare ritual of exorcism practiced twice by 
the new york archdiocese in a year is cloaked in mystery even for 
those most familiar with it but priests say the movie the 
exorcist depicted it pretty well 
a lot of people think they know the answer but my experience 
is nobody really does said the rev john nicola a priest with 
the washington archdiocese who assisted at four exorcisms in rome 
from 1973 to 1975 
he added even psychiatrists who have no belief in the 
supernatural will tell you about cases 
catholic theologians expressed surprise monday that cardinal 
john j oconnor reported the two new york exorcisms he made the 
disclosure during a sunday sermon at st patricks cathedral in 
which he said diabolically instigated violence is on the rise

texacos 50year love affair with the 
metropolitan opera is being celebrated on both radio and television 
in concerts highlighting memorable moments from past performances 
on radio a live gala will take the place of the regular 
saturday afternoon opera broadcast march 10 on the 
texacometropolitan opera radio network more than a dozen singers 
and six conductors will perform arias ensembles and overtures that 
have been favorites during the 50 years of texaco sponsorship 
on television the public broadcasting service is offering 
great moments from the met culled from the nearly 50 operas 
televised since 1977 thanks to funding from texaco the show is 
being made available to pbs stations for use anytime during the 
march 1990 pledge drive 
great moments is packed with as much vocal talent as anyone 
could ask for luciano pavarotti and placido domingo are 
represented twice each and so are kathleen battle jessye norman 
and samuel ramey all are in excellent voice as they perform arias 
or duets from favorite roles 
but somehow the whole adds up to considerably less than the 
sum of its parts 
part of the problem is that we cant appreciate these artists 
fully just hearing snippets of their work worse even the snippets 
are interrupted by voiceovers as the performers give us their 
mostly superfluous views on what the characters they are portraying 
are all about 
im going to do this opera until i cant pavarotti tells us 
eagerly but uninformatively about donizettis lelisir 
damore miss norman discussing the title role of strauss 
ariadne auf naxos discloses the surprising news that i 
always empathize with all of the characters that i sing 
the unquestionable highlight of the telecast is leontyne prices 
farewell performance in 1984 of aidas third act aria o patria 
mia not only was the soprano in unusually fine voice her 
comments about the occasion made in an interview during the last 
year are deeply moving 
for the rest of my life whenever i view the tape of that 
final performance i cant possibly be unhappy the soprano says 
tears welling in her eyes i really get goose pimples just 
thinking of it now 
the other singer who comes off well is teresa stratas heard in 
two wildly differing roles the gentle tragic mimi of puccinis 
la boheme and the hardbitten prostitute jenny in the kurt 
weillbertolt brecht rise and fall of the city of mahagonny 
miss stratas is worth listening to even when shes not singing 
she brings a rare insight and intensity to her discussion of the 
operas 
the program ends with another maddeningly incomplete excerpt 
part of the farewell scene from act three of wagners die 
walkuere sung by hildegard behrens and james morris this as 
host f murray abraham reminds us is but a tease for the upcoming 
complete telecast of the mets ring cycle on four consecutive 
nights in june 
the texaco radio concert cant match the tv productions star 
power but it will have the advantage of being live and 
spontaneous its so spontaneous in fact that the final program 
was being nailed down a week before the broadcast 
originally we were going to have recorded highlights and 
interviews but as the anniversary season became more and more 
important we decided to have the live concert explained charles 
sheek the mets associate press representative 
so what was printed on the season schedule as a performance of 
gounods faust instead became a special event the cast was 
assembled mostly from singers already in town for performances or 
rehearsals 
we tried to choose artists in roles they became well known 
for and some operas that have an important broadcast history 
sheek said 
the concert will open with met artistic director james levine 
conducting the overture to mozarts le nozze di figaro the 
very first met opera broadcast under texaco sponsorship in 1940 
other likely highlights 
marilyn horne singing from rosinas aria from rossinis il 
barbiere di siviglia an opera the great mezzo is retiring from 
her repertory 
carol vanness singing fiordiligis aria come scoglio from 
mozarts cosi fan tutte 
dolores ziegler a recent met debutante singing the 
composers aria from strauss ariadne auf naxos 
kurl moll in dalands lobst du mein kind from wagners 
der fliegende hollaender 
ashley putnam francisco araiza and samuel ramey in the final 
trio from faust 
dawn upshaw singing no word from tom from stravinskys 
the rakes progress 
the everpresent placido domingo will be taking part in this 
concert too but not as a singer hes one of the six conductors 
who will take turns leading the met orchestra

in television ratings talk the numbers are 
down way down for communism in the east bloc and liberated 
audiences are ready for their first glimpse of santa barbara 
and other bourgeois decadence 
expatriate soviets american television executives including 
garfields animator and a cable company headed by a polish 
concentration camp escapee are among those trying to grab a piece 
of the new marketplace 
others arent sure eastern european and soviet audiences are 
worth the stretch for commercial television 
they have no money so it will be quite some time before it 
approaches a meaningful market warned colin davis the head of 
mca television international some have taken the approach of 
giving them a show and then sharing in advertising revenue but 
there isnt much advertising because there isnt much in the way of 
consumer goods 
conduit internationale films has offered the wonder years 
and the soap opera santa barbara to newly established polish 
commercial television channel 2 
the shows will begin airing this month while conduit tries to 
drum up international advertising one primetime minute on polish 
television sells for 6500 with the revenue to be split between 
conduit the program supplier and the polish television firm 
conduit claims 10000 television households in poland 
robert spinner head of conduits advertising push said he 
believes the television and consumer markets will grow 
simultaneously in poland 
i dont see it as a great market for bmws but for lowcost 
items such as cosmetics soap cold remedies and soft drinks its a 
good market spinner said 
while conduit will seek to program standard airwave channels 
another american company chase enterprises of hartford conn is 
installing television cable lines in poland and hungary 
headed by polishborn david chase who survived four world war 
ii concentration camps including auschwitz before escaping the 
media company recently signed a deal giving it 70 percent of the 
polish cable franchise with 30 percent under control by a 
government consortium 
in all likelihood there will not be an immediate gold mine 
conceded arnold chase davids son there are still problems to 
be overcome and there are still changes going on but the changes 
are for the positive 
the son estimated the cost for cabling poland at 900 million 
the company last week also entered into a similar cable agreement 
with hungary roughly estimated to cost 250 million 
soviet television has had a few experimental broadcasts of 
american programming and russian media experts in the united 
states predict there will someday be a market for commercial 
american shows in their country 
but the current effort to establish western television in the 
soviet union involves coproductions bringing american and west 
european cash in exchange for lowcost soviet talent and studios 
film roman the burbank califbased animation studio that 
turns out the garfield cartoon series and specials has signed 
an agreement with the soviets establishing a 10000square foot 
studio outside moscow 
the move is the latest quest by american animation studios to 
find cheaper labor outside the country in recent years said film 
roman chief executive officer phil roman film animation 
contracting has traveled from japan to korea to taiwan 
the soviet animation artists will do backgrounds ink paint and 
camera work with postproduction such as adding character voices 
and sound effects handled back in the united states 
they offer very high animation at a very reasonable price 
they get paid two or three times what they are normally making and 
the cost is still below what it is for us in the far east said 
roman they want to be recognized outside the soviet union and 
their country needs the hard currency 
television movies and miniseries planned for filming in the 
soviet union by american companies such as mgmua television and 
fries entertainment are coordinated by a recently established ussr 
film service in los angeles 
efforts targeted for this year include a production on the 
chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster and a miniseries on a joint 
ussoviet space flight to mars 
yuri spilny who left the soviet union in 1972 heads the ussr 
film service office making sure american producers get what they 
need from the soviet unions 39 studios he believes american shows 
will find a way to soviet viewers 
lifestyles of the rich and famous now that would be like 
a fantasy night for soviet television spilny joked 
its just a question of time they have a huge audience there 
an american film could be seen there by 200 million television 
viewers said ilmar taska who will produce the presentation of 
the best foreign film oscar from moscow for the 62nd annual academy 
awards 
the same way as mcdonalds has crossed over american 
television will come to the soviet network as well

entrepreneur chris graff wants the world to 
know he can build a better bedframe but his trademarked 
bedfellows at first glance a collection of oddly twisted metal 
tubes doesnt look like a bedframe 
he believes thats his problem 
graff finds that largely indifferent manufacturers sales reps 
and customers are suggesting he give the idea a rest the path to 
his office door at geste corp hasnt been beaten smooth 
its been pretty cold all across the board he says 
so it often goes when inventors and business venturers attempt 
to sell the public a new twist on an old idea say patent attorneys 
and marketing experts 
customers are reluctant to change marketers are slow to see the 
new products brilliance at least from the inventors point of 
view those whose fortunes are tied to conventional products may 
battle the upstart competition 
with a lot of innovative products regardless of their 
performance and the benefits they provide that is the wall the 
innovator keeps running up against says scott jessup who 
teaches entrepreneurship at the university of notre dame 
in the world of sponsored research each patentable idea may 
cost at least 5 million purdue university figures show a 
corporate portfolio containing hundreds of patents may include only 
a few that actually make money 
its tough for the big fish and even harder for the small fry 
more than 40 years ago preston tucker introduced an automobile 
that bore his name and offered motorists a fourdoor fastback with 
a rear engine and headlights that turned with the steering wheel 
only 51 cars were produced and tuckers dream died mired in 
securities and exchange commission fraud charges that ended in an 
acquittal 
detroit inventor robert w kearns developed intermittent 
windshield wipers in the 1960s only to discover automakers werent 
interested he went to court in the 1980s after the wipers became 
standard equipment and recently won a judgment against ford motor 
co 
graff bought the patent rights to bedfellows last year and so 
far has sold little more than 250 sets for under 30 his chief 
competition is the standard hollywood bedframe that sells for about 
the same price there the similarities end 
the bedframe doesnt look remotely like one it more resembles 
sets of bicycle handlebars put together and fastened to the 
underside of a box spring mattress its advantages over a 
conventional frame says graff are considerable 
bedfellows for a fullsize boxspring weighs about six pounds 
onefourth the weight of a standard frame that cuts into the 
considerable costs of shipping and eases the chores of storage and 
store display says graff 
customers get a break too the assembled frame is easier to 
move even with mattress and box springs because the weight is 
distributed on eight points instead of four 
its odd configuration eliminates exposed rails and legs ending 
the ageold menace of stubbed toes and barked shins ive bumped 
my toe enough times in the middle of the night to realize there 
some merit there graff says 
jessup president of an investment banking firm concedes hes 
nearly lost a few toes on conventional bedframes himself but 
would i go out and buy that it would take a pretty significant 
experience to take that leap of faith 
disappointed expectations arise sometimes from unrealistic 
hopes say patent and marketing experts some inventors wildly 
inflate the value of an idea that makes a product only marginally 
more salable 
but graff persists looking for new marketing outlets 
ive lost money so far but you dont plan on making money 
this far into the project he says im convinced its a good 
product and once the consumer gets ahold of it

foreigners tell of the tourist who 
visited draculas castle in transylvania and was awakened the first 
night by a caped figure 
he was terrified he trembled as the figure approached its 
mouth open fangs dripping blood 
it spoke change money 
communist dictator nicolae ceausescu imposed harsh penalties on 
moneychangers but they thrive on the flood of journalists and 
other foreigenrs who have arrived since he was overthrown and 
executed in december 
one dollar buys 20 lei at the official rate but 70 on the black 
market and rates of up to 160 have been reported from the 
countryside 
most foreigners stay at the intercontinental hotel which used 
to be offlimits to the average romanian and crawling with agents 
of the securitate ceausescus hated secret police 
now it crawls with moneychangers who have a much easier time 
of it than during ceausecus 24 years in power 
all romanians were required to report contacts with foreigners 
and strict limits were put on possession of hard currency they had 
to deposit all hard currency in special accounts and explain where 
they got it 
since the revolution moneychangers appear wherever there is a 
demand the unofficial exchange of currency remains illegal but 
the authorities are choosing to ignore it at least for the moment 
moneychangers seem a sign of the new times like bucharests 
first privately owned businesses a clothing store and photography 
shop that opened in february 
they pursue their trade in hotels taxis restaurants on the 
street and occasionally diversify 
one approached a canadian reporter in a hotel lobby and offered 
to sell an antique russian icon later he offered an american a 
gold french cigarette lighter 
two others tried to peddle a gold watch they claimed had been 
ceausescus 
you have to make a living said one who identified himself 
as velentin around here where a manager makes maybe 4200 lei a 
month 60 at the black market rate you starve if you dont find 
all kinds of ways to make money 
there have been reports of moneychangers trying to cheat 
foreigners by offering what appear to be large rolls of money 
100lei notes on the outside and toilet paper on the inside 
another common trick is for the moneychanger to stop a 
transaction suddenly explaining that the rate has changed or 
someone is watching then try to return a 1 bill instead of the 
50 or 100 the foreigner was exchanging 
one sunday protesters forced their way into the government 
headquarters in victory square ransacked it and trapped gelu 
voican the deputy prime minister in his office for several hours 
several foreign reporters and about 20 soldiers were in a group 
that joined voican in the office 
a photographer pointed to a tall dark man and said hes 
familiar 
in a few minutes the man edged up to a reporter and said 
change money

a few decades ago errol flynn was charged with the rape of a 
pair of teenage girls he was acquitted and robert mitchum was 
busted for smoking marijuana he served time 
the scandals seemed capable of destroying the stars careers 
but their studios put them in heroic roles and flynn and mitchum 
became more popular than before 
that brings us to bad influence starring rob lowe yes the 
rob lowe who got in a jam by videotaping sex between a couple of 
young women in an atlanta hotel room 
far from being a hero in bad influence lowe plays a totally 
immoral figure capable of deceit robbery and murder in the film 
he videotapes sex between two of the other protagonists and uses 
the tape for a shocking purpose in a later scene he lands in bed 
with two nubile and eager beauties 
exploitive some may think so a new furor may arise perhaps 
obscuring the fact that bad influence is a crackerjack suspense 
movie 
the great hitchock comes to mind he loved outlandish 
situations such as the chase across mount rushmore in north by 
northwest in bad influence two brothers try to dispose of a 
body in los angeles famed la brea tar pits the films theme is 
basic hitchcock normal citizen finds himself enmeshed in a deadly 
game 
james spader is a marketing analyst successful in his work and 
engaged to the rich beautiful kathleen wilhoite his life is 
wellordered until an encounter in a beach bar with lowe a 
ruthless charmer who takes over spaders life teaching him to 
outfox his office rivals and introducing him to a dangerous beauty 
lisa zane 
lowe introduces spader to fast living drugs and los angeles 
undergound nightlife then to criminal acts spader restores his 
senses and tries to escape but to his horror he becomes involved 
in murder 
bad influence might have been just another exercise in the 
destructive fastlane life of los angeles but david koepp has 
fashioned a screenplay filled with unexpected turns and shocks and 
curtis hanson directed in taut style aided immeasurably by robert 
elswits stunning photography 
spader sex lies and videotape draws an impressive 
characterization of a man in a quagmire lowe whose previous work 
has seemed vapid and colorless corrects that impression this time 
out he is profoundly evil as the protean drifter 
steve tisch directed the epic production which bears a 
welldeserved r for nudity sex violence drugs and language

25 x 5 the continuing adventures of the rolling stones cbs 
music video vhs 1998 no rating 
 
it was image that counted keith richards recalls in the 
video documentary 25 x 5 the continuing adventures of the 
rolling stones 
we were very hip to image and how to manipulate the press 
richards was referring to the mid1960s when the stones were 
presented as the dangerous alternative to the lovable beatles even 
though as mick jagger points out they were just as cynical as 
we were 
visits to childrens hospitals were kept secret such headlines 
as would you let your daughter marry a rolling stone 
encouraged hostility 
what mood do we have today richards says of those times 
speaking like a seasoned campaign manager 
image still counts call this video beat the press the 
continuing adventures of rock n roll spin doctors like so many 
authorized biographies 25 x 5 is a documentary of selective 
candor the truth is told but never the whole truth good times 
bad times the stones get the last word 
youll learn what kind of car bill wyman owned in 1966 and how 
former manager allen klein bullied executives into giving the 
stones the best contract in the world youll also learn that 
jagger would be happy to resume his acting career if of course 
he received the right part 
theres not a word about classic albums such as aftermath 
and let it bleed but there are highlights from the weddings of 
richards wyman and ron wood with only wyman including an oath of 
fidelity and lectures on the importance of family 
jimmy miller who produced beggars banquet sticky 
fingers and exiles on main street among others is ignored 
chuck berry gets a single mention the lowest point comes when 
jagger brushes off the tragic 1969 concert at altamont during 
which a young fan was murdered by hells angels with the comment 
it still doesnt sully the tour for me 
as the stones tell it the real secret to their success was 
manager andrew loog oldham who boasted of their nasty habits and 
klein who pushed them ahead financially 
i just wanted to get the point of view from the guys 
perspective explained producer andrew solt whose previous 
credits include imagine john lennon this is elvis and the 
acclaimed heroes of rock n roll 
they really were hip to the press solt said the press 
was critical to this process they were bad boys to an extent but 
they certainly werent as bad as they were supposed to be 
the press falls for it lets get down to brass tacks a 
reporter asks an obviously delighted jagger are you better at 
what you do than the beatles are at what they do 
are you satisfied another reporter asks jagger 
sexually satisfied financially not satisfied 
philosophically trying is the response 
the more sophisticated dick cavett can come up with nothing 
better to ask than will jagger be performing satisfaction as an 
old man 
the stones look happiest on stage and the video would work 
better if the interviews were simply edited out just watch 
richards bob his head and grin as the band rips through around 
and around or jagger step into satisfaction and later prowl 
the stage during midnight rambler wonderful clips of bluesmen 
muddy waters and howlin wolf two major influences are also 
highlights 
but the clips are usually just that only a handful of 
performances are shown all the way through and after 1972 the 
only adventures are touring making videos and finding new ways to 
keep the media on its toes 
even solt got bored 
i found it of less interest he said there were a few 
important songs and moments and events but it was more the drama 
of the band they really werent on top of their form all the 
time

la gioconda opera in four acts by amilcare ponchielli a 
three cd album cbs records 
 
what is one to make of la gioconda anyway its a 
warhorse in the worst sense of the term a clunky work with an 
absurd plot cardboard characters and some long strecthes of 
thirdrate music yet its big tunes are winners and given a strong 
recording such as this one the opera should win over plenty of 
listeners to its crude but forceful charms 
as the album notes by barrymore laurence scherer point out this 
relic is about the only surviving specimen of italian opera from 
the long period when verdi late in life temporarily retired from 
composing for the stage that would span the period between 
aida in 1871 and otello in 1887 gioconda premiered at 
la scala in 1876 
the title role of the anythingbuthappy street singer is 
powerfully sung here by eva marton like ghena dimitrova who sang 
the role at the metropolitan opera this year she exemplifies the 
stentorian rather than the lyric school of soprano singing 
thats fine since subtlety seems beside the point in portraying a 
character who from the moment the curtain rises barely stops 
rushing from one crisis to another in act 1 she frets that her 
blind mother will be burned at the stake in act 2 she tries to 
murder her romantic rival in act 3 she turns around and saves the 
rivals life in act 4 she finally stabs herself to avoid the 
sexual advances of the villain 
as enzo the noblemanindisguise whom gioconda loves tenor 
giorgio lamberti is no pavarotti but he sounds at least decent 
and better than that in his big act 2 aria cielo e mar 
baritone sherrill milnes enthusiastically throws what remains of 
his once impressive voice into the role of the evil barnaba but he 
cant avoid sounding frayed and occasionally flat 
mezzo livia budai is imposing as laura contralto anne gjevang 
does nicely by the lovely act 1 prayer ponchielli composed for la 
cieca giocondas mother and bass samuel ramey is wasted in the 
silly and entirely uninteresting part of alvise 
the late giuseppe patane conducts the hungarian state orchestra 
with the verve and smoothness for which he was renowned

jeff becks guitar shop epic jeff beck 
 
its tough these days being a guitar hero every heavy metal 
band has at least one leaving few riffs unturned 
how can a guy attract some attention with so much competition 
jeff beck who first won fame as a guitar pyrotechnician in the 
1960s decided to make studio gadgetry the cornerstone of the 
mostly instrumental jeff becks guitar shop 
bad idea the result is hightech but nosoul this music 
contains a little rock a little jazz and a lot of microchips 
beck filters his guitar through every gizmo money can buy and 
he jumps from one timbre to another for no good reason the 
synthesizers of tony hymas only reinforce the cold 21st century 
ambience 
the music works best when beck settles on one setting and just 
plays which he does a few times the slow where were you 
features a pretty melody but ends abruptly sling shot is 
propelled by reckless scorching licks and day in the house 
offers a great guitar break and even a political point of view in 
concise terms 
but most of the rest is beck dreck nothing here approaches his 
fine 70s fusion albums blow by blow and wired or his 
more recent gorgeous work on rod stewarts cover of people get 
ready beck would do well to pay less attention to knobs and 
levels and more attention to melody and rhythm

rob lowe doesnt think anyone had a worse 
summer than he did except maybe the dodgers 
lowe was trying to add lightness to a grim subject his 
involvement in a sex scandal and his efforts to resume his film 
career 
you have to have a sense of humor about it he said you 
have to look at things in the long run i knew that when this movie 
came out people would be reminded of who i am and what i do that 
is that im an actor and i do have a private life and everybodys 
private life gets out of control at one time or another 
were all human we all make mistakes i made my mistakes and 
it got away from me for a bit no different from anyone else as 
ive said before i made a mistake and i tried to live up to it i 
dont try to pretend that it never happened it did happen and we 
all go on 
every watcher of the scandal sheets and their television 
counterparts knows what happened while attending the democratic 
national convention in the summer of 1988 lowe made a videotape of 
sex involving himself and two young women in his atlanta hotel 
room claims and counterclaims rebounded and lowe agreed to do 20 
hours of community service to avoid prosecution for allegedly 
seducing one of the women then a 16yearold her mothers suit 
against lowe is pending 
the scandal is returning to the spotlight with the release of 
lowes new movie bearing the wry title of bad influence he 
portrays a charming drifter who invites a humdrum businessman 
james spader into los angeles fastlane life of drugs and 
lawlessness lowe videotapes spader in a sex episode and lowe is 
seen in bed with two women 
this is due to the totally coincidental nature of life 
imitating art and art imitating life declares steve tisch the 
movies producer its almost life and art having a headon 
collision 
lowe tried to minimize the coincidence of the two sequences 
they work so well to further the story they are plot devices 
the videotaping in the movie is to capture what happened in order 
to get somebody if the story had taken place 70 years ago i 
would have found a diary fifty years ago it would have been the 
audio recording in todays society its videotape 
its used so widely as a device in movies today sure i had a 
videotape controversy but when you consider all the movies where 
videotape is used its not really that big a deal if it had been 
an elaborate sequence we might have thought twice about removing 
it but then what would i use to trap him if not that 
curtis hanson director of bad influence commented that the 
sex scene with lowe and the two women was necessary because 
through most of the picture rob is the force who causes things to 
happen we needed to see him as a participant 
lowe was originally cast in the spader role but he opted to 
play the evil alex fashioning him after classic villains from iago 
to michael douglas gordon gekko in wall street the actor 
usually creates his own back story of his film characters but 
not this time curtis told me you cant apply the usual 
principles to someone like alex he is totally unredeemable 
bad influence was in preproduction when the atlanta scandal 
broke lowe was attending the cannes film festival and returned 
immediately to confer with tisch about continuing with the film 
lowe never considered withdrawing 
we had to do the movie he said everybody was committed 
it was still as viable a piece of material as it was before 
nothing had changed as far as the movie was concerned 
so i never looked back in that sense it only made us more 
concerned that we couldnt let what was going on in my personal 
life affect my professional life the set was the place to work we 
didnt want any distractions or for me to be distracted i 
know that the performance would not be what it is without the 
emotional ammunition i got in going through such a tough summer 
whether bad influence succeeds or not its likely that rob 
lowes persona both on and off screen will never be the same 
during his brief film career his striking good looks often cast 
him as a somewhat wimpish yuppy in his personal life he was known 
as a supporter of environmental and liberal causes and companion of 
such beauties as actress melissa gilbert and princess stephanie of 
monaco 
lowe was born in charlottesville va and grew up in dayton 
ohio where he surprised his lawyer father by announcing at 9 that 
he intended to become an actor he appeared in 30 stage plays by 
the age of 12 then his family moved to los angeles at 15 he 
appeared in a tv series a new kind of family at 18 he was 
picked by francis coppola for the outsiders 
st elmos fire provided his first adult role as a 
burnedout sax player then came about last night and square 
dance which won him a golden globe nomination as a mentally 
disabled young man 
my only consolation in losing was that sean connery won for 
the untouchables he remarked 
unlike his costar spader who shuns the media lowe faced a 
series of interviews for the films opening and responded to all 
questions he was asked if his looks had been a drawback in winning 
some roles 
im sure its possible he replied there are a lot of 
movies being made today with guys who look like they could be 
delivering your paper just average guys 
for better or worse i have a distinctive look i was born 
with it theres nothing i can do about it i personally dont give 
it a thought other than when people ask me about it in interviews 
if i had a different face they might be asking if you were only 
five inches taller 
as gilda radner used to say its always something

art patrons battling red ink and bad press 
over an exhibit of priceless imperial chinese art believe the 
investment in prestige and tourism potential was worth the loss of 
millions of private and public dollars 
the son of heaven imperial arts of china exhibit attracted 
500000 visitors during a fivemonth stint in seattle in 1988 and 
672000 during its eightmonth show in columbus last year it was 
the largest exhibition of historic chinese art and artifacts ever 
seen in the united states 
the show which opened here last march and closed in september 
featured objects from the palaces of chinese emperors and kings who 
collectively ruled over a 2600year period the works were 
primarily lent by museums in beijing and eight chinese provinces 
the pieces included lifesize terracotta horses and warrior 
sculptures from the tomb of chinas first emperor 2500yearold 
cooking vessels and temple bells delicate scroll paintings from 
the 15th century and a 2nd century jade burial suit 
some of the items were found in recent archeological digs in 
china son of heaven was chinas term for its emperors 
believed to be the human link to heaven 
unequivocally yes it was worth it to use a sports analogy 
maybe the score didnt come out quite like we thought and maybe the 
plays werent executed precisely as wed hoped but we won said 
david baker director of the ohio department of development and 
wed play the game again 
despite publicity heralding the 66 million display of 225 
artifacts spanning 26 centuries of chinese history sponsors in 
both cities who had predicted respectable profits reported stunning 
financial losses 
elling halvorson chairman of the seattlebased son of heaven 
inc said his organization lost 23 million leaving creditors 
and two charities that had pledged 1 million to the show with the 
debt 
in columbus the show lost nearly 17 million almost exactly 
the amount the state and city had pledged to guarantee creditors in 
case the exhibit lost money 
baker blamed the loss on the high cost of renovating a former 
high school to house the exhibit 
the loss prompted some ohio newspapers to delve into the 
financing of the exhibit it also focused more attention on plans 
for ameriflora 92 the citys multimilliondollar 1992 
commemoration of the 500th anniversary of christopher columbus 
arrival in the americas one local columnist already has dubbed the 
1992 event grandson of heaven 
it also surprised ohio legislators and controllers who said 
they never approved bakers promise that the state would guarantee 
1 million if the show lost money the state controlling board 
which approves many state contracts that are not competitively bid 
has delayed payment on the advice of ohio attorney general anthony 
j celebrezze jr he said such a deal was illegal 
the city has paid much of its 750000 guarantee 
baker contends that son of heaven paid off in other ways 
my departments calculations show that more taxes were paid to 
the community of columbus and the state of ohio as a result of son 
of heaven than all the public dollars going into it he said 
thats not the way we intended to pay for this but were net 
ahead on this were not behind 
but james kraft assistant director of the whitney museum of 
american art in new york said he would have been surprised had the 
shows made money 
you cant do something like this for the first time and expect 
it to be a success he said look at it as a business very 
few companies make money in the first two or three years of 
operation you have to do it once a year or once every two years to 
make it work 
david milenthal a spokesman for columbus together inc the 
organiztion that managed the exhibit in columbus said other cities 
looking to build tourism and economic development by subsidizing 
the arts should not be disuaded by the son of heaven losses 
if it hadnt been for the renovation of the high school at a 
cost 23 million for the exhibit this thing would have made 
money he said 
but other things we got from this cant be measured weve got 
a beautiful high school thats ready for the next show we had 
people come here from all 50 states and 50 countries people who 
wouldnt normally come here there were hundreds of articles 
written all over the world about the exhibit and columbus and ohio 
all of them positive you cant buy that kind of advertising 
nonetheless milenthal who is president of an advertising 
agency said that because of the controversy from the exhibit 
which was managed by his wife bonnie he will think twice the next 
time such an event is proposed 
i enjoyed every minute of the exhibit and working with it but 
when youve been slammed as badly as some of us involved have been 
slammed in the pasty few weeks i just dont know if id do it 
again he said

crammed into john flansburghs basement 
apartment in brooklyn are film reels old framed portraits brand 
new polaroids used rugs a box of punk 45s and a pharmaceutical 
typewriter 
a small statue of chiang kaishek is perched on the 
refrigerator on the stove rests a large scratched espresso pot 
the answering machine that activates the dialasong telephone 
message for his rock group they might be giants lies on the 
kitchen floor next to a shiny silver trash can 
no gold records hang from the walls but a used copy of the 
groups first lp can be found slouched atop an old cabinet in the 
crowded living roomstudio thats squeezed between the kitchen and 
bedroom 
flansburghs lived there for years near fellow giant john 
linnell they first moved in when the twoman band was just getting 
started playing to crowds that could fit comfortably into these 
tiny rooms 
but flansburgh 29 and linnell 30 are no longer college age 
and they might be giants is no longer just a college band sales 
for their second album lincoln neared 100000 and they 
should do even better with their new record flood 
the group is now signed with a major label elektra records 
which flansburgh recalled in a recent interview at his apartment 
rejected they might be giants three years ago because they had no 
melodies 
some of the songs are incredibly old and some of them were 
incredibly new and some were medium its your classic third album 
syndrome flansburgh said with a laugh 
theres this sort of obsessive of melodic thing linnell 
said we try and come up with a set of words that would be 
interesting to use with that melody 
i think were really into our kind of music theres a small 
range of stuff that we feel were actually good at i definitely 
wouldnt say were making a point 
so dont look for duets with labelmate anita baker or jam 
sessions with elektras heavy metal stars metallica and motley 
crue flood is more of the same or the different catchy 
melodies quirky arrangements and lyrics both sublime 
letterbox and ridiculous hearing aid 
there is one change four of the songs are produced by clive 
langer and alan winstanly elvis costello madness the result of 
what linnell reluctantly calls a compromise 
we wanted to produce it ourselves linnell said and we 
had never produced a record before by ourselves elektra said ok 
produce the record but for the single we want to get somebody to 
do it with you we went through a lots of producers and those were 
the guys we liked best 
flansburgh and linnell both grew up in the suburbs of boston but 
didnt write songs together until 1981 when they happened to move 
into the same building in downtown brooklyn 
commercials nearly preceded commercial success the two johns 
as friends call them were on their first tour at that tender 
rock moment after quitting their day jobs when they learned 
crazy eddies wanted to make use of their song im insane 
youre in a van and youre making 75 a night and you need 
80 a day to stay alive flansburgh recalled our manager said 
what difference does it make take the money itll be fun 
we definitely wanted the money we really had basic needs to 
fulfill that was very difficult to actually to go like no to 
but then we said no and they did this song that was based on it 
they pulled it right away 
sponsors stayed away and so did radio but thanks to heavy 
exposure on mtv whitney houston us whitesnake us was how 
flansburgh described it and a live act that featured prerecorded 
backing tracks and a most memorable stick they might be giants 
built an audience two minutes at a time 
when we first started out all our songs were fairly short 
had a verse a chorus kind of thing happening and there was always 
a middle section to break it up linnell recalled the middle 
section was always the free range part of the song i think 90 
percent of all our songs still follow that format 
with enough money in the bank flansburgh and linnell calmly 
turned down the hamburger chain that recently approached them they 
can even afford to look back reflecting on success that thankfully 
didnt occur overnight 
we get letters that say im starting a band and you guys 
make me feel like you can start a band its been a bumpy ride but 
the cart has kept moving flansburgh said 
weve been going for seven years doing this thing and every 
month has been a little better than the previous month by some 
small increment linnell said we never had the frightening 
wake up and suddenly your lifestyle is totally different 
experience

socialism has come full circle in 70 years a 
human life span so a personal memoir may be just the right medium 
for recounting its history 
heberto padilla cubas leading dissident intellectual has 
produced such a recollection in selfportrait of the other a 
book he calls a moral evaulation of myself it is also an 
evaluation of socialism 
in it padilla recalls his involvement with the cuban 
revolution how his enthusiasm soured and how the revolution 
punished him when he began to complain 
along the way he describes with a condensed and powerful style 
some memorable encounters with figures of the day jeanpaul 
sartre and albert camus che guevara and fidel castro and 
provides warm and respectful epitaphs for friends whom the 
revolution mistrusted among them the poet jose lezama lima and 
the playwright virgilio pineira 
padillas complaints led in 1971 to his imprisonment beatings 
and a public selfcriticism session the padilla case was a 
key juncture in the cuban revolution and an axiomatic event in the 
history of communism 
just as stalins show trials stripped many western intellectuals 
of their faith in soviet communism in the 1930s padillas 
treatment disabused liberal followers of castro of the notion that 
his tropical communism was blessed with a special saving grace 
a legion of prominent leftleaning writers among them sartre 
alberto moravia and susan sontag signed a protest letter to 
castro 
more importantly the episode drove a wedge into the virtually 
unanimous support that castro had enjoyed among latin 
intellectuals among the defectors was author mario vargas llosa 
who since has drifted steadily to the right today he is a 
conservative partys candidate for president of peru 
padillas generation was raised to view revolution as 
inevitable and to pursue it with ecclesiastic zeal as if leninism 
were the holy grail most of the influential hispanic writers 
described in selfportrait of the other had at least a brief 
courtship with a communist party 
now that a more pantheistic array of ideas has sprung from the 
shrouds of leninism the new generation of latin american poets 
are freer than we who believed that communism was the only hope 
for humanity padilla said in an interview from princeton nj 
where he has made his home since 1980 
we had all those old communist poets from the 1930s nicolas 
guillen the chilean pablo neruda spaniard rafael alberti 
riding on our backs but those people arent very influential 
anymore 
from the beginning padilla spurned the lush baroque imagery 
associated with neruda for a more lean poetics such as those of 
robert lowell and stjohn perse 
ideologically however he was keen on revolution after 
castros triumph he helped edit the literary supplement lunes de 
revolucion then went abroad working as a correspondent for the 
official cuban news agency and as a commercial diplomat 
a prolonged stay in moscow quashed his hopes for socialism and 
sharpened his sense of the pathetic both in himself and others 
in selfportrait he describes being ignored by castro 
during the latters visit to moscow we should have realized 
right then and there the kind of objects we were small animals of 
history which someone superior knew how to make use of and then 
discard 
yet he manages a kind of sympathy for anibal escalante a 
hardline communist who had lost out in a cuban power struggle and 
was consigned to a posting in the soviet union when snow covered 
moscow he seemed to cringe inside his black overcoat like a 
turtle in his shell fidel castro had decreed his extinction 
and he was never able to bring himself back to life 
padilla returned in the mid1960s to havana and his book of 
troubled verse out of the game won a national prize in 1968 
however the authorities found fault in padillas sarcasm and 
bitterness 
in the grim state security proceedings that followed his arrest 
in 1971 padillas aesthetic judgments were put on trial the cuban 
government was announcing that it no longer tolerated the personal 
criteria of its artists and wanted them to glorify the 
selfsacrifice required by the fatherland 
padilla never spells out whether he regrets having made the 
confession in which he also indicted more than 20 friends the 
reader is left to infer that he faced death or long imprisonment 
had he refused to do so 
under constant police surveillance padilla worked as a 
translator like the soviet writer boris pasternak in an earlier 
time until castro permitted him to emigrate in 1980 
padilla hopes some day to return home and with walls falling 
around the world he predicts that the one isolating cuba also will 
tumble 
it will be sudden like with ceausescu he said referring 
to romanias deposed leader i think it is inevitable

what johnny carson is to nbc ralph 
emery is to cable 
for the past seven years emery has been host of nashville 
now on the nashville network the live 90minute show reaches 48 
million households 
like carson emery sits behind a desk interviewing guests 
but theres more music on emerys show and much of it is country 
entertainment virtually every country music star has performed on 
the program which is broadcast from opryland usa theme park 
91030 pm est monday through friday 
emery has never met carson but respects him as a professional 
and consistently good entertainer 
i like him a lot emery said in an interview in his office 
suite a few miles from the cable network studio hes always been 
one of my heroes 
hes totally in command of every situation and ive seen 
people try to trap him and nobody can do it 
he has built that all important element credibility and 
consistency carson can always be counted on to be entertaining i 
cant say that about every entertainer having guest stars on is 
great but youve got to be pretty good yourself every night he 
said 
like the tonight show starring johnny carson emery has a 
live band standup comedians and some audience participation 
cards from the studio members he even occasionally does a 
monologue 
we do a little talk and a lot of music and thats the big 
difference emery said our show has at least seven songs a 
night and sometimes eight and with interview segments under three 
to four minutes each 
emery also admires the exuberance of another talk show host 
arsenio hall of the fox network 
hes very good he has a very animated face a great smile 
great eyes and lots of energy and obviously good writers emery 
said

reflecting sagging interest in cash rebates and lowinterest 
financing that were the rage in january and february 1989

hes known as the father of financial futures 
but after 23 years as a leader of the chicago mercantile exchange 
leo melamed says hes stepping down to spend more time with his 
real family 
theyve always taken short change in my obligations and 
responsibilities and they always get left behind melamed said 
of his wife bette and three grown children 
the 57yearold chairman of the mercs executive committee made 
the surprise announcement monday telling a news conference he 
wanted to smell the flowers along the way while i can still smell 
something 
his resignation becomes effective at the end of the year the 
merc board has not yet named his successor 
the polishborn melamed a tireless innovator and cheerleader 
for the futures industry said he was not retiring for health 
reasons or because of the continuing federal investigation of 
trading fraud at the merc and the larger chicago board of trade 
the worlds two biggest futures markets 
he said he planned to continue trading to devote more time to 
his trading firm dellsher investment company inc and to do more 
writing melamed published a sciencefiction novel the tenth 
planet in 1987 and said he has finished a sequel 
melamed also said he expects the merc to launch its globex 
electronic trading system one of his pet projects by june 30 
implementation of globex originally slated for the spring of 
1989 has been delayed in part because of trouble in getting 
approval from the japanese government for japanese companies to 
trade on the system 
its going to create a real vacuum john damgard president 
of the futures industry association a washingtonbased trade 
group said of melameds pending departure 
under the leadership of the charismatic and outspoken melamed 
the chicago merc pioneered trading of financial futures that allow 
investors to hedge bets on the future prices of currencies and 
stock indexes 
before melamed futures exchanges were best known for trading 
agricultural commodities eggs livestock and pork bellies in the 
mercs case futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and 
financial instruments in the future at prices agreed upon when the 
contract is bought 
with the help of milton friedman a nobel laureate in economics 
the merc introduced the first foreign currency futures in 1972 
they gave investors the chance to bet on future values of the west 
german mark the swiss franc the canadian dollar and the japanese 
yen 
the contracts fueled explosive growth in the industry and 
brought futures greater respectability in the financial world 
financial products such as currency bond and stockindex 
futures accounted for more than 60 percent of the 2674 million 
futures contracts traded last year in the united states in 1970 
us futures trading volume totaled 136 million contracts 
the growth also brought controversy though many investors 
blamed computerized trading strategies that use stockindex futures 
for accelerating the plunge of the stock market during the october 
1987 crash 
melamed was one of the staunchest defenders of stockindex 
futures and his lobbying helped fend off congressional efforts to 
impose curbs on the market 
melamed was chairman of the merc from 1969 until 1971 when he 
stepped aside to become chairman of a new affiliate set up to trade 
financial futures the international monetary market 
in 1976 the imm merged with the merc and melamed became 
chairman of the combined institutions 
a year later the merc board created the office of special 
counsel to the board and named melamed to the position and to the 
position of chairman of the executive committee 
melamed began working as a runner at the merc in the early 1950s 
while working his way through law school he became an exchange 
member in 1954 and a member of the exchanges board of governors in 
1967

american express cos decision to acquire all 
the common stock of its shearson lehman hutton inc subsidiary 
gives it room to make broad cuts at the nations secondlargest 
securities firm in private analysts said 
the shakeout continued monday as shearson said it is closing up 
to 50 retail brokerage offices nationwide by april 1 sources said 
the firm also is trying to sell an ailing real estate subsidiary 
wall street observers wondered why american express would go to 
the trouble of buying the remaining publicly held shares of 
shearson when it already had pumped 1 billion into the brokerage 
and owned about threequarters of its shares 
the only thing they really said was it gives them greater 
flexibility in solving shearsons problems though if you already 
own 75 percent how much flexibility do you need said lawrence 
eckenfelder an industry analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc 
the decision amounted to a complete reversal for american 
express which as recently as last month had planned to decrease 
its stake in shearson from 61 percent to under 50 percent to remove 
the brokerage from its balance sheet 
american express has seized total control in an attempt to turn 
around a firm that expanded wildly in the 1980s but has suffered 
because of overcapacity and excessive spending during an industry 
recession 
it ousted former chairman peter a cohen in late january and 
replaced him with an american express executive howard l clark 
jr agreed in the past three months to pump 1 billion into the 
firm to shore up the its credit rating and finally decided to take 
over shearson entirely 
analysts said the latest move which involves exchanging 350 
million worth of american express shares for the 28 million 
publicly held shearson shares does not eliminate the possibility 
that the travel card company might sell all or part of shearson 
but it ended for now talks on merging shearson with smith barney 
harris upham amp co the brokerage owned by primerica corp 
were doing it to make crystal clear our very strong 
commitment to shearson for the long term and to enable us to work 
with shearson in using the capital were providing most effectively 
and efficiently an american express spokesman said 
the spokesman who asked not to be named said ownership of all 
common stock was the most prudent course of action in the current 
environment but declined to elaborate 
while american express will own all of shearsons common nippon 
life insurance co will retain preferred stock that gives it a 13 
percent voting stake in the brokerage 
taking shearson private at about 1250 a share compared to 
34 a share at the brokerages first public stock offering in 1987 
will reduce public scrutiny of the firms finances american 
express also said it will gain some tax benefits 
shearson insiders said the firm would be able to cut departments 
and negotiate with potential buyers more freely than if the firm 
were publicly held 
it may be more geared toward when they want to get rid of this 
thing eckenfelder said even if the business starts to 
recover i still think the idea long term is to sell 
if shearson does not rebound quickly in an industry still 
hurting from the october 1987 stock market crash american express 
will have to absorb all of the firms losses but if shearson 
rebounds american express will have gotten a good deal in the 
cheap stock analysts said 
shearson is engaged in a broad review of its businesses the 
firm last week said it was laying off 2000 of its 35500 workers 
by the end of the month 
sources at shearson said the firm was cutting back much of its 
real estate activities including making attempts to sell its 
balcor subsidiary which had 145 loans worth about 11 billion 
outstanding last nov 30 
according to federal filings balcor had 114 million in 
nonperforming assets including loans and about 22 million in 
directly owned real estate the subsidiary has just 10 million in 
reserves to cover its portfolio of loans to realestate 
partnerships and client companies 
a shearson spokesman steven faigen declined to comment on 
whether shearson was seeking a buyer for balcor 
shearson also said 45 to 50 retail brokerage offices would be 
closed or consolidated with other offices it said there would be 
no disruption to client accounts 
shearson is the nations second largest retail brokerage with 
about 10000 brokers at 600 branches nationwide

despite a 79 percent drop in latefebruary sales 
of north americanmade cars and light trucks the industry may be 
stronger than some have forecast automakers and analysts say 
in fact sales during the first two months of 1990 a year 
forecast to be weaker than last year are running just about even 
with the 1989 pace automakers reported monday 
all our business is doing great said frank bartolo general 
sales manager of celozziettleson chevroletgeo in chicago its 
just what i expected i think it will be strong from here into 
october 
the nine companies making cars and trucks in the united states 
reported monday they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate 
of 42688 in feb 2128 compared with 46336 in the same time last 
year 
car sales fell 67 percent during the period and truck sales 
were down 10 percent 
automakers and some analysts have predicted sales this year 
would be weaker than the 148 million cars and trucks that left 
dealer lots last year but that may be changing 
looking at the first two months of the new year sales are not 
only much improved from the fourth quarter but somewhat ahead of 
the pace we anticipated when establishing our industry forecast for 
145 million units in 1990 said robert rewey ford motor cos 
vice president for north american sales operations 
auto analyst jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san 
francisco said she expects the 1990 sales pace to be roughly the 
same as last years and mondays figures while for only two 
months back that prediction 
i guess its good news in the sense that there were some 
people who were concerned that the trend for 1990 was established 
by the sales rate of late 1989 she said the market in the 
last quarter of 1989 was very weak 
the overall market in 1990 is going to be stronger than that 
i think auto sales are going to rebound at about the trend that was 
established last year 
domestic and imported car and truck sales for january and 
february seem to indicate that automakers said sales during the 
first two months of this year were down 08 percent from last year 
with a 06 percent increase in domestic vehicle sales offset by a 
54 percent decline in imports 
normally march and april are good car and truck sales months as 
americans shake off the winter and get ready for spring and 
summertime road trips that pattern was disrupted last year when 
attractive incentives in january and february turned potential 
springtime buyers into actual latewinter purchasers 
fred voelkel sales manager of brown and brown chevroletgeo in 
mesa ariz said he expects his newcar inventory to swell from 
its current 75day level to about 90 days in anticipation of a 
springtime buying blitz 
but garretty said she wasnt so sure that would happen 
i throw up my hands as to what the carbuying cycle is 
anymore she said incentives have changed things so much it is 
really hard to go pick a time for increased sales

an arbitration panel has ordered shearson 
lehman hutton to pay damages totaling more than 1 million to three 
oklahomans who claimed their broker made unuathorized trades and 
churned their accounts 
an arbitration panel of the national association of securities 
dealers ordered shearson to pay 994766 in compensatory and 
punitive damages and lawyers fees to temple okla farmer walter 
earl cox and his wife ardenia f cox 
in a decision late last month disclosed monday the panel also 
awarded separately a total of 60694 in damages and fees to mrs 
cox and her mother cuba e read of comanche okla 
the toltal compensatory damages of 213864 were trebled by 
claims made by the coxes under the civil provisions of the federal 
racketeering laws 
both awards came in response to claims made against onetime 
shearson registered representative lindy kent ridinger of wichita 
falls texas 
the coxes lawyer frank lewis of phoenix ariz said the 
decision was the first he knew of where both punitive and treble 
damages were awarded as well as attorneys fees 
the nasd which oversees the overthecounter stock market also 
supplies the majority of arbitrators for brokerageclient disputes 
more than 3600 case last year compared to 1100 handled by the 
new york stock exchanges and about 100 by other groups 
the three customers alleged in a complaint first filed in august 
1988 that ridinger and shearson engaged in unauthorized trading 
of their accounts that their trading accounts were churned and 
that the trades placed in their accounts were highly speculative in 
nature 
shearson denied the accusations and ridinger who was fired june 
2 1986 never responded to the charges according to documents of 
the nasd 
churning which is illegal under securities and exchange 
commission rules is unnecessary trading in a clients account 
which increases the brokers commission 
ridinger was formally censured by the nasd barred from 
associating with its members in any capacity and fined 50000 
he was not reachable for comment 
while we dont agree with the decision in this particular 
instance it has done nothing to shake our confidance in the 
arbitration process which we feel is an equitable and efficient 
manner to resolve disputes of this nature said steve faigen a 
shearson spokesman in new york 
many brokerage houses like shearson require customers upon 
opening accounts to sign agreements that they will take disputes 
with the house to arbitration rather than court 
last year the us supreme court in cases involving shearson 
upheld the legality of compelling customers to sign arbitration 
agreements as the price of doing business 
several members of congress have criticized the practice as 
unfairly restrictive 
whats important about this award said deborah masucci 
director of arbitration for the nasd is that it shows 
arbitrators are willing to make such awards where the conditions 
are egregious

hotels dealt with making their own beds and doing without prompt 
room service during the biggest hotel strike in hawaii history up 
to 7500 workers are on strike for better pay and benefits 
we have to make a living said caoili who makes about 850 
an hour if we dont do something there will be a time when 
these people cannot afford to live here 
nearby joe and jill cody of atlanta said that although they are 
enjoying their stay this has not been the hawaiian honeymoon they 
were expecting 
the biggest problem is having to make our own bed jill cody 
said they say theyre going to try to clean the rooms every 
other day 
not all was bad though the hotel gave them a 20 percent 
discount despite having to walk past lines of chanting strikers 
they said they are enjoying the palm trees and beaches that make 
hawaii a dream vacation destination for millions of tourists each 
year 
the walkout began saturday after negotiators for local 5 of the 
hotel and restaurant employees union rejected a management offer 
talks were to resume today at the behest of gov john waihee said 
federal mediator frank shoeppel 
the strike affects about onefourth of the 37000 hotel rooms in 
waikiki the states prime tourist destination and oneseventh of 
the 70000 hotel rooms in the state according to the hawaii 
visitors bureau 
the hotels were using nonunion staff and temporary hires to 
maintain limited operations 
jeanne park director of public relations for hilton hotels in 
hawaii said she has helped clear tables clean ashtrays and 
dispatch housekeeping services since the strike began 
nobody wins in this situation park said when i see my 
buddies out there on the picket lines i feel bad for them and i 
feel bad for us 
the union turned down a fouryear contract that includes what 
management calculates as a wageandbenefit package of 7 percent 
annually but which the union said is more like 4 percent a year 
hotel workers who do not receive tips average 922 an hour 
tipped workers earn an average of 487 an hour 
we cant afford to go on the way things are now said 
roberta bennett a restaurant hostess at the sheraton waikiki who 
makes 820 an hour 
bennett said she her husband and their baby live in a studio 
apartment for 600 a month with her hotel job a second job making 
tshirts and her husbands job with a tugboat company she said 
they barely meet expenses 
some tourists were unsympathetic to the strikers others tried 
to pay them no mind 
its almost contradictory theyre yelling scabs go home 
but its those scabs who are doing the jobs that bring the money 
here said bill carlile of alexandria va a guest at the ilikai 
hotel 
on a scale of 10 right now id give my vacation a seven 
said terry klein of victoria canada they really dont bug me 
and if theyve got a just cause go for it 
economists say the strike could badly damage hawaiis economy if 
it is long and if news reports give the impression the states 
tourist industry is paralyzed 
hotel officials stressed that all hotels are operating 
anyone planning a hawaii vacation can be assured of receiving 
the usual hawaiian hospitality said william crawford executive 
director of the council of hawaii hotels

the california medical association has 
rejected a ban on aerial spraying of the medfly pesticide malathion 
to date there is no documented evidence malathion is 
injurious to public health said dr richard karlan a beverly 
hills surgeon at the cmas annual conference at which the measure 
lost in a voice vote monday of 450 delegates 
were using common sense here well be the first to respond 
if we think there is a danger 
the state is spraying the pesticide to protect californias 14 
billion farm industry from the cropdestroying pest 
residents of many southern california communities receiving 
almost weekly dousings of the pesticide have staged emotional 
protests some communities have gone to court and pasadena banned 
lowlevel helicopter flights at night 
dr h rex greene of pasadena who introduced the measure 
disagreed with karlan and others that voting down the ban served as 
an endorsement of malathion i think cma really doesnt want to 
take a position he said 
meanwhile a federal aviation administration official warned 
communities against banning helicopter spraying of malathion faa 
regional administrator jerry chavkin said congress gave his agency 
sole authority to regulate the skies 
actions which interfere with the flight of any aircraft 
including helicopters engaged in efforts to eradicate the medfly 
represent a serious threat to aviation safety he said

japans sharp corp has developed a desktop 
facsimile machine that can transmit photographlike fullcolor 
images the company announced tuesday 
the company said the fax machine is the first made for general 
office use that can transmit fullcolor pictures although some 
newspapers use very expensive fax equipment to send page layouts 
from one printing plant to another 
the machine can send a photograph the size of a standard sheet 
of typewriter paper over a regular telephone line in three minutes 
and can reproduce subtle color shades tsutomu muroi a company 
official said 
the transmission time can be cut to about 20 seconds if the fax 
is sent over digital communications lines which are used by some 
companies for telephone calls and data communications he said 
for each page the cost for paper and a multicolor ribbon is 
about 300 yen o about 2 at current exchange rates the company 
said 
in a public test between two japanese cities tuesday the 
transmitted copy of a photograph closely matched the original 
except the colors were slightly darker muroi said 
the machine also can send and receive regular black and white 
faxes he said 
the machine will go on sale in japan in the fall for about 35 
million yen 23000 and overseas sales are expected next year 
muroi said 
but that price is likely to drop quickly in the future the 
same way that prices for regular fax machines fell rapidly he 
said 
previously manufacturers were unable to develop fax equipment 
that could send color images in a moderate amount of time because 
of the large amounts of color data involved 
the new machine uses an advanced color scanner developed by 
sharp and digital imageprocessing technology to compress the image 
information muroi said 
sharp also developed a way to cut transmission time by checking 
only a sample of about onetenth of the information sent rather 
than the entire transmission he said 
an international standard does not exist for color facsimile 
transmissions and compatibility problems could occur if other 
manufacturers introduce different systems in the future 
but muroi said sharp is working on a worldwide standard for 
color faxes similiar to current ones for black and white facsimiles

in a marketing marriage sure to make film purists 
wince a japanese company is putting scarlett ohara and rhett 
butler on a bottle of wine 
its not the first time the characters from gone with the 
wind have appeared outside of the printed page or silver screen 
and most us fans of the old south epic probably will never see a 
bottle of gone with the wind wine 
the new line of wines is to be sold only in japan under a 
license granted by the owners of the movie atlantabased turner 
broadcasting system inc to the japanese media conglomerate 
fujisankei communications international inc 
still some people in the land of cotton wish this wine would 
soon be forgotten 
dont you think it cheapens the book and the movie asked 
hal clarke the lawyer for gone with the wind author margaret 
mitchells estate 
for fujisankei officials the wine represents a chance to cash 
in on japans love of american popular culture and the nations 
everincreasing affection for wine 
katherine melchior ray senior account manager with fujisankei 
said the gone with the wind tiein was a natural 
were always looking for highquality unusual american 
products to sell in japan she said monday we see a demand in 
japan for more beers and wine with the interest in fine wines and 
beer and interest in all american media we figured why not put the 
two together 
the line of california wines was to be unveiled today at a 
reception at new yorks 21 club the wine label features the 
familiar gone with the wind movie poster with stars clark 
gable and vivien leigh embracing against a backdrop of atlanta 
burning 
ms ray said tbs officials initially were reluctant to slap 
gone with the wind labels on wine bottles tbs agreed she 
said because we took a lot of care to show this was going to 
maintain the prestige of the movie and encourage the beauty of the 
scenes in gone with the wind 
tbs receives several calls a month from people wanting to 
use gone with the wind in some way said lois sloane tbs vice 
president for licensing and merchandising 
the requests are screened carefully and only those that properly 
honor the film are granted licensing agreements ms sloane said 
monday from her new york office 
we care very much about gone with the wind ms sloane 
said 
most of the products approved for licensing are geared to 
adults she said things such as commemorative plates stationery 
and figurines items such as toys and hard liquor have been 
rejected she said 
tbs chairman ted turners fondness for gone with the wind is 
well known it is shown daily at the movie theater at turners cnn 
center in downtown atlanta 
terms of the deal with fujisankei were not disclosed 
attorney clarke said the appearance of gone with the wind 
wine was unexpected this came as quite a surprise to us he 
said 
clarke said he intended to examine the agreement to make sure 
its on firm ground but doubted he had any legal grounds to 
oppose it he said the estate has not objected to marketing schemes 
when they promote the sale of the movie or the book 
the wine will go on sale in japan may 1 and will cost between 
11 and 17 a bottle compared to about 8 a bottle for most 
california wines sold there currently most wine sold in japan is 
french 
about 10000 cases of gone with the wind to be distributed 
by sanraku are being shipped initially 
atlanta historian franklin garrett who knew miss mitchell as a 
young writer expressed amusement at the idea of a gone with the 
wind wine 
i dont know gone with the wind wine sounds pretty good 
though it probably hasnt got the remotest connection to gone with 
the wind garrett said 
i guess its a compliment to the book he added but if 
you get to using it too much for things other than the book it 
might lose its distinctiveness

an environmental group is calling for an 
excise tax to pay for repainting up to 2 million homes and 
apartments and rid them of old leadbased paint that it says poses 
a health risk to millions of children 
in a report monday the environmental defense fund said more 
than 3 million preschool children suffer from lead poisoning from 
paint in their homes although such paint has not been sold for 
more than a dozen years 
the group said toxic levels of paint are found in many 
youngsters under age 6 because an estimated 2 million apartments 
and houses still have leadcontaining paint on the walls 
it has been estimated that the cost of ridding homes of lead 
paint could be 2000 to 10000 per house and the environmental 
group said congress should pass an excise tax on domestic and 
imported lead to help pay for the work 
we have built up an accumulation of lead from past uses that 
will not go away lead does not decay ellen silbergeld a 
senior toxicologist for the environmental group said at a news 
conference 
in an analysis based mainly on government statistics the 
organization said children in scores of cities have lead levels in 
their blood of more than 15 micrograms per deciliter of blood that 
is the level at which the environmental protection agency and other 
authorities believe childrn suffer some damage 
high levels of lead can cause serious brain damage but health 
experts say that even low levels of exposure can cause decreased 
intelligence shortterm memory loss and underachievement in school 
ms silbergeld said that while childrens exposure to lead from 
paint often was thought to come from eating paint chips it is 
widely believed now that paint dust normally released from paint 
as it ages poses the greatest threat to children 
the defense fund study said the greatest problem from lead paint 
is in older cities and is particularly acute among black children 
who often live in older housing in inner cities 
while nationally about 17 percent of preschool children are 
believed to have elevated lead levels in their blood almost 70 
percent of urban black children from poor families are estimated to 
exceed that level as are 35 percent of white children in similar 
circumstances the report said 
the group used national figures on exposure provided by the us 
public health service and separate statistics on the age of houses 
to produce an estimate as to what cities are likely to have the 
worst problem with children exposure to lead from paint 
this analysis showed 10 urban areas with roughly onefourth or 
more of the preschool children having elevated levels of lead that 
exceeded 15 micrograms per deciliter of blod 
the 10 areas and the percentage of children with those levels of 
lead were new york citynew jersey metropolitan area 338 
percent newark nj 30 percent jersey city nj 293 percent 
cleveland 274 percent new orleans 266 percent philadelphia 
264 percent chicago 255 percent baltimore 249 percent

japans mitsubishi industrial group and 
daimlerbenz ag west germanys largest industrial conglomerate 
are exploring the possibility of expanding their business ties 
mitsubishi officials said tuesday 
an announcement by mitsubishi said the areas explored in recent 
discussions included highgrowth industries such as aerospace 
electronics and the service sector that would benefit from 
development on a global scale and make effective use of the skills 
of both groups 
executives from subsidiaries of the two industrial groups held 
talks in singapore over the weekend 
there was a farreaching exchange of ideas about ways to 
expand the relationship beyond the automotive sector where mercedes 
benz and mitsubishi motors corp have enjoyed close ties it said 
the announcement said senior managers from mitsubishi and 
daimlerbenz expressed pleasure at having gained greater 
familiarity with each other and agreed to hold further meetings in 
due course

next meeting would be in 1991 
the big japanese and west german companies both make motor 
vehicles and electronics equipment and are active in the aviation 
and space fields 
mori pointed out that the four mitsubishi companies and the four 
daimlerbenz companies whose executives participated in the 
discussions were roughly comparable 
mitsubishi motors and mercedesbenz make motor vehicles 
mitsubishi electric and aeg make electrical systems and components 
mitsubishi heavy industries and deutsche aerospace make aircraft 
and aerospace equipment and mitsubishi corp and daimlerbenz 
inter services are in trading and investment services 
mori said the weekend meeting evolved from a meeting last

on the london and paris stock exchanges mori said 
morohashi and reuter led their companies executives at the

japans finance ministry tuesday approved the 
merger of mitsui bank ltd and taiyo kobe bank ltd paving the way 
for the establishment in april of the second largest bank in japan 
as measured by deposits 
masaaki tsuchida head of the ministrys banking bureau handed 
the letter of approval personally to mitsui bank president kenichi 
suematsu and taiyo kobe bank president yasuo matsushita 
the new bank to be called the mitsui taiyo kobe bank ltd will 
be the second largest following daiichi kangyo bank ltd when it 
opens for business on april 1 
since announcing the merger plan in late august last year the 
two banks have been thrashing out details 
suematsu and matsushita in a joint statement said the new 
bank capitalizing on its broad networks in japan and overseas 
will try to maximize the effectiveness of the merger for the 
benefit of its customers 
taiyo kobe maintains the greater number of local branches in 
japan totaling 363 at the time of the merger announcement last 
august while mitsui has 228 
the merger will help mitsui bank improve retail banking activity 
in the country taiyo kobe on the other hand can take advantage 
of mitsuis strong overseas network of 86 bases of operation

a human error has delayed tax refunds for 
53000 taxpayers who took advantage of the internal revenue 
services muchpublicized electronic filing system the irs said 
today 
electronic filers affected by the foulup who elected to have 
refunds deposited directly into their bank accounts should receive 
those refunds by march 12 rather than feb 26 said irs spokesman 
frank keith those choosing to take a paper check should have it in 
hand by march 16 rather than march 2 
obviously this is an inconvenience to taxpayers and we regret 
that keith said he noted however that before this glitch the 
irs had been processing returns at a record pace and certifying 
refunds from paper returns in about five weeks 
the foulup affected only a portion of electronic returns filed 
into the irs service center in cincinnati from the southeast and 
central states plus 250000 other records including some paper 
returns filed from the central states keith said he said the 
error occurred at the irss martinsburg wva facility to which 
computer tapes containing taxreturn files are shipped by the 10 
regional processing centers once a week 
keith said the problem was caused by an employee who delayed 
running one days work at the cincinnati center through the 
martinsburg computer 
more than 25 million couples and individuals have filed their 
returns electronically this year in response to an irs campaign 
promising refunds within as little as two weeks nationwide 
electronic filing is available this year for the first time 
although it still can be used only by taxpayers who are due a 
refund 
under this process a taxpayer completes his or her own return 
or hires a professional to do it and it then is transmitted via 
telephone directly into an irs computer this dramatically reduces 
the number of errors and saves the irs time and money by 
eliminating clerical work 
the foulup involving 53000 electronic returns points up once 
again the fact that our computer system is antiquated keith said 
under an eightyear 8 billion plan now being implemented the 
agencys 1960s technology will be replaced by a computer system 
that will allow irs computers across the country to communicate 
directly with each other that will mean the agency will no longer 
have to ship computer tapes by truck from regional offices to the 
west virginia center

in an effort to increase its output and meet 
rapid growth in electricity demand the virginia power co has 
received federal permission to buy electric power from a 400 
million plant that a subsidiary of japans mitsubishi corp plans 
to build in central virginia 
the deal was approved last week by the federal energy regulatory 
commission according to todays editions of the washington post 
several industry experts call the deal the first of its kind in 
this country a fullsize conventional power plant built and 
operated by an independent company that is in the business of 
manufacturing electricity for the wholesale market 
the plant will burn natural gas supplied by a new 120mile 65 
million pipeline that will link gas lines in loudoun county and the 
tidewater virginia area 
traditionally utility companies have built their own plants in 
addition for the past decade federal law has required power 
companies to purchase power generated by small independent 
producers burning renewable fuels but the mitsubishi project was 
negotiated outside the scope of that law the newspaper reported 
while the mitsubishi plant falls outside the normal channels of 
stateregulated utilities the rate it proposes charging for the 
power does not virginia power and mitsubishi have agreed on a rate 
equivalent to what it would cost virginia power to produce the 
electricity in a plant it had built 
officials said the deal should not effect the bills of virginia 
power retail customers 
mitsubishi has agreed to bear the cost if it is forced to pay 
more to produce the power than its sales contract allows it to 
recapture from virginia power the company is willing to take the 
risk because it gains entry to a new area of business

the soviet parliament today overwhelmingly 
approved legislation that will allow people to own factories and 
hire workers for the first time in nearly 70 years 
in the early 1920s soviet founder vladimir i lenin and his 
bolsheviks retreated from their drive to implement communism and 
allowed private ownership of the means of production under the new 
economic policy or nep 
todays vote by the supreme soviet was hailed by supporters as a 
great step forward it is one of the key elements of president 
mikhail s gorbachevs economic reform package 
this is an enormous step forward because it lays down the 
principle of pluralism in the forms of ownership and the basis of 
their equality and their protection from the government said 
deputy alexei yablokov 
after a sectionbysection vote on each of the bills six parts 
the legislation was given final approval by a margin of 3503 
eleven deputies abstained 
the joint meeting of the supreme soviets two houses broke into 
applause as the total was announced 
the section on the property rights of soviet citizens which 
includes the right to own factories and other means of producing 
goods passed 3540 with 13 abstensions 
a western diplomat watching the session said it would be the 
first time since the new economic policy that private individuals 
would be allowed to own industrial plant 
people have traditionally been allowed to own cars summer 
homes and other personal property 
the law also gives individuals the right to hire others to work 
for them as long as their pay and benefits are in keeping with 
soviet law both the private ownership of factories and hired labor 
are regarded in classic marxism as exploitation of workers and 
were one of the key targets of lenins revolution 
despite its strong stand on property rights the bill continued 
to skirt the socialist bugaboo of private property it makes no 
mention of private property but refers instead to the property of 
citizens 
its unfortunate that there is no mention of private property 
but the principle is there yablokov said 
noted political commentator fyodor burlatsky also a deputy 
said the bill was a good start but still inadequate to pull the 
soviet union from its economic quagmire 
vice president anatoly i lukyanov who chaired the joint 
meeting of the supreme soviets two chambers urged the legislature 
not to drag its feet on the bill which is to become law on july 1 
we need this law to go into effect fast he said

associated press writerequals 
somers conn ap most are doing hard time for crimes such as 
manslaughter and rape but for some inmates at somers state prison 
hard time means working with software 
eight to 10 hours a day seven days a week inmates in the 
prisons computer class can be found hunched in front of terminals 
writing sophisticated programs that have saved the state thousands 
of dollars and piles of paperwork 
they have automated virtually everything that can be automated 
at the prison from school attendance records to pay schedules for 
the 1400 inmates 
their conversations are laced with terms like dbase xt 
and pc they read all the computer literature they can get 
their hands on write articles of their own about the field and 
share their expertise with other inmates 
in prison its important to fill your day and if you can fill 
it with something productive its all the better says peter 
schickler 45 the only one of the 16 inmates in the program with 
extensive computer experience id say 80 percent of the people 
that come through will get a computer job which when you think 
about it is a whole different world from what most people in 
prison are able to do 
youll find with a programmer hes judged by how good a 
programmer he is and not by his personal background adds 
schickler who is serving 20 years for manslaughter 
the computer school at somers was started in 1982 but under the 
tutelage of department of correction teacher carl gabbert it has 
grown from a few small unsophisticated computers to 15 
ibmcompatible personal computers all with the latest software 
theres a waiting list to get in 
nobody turns their life around until theyve made a decision 
to says william e flower a department of correction spokesman 
but once theyve made a decision to turn their life around then 
they need a vehicle thats what this program provides 
a mainframe consultant before his 1984 conviction schickler 
could be in the top onehundredth of 1 percent of the computer 
field in the united states says carey prague assistant director 
of corporate finance at travelers cos and a volunteer adviser to 
the program 
for 25yearold douglas lavigne computers have meant a focus 
an eventual career and a source of pride that he never had when he 
was free 
at 17 lavigne was sentenced to 20 years for manslaughter in a 
drugrelated shooting and stabbing when he was still a high school 
senior while his classmates went off to college lavigne went to 
prison 
the parole board recently reduced lavignes sentence to 18 
years which means a possible release within a few years lavigne 
is hoping for college and a computer career 
im young enough i got a second chance and i took advantage 
of it the softspoken lavigne said as he demonstrated a 
classdevised program that tracks health records at another prison 
i got more hours on a computer than anybody else my age 
thats for sure i can compete i just got to get the old formal 
education and then im all set 
william toby wright who had a 10thgrade education and 
worked for a dry cleaner and carpenter before he was convicted of 
manslaughter eight years ago landed an interview as a progammer at 
aetna life amp casualty when he became eligible for parole recently 
parole was denied so it never went any further but prague said 
wright and the others will have no problem finding lucrative jobs 
in fact prague the author of 23 books on computers and a 
consultant for ashtontate co says some of the inmates 
schickler and lavigne in particular are so good they could easily 
make annual salaries that top 100000 
prague thought he would volunteer as a teacher but i found 
they knew more than i did now he advises them on their futures 
most of the schoolwork has gone to computerize various aspects 
of the prison but gabberts class has also done work for the 
outside the class recently signed on as a test site for 
ashtontate testing the software giants newest products it is 
ideally suited because the work is rigorous and timeconsuming 
when correction officials decided in 1988 that the prisons 
pharmacy system was obsolete they turned to the computer class 
computer vendors had told the department that the equipment to 
make the pharmacy efficient would cost up to 60000 or more the 
inmates were able to do it for 13500 and they trained the staff 
to use the lowcost system without outside help the computer 
processes 300 prescriptions a day produces labels tracks medical 
histories and maintains an inventory of 1200 drugs serving two 
other institutions 
all is not trust the class instructor watches out for mischief 
as well 
for the computer whizzes at somers money is clearly not the 
draw the most they can make in prison is 140 a day 
the word i keep going back to is self esteem schickler 
says the whole reason that were in here is to pay a debt you 
might say i kind of feel good when one of the guys someone who 
has never touched a computer before gets a job or a letter of 
commendation knowing that i was a part of it gives me a lot of 
satisfaction 
for lavigne computers may be the way he can restore the faith 
he believes his family lost in him eight years ago 
i put them through hell and back again and i have to try to 
do some making up there he says they stuck by me through this 
whole thing so hopefully theyll be proud of me some day

pacificorp said it will continue its courtship of 
pinnacle west capital corp despite the arizona companys rejection 
of a sweetened 17 billion takeover offer 
pinnacle west announced monday that its board had rejected the 
offer by pacificorp saying it was subject to a number of 
conditions which sharply reduced its value 
pacificorps offer to exchange 088 of its new common shares for 
each of pinnacle wests 867 million outstanding shares of common 
superseded two previous offers including one in december for 8 a 
share or a total of 6939 million 
pacificorps shares fell 37 cents on the new york stock 
exchange monday to 2212 at that price its offer valued 
pinnacle west at 1947 a share or 17 billion pinnacle west 
stock fell 25 cents monday to 1175 
the board unanimously determined that pacificorps proposal is 
inadequate and not in the best interest of pinnacle west and its 
shareholders said pinnacle west chairman richard snell 
pacificorps proposal is highly conditional and faces regulatory 
hurdles 
a pacificorp spokesman said the company is studying its options 
and that no decision had been made on what the company will do 
next the spokesman said the company is still interested 
pacificorp said it had intended its offer to be friendly and had 
left the door open for a complete restructuring of arrangements 
including a cash purchase of pinnacle wests largest unit in place 
of the proposed merger 
pinnacle wests subsidiaries include arizona public service co 
arizonas largest electric utility pacificorp is a portland 
orebased electric utility whose service territories cover seven 
states 
pacificorp has said it hopes to acquire arizona public service 
because aps summer high power needs would complement the winter 
high power needs of pacificorps existing utility operations in the 
northwest 
pacificorps previous offers were made in november and december 
the first was approximately 17 billion for just aps while the 
second was for about 2 billion for all of pinnacle west minus 
merabank a troubled thrift which since has been seized by the 
federal government 
pinnacle west never responded to the first offer and its board 
on dec 14 rejected the second which was made dec 1 
in rejecting the offer pinnacle west said it was conditional on 
various terms including the equity of aps liabilities of other 
subsidiaries and several regulatory matters 
our board strongly believes that the best course for pinnacle 
west is to continue as an independent company and allow our 
shareholders to benefit directly from any improvement in the 
company snell added 
pacificorp said its latest offer represented a premium of 75 
percent above market value the company had put the premium of its 
dec 1 offer at 52 percent 
we increased our offer to reflect pinnacles resolution of its 
merabank obligations refinancing of its debpt and additional 
analysis of the benefits of merging pacificorp electric operations 
with arizona public service pacificorp chief executive officer 
al gleason said monday in a statement 
pacificorp spokesman ed grosswiller said the 17 billion of the 
latest offer includes 21 billion for aps and 850 for two other 
pinnacle west and the arizona companys debt of 12 billion he 
said 
pinnacle west last month reported a 5514 million loss for last 
year the company said the loss was due mostly to discontinued 
operations at merabank and malapai resources co a uranium 
subsidiary 
as to pinnacle wests foreseeable future i see a company 
focused on a recovery plan that wont be accomplished overnight but 
one certainly moving in the right direction snell said

pan am corp has formally objected to eastern 
airlines proposed sale of its prized latin american routes to 
rival american airlines saying the deal would hurt airline 
competition 
pan am the nations eighthlargest airline said monday it had 
filed its objection with the department of transportation in 
washington pan am asked the department to conduct a hearing on the 
proposed 471 million sale 
the transaction must be approved by the department and federal 
bankruptcy court in new york where eastern filed for chapter 11 
protection from creditors last march after pilots flight 
attendants and machinists struck the miamibased airline 
in order to preserve the competitive balance in miami certain 
specific routes that are a part of the proposed transfer to 
american should instead be awarded to pan am new yorkbased pan 
am said in a statement pan am asserted that it rather than 
american should be awarded service from miami to guayaquil and 
quito ecuador lima peru and bogota colombia 
pan am also said it should be given the miamitoronto route 
also included in easterns agreement with american 
pan am said it objects to the wholesale acquisition of a 
comprehensive network of valuable restricted routes giving 
american in one fell swoop an entrenched position at miami 
american the nations largest carrier agreed in late december 
after months of haggling to buy the latin american routes from 
eastern the sale would reduce eastern to about twothirds its 
prestrike size 
the transfer would convert miami from a threecarrier 
competitive hubto a twocarrier hub that eventually may be 
dominated by american airlines pan am said 
easterns other latin american destinations include guatemala

a federal judge has scheduled an april 
30 trial to determine if florida can enforce state pollution laws 
against amtrak and its practice of flushing toilets along the 
tracks 
us district judge howell w melton has set aside three days 
for the nonjury trial in jacksonville 
the trial will decide whether amtrak and its officials can be 
sentenced in a state criminal case the railroad lost in december in 
palatka 
the state charged that amtrak illegally dumped raw sewage from 
its trains and that some entered creeks and rivers a circuit 
court jury found amtrak guilty but melton issued an injunction 
halting a jan 18 criminal sentencing 
amtraks attorneys contend the rail service is exempt from state 
environmental law and that the state laws interfere with interstate 
commerce 
the case stems from a florida game and fresh water fish 
commission investigation into amtrak dumping in november and 
december of 1988 and may of 1989 amtrak was charged with dumping 
wastes into rice creek and the st johns river 
state attorney john tanner who took amtrak to court on the four 
felony charges because the specific dumping occurred in his 
northeastern florida judicial district has said he will not seek 
to jail any amtrak officials in the case but wants the dumping 
stopped

the producers of perrier sparkling water began 
resupplying their distributors today three weeks after ordering 
the recall of 160 million bottles worldwide 
the company said bottles marked with the words nouvelle 
production would be available wednesday in french stores and 
throughout most of europe canada and the eastern united states by 
early april 
the new bottled water will be available in the western united 
states by april 22 perrier said 
us importers plan to spend 25 million on a marketing campaign 
aimed first at building anticipation of the return of the drink 
that became a status symbol in the 1980s and then to rebuild sales 
of the topselling imported bottled water brand in the united 
states 
ads scheduled to run wednesday in 22 majormarket or national 
newspapers will use the theme perrier worth waiting for 
a companion radio campaign also will be used in the 15 biggest 
markets that takes a humorous approach using the format of the 
perrier news network detailing reported sightings of perrier in 
various locations 
a new advertising campaign is being prepared for use when the 
beverage is in wide circulation across the country 
ronald v davis president and chief executive of the perrier 
group of america told a news conference in new york that he 
expects the first bottles of the new perrier to start appearing in 
new york in early april 
he said the beverage will begin showing up in other us markets 
over the next 60 to 90 days he said it will take until the end of 
summer to make all varieties of perrier available throughout the 
united states 
davis declined to estimate what the cost of the recall has been 
but said perrier normally could have expected sales of 30 million 
during the four months it will have been either off the market or 
in limited distribution 
but at the same time he said retailers have given about half of 
the shelf space that perrier would have occupied to other brands 
distributed by perrier group including poland spring arrowhead 
and calistoga 
the recall was announced feb 14 after traces of benzene a 
cancercausing chemical were found in perrier samples in several 
countries including the united states canada west germany the 
netherlands and denmark 
benzene a naturally occurring chemical used in cleaning 
solvents entered perriers bottling line when workers failed to 
replace a filter the company said 
perrier said today that an international team of experts using 
extremely sophisticated techniques would ensure that the 
mineral water henceforth was pure 
our task now is to serve the consumer whoser patience 
confidence and understanding has deeply touched us said 
perriers president gustave leven who founded the company in 1948 
the company said it had commissioned a survey in france 
britain the united states and canada indicating that four out of 
five perrier drinkers would start buying the sparkling water again 
as soon as it became available 
the company said it had not yet been able to calculate the 
worldwide cost of the resupply program 
in france unlike other countries the recall was voluntary 
some supermarket chains cleared their shelves of the product while 
other shopowners continued to sell it

some drivers hired by greyhound lines inc to 
replace strikers in the sometimes violent 4dayold nationwide 
walkout have quit 
there have been a few of them that have left and we are not 
surprised by that greyhound spokesman george gravley confirmed 
monday after sources who refused to be identified said some 
replacement drivers have walked off the job 
in the companys central region covering the northern third of 
the country roughly from pittsburgh to denver 32 replacements have 
quit the sources said 
unions representing 6300 drivers and 3000 maintenance workers 
began the strike friday 
gravely estimated that about 8 percent of the replacement 
drivers had quit or 56 of the 700 first hired but he said the 
departures occurred in the first two days of the strike and have 
not caused the company to reduce service 
an internal message sent to greyhound reservations and district 
officials said the company is being forced to lower its level of 
service in the central region partly because of the loss of newly 
hired drivers 
but gravley said the change was forced mainly because fewer than 
expected replacements were hired 
as for those who quit he said they knew what they were 
getting into these people were recruited and they were told 
honestly and forthrightly the nature of the work we told them 
that there could be times when they might be intimidated 
shots have been fired at a bus in chicago a striking driver was 
killed when he was crushed by a bus backing up to get around a 
picket line in redding calif and vandalism of buses been 
reported around the nation 
chairman fred g currey has said greyhound can withstand the 
strike in part because more than 6500 people have applied to be 
permanent replacements for the drivers greyhound maintains it will 
be at full service before the end of march 
currey said 350 union drivers are at work and the company is 
providing about 29 percent of its normal service though that rate 
is as high as 50 percent in the denver area the union said only 95 
members have crossed picket lines 
the strike began over wages and job security friday when 
contract negotiations collapsed no full scale talks have been held 
since 
in another development a judge in portland ore on monday 
barred strikers from interfering with replacements 
the potential for someone to be injured or killed is 
tremendous circuit judge robert w redding said six other such 
orders have been issued nationwide

de beers consolidated mines ltd the huge south 
african diamond mining concern said today it would split itself in 
two and base one of the newly formed companies in switzerland 
the move appeared to be an attempt by the company to minimize 
its exposure to potential political turbulence in south africa 
where a newly energized black majority has vowed to nationalize 
major industries if it wins power from the white minority 
but de beers chairman julian ogilvie thompson denied that there 
were political reasons for the companys split saying it reflected 
the international nature of de beers and the diamond business and 
that it was in the interests of shareholders and the industry he 
also said the companys earnings jumped 37 percent last year 
thompson made his comments at a johannesburg news conference to 
which london reporters were hooked up 
de beers shares jumped 180 pounds or 297 to 1363 pounds 
or 2249 on londons stock exchange today after thompson spoke 
the south african company will continue to be called de beers 
consolidated mines de beers foreign businesses which accounted 
for 80 percent of de beers 1989 net profit will be grouped under 
a swiss company to be called de beers centenary ag it said 
de beers said it would split itself by giving existing 
shareholders one share in the centenary company for each de beers 
share they already own 
ogilvie thompson also denied that the decision was linked to the 
failure of minorco sas failed hostile takeover bid for the british 
mining company consolidated gold fields plc last year that bid by 
minorco which is controlled by de beers and the anglo american 
corp was seen as a move by the gold and diamond mining empire to 
diversify away from south africa 
ogilvie thompson said the plan had been under active discussion 
since last year 
de beers said its earnings for 1989 came to 287 billion rand 
about 11 billion at current exchange rates vs 209 billion rand 
in 1988 revenue rose 31 percent to 42 billion rand from 32 
billion rand 
the company didnt break out quarterly or sixmonth results

raising the cost of postage isnt like 
stamping a new price on cereal or changing the sticker on a car 
congress which once had final say on stamp prices surrendered 
that authority in 1971 when it established the quasiindependent 
us postal service 
but it set up a lengthy and complex system for rate changes when 
they do occur 
as in any business postal managers keep track of their costs 
and income and decide when they are losing money and a rate 
increase is needed theres no longer a taxpayer subsidy to pay the 
difference 
the first step is to go to the board of governors a 
presidentially appointed panel that supervises the post office 
operation 
if the board agrees with the managers it votes to request a 
rate increase and sends that plan along with a detailed 
justification to the independent postal rate commission 
the commission a separate presidentially appointed board has 
10 months to consider the request it solicits comments from 
individuals and businesses holds hearings and conducts studies 
before sending a series of recommendations back to the board of 
governors 
if those recommendations are the same as the original proposal 
or close enough that the board finds them acceptable the governors 
can set a date for the new rates to take effect 
if the governors disagree they can ask the commission to 
reconsider come up with a new set of proposals themselves or if 
they vote unanimously can overrule the commission and put the 
original proposed rate into effect

the plan would involve the persian gulf states of saudi arabia 
kuwait qatar oman bahrain and the united arab emirates 
according to oil industry officials attending a threeday meeting 
of petroleum refiners 
gasoline consumed in the uae will be leadfree by the year 
1995 said mohammed abdullah alojeil head of the united arab 
emirates team 
mahmoud sayar of the gcc secretariat said that all gcc states 
now have their own plan to produce leadfree gasoline 
qatar is to start producing leadfree gasoline by the year 1993

octane level of unleaded gasoline 
lead has long been used as an additive to improve the 
performance of automobile engines but studies have shown that it 
is highly polluting and that in concentrated doses it can cause 
brain damage and mental retardation especially among children 
unleaded gasoline was introduced in the united states in the 
1970s and has more recently been distributed in european countries 
as well 
the 11member organization of arab petroleum exporting

the panic in the pits has passed but not the 
ensuing push for commodity market reform a sensitive subject that 
is foremost on the minds of futures brokerage executives meeting 
this week in florida 
last years futures industry association meeting was a tense 
affair despite the traditional tropical setting as brokerage and 
exchange officials fretted over the revelation two months earlier 
of a trading fraud investigation at the chicago board of trade and 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
since then 48 people have been indicted and 16 have pleaded 
guilty to federal charges of cheating customers and fia leaders 
say the futures industry has stabilized 
i think its much more relaxed this year said david vogel 
chairman of the new yorkbased trading company lit america inc and 
vice chairman of the fia a trade association headquartered in 
washington with about 270 member firms 
the 1200 people attending this years fia annual meeting in 
boca raton which begins wednesday expect to hear from lawmakers 
federal regulators and exchange officials on their progress toward 
restoring public confidence in the futures markets 
despite its problems vogel said the futures industry is 
healthier financially than the layoffriddled securities industry 
futures are contracts to buy and sell agricultural commodities 
and financial instruments at a price agreed upon before the 
delivery date 
fia chairman david ganis said talk about congressional 
reauthorization of the commodity futures trading commission the 
federal regulator of futures trading is likely to dominate the 
meeting at least 18 members of congress including some who have 
proposed reform measures are expected to speak at the convention 
most of them on saturday 
one of the most hotly debated reform issues in the 
reauthorization process has been dual trading the practice among 
floor brokers of trading for their own accounts as well as their 
customers critics contend the practice invites fraud proponents 
say it makes futures markets more efficient 
last year the house of representatives passed a cftc 
reauthorization bill that would sharply curtail dual trading until 
futures exchanges demonstrate an ability to detect wrongdoing to 
the greatest degree that is technologically and humanly possible 
the senate is expected to vote on a similar bill this spring 
cftc chairman wendy gramm will address the convention on 
thursday and is likely to tout reform measures the regulatory 
agency is pursuing on its own including limits on dual trading 
tougher recordkeeping rules and increased use of undercover cftc 
staffers in the trading pits 
leaders of the chicago and new york futures exchanges also will 
attend to discuss the progress they have made on electronic trading 
systems that would supplement and possibly replace facetoface 
trading in commodity pits several exchanges also are working on 
handheld electronic devices that would replace the paper cards on 
which traders record their transactions 
ganis president of chicagobased northern futures corp said 
the florida meeting will show there is no oneshot cure for 
commodity fraud but that everyone in the industry is contributing 
to a solution 
we need to create an understanding that all of these actions 
not just a law here a regulation there but all of these actions 
taken together will result in improved investor confidence in our 
markets he said in a telephone interview thats the key 
issue 
exchange officials are likely to criticize the bush 
administrations budget proposal for an 11centspertrade fee on 
futures transactions which they say will drive business away from 
us markets to cheaper exchanges overseas 
other issues likely to be addressed in florida include proposals 
to increase the margin or down payment on stockindex futures and 
to transfer regulatory authority over stockindex futures from the 
cftc to the securities and exchange commission 
both proposals stem from the perception that computerdriven 
program trading techniques involving index futures inject harmful 
volatility into the stock market futures exchange leaders say that 
perception is erroneous

the us postal service today began the 
complex process of adding a nickel to the price of mailing a letter 
with a record 16 billion loss looming in this fiscal year 
postmaster general anthony m frank says the increase is necessary 
the postal board of governors voted for increases averaging 19 
percent and affecting virtually all classes of mail 
the charge for first class is to rise from a quarter to 30 cents 
next year with each additional ounce increasing from 20 cents to 
23 cents 
post cards would cost 20 cents rather than 15 to send and rates 
will also rise for advertising magazines parcels and other types 
of mail 
even at 30 cents postage is one of americas best buys 
said frank 
that increase would be somewhat more than the rate of inflation 
said frank who promised to hold postal spending below the 
inflation rate at least through 1995 
unlike a store manager however frank cant simply slap a new 
price tag on the goods 
the proposal must go to the independent postal rate commission 
which has 10 months to consider the request hold hearings and 
issue a report 
if the commission agrees rates can go up if not its back to 
the drawing board unless the postal service board of governors 
votes unanimously to overrule the commission 
any rate increase would not occur before early 1991 
but even though the process is only beginning sides are being 
chosen for the battle 
vincent r sombrotto head of the 315000member national 
association of letter carriers contends that stamps today are 
cheaper than they were in 1971 if inflation is taken into account 
sombrotto held a news conference monday to defend the rate hike 
and to denounce critics of the post office who have called for 
private business to be allowed to compete in mail delivery 
james c miller who was federal budget director under president 
reagan is spearheading the campaign in favor of private 
competition and consumer advocate ralph nader is trying to 
organize opposition to the proposed rate increase 
while firstclass mail rates attract the most public attention 
new charges would cover all classes of mail groups representing 
magazines newspapers advertisers and other large mailers will be 
intensely interested in the proposals 
postal charges last increased in 1988 frank has said he hopes 
to have only one more price rise in this century 
when the old post office department was converted into the us 
postal service in 1971 it was directed to operate like a business 
and break even over the long haul the massive tax subsidy that had 
been used to hold down postage rates was phased out 
the postal service has posted five surplus years and five loss 
years in the the last decade finishing 1989 about 61 million in 
the black the agency had a 404 million surplus in the first 
quarter of 1990 but rising costs are expected to push it well into 
the red by the end of the year 
postal officials anticipate a 16 billion loss this fiscal 
year the largest ever for the agency 
contracts with the four largest unions representing more than 
800000 postal workers also expire this year and negotiations for 
new pacts are expected to lead to higher costs 
even at 30 cents for a firstclass letter american postal rates 
will be the lowest in the industrialized world officials say 
firstclass rates are the equivalent of 307 cents in australia 
and 325 cents in canada the rate amounts to 335 cents in 
switzerland and 339 cents in britain it is the equivalent of 405 
cents in france 428 cents in japan 564 cents in italy and 599 
cents in west germany 
here is a rundown of the firstclass rates in use since 
universal rates were introduced in 1863

the governors of the us postal service voted 
tuesday to raise rates including a nickel jump in the cost of 
mailing a firstclass letter but there could as much as a year of 
skirmishing before any increase takes effect 
even at 30 cents postage is one of americas best buys 
said postmaster general anthony m frank noting that us postage 
remains the lowest in the industrialized world 
the proposal calls for the cost of a firstclass letter to 
increase from a quarter to 30 cents with the price for each 
additional ounce rising from 20 cents to 23 cents post cards would 
cost 20 cents also up a nickel while express mail would go from 
875 to 975 
overall rates will increase by about 19 percent on all types of 
mail 
we cannot ignore that increases in postal operating costs do 
occur just as they do in any business robert setrakiam 
chairman of the board of governors said after the vote 
he estimated the increase would cost the average person between 
10 and 11 a year 
frank said the increases are needed because the post office 
could face its biggest deficit ever this year between 14 billion 
and 16 billion 
the governors vote was the first step in a nearly yearlong 
process needed to increase mail rates 
in addition to the firstclass increase the proposal would 
raise the cost of mailing a typical weekly newsmagazine from 135 
cents to 16 cents while a heavier monthly publication would rise 
from 297 cents to 374 cents 
the parcel post rate for a 7pound package would rise from 4 to 
506 
some rate cuts were included for specially prepared business 
mail that requires little work on the part of the post office 
the skirmishing over postal costs and efficiency began even 
before the vote was taken 
on monday vincent r sombrotto president of the national 
association of letter carriers contended that postage today is 
cheaper than it was in 1971 when inflation is considered 
but consumer advocate ralph nader is unhappy both with rising 
rates and service 
the people are going to have to save the post office from 
itself said nader who proposes setting up an organization of 
people who use the mail 
business which will feel increases most in terms of total 
dollars is also unhappy with the prospect of paying more tracey 
schreft of the us chamber of commerce called the planned increase 
unreasonable and unjustified 
robert kamerschen head of advo system inc the nations 
largest advertising mailer said he was concerned that raising 
rates would drive profitable mail out of the postal system when 
its needed most 
the proposed increase would be somewhat more than the rate of 
inflation but frank promises to hold rates below inflation at 
least through 1995 he has expressed the hope that rates might have 
to increase only one more time in this century 
increasing the cost of a postage stamp isnt a simple process 
the proposal must go to the independent postal rate commission 
which has 10 months to consider the request hold hearings and 
issue a repert 
if the commission agrees rates can increase if not its back 
to the drawing board unless the postal board of governors can 
muster a unanimous vote to overrule the commission 
at any rate an increase will not occur before early 1991 
while firstclass rates attract the most attention new charges 
would cover all classes of mail 
groups representing magazines newspapers advertisers and other 
large mail users are particularly concerned with any changes in the 
discounts for largevolume mailers who do some of the work 
themselves for example large mailers can get lower prices for 
presorting their mail arranging it by zip code or even according 
to the route walked by carriers 
postal charges last increased in 1988 three years between rate 
increases has been about average over recent years 
when the old post office was converted into the us postal 
service in 1971 it was directed to operate like a business 
breaking even over the long haul the massive tax subsidy that had 
been used to hold down postage rates was phased out 
the postal service posted five surplus years and five loss years 
in the last decade finishing 1989 about 61 million in the black 
the agency had a 404 million surplus in the first quarter of 1990 
but rising costs are expected to push it well into the red by the 
end of the year 
contracts with the four largest unions representing the more 
than 800000 postal workers also expire this year and negotiations 
are expected to lead to higher costs 
for comparison postal officials report that firstclass rates 
in australia are the equivalent of 307 cents and canadians pay 
325 cents the rate amounts to 335 cents in switzerland and 339 
cents in england it is the equivalent of 405 cents in france 
428 cents in japan 564 cents in italy and 599 cents in west 
germany 
early in us history the cost of mailing a letter varied 
according to distance at one time the price was paid by the 
recipient not the sender 
when universal rates were introduced in 1863 they were for a 
halfounce the rate was changed to a perounce basis in 1885 
here is a rundown of the firstclass rates in use since 1863 
march 3 1863 2 cents per halfounce

sen howard metzenbaum said tuesday the labor 
department is not adequately policing the nations 17 trillion 
pension system and suggested white collar criminals are getting 
preferential treatment 
im concerned that our government isnt willing to prosecute 
white collar criminals as aggressively metzenbaum dohio said 
at a hearing on the governments pension investigations 
but david ball who heads the departments pension benefits and 
welfare administration said several people have been convicted of 
fradulent pension and gone to jail 
metzenbaum also complained about the bush administrations plans 
to fire the labor departments acting inspector general raymond 
maria who has feuded with the department over its handling of 
pension investigations and suggested changes to the system 
you should have the administration cheering for you not 
seeking to remove you from your job said metzenbaum chairman of 
the senate labor and human resources subcommittee on labor 
maria whose ouster is believed to be imminent has said the 
department improperly relies on civil instead of criminal remedies 
in policing the nations pension system 
maria also has said problems with the pension system rival those 
blamed for the savings and loan crisis 
but ball called comparisons to the sampl crisis inflammatory 
rhetoric that was needlessly alarming millions of retirees 
ball said the pension system with assets that have grown from 
290 billion to 17 trillion in 15 years is a great success 
story of the american economic system 
metzenbaum called it a disaster waiting to happen and said 
balls tenure at the labor department had been disappointing so far 
i know nothing youve done except to speak out for the 
business community to tell them pensions are going to be left 
alone metzenbaum said 
labor secretary elizabeth dole has asked congress to approve 
funding for an additional 100 agents to police the pensions system 
and is studying marias suggestions she has also said private 
citizens should be encouraged to sue pension officials who misuse 
the funds 
in effect the secretary has thrown up her hands and said she 
cannot do the job metzenbaum said it is absurd for the 
department of labor to say that they cannot protect workers 
pensions 
ball defended the departments pursuit of civil remedies and 
said criminal investigations are turned over to the justice 
department where he said they belong 
maria has asked congress to in effect overrule a justice 
department ruling from last year that prohibited inspectors general 
from launching their own investigations 
maria is expected to be replaced by julian de la rosa secretary 
of the st louis police board

the acquisition will give the italian company a presence in the 
us life insurance market for the first time said us 
representative giorgio balzer 
balzer spoke to employees tuesday afternoon assuring them the 
company planned to keep operations in kansas city said bma 
spokesman alex matthews 
he indicated that the company will be growing in kansas city 
that they would be adding to the base that we have here now

holding company in 1988 with interests in real estate insurance 
services and venture capital 
it also owns 69 percent of home office reference laboratory a 
lenexa kan company that is one of the nations largest 
bloodtesting firms for health insurance policies

company 
generali will receive shares in home office and be represented 
on its board 
we believe this transaction is in the best interest of bma 
corporation shareholders both because of the attractive financial 
terms and also because of generalibmas continuing relationship 
with horl said tom grant president and chief executive officer 
of bma corp his father founded the insurance firm in 1909

1000 nationwide matthews said about 750 employees in kansas city 
work for the insurance division 
the company sold its individual health insurance line and went

new coke the reformulated sweeter version of 
cocacola that inspired a consumer rebellion before sinking to the 
bottom tier of soft drink sales is trying out a new name and a 
different look its maker said tuesday 
cocacola co said it plans to test market new coke under the 
name coke ii spokesman randy donaldson said coke ii would be sold 
initially in one city which he would not identify within the next 
few months 
the formula of the newly named drink will not be changed 
donaldson said 
industry observers speculated that if the new name was adopted 
the company could return the cocacola brand name to the original 
formula now called coke classic 
jesse meyers the greenwich conn publisher of the industry 
newsletter beverage digest said the coke ii test marks the first 
big shot of the 1990s in the cola wars between cocacola and 
archrival pepsi cola 
meyers said he has seen the proposed packaging for coke ii and 
its red white and blue design with blue lettering closely 
resembles that of pepsi cokes donaldson said the coke ii can is 
red white and blue but unlike pepsi it has a red background with 
white letters and a blue outline 
the coke ii test comes as new coke regarded by some as one of 
the great blunders in marketing history nears its fifth 
anniversary 
atlantabased cocacola announced in april 1985 that after 
extensive taste tests it was changing the formula of coke the 
worlds bestselling soft drink consumer reaction against the new 
sweetertasting product was so strong that the company two months 
later apologized and brought back the original formula under the 
name cocacola classic 
coke classic regained the position as the no 1 soft drink new 
coke also remained but its market share now is a relatively tiny 
14 percent compared to coke classics 20 percent share 
coke officials always have maintained that new coke despite its 
cocacola label essentially is a new product and that its sales 
should be judged in that respect 
donaldson denied that the coke ii test means the company is 
running up the white flag on new coke 
after five years new coke is no longer new though its still 
called new coke he said we just want to make it easier to 
distinguish between coke ii and coke classic 
and he said there are no plans to change the name of cocacola 
classic back to cocacola there are no plans to change anything 
about coke classic at all he said 
but meyers a respected observer of the soft drink industry 
said the name coke classic may be on the way out 
emanuel goldman who follows the soft drink industry for paine 
webber inc in san francisco said the coke ii label if adopted 
would remove the perception that new coke is a failure 
cocacola is the premier brand name in the world he said 
you dont want something called cocacola that doesnt work 
so you call it coke ii goldman said i think its not such a 
bad thing to do the name of the game is cocacola 
pepsi spokesman tod mackenzie called the coke ii test an 
acknowledgement by coke that pepsi was a superior product 
whether its coke ii or new new coke its another validation 
of cokes interest in the great taste of pepsi mackenzie said 
from his office in purchase ny 
this isnt the first time theyve tried to imitate us and it 
likely wont be the last he said 
cokes recent advertising has pitted diet coke rather than 
cocacola or coke classic against pepsi 
meyers said he expected cocacola now wants to position coke ii 
against its competitor 
theyve had a very subtle approach he said if this 
approach works theyll go to a gross allout attack

the julydecember exports brought total sales for 1989 to 732 
million bags up from 652 million in 1988 when the coffee 
organizations system of export quotas was limiting supplies to 
prop up prices 
the quota system was abandoned on july 4 when producer and 
consumer member governments failed to agree on the terms for its 
continuation 
in the sales freeforall that followed the wholesale price of 
coffee collapsed and hit a 14year low earlier this year 
brazil lifted its exports in 1989 to 18269 million bags from 
17082 million in 1988 and colombian shipments rose to 10828 
million from 9784 million 
most other countries recording sharp improvements were latin 
american producers of the prized mild arabica variety of bean 
mexican exports last year rose to 4427 million bags from 2775 
million in 1988 guatemalas were up at 3067 million from 2479

the dollar was mixed tuesday closing mostly 
higher in domestic trading after falling overseas in the absence of 
any major developments to move the foreign exchange markets 
gold prices were mixed 
the dollar declined in early going due to trader speculation 
that an interest rate hike in japan which would bolster the yen 
against the dollar was imminent when the increase never 
materialized the dollar recovered some ground in europe although 
still closed down from mondays levels 
the dollar then moved higher against most currencies in new york 
robert ryan senior foreign exchange trader with bank of new 
york co said the market shied away from testing the upper end of 
the dollars trading range the point at which central banks 
including the federal reserve would be expected to step in and try 
to push the dollar down 
the bank of japan intervened in asian dealings overnight 
selling the dollar lower dealers said the fed sold dollars for yen 
late in the day in the european market but the impact was minimal 
the dollar closed in new york at 14985 yen up from mondays 
149025 yen in europe it closed at 14975 yen after slipping 045 
yen in earlier tokyo trading to 14950 yen 
ryan said traders generally were awaiting the labor departments 
employment report for february scheduled for release on friday 
the market expected the nations nonfarm payroll to have expanded 
by 225000 jobs indicating that the economy is stronger than many 
have thought 
such a report is expected to move the dollar higher because the 
fed is less likely to nudge us interest rates downward which 
would diminish returns on dollardenominated investments when the 
economy shows signs of strength 
the dollar fell against the british pound tuesday in new york 
sterling was quoted at 16475 up from 16445 late monday and in 
earlier london dealings it rose to 16495 from 16390

quarter likely would be lower than firstquarter net income in 1989 
also the company sold off four subsidiaries in 1989 not three 
and the companys divisions did not post a loss for that year

paramount communications inc reported tuesday 
its firstquarter profit tumbled 694 percent from results a year 
earlier that included a big contribution from a financial services 
company that has since been sold 
the publishing and entertainment giant said its earnings rose 
812 percent in comparison with earnings from continuing operations 
last year excluding the results from the associates financial 
services unit 
paramount said it earned 212 million or 17 cents a share in 
the three months ended jan 31 compared with earnings of 692 
million or 58 cents a share a year earlier 
the firstquarter 1989 results included 575 million or 48 
cents a share from discontinued operations mainly from the 
associates which was sold in october for 335 billion to ford 
motor co 
revenue for the quarter rose 93 percent to 8446 million from 
7731 million a year ago 
the latest results include net interest income of 379 million 
mainly from the investment of proceeds of the associates sale 
martin s davis chairman and chief executive said he expects 
the company will earn between 210 a share and 260 a share for 
the year 
the company said its operating income from entertainment was 
lower despite a sharp gain in television operations because 
contributions from motion pictures failed to match strong results a 
year ago 
gains in television results stemmed mainly from higher operating 
income from home video operations the success of the arsenio 
hall show and entertainment tonight and increased 
contributions from paramounts 50 percent interest in usa network 
the company posted a larger operating loss in publishing than a 
year ago reflecting the impact of more conservative accounting 
procedures adopted in the fourth quarter of 1989 
gains in higher education consumer and international publishing 
operations were more than offset by seasonal losses in school and 
supplementary education operations lower earnings in professional 
information lower royalty income related to the silhouette romance 
book line and higher operating expenses

regulating a securities firm like drexel 
burnham lambert inc without financial data on its parent company 
is like being a doctor who can only examine part of the body the 
head of the securities and exchange commission told a senate panel 
on tuesday 
sec chairman richard c breeden used a budget hearing before the 
commerce subcommittee of the senate appropriations committee as an 
opportunity to lobby for additional authority 
questioned about the recent collapse of drexel breeden said one 
difficulty for the sec was lack of data about the parent holding 
company which filed for bankruptcy code protection last month 
the sec regulates brokerdealers but not their parent companies 
which dont have to disclose their financial status 
legislation pending in both the house and senate would give the 
sec access to such financial data 
breeden likened the limitations on such information to being a 
physician who can only look at the right arm from the elbow to 
the wrist its very unrealistic 
the bush administration is seeking 1924 million for the sec in 
1991 a 14 percent increase over the 1990 appropriation of 1687 
million 
breeden noted that congress should be mindful that sec revenue 
production through filing fees have significantly exceeded its 
appropriations 
he pointed out that in 1989 while receiving only 1426 million 
in appropriations the sec generated 2138 million in fees 
but sen ernest f hollings dsc chairman of the 
subcommittee asked why the administration was seeking to increase 
sec fees an estimated 80 million in 1991 
why are you increasing the fees when you got more than enough 
to run the business did you recommend any increases he asked 
this proposal is not a commission proposal said breeden 
ahh there we go said hollings prompting laughter in the 
cramped hearing room in the capitol building 
hollings hinted that the fee increase might be an administration 
move to cut the deficit but sen warren rudman rnh noted that 
the fee increase approved by congress last year was only 
temporary and the latest administration request would make it 
permanent

a federal judge on tuesday refused to bar a 
former philips industries executive accused of insider trading from 
selling more stock in the company but froze about 1 million of 
his assets 
us district court judge walter rice approved a request by the 
securities and exchange commission for the temporary freeze on 
robert h brethens assets being held in an escrow account the sec 
sought the freeze to assure payment of any future damages 
the sec has asked the judge for a preliminary injunction to keep 
brethen a former philips vice chairman from trading his philips 
stock rice refused to grant a temporary restraining order pending 
a hearing 
an sec civil lawsuit against brethen last week alleged he used 
nonpublic information about unfavorable company news to avoid 
570000 in losses in the stock market in january when he sold 
109733 shares for more than 2 million on the new york stock 
exchange 
the sec claimed brethen would continue to violate securities 
laws unless he is restrained from further securities trading 
the judge had postponed a ruling on the temporary restraining 
order from last week after the sec alleged brethen lied to the 
commission and tried to cover up his access to inside information 
the case is considered unusual because the government said three 
attorneys and a stockbroker for brethen have testified that they 
advised him not to sell the stock because it may violate securities 
laws 
brethens violations are continuing jeffrey zuckerman 
assistant regional administrator for the sec said in a letter to 
the judge brethen was engaging in an ongoing violation in 
january when he was caught in the breach by the commission 
rather than cooperate with the commission however brethen 
compounded his violations by engaging in an attempt to cover up 
the letter said 
sec attorney james tyne said in court last week that brethen may 
be financially strapped because of a new business venture celstar 
group inc and might lose the 1 million he had earlier agreed to 
place in escrow after the sec launched an investigation 
david cupps brethens attorney said his client has cooperated 
fully with the sec including giving voluntary testimony and 
should have his money returned to conduct his business 
brethen 63 retired at the end of last year from philips a 
manufacturer or components for construction and recreational 
vehicles previously he had been president and chief executive of 
the compny 
cupps said brethen no longer has access to inside information 
and sold some of the stock only after an attorney assured him doing 
so would be proper 
but tyne said there was a very strong likelihood of repeated 
violations because brethen still owns 100000 shares of philis 
stock misled the sec and ignored the advice of at least three 
lawyers not to sell the shares 
the sec alleged brethen sold the stock while possessing 
nonpublic information that philips earnings would be dramatically 
lower than expected for the final quarter of 1989 which would have 
an adverse impact on a proposed buyout of philips

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
took their biggest plunge in more than 15 years in january the 
government said tuesday analysts described the 54 percent drop as 
temporary and not widespread but said it still indicated an anemic 
manufacturing economy 
the commerce department said orders for durable and nondurable 
goods fell to a seasonally adjusted 2277 billion the steepest 
drop since they sank 7 percent in december 1974 
a sharp 105 percent january decrease in durable goods orders 
to 1178 billion led the plunge 
a 288 percent drop in transportation orders accounted for 85 
percent of the durable decline said economist michael p niemira 
of mitsubishi bank in new york 
obviously if 85 percent of it is in transportation that 
doesnt say that it is widespread niemira said 
automakers laid off 90000 workers in january while they 
attempted to shave bloated inventories but most workers have since 
returned and niemira said motor vehicle production increased 30 
percent in february 
that will feed directly into this report next month he said 
also down in january were orders for aircraft which had shown 
huge increases the previous two months and for defense goods both 
sectors are volatile and niemira said both the boeing co and 
mcdonnell douglas corp already have reported increased aircraft 
orders during february 
aside from those three sectors basically industry is showing 
a modest pace of growth explained economist priscilla trumbull 
of drimcgrawhill in lexington mass fairly small but at least 
its growing 
economic weakness has been concentrated in the manufacturing and 
housing sectors since the federal reserve began its highinterest 
policies to curb inflation both sectors are often sensitive to 
interest rates since their products often are financed by loans 
the commerce department reported the 105 percent decline in 
durable goods orders last week saying it was the biggest drop in 
32 years of recordkeeping and surpassed the previous record of 92 
percent set in february 1982 during the last recession 
it followed a 12 percent gain in december which was revised 
down from 19 percent reported last month 
orders for nondurable goods rose 08 percent to 1099 billion 
in january after falling 05 percent in december the december drop 
was revised downward from a 03 percent gain reported last month 
defense orders fell 288 percent to 695 billion in january 
after dropping 133 percent a month earlier excluding defense 
factory orders were off 44 percent 
orders in the key category of nondefense capital goods a 
barometer of business investment plans fell 142 percent in 
january to 381 billion reversing a 141 percent gain in december 
shipments of manufactured goods dropped 19 percent in january 
to 2266 billion inventories rose 07 percent to 3739 billion 
nearly offsetting a 05 percent decrease in december 
if inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new 
orders it could signal production cutbacks in the future as 
factories attempt to get rid of stored goods 
among the durable goods orders electrical machinery was down 
155 percent to 192 billion most of which was in communications 
equipment 
nonelectrical machinery including computers and a wide variety 
of industrial equipment rose 24 percent to 223 billion primary 
metals were up 12 percent to 111 billion

with west germanys daimlerbenz group to form a series of joint 
ventures between the industrial giants in aerospace electronics 
and other fields

two largest business groups giving mitsubishi a toehold in a 
united european economic comunity in 1992 and daimlerbenz access 
to japanese technology

industries such as aerospace electronics and the service sector 
that would benefit from development on a global scale and make 
effective use of the skills of both groups 
japanese newspapers reported wednesday that the companies had 
signed an agreement to pursue cooperation in many areas including 
mounting a challenge on us dominance of aerospace technology

expand the relationship beyond the automotive sector where 
mercedes benz and mitsubishi motors corp have enjoyed close 
ties mitsubishi said

daimlerbenz expressed pleasure at having gained greater 
familiarity with each other and agreed to hold further meetings in

to meet once a year and he expected the next meeting would occur 
in 1991 
the companies both make motor vehicles and electronics equipment 
and are active in the aviation and space fields

daimlerbenz companies whose executives attended the meeting were 
roughly comparable 
they were mitsubishi motors and mercedesbenz in the automotive 
sector mitsubishi electric and aeg in electrical systems and 
components mitsubishi heavy industries and deutsche aerospace in 
aircraft and aerospace equipment and mitsubishi corp and 
daimlerbenz inter services in trading and investment services 
mori said the weekend meeting evolved from a meeting last 
november in europe between mitsubishi corp president shinroku 
morohashi and daimler benz chairman edzard reuter morohashi was in 
europe to mark the offering of mitsubishi shares on the london and 
paris stock exchanges mori said 
morohashi and reuter led their companies executives at the 
singapore meeting the spokesman said

group of related firms and is japans largest trading company with 
transactions in the last fiscal year of 118 billion
