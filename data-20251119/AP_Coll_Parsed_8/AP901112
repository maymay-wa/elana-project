just a minute karlyn kohrs campbell 
hold on there kathleen hall jamieson 
what do you think youre doing 
you set out to write a serious scholarly maybe 
justalittledull book about the crucial role that language plays 
in the making of a successful presidency 
you say you want to demonstrate rhetoric to be a fundamental 
constitutive element of the presidency 
that youve done 
the university of chicago press published it 
the title is deeds done in words presidential rhetoric and 
the genres of governance 
it is full of arcane language and heavy thoughts 
the special character of presidential inaugural addresses is 
defined by these general epideictic features and by the nature of 
the inauguration ceremony you write 
stuff like that 
you didnt set out to write one would think a feminist tract 
but that youve done too 
youve dedicated your book to the women who should have been 
president to the women who tried to be president to the women who 
will be president 
in footnote 12 to chapter 4 you drop your bombshell youve 
read every state of the union address ever delivered and 
discovered that in these speeches women are invisible 
through 1966 you write they are mentioned only twice 
once in relation to polygamy by ulysses grant once in relation 
to suffrage by woodrow wilson more recently they have been 
alluded to indirectly in ronald reagans statements opposing 
abortion 
and to drive home your point about the maleness of presidential 
vision you turn to a linguistic device you use sic to show 
that the words quoted are reproduced exactly as they appeared in 
the original 
you use sic to show that in their most formal rhetoric 
presidents have always talked about and thought about he when 
they might have said and thought about he or she 
in this book sic is a scythe 
look 
quoting the constitution the president shall from time to 
time give to the congress information on the state of the union and 
recommend to their consideration such measures as he sic shall 
judge necessary and expedient 
quoting george washington the magnitude and difficulty of 
the trust to which the voice of my country called me being 
sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her 
citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his sic qualifications 
could not but overwhelm with despondence one who ought to be 
peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies 
quoting theodore roosevelt our aim is to recognize what 
lincoln pointed out the fact that there are some respects in which 
men sic are obviously not equal 
quoting harry truman in all that we do we should remember 
who we are and what we stand for we are americans our forefathers 
sic had far greater obstacles than we have and much poorer 
chances of success 
quoting lyndon johnson for our ultimate goal is a world 
without war a world made safe for diversity in which all men 
sic goods and ideas can freely move across every border and 
every boundary 
whats up 
in an interview author jamieson dean of the annenberg school 
of communication at the university of pennsylvania ducks 
thats my coauthor says ms jamieson we let the senior 
author do the stylistic stuff if it had been up to me id have 
settled for a statement in the introduction you can make the point 
once your readers are smart enough 
so senior author campbell professor of speechcommunication at 
the university of minnesota what are all these sics here for 
as kind of a reminder to the audience about the very real male 
character of political thinking in this country in the past i 
dont think of it as a feminist book but i think of it as a book 
that has some feminist sensibility 
so take note mister sic presidents

a roofer fell off a roof onto a live 
electrical line monday where he hung for 20 minutes until rescuers 
could shut off the power and lower him to safety 
jack robinson a subcontractor for roof pro of newberg near 
portland accidentally touched a 13000volt power line with a 
piece of sheet metal he was using to help roof a threestory 
apartment building 
the jolt knocked him from the roof and he landed on his abdomen 
on a 110volt wire about 30 feet above a sidewalk he was 
eventually removed by a fire crew using a cherry picker 
by the grace of god i didnt hit the sidewalk jack robinson 
said from his bed in emanuel hospital and health center where he 
was being treated for burns to his hands and his thigh 
the first few thoughts that went through my mind were my wife 
and kids and my life insurance policy because i figured this was 
it he said 
portland fire bureau crews arrived within minutes told robinson 
to hang on and placed mattresses gathered from apartments on the 
ground and held a safety net 
bureau spokesman neil heesacker said firefighters were 
reluctant to put a ladder up to get him because the minute they 
touched him they would ground him and probably electrocute him 
portland general electric shut off the power and dispatched a 
picker which firefighters used to rescue robinson 
robinsons boss max wright said robinson was working on a 
ledge on the top of the roof when an 8foot piece of sheet metal 
robinson was carrying touched the power line 
as he fell he landed on a wire down below it kind of caught 
him across the middle wright said his legs were hanging on 
one side and his torso was on the other 
wright said robinson managed to maintain a sense of humor about 
the incident even telling a coworker this is the way you dont 
do it as he hung from the wire

joel chaiken changes diapers cleans house and 
is the chief caretaker of his toddler son he does everything the 
other mothers in his bronx neighborhood do his problem is hes not 
a mother 
thats why he was banned from a local mothersinfant group 
which deemed his male persona non grata 
chaiken 32 tried to join the riverdale neighborhood house 
support group last october when his son benjamin was 7 months 
old 
i thought basically it was a place to go during the day and 
meet new people a place to find out about baby care to find out 
real information the kind your pediatrician cant give you a 
place for benjamin to socialize and a place for support to a 
certain extent 
instead he found a closed door 
chaiken is trying to pry it open by filing what is believed to 
be a precedentsetting discrimination suit the state division on 
human rights recently decided chaikens case has merit and has 
ordered a public hearing 
we found enough reason to believe he was treated differently 
because he was a man said felicia clavell of the state agency 
some in riverdales uppermiddle class neighborhood some 11 
miles north of midtown manhattan say thats the way it should be 
there are mothers and there are dads and hes not a mother 
said caryl malka 33 boiling the argument down to basics 
i would feel very uncomfortable talking about personal things 
in front of him the twotime mother and former group member 
said its not a play group its not just about the semantics of 
scheduling or diapering its women getting together and talking 
about very intimate things and a man joining the group would really 
change that 
chaiken agrees but he doesnt think thats negative 
i think it would change for the better once they learn a real 
man could be understanding and compassionate their own 
relationships might change 
women dont have a monopoly on emotional support and 
compassion toward others said chaikens wife sue ellen dodell 
who encouraged her husband to file the complaint 
gender equality is important to the couple thats evident in 
the surname they chose for their child it isnt one name or the 
other or a hyphenated version but an equal combination of the two 
chaidell 
its also evident in the chaikendodellchaidell familys 
toystrewn living room littered with everything from a diapered 
baby doll to pickup trucks 
chaiken said they decided at conception that he would give 
up his 37000ayear engineering job to care for their child 
dodell 35 is a lawyer for the city 
his wife suggested he join the group after seeing an 
advertisement in a local paper inviting mothers with babies up to 
1 year old to come and relax with a cup of coffee and enjoy 
each others company while they care for their babies 
the ad said topics included easing the transition into 
parenthood new routines infants sleeping and eating habits 
talking to your pediatrician and choosing child care 
chaiken attended an open house and told social worker etty 
barshai who runs the group that he was interested in joining 
she said it was full and that i should check again in january 
chaiken said 
the center limits the group to 10 members there were four in 
the group the semester chaiken applied 
he said he continued asking questions about the group but i 
got the feeling she was uncomfortable 
the next day chaikens wife called to ask about joining and was 
told sure theres spots open why dont you come in for an 
interview when he confronted ms barshai she told him the 
group was only for mothers 
as a woman dodell said i understand some may feel 
uncomfortable at first but i think they should just give him a 
chance and see i really think they could benefit from his 
perspective 
but that she said is the emotional side of the issue 
legally she believes the center is plain wrong its a place 
of public accommodation and joel should be permitted in the group 
period 
riverdale neighborhood house is a nonprofit center that receives 
city and state funding for a variety of educational and support 
programs 
the state human rights agency agrees and will argue chaikens 
viewpoint at an as yet unscheduled hearing clavell said 
they placed an ad and said come one come all join us but 
when mr chaiken took them up on the offer they said oh no you 
have to be a woman when you invite the public that includes 
men clavell said 
donald cohn a vice president at the center and an attorney at 
the highpowered park avenue law firm of webster amp sheffield 
insists there was no discrimination 
he took advantage of other programs at riverdale house and he 
was invited to participate in other programs cohn said this 
one was just not appropriate for him 
after the hearing an administrative law judge will make a 
recommendation and state commissioner of human rights douglas white 
will issue a final order the case may take longer than a year to 
resolve 
chaiken realizes the decision will come too late to benefit 
benjamin who at 19 months old is already happily ensconced in a 
toddlers group albeit not at neighborhood house chaiken said he 
was allowed to join the toddler group at the center but was already 
committed to a different program 
so why are we fighting on were fighting on because this 
issue really has to be resolved said chaiken its really to 
help future fathers who stay at home so they wont have to go 
through this battle dodell added 
besides they said the decision may come in time for child no

eight years ago a folk music group 
from neighboring greece came to this ethnic greek village in 
southern albania the audience waited hours in burning heat but 
neither smiled nor applauded 
a witness said the people turned out to demonstrate ethnic 
identity but dared not show emotion in the albania of stalinist 
dictator enver hoxha 
hoxha died in 1985 and by oct 26 1990 things had changed 
foreign minister antonis samaris of greece was welcomed like a 
20th century messiah when he visited gorandsi and nearby 
derviciani another ethnic greek settlement thousands of people 
surged past uniformed and secret police simply to touch or smile at 
him 
albanias communist rulers have given hints of reform and are 
gradually losing control of the 32 million citizens they repressed 
for half a century 
startling evidence of the change came in july when thousands of 
albanians sought refuge at foreign embassies in tirana the 
capital and were allowed to emigrate 
outside pressure has grown for improvements in human rights 
particularly from the 2 million ethnic albanians in neighboring 
yugoslavia 
if it wants to rejoin europe as it says albania must lift the 
ban on religion imposed in 1967 allow free speech and honor its 
promise made before the mass emigration of passports for all 
wishing to travel abroad 
an illustration of the communist leaderships dilemma was the 
samaras visit to a minority albania says numbers 80000 and greece 
by including all the greek orthodox faithful puts at more than 
400000 
trucks blocked the road to gorandsi samaras stopped his 
motorcade and insisted on his scheduled visit to 1000 people who 
awaited him in the dusk 
men from the sigurimi the albanian secret police were 
sprinkled liberally through the crowds in both villages 
in derviciani a senior albanian official threatened to expel a 
greek journalist who was handing out greeklanguage books to 
children 
a woman identified by greeks as veronika kallas emboldened by 
the rare presence of foreigners defied secret police to slip a 
visa request to a greek journalist she said her husband was in 
jail for trying to flee albania 
it shows you have not forgotten us an excited teenager 
said as the crowd showed samaras the former greek orthodox church 
of gorandsi now a dilapidated storehouse with a faded cross etched 
in the stone portal donkeys grazed in the yard 
a woman gestured her eagerness to pray jars with burnedout wax 
on window sills of the warehouse attested to continued reverence 
for the church 
officials contend religion always was alien to albanians that 
the moslem roman catholic and greek orthodox faiths were imposed 
by occupying outsiders over the centuries recently however the 
authorities removed religion from a list of antistate propaganda 
after religion was outlawed many churches and mosques became 
storehouses or ruins only a few are preserved as historical 
monuments 
albania was the only european nation not to sign the 1975 
helsinki agreements on european security and cooperation which 
include comprehensive human rights provisions 
it now wants to join the conference on security and cooperation 
in europe which resulted from the helsinki accords 
albania may have little idea of what such membership entails it 
has isolated itself from the west for two generations broke with 
moscow in 1968 and with china in 1976 
i tell government officials that joining helsinki means 
nongovernment organizations have the right to come here and ask 
why is this church or mosque closed and to get an answer said 
a foreign official speaking on condition of anonymity they 
simply dont understand what that means 
samaras criticism of the host countrys human rights record 
delivered at a conference of balkan foreign ministers in tirana 
was omitted from albanian media reports 
officials were clearly unnerved by having to deal with the 105 
foreign journalists allowed in for the conference and gently urged 
the last eight to leave to do so before their visas expired 
government secrecy makes it virtually impossible to verify 
numerous rumors of human rights violations 
reports of border shootings or torture often arise in greece or 
yugoslavia both have an interest in painting albania darkly the 
greeks because of their minority in the country and the yugoslavs 
because of the restive ethnic albanian majority in serbias kosovo 
province 
kosovos albanians are far freer than citizens of albania 
despite being stripped of provincial autonomy by serbia hunger for 
crossborder contacts is increasing and hundreds of people a day 
apply for visas at the yugoslav consulate in tirana 
in may acknowledging international pressure for the first time 
the albanian leadership published figures indicating only 35 
political prisoners were held 
aleks lasuari a tirana university legal expert told reporters 
the death sentence is reserved only for severe crimes and that 
only three or four people are executed each year 
how deputy foreign minister sokrat plaka handled the samaras 
trip is an example of the governments quandary 
first he insisted to a reporter that those in the enthusiastic 
crowd around the visitor were complaining that greece was not 
issuing enough visas minutes later he pointed at the smiling 
faces and said you see people are happy here in albania

a cruise ship recently embarked on its maiden 
voyage with stateoftheart garbage facilities and a promise by 
passengers to be ecofriendly 
its all an effort to set a new standard for an industry 
dependent on pristine waters 
anyone spotted tossing as much as a cigarette butt into the 
waters of the south pacific from the frontier spirit will be fined 
50 said lars wikander president of salenlindblad cruising the 
ship sailed from guam last week 
even biodegradable matter such as food will not be put 
overboard when were in ecologically delicate regions we dont 
want to disturb the feeding and breeding patterns of animal species 
in these areas wikander said from his headquarters in new york 
the 50 million 164passenger frontier spirit will freeze its 
food and plastic waste grind its glass to sand and burn the rest 
through specially filtered incinerators said wikander who 
contends the ship establishes a new nonpolluting standard for the 
cruise industry 
salenlindblad can afford to install this technology its 
passengers tend to be welloff treehugging environmentalists 
willing to pay a little more and follow strict rules in order to 
see exotic locales 
but even mainstream cruise lines pitching more affordable trips 
to middleclass tourists on the welltraveled caribbean circuit are 
trying to make the most of the ecotourism trend 
people who pay for cruises are escaping to the beautiful 
beaches and crystalclear deep blue waters you advertise in your 
brochures dumping trash at sea even though its within the law 
doesnt fit this image coast guard cmdr darryle waldron told an 
international conference of cruise line officials in miami last 
week 
international regulations forbid dumping of plastics anywhere in 
the ocean but glass paper metal and other garbage can legally be 
tossed overboard 25 nautical miles from shore violators face up to 
25000 in fines 
the coast guard has investigated 57 allegations of illegal 
dumping since the regulations took effect in may 1989 and many of 
the charges are brought by cruise ship passengers waldron said 
once 50 passengers signed a letter claiming they saw the crew 
of their cruise ship dump bag after plastic bag over the side 
its very difficult for ship captains to deny that sort of a 
complaint said waldron who wouldnt identify the ship 
cargo vessels and weekend pleasureboaters are responsible for 
most of the ocean debris waldron said but the cruise ships image 
still suffered when volunteers found more than 65 plastic cups and 
shampoo bottles bearing their insignia in a sept 22 beach cleanup 
of florida beaches 
less than 100 items out of the more than 399666 pounds of 
garbage collected in the center for marine conservation cleanup 
doesnt seem like much but the centers gina ruiz says cruise ship 
trash remains troublesome 
what washes up is only a very small sampling of whats 
actually out there its a significant amount of garbage ruiz 
said 
miamibased carnival doesnt plan to fine anybody for throwing 
trash overboard but its passengers are encouraged to separate 
plastics from glass cans and paper into deckside garbage cans 
and on royal caribbeans newer ships huge sewage treatment 
systems and incinerators that burn at 900 degrees fahrenheit take 
all the pollutants out of the waste released into the air and sea 
said spokesman lloyd axelrod 
were always looking at better ways to nurture the 
ecosystem said axelrod by the time were finished with the 
stuff its extremely clean we feel thats very important

roses are red violets are blue but in 
the guadalupe mountains they can be yellow too 
folks in the lone star state may sing about the yellow roses 
but monday they crowed about a small colony of yellow violets 
discovered hanging from a cliff by a park ranger who had lost his 
way 
the rare flower dubbed the viola guadalupensis or guadalupe 
violet is eligible for listing as a rare or endangered species 
said john cook national park service southwest regional director 
the plant was found march 22 1987 it was verified as a species 
in june and its discovery was announced monday at a conference on 
national parks attended by 350 federal officials scientists and 
wildlife preservationists 
i was hiking up in the mountain alongside of a cliff and it 
was very foggy guadalupe mountains national park ranger brent 
wauer told a press conference at the gathering i was a bit lost 
and i noticed on the side of the cliff face a yellow plant that was 
really not where it was supposed to be 
there are no cliff plants in the park with yellow flowers 
he said 
i knew it was something unusual when i regained my balance so 
i went over and looked at it and it was a yellow violet wauer 
said 
the one small profusion of 35 individual plants with vibrant 
yellow flowers grow in crevices on a limestone formation on the 
east rim of the mountains 
the 86000acre park is near the texasnew mexico line and about 
100 miles east of el paso 
wauer said two other species of violet can be found in the park 
but they follow the rhyme and are blue 
violets despite their name are known to come in hues other 
than bluishpurple including white and yellow 
but this oddball violet appears to be a sturdy survivor of the 
areas ancient rain forest half an inch in diameter with 6 to 
12inch stems the flower is distinguished by the shape of its 
leaves its leaf hairs and its habitat in the pores of limestone 
wauer and a west texas botanist believe most of the species 
disappeared at least 8000 years ago 
these yellow violets arent going to be sitting on window sills 
anytime soon the chances of increasing its population are slim 
the violet was found on a steep shaded cliff face in rugged 
country of the wilderness park the cliff measured 45 feet long and 
30 feet high 
wauer and another person are the only people who know the 
plants precise location a measure taken to protect it 
to me this plant reflects a purity of nature that we 
desperately need so that we can constantly go back to examine where 
were going wauer said we seem to be at war with our planet 
and if we win that war well lose

they sit on plastic chairs in a dimly lit 
corridor some cradling children some reading books all of them 
killing time most are waiting for an answer they already know 
walk into any employment office in what used to be east germany 
and the women outnumber the men they are losing their jobs at a 
faster rate and finding new ones far more slowly 
they are not alone foreigners young people older people and 
the handicapped are also finding it harder to find or keep jobs in 
a quickly sinking economy experts say 
the former nations job market has become a darwinian proving 
ground a battle for survival in which people in the most fragile 
financial and social situations are the first to be fired 
a method of dismissals is at work that is distinguished solely 
by its mercilessness said ulrike peretzkileid a board member 
and social expert for germanys public service transportation and 
traffic union 
employment experts say former staterun businesses desperate to 
survive the painful transition from a socialist state to a market 
economy are getting rid of the workers they believe are most 
likely to hold them back 
women of childbearing age particularly single women with small 
children are the most vulnerable because of traditionally high 
rates of absenteeism to care for children 
women are the first to be given their notice and the last to 
be hired said peretzkileid 
at berlins main jobless office in the former headquarters of 
the communist secret police women outnumbered men at least 5to1 
on a recent day about 60 people crowded the long corridor some 
waiting four hours for their names to be called 
ive been looking for work since february said evemarie 
schmidt 35 a former saleswoman at a clothing store 
ms schmidt who is divorced has a 12yearold son at home and 
draws about 400 a month in unemployment 
for women like me the situation is terrible she said 
karin wernecke who has a degree in political science from the 
old communist school system worked as a prison counselor but has 
been looking for work since march 
ive tried to get job training for factories for computers 
even to work as a hairdresser but i cant even get into a training 
program she said my last chance will be to try to get a job 
as a cleaning woman in west berlin 
mrs wernecke 30 said her husband left her this year she has 
an 8yearold son at home and lives on 330 a month in unemployment 
benefits 
kirsten sell a caseworker at one of several eastern berlin 
social services offices says she handled 1227 new welfare cases 
alone in october about half of them single unemployed women with 
children 
according to government statistics 90 percent of the women in 
what used to be east germany held jobs compared to about 50 
percent in the former west germany 
although they comprised nearly 49 percent of the 84 
millionmember work force women made up 542 percent of the 
537799 jobless last month 
nationwide another 6 percent of the unemployed were under the 
age of 20 19 percent were handicapped and 66 percent were 
parttime workers many of them believed to be women 
that means only 313 percent of the jobless were ablebodied 
males over the age of 20 
klaus grehn president of the unemployment society an activist 
group representing eastern germanys jobless says the 
organizations own research shows that only about 25 percent of the 
relatively few new hires in the region are being filled by women 
he also said dismissals are disproportionately high for younger 
workers who are usually the least experienced and handicapped and 
older workers 
gabriela endertreinhart spokeswoman for the central employment 
office in berlin said jobless information in the former east 
germany is compiled by hand and that no statistical breakdowns are 
available to back up those claims 
but she said the available information does indicate that women 
are being laid off at a faster rate 
an enterprise has a male mechanic and women mechanic and one 
must be fired naturally a woman with a child is going to be the 
one fired she said 
even though east germany was a communist police state the high 
employment among women was credited to the remarkable social 
benefits they were given 
women were guaranteed 20 weeks paid maternity leave single 
parents got four weeks paid leave and unlimited unpaid leave to 
take care of sickchildren 
there also have been widespread reports of soaring unemployment 
among the former nations foreign work force 
lien nguyen phuong who came to east germany three years ago 
said she was among the entire 110member vietnamese work force 
fired on nov 1 at a textile factory in dresden 
she said she wants to remain in germany but has to find work 
within a year 
its difficult enough being vietnamese but a vietnamese and a 
woman she said at least i dont have children

ronald reagan has always said hes a sucker 
for heroes one of the heroes who influenced him the most he says 
is franklin d roosevelt 
reagan who often made much of his admiration for the 
conservative calvin coolidge has much more to say of the 
trailblazing roosevelt in his new autobiography an american 
life 
the 40th president often pictured as an opponent of the kind of 
active government that the 32nd president brought to washington 
argues that he was really aiming at lyndon johnson not fdr 
he quotes roosevelt in support of his free trade views says he 
borrowed roosevelts idea of fireside chats to the people and 
agrees with him on the need for compromise in dealing with 
legislators 
he also says he believes roosevelt never intended for some of 
the new deal programs such as relief or welfare to become 
permanent 
reagans linking of himself with fdr gets some support with 
reservations from presidential scholars 
this is not franklin delano reagan although he would very 
much like to be said roosevelt biographer frank freidel 
some of reagans observations are possibly right freidel 
said in a telephone interview adding i have the feeling that 
roosevelt himself was a good bit more conservative than his enemies 
make him out to be 
i think these are all thoughts of hindsight on the part of 
reagan however freidel said certainly the way he was 
campaigning for goldwater in 1964 was not in the spirit of fdr and 
the new deal 
richard neustadt in the new edition of his classic study 
presidential power described reagan as the last roosevelt 
democrat we shall see as president 
reagans links to roosevelt were important for his 
presidency neustadt wrote fdr in 1933 had changed the 
countrys consciousness of what its government should be and do 
reagan aspired to no less if in the opposite direction 
reagan wastes no time bringing up roosevelt in his book on the 
first page of the first chapter he quotes his words that the 
country was dying by inches in the depression by page 66 he is 
saying i soon idolized fdr 
altogether there are 17 entries for roosevelt in the index for 
coolidge whose picture reagan hung in the white house cabinet 
room there are two 
he writes that when he became governor of california some of his 
conservative backers did not want him to compromise with the 
legislature but he agreed with roosevelt who said in 1933 i 
have no expectations of making a hit every time i come to bat what 
i seek is the highest possible batting average 
when the democratic legislature balked at his programs he says 
he decided to appeal over their heads by going on radio and 
television franklin d roosevelt gave me the idea with his 
fireside chats which made an indelible mark on me during the 
depression it worked better than i ever dreamed it would 
later facing opposition in congress as president he writes 
that meant i had to dip into fdrs bag of tricks and take my case 
to the people 
the former president says the late franklin d roosevelt jr 
often told me that his father had said many times his welfare and 
relief programs during the depression were meant only as emergency 
stopgap measures to cope with a crisis not the seeds of what 
others later tried to turn into a permanent welfare state 
in a 1982 diary entry that he quotes reagan wrote the press 
is trying to paint me as now trying to undo the new deal i remind 
them i voted for fdr four times im trying to undo the great 
society it was lbjs war on poverty that led us to our present 
mess 
nevertheless he also says that in the 1930s the democratic 
party began to change drastically as its leaders began 
creating a government that grew ever larger and increasingly 
demanded the right to regulate and plan the social and economic 
life of the country and move into areas best left to private 
enterprise 
one of the links between reagan and roosevelt neustadt said 
was reagans image of office 
freidel said its just that his whole youth was one of 
thinking that roosevelt was quite wonderful and then in later years 
turning toward more conservative matters and still not wanting 
to get rid of this wonderful symbol this man who meant so much to 
him in his youth 
but said roosevelts biographer he is not as much like fdr 
as he thinks he is he is like fdr in that he has charm and 
persuasiveness in conversation and is full of good anecdotes and 
has enormous political skill 
on the other hand roosevelt worried frightfully about the 
people who were out of work who were dispossessed and homeless 
and did what he could for them in areas like this certainly the 
roosevelt image is rather different from the reagan image years of 
prosperity and his rather lack of concern about those at the 
bottom of the pile 
former speaker of the house thomas p oneill jr seems to have 
told reagan much the same thing 
after a telephone conversation with oneill in 1982 the 
president wrote in his diary tip is truly a new deal liberal he 
honestly believes that were promoting welfare for the rich

the next time the nation picks a president 
the big enchilada of politics california will be even 
bigger 
florida and texas are gaining more stature too as us house 
seats shift to the sun belt and bring with them more of the 
electoral votes that decide who wins the white house 
the seats will shift when new congressional districts are drawn 
next year to reflect the population shifts detected in the 1990 
census 
in 1992 california florida and texas will carry a combined 111 
electoral votes 14 more than they did in 1988 thats 41 percent 
of the 270 needed to win the presidency 
california alone will have gained seven electoral votes giving 
it 54 20 percent of the victory threshold 
its pretty hard to see how youre going to win if you dont 
carry california said gop consultant john sears a top official 
in the 1976 and 1980 presidential campaigns of ronald reagan 
its as close as you can be to a situation where youve just got 
to have it now weve never had anything this big to contend 
with 
the new math of the electoral college means that the 1992 
candidates will be spending more time and money in california and 
with florida and texas also drawing more interest smaller states 
not vital to a candidates electoral puzzle likely will get far 
less attention 
obviously it skews it even more from what it used to be and a 
result will be ignoring more states said lyn nofziger who ran 
the white house political operation for reagan youre going to 
have to focus heavily on those three states 
president bush won all three in 1988 as did reagan in both of 
his winning campaigns so the shift bodes well for republicans 
even more so because the electoral votes going to areas of gop 
strength are coming from the northeast and midwest the democratic 
partys traditional base 
new york for example was the biggest prize with 45 electoral 
votes when john f kennedy was elected in 1960 41 when jimmy 
carter won in 1976 it was down to 36 for the 1984 and 1988 
elections and will drop again to 33 in 1992 
the 1992 shifts will transfer 19 electoral votes in all mostly 
from the northeast and midwest to the sun belt california is 
expected to get seven florida four and texas three new york will 
lose three pennsylvania ohio michigan and illinois will each 
lose two 
this continuing trend is one of the big reasons republicans 
have been strong at the presidential level said sears 
democratic victories in the florida and texas gubernatorial 
races and a gain of two house seats in the south in last weeks 
elections had the party boasting that it had blunted the socalled 
republican realignment in the south 
realignment is a myth said rep beryl anthony of arkansas 
chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee 
realignment is dead 
but the democratic wins in florida and texas had at least as 
much to do with the shortcomings of the republican candidates as 
with the popularity of the winners and dont automatically 
translate into a boost for the democratic presidential nominee in 
two years analysts say 
when the whole republican trend in the south was developed in 
the early 60s there were democratic governors in these states and 
it didnt make any difference said kevin phillips the 
republican analyst who first envisioned a successful southern 
strategy for national gop candidates the state voting patterns 
dont mirror the national patterns 
phillips said texas and florida would prove difficult for a 
democratic nominee to win assuming of course a northern liberal 
nominee california on the other hand is probably a shade 
more liberal than the rest of the country he said so it could 
be an easier trophy for a democrat to win 
sears concurred 
if i were the democrats id concentrate on holding the 
northeast and winning the bigger states of the middle west and then 
taking california he said

emperor akihito formally assumed the chrysanthemum 
throne on monday in rites steeped in ancient tradition but 
reflecting the usimposed postwar constitution that denies him 
the divine status of his predecessors 
despite massive security precautions leftist extremists opposed 
to the monarchy launched attacks on military bases train stations 
and shinto shrines as the late emperor hirohitos son assumed the 
throne which is said to date from 660 bc 
police counted more than 32 guerrilla incidents monday morning 
most in tokyo none of the attacks appeared to cause injuries but 
they disrupted several train lines and a bomb exploded near a 
police dormitory setting two empty houses on fire police said 
akihito wearing a redbrown silk kimono of ancient design sat 
on an elaborate lacquered throne in front of an imperial palace 
courtyard filled with attendants carrying bows and swords 
he vowed to uphold japans modern constitution which 
fundamentally restructures the worlds oldest hereditary monarchy 
on this occasion i pledge anew that i shall observe the 
constitution of japan and discharge my duties as symbol of the 
state and of the unity of the people akihito speaking in 
colloquial japanese told about 2500 guests in the heavily guarded 
palace 
seated on her own throne at akihitos side was empress michiko 
also dressed in full imperial regalia 
under the cloudless skies gong and drum attendants played 
haunting court music for royal family officials and guests 
dignitaries from 158 countries at the ceremony included vice 
president dan quayle and britains prince charles and princess 
diana 
akihito expressed deep love and respect for his father who 
died in january 1989 after a 62year reign that encompassed japans 
crushing defeat in world war ii and spectacular rise as the worlds 
no 2 economic power 
hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war under 
the new constitution akihito becomes the first of japans 125 
emperors including those listed only in legend to take the throne 
as a mere mortal and not a priestking 
the ceremony ended with prime minister toshiki kaifu wearing a 
morning suit instead of traditional garb leading the japanese 
guests in three cries of banzai a wish for long life 
he led the cheers from a spot level with the throne to 
underscore the constitutions emphasis on popular sovereignty 
earlier monday akihito had announced his ascension to the sun 
goddess and his ancestors in private prayers at wooden shrines 
inside the palace 
a blimp floated overhead with a huge sign urging tokyo residents 
to call with any information about suspected terrorist activity 
following the enthronement akihito and empress michiko were to 
change into western clothes and travel in an open car to the 
akasaka palace three miles away officials said nearly 10000 
police would line the route which passes in front of japans 
parliament 
but many japanese were ignoring the ceremonies taking advantage 
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses 
and driving ranges one poll indicated nearly half of the japanese 
were not interested in the enthronement 
a record 37000 police many dressed in full riot gear and 
backed by water cannon were deployed in tokyo to guard the 
ceremonies but could not stop a series of attacks throughout the 
city 
radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases 
and a fourth in western tokyo the defense agency reported police 
reported a similar attack outside the us naval base at atsugi 25 
miles southwest of tokyo 
radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at 
three tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major 
commuter lines police reported 
fires erupted at four shinto shrines in tokyo including one 
less than a mile from akihitos residence destroying two 
radicals and other critics say the coronation and its 
accompanying rites are based too closely on the traditional 
religious rituals used for akihitos father whose name was invoked 
by the militarists who launched the pacific war 
opponents say state funding of the ceremonies linked to japans 
indigenous shinto religion violates the constitutional separation 
of religion and state 
akihito became emperor immediately upon the death of his father 
but a period of mourning was observed before his enthronement 
as with hirohitos funeral which was attended by 
representatives of 164 nations the enthronement provided 
opportunity for a flurry of diplomatic meetings kaifu was 
scheduled to meet with about 50 foreign officials 
the government is reportedly spending 95 million on the rites 
much of it for security 
akihito 56 was tutored after world war ii by an american 
pacifist and is the first emperor in modern japanese history to 
marry a commoner 
he and the empress also raised their three children themselves 
rather than have them raised separately by aides as was the 
imperial custom

on the heels of the lowest election turnout in 
50 years comes a study that says its wrong to blame voter 
alienation make the process easier says the report and more 
americans will cast ballots 
election procedures in the united states make voting 
cumbersome the general accounting office tells congress 
its remedies set registration deadlines to fall on or close to 
election day establish tollfree numbers for absentee ballot 
requests allow voting by mail 
last tuesdays turnout is estimated to have matched that of 
1986 which was the lowest in nearly half a century 
in another report not connected with the preelection gao 
study analyst curtis gans said 26 states and the district of 
columbia had increased voter participation but that only 364 
percent of those eligible to vote nationwide actually did 
the united states ranks 20th among 21 democracies in turnout for 
national elections with only switzerland doing worse 
italy led the pack with a 94 percent turnout followed by 
austria with 893 percent and belgium with 897 percent 
in the 1980 general election in the united states only 526 
percent voted 
a popular explanation of our low and still declining voter 
turnout is that unlike citizens of other democracies americans 
have become alienated from the political process the report 
says this argument assumes that americans increasingly believe 
that politicians cannot be trusted and that the government is 
unresponsive ineffectual or even corrupt 
sometimes too the alienation is attributed to the vietnam war 
and the watergate scandal 
its a plausible explanation but not supported by research 
says gao 
interest in politics attention to political affairs in the 
media and individual political efficacy is consistently higher in 
the united states than in the european democracies the report 
says 
there seems to be no connection between voter turnout and trust 
in government 
only 14 percent of italians trust their government the report 
says but their voter turnout is the highest the american level of 
trust in government is 34 percent compared with 76 percent of the 
swiss and 55 percent of austrians 
europeans vote in greater numbers because national parties in 
some countries are closely linked with specific economic religious 
and other demographic categories in contrast to more diffuse 
crosscutting linkages in the united states that allows political 
parties to develop platforms representing the specific interests of 
groups 
another powerful incentive to voting exists in austria belgium 
and venezuela which impose fines or other penalties for failure to 
vote 
in italy the nonvoter may have his name posted outside the town 
hall gao says and his identification papers may be stamped did 
not vote for five years 
gao says automatic voter registration common elsewhere might 
do wonders in the united states in some countries voters register 
when they renew their drivers licenses 
the committee for the study of the american electorate directed 
by gans said the motorvoter registration adopted in 12 states 
since the 1986 election seems to be a success in 10 of the 12 
states turnout was higher 
gao said as many as 37 states could increase their turnout by 
five or more percentage points by adopting election day 
registration 
arizona which requires registration at least 50 days before 
election could increase turnout by as much as 125 percentage 
points the report said 
as for mail voting the gao said its logical to assume that 
would increase turnout without a major increase in fraud 
we found that allmailballot elections in selected elections 
led to a 20 to 40 percentage point increase in turnout with a cost 
that was at least 32 percent lower on a per ballot basis than the 
cost of conducting conventional pollingplace elections gao 
said

voters in the states of hidalgo and mexico 
cast ballots sunday for state assemblies and mayors of more than 
200 cities and towns in a key test for the longgoverning 
institutional revolutionary party 
the party of president carlos salinas de gortari now controls 
all but a few municipalities in the two states 
governing party officials told reporters shortly after polls 
closed that they appeared to be ahead in nearly all 121 towns in 
mexico state the countrys largest 
earlier they had told reporters privately that they feared 
losing in at least a handful of towns 
opposition party leaders claimed they would make massive gains 
but turnout was low and that could benefit the governing party 
in many voting stations reporters found no one at all waiting 
to drop ballots into the transparent boxes and despite opposition 
charges of fraud most polling stations appeared orderly 
the most optimistic predictions called for no more than a 35 
percent turnout among 45 million registered voters in the state of 
mexico which borders but does not include mexico city 
opposition parties claimed that supporters of the governing 
party had stolen voting boxes organized caravans of multiple 
voters and interfered with poll watchers charges of fraud are 
common in mexican elections 
the mexico state election commission said it had received 
complaints about incidents involving 84 voting places 23 percent 
of the total but election commissions in both states reported the 
voting was generally peaceful 
eight parties fielded candidates in mexico state and seven in 
neighboring hidalgo but only the institutional revolutionary 
party the conservative national action party and the leftist party 
of the democratic revolution were given much chance to score 
victories 
the results were not to be verified for a week 
the state of mexico is the wealthiest of the countrys 31 
states about 80 percent of the 10 million residents live in urban 
areas around the sprawling federal district of mexico city 
the state includes everything from opulent and middleclass 
suburbs to areas such as chalco and nezahualcoyotl where millions 
of rural newcomers live in unspeakable squalor without water or 
electricity 
the governing party known as the pri from its spanish initials 
hoped to benefit in the election from recent construction of roads 
water systems and other services 
hidalgo is a mountainous rural state with many small villages 
the 914041 registered voters there were electing officials in 84 
municipalities 
while the governing party retains its 61yearold control of 
nearly all aspects of mexican politics its monopoly on power has 
eroded gradually in some regions 
voters in mexico city whose mayor is appointed rather than 
elected voted heavily against salinas in the 1988 presidential 
elections which he won by the most narrow margin in the pris 
history 
national action was expected to show strength in the large urban 
areas around the capital while democratic revolution might win in 
some of the small farming areas near michoacan state home of its 
founder cuauhtemoc cardenas 
cardenas asked for a postponement of the election saying the 
pri had rigged the voter rolls and was preparing a cybernetic 
fraud with computers 
electoral officials dismissed the charges saying cardenas had 
time to make them earlier through the state electoral board 
the pri has been known to resort to fraud and strongarm tactics 
to win elections under salinas however the party has instituted 
internal reforms and promised to abide by the voters will 
the reforms included state primary elections to choose local 
candidates doing away with the appointment of candidates by party 
leaders

an agriculture department tollfree hotline is 
doing a brisk business handing out tips on what kind of goodies to 
send the troops in the persian gulf area 
hotline supervisor sue templin said it has received more than 
350 calls about sending food to american military personnel since 
the special service was announced nov 1 
we had a day care center call she said the children had 
decided they had gotten too much halloween candy and they were 
going to send some 
just the hard candy and the candycoated gum should be sent the 
kids were told chocolate melts too easily 
one woman caller had a group of cub scouts in her kitchen 
making those everpopular crispy squares out of puffed rice 
marshmallows and butter or margarine as gulf munchies 
templin said those are less fragile than some items but have a 
high moisture content theyre worth the gamble she said 
about 230000 us troops are in the area now and president 
bush said last week as many as 200000 more will be going soon as 
part of the massive buildup against iraqi forces 
templin expects families and friends of those additional us 
troops will help keep hotline operations humming 
home folks want to send favorite foods and treats to those in 
the gulf but often arent sure what will survive the long trip and 
the temperatures thats where templins crew comes in 
calls are answered during regular working hours by a team of 
home economists and dietitians typically the callers are just 
looking for suggestions about what is good to send and to get an 
idea on what not to send templin said in an interview 
sometimes the advice on what not to send is too late 
in fact weve talked to people whove told us theyve sent 
things that their servicemen have already gotten them and eaten 
them she said one woman said she sent sausages and cheese 
balls i dont know how she packed them but he got them and ate 
them 
the hotline crew worked with usda food scientists military 
experts and the us postal service on a list of dos and donts 
food items that spoil easily should be avoided particularly 
highmoisture baked goods susceptible to mold pork and pork 
products are taboo along with alcohol because those are banned in 
saudi arabia for religious reasons 
one person was dismayed that we had said not to send 
chocolate because thats what their person in the gulf loved 
templin said but that was after the mampms made it over in good 
condition 
templin said air mail service may be getting some of the 
vulnerable items to the gulf quickly enough to prevent meltdown or 
other damage 
a number of people have asked about sending smoked turkeys 
because they think that they would be safe to eat she said 
but theyre not this is a common misconception people have even 
in mailing turkeys in this country 
canned meats and poultry or tuna are safe from food poisoning 
organisms although recipients should avoid the contents of swollen 
or damaged cans that can be a sign of harmful bacteria 
mostly they want to send baked goods templin said from 
talking to people in the military the troops are being wellfed 
so what theyre looking for are treats 
naturally the young man or woman in the gulf would like a 
favorite cake or cookies brownies and similar homebaked items 
but callers are told to send cakes in tins and to bake the harder 
drier kind 
the hotline has been operated for the past five years by the 
departments food safety and inspection service for callers who 
want to ask all sorts of questions about what they eat in the 
fiscal year that ended sept 30 more than 80000 calls were logged 
electronically 
only about half of those were answered personally by hotline 
staffers templin said the rest were at night or on weekends when 
taped messages were available 
many calls relate to usda announcements of recall actions and 
recommendations for consumers who have those products 
the usda tollfree hotline number on weekdays from 10 am to 4 
pm est is 18005354555 residents in the washington dc area 
should call 202 4473333

workers may well respond to pay cuts by stealing 
company property eroding at least part of the cost savings their 
bosses sought a new study says 
employee thefts more than doubled at a manufacturing plant when 
a 15 percent pay cut was imposed and fell back to normal when full 
wages were restored the study found 
an identical pay cut at a comparable plant caused less of an 
increase in pilfering because management explained its reasons 
fully and sensitively researcher jerald greenberg said 
you can make people less likely to hurt the company by 
explaining to them in a socially sensitive anner and a highly 
informative manner why it was necessary for them to suffer this 
inequity said greenberg a professor of management and human 
resources at ohio state university 
the study focused on nonunion factory workers largely 
semiskilled and unskilled it would take further research to know 
if its conclusions apply to other kinds of employees but theres 
good theoretical reason to believe that it probably would 
greenberg said 
another expert in worker psychology said he was skeptical about 
its applicability to white collar workers skilled blue collar 
workers and professionals they might just find jobs elsewhere 
instead of stealing said kenneth de meuse of the university of 
wisconsin in eau claire 
greenberg presents the results of his study in the october issue 
of the journal of applied psychology he said it is not clear 
whether the extra pilfering is aimed at making up for lost income 
or getting revenge 
the study included three midwestern manufacturing plants owned 
by the same company the plants make small mechanical parts mostly 
for the aerospace and automotive industries 
greenberg designated them plants a b and c before the pay cut 
plant a employed 64 workers plant b 53 workers and plant c 66 the 
study lasted for 30 weeks centered on the 10week pay cut 
employee theft was measured by an accounting formula that 
revealed percentage of inventory such as tools and supplies that 
was missing for no other known reason 
at plant a employees were told by the company president that 
pay would be reduced by 15 percent for 10 weeks during the 
90minute meeting the decision was fully explained with charts and 
graphs the president expressed serious regret and said everybody 
would share in the pay cuts with no favoritism 
he spent nearly an hour answering questions 
at plant b the pay cut was explained tersely by a vice 
president in a 15minute meeting no expressions of apology or 
remorse were shared the reason for the decision was not clearly 
described and the vice president said he could answer only one or 
two questions before catching a plane 
at this plant the percentage of inventory apparently stolen 
jumped from about 3 percent before the pay cut to about 8 percent 
during the pay cut it returned to about 3 percent after wages were 
restored 
plant a went from about 3 percent to 5 percent and fell back to 
3 percent again 
at plant c which did not have any pay cut the rate remained at 
about 3 percent through the 30 weeks 
greenberg said the company did not tell him what was stolen nor 
give a dollar value 
de meuse noted that at plant b at which a poor explanation was 
given also had a large jump in resignations during the pay cut 
while plant a was unaffected that shows that good explanations can 
also reduce turnover from a pay cut he said

a few weeks ago senate democratic leader 
george mitchell feared that those were the halcyon days that the 
voters would cut into the 5545 majority he commanded for two years 
in battle with president bush 
he boasted frequently about the accomplishments of the 
justending congress he was almost nostalgic as if time already 
had prematurely dimmed its many shortcomings 
but after last weeks elections mitchell had the calm of 
someone whod won the lottery paid off the mortgage and now could 
do what he really wanted to do he spoke mainly of the future not 
the past 
i think theres a movement our way he said quietly 
chatting in his capitol office overlooking washingtons monuments 
and the white house 
its said to be the secondbest view in washington the best 
being the one that looks back from the other end of pennsylvania 
avenue 
mitchell took over as senate majority leader two years ago after 
winning a tough threeway race for the support of his democratic 
colleagues 
he then had to fight out from the shadow of his predecessor 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia who stayed on in the senate 
as chairman of the powerful appropriations committee 
mitchell had to fight the president on the minimum wage on the 
capital gains tax on aid to china on the civil rights bill on 
clean air on parental leave 
he fought in endless hours on the senate floor and packed in 
more press conferences and television appearances than any of his 
predecessors 
in some cases he managed just a draw and never did the 
democratic congress overpower a bush veto 
but at the end after a brutal showdown on taxes bush began to 
look weak and the democrats stronger then in last weeks 
election the democrats managed to snatch a senate seat away from 
the republicans despite vigorous campaigning around the country by 
the president 
when mitchell first became majority leader his reputation was 
as a scholarly judicial hes a former judge but partisan 
lawmaker now one must add cunning to the list 
i think after feeling his way he ended up with a pretty good 
first congress said stephen hess a scholar at the brookings 
institution who has written about congress and how it is portrayed 
in the news media hes in about as good a position as he can 
be 
on tuesday mitchell will be reelected senate majority leader 
with no opposition he now is confident enough in the job that 
hell be delegating some of the work of running the senate to 
others 
ive always worked hard but ive never been through anything 
like the last two years he said i intend obviously to work 
hard at it but i dont intend to keep up that pace 
for nine years including the last two mitchells top objective 
was passage of a new clean air bill now thats done and he 
intends to concentrate his attention on health care issues 
including longterm care for the elderly 
hes prepared for those issues to take as long as clean air did 
and he doesnt intend to be any more singleminded about health 
care than he was about clean air 
mitchell scored his biggest points for his handling of the 
debate over taxes democrats stalled and stalled until the debate 
moved from whether to raise taxes at all to which tax increases 
were most fair to the middle class along the way bush got labeled 
as the rich mans president 
the democrats intend to keep that debate going 
well i saw in the paper today the president will renew his 
push for a capital gains cut that raises the issue right there 
said mitchell borrowing one of those make my day grins that 
president reagan used to wear 
despite his expanded majority and consolidated power including 
a firmer grip on the senates arcane bureaucracy mitchells life 
in the 102nd congress wont be a cakewalk first among the 
complicating factors will be the several senators of his party who 
will be running for president 
what about mitchell howd he like to trade the secondbest view 
for the best 
he laughs protesting nearly too much no thank you for 
asking im grateful for those who ask

ravels only two operas a spanish hour and 
the bewitched child should delight both adult and child as 
performed by the new york city opera with sets by childrens 
author maurice sendak 
the works began a run of 10 shows saturday at the new york state 
theater performed in french with english subtitles 
a spanish hour had its operacomique premiere delayed from 
1907 to 1911 because of its risque nature now it looks like 
farcical fun 
the stage features what looks like a moving clock from a 
european town square a rooster nods a hat bobs three real people 
move mechanically like clock figures 
the clockmakers wife sung by soprano kathryn gamberoni is 
visited by two lovers a silly poet michael rees davis and a 
pompous mayor jan opalach to keep a mule driver a customer in 
the clock shop from realizing theyre there the woman puts her 
lovers into grandfather clocks and has the strong young muleteer 
carrying those clocks in and out of her bedroom 
the bewitched child is based on a short play about a naughty 
little girl ravel changed it to a boy sung by a soprano in this 
case robin tabachnik 
a garden looking like something from sendaks where the wild 
things are glides across the stage before the childs room is 
seen 
the child shows his bad temper by proclaiming i want to chop 
off the squirrels tail i want to growl at everyone and 
throwing his book out the window 
projected flames dance projected numbers enter jump around and 
pile up so cunningly that the audience applauded 
a princess sung in a sweet clear small soprano by young ok 
shin complains that the child tore up her story what will happen 
to her now 
the stage becomes a forest lighted like a dream trees move in 
and out over steam animals and insects appear at the end the 
child binds a wounded paw and the animals forgive him and let him 
go home

when wall street goes bust they walk on easy 
street when recession hits their business booms 
they are repossessors and auctioneers scavengers of bad times 
who clean up the fiscal wreckage when the economy breaks down 
this is the boom time for us definitely said evan gabriel 
an auctioneer in canton its a real big opportunity 
and they have the 1980s to thank for their success then 
companies and people borrowed freely from banks to buy and build 
then came the crash in new england the sore spot of the 
nations economy scores of banks were left with piles of bad 
loans 
enter the banks foot soldiers repo men and auctioneers 
the repo men take back cars and boats among other things when 
their owners no longer can make payments the auctioneers sell off 
houses and other things the banks foreclose on 
i dont like to say theres a lot more business theres 
enough bad news in the economy we dont need to make it worse you 
know what i mean said ron bethel who repossesses boats in 
mendon but theres more than a moderate increase 
the repo mans stock in trade is expensive cars sometimes 
though the booty is bigger 
jack barnes executive director of national finance adjusters

1980s 
levites usually gets a 10 percent commission to sell boats the 
average boat runs 2000 and levites said his company may move 
four or five a week 
in the new boat business you have to buy the boat and have it 
sit on the showroom floor while you pay interest levites said 
in the repo business the overhead is so much less you dont 
have to buy the boats 
did levites ever think hed become a repo man

an evangelical christian and former 
cabinet minister claimed the lead in guatemalas presidential 
election sunday night and said he hoped to avoid a runoff by 
negotiating with the losing parties 
jorge serrano elias said preliminary returns indicated he would 
get at least 40 percent of the vote in the 12man field 
im not sure if there will be a second round the 
45yearold engineer said it was not immediately clear what sort 
of deal he could make to avoid the jan 6 runoff required if no 
candidate gainst a clear majority 
if the winner takes office as scheduled it would be the first 
time in guatemalas troubled militarydominated history that one 
elected civilian had taken office from another 
as serrano spoke firecrackers crackled and flared outside his 
campaign headquarters and supporters pressed forward to shake the 
hand of the only evangelical christian left in the race 
serrano said he had picked up support from that community which 
includes some 30 percent of the populace after former dictator 
efrain rios montt was forced out of the race by a constitutional 
ban on former coupmakers 
serrano finished third in 1985 presidential elections he also 
took part in a commission that held talks with leftist guerrillas 
aimed at ending the countrys 30year civil war 
there was gloom in the camp of newspaper publisher jorge carpio 
nicolle who had been favored during early polls along with 
serrano and former guatemala city mayor alvaro arzu irigoyen 
no voting disruptions were reported but the violence that has 
marred the long campaign continued to the last minute carpios 
union of the national center said one of its officials in the town 
of el quiche was killed saturday 
on election day however there were no reports of violence or 
interference with the vote said ramiro de leon carpio the federal 
human rights ombudsman 
my impression is that this is a very open honest clean 
election im impressed said us ambassador thomas f stroop 
i hope the vote total is sufficiently big so it cannot be 
attacked as being nonrepresentative 
arturo herbruger asturias president of the supreme electoral 
tribunal said the turnout was not expected to be higher than 60 
percent of 33 million registered voters compared to 69 percent in 
1985 
enough returns to indicate a trend in the results were expected 
by early monday 
the armed forces who cannot vote kept a low profile sunday 
but their armed civil patrols were in evidence in the highlands in 
most places electionday security was left to the police 
guatemala city authorities ordered a special subsidy so that 
people could ride buses free of charge stores and other businesses 
remained closed and the sale of alcoholic beverages was banned 
throughout the day 
a few streets and avenues were strewn with sharp threepronged 
nails to puncture vehicle tires and snarl traffic but residents 
and municipal workers quickly swept the roads clean it wasnt 
known who left the nails leftist guerrillas had called for people 
to boycott the vote 
the winner inherits a 30yearold civil war a bankrupt 
government 60 percent inflation and an epidemic of street crime 
and human rights abuse 
he will also have to contend with a nation where more than 70 
percent of the people live in dire poverty and where the army and 
elite private sector are so powerful that coup rumors are an almost 
daily affair 
the presidential candidates who range from conservative to far 
right filled their campaigns with vague promises to curb crime and 
inflation human rights which implies curbing the armys power 
received scant attention 
guatemalans were also electing a vice president 116 members of 
a new congress 20 delegates to a new central american parliament 
and 300 mayors 
it was the second presidential election since guatemala returned 
from military to civilian rule in 1985 but the high hopes that 
ushered in democracy have already soured to dismay and cynicism 
the corruption and ineptitude of president vinicio cerezos 
government has discredited his christian democrats guatemalas 
largest and bestorganized party and opened the door to an 
electoral freeforall 
cerezo was barred by law from seeking a second term and rios 
montt initially emerged as the frontrunner with a harsh 
lawandorder message 
but he was ruled ineligible and serrano who had served under 
rios montt picked up some of the generals support and became a 
factor 
arzu 44 is from a wealthy guatemalan family and was backed by 
some of the most conservative elements of the private sector he 
has said he would run this nation of 9 million like a business 
enterprise 
carpio 58 who was routed in a 1985 runoff with cerezo was 
backed by a diverse coalition that ranges from the archright to 
disaffected socialists 
the election season brought an outbreak of assassinations 
disappearances and death threats that put guatemala back on the 
international human rights agenda 
it has been an embarrassment for the united states which helped 
provoke 30 years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with leftist 
rebels by backing a military coup against a liberal civilian 
government in 1954 
the united states has poured nearly 1 billion in aid into 
guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985 hoping to 
create a showcase for freemarket democracy

teacher training student testing and textbook 
selection programs are often so flawed that they hinder efforts to 
improve learning a report says 
in a mandated congressional report the chairman of the national 
endowment for the humanities sternly condemned basic us 
educational practices 
lynne v cheney said the nations teaching methods are 
tyrannical machines a phrase coined by philosopher william 
james to describe procedures that become both counterproductive and 
resistant to change once established on a large scale 
in addition cheney denounced school textbook selection 
committees that choose material without reading them college 
education programs in which potential teachers spend little time 
studying what they eventually will teach and university systems 
that value research more than teaching 
tyrannical machines dominate american education and have 
contributed to its failures cheney said in the report the 
most effective course for dealing with tyrannical machines is to 
provide alternative systems and to ensure that people can choose 
and choose wisely among them 
because of that cheney said allowing students and parents to 
decide where to attend school is one of the most promising ways 
of dismantling tyrannical machines and revitalizing the schools 
when there are alternative ways to become a teacher or to 
choose textbooks or to assess students and when people know about 
them it is more difficult for outmoded and unsatisfactory methods 
to dominate healthy competition is anathema to tyrannical 
machines she said 
the report won accolades from deputy education secretary ted 
sanders who said we need a revolution in teaching and 
learning 
but rod kelchner president of mansfield university in 
mansfield pa said that while cheney makes some valid points 
they are overridden by generalizing and bashing to the point of 
absurdity 
the scholastic aptitude test described in the report as the 
centerpiece of our educational system filled an important need 
when first devised in the 1920s when officials wanted to detach 
college entrance examinations from the high school curriculum now 
cheney said the sat tries to avoid testing what students have 
learned about subjects such as history and literature 
in the past 10 years the test has been attacked repeatedly yet 
it continues to thrive and to exercise considerable power she 
said not only do institutions of higher education rank students 
by their sats they in turn are ranked by them their status going 
up or down depending on the average scores of the incoming class 
secondary schools are judged by sats local housing prices 
rise and fall principals and superintendents are hired and fired 
and the entire nation reaches conclusions about the state of 
american education 
cheney said an alternative would be to expand the use of the 
national assessment of educational progress saying it was the sole 
assessment tool that is both nationally representative and 
comprehensive in calculating what americas students know and can 
do in various subject areas 
college board president donald stewart took issue with cheneys 
assessment of the sat saying she makes some thoughtprovoking 
and some extremely questionable statements 
in a nation with over 26000 secondary schools with varying 
curriculums and teaching and grading standards the sat provides 
an independent objective verification of a students mathematical 
and verbal reasoning abilities skills that are important to 
academic success in college he said 
stewart also noted the college board recently agreed to revise 
the exam away from mainly multiple choice questions in 1994 
among the numerous recommendations cheney said 
prospective teachers should be able to choose paths to 
certification different from the traditional one this will bring 
diversity to the teaching force allow comparisons of teacher 
training techniques and encourage schools of education to improve 
their programs in order to compete 
teachers in the schools should have abundant opportunities to 
study the subjects they teach 
those involved in textbook selection should make use of 
textbook reviews done by scholars and teachers in the field to make 
informed choices schools should be encouraged to use alternatives 
to textbooks stories speeches documents and other authentic 
materials 
colleges and universities should develop alternative paths to 
recognition and reward paths that emphasize teaching as well as 
research

soviet high school students who didnt 
know the number of republics in the soviet union would have flunked 
their geography exams a year ago today no one is sure of the 
answer 
lithuania is out or soon to be chuvashia however is in 
latvia estonia karelia and georgia are saying goodbye as fast as 
they prudently can tatarstan komi mari dniester and gagauz are 
ready to take their places 
sometimes its hard to know where you live anymore said 
pyotr gorbanenko a legislator in moldavia which is simultaneously 
seeking independence from the soviet union and trying to put down 
two internal separatist movements 
it used to be simple in 1988 the soviet union had 15 
republics each with its own legislature scattered among them were 
20 smaller autonomous republics or homelands for various 
ethnic groups 
the country has been fragmenting since president mikhail s 
gorbachev loosened moscows grip on power and allowed aggrieved 
minorities to speak out 
that hampers gorbachevs plans for nationwide economic reform 
and getting an agreement among the republics to replace the 1924 
treaty of union it also has led to violence most recently in 
moldavia 
several regions are trying to secede following the lead of 
lithuania which declared independence in march 
in addition to the baltic republics there are strong 
independence movmements in karelia a district of about 140000 
people north of leningrad that wants to join neighboring finland 
the western ukraine where many people want unification with 
poland and the southern republics of armenia georgia and 
azerbaijan 
regions that dont want to leave the soviet union also are 
pushing for sovereignty several regions are actually trying to 
become soviet republics 
some ethnic minorities such as moslem abkhazians in georgia 
want to break away from larger groups they accuse of 
discrimination 
others such as the tatar chuvash komi mari and chukchi 
peoples in the russian republic seek to raise their legal status 
from district to autonomous republic or from autonomous to 
fullfledged republic their goals include political power 
cultural preservation and control of natural resources 
ethnic and political friction has led repeatedly to violence in 
the past two years in moldavia last week the regional government 
sent troops to clear roadblocks set up by separatists who had 
declared a new republic east of the dniester river at least four 
people were killed 
the unrest stemmed from a combination of historical injustices 
ethnic grievances and unfounded rumors a typical mix that shows 
how explosive selfdetermination can be in a nation whose borders 
have changed often in the 20th century 
moldavia which had been a soviet republic since 1924 more than 
doubled in size at the start of world war ii when stalin annexed 
neighboring bessarabia from romania under a secret protocol of his 
nonaggression treaty with hitler 
for the next 45 years soviet leaders relentlessly pursued a 
policy of russification they made russian the official language 
instead of romanian encouraged cultural assimiliation and sent 
russians to run schools industries and political posts 
anatol f plugaru an ethnic moldavian and former member of the 
republics communist party central committee told the associated 
press he had access in 1987 to a list of the moldavian 
nomenklatura the top government business and law enforcement 
jobs controlled by the party 
although russians made up only 15 percent of the republics 43 
million people he said they filled twothirds of those positions 
that began changing last year thanks to gorbachevs reforms 
competitive elections gave ethnic moldavians a parliamentary 
majority including a substantial bloc of delegates aligned with 
the proindependence peoples front 
the new parliament voted in august 1989 to make romanian the 
official language while the law said moldavian citizens retained 
the right to speak russian it required all people in jobs dealing 
with the public from doctors to hairdressers to pass tests in 
romanian by 1995 
protest strikes were held by russians and ukrainians who are 
concentrated within moldavias prewar borders east of the dniester 
they formed yedinstvo a group pressing for moldavia to remain in 
the soviet union 
plugaru claims the russians were were afraid of losing their 
privileged positions which they shouldnt have had to begin 
with 
ilya trombitsky a legislator who sides with the russian 
minority said the language law was a clear attempt to favor one 
ethnic group over another and caused widespread fear of moldavian 
nationalism 
protests also broke out last year in the gagauz region a 
southern corner of moldavia inhabited by about 150000 descendents 
of christian turks who fled religious persecution in bulgaria in 
the early 19th century 
yuri roshka a leader of the moldavian peoples front said 
russians from the dniester area artificially incited discontent in 
gagauz 
gagauz leaders say their people were legitimately angry over the 
language law and lack of investment in their underdeveloped 
agricultural area 
the conflict boiled over this fall when the gagauz and dniester 
regions declared themselves soviet republics and went ahead with 
elections for new legislatures 
plugaru says he is confident moldavia will remain whole and 
gradually move toward independence after convincing gagauz and 
dniester residents they have nothing to fear 
trombitsky said he expects the dniester area to remain part of 
the soviet union while western moldavia eventually reunites with 
romania possibly taking gagauz along 
we are all victims of history he said we must learn to 
respect each others rights because bloodshed is no answer

stormie jones painful journey which ended 
with her sudden death at age 13 six years after her pioneering 
heartliver transplant blazed the way for other multiple 
transplants doctors say 
weve been able to provide better quality of life and longer 
life for many people because of stormies ordeal dr jorge 
reyes staff physician at childrens hospital of pittsburgh said 
after stormie died there sunday 
but stormie didnt like being under a media spotlight 
acquaintances recalled 
she wished everybody would treat her normal instead of like 
she had an operation because she didnt like everybody asking her 
how she felt or if she was feeling ok said crystal millikan 
stormies best friend in her hometown of white settlement texas a 
fort worth suburb 
stormie endured organ rejection and hepatitis after her historic 
double transplant on valentines day 1984 and a second liver 
transplant this february 
she went through a lot of pain you know as a guinea pig and 
as necessity her stepfather alan purcell said at dallasfort 
worth international airport before flying to pittsburgh 
the pain is over with purcell said she doesnt hurt any 
more 
stormie was rushed from her home to a texas hospital saturday 
night with a sore throat and fever she then was flown to the 
pittsburgh hospital 
stormie was dehydrated when she arrived reyes said her 
condition didnt appear serious then but it deteriorated rapidly 
hospital spokeswoman lynn mcmahon said 
her mother at her side stormie went into cardiac arrest and 
died at 952 am doctors tried for more than an hour to 
resuscitate her 
preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive but reyes said 
that if strmie had a flu virus it could have caused a rapid or 
irregular heartbeat 
funeral arrangements were pending ms mcmahon said 
stormie was 6 when she became the first person to receive a 
transplanted heart and liver since then university of pittsburgh 
hospitals have performed at least 10 other transplants involving 
the liver and another organ 
no national statistics are kept on multipleorgan transplants 
most have been performed at the universitys hospitals the only 
ones authorized to use fk506 an experimental antirejection drug 
stormie was taking 
the nation knew her as a brave teenager but stormie was famous 
around childrens hospital for her generosity to other patients 
she once bought a book on chinese so she could communicate with a 
3yearold patient in the toddlers language 
she did that kind of thing all the time mcmahon said she 
was just so highly regarded by other children she went to great 
lengths to take the time to play with them and talk with them 
with her strength she gave strength to other children 
reyes said 
stormie required the multiple transplant because her own organs 
were harmed by familial hypercholesterolemia blood cholesterol 10 
times higher than normal 
hepatitis damaged the transplanted liver and stormie received a 
second liver transplant in february 
the girl returned to childrens in may after her body began 
rejecting the liver and again in june because of hepatitis 
she was released from the hospital after a few weeks but she 
and her mother lois susie purcell stayed in the city until 
the infection was controlled 
doctors at the time determined stormie had developed the same 
type of hepatitis that damaged her first transplanted liver but 
didnt know why 
although any transplant patient is susceptible to infection 
because antirejection drugs weaken the immune system i wouldnt 
particularly focus on the fk506 as a specific cause reyes said 
doctors family and friends often had marveled at stormies 
determination to recover from her many physical setbacks 
i guess its just hope theres a thing in the back of your 
head that says get up stormie once told reporters

the threat of war in the persian gulf shadowed 
veterans day observances from the vietnam veterans memorial in 
washington to an army post in eastern saudi arabia 
it looks like many people will be marching in next years 
veterans day parades with a banner saying desert shield 9091 
2nd lt benjamin lacy 23 of largo fla said at the mideast post 
on sunday 
the human cost of any offensive against iraq to liberate kuwait 
is a question thats on everybodys mind lacy said 
it was on peoples minds here too 
its just a matter of time until the united states is at war 
again bob horsch of rahway nj a veteran of army service in 
vietnam told a reporter at the vietnam memorial sunday 
horsch said he believes the military buildup in the persian gulf 
is the right thing to do because it is in the interest of the 
united states and other countries 
stephen reuben of lapwai idaho a member of the nez perce tribe 
who also served in vietnam declined to say whether he believed the 
buildup was a good idea but said he fears the country will go to 
war 
i am afraid so but i pray and hope we dont reuben said 
teresa swain of hagerstown md when asked if she supported the 
buildup said we have to protect our interests as to whether 
it would mean war she said i certainly hope not mrs swain 
said she has a soninlaw in the air force 
at arlington national cemetery secretary of defense dick cheney 
placed a floral wreath at the tomb of the unknowns and told a crowd 
of about 5500 those who have been deployed to the persian gulf 
and saudi arabia are probably the besttrained soldiers we have 
ever had 
meanwhile the jury selecting a design for a memorial to women 
who served in vietnam to be built adjacent to the vietnam 
veterans memorial announced that it has selected two finalists 
instead of one winner 
one of the winning designs by sculptor eileen rose barry of 
east islip long island is a statue of a woman standing alone with 
a helmet in her hand 
she looks like she has been to war and she is going somewhere 
else said juror raquel ramati a new york urban desgner she 
is dignified and courageous but she looks like she is part of the 
human race she is not superwoman 
the other finalist by landscape architect robert diamond of 
arlington mass consists of 240 jets of water with a large white 
marble block at the center the white will contrast with the black 
marble wall with the names of more than 58000 vietnam war dead on 
it that is the central feature of the vietnam memorial 
ms ramati said the ninemember jury was divided veterans 
favored a representational sculpture designers leaned toward an 
abstract design 
diane carlson evans director of the project said the two 
finalists would be asked to refine their proposals and the final 
design would be a collaboration of the two the target date for 
dedication is 1992 
at the vietnam memorial representatives of military and 
patriotic groups placed wreaths in front of the wall as a bagpiper 
played abide with me 
the national park service estimated the crowd at 5000 the 
weather was bright and sunny with a crisp wind 
the ceremonies were held on sunday the traditional veterans 
day although today is the official national holiday 
veterans day is not a holiday for the 230000 american troops 
deployed in the persian gulf but many remembered their fellow 
soldiers who fought in previous wars 
lacy said veterans day means many people before me put their 
life on the line many died some are scarred for life its time 
to honor them 
fortysix soldiers have died so far in operation desert shield 
which was launched in response to iraqs aug 2 takeover of kuwait

the uss williamsburg once harry s 
trumans official presidential yacht is rotting near a sewage 
plant on the potomac river outside washington and faces demolition 
the vandalized 243footlong hulk has trees growing through its 
deck and is covered with broken glass and empty beer bottles the 
kansas city star reported sunday 
if no one takes the former beauty of black steel teak trim and 
mirrorpolished brass it faces demolition in july 1992 the 
newspaper reported 
through the years the williamsburg has had a variety of owners 
it had a brief stint as a floating restaurant in new jersey in 
1969 and before that the national science foundation in norfolk 
va used it as a laboratory the star said 
the ship became available about two weeks ago to anyone who 
could prove to the district of columbia that it would be restored 
said kim nielsen chief of photography for the smithsonian 
institutions freer and sackler museums 
people have no conscience about destroying things of historic 
value said nielsen a nautical history buff 
they want to see george washingtons teeth and abraham 
lincolns chair but here we have president trumans yacht where 
he spent half of his presidential career and nobody cares 
nielsen is trying to find a future for the yacht and he 
envisions the midwest as its brightest hope independence mo to 
be more specific trumans home 
but the idea of moving the williamsburg to the midwest is 
hopeless local leaders and entrepreneurs say 
its one of those cases where the powers that be have turned 
their backs on it said richard lynn a kansas city kan 
riverboat operator who researched the possibilities of the 
investment 
its nothing but a rusting hulk 
the ship weighs 2000 tons and is 36 feet wide with a 14foot 
draft 
the depth did us in lynn said we dont have that much in 
the river 
the williamsburg also isnt seaworthy and probably wouldnt fit 
under many river bridges 
nielsen estimated that even though the ship would be donated 
the restoration would cost about 7 million more if the ship is 
to ever sail again 
nielsen said to build a ship its size from scratch today would 
cost somewhere between 12 million and 20 million and the 
williamsburg could be eligible for federal funds if it were to be 
named a national landmark 
dan mcgraw of independence looked into bringing the yacht to 
independence about four years ago when he finally tracked it down 
it was privately owned and scheduled to again become a floating 
restaurant in new jersey the city of independence dropped its 
queries 
then nielsen called mcgraw two weeks ago to say the ship was 
available 
but now mcgraw said i dont think the citys going to get 
involved in it i dont know what the city of independence would do 
with it

the legal showdown in the southeastern mail bombs 
case will pit the man who prosecuted new yorks pizza 
connection drug case against a pair of ponytailed lawyers known 
for defending controversial clients 
added to that mix is outspoken us district judge richard 
freeman and a crime that has held the southeasts attention for 
nearly a year 
walter leroy moody jr of rex ga is accused of mailing bombs 
to a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer last december killing 
both 
defending him are atlanta lawyers bruce harvey and michael 
hauptman both associated with the american civil liberties union 
but acting in this case as courtappointed attorneys 
each wears a diamond earring and graying hair pulled back in a 
ponytail 
hauptman appeared on geraldo riveras television talk show this 
year discussing his marriage to dolores french author of 
working my life as a prostitute 
prosecuting the case is assistant us attorney louis freeh who 
handled the 1987 pizza connection drug case in new york 
youve got three great lawyers said robert fogelnest a new 
york lawyer familiar with all of them 
freeh he said is as tough as they come the defense 
lawyers are courageous and not afraid to take on unpopular 
cases 
moody was named in a 70count indictment last week after an 
11month investigation of the mail bomb killings of us circuit 
judge robert vance in alabama and attorney robert robinson in 
georgia 
if convicted on all 70 counts moody could be sentenced to seven 
life terms plus 385 years in prison and fines of 169 million 
no trial date has been set 
in the first of a number of expected pretrial motions moodys 
lawyers last week asked that every federal judge in the united 
states be barred from the case claiming no such judge could be 
impartial 
that motion is pending 
each defense lawyer has taken several controversial cases 
among harveys past clients are convicted columbus ga 
stocking strangler carlton gary and jerome bowden a convicted 
murderer whose 1986 execution continued the debate over whether 
capital punishment should apply to the mentally retarded 
hauptman president of the georgia aclu recently successfully 
challenged the states mask law on behalf of a member of the ku 
klux klan the law had banned klan members from wearing masks in 
public he also has represented many capital murder defendants 
although deadly serious in the courtroom they display a wry 
sense of humor outside 
after seeking to bar federal judges from the case harvey was 
asked where if the motion succeeds the case might end up 
hopefully somewhere near a beach he replied 
freeh known as lowkey but extremely tough prosecuted the 
17monthlong heroin importing case dubbed the pizza connection 
because participants allegedly used pizza parlors as fronts 
in that case salvatore catalano a reputed former chief of the 
sicilian mafia was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison 
freeman an outspoken judge who tightly controls his court 
earlier this year criticized the fbi for leaking details of the 
investigation saying moodys right to a fair trial was risked by 
some loudmouthed agent 
however he may excuse himself from the trial 
the chance of an atlanta judge trying this case is small 
said atlanta attorney james k jenkins you have a collegiality 
among judges in a circuit that have relationships that would make 
any judge look at it excusing himself seriously

emperor akihito ascended to the worlds oldest 
hereditary monarchy today the first in a legendary 2600yearold 
line of emperors to be enthroned as a national symbol rather than a 
living god 
leftist extremists who consider the institution of emperor an 
unconstitutional relic of japans militarist past attacked 
military bases train stations and shinto shrines in protest 
police counted at least 34 guerrilla attacks timed to coincide 
with the coronation of the late emperor hirohitos 56yearold son 
none appeared to cause any injuries 
a record 37000 police had been mobilized to guard the 
ceremonies as well as the attending dignitaries from 158 countries 
including vice president dan quayle and britains prince charles 
and princess diana 
for his coronation akihito wore a redbrown silk kimono and hat 
of ancient design and sat on an elaborate lacquered throne in front 
of an imperial palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying 
bows and swords 
he vowed to discharge my duties as symbol of the state and of 
the unity of the people under japans postwar constitution which 
fundamentally restructured the monarchy 
hirohito had renounced his divine status after the war but 
akihito becomes the first of japans 125 emperors including those 
listed only in legend to take the throne as a mere mortal and not 
a priestking 
he said he would perform his role in the same spirit as his 
father who shared joys and sorrows with the people at all 
times during a 62year reign that encompassed both the 
devastation of world war ii and japans dramatic recovery 
empress michiko dressed in a multicolored gown her face 
painted white sat motionless on her own throne at akihitos side 
throughout the 30minute ceremony 
the ritual ended with prime minister toshiki kaifu standing 
stiffly before akihito in a morning suit and leading the japanese 
guests in three cries of banzai he traditional wish for long 
life 
he led the cheers from a point level with the base of the 
throne to underscore the constitutions stress on popular 
sovereignty 
a 21gun salute blasted from an adjacent park 
the ancient mystical enthronement rites are said to date back 
to 660 bc 
akihito and empress michiko later left the palace grounds in an 
open rolls royce ringed by dozens of police motorcycles and waving 
and smiling to cheering crowds they had changed to formal western 
clothes 
many of the estimated 110000 people along the threemile parade 
route to akasaka palace the couples home yelled banzai and 
waved national flags as the 44car parade passed nearly 10000 
police lined the route 
there was one shaky moment however when firecrackers popped as 
the emperors car passed by police with german shepherds rushed in 
and arrested several people some of whom handed out leaflets 
calling hirohito a war criminal 
leftist radicals who want the imperial house abolished made 
themselves heard all across the capital police said they arrested 
about a dozen of the several thousand protesters who held 
antiimperial rallies around tokyo 
in one park hundreds of masked members of the ultraleftist 
chukakuha or middle core faction chanted smash the enthronement 
ceremony 
one man attempted to commit harakiri or traditional suicide by 
disembowelment in front of the imperial palace but was rushed to a 
hospital police said there were no immediate details on his 
condition or motivation 
radicals launched projectiles at three suburban military bases 
and a fourth in western tokyo the defense agency reported police 
reported another attack outside the us naval base at atsugi 24 
miles southwest of tokyo 
radicals also were accused of setting early morning fires at 
three tokyo train stations that stopped traffic on two major 
commuter lines police reported 
fires erupted at four shinto shrines in tokyo including one 
less than a mile from akihitos residence destroying two 
japanese flags lined the main streets in the ginza shopping 
district where cars and trucks painted with rightist slogans 
paraded speakers blared long live the emperor as riot police 
stood by 
but many japanese were ignoring the ceremonies taking advantage 
of the special holiday to take weekend trips and crowd golf courses 
and driving ranges long lines of people queued in front of movie 
theaters 
one poll indicated nearly half of the japanese were not 
interested in the enthronement 
akihito became emperor immediately after the death of hirohito 
in january 1989 but his enthronement was delayed until after a 
period of mourning

the government of chad says its troops have beaten 
back an attack by libyansupported mercenaries who crossed the 
border from sudan 
the invaders were repelled after 24 hours of violent combat 
in the tine region of eastern chad said a communique issued late 
sunday by chads embassy in paris 
chad said the offensive was launched saturday by the islamic 
legion which it described as a force of 2000 mercenaries equipped 
with armored vehicles and supported by libya and sudan 
both those countries subsequently denied any role in the 
fighting saying that only chadian dissidents were involved 
the chadian communique made no mention of casualties but said 
the attackers retreated in disarray toward their base in the 
sudanese province of darfour 
libya and chad fought a war in the early 1980s and have since 
engaged in sporadic negotiations over their disputed border the 
most recent round of talks were held last month

emperor akihito has long lived in the shadow of his 
father the late emperor hirohito and the memories of japans 
headlong march into the pacific war that hirohitos name evoked 
but now that akihito has assumed the throne left by his fathers 
death many japanese are looking to him as the symbol of a new age 
that of the generation who experienced war as children and 
rebuilt the nation in peace 
akihito was 11 at the end of world war ii which japanese 
militarists had urged the nation into in the name of his father 
the impact of surrender and reform under the guidance of 
usled occupation forces deeply affected his youth 
before akihito turned 13 hirohito made his historic 
renunciation of imperial divinity 
occupation troops departed japan in 1952 leaving behind them a 
democratic constitution that renounced war and defined japans 
monarchs as symbols not the priestkings of bygone days 
that imperial role seems to fit akihito who in one of his first 
duties after assuming the throne upon the death of hirohito in 
january 1989 promised to uphold the constitution along with the 
people 
akihito born dec 23 1933 bears a strong physical resemblance 
to hirohito and has inherited his fathers short almost frail 
build he also has his fathers passion for science and is a 
respected scholar in the study of gobies a type of mudsucking 
fish 
akihito speaks fluent english and is japans most widely 
traveled emperor he has made official visits to 37 countries his 
first to england for the coronation of queen elizabeth ii in 1953 
reflecting the circumstances of his upbringing akihito is often 
described by former schoolmates and palace officials as a more 
democraticallyminded warmer person than the quiet reclusive 
hirohito 
he has also been far more prone to set his own precedents 
just three years after completing his education akihito was 
the first emperor schooled alongside commoners the royal heir 
chose a commoner for his bride making another break from the past 
the woman michiko shoda was the daughter of one of the 
nations wealthiest businessmen but their marriage in 1959 sent 
shock waves through japans former nobility 
to the rest of the nation however the wedding was welcomed as 
none before about 500000 people lined the streets for a chance to 
see akihito and michiko in their horsedrawn carriage during a 
parade after the ceremony 
the royal couple again broke with tradition by raising their own 
children a decision prompted in part by akihitos desire to have 
the family life he was denied as a child according to minoru 
hamao a former imperial chamberlain 
taken away from his parents at an early age to be raised by 
strangers akihito at times complained of the loneliness he felt 
when his classmates would talk to him about their homes said 
hamao who served akihito for two decades 
akihitos first child and heir crown prince naruhito was born 
feb 23 1960 they have another son prince akishino and 
daughter princess nori 
though the crown prince remains single prince akishino earlier 
this year wed kiko kawashima who like the empress had no royal 
lineage

huge lines formed at gasoline 
stations throughout the city today as a government plan went into 
effect to limit sales and save fuel in the wake of the persian gulf 
crisis 
industry officials warned that the panicbuying was dangerously 
depleting gasoline supplies 
industry and congressional sources criticized the government 
plan and complained that president corazon aquinos administration 
had failed to consult the private sector they also criticized the 
government for failing to inform the public on details of the 
fuelsaving plan 
the philippines imports all its oil and about 85 percent comes 
from the middle east 
station owners said panicbuying began sunday one day before 
the start of government restrictions on hours of operation many 
stations closed early sunday claiming they had run out of 
supplies 
others limited customers to purchases of 450 enough for a 
quarter tank in midsized cars 
last week the energy regulatory board ordered stations to 
operate only between 7 am and 7 pm during work days and to 
close at 5 pm on sundays 
on friday mrs aquino also ordered the three national oil 
companies to curb sales by 10 percent as part of the conservation 
plan under the order service stations will only receive supplies 
every 10 days 
pedro lobos vice president of the philippine petroleum dealers 
association said that if panicbuying continues the 10day 
supplies will be gone in two or three days 
lobos urged the government to suspend the 10 percent reduction 
order to allow time to devise a workable conservation plan 
long lines extended from the stations out into major streets 
clogging traffic during the morning rush hour 
presidential executive secretary catalino macaraig said there 
was no cause for panicbuying 
i dont know about it but i will look into it he said 
maybe this was brought about by the price increase being 
predicted in the media 
mrs aquino was out of the country today she had left sunday 
for japan to attend the enthronement of emperor akihito despite a 
selfimposed ban on foreign travel because of the countrys 
economic and political problems 
before leaving she ordered the cabinet security committee to 
meet today to discuss contingency plans for saving fuel 
if we dont discipline ourselves then we cannot prolong our 
present inventory of oil said the committees chairman justice 
secretary franklin drilon 
the countrys fuel crisis was brought about by the steep decline 
in dollar reserves because of the depreciation of the philippine 
peso 
that was caused in part by a decline in convertible currency 
coming into the country after thousands of filipinos lost their 
jobs in kuwait after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
transportation secretary oscar orbos said the government was 
considering other conservation measures including rationing fuel 
and banning private cars during certain hours 
the energy regulatory board said last month that the country had 
enough oil reserves for 59 days the board said the normal reserve 
was 70 days

a kitten survived the hairraising 
experience of being sucked up by the 175 mph force of a vacuum hose 
on a leafcollector truck 
instead of being cut by the machinery the homeless 
orangeandwhite kitten landed safely in a pile of leaves inside 
the collection bin friday 
usually anything that goes in there is pretty much history 
said robert taylor of the highway department 
workers who realized the machine had sucked up a kitten and 
petrified that they might have killed someones beloved pet 
decided to see how the animal had fared 
they dug about 4 feet into the collection bin and saw nothing 
then they dumped the leaves out and carefully poked around with a 
rake expecting to see a ghastly sight they were relieved to find 
the kitten unharmed but visibly shaken 
it looked like one of those halloween cats with its hair 
standing straight up taylor said it was so scared but we 
couldnt believe he was alive 
the kittens owners couldnt be found so charles and lucia 
klemovich agreed to take it in 
to distinguish the little one from their three other cats 
scratch itch and blacky the klemovichs gave the kitten what they 
believed is a wellearned name hoover

seven blacks died in violence 
near johannesburg and thousands of black workers in the capital 
pretoria stayed home today to protest electricity cutoffs in the 
townships outside the city 
police said five men were killed in katlehong a township 
southeast of johannesburg that has been wracked by black factional 
fighting for several months 
a police spokeswoman lt ida van zweel said the battle with 
guns and knives was between xhosa and zulu tribal members at a 
squatter camp on the edge of the township 
also a man was hacked to death and set on fire in sebokeng 
south of johannesburg in jouberton southwest of the city a youth 
died when police fired on a group throwing gasoline bombs at a 
policemans house the police unrest report gave no additional 
details 
meanwhile most black workers in pretoria took part in a oneday 
stayaway organized by antiapartheid groups aligned with the 
african national congress the leading black opposition group 
there were few blacks on the streets and shops that employ 
blacks had to rely on their white staff 
the stayaway was called to protest power cuts in the neighboring 
townships authorities shut off electricity last week because 
residents were not paying their bills in a protest against poor 
living conditions 
residents and police clashed saturday in the atteridgeville 
township leaving two dead and 18 injured the government on sunday 
imposed a 9 pm to 4 am curfew and gave police expanded powers 
in atteridgeville and nearby saulsville 
organizers said todays stayaway also was meant to express 
opposition to the government in the nearby black homeland of 
bophuthatswana 
activists see the tribal territories as part of the apartheid 
system of racial segregation and have called for the four homelands 
with nominal independence to be reincorporated into south africa 
the president of bophuthatswana lucas mangope has refused to 
consider rejoining south africa despite mounting opposition to his 
rule todays stayaway also affected businesses in bophuthatswana 
police in bophuthatswana said today they had detained an 
unspecified number of anc supporters allegedly plotting to kill 
mangope and overthrow the homeland government 
the arrest and detention of anc members and other activists 
is but one more example of an unpopular regime trying to 
postpone its demise by repression the anc said in a statement 
in the three other independent homelands transkei ciskei 
and venda army members have staged coups in recent years and 
developed good relations with the anc 
anc leader nelson mandela told a rally in venda on sunday that 
the anc and the homelands should forget about past differences 
and unite 
the anc has decided to call upon homeland leaders to rally 
behind it mandela told some 20000 blacks at a sports stadium 
he appeared with vendas military ruler brig gabriel ramushwana

mayor david dinkins told fellow bigcity mayors 
that urban areas deserve federal funds in exchange for supplying a 
labor force and tax revenues 
dinkins and 33 other mayors who met here sunday to discuss the 
survival of their cities said federal tax revenues generated by in 
them help fuel the nations economic growth 
cities are our nations marketplaces not only for business 
but also for ideas dinkins said if we choke off our cities by 
denying them the resources they need to function efficiently the 
marketplaces will disappear 
the mayoral summit meeting which continues through tuesday 
is focusing on urban issues such as combating drug abuse improving 
education and paying for costly building projects such as bridges 
and roads 
atlanta mayor maynard jackson said property taxes alone wont 
pay the bills for solving such problems 
many of the mayors speaking sunday most of them democrats said 
the federal government was neglecting urban areas for instance in 
1980 federal funds made up 194 percent of new york citys budget 
currently that share is 97 percent dinkins said 
dinkins just last week announced that he had to cut 5400 city 
jobs to close a 388 million municipal budget gap 
boston mayor raymond flynn complained that cities arent getting 
enough federal aid to support drug education 
the mayors also got a look at a survey prepared for the urban 
summit that showed many nonurban americans support efforts to help 
cities 
the survey found that 74 percent of those living outside cities 
would be willing to pay higher taxes to provide housing for the 
poor 71 percent of nonurban residents would be willing to pay 
higher taxes for aids treatment programs 66 percent would be 
willing to pay higher taxes for better urban public schools and 63 
percent would be willing to pay higher taxes for drug 
rehabilitation programs in cities 
the survey of a random sample of 1199 americans made during 
early october was done by the city university of new yorks office 
of urban affairs it had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percent

boris yeltsin the outspoken president of the 
russian federation today accused rival mikhail s gorbachev of 
trying to pressure his republic into ceding some economic powers to 
the central government 
but we couldnt and will not go for that yeltsin told a 
legislative committee 
yeltsin and gorbachev the two most powerful soviet politicians 
and frequent critics of each others policies met in the kremlin 
on sunday for four hours of what were intended as peacemaking 
talks 
but yeltsin came out with more criticism of soviet authorities 
especially over negotiations on a new treaty to group the 15 
splintering soviet republics 
they pressed us yesterday and earlier to first sign a union 
treaty and then resolve remaining issues in the meantime 
transferring everything to the authority of the center yeltsin 
told the russian federations constitutional commission his 
remarks were carried by the independent interfax news agency 
yeltsin did not use gorbachevs name but the soviet president 
appeared to be his target in the end an agreement was reached to 
resolve differences this year before the treaty is signed yeltsin 
told the commission 
soviet authorities and russian authorities will form parallel 
groups to work on issues interfax said included banking property 
and the money supply 
yeltsin also listed disputes over control of oil gas gold and 
other precious metals as among the issues the committees would try 
to resolve the official news agency tass reported 
the russian federation and most other republics are at odds with 
the central soviet government over who should control what the 
russian parliament has declared its laws take precedence over 
national legislation and has passed a plan for switching to a 
market economy in 500 days 
earlier today the prime minister of russia said he told soviet 
prime minister nikolai ryzhkov his republic wants to help 
strengthen the union but also wants more powers itself 
we understand this mission and intend to implement it 
strengthening the union but on new principles of economic 
cooperation on principles of political interaction as a sovereign 
state in the union of soviet socialist republics russian prime 
minister ivan silaev told defense plant managers gathered in the 
russian federations government headquarters 
silaev and ryzhkov joined in the kremlin session after yeltsin 
and gorbachev met alone 
the popular yeltsin whom gorbachev ousted from the communist 
party politburo in 1988 has criticized the soviet leader for not 
moving fast enough on reforms

the largest guerrilla group fighting the 
government has invited the countrys principal prodemocracy party 
to form a provisional government in rebelheld areas an insurgent 
leader said today 
tin maung win general secretary of the democratic alliance of 
burma rebel group spoke on the eve of a meeting between his group 
and members of the national league for democracy the nations 
leading prodemocracy party 
there was no immediate response from the league to the offer 
the government has no intention of transferring power and 
continues to suppress any moves toward democracy and so we have an 
obligation to the burmese people to take a definite course of 
action tin maung win said 
the league easily won general elections in may but the ruling 
military junta has refused to relinquish power instead the party 
has been crippled in recent months by arrests of its leaders and 
organizers 
last month the government arrested four of the few remaining 
league central committee members and raided the partys offices 
nationwide 
the military also has moved against dissidents among the 
buddhist clergy raiding monasteries and arresting monks 
tin maung win said the league had been invited to form a 
national coalition government with the democratic alliance of 
burma he spoke at the rebel stronghold of manerplaw along the 
thaiburmese border 
the manerplawbased alliance is the largest rebel group fighting 
the rangoon government it consists of 22 ethnic minority and 
dissident groups and controls about onethird of the country 
mostly areas bordering thailand bangladesh and china 
tin maung win said there was fear that the ruling state law and 
order restoration council would outlaw the league and it therefore 
was being offered sanctuary in the liberated zone 
the league cannot function in rangoon any more let alone form 
a government he told reporters 
tin maung win said the new government would be temporary 
until the league can stand on its own two feet and declare a 
legitimate government in rangoon 
it was not known how many league members had fled to manerplaw 
or other rebelheld areas but there have been scattered reports of 
both party members and monks fleeing the cities to avoid arrest 
a dozen ethnic minority groups have waged a long bloody war 
against the central government demanding more autonomy since 
1988 they have been joined by students and others fleeing 
repression in the interior 
the military violently crushed a nationwide prodemocracy 
movement in september 1988 one of the major figures of that 
movement and a league leader aung san suu kyi has been under 
house arrest in rangoon since july 1989 
last week the londonbased amnesty international said it had 
reports of widespread torture of political detainees in burma a 
team of un human rights investigators left burma on sunday but 
rangoonbased diplomats said the military had severely restricted 
activities of the team

through a long history of revolt and protest 
france has seen nothing like it 
day after day students in the tens of thousands march 
arminarm through french cities praised by teachers and parents 
demanding the government make their schools safer and better 
in 1968 brigades of leftist university students fought with 
riot police in paris displaying contempt for all aspects of 
authority 
this fall teenagers campaign peacefully for a fair chance to 
join the establishment their leaders confer with police commanders 
to negate the impact of troublemakers exploiting the protests 
marches and rallies began more than three weeks ago and 
intensified in the past week with daily protests across france 
today in their biggest protest yet tens of thousands of high 
school students many from distant cities marched through paris 
with hundreds of supporters 
the students goals seem so reasonable that even pillars of the 
establishment are helping out officials of the national railroad 
persuaded in part by student blockades of railway tracks offered 
60 percent fare discounts on special trains to paris for todays 
protest 
at least two local politicians in the distant cities of 
grenoble on the edge of the alps and pau near the spanish border 
arranged travel for protesters from their cities 
the students assembled at the place de la bastille where 
revolutionaries stormed the bastille prison 201 years ago and 
marched toward the champs elysees 
minimal violence has accompanied the protests youths described 
by student leaders as provocateurs have hurled stones at police and 
smashed store windows on a few occasions 
many sidewalk cafes along the march route were closed as a 
precaution and police said two youths were arrested after some 
street vendors were robbed 
pierre verbrugghe the paris police chief had ordered his 
officers to avoid confrontation today prompting allegations from 
police unions that he was turning the force into mere 
bystanders 
today scores of offduty members of a major police union 
wearing civilian clothes joined student leaders at the head of the 
march and offered to assist in any negotiations with uniformed 
police 
several major associations of teachers and parents have endorsed 
the student goals teachers unions plan to send representatives to 
the march 
weve accepted an invitation from the students said yannick 
simbron secretarygeneral of the federation of national education 
one of the unions the problems they are raising are those weve 
been raising for a long time 
surprising unity has developed between the two main student 
factions one led by hardline leftists and the other aligned with 
an antiracism group they decided to march together today rather 
than form two processions 
the protests began with student strikes in the gritty northern 
suburbs of paris after the gang rape of a girl in a school lavatory 
and assaults on several teachers protesters complained of drug 
trafficking theft and extortion at schools 
were totally left to ourselves its the law of the jungle 
a 16yearold protester from versailles told the magazine 
levenement 
protesters want more government spending to improve security 
replace substandard facilities modernize curriculums and hire more 
teachers many high schools have more than 35 students per class 
in negotiations with education minister lionel jospin student 
leaders also have demanded greater freedom of expression and 
assembly 
jospin says the protesters gradually are complying with his 
request to be more specific in their demands on thursday he 
promised to push for a swift reassessment of high school education 
and said the students naturally must be heard and included in 
these discussions 
most protesters come from relatively lowincome families and 
many are children of immigrants they view education as the key to 
advancement and resent a seemingly secondclass treatment of 
schools in the highrise slums that ring many major cities 
the government has proposed increasing the education budget by 9 
percent in 1991 which would outpace an overall budget rise of 43 
percent and mark the first time education has been given more money 
than defense 
students worry that improvements wont come quickly enough to 
help them win university admission or decent jobs 
their protests have posed a dilemma for the governing socialist 
party and particularly for president francois mitterrand who has 
enjoyed strong support among youth since taking office in 1981 
mitterrand has stayed on the sidelines but faces increasing 
pressure to intervene or risk alienating his young supporters 
what have we done in 10 years with the immense hope the 
election of francois mitterrand raised asked jean poperen a 
socialist leader we havent changed this society enough and it 
is in the process of taking revenge

iraq has said it might attend a proposed arab summit aimed at 
avoiding war in the persian gulf but only if the meeting also 
deals with the arabisraeli dispute 
king hassan of morocco proposed the emergency summit on sunday 
as a last chance for peace 
there were new signs meanwhile of cracks in the alliance 
against iraq egypts president hosni mubarak was quoted today as 
saying that egyptian soldiers will not enter iraq even if us and 
other troops attack 
he said his troops could however enter kuwait as a 
peacekeeping force 
at the same time the european community said it would urge 
baghdad to accept a unbrokered solution concerning the hundreds 
of westerners held by iraq the ec wants countries negotiating 
hostage deals with iraq to work together and thereby prevent 
tensions among nations in the antiiraq alliance 
meanwhile an arab summit attended by iraq appeared possible 
on sunday iraqs ruling revolutionary command council said iraq 
would attend the summit under three conditions those were that 
baghdad be consulted in advance on the agenda that the timing and 
location be chosen so saddam could attend and that the agenda 
include not just the gulf crisis but all middle east issues 
including the palestinian question 
the council led by iraqi president saddam hussein also 
suggested it would not allow certain topics to be discussed it did 
not specify which ones 
the proposed summit should not be part of efforts to prepare 
the political theater as a cover for american aggression against 
iraq and the arab nation the statement said 
in tunis the palestine liberation organization issued a 
statement saying it agreed with king hassans initiaive 
saddam has long demanded that a solution to the crisis be linked 
to the palestinian issue he made the offer shortly after his aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
king hassan suggested that the summit be held in rabat the 
morrocan capital in a week but he said he would attend a summit 
wherever it might be held 
morocco outspoken among arab nations in condemning the iraqi 
invasion has committed more than 1200 soldiers to the usled 
multinational force based in saudi arabia 
in an interview with british television saddam again urged 
dialogue on the crisis and said he did not believe the world was 
united against him 
the major powers and a number of countries are lined up 
against baghdad saddam acknowledged but to say that the world 
is unified against iraq is indeed not a correct thing to say 
in the statements of the us and britain they themselves are 
voicing their concern that the unity socalled unity against iraq 
is perhaps suffering from a split saddam said 
secretary of state james a baker iii received assurances from 
key allies last week that they will accept nothing short of an 
unconditional iraqi pullout 
however officials said china france and the soviet union 
reportedly expressed concern that washington might attack iraqi 
forces without giving the unordered trade embargo enough of a 
chance 
there were also signs of cracks in the arab alliance against 
iraq when baker visited cairo last week a senior us official 
said the united states is confident that egypt would fight 
alongside us forces if war broke out 
but asked by his partys newspaper mayo whether egypt would 
send troops to iraq following a usled attack mubarak said 
no we have nothing to do with iraq but if the antiiraq 
allies invaded kuwait he said we do not mind at all entering 
kuwait as peacekeeping forces although i do not hope for this 
day at all 
in washington the powerful chairman of the senate armed 
services committee said the bush administration must have the 
support of the american people if the nation is to go to war with 
iraq 
the last thing we need is to have a war over there a bloody 
war and have american boys being sent and brought back in body 
bags and yet not have the american people behind them said sen 
sam nunn dga weve gone that route one time we dont need to 
do it again 
in brussels meanwhile european community foreign ministers 
said they would step up pressure on iraq to open talks with a un 
envoy on the fate of hundreds of westerners that baghdad is 
holding they said they would encourage about 40 nations to 
pressure sadam into accepting mediation by such an envoy 
in other developments 
foreign minister qian qichen of china met today with saddam in 
baghdad a chinese diplomat said talks focused on how to achieve a 
peaceful solution to the gulf crisis 
in tokyo foreign leaders gathered for emperor akihitos 
enthronement were pessimistic about a peaceful solution to the gulf 
crisis an aide to vice president dan quayle said on condition of 
anonymity

value of 300 million for struggling pan am 
icahn said in a telephone interview that pan am chairman thomas 
plaskett had asked him to make an offer in case pan ams talks with 
ual corp fail pan am has proposed selling ual important routes 
between new york and london as part of a 400 million deal 
although twa is considered healthier than pan am both have been 
hurt by rising fuel prices since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
and fewer passengers since the economy started weakening

heathrow airport would be sold pan am said twa and pan am are the 
only two us airlines flying into heathrow

the governing party today claimed 
overwhelming victories in two major state elections that tested the 
impact of reforms in the country and the longdominant party 
itself 
but the opposition charged that the institutional revolutionary 
party or pri resorted to oldfashioned fraud during sundays vote 
for state and local officials in hidalgo and mexico states 
unofficial results from party poll watchers continued to trickle 
in today but official results by law will not be released for a 
week 
pri has been scrambling to renovate itself since the 1988 
elections when president carlos salinas de gortari won election 
with the narrowest margin in modern mexican history 
salinas has pushed the country to sudden freemarket reforms 
that have jolted the longsluggish economy he has overseen a new 
election law and party reforms billed as more democratic 
the reforms included state primary elections to choose local 
candidates doing away with the appointment of candidates by party 
leaders 
pri officials said they appeared to be even or ahead in all of 
the 121 municipalities of mexico state they also claimed victory 
in the 22 local hidalgo races they said were decided 
but the conservative national action party claimed it was 
leading in at least some parts of mexico state 
the leftist party of the democratic revolution said it had won 
at least one victory in hidalgo and had been robbed of others 
it was a normal election within the common and ongoing 
frauds but normal said francisco ortiz mendoza an election 
official of the popular socialist party he was quoted by the 
excelsior news agency 
the state of mexico is the countrys most populous with more 
than 10 million people and 45 million voters it borders mexico 
city but does not include it 
hidalgo just northeast of mexico state is a mountainous zone 
with a few sizable cities and many small villages 
reporters touring mexico state on sunday found polling places 
generally orderly and peaceful and often empty party estimates of 
turnout hovered around 30 percent 
the election commission in mexico state said it had received 
complaints of irregularities in only 84 voting places 23 percent 
of the total 
javier paz zarza spokesman for the national action party in 
mexico state alleged that armed men also seized ballot boxes in 
chimalhuacan 
in hidalgo state pri spokesman marco antonio gonzalez said the 
party was leading in the 22 results so far available the state has

israeli leaders have agreed to hold talks with 
a un envoy as a compromise with a security council demand for an 
investigation into last months temple mount killings israel radio 
said today 
the radio quoted foreign minister david levy as announcing the 
decision during a closeddoor session of parliaments foreign 
affairs and defense committee 
the ministry declined official comment on the report but a 
government official confirmed israel had worked out an 
understanding with the united states to accept the compromise he 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the proposal called for a special un envoy to visit israel but 
not in connection with two security council resolutions censuring 
israel and demanding a probe the official said 
the compromise was aimed at hading off threats by the un 
security council to take further measures against israel earlier 
the council criticized excessive force by police in the oct 8 
riots on the temple mount 
twenty palestinians were killed and more than 140 wounded when 
police opened fire on arab stonethrowers at the site which is 
holy to both moslems and jews 
the united states which refused to use its veto to block a 
resolution condemning israel for the shootings has been pushing 
israel to accept a un investigation into the slayings 
israel rejected such a probe saying it could call into question 
its sovereignty over east jerusalem which it captured from jordan 
in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed 
most western countries do not recognize israeli rule of the 
eastern sector where the temple mount is located 
levys reported statement came after a possible compromise was 
discussed at sundays weekly cabinet meeting but no decision was 
announced 
the radio quoted levy as saying today that israel would accept a 
un envoy in a compromise with the united states 
the official said israeli leaders would meet with jean claude 
aimee an envoy of un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
who visited israel in june to discuss the palestinian issue 
the official stressed that an understanding rather than a 
formal agreement was reached with washington he said israel was 
still waiting to hear if perez de cuellar had accepted the 
compromise 
we do hope that on their side the american administration will 
now work to remove the subject from the security council agenda 
the official said 
an israeli daily newspaper reported meanwhile that president 
bush warned american jewish leaders last week to stop objecting to 
weapons sales to saudi arabia or he would tell the american people 
who is with us and who is against us 
the yedioth ahronoth said bush spoke out of concern that jewish 
opposition to his proposal to sell the saudis 20 billion worth of 
equipment and weapons could harm the multinational alliance in the 
persian gulf 
the comments were contained in a report compiled by israels 
ambassador to washington zalman shoval a copy of which was placed 
on prime minister yitzhak shamirs desk sunday the newspaper said 
israel has traditionally been outspoken in opposing american 
arms shipments to enemy arab states but has kept quiet over the 
latest proposed sale because of the gulf crisis

the party of yugoslavias reformist 
premier ante markovic held a slight lead over ruling communists 
in unofficial returns from free elections in the macedonian 
republic officials said today 
an official of the state electoral commission speaking on 
condition of anonymity said initial figures put markovics party 
just ahead of the communists in sundays voting he said he could 
not provide specific figures 
stojan andov the head of the alliance of reformist forces in 
macedonia also said the party was doing well andov himself won a 
seat from the capital skopje an aide said 
the alliance advocates market economics and keeping yugoslavia 
united 
the polling in the southern republic yugoslavias poorest was 
viewed as a crucial test for markovic whose party was competing in 
an election for the first time 
a good showing in the ballot in macedonia would significantly 
boost the partys chances in elections in the states of 
bosniahercegovina montenegro and serbia in the next weeks 
markovics popularity grew steadily after he became federal 
premier in march 1989 but his reforms and efforts to keep together 
yugoslavias fragile federation of six republics have been 
undermined by political squabbling and increasing ethnic tensions 
official results were not expected until thursday runoff 
elections will be held nov 25 in districts where no one received 
50 percent of the vote 
turnout was estimated at 75 percent of the 137 million eligible 
voters 
petar gosev the head of the former communist party recently 
renamed the party of democratic change was reported by skopje 
television to have won a majority in his skopje district 
gosev strongly supports markovics policies and has said he 
would be prepared to form a coalition with markovics party 
a coalition of nationalist rightwing parties charged that 
there had been widespread electoral fraud during sundays voting 
and demanded it be declared invalid public opinion polls had 
indicated that the four parties that make up the coalition were 
likely to do poorly in the balloting 
another contender in the elections was the mainly ethnic 
albanian party of democratic prosperity people of albanian origin 
account for more than 20 percent of macedonias population of 22 
million

a conservative bornagain christian 
jumped to an early lead in guatemalas presidential election today 
but it appeared that the contest would have to be decided by a 
runoff in january 
jorge serrano elias 45 whose resume ranges from close 
collaboration with one of guatemalas last dictators to a stint on 
a national commission promoting democracy and peace talks with 
leftist rebels led with 2809 percent of the vote with about 21 
percent of the total counted 
if none of the 12 candidates gets more than 50 percent of the 
vote there will be a runoff jan 6 it would be the first time in 
guatemalas history that one elected civilian has taken office from 
another 
results broadcast by the supreme electoral tribunal gave 
newspaper publisher jorge carpio nicolle 2317 percent of the vote 
and former guatemala mayor alvaro arzu irigoyen 2237 percent 
the candidate of the incumbent christian democrats alfonso 
cabrera had 1368 percent the other candidates shared the other 
12 percent 
the winner will inherit a 30yearold civil war a bankrupt 
government 60 percent inflation and an epidemic of street crime 
and human rights abuse 
the trend in sundays balloting represents a sharp repudiation 
of the corrupt and inept christian democractic administration of 
president vinicio cerezo who was barred by the constitution from 
running for reelection 
election officials say the turnout appears to be about 60 
percent of 33 million registered voters 
that would be less than in 1985 but more than some observers had 
predicted 
guatemalans also were electing a vice president 116 members of 
a new congress 20 delegates to a new central american parliament 
and 300 mayors 
carpio who has been campaigning for years positioned himself 
as the centrist and assembled a broad coalition ranging from an 
archright running mate to disaffected socialists 
arzu 44 campaigned as a nononsense pragmatist who would run 
guatemala like a business enterprise 
he headed the national tourism agency at a time when guatemala 
was facing international censure because of its human rights 
record 
as mayor he gained high marks for public works projects he is 
from a wealthy old guatemalan family and had the backing of some of 
the most conservative elements of the private sector 
serrano a 45yearold engineer came in third in the 1985 
presidential election and polls had suggested he would fare no 
better this time 
but his old boss retired gen efrain rios montt was forced to 
withdraw due to laws banning former coup instigators from running 
for election that threw an important chunk of votes from the 
religious right into serranos lap 
rios montt is an evangelical preacher who presided over some of 
the worst human rights abuses in guatemalas bloody history until 
he was deposed in 1983 
he had stormed to the head of the crowded field this year on a 
tough lawandorder platform that hit a hugely responsive chord in 
nation bowed by crime and government corruption 
a televised debate with cerezo also gave serrano a boost in 
capital political observers say cerezo debated on behalf of his 
party by law presidents here serve one fiveyear term 
serrano headed rios montts advisory council in 1982 and 1983 
and helped draft a set of electoral laws his campaign literature 
says the job showed serranos faith in democracy 
after the rios montt years serrano went on to carve out his 
own more mainstream niche he was an important member of the 
national reconciliation commission created to work toward 
implementing the 1987 central american accords on regional peace 
and democratization 
the campaign was long and marred by violence and rumors of 
coups but election day was calm 
the federal human rights ombudsman who has logged 264 killings 
and 176 disappearances this year said the the country was 
totally normal without violence or significant reports of 
electoral problems 
five years of democracy has done little to improve everday life 
in guatemala and the challenges that will face the winner are 
immense 
seven out of every 10 guatemalans live in dire poverty and half 
cannot read or write 
the new president also will have to contend with an immensely 
powerful military and one of the most conservative private sectors 
in the hemisphere 
on the bright side peace talks have recently begun in the 
30yearold civil war that has left 100000 dead and more than 
40000 missing almost all at the hands of the military or 
rightwing death squads 
the election season brought an outbreak of assassinations 
disappearances and death threats that put guatemala back on the 
international human rights agenda 
it has been an embarrassment for the united states which helped 
provoke 30 years of brutal dictatorship and civil war with leftist 
rebels by backing a military coup against a liberal civilian 
government in 1954 
the united states has poured nearly 1 billion in aid into 
guatemala since civilian rule was restored in 1985 hoping to 
create a showcase for freemarket democracy

thousands of celebrants filled the 
streets of this african country on monday for the crowning of the 
new king of lesotho 
formerly known as prince mohato the new king is the 27yearold 
son of exiled king moshoeshoe ii who was dethroned last week by 
the head of the countrys ruling military council maj gen justin 
lekhanya 
queen regent mamohato the new kings mother attended mondays 
ceremony held beneath a statue of king moshoeshoe i the new 
kings greatgreatgrandfather 
no royal name has been given the new king but he was expected 
to be called king letsie iii he will be the constitutional monarch 
and head of state but with no executive powers 
moshoeshoe was forced into exile in march following 
disagreements with lekhanya who seized power in a 1986 coup 
lekhanya gave the king some executive authority but in 
february he fired most of moshoeshoes supporters from the 
government and told the king to leave when he refused to approve 
replacements 
last month lekhanya invited moshoeshoe back from exile in 
london but he said last week the king had set unacceptable 
conditions for returning and therefore had been stripped of his 
title and powers 
lekhanya said one condition set by moshoeshoe was dissolution of 
the government 
it was not clear if moshoeshoe would return to lesotho 
lekhanya said the deposed king had been granted amnesty and a 
government news release monday said none of moshoeshoes property 
would be confiscated 
lesotho is a mountainous landlocked country of about 15 
million people completely surrounded by south africa lesotho 
gained independence from britain in 1966 
lekhanya has promised to return lesotho to civilian rule in 
1992

the nations roman catholic bishops today 
called for sharp limitations on any use of military force by the 
united states in the persian gulf 
they said church principles ruled out any tactics that would 
target civilian lives adding that would mean any gulf conflict 
would have to be a limited war 
the bishops urged that the united states stay the course of 
persistent peaceful and determined pressure against iraq for a 
nonviolent solution 
the action came in the opening session of the annual fall 
meeting of the national conference of catholic bishops 
after lengthy discussion they voted 24915 to endorse a letter 
about the gulf crisis written by los angeles archbishop roger 
mahony head of the conferences international affairs committee 
the letter was sent last week to secretary of state james a 
baker iii 
it said resorting to war would violate principles set down in 
the churchs just war theory by jeopardizing many lives 
raising serious moral questions and undermining the international 
solidarity against iraq 
after affirming the letters position the bishops also voted 
126118 to modify their agenda to hold a special closed session 
later on the gulf crisis 
earlier today the president of the conference said the church 
is in a time of testing for the priesthood 
archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati told about 300 
bishops that the clergy seems to be in a period of special 
challenge seminary enrollments down to about a fourth of their 
onetime level have yet to begin climbing from the slump he said 
our priests are fewer and more is being demanded of them than 
ever before he said in his address opening the bishops annual 
fall meeting suspicions have been raised about their 
faithfulness to their commitments 
there have been sad lapses publicly known touching even our 
own bishops conference there are consequent morale problems among 
some of our priests perhaps even among some of us 
pilarczyk appeared to be referring to sexual lapses among some 
priests including a resigned georgia bishop but he did not cite 
specifics 
he pointed out that a world synod of bishops which met last 
month at the vatican strongly affirmed that the priesthood should 
go only to those committed to celibacy 
that has been a church rule since the middle ages but with the 
sharpening shortage of priests many catholics have pressed for a 
priestly option on celibacy 
despite studies finding serious morale problems among clergy 
pilarczyk told fellow prelates 
we may be in a time of testing a period of challenge but i 
know that by and large our priests are happy in their ministry 
and are deeply appreciated by the people they serve 
as the bishops began their fourday meeting a demonstration 
celebrating women was held outside pressing for admission of 
women to the priesthood the womens ordination conference said it 
and about 200 other groups were cosponsoring the block party 
including dancing singing poetry reading and public speaking 
the bishops meeting faced a batch of touchy issues but action 
has been postponed on the most volatile item a proposed pastoral 
teaching document on the role of women 
that was to be discussed thursday but no action was planned 
a draft proposal drawn up in about six years of work and 
hearings was sharply criticized as contradictory and inconsistent 
when it was unveiled earlier this year 
it advocates equality for women but would continue their 
exclusion from ordination 
bishops decided to delay action on the issue after the vatican 
suggested prior consultation with bishops of other countries

a leading conservative is urging reagan 
republicans to decide if they will stand against president bush 
as theodore roosevelts followers stood against william howard taft 
in the bull moose campaign of 1912 
bush has betrayed former president reagans principles just as 
taft strayed from roosevelts says heritage foundation vice 
president burton yale pines 
as in 1912 the responsible response to a party leader who 
betrays the party cannot be silence it must be open criticism 
possibly opposition and maybe even rebellion pines writes in a 
forthcoming article in the foundations magazine policy review 
foundation president edwin fuelner jr in calling attention to 
the article wrote if history truly does repeat itself then 
george bush could become a general without an army in the fall of 
1992 
pines put it this way bushs very poor showing in this 
novembers congressional elections is merely the warning tremor of 
an approaching political earthquake if bush and his advisors 
keep to their current course they are asking for the oneterm 
presidency of william howard bush 
just as reagan left the white house with high approval ratings 
in 1989 after two terms in office roosevelt enjoyed immense 
popularity when he stepped down in 1909 after nearly as long he 
praised taft lavishly just as reagan praised bush 
he split with taft however as the new president moved away 
from roosevelts free trade policies toward protectionism 
after a 1910 midterm election that was a disaster for the 
republicans roosevelt unsuccessfully challenged taft for the 1912 
gop nomination and then ran against taft in a campaign that got its 
name when he told reporters he felt as strong as a bull moose 
the split in republican ranks thrust democrat woodrow wilson 
into the white house 
pines equates the taftroosevelt split over trade with what he 
calls the betrayals of the bush administration and the 
economic and other disasters toward which bush and his top advisers 
are driving the nation 
pines is not specific in his criticisms but conservatives have 
generally lambasted bush for abandoning his campaign pledge not to 
raise taxes 
pines concedes there are differences between 1912 and 1992 for 
one even if he wanted to reagan is now prohibited by the 
constitution from being elected president a third time for 
another roosevelt was a progressive republican not a 
conservative 
there are other differences the writer doesnt mention 
for one the democrats picked up just one senate seat and nine 
house seats last week that was bad for the republicans but 
nothing like the debacle of 1910 when gop house seats dropped from 
219 to 161 
for another reagan has voiced no criticism of his successor and 
recently said bush is doing very well in what is needed 
despite the differences pines argues that the question do we 
bolt the party must be faced 
the time is at hand for conservatives to decide if they will 
stand against their partys leader he wrote 
just as the legions of roosevelt supporters turned on taft for 
betraying roosevelts hardwon victories so are ronald reagans 
legions tempted to turn on bush

jane byrne today officially launched her campaign 
for mayor of chicago an office she occupied from 1979 until she 
was defeated in her 1983 reelection bid by the late harold 
washington 
byrne told reporters she was challenging incumbent mayor richard 
m daley a democrat but she stopped short of saying she was 
running for the democratic nomination 
political pundits including outgoing republican gov james r 
thompson insist it will be difficult to unseat daley whether she 
runs as a democrat or as an independent the mayor has not 
announced whether hell run again but is expected to 
daley was out of town and unvailable for comment and his 
office said no one else there was immediately available to give a 
reaction to byrnes announcement 
byrne said she was running because daley has not been effective 
in fighting crime and tackling public health issues 
byrne was elected mayor in 1979 defeating michael bilandic in a 
primary upset stemming in part from voter anger over delays in 
cleaning streets after a major snowstorm 
she was defeated by washington the citys first black mayor in 
1983 and lost the nomination to washington again in 1987 she also 
lost a bid to become the democratic nominee for cook county clerk 
in 1988 
washington died in late 1987 daley son of the late mayor 
richard j daley was elected to fill his unexpired term last year

attorneys for manuel noriega and cable news network 
agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown at least 
until the us supreme court rules on the issue of taperecorded 
conversations 
under the agreement noriega will not ask for contempt penalties 
as long as cnn continues to refrain from broadcasting tapes between 
the deposed panamanian leader and his lawyers 
us district judge william hoeveler endorsed the deal but once 
again warned cnn noting that over the weekend the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta had backed his original gag 
order 
if you play any tapes in violation of my order you are 
violating not only my order but also the appeals court order 
hoeveler said 
cnns attorney terry bienstock said the network accepted the 
deal but had the right to play other noriega tapes as long as they 
did not include conversations with his lawyers the judge agreed 
in atlanta where the network is based cnn spokesman steve 
haworth said that the network expects to file its appeal to the 
supreme court later in the week 
constitutional law experts said the confrontation could become a 
landmark case 
cnn had defied an order friday by hoeveler by broadcasting an 
excerpt in which the deposed panamanian dictator spoke in spanish 
with a secretary for defense lawyer frank rubino 
cnn decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the 
excerpt early saturday haworth said later saturday the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta upheld hoevelers ruling 
the appeals court also told cnn to give the seven tapes to the 
miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would 
endanger noriegas right to a fair trial on drugtrafficking 
charges that order was also stayed by todays agreement 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel he has been held at a federal 
prison outside miami since his surrender to us forces shortly 
after the invasion of panama in december 
rubino asked hoeveler to find the atlantabased network in 
direct civil contempt and fine the network 300000 for each time 
it televised the tapes and each time it shows them in the future 
cnn accused hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself 
from the case 
floyd abrams a new york constitutional lawyer who served as 
cocounsel for the new york times in the pentagon papers case said 
the cnn case could set precedent because rules involving prior 
restraint have been very clear through the years 
weve almost totally banned prior restraint abrams said 
if the supreme court were to uphold the prior restraint order on 
cnn this would be the first time in our countrys history that any 
such court order had been affirmed by the court 
in the 1971 pentagon papers case the us supreme court said 
the government could not bar publication of classified documents 
about us involvement in vietnam the times appealed rather than 
defy a lower court order 
george rahdert a lawyer at the poynter institute of media 
studies called the cnn case an astonishing illustration of 
censorship but said the network was playing with blasting 
caps by defying the judges order 
its rare in general that a news organization of any kind 
broadcast cable or print would do such a thing said rahdert 
who represents several newspapers it really falls into the 
category of civil disobedience 
cnn president tom johnson said the case is a classic 
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover 
he said the district court and appeals court construed the case 
as a conflict between the sixth amendment which provides a 
defendant a right to a fair trial and the first amendment which 
provides for freedom of the press 
theres a more fundamental issue here reporting the news of 
possible governmental misconduct johnson said if cnn can be 
restrained from airing news about the noriega tapes so can any 
news organization

death squad slayings summary executions 
and torture have persisted in el salvador since the massacre of six 
jesuit priests by soldiers a year ago a un human rights report 
said monday 
the report blames both the usbacked conservative government 
and the farabundo marti national liberation front rebels for the 
continuation of violence 
thus far in 1990 government action against humanitarian 
trade union peasants and other organizations has continued said 
jose antonio pastor a university professor from spain who compiled 
the annual report 
pastor concluded the leftist rebels also executed suspected 
collaborators and used civilians as cover for their guerrilla 
attacks 
summary killings by the rightists decreased since the san jose 
agreement on human rights was signed july 26 pastor said and 
rebel assassinations of suspected government collaborators ceased 
after that date 
pastors sharpest remarks were directed at the government which 
has been criticized for the fatal shootings of six jesuit priests 
their housekeeper and her daughter by soldiers they were killed 
nov 16 1989 a day after a guerrilla offensive began 
in that case he said there seems to be a lack of cooperation 
on the part of the armed forces which has gone so far as the 
destruction of important evidence 
since the assassination of archbishop oscar arnulfo romero 
during mass in 1980 rightist death squads have seen the clergy as 
fair game for attack 
rightwing elements of the military and government view the 
roman catholic churchs advocacy of human rights and social justice 
as a legal adjunct to the rebel effort to overthrow the system 
it must be concluded that the practice of summary executions 
by elements of the state apparatus in particular members of the 
armed forces persisted in the first nine months of 1990 pastor 
said 
pastor counted 40 politically motivated summary executions of 
civilians by security forces from january to august of 1990 
compared with 51 in the same time span in 1989 according to 
figures from the archdiocesan legal protection office 
the office also listed 46 assassinations by death squads in 
january through august 1990 compared with only 17 such slayings in 
the same months of 1989 the salvadoran governments human rights 
commission counted 42 summary killings by security forces in the 
first eight months of 1990 compared with 68 in the same months of 
1989 the government did not keep figures on death squad activity 
the church recorded 12 assassinations by the rebels in the first 
eight months of the year compared with 30 during those months in 
1989 the government counted 49 in the first eight months compared 
to 173 from january to august 1989 
cases of politically motivated disappearances of individuals 
continue to be reported he added and said that rightist death 
squads were probably behind some of them as well as the 
guerrillas 
torture of prisoners continued pastor found with prisoners who

chicago ap playwright arthur miller says americas artists 
are censoring their own works for the sake of government grants 
such selfcensorship allows freedom to be killed without a 
trace miller said sunday at a daylong humanities festival called 
expressions of freedom sponsored by the illinois humanities 
council 
miller 75 whose works include the plays death of a 
salesman and the crucible said the first amendment is the 
artists ultimate weapon against censorship 
it simply cuts through all the arguments and prohibits 
congress from infringing on our freedom of expression said 
mille 
censorship is fear and fear spreads he said in the keynote 
address censorship is the most futile of governmental 
exercises

actress shelley fabares says alzheimers disease 
stopped her mother from remembering that she would have preferred 
suicide to suffering from the affliction that deteriorates the 
brain 
fabares currently appearing in the series coach said she 
learned of her mothers preoccupation with the disease after she 
had to take over her affairs 
in taking over her papers i discovered that shed been making 
donations to an alzheimers association for years fabares told 
an interviewer for redbook magazine 
mother once told my sister that if she ever found out she had 
alzheimers she would kill herself fabares said fortunately 
by the time she was diagnosed she was too far gone to remember 
what shed said 
her mother had lost the ability to speak lucidly before she 
deteriorated to the point where she had to be institutionalized in 
february the actress said 
one thing that was so painful for my sister and me was that 
mother would get very close to our faces scream at the top of her 
lungs then hit her cheeks and point inside her mouth and sob 
fabares said you cant get a clearer communication than that of 
help im trapped and dying inside

the countdown toward this weeks 
launch of the space shuttle atlantis proceeded without mishap 
monday after months of delays caused by fuel leaks and lastminute 
problems with a spy satellite 
nasa plans to send up atlantis sometime between 630 pm and 
1030 pm est thursday its fifth nighttime shuttle launch 
because the defense department flight is secret the exact time 
will not be announced until nine minutes before liftoff 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said the countdown which began 
sunday night was proceeding smoothly we dont have any 
problems she said 
weather forecasts were less favorable air force meteorologists 
predicted a 40 percent chance of good weather at launch time 
as with the six previous pentagon missions the national 
aeronautics and space administration refused to discuss the 
shuttles cargo or provide any flight details the mission is 
expected to last about four days during which atlantis five 
astronauts are to deploy a satellite that reportedly will spy on 
iraq and other areas 
the mission originally was scheduled for july but was delayed 
indefinitely after atlantis sprang dangerous hydrogen leaks similar 
to those afflicting the shuttle columbia nasa temporarily grounded 
the entire fleet in june 
nasa tried three times in late august and september to launch 
columbia but it was forced to halt two countdowns because of 
leaking hydrogen and another because of problems with the 
astronomical observatory it was to carry 
fueling tests last month cleared both columbia and atlantis for 
flight 
nasa set nov 9 as atlantis launch date but on oct 31 the air 
force delayed the mission because of undisclosed trouble with the 
spy satellite 
nasa plans to launch columbia two to three weeks after atlantis 
flight that will enable the space agency to close the year with 
six shuttle flights three fewer than planned

an outbreak of violence today forced police to halt 
a march through paris by more than 100000 high school students 
the largest protest yet in a campaign for better education 
the main throng of marchers was orderly but several hundred 
youths on the fringes of the crowd smashed windows set fire to 
cars looted a clothing store stoned police and attacked 
journalists 
police made at least 20 arrests and used tear gas and a water 
cannon to repel troublemakers many of them masking their faces 
with hoods or scarves 
in dozens of smaller cities across france more than 150000 
other students joined marches coinciding with the paris protest 
most were peaceful but a dozen youths were arrested after 
vandalism in the eastern city of montbelaird 
as the paris marchers began to disperse at nightfall education 
minister lionel jospin emerged from talks with student leaders to 
announce an emergency plan to improve frances high schools he 
said details would be worked out in negotiations involving students 
and government officials 
a separate delegation of 20 students met with president francois 
mitterrand one of the youths said after the 45minute meeting that 
mitterrand agreed with their demands 
organizers claimed that 200000 students joined the paris march 
other observers estimated the turnout at closer to 100000 
about two hours after the march began paris police chief pierre 
verbrugghe demanded that student leaders order the protesters to 
disperse he said the throng would not be allowed to cross from the 
left bank of the seine river to the planned ending point on the 
champs elysees 
beneath banners demanding more government spending on their 
schools the paris marchers set out from the place de la bastille 
where revolutionaries stormed the bastille prison 201 years ago 
their destination was the rond point a traffic circle four miles 
away on the champs elysees 
streets and subway stations along much of the route were closed 
by police paralyzing transportation in a large section of central 
paris 
the dozens of previous student marches and rallies across france 
over the past four weeks have been peaceful except for sporadic 
vandalism blamed by student leaders on provocateurs 
many sidewalk cafes along the march route were closed as a 
precaution and police said two youths were arrested after some 
street vendors were robbed 
verbrugghe said he was deploying 5000 officers to cope with the 
march but they were ordered to avoid force against anyone 
demonstrating peacefully 
scores of offduty members of a major police union wearing 
civilian clothes joined student leaders at the head of the march 
and offered to assist in any negotiations with uniformed police 
also among the marchers were officials of industrial trade 
unions and several national teachers associations 
throughout the morning hundreds of youths poured out of trains 
at paris railway stations in most cases the outoftown 
protesters had either forced their way onto the trains without 
paying or had obtained discounts of 60 to 70 percent after 
blockading tracks at provincial stations last week 
in caen students were allowed to board a train after being 
asked to pay whatever they could afford 
in lyon students rented an entire train with 480 raised 
through public donations during recent protests and in grenoble a 
regional administrative council provided funds to carry about 1000 
students on a train to paris 
students arriving in paris found smiling policemen waiting for 
them at improvised information booths telling them where to 
assemble for the march 
the students want more government spending to improve security 
upgrade substandard facilities modernize curriculums and hire more 
teachers many high schools have more than 35 students per class 
they have also have demanded greater freedom of expression and 
assembly

newspaper carrier johnny gosch missing 
for more than eight years would have been 21 monday and his mother 
says the pain of not knowing what happened to him gets worse with 
time 
noreen goschs son disappeared sept 5 1982 from a street near 
his home just as he was about to begin delivering sunday 
newspapers 
most of the time im really good i distance myself from the 
pain i put it on the shelf said mrs gosch of suburban west 
des moines but every so often something will sneak in a 
memory a song without realizing it youre reduced to tears in 
seconds it hits so fast 
ive been through a lot of losses but it is different when 
you dont have an answer 
the longer it goes youd think it would be further removed 
emotionally but it kind of works the opposite 
weve missed all the years of him growing up its painful we 
were at a family gathering recently and a lot of nieces and 
nephews were there there are a lot of them johnnys age its real 
hard going to someplace like that you see everybody elses kid 
grew up she said 
the most devastating news she said was when investigators 
turned up a false alarm last spring the body of a man bearing 
identification of john gosch was found in mexico but it turned out 
the body was that of a man with the same name and age who had 
disappeared from tacoma wash three years earlier 
we came close to an answer even though it would have been a 
bad one that was real tough it was hard on us emotionally she 
said 
in the months following johnnys disappearance the gosches 
raised tens of thousands of dollars to publicize the case and hire 
private investigators 
mrs gosch also renewed her appeal for a michigan man released 
from prison last year after serving time for defrauding the 
gosches to contact the family about possible clues in the case 
robert herman meier of bay city mich contacted them several 
years ago and asked for money in return for information on the 
abduction the gosches convinced that meier was credible gave him 
10000 
meier later pleaded guilty to fraud and served about 18 months 
he as released from an iowa prison about a year and a half ago no 
money was recovered 
she said the state parole board will not give them information 
on meiers whereabouts agreeing only to send him a letter inviting 
him to contact the family

the nations big cities need to organize their 
plea to washington like a political campaign a group of mayors 
said monday at the start of urban summit 1990 
it seems to us that we need to do a better job of packaging 
the nature of our problems said los angeles mayor tom bradley 
one of more than 30 mayors attending the twoday summit in 
manhattan 
bradley was joined at a media briefing by san diego mayor 
maureen oconnor and new york mayor david dinkins who organized 
the meeting to help find ways to solve the nations urban problems 
the summit is focusing on issues such as housing aids 
prevention and treatment combating drug abuse improving education 
and paying for costly projects such as bridges and roads 
the mayors complained that the federal government has mandated 
programs at the local level without providing cities with the money 
to pay for them 
over the last decade we have lost about 26 percent of the 
federal support which we once enjoyed bradley said in 
addition more programs have been dumped on the cities more 
problems exist in those cities 
so weve been hit with a double whammy 
dinkins just last week announced that he intended to cut 5400 
city jobs to close a 388 million municipal budget gap 
bradley said the mayors are working to package their ideas and 
present them in such a way that congress and president bush cant 
ignore them 
we think that we have to run this like a political campaign 
he said it has to be said over and over again until they finally 
get the message 
oconnor said the cities are asking the federal government to 
pay their fair share 
what were all finding together is that one voice in 
washington is not enough she said we need to stand 
together

a letter sent by a sailor on the 
first submarine to sail under the ice of the north pole arrived at 
his brothers home last week 32 years after the historic voyage 
denny breese now a 56yearold treasure hunter living in north 
carolina was a 25yearold seaman when he wrote the letter aboard 
the worlds first nuclearpowered submarine the uss nautilus 
it was addressed to his younger brother nick who lived then at 
the familys home in chula vista about 10 miles south of san 
diego 
the letter said in part 
this will be short i just found out the mail is leaving 
the boat in about 15 minutes i just want you to get this envelope 
that was stamped from the north pole 
although the letter was sent with a sense of urgency either 
rain sleet snow an iceberg or some other force delayed its 
delivery neither nick now a 50yearold salesman who lives in 
fort worth texas nor his brother has lived at the chula vista 
home in more than 20 years 
kathy atkinson who lives at the breeses old address was 
surprised when she looked through the mail thursday and found an 
envelope that was postmarked uss nautilus north pole 1115 
pm aug 3 1958 
ive heard about this kind of thing happening she said 
but 32 years later 
atkinson and a roommate contacted breeses father who still 
leaves in chula vista and the letter eventually found its way to 
its intended recipient 
im glad nick got the letter denny breese said sunday 
from his houseboat in beaufort nc hes certainly going to be 
surprised 
the letter was sent with a sevencent stamp depicting president 
woodrow wilson it arrived open but otherwise intact 
its impossible to tell where its been said mike cannone 
a postal service spokesman in san diego this happens 
occasionally 
the 323footlong nautilus was launched in january 1955 and had 
a crew of more than 100 it made the first transpolar voyage 
beneath the north pole on aug 3 1958

the white house pledged today president bush 
will work closely with congress on the persian gulf crisis but said 
he might be forced to order military action on his own in the event 
of unforeseen kinds of provocations 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater addressing 
concerns raised by democratic lawmakers said bush will work with 
congress every step of the way we have no intention of leaving 
congress out 
fitzwater added he will follow the constitutional 
requirements and we would want to consult with the congress every 
step of the way but there are always those unforeseen kinds of 
provocations that might result in having to move first 
congress needs to be involved in any decision to fight several 
congressional democrats said sunday several days after bush 
announced plans to nearly double the 230000 troops in the persian 
gulf to provide an adequate offensive option 
the last thing we need is to have a war over there a bloody 
war and have american boys being sent and brought back in body 
bags and yet not have the american people behind them said 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga weve 
gone that route one time we dont need to do it again 
without saying so directly fitzwater suggested the democrats 
were overreacting not a shots been fired what are these guys 
talking about he said 
fitzwater added the congress wants to be vigilant and on top 
of this urge caution all the way and thats appropriate 
its not for the president by himself to decide whether or not 
to go to war sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said today 
he has to have the congress with him that is the law 
if george bush wants his presidency to die in the arabian 
desert hes going at it very steadily and as if it were a plan 
moynihan said on abcs good morning america 
its as if that great force that was created to fight the cold 
war is at the presidents own disposal for any diversion he may 
wish no matter what it costs he will wreck our military he will 
wreck his administration and hell spoil a chance to get a 
collective security system working it breaks the heart moynihan 
said 
rep lee hamilton dind said bush ought to have the 
broadest possible achievable international consensus before 
launching an offensive 
the decision to go to war ought to be a shared responsibility 
it ought not to be made by one person even if that person is the 
president of the united states hamilton a key house foreign 
relations committee member said on nbctvs meet the press 
program 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine appearing on 
abctvs this week with david brinkley said congress must vote 
before america goes to war and senate foreign relations chairman 
claiborne pell dri said the united nations should have some 
input before us troops go into combat 
nunn said bushs new offensive posture was at sharp odds with 
the original objective of defending saudi arabia 
it is something the military were not given to begin with and 
were not prepared for nunn said on the cbstv program face the 
nation and i think the president has a real obligation here 
perhaps he can do this he should to explain why liberating 
kuwait is in our vital interest 
sen richard g lugar rind said congress should vote on a 
declaration of war before any substantial military conflict with 
iraq and vietnamera secretary of state henry kissinger said 
lawmakers should not be allowed to claim they were kept ignorant as 
the nation became embroiled in war 
mitchell reiterating recent statements said congress and 
only congress can commit the nation to war the president has no 
legal authority 
he and house armed service committee chairman les aspin dwis 
said it was not time yet to call congress into session for such a 
debate they said it would only be hypothetical because bush 
has not yet decided to launch combat operations in the gulf 
pell also appearing on meet the press said that unless 
us lives were at stake america should not launch a combat drive 
without congressional approval if not a declaration of war at 
least a resolution of authorization 
nunn renewed an earlier warning against american involvement in 
a ground war in the region 
i think getting bogged down in a ground war there is the last 
thing we want and plays right into saddam husseins hands and makes 
our logistics difficulties which are already present much more 
difficult he said

political analysts assume the american people 
would rally behind president bush if the united states went to war 
against iraq but they also predict a prolonged conflict with high 
casualties could hurt his chances for a second term 
i think thats going to be the wild card in this next 
presidential election said john white a former democratic party 
chairman if we have a war if there are high casualties it will 
be a referendum on george bush 
there was bipartisan agreement that if the president decides to 
go to war he must do a better job telling the american people why 
that step is necessary 
we learned from vietnam that americans have to be convinced 
and sold on a rationale for our involvement said neil newhouse 
a pollster with the republican firm headed by richard wirthlin 
once involved in a conflict he said dont overestimate the 
patience of the american people and dont underestimate the 
expectations 
newhouse said most americans expect a war with iraq would be won 
as quickly as the actions against grenada and panama which ended 
within days 
white predicted that in the event of war the democrats would 
have to nominate for president in 1992 someone who warned or 
tried to prevent this thing from happening 
democrats who fit that description are beginning to emerge 
among them sen sam nunn of georgia chairman of the senate armed 
services committee 
on sunday nunn said that the last thing we need is to have a 
war over there a bloody war and have american boys being sent and 
brought back in body bags and yet not have the american people 
behind them 
nunn frequently is mentioned as a likely contender for the 1992 
democratic presidential nomination 
sen robert kerrey dneb a decorated veteran of the vietnam 
war also has been an early critic of the extent of the us 
buildup in the persian gulf 
theres not a lot of mileage in backing off saddam hussein 
said peter teeley a consultant and longtime adviser to bush 
clearly nobody wants to see american boys in a shooting war but 
the fact of the matter is that saddams going to have to be dealt 
with at some point in time one way or the other 
after bush announced last week that up to 200000 more us 
troops were being dispatched to the region speculation intensified 
that the president was ready to go on the offensive to dislodge 
saddam hussein from kuwait 
accompanying that was a flurry of discussion of what impact war 
would have on the next presidential election would the expected 
surge of support for american servicemen in combat be transferred 
to the president who ordered them there 
we can say heres what we think will happen or heres how the 
american people will react said democratic pollster peter hart 
nobody can know you dont know how you would react i dont know 
how i would react 
conservative david keene said the impact of a war on the 1992 
elections would depend on how the war goes and how well the 
president is able to articulate his reasons for taking that step i 
think the public will support a winning military effort if it isnt 
too costly or too long if they undersand the reasons for it 
the problem at this point is that weve gotten ourselves 
bogged down over there for a long period of time with the president 
issuing conflicting reasons and rationales for our being there 
sometimes its to deter aggression sometimes its energy 
sometimes its democratic values 
even a victory with high casualties will probably destroy his 
presidency said white who had an insiders view of the 
devastating impact of the middle east on jimmy carters presidency 
he can take some casualties if hes showing that were winning 
and if theres a quick end to it said white but if its a 
stalemate he cant take casualties and if its a loss he cant 
take casualties 
the world is going to hold its breath hoping that saddam 
hussein backs down said mike mccurry a consutant and former 
communications director of the democratic national committee if 
he doesnt there is going to be a war and there are going to be 
us casualties opposition will rise naturally to military 
action unless hes made a good case on why were going to have make 
some supreme sacrifices

former contra rebels and supporters on 
monday blocked roads to two more towns in a spreading protest of 
president violeta chamorros administration 
riot police using tear gas tried to destroy one roadblock but 
were forced to withdraw when the people manning the barricades shot 
at them the roman catholic churchs radio station radio catolica 
reported 
the reported shooting took place near boaco 56 miles northeast 
of managua protesters also blocked the road leading to san rafael 
del norte in northern nicaragua 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo said despite the breakdown 
of weekend negotiations between mrs chamorro and mayors of 16 
towns in southeastern nicaragua who support the protest the 
government is still willing to negotiate 
whenever they decide they want to talk were here lacayo 
said 
the mayors had not yet responded to a proposal by mrs chamorro 
to hold a meeting wednesday in the southeastern town of juigalpa to 
discuss their demands lacayo said 
for the last 10 days former contra rebels and supporters have 
placed barricades along the rama road the only overland connection 
between the rich southeast agricultural region and the rest of the 
nation 
the negotiations broke down early sunday after 10 hours when 
the mayors 
wyss predicted that fixedrate mortgages which stand just above 
10 percent nationally could dip to 95 percent in coming weeks 
many economists believe that a recessionary economy would also 
help to push interest rates lower because of sluggish demand for 
loans 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting company said he 
expected the recession to last through most of 1991 
the unemployment rate will keep rising all year long with the 
economic downturn lasting for four to five quarters he said

michael heseltine a flamboyant former defense 
secretary has two das left to decide whether to attempt the 
onceunthinkable ousting margaret thatcher as conservative party 
leader and thus prime minister 
the crisis has thrown the partys normally welldisciplined 
legislators into turmoil and suddenly all bets are off 
with a mixture of behindthescenes threats promises and 
cajoling thatcher loyalists and heseltine supporters are taking 
soundings adding up pledges and consulting crystal balls 
some heseltine supporters claim they are within sight of the 159 
votes needed to force a second ballot among the 372 conservative 
legislators in the house of commons who elect the party leader 
the leader of the party with a majority in the 650member 
commons is automatically the prime minister 
mrs thatchers supporters are seizing on everything from the 
persian gulf crisis to the sheer dominance of the woman who has led 
the party for 15 years and put her stamp on the nation through 11 
years in power 
the nomination deadline is noon thursday and if theres a 
challenger a secret ballot will be held nov 20 under the rules 
mrs thatcher must get 50 percent of the votes cast and be 15 
percent clear of the next placed to avoid a runoff if not a 
second ballot with more newcomers would be held a week later 
whatever happens it promises to be messy for the party 
the problem is that in effect we have no agreed procedure for 
getting rid of the prime minister said denis kavanagh professor 
of politics at nottingham university it is like a presidential 
system without presidential elections 
heseltine 57 has stalked mrs thatcher skillfully since 
quitting her cabinet in january 1986 in a dispute over his plan to 
resuce a helicoptermaker westland 
a tall handsome selfmade millionaire he has toured the 
country addressing party meetings opening fetes assiduously 
avoiding direct criticism of mrs thatcher and biding his time 
for a challenge 
the routine has kept him the most instantly recognized 
politician in britain after mrs thatcher and also polls 
suggest the favorite to succeed her 
the party leader is elected annually in november since mrs 
thatcher ousted edward heath when her party was in opposition in 
1975 she has been reelected unopposed apart from a feeble 
challenge last year 
rebellious murmurs remained as the conservative continued to 
trail the labor party for a dangerously long 16 months mainly 
because of economic troubles 
the latest spark was the nov 1 resignation of deputy prime 
minister sir geoffrey howe in protest of mrs thatchers combative 
stance with the rest of the 12nation european community 
then the proeuropean heseltine struck with a wellpublicized 
letter obliquely criticizing mrs thatcher but he is wavering 
about a challenge 
we have a remarkable leader she goes through 10 remarkable 
years she has a little bad patch and everyone wants her out of the 
way complained bestselling novelist jeffrey archer a former 
deputy chairman of the party that where i come from is 
disloyalty and hypocrisy 
legislator peter templemorris in the heseltine camp said the 
tories were doomed under mrs thatcher and claimed there were 
already 120 antithatcher votes secured 
anything above 120 and obviously the prime ministers position 
becomes extremely difficult to put it mildly he added 
scores of the more discreet legislators are promising support to 
both sides or saying nothing aware of the risk of being seen to 
back the wrong leader 
many believe that a challenge will merely wound mrs thatcher 
and kill the tories chances of reelection 
however theres a potential mine of antithatcher votes they 
include about 60 worried legislators with waferthin majorities in 
their constituencies and 35 more she has fired from her cabinets or 
other government jobs during her 11 years in power

the nations roman catholic bishops on monday 
urged restraint to minimize civilian casualties in any us 
military action in the persian gulf crisis 
citing the churchs longtime just war theory in regard to 
the middle east situation bishops from across the country 
declared 
the military means used must be commensurate with the evil to 
be overcome and must be directed at the aggressors not innocent 
people 
this rules out tactics that could clearly target civilian 
lives and means this war would have to be a limited war the 
bishops said 
they urged that under those circumstances the united states 
stay the course of persistent peaceful and determined pressure 
against iraq using military force as a last resort 
the bishops position was set forth in their affirming of a 
letter about the crisis sent last week by archbishop roger mahony 
of los angeles to secretary of state james a baker iii 
mahony head of the bishops international policy committee 
later told a news conference that the bishops stand countenanced 
military force only after every other avenue has been explored 
and tried 
the situation is fluid and changing daily he said it is 
our hope that no use of force will be attempted 
as the bishops began their annual fall meeting the subject 
highlighted their discussion and indications were they may have 
more to say about it 
although affirming the mahony assessment by a 249 to 15 ballot 
they also decided to modify their agenda to consider the issue 
further 
but this was to be behind doors as moved by cardinal bernard law 
of boston and upheld by a 126 to 118 vote 
in lengthy debate several bishops argued for open discussion of 
the matter 
its important that we do more said auxiliary bishop thomas 
gumbleton of detroit adding that it was critical to americans who 
need moral guidance about it 
the bishops affirmed stand firmly condemns iraqs aggression 
the taking of civilian hostages and the brutal treatment of 
civilians in kuwait 
in church tradition the use of force is not ruled out 
absolutely but there is a clear presumption against war the 
bishops said 
on other matters at the start of a fourday meeting the bishops 
gave preliminary consideration to policy statements on the 
priesthood inclusive language in the liturgy and sex education in 
catholic schools 
indications were that the latter would evoke considerable 
controversy but action on another touchy subject a proposed 
declaration on the role of women was dropped from the agenda 
outside the hotel where the bishops were meeting a throng of 
women demonstrated for the right to be admitted to the priesthood 
discipleship of equals their blackandgold banners 
proclaimed women priests new womennew church and women 
imaging christ 
such imaging is what they cant do says the vatican in 
ruling they cant be priests

from ministers son to congressman to prison 
inmate robert garcia has followed the advice in one of his 
favorite hymns in good times praise his name and in the bad 
times do the same 
and thats the message he wants to share as he embarks on a new 
career in prison ministry garcia said 
nothing guarantees a smooth easy life the 57yearold 
garcia said in a recent interview by knowing god we have the 
ability to handle it and thats all we can ask for in life 
five months after an appeals court reversed his conviction in 
the wedtech corp scandal garcia has joined prison fellowship 
ministries the organization founded by chuck colson of watergate 
notoriety 
in terms of their spiritual lives its important that inmates 
understand our relationships with god are the most important thing 
we have he said 
garcia says his faith has carried him through since january 197 
when several wedtech officers pleaded guilty to paying bribes to 
obtain military contracts and gave prosecutors names of those they 
said were involved 
the democratic congressman who represented the south bronx 
neighborhood where wedtech was located was among several local 
politicians charged in the corruption scheme garcia and his wife 
jane were accused of demanding payoffs from wedtech in return for 
his influence in washington 
a jury convicted them last year of extortion and both were 
sentenced to three years in prison with the recommendation they be 
released on parole after serving six months garcia resigned his 
congressional seat on jan 19 after his conviction 
he spent 104 days at the minimumsecurity federal prison at 
eglin air force base in florida before the conviction was 
overturned in june the appeals court which found the jury had not 
been properly instructed on the law left open the possibility of a 
new trial for garcia and his wife who remained free while their 
appeal was being heard 
federal prosecutors decided to continue the case and the garcias 
will be retried beginning next month unless a judge accepts their 
argument that they cant be tried twice for the same offense 
garcia has a wide range of experience with prison life 
as a young state senator from the bronx he was called on to 
serve as a negotiator during the bloody uprising at the attica 
state prison in 1971 
he also served as chairman of the state senates crime and 
correction committee which required his visiting many of the 
states facilities 
ive come full circle in this thing garcia said 
as a paid consultant with prison fellowship garcia will help 
develop a program to match released inmates with churches in their 
communities and lobby his former colleagues on capitol hill on 
prison reform issues 
garcia said he first got the idea of working for colsons 
organization when he attended a bible study group run by prison 
fellowship 
but prison ministry is something he would best like to do from 
the outside 
if there was any one time in my life i wanted to yell and 
scream about how happy i was that was it garcia said

authorities are tightening security at american 
university branches in italy because a purported terrorist group 
has threatened to attack the schools if us troops move against 
iraq officials said monday 
we have been in touch with the schools and with the italian 
police and are working with them to assure they have the protection 
needed said a us embassy spokesman 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said six 
american university branches in florence and bologna had recently 
received threatening letters from a previously unknown group 
calling itself the secret popular revolutionary movement 
if the imperialist americans attack iraqi territory we will 
hit hard american interests in the cities said the letters 
according to italian news reports 
the embassy spokesman said he could not release the names of the 
universities involved 
italian newspapers have identified four of them as georgetown 
stanford and syracuse in florence and johns hopkins in bologna 
a stanford official said its branch in florence was not among 
those affected eileen walsh acting director of stanford news 
service spoke from palo alto calif 
michael good director of the syracuse program in florence said

convinced of the threat even though were not convinced 
a police spokesman in florence said police were investigating 
the threats and that surveillance of universities buildings had 
been increased he declined to specify which facilities 
the embassy spokesman said it was impossible to judge the 
credibility of the threats we take all threats seriously but no 
one has ever heard of this group before he said 
the spokesman would not describe how security had been 
increased 
each of them is taking the measures they feel is 
appropriate he said they are working with the police so that 
whatever can be done is done

when sgt george yakstis came 
home from vietnam nearly 20 years ago people spit and called him a 
baby killer he said he quickly realized that not all his 
enemies were in southeast asia 
two decades later yakstis and other vietnam veterans in 
operation desert shield said the return to active service has been 
a healing process of sorts 
on monday they marked veterans day by recalling the animosity 
of a former time and savoring a surge of domestic support for their 
current mission 
i can remembering flying into san francisco at the end of my 
tour and having to take off my uniform and put on my civilian 
clothes because people were asking questions like how many babies 
did you kill yakstis said 
the soldier from rockaway nj and deployed with the 253rd 
transportation company of the new jersey national guard said some 
people even spit on him 
i think itll be different when we come back next time he 
said i think our parade will be even bigger than when we left 
about 15 percent of the national guardsmen here are vietnam 
veterans although the total number of vets among the 230000 us 
troops deployed in saudi arabia since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait is not known 
sgt 1st class jim calvini of norwell mass said he will 
never forget the ridicule and hatred he faced upon returning from 
vietnam in 1969 
we were all baby killers he said there was no parade we 
were sent to do a dirty job and people thought that was that its 
something ill never forget 
but he said the support in massachusetts for him and the other 
members of the 1058 transport company of the national guard has 
helped him to forgive 
those people were amazing he said it was unbelievable 
the sendoff we got flags were all over town and yellow ribbons and 
everything 
yakstis and many other veterans said they were moved by the 
parades that many towns organized to bid farewell to troops called 
to active duty for veterans it was like a late cominghome party 
when i drove away i was in the truck by myself and i started 
to cry said sgt joseph marchina also of the 253rd im not 
afraid to admit i left some tears behind that parade felt like it 
was what should have happened 20 years ago 
marchina of north cape may nj said he is confident that 
support for their current mission will remain firm at home 
the vietam veterans have found themselves boosting the morale 
of younger soldiers 
although living conditions in the airplane 
hangarsturneddormitories are cramped and unsanitary the veterans 
have seen worse the filthy latrines the narrow cots and the 
coolwater showers theyve seen them before 
i was complaining about the showers and our vietnam guys told 
me they had to get clean in the creek when they were there said 
spc tracey king 23 of lewisburg tenn they kind of help us 
appreciate what we do have 
king of the 251st transportation company of the national guard 
said the veterans get an extra bit of respect in the camps 
regardless of rank 
everyone knows what they went through and we aint been 
through nothing like they have king said we kind of look up 
to them

members of congress expressed increasing worry 
monday over president bushs latest moves in the persian gulf 
warning that he is stepping out ahead of his carefully created 
international consensus and that americans as well as allies may 
balk at going to war 
if george bush wants his presidency to die in the arabian 
desert hes going to get his wish sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny a member of the foreign relations committee said in an 
interview 
bushs spokesman quickly retorted not a shots been fired 
what are these guys talking about 
the spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush has no intention of 
leaving congress out of his decisionmaking 
they know what were doing fitzwater said theyve been 
kept informed every step of the way its appropriate that they be 
cautious that they express these concerns theres nothing wrong 
with that 
following bushs announcement last week that the united states 
will begin a huge new deployment to gain an offensive capability in 
the region the tone on capitol hill has shifted from cautious 
support to apprehension 
speaking in albany ga on monday democratic sen wyche fowler 
said congress should come back into session after thanksgiving to 
debate the issue and to better define americas goals what will 
constitute victory how long it might take and more importantly 
to pursue every economic and diplomatic strategy so that hopefully 
we can eliminate the military option 
moynihans comment was among the harshest assessments yet of the 
presidents handling of the crisis which has enjoyed broad if 
nervous support from congress since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
others including rep william broomfield rmich the senior 
gop member of the foreign affairs committee have voiced concern 
over the presidents failure to consult broadly with congress on 
the latest deployment 
but fitzwater said public support for bush has been very 
strong and added we dont want to go to war president bush 
will say the same things these congressmen are saying be 
cautious follow the policy support the un resolutions consult 
with congress 
bush has said he still hopes economic sanctions backed by united 
nations resolutions and supported by most foreign nations will 
persuade iraq to leave kuwait without fighting 
one senior congressional aide speaking on condition of 
anonymity said lawmakers who have spent time among the voters in 
recent weeks are reflecting public unease with the gulf situation 
the aide predicted that bush would come under heavier fire from the 
democraticcontrolled congress in the coming weeks 
senior administration officials including secretary of defense 
dick cheney and joint chiefs of staff chairman colin powell are to 
brief lawmakers on tuesday for the first time since congress 
adjourned oct 28 and members of the bipartisan leadership were 
scheduled to meet with bush at the white house on wednesday 
senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said 
he was not consulted about the latest troop buildup and received a 
call only friday the day after bush announced it publicly 
i havent been told reasons why we have to rush this thing 
nunn said in a weekend television interview why not let the 
embargo work war should be the last option 
nunn said bush has failed to explain either to congress or the 
american people why the liberation of kuwait is an interest so 
important were willing to spend thousands of american lives if 
necessary 
moynihan said he was stunned by last weeks developments 
including the announcement that us troops would not be rotated 
home from their gulf positions and the administrations conclusion 
that the united states is free under the united nations charter to 
take whatever military action it wants 
thats the pattern of a country going to war moynihan said 
hes decided hes gone unilateral 
moynihan hypothetically posed two newspaper headlines us 
invades third world country in dispute over access to raw 
materials and world unites in support of tiny nation overrun 
by brutal aggressor 
the second is the story the united states wants he said but 
bush by going it alone is risking the first headline 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he 
believed bushs actions are less ominous that the white house is 
simply seeking to use a heightened threat of war to force iraq to 
capitulate without shots being fired 
but he also cautioned that the constitution gives congress alone 
the power to commit us troops to war he noted that congress 
could be called back into session to debate that question if an act 
of war occurs or if the president decides war is necessary 
meanwhile a spokesman for the new yorkbased center for 
constitutional rights said some members of congress are likely to 
seek legal action in the courts to force bush to comply with the 
war powers act 
its apparent that a lot of congress people have questions 
about the procedural action said david lerner a spokesman for 
the group a lot of them are worried that while they are out war 
will break out 
center attorneys have previously represented individual 
lawmakers on similar attempts to force the white house to consult 
congress before deploying more troops 
at least one lawmaker rep ronald dellums dcalif has 
contacted the center to discuss the possibility of bringing a new 
court case lerner said 
the war powers act requires presidential consultation with 
congress and puts limits on troop deployments without direct 
congressional authorization if troops are fighting or under 
imminent threat of hostilities 
such suits in the past have been dismissed on the ground that 
the courts cannot enter political debates over foreign policy but 
lerner said center attorneys feel it is important to raise the 
issue in as many forums as possible

in an effort to avoid further un security 
council criticism israeli officials on monday offered to receive a 
un envoy to discuss the treatment of palestinians under israeli 
occupation 
the offer was billed as a compromise and the government made it 
clear that its offer did not change israels rejection of a 
security council resolution condemning the oct 8 temple mount 
killings and demanding an investigation 
sari nusseibeh a proplo palestinian leader in jerusalem 
rejected the israeli proposal as a fruitless enterprise 
what the palestinians need is tangible effective 
international involvement nusseibeh said the palestine 
liberation organization has called for a un force to protect the 
17 million arabs in the occupied lands 
an israeli government official said the compromise proposal was 
worked out in negotiations with the united states which reportedly 
refused an earlier israeli plea to veto any further un criticism 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said israel 
had reached an understanding with washington but he did not 
make clear if his government had a guarantee that the united states 
would veto further criticism 
i cannot guarantee this or another move in the name of the 
united states foreign minister david levy said but after 
intensive contacts with the most senior levels in the united states 
one can report a good progress 
we have returned to the basic understanding that is necessary 
in the relations between the two countries i am pleased he 
said 
israel radio said the united states had agree to work to remove 
the temple mount killings from the un agenda if israel received a 
un envoy 
american officials have said they want world attention shifted 
from israel and back to the persian gulf crisis and they have 
pressured israel to accept an investigation into the temple mount 
killings israeli police shot to death 20 palestinians in rioting 
at the holy site 
un spokeswoman nadia younes said in new york that 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is now considering 
sending an emissary 
however she added we do not accept conditions on the terms 
of the visit 
the us ambassador to the united nations thomas r pickering 
said of the israeli proposal im not sure that that is 
necessarily going to be possible but we want to take a careful 
look at this and well be in touch with people about it 
levy outlined the proposal monday at a closeddoor session of 
parliaments defense and foreign affairs committee 
he reportedly ordered no official statements be made on the 
compromise proposal 
but the government official who explained the agreement said 
israels idea was to urge perez de cuellar to dispatch his aide 
jean claude aime in continuation of his mission of june 1990 
aime was last in israel to look into the killings of seven 
palestinians by an israeli in the tel aviv suburb of rishon lezion 
on may 20 and subsequent riots in the occupied territories in which 
15 palestinians died in army gunfire his report was never made 
public here 
the israeli official said the new mission would be detached 
and have no connection with security council calls for an 
investigation of the temple mount but would be aimed at reducing 
tensions with the united nations 
israel has argued that accepting a security council 
investigation of the temple mount would threaten the nations claim 
to east jerusalem the jewish state captured the arab eastern 
sector of the city from jordan in the 1967 middle east war and 
later annexed it the annexation is not recognized by most nations 
after israels rejection of two security council votes and 
refusal to cooperate with a un probe perez de cuellar declared 
that israel had failed to protect palestinians 
he suggested a meeting by the 164 nations that signed the 1949 
geneva conventions which outline rules on treatment of civilians 
in war to study ways to safeguard palestinians in captured 
territory

aids activists challenged researchers monday 
to find more effective treatments within the next 18 months for the 
infections that most often kill people with aids 
members of act up the aids coalition to unleash power released 
a detailed research plan at a news conference and then at a meeting 
of aids researchers saying potential therapies still have not been 
studied 
this is doable said garance frankeruta of act up this 
is a realistic plan its about removing the obstacles to 
getting science done quickly and saving lives 
coalition members have complained that federal research efforts 
have focused too narrowly on deactivating the aids virus and not 
enough on preventing and treating the infections that prey on the 
weakened immune systems of those infected with the virus 
dr anthony fauci head of the national institute on allergy and 
infectious diseases called the plan reasonable 
most of what theyre talking about is already in motion he 
said whether these infections will be conquered in 18 months 
i cant predict i hope we can 
the plan targets the five opportunistic infections that kill 90 
percent of people with aids pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 
cytomegalovirus toxoplasma gondii mycobacterium avium 
intracellulare and various fungal infections 
though drugs have been developed to combat some of those 
infections not all patients can tolerate the treatments and in 
some cases the drugs are too toxic to be used with azt the only 
fdaapproved drug that fights the aids virus directly 
the coalition also said useful therapies have been delayed in 
the red tape of the bureaucracy 
essentially nobodys home when it comes to aids

a protein that a researcher calls the heart 
attack maker is elevated in black americans and could explain 
their increased rate of heart attacks says a study released 
monday 
it is helpful in explaining why some individuals have heart 
attacks at early ages said dr thomas pearson of the mary 
imogene bassett research institute in cooperstown ny 
a study of white and black doctors in their 50s revealed that 
levels of the protein were more than twice as high in the blacks 
pearson said at the annual scientific meeting of the american heart 
association 
the protein called lipoprotein a or lpa is related to and 
probably works like ldl the socalled bad cholesterol pearson 
said 
i call it the heart attack maker he said because it packs 
a double punch like ldl it encourages the clogging of arteries 
but unlike ldl it also interferes with an enzyme that helps to 
dissolve the resulting clots 
last year pearsons study of black and white doctors led him to 
the finding that the risk of heart disease in the black doctors was 
24 times that of the risk in the white doctors 
the discovery of a corresponding difference in lpa levels 
may be a new area to help explain that he said 
we think that lpa is a major major risk factor right up 
there with hypertension for coronary heart disease in blacks 
pearson said 
the study was done on 106 white doctors who graduated from the 
johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore and 92 
black graduates of meharry medical college in nashville 
pearson and his colleagues looked not only at lpa levels in 
the doctors but also at their levels of socalled good cholesterol 
or hdl which protects against heart disease 
the researchers found in the whites that the higher their lpa 
level the lower their hdl in the blacks the results were the 
opposite the higher the lpa levels the higher the levels of 
protective hdl 
so why did the black have the increased heart disease risk it 
is certainly hard to understand pearson said but he speculated 
that genetic or other differences between blacks and whites could 
affect lpa levels 
pearson said the close link between lpa levels and heart 
disease risk in blacks means that lpa levels could be used to 
identify blacks who are at risk of heart disease even though their 
other measures of heart disease risk might be normal 
before that can be done however researchers must further 
clarify the role of lpa in heart disease and must devise better 
means of measuring lpa levels pearson said 
so far he said this is still very much on the research 
front

the uss williamsburg president trumans 
official yacht is for sale to the highest bidder willing to have 
the vessel made seaworthy a spokeswoman for the city government 
said monday 
tara hamilton a spokeswoman for the district of columbias 
public works department said the williamsburg has been anchored 
near a sewage plant for a year as the city searched for a buyer 
she declined comment on reports that the vessel which featured 
black steel with teak trim and polished brass during its heyday 
had fallen into disrepair and that its 243foothulk had trees 
growing through it 
the kansas city star reported sunday that the ship had been 
vandalized and that its deck was covered with broken glass and 
empty beer bottles 
if no one purchases the vessel which also served a brief stint 
as a floating restaurant in new jersey and before that as a 
floating laboratory by the national science foundation in norfolk 
va it faces demolition in july 1992 the newspaper said 
richard lynn the owner of river city usa in kansas city 
kan once looked into buying the williamsburg according to kc 
stanley a spokeswoman for the company 
she said lynn had hoped the 2000ton ship was salvageable and 
could be used as a floating museum of american history 
we were mainly interested in the boat because of its 
historical significance said ms stanley who is also a licensed 
riverboat pilot 
but when we learned that the vessel was in such disrepair we 
decided that the investment wasnt worth what it would have cost to 
salvage it 
the restoration of the 36footwide vessel with a 14footdraft 
would cost an estimated 7 million more if the ship is to ever 
sail again according to naval experts 
the williamsburg could be eligible for federal funds if it were 
ever named a national landmark

boris yeltsin president of the russian republic 
said monday that russia would not pull out of the soviet union and 
that he would try to settle his jurisdictional disputes with 
president mikhail gorbachev 
yeltsins remarks came a day after he met behind closed doors 
for four hours with gorbachev his longtime political rival 
previous agreements between the leaders have broken down and 
economists said their future cooperation is crucial to solving the 
countrys economic crisis 
speaking to the russian parliaments constitutional commission 
yeltsin emphatically denied that russia the largest of the 15 
soviet republics wants to break up the union 
im for a strong union and union treaty the independent 
interfax news agency quoted him as saying 
gorbachev has been pushing the republics to negotiate a new 
union treaty to transform the country into a confederation of 
sovereign republics such a treaty could slow or perhaps even halt 
the rapid fragmentation that began with lithuanias declaration of 
independence last march 
while yeltsin reiterated his desire for a new treaty he 
insisted russia and the central government must first decide who 
controls the republics banking system natural resources money 
supply and foreign currency earnings 
they pressed us yesterday and earlier first to sign a union 
treaty and then resolve remaining issues in the meantime 
transferring everything to the authority of the center he said 
but we couldnt and will not go for that 
yeltsin said he and gorbachev agreed to set up two parallel 
committees to study how to share control over the economy russia 
has been trying to wrest control over banks natural resources and 
other key economic factors so that it can take faster steps toward 
a market system 
the russian parliament has adopted a 500day blueprint for 
switching from central planning to a marketbased economy although 
it formally voted to begin putting the plan into effect nov 1 it 
has been unable to take concrete steps because it lacks clear 
control of prices currency interest rates land and real estate 
gorbachev and the national legislature have approved a slower 
reform plan that skirts some fundamental issues such as whether to 
break up collective farms the president has called for a 
referendum to decide whether to allow private ownership of land 
two of gorbachevs top economic advisers stanislav shatalin and 
nikolai petrakov joined 11 other economists in an open letter last 
week criticizing gorbachevs tentative reform plan they predicted 
it would increase the budget deficit cause rapid inflation and 
lead to further disintegration of the consumer market already 
marked by shortages of everyday items ranging from gasoline to eggs 
and glass bottles 
yet another leading soviet economist oleg bogomolov criticized 
gorbachevs plan this week as a vague statement of goals rather 
than a map for actual changes 
in an interview published in the weekly magazine ogonyok 
bogomolov said the countrys hopes for emerging from its economic 
crisis rest on cooperation between the center and russia or to 
be more specific between two leaders gorbachev and yeltsin 
ivan silaev prime minister of the russian republic told a news 
conference monday that recent meetings between the republics 
leaders and central government officials have resulted in partial 
agreements on some jurisdictional issues including control over 
foreign currency earnings 
a commentator for the official tass news agency andrei orlov 
wrote monday that gorbachev and yeltsin seem to be doomed to 
cooperation irrespective of their likes and dislikes and their 
political rivalry 
orlov said an agreement in august by the two men to coordinate 
their reforms had fallen apart leaving leadership in disarray as 
the economy worsened and the country approached the brink of an 
abyss 
yeltsin found out that radical reforms were impracticable in 
russia without gorbachevs support as was gorbachevs radical 
transformation of soviet society without russia the tass 
commentator wrote

voting officials said monday that the 
party of yugoslavias reformist premier ante markovic held a 
slight edge over the governing communists in unofficial returns 
from free elections in macedonia 
markovics alliance of reformist forces advocates market 
economics and keeping this fragile balkan federation of six 
republics united 
western observer teams expressed general satisfaction with 
sundays voting but the state tanjug news agency reported later 
that irregularities led election officials to annul results in some 
districts and that 25000 people gathered near skopje to protest 
alleged attempts to keep them from voting 
initial counting has indicated that markovic is just ahead of 
the communists said an official of the state electoral 
commission who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he could not provide specific figures 
i have indications that the party is doing excellently 
stojan andov the chief of the alliance in macedonia said in an 
interview an aide said andov himself won a seat from the capital 
skopje with 73 percent of the vote 
the polling in the southern republic yugoslavias poorest was 
viewed as a crucial test for markovic whose party was competing in 
an election for the first time 
a good showing will boost its chances in elections in the states 
of bosniahercegovina montenegro and serbia in the next weeks 
tanjug said results were annulled in five districts because of 
reported irregularities more invalidations probably will follow 
new voting was expected in the districts affected 
the agency quoted electoral commission president velko paunovski 
as saying irregularities included unlisted voters keeping citizens 
from casting ballots a shortage of ballots and the like 
in tetovo about 30 miles southwest of skopje 25000 
macedonians rallied complaining of voting interference by ethnic 
albanians tanjug did not report any violence 
markovics personal popularity grew steadily after he became 
federal premier in march 1989 but his reforms and efforts to 
preserve the federation have been undermined by political 
squabbling and increasing ethnic tensions 
official results were not expected until thursday runoff 
elections will be held nov 25 in districts where no one received 
50 percent of the vote 
turnout was estimated at 75 percent of the 137 million eligible 
voters among macedonias 22 million population 
skopje tv reported that petar gosev leader of the former 
communist party recently renamed the party of democratic change 
won a majority in his skopje district 
gosev supports markovics policies and says he would be prepared 
to form a coalition with markovics party in runoff elections 
a coalition of four nationalist rightwing parties charged 
there was widespread electoral fraud sunday and demanded the 
election be declared invalid 
public opinion polls had indicated the parties probably would 
fare poorly in the balloting 
another contender was the mainly ethnic albanian party of 
democratic prosperity people of albanian origin account for more 
than 20 percent of macedonias population 
western observers said the elections were free and fair 
we were very positively very favorably impressed by the 
fairness of the elections and by the confident manner in which they 
were carried out declared david evans a senior adviser to a 
us congressional commission overseeing human rights and security 
in europe 
markovics reforms including privatization and the lifting of 
import and foreign investment restrictions have angered the 
hardline leadership of communistled serbia the largest yugoslav 
state 
serbias staterun press has accused him of being a western 
agent and of wanting to turn yugoslavia into a banana republic 
the noncommunist governments in croatia and slovenia which 
advocate transforming yugoslavia into a loose association of 
nearindependent states are wary of markovics insistence on 
keeping yugoslavia a federation

a son of a 69yearold woman facing a 
possible death sentence for plotting with her husband to kill five 
men testified monday his father dominated his mother and treated 
her worse than trash 
a defense attorney asked a jury to spare faye copelands life 
because of the abuse a prosecutor said she deserved to die for the 
killings which were part of a cattle swindle 
the same jury that convicted mrs copeland of five counts of 
firstdegree murder saturday was expected to decide tuesday between 
the death penalty and life in prison the jury heard testimony from 
17 witnesses monday 
mrs copeland could become the oldest person to get the death 
penalty since it was reinstated in missouri in 1977 she was 
accused of plotting the murders of the five transients with her 
husband to conceal a cattletheft scheme 
also tuesday a psychologist is expected to testify about 
batteredwife syndrome that testimony was not allowed during the 
trial 
mrs copelands 75yearold husband ray copeland faces trial 
on similar charges on jan 24 but first must be found mentally 
competent by the court his attorneys claim he is senile 
prosecutors claim copeland was the trigger man 
a daughterinlaw bonnie copeland who lived nearby testified 
that copeland never physically struck his wife 
but another daughter said he dominated mrs copeland and her six 
children he told us exactly what to do and when to do it said 
betty lou gibson of richfield ky there was no discussion that 
was it 
mrs copeland idolized her husband mrs gibson said she 
like us kids knew her place she shut up she said

heard her father say he loved her mother 
a son al copeland of chillicothe said he and a brother 
approached their father in 1986 when the elder copelands were on 
the verge of bankruptcy he said they offered financial help but 
ray copeland responded stay out of my damned business 
he said his father treated his mother a lot worse than 
trash 
my father tried to dominate me and my family in lifestyle and 
work al copeland said 
the defense claimed mrs copeland did not take part in the 
murders and was unaware of her husbands business dealings 
but livingston county prosecutor doug roberts called the 
copelands 20thcentury cattle rustlers who made 32000 through 
their scheme 
if we dont seek the death penalty after one of the worst if 
not the worst cases of serial murder in the states history when 
do we seek it he asked 
roberts said the copelands who lived on a small farm near 
chillicothe about 90 miles northeast of kansas city had the five 
victims write bad checks to buy cattle then resold the cattle 
kept the proceeds and killed the men before the checks could be 
traced 
the mens bodies were found in october 1989 near farms where 
copeland had done odd jobs after a tip from another drifter who

the governing party claimed overwhelming 
victories in two major state elections that tested its promise of 
electoral reform but the opposition charged the party resorted 
once again to fraud 
abstention appeared to be the biggest factor in sundays 
elections for 121 city hall slates and 34 local congressional 
district seats in mexico state 
about 70 percent of the voters either stayed home or passed by 
the polls on their way to soccer games movies or drives in the 
country the low turnout favors the ruling institutional 
revolutionary party which has superior resources to mobilize its 
supporters 
mexico state which includes many of this vast capitals suburbs 
rich poor and middle class is the countrys wealthiest and 
most populous state with more than 10 million people and 45 
million voters 
president carlos salinas de gortari was soundly defeated there 
during 1988 elections 
for opposition parties the election tests salinas promises to 
reform the ruling partys muchmaligned electoral practices 
the ruling party known by its spanish initials pri had 
controlled all but two of the 121 city halls in the state before 
the election 
early monday it claimed to have won in 119 municipalities 
including naucalpan the richest in the country it did not give 
the names of the towns it lost 
the party also claimed victory in 22 of the 84 city hall races 
in neighboring hidalgo state which has about 1 million voters the 
status of the other towns wasnt immediately known 
no results were available from the congressional elections 
mexicos congress has little power 
official results in both states will be announced sunday 
the voting in mexico state was characterized by minor clashes 
between sympathizers of different parties late openings at some 
polling places and at least one report of a stolen ballot box 
the conservative national action party or pan by its spanish 
initials charged the pri was using terrible fraud to take 
naucalpan a northwest mexico city suburb with a population of 
800000 
definitely there was fraud the elections were not fair 
said luis felipe bravo pans mayoral candidate 
the centerleft democratic revolutionary party founded by 
dissident pri leaders also claimed the pri used intimidation to 
win naucalpan 
an exit poll done by the private public opinion studies center 
for the newspaper la jornada showed the pri with 36 percent of the 
naucalpan vote and pan with 35 percent it said the poll had a 2 
percent margin of error 
about 200 pan activists blocked the road to the election 
commission offices in the city of cuautitlan demanding a recount 
and refusing to let the ruling party commission chairman leave the 
independent excelsior news service reported 
the commission chairman jesus reyes told excelsior the pans 
mayoral candidate had a 450vote lead over the pri candidate 
cuautitlan a northern suburb has about 50000 residents 
as the ruling party for 61 years the pri has become entrenched 
in power and invariably faces charges of highhanded maneuvering

picking candidates

modernize and recognize electoral victories by the opposition

authorities in the 
bophuthatswana black homeland on monday detained at least 32 
members of the african national congress in a crackdown that 
coincided with a work boycott by ancaffiliated groups 
homeland president lucas mangope accused the anc of plotting to 
kill him and overthrow the government a charge the anc dismissed 
as absurd 
it said the crackdown was part of a pattern of repression going 
on in bophuthatswana 
thousands of blacks stayed home from work monday in pretoria 
the south african capital to protest electricity cuts in nearby 
black townships 
authorities shut off electricity last week because residents 
refused to pay their bills to protest living conditions 
police said seven blacks died in scattered violence in 
johannesburg area including five in a faction fight in katlehong 
township to the southeast 
organizers said the oneday work boycott also was designed to 
express opposition to the government in bophuthatswana near 
pretoria 
activists consider south africas 10 tribal homelands part of 
the apartheid system of racial segregation they want the four 
homelands with nominal independence transkei ciskei venda and 
bophuthatswana to be reincorporated into south africa 
mangope refuses to consider rejoining south africa despite 
mounting opposition to his rule 
he claimed over staterun radio bophuthatswana he had evidence 
of the alleged anc plot to overthrow the government police 
commissioner maj gen pj seleke said 32 anc members were 
detained monday in response 
it is surely no coincidence that mangopes absurd claim that 
there is an anc plot to assassinate him comes on the day when 
thousands of people have stayed away from work in response to a 
call by ancaffiliated groups an anc statement said 
in transkei ciskei and venda army members have staged coups 
and developed good relations with the anc only south africa 
recognizes the sovereignty of the socalled independent homelands

action forcing shops that employ blacks to rely on white staff

manuel noriega and cable news network declared a 
ceasefire monday agreeing to postpone their constitutional 
showdown over taped conversations until the us supreme court 
rules on the issue 
under the deal is worked out in federal court cnn must refrain 
from playing any tapes between the imprisoned former panamanian 
leader and his attorneys 
in return noriegas defense delayed a request for contempt 
penalties of up to 300000 per broadcast against the network us 
district judge william hoeveler also delayed his order demanding 
that cnn hand over seven disputed tapes to the court 
our concern is to keep general noriega from being denied a 
fair trial defense attorney jon may said im not here to 
squeeze blood out of cnn 
he said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the 
supreme court to focus on the broader constitutional question 
balancing protections of the attorneyclient privilege and freedom 
of speech 
noriegas attorneys saturday asked the judge to find cnn in 
contempt after the network defied his court order and televised a 
contested tape 
cnn attorney terry bienstock said the network accepted the deal 
but had the right to play other noriega tapes as long as they did 
not include conversations with his attorneys the judge agreed 
the atlantabased network is expected to file its appeal to the 
supreme court later in the week a cnn spokesman said 
we agreed that cnn would not air pending supreme court 
review any attorneyclient conversations that it has in its 
possession network attorney terry bienstock said we just want 
the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the supreme 
court 
federal prosecutors have remained on the sidelines during the 
cnnnoriega dispute but us attorney dexter lehtinen said monday 
he supports the gag order 
these tapes should not be played under the fairtrial 
concept lehtinen told the judge 
may said mondays deal stops the clock on the contempt 
penalties but does not prevent the defense from later asking for 
fines against cnn 
although attention has focused on the media may said there are 
also other potential parties to the dispute 
theres a whole bunch of people in the us who may have these 
tapes including the state department and the cia he said lead 
noriega attorney frank rubino has said the tapes were leaked to cnn 
by a panamanian official who received them from the state 
department 
rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges 
against noriega based on government misconduct in recording the 
calls made from the metropolitan correctional center 
hoeveler endorsed the deal but took note of cnns oneday 
defiance of his previous gag order he emphasized that over the 
weekend the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta backed 
his original ban on broadcasting the conversations 
if you play any tapes in violation of my order you are 
violating not only my order but also the appeals court order 
hoeveler said 
cnn had defied the order by broadcasting an excerpt friday night 
and saturday in which the deposed panamanian ruler spoke in spanish 
with a secretary for rubino on the tape noriega speculated that 
the government would use as witnesses against him two men who 
surrendered to us troops in panama 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel he has been held near miami 
since his surrender to us forces shortly after the invasion of 
panama in december

former attorney general ramsey clark met 
monday with iraqi president saddam hussein who told clark he hoped 
there would be no showdown with the united states the iraqi news 
agency said 
saddam also told clark we should all work for the sake of 
peace the official agency said 
clark who said he came here for three days to learn iraqs 
position and to help win the release of hostages also met with 
senior figures from the ruling baath party including deputy prime 
minister taha hussein ramadan 
his antiwar statements were given extensive coverage on iraqi 
television and in local newspapers it was the first visit by a 
recognized us figure since jesse jackson came here in august 
i am here to impress the government that the people who want 
to leave should be able to do so i have a civil rights background 
and i think violation of individual rights could create tensions 
and difficulties clark said 
it is an inflammable issue if you want peace you should value 
everyones rights he said 
he said the us government was rushing to a military solution 
and should try negotiations 
unwillingness to talk is never acceptable you must not lose 
complete communication with an enemy because ignorance can cause

a detective said monday that the 
suitcase holding the bomb that brought down pan am flight 103 in 
december 1988 could not be matched to any of the passengers aboard 
det constable derek henderson said the suitcase probably was on 
the flight when it left frankfurt germany 
the boeing 747 blew up over lockerbie scotland killing 270 
people on board the craft and in the town 
henderson said investigators set about matching passengers to 
all the bags in baggage container ave 4041 which contained the 
bomb 
he testified at a fatal accident inquiry presided over by lord 
fraser the lord advocate of scotland that one item listed was a 
bronze samsonite suitcase that inquiries among relatives failed to 
match to any passenger 
the conclusion i would draw is that the suitcase containing 
the ied improvised explosive device came from the feeder flight 
103a from frankfurt he said 
henderson also testified that no drugs were found in the luggage 
of passenger khalid jaafar 21 of suburban detroit who was 
returning from lebanon 
reports on nbc and abc television last month said terrorists may 
have penetrated a drug enforcement administration undercover 
investigation to put explosives on the flight 
the networks said terrorists might have substituted baggage 
containing bombs for suitcases loaded with heroin that dea placed 
on usbound planes to track the routes of lebanese drug 
traffickers smuggling drugs to detroit 
bags belonging to us passengers charles mckee and matthew 
gannon who flew into frankfurt from cyprus were unlikely to have 
been switched either henderson said 
it was earlier suggested at the inquiry that mckee and gannon 
may have been cia agents

the way denys arcand tells it his awardwinning 
films like the decline of the american empire were just a 
diversion this week he debuts in the role he always wanted stage 
director 
the theater has been a sort of secret love of mine 
forever said arcand 49 as he dug into his fastfood chicken 
lunch in the lobby of theatre de quatsous where les lettres de la 
religieuse portugaise the portuguese nuns letters was opening 
monday night 
i think i see more plays in a year than movies really its 
not that i dont like movies but good ones are few and far 
between he said 
as a history graduate from the university of montreal denys 
first job was as a researcher at the national film board later he 
began making documentary films about such topics as the textile 
industry municipal politics and life in a strip joint 
his first dramatic film was released in 1986 the decline of 
the american empire a treatise on the sexual obsessions of 
middleclass intellectuals won numerous awards as did his 1989 
film jesus of montreal 
most of the cast of jesus was drawn from the ranks of the 
montreal theater scene arcand said i think theater is the art 
form that is most alive in quebec he said 
les lettres de la religieuse portugaise is shaped around the 
apparently genuine letters written by a portuguese woman to the 
french lieutenant who left her the letters were published 
anonymously in 1669

former prime minister david lange 
said tuesday that all 16 new zealand hostages in iraq and occupied 
kuwait will be released 
at a news conference at parliament lange joined by relatives 
of some of those held said the hostages six in iraq and 10 in 
kuwait will assemble in baghdad and then travel to amman jordan 
he said it would probably take two days 
it was just before i left from singapore that i heard it from 
baghdad he said 
lange had a short stay in singapore on his return to new 
zealand 
he said sunday night before leaving amman that he was told by 
iraqs first deputy prime minister taha yassin ramadan to expect 
good news on his return to new zealand 
in iraq lange held talks with ramadan no 3 in the iraqi 
government and national assembly speaker saadi mehdi saleh 
lange went to iraq following a plea by the families of new 
zealanders who were trapped when iraqi forces invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 
the former labor prime minister told radio new zealand on monday 
that adverse reaction from the united states about his visit was a 
great help in his negotiations 
the united states has complained that the stream of senior 
statesmen pleading for the release of their nationals was a 
propaganda victory for president saddam hussein 
asked if he had any qualms about the propaganda potential of 
such visits to baghdad lange responded 
one of the curious things about the united states is that it 
criticized my visit which was a great help in baghdad 
the other thing is the argument of the united states that the 
hostages in iraq are a potential deterrent to the use of force by 
the united states and associated troops it therefore seems quite 
extraordinary that they should protest against the removal of 
them 
lange arrived home tuesday in time for the release of a book he 
has written on new zealands antinuclear policy which caused a 
rift in relations with washington in 1986

three strikes doesnt mean youre out to former 
mayor jane byrne who on monday became the first announced 
candidate for mayor next year 
byrne who served as mayor from 1979 to 1983 but lost her last 
three political races likely will challenge firstterm mayor 
richard m daley in the citys democratic primary next feb 5 
daley hasnt announced his intentions but is expected to seek 
reelection many observers regard him as unbeatable 
byrne 56 told a news conference that daley hides from 
responsibility while rising crime a poorly run public health 
system and high taxes tarnish chicagos reputation as an attractive 
place to live and do business 
instead of a leader in city hall we have a person who hides 
from responsibility blames others such as the federal government 
and speaks to us in nothing more than 30second sound bites in a 
carefully controlled and screened setting as if everything is 
rosy she said 
but experts say the future in running this city of 3 million 
people is indeed rosy for the son of mayor richard j daley 
the current mayor daley 47 won a twoyear term in a 1989 
special election to fill the remainder of the late harold 
washingtons term 
a chicago suntimes poll published nov 1 found 58 percent of 
chicagoans rated daleys job performance as excellent or good the 
poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points 
republican gov james r thompson predicted last week that daley 
would be reelected 
and political analyst don rose who ran byrnes winning 1979 
campaign said she lacks the support to win this time 
i think there is a very general sense that daley is unbeatable 
in 1991 rose said 
byrne was eliminated in the 1983 mayoral primary when with 
daley she split the white vote and washington the third primary 
candidate went on to become the citys first black mayor byrne 
lost to washington in the 1987 primary 
she also lost a primary bid in 1988 for clerk of thecook county 
circuit court

police and volunteers flying in 
glider planes hang gliders and helicopters tossed millions of tree 
and plant seeds into brazils atlantic forest to reforest rios 
ravaged wilderness 
about 92 million seeds were dropped sunday from 40 helicopters 
and 12 glider planes and hang gliders into three of rios national 
forests to begin the citys dress rio in green environmental 
campaign 
the 320000 campaign was planned shortly after rio was chosen 
as the host city of the 1992 united nations world environment 
conference 
the seeds donated by the sao paulo forestry institute are 
expected to form a lower brush cover needed for such native 
brazilian trees as the jequitibas and peroba to grow quickly 
we dont know up to what point this will bring practical 
results but it sure is worth the effort said abelardo coimbra 
bueno 26 who flew his hang glider over rios mountains to drop 
dozens of sacks of seeds into forest clearings 
five people in hang gliders soared over rios mountaintop tijuca 
forest and dumped nearly 1 million seeds into the worlds largest

police on monday arrested 10 greenpeace activists 
for hanging a banner atop tower bridge to protest british plans to 
conduct nuclear tests in nevada 
the activists included five people who held the safety ropes and 
five others who were suspended 140 feet above the thames river to 
hang the enormous banner reading stop uk nuclear tests 
greenpeace expected the group to be charged with disturbing the 
peace 
the british environmental group said it received leaked 
information last weekend that the test would be conducted 
underground wednesday 
the defense ministry said only we dont say anything about 
testing beforehand 
but in las vegas the us department of energy on monday 
confirmed plans for the eighth announced test this year 
doe spokesman jim boyer said the 20150 kiloton weapon would be 
exploded at 9 am wednesday about 1900 feet beneath the surface 
of pahute mesa about 105 miles northwest of las vegas he would 
not say whether britain was involved in the test 
in the last british test in december xenon and krypton gas and 
a small amount of radioactivity leaked into the atmosphere 
according to the energy department the explosion monitored at the 
california institute of technology seismology laboratory in 
pasadena calif created a shock measuring 54 on the richter 
scale 
the defense ministry said monday there was a minor seepage 
about eight days after the explosion the spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the leak was not unusual and that it 
did not constitute a health hazard on or off the test site 
nevada gov bob miller has complained about the energy 
departments delay in reporting leaks to the people of his state 
the department recently agreed to report all leaks no matter how 
small 
britain has conducted 17 nuclear tests in nevada since signing a 
1958 agreement with the united states 
we obviously feel that us citizens should not be put 
downwind of the british nuclear program said rebecca johnson 
the greenpeace test ban coordinator that is exactly what is 
happening as shown by last years test 
greenpeace also expressed anger at the timing of the british 
test weeks before a conference in new york to discuss a worldwide 
ban on underground nuclear testing 
forty nonaligned nations out of 118 countries that have signed 
the partial test ban treaty have called the meeting for jan 78 
under the auspices of the united nations the treaty first signed 
in 1963 bans tests in the atmosphere underwater and in outer 
space but permits underground testing 
the nations gathering in new york hope to convince the united 
states britain and the soviet union to ban underground tests us 
and british officials oppose the ban the soviets have said they 
will not unilaterally end the testing

hundreds of masked youths battled police and set 30 
cars ablaze monday as police in paris blocked the route of more 
than 100000 students demanding better conditions at their high 
schools 
it was the worst violence in a month of nationwide student 
protests 
riot police fired water cannons and hundreds of rounds of tear 
gas at demonstrators who pelted officers with rocks and bottles 
smashed windows and looted stores 
police headquarters said 104 officers were hurt including 18 
hospitalized police reported 52 arrests in paris and a dozen 
youths arrested for vandalism during a protest march in 
montbelaird eastern france 
in all about 100 vehicles were damaged in paris police said 
about 150000 students took part in demonstrations elsewhere in 
france 
president francois mitterrand promised steps would be taken to 
address student demands they want more government spending to 
improve security upgrade substandard facilities modernize 
curricula and hire more teachers 
the main throng of protesters in paris was orderly but hundreds 
of youths on the fringes ran wild many rioters wore masks and 
carried clubs 
journalists were beaten 
mitterrand and education minister lionel jospin met with a 
delegation of student leaders and promised an emergency plan in 
response to demands for better education and safety on campus 
mondays march began at the place de la bastille in eastern 
paris where 201 years ago rioters stormed the prison to start the 
french revolution in the montparnasse neighborhood of southern 
paris gangs started smashing windows and robbing street vendors 
about two hours after the march started 
police chief pierre verbrugghe who deployed 5000 officers 
told students they would not be allowed to follow their planned 
route and finish their march on the champs elysees 
many students obeyed the orders but a few hundred youths 
squared off against police at the alma bridge police fired water 
cannons when they tried to cross scattering the rioters who hurled 
rocks and trash 
the youths regrouped and repeated attempts to break through 
police line vandals set fire to trash and dismantled bus stops 
jospin promised more discussions with student leaders tuesday 
and throughout the week and said such talks should be held on the 
local level as well 
organizers claimed 200000 students joined the paris march but 
other observers estimated the turnout at closer to 100000 it was 
the first time students from the provinces were urged to join a 
march in the capital 
those who couldnt come to paris staged their own protests in 
dozens of smaller cities 
dozens of previous student marches and rallies across france 
over the past four weeks have been peaceful except for sporadic 
vandalism blamed by student leaders on provocateurs 
on nov 5 an estimated 150000 students participated in marches 
nationwide 
the protests began with student strikes last month in the tough 
northern suburbs of paris after the gang rape of a girl in a school 
lavatory and assaults on teachers protesters have complained of 
drug trafficking theft and extortion on campus 
most protesters come from relatively lowincome families and 
many are children of immigrants they view education as the key to 
advancement and resent a seemingly secondclass treatment of 
schools in the highrise slums that ring many major cities 
im from a bourgeois neighborhood so our problems with 
security and infrastructure are not that great said marcher 
fabien liabastre 16 of sceaux but even our school has wire 
hanging out of the wall and water leaks throughout the ceiling 
the students have broad public support and the government has 
proposed increasing the education budget by 9 percent in 1991 but 
students worry that improvements wont come quickly enough to help 
them win university admission or decent jobs

a drug being given to postmenopausal women along 
with the hormone estrogen could be undercutting the beneficial 
effects of estrogen on the heart doctors said monday 
dr elizabeth barrettconnor of the university of california 
san diego said that uncertainty surrounds the use of progestin in 
women receiving estrogen therapy after menopause 
progestin is a drug with the same action as the naturally 
occurring hormone progesterone 
rampratap s kushwaha of the southwest foundation for biomedical 
research in san antonio reported that progestin boosted cholesterol 
levels in baboons whose ovaries had been removed 
estrogen and progesterone are the two main hormones produced in 
the ovaries and production of both drops almost to zero after 
menopause 
estrogen is given to help reduce the hot flashes caused by the 
loss of the hormone production since the 1970s when it was shown 
that giving a woman estrogen could increase her risk of uterine 
cancer progesterone has been used to reduce that cancer risk 
barrettconnor said 
but estrogen also protects women against heart disease without 
estrogen their risk of heart disease climbs sharply after 
menopause becoming similar to that of men after a few years 
barrettconnor was one of several researchers who called for 
more research on heart disease in women 
at a news conference during the annual scientific meeting of the 
american heart association the researchers said that many 
questions such as how to use estrogen and progesterone in 
postmenopausal women cant be answered without new studies 
barrettconnor said for example that older women have higher 
blood pressure and cholesterol on average than do men but they 
still have lower risks of heart disease researchers do not know 
why 
john larosa of george washington university medical center said 
the fat that women often carry on their hips may raise their heart 
disease risk less than fat carried around the abdomen as is more 
common in men 
charles hennekens of harvard medical school cautioned however 
that obesity in women is a major public health problem 
a woman who is 10 percent above average weight has an 80 percent 
higher risk of heart disease he said a woman who is 20 percent 
above average weight has a 230 percent higher risk of heart 
disease

playboy is not on the list but bowling 
digest is so is life snowmobile and football card magazine 
concerned that some reading material sent to troops in saudi 
arabia is not making it through saudi customs publisher timothy 
karnes decided to do something about it 
so karnes who publishes auction guide magazine has organized 
operation desert news a nonprofit effort to get magazines to the 
troops 
working with the defense department and magazine publishers 
hes making plans to ship thousands of magazines directly to forces 
in saudi arabia late this month 
the publications have been screened by the military to make sure 
the contents are not offensive to the saudis references to 
alcohol articles on religious beliefs and photos of women that 
show a lot of skin are all considered objectionable 
what to you is a woman in a bathing suit or a man in a bathing 
suit is pornography to them said maj lon oakley of the public 
affairs office of the us central command at macdill air force 
base in tampa fla 
current issues of 31 magazines have been cleared for shipment 
some are production overruns karnes said 
the magazines will be given new covers decorated in camouflage 
and bearing the names of corporate sponsors who are helping finance 
the project the new covers will prevent the magazines from being 
resold on the black market karnes said 
i got the idea a couple of months ago that maybe magazines 
that were going to be destroyed by the publishers could be sent 
over there he said 
publications approved for shipment include adventure comics 
bowling digest baseball america inside sports life the nation 
space cadet world monitor and snowmobile 
snowmobile doesnt have a lot of women showing a lot of 
skin karnes said 
karnes hopes the first shipment of about 200000 magazines will 
be ready late this month some publishers he said have even 
agreed to make additional production runs to help the effort 
auction guide is a magazine about auctions in the southeast and 
is sold on newsstands in seven states karnes said

a vietnam veterans group in florida 
said monday it has lost patience with federal government efforts to 
study the effects of agent orange and will conduct its own survey 
on exposure to the toxic defoliant 
this state the vietnam veterans of florida have said 
enough is enough said david kaufman a veteran from fort 
lauderdale were going to take the bull by the horns 
florida with about 527000 vietnam veterans is the first state 
to attempt such a project according to kaufman chairman of the 
agent orange committee of the vietnam veterans of florida 
the survey has the backing of national vietnam veterans groups 
and individual scientists at the department for veterans affairs 
the environmental protection agency and the centers for disease 
control kaufman said 
there are scientists and epidemiolgists who work for the va 
and the epa who are outraged at this latest cdc fiasco kaufman 
told reporters 
a congressional study released last month charged that the cdc 
misspent 66 million while conducting a disputed study of the 
effects of agent orange 
an estimated 12 million gallons of agent orange composed 
primarily of cancercausing dioxin was sprayed over vietnam by 
us troops between 1965 and 1970 to destroy the jungle that hid 
the enemy 
veterans groups say exposure to agent orange has been linked to 
19 types of cancer and other health problems including birth 
defects earlier this year the va decided to award compensation to 
veterans with two rare cancers softtissue sarcoma and 
nonhodgkins lymphoma linked to agent orange 
since 1981 some lowerincome veterans who believe their health 
problems are caused by agent orange have received va care the va 
said 
but the veterans are a long way from getting the government to 
acknowledge that agent orange has caused lingering diseases in 
veterans and birth defects in their children veterans groups say 
the cdc has said that military records did not identify veterans 
who had been exposed to the chemical 
were going to provide them with information kaufman said 
he said there are 116 scientists from the va cdc and epa who 
have pledged that if we get them the surveys they will go through 
them those scientists whom kaufman would not name also helped 
write the 116question survey he said 
the organization has printed only 1000 surveys thus far it 
wants to get 500000 distributed and returned within six months 
kaufman said it will cost about 3 million to conduct the survey 
and that veterans would have to raise money as they go to pay for 
the project 
about 200 surveys were handed out monday to veterans gathered 
for veterans day ceremonies at the groups tallahassee 
headquarters kaufman said

doctors conducted lab tests monday to 
determine what caused the sudden death of 13yearold stormie 
jones the worlds first heartliver transplant recipient 
it will take one to two weeks to complete the tests including 
organ tissue cultures to search for viruses or bacteria said lynn 
mcmahon a spokeswoman at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
stormie went into cardiac arrest and died sunday morning at the 
hospital after rapidly declining during the night 
she endured organ rejection and hepatitis after her historic 
double transplant on valentines day 1984 and a second liver 
transplant in february 
weve been able to provide better quality of life and longer 
life for many people because of stormies ordeal dr jorge 
reyes staff physician at childrens hospital of pittsburgh said 
after she died 
preliminary autopsy results were inconclusive but reyes said 
that if stormie had a flu virus her death could have been caused 
by a rapid or irregular heartbeat 
transplant patients are susceptible to infection because 
antirejection drugs to protect the transplant weaken the immune 
system 
stormie was taken from her home in white settlement texas a 
fort worth suburb to a texas hospital saturday night with a sore 
throat and fever she then was flown to the pittsburgh hospital 
which had conducted the transplants 
her condition did not appear serious then but it deteriorated 
rapidly ms mcmahon said 
stormie was known for her generosity to other patients at 
childrens hospital where ms mcmahon said it was really very 
solemn monday 
theres still a great deal of shock ms mcmahon said 
she went through a lot of pain you know as a guinea pig and 
as necessity her stepfather alan purcell said at dallasfort 
worth international airport en route to pittsburgh the pain is 
over with she doesnt hurt any more 
purcell told hospital officials monday that stormies mother 
lois purcell was holding up despite her grief said sue 
cardillo another hospital spokeswoman 
ms cardillo said stormies body was not being held for further 
autopsy but she did not know whether the body had been returned to 
texas 
students at brewer middle school in white settlement mourned 
their classmate who had attended class there a few weeks in the 
fall before being forced home by medical problems 
the students decided to rename the gymnasium the stormie jones 
gym and to hang her portrait in the hallway an oak tree was 
planted in front of the school monday as a living memorial to the 
seventhgrader 
stormie was 6 when she became the first person to receive a 
transplanted heart and liver at the same time since then 
university of pittsburgh hospitals have performed at least 10 other 
transplants involving the liver and another organ 
most multipleorgan transplants in the united states have been 
performed at the universitys hospitals the only ones authorized 
to use fk506 the experimental antirejection drug stormie was 
taking 
stormie required the first multiple transplant because her own 
organs were harmed by familial hypercholesterolemia a condition 
in which her body produced blood cholesterol at a rate 10 times 
higher than normal 
funeral arrangements were pending a memorial service will be 
held at the hospital nov 21 ms mcmahon said

summit within the next week as a last chance for peace some 
nations endorsed that call and saddam said he might attend if 
consulted on the timing and agenda 
saddam said the summit should discuss linking the arabisraeli 
dispute to any decision over kuwait which iraq invaded and 
occupied on aug 2 in a dispute over land oil and money 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization and chinese foreign minister qian qichen meeting 
monday in baghdad backed the call for an arab summit 
but several arab leaders had not responded and prospects for an 
early summit seemed dim 
the last arab summit in august ended in disarray mubarak last 
week rejected a proposal by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
for an arab summit saying the arabs were too divided to hold a 
productive session 
also controversial was saddams insistence on tying his 
withdrawal from kuwait to withdrawal of israel from the west bank 
and gaza strip the united states and its allies have said iraq 
must withdraw unconditionally from kuwait and the issues must be 
dealt with separately 
in dhahran saudi arabia secretarygeneral abdullah bishara of 
the sixnation gulf cooperation council said moroccos call for an 
emergency arab summit came too late 
bishara a kuwaiti national told a news conference war was 
inescapable because diplomacy alone will never achieve its 
objectives 
he said war was the only language the iraqis understood 
the council groups kuwait saudi arabia qatar bahrain the 
united arab emirates and oman 
new zealands former prime minister david lange said tuesday 
that all 16 new zealand hostages in iraq and kuwait will be 
released probably within two days 
lange spoke at a news conference in wellington after returning 
from talks in baghdad he told radio new zealand on monday that 
us criticism of his trip was a great help in his negotiations 
in the iraqi capital 
washington says the stream of senior statesmen pleading for the 
release of their citizens is a propaganda victory for saddam 
the united nations imposed trade sanctions on iraq to force its 
withdrawal from kuwait but two middle east experts in washington 
said it was unlikely sanctions alone would work 
in a report for the washington institute for near east policy 
patrick clawson said he believed iraq could survive sanctions 
through late 1991 
james a phillips of the heritage foundation said that for 
saddam withdrawal would mean a humiliating defeat that will 
threaten his personal power and perhaps survival 
the united states has deployed 230000 troops in saudi arabia as 
part of a more than 300000strong multinational force arrayed 
against iraq and bush last week announced plans to send about 
200000 more soldiers 
when secretary of state james a baker iii visited cairo last 
week a senior us official said the united states was confident 
egypt would fight alongside us forces if war broke out 
but asked by his partys newspaper mayo if egypt would send 
troops to iraq following a usled attack mubarak said 
no we have nothing to do with iraq but if the antiiraq 
allies invaded kuwait he said we do not mind at all entering 
kuwait as peacekeeping forces although i do not hope for this 
day at all 
following bushs announcement the tone in congress shifted from 
cautious support to apprehension 
democratic sen wyche fowler said monday in albany ga that 
congress should reconvene after thanksgiving to debate the issue 
and to better define americas goals 
moynihan warned bush against any us attack on iraq without 
congress sanction 
he will wreck our military he will wreck his administration 
and hell spoil a chance to get a collective security system 
working moynihan said of bush 
americas roman catholic bishops at the opening session of 
their annual fall meeting also called for strong limitations on 
any use of military force

opponents of a paid martin luther king holiday 
for state employees promised monday they would take out recall 
petitions against any lawmakers who try to pass a king holiday 
without submitting it to voters 
two king day holiday measures were defeated in last weeks 
election and the states pocketbook is already taking the strain 
tour groups have canceled reservations for conventions or stays at 
hotels in protest and football authorities have recommended moving 
the 1993 super bowl to another state 
democratic gov rose mofford said through a spokesman that she 
would consider calling a special session of the lameduck 
legislature if lawmakers assure her they will pass the king holiday 
by a twothirds vote and thereby block any chance at another public 
referendum 
that is nothing more or less than the mentality of a banana 
republic said tempe architect julian sanders a leading king day 
opponent the american democratic process is we go to the 
polls and accept the will of the majority 
other king day opponents calling themselves the nono 
committee said they were willing to support a civil rights day if 
voters got the final say but would oppose any holiday with kings 
name attached to it 
anything short of a vote by the people is immoral and 
illegal committee chairman bob rose said 
arizona law gives voters the right to gather signatures and 
demand a referendum on most bills that clear the legislature the 
legislature can abridge that right if 20 members of the 30member 
senate and 40 members of the 60member house agree that it is an 
emergency measure 
supporters of the paid holiday have never had twothirds support 
for any of their proposals in the past but mofford press secretary 
vada manager said monday that mrs mofford believes lame duck 
lawmakers who have retired or been defeated might be more willing 
to vote for the holiday now knowing that they no longer face the 
wrath of voters 
mrs mofford also believes that some lawmakers may change their 
minds and support the holiday because the economic effects of not 
having one are expected to be devastating manager added 
there is now a domino effect of lost tourism lost conventions 
and a lost super bowl he said were taking a beating 
nationally imagewise 
national football league commissioner paul tagliabue said 
wednesday he will recommend that the leagues owners move the 1993 
super bowl from phoenix because of the king vote the governor has 
estimated that losing the super bowl would cost arizona 200 
million in lost revenue fiesta bowl officials met monday to decide 
which schools to invite to the jan 1 game at tempe ariz now 
that virginia and notre dame have turned down invitations because 
of the states stance on the civil rights leader 
arizona already has an unpaid holiday honoring king but holiday 
supporters have said it is not enough 
when king day supporters got their first holiday through the 
legislature trading in the paid columbus day for a paid king day 
opponents gathered enough signatures to suspend the law until a 
vote could be taken this fall 
lawmakers then approved a second bill canceling the first one 
and creating a paid king holiday while leaving columbus day in 
place opponents gathered enough signatures to place that bill on 
the ballot too 
the kingforcolumbus swap was defeated 7525 last week and the 
kingandcolumbus bill was defeated about 5149 
sanders and rose said they and other opponents of the holiday 
were motivated by specific disagreements with king not by racial 
prejudice 
arizonans dont want a holiday in his honor said rose who 
describes himself as hispanic 
i oppose a lot of the things that martin luther king did but 
not concerning civil rights rose said he was an immoral 
man 
rose and sanders both cited disclosures that king may have 
plagiarized school work and longstanding complaints that fbi files 
on king remained under seal 
new hampshire and montana are the only states without any kind 
of king holiday most other states have a paid holiday although 
some dont celebrate it every year or make it one of several 
options from which state workers may choose

shadowlands a new play by william 
nicholson is tasteful but not terribly exciting theater an 
evening of intellectual soap opera saved by some superb acting 
the expensivelooking british import which opened over the 
weekend at broadways brooks atkinson theater started life as a 
television drama in england and later was expanded by nicholson 
into a fulllength play its broadcast roots show particularly in 
its cuddly almost cute treatment of oxford dons cantankerous yet 
ultimately lovable 
the most appealing of all is cs lewis the shy incredibly 
decent man who wrote the bestselling chronicles of narnia and 
the screwtape letters 
shadowlands tells the story of the tragic love affair 
between lewis and american poet joy davidman a straightforward 
direct woman who was one of his biggest fans and eventually became 
his wife 
they first meet at her request and the acquaintance blossoms 
into friendship and finally after she ends an unhappy marriage 
romance tragedy specifically bone cancer strikes joy just before 
the first act curtain the rest of the play deals with the couples 
attempt to reconcile their love with her pain 
one of the plays main themes is exactly that if god loves 
us why does he allow us to suffer so much lewis asks in the 
opening scene which takes the form of a lecture by the famous 
author 
pain according to lewis is gods megaphone to rouse a deaf 
world without suffering there is no need for god the man says 
were like blocks of stone out of which the sculptor carves 
the forms of men the blows of his chisel which hurt us so much 
are what makes us perfect he adds 
pain pretty much fills act 2 with joy courageously battling the 
disease before finally succumbing her struggle gives lewis a 
chance to practice what he preaches a difficult assignment he 
accomplishes with remarkable if predictable grace 
what validates shadowlands are the performances of nigel 
hawthorne as the goodhearted lewis and jane alexander as joy his 
lateinlife love hawthorne clothed in rumpled corduroy is a 
teddy bear of a man his portrait of lewis neatly juxtaposes the 
mans towering intellectual genius and his innate shyness theres 
a joy in watching this retiring almost lifelong bachelor finally 
admit that he has found love 
alexander has an even harder task but she manages to bring an 
edge to a series of dying and deathbed scenes that could be merely 
soggy and sentimental 
michael allison gives a beautifully drawn performance as warnie 
lewis brother its a secondfiddle role but allison plays it as 
if he were the leader of the band 
the opulent scenery designed by mark thompson is annoyingly 
busy a large translucent screen keeps dropping in front of the 
settings so scenes can be changed but you still can see the actors 
and stagehands working behind it 
director elijah moshinsky cranks the long play up slowly the 
most cartoonish episodes particularly joys dismissal by lewis 
skeptical colleagues flounder but by the time joy dies the play 
has achieved a certain amount of poignancy 
after her death lewis finds solace in his belief in god and the 
knowledge that there is something beyond the here and now this 
world that seems to us so substantial is no more than the 
shadowlands real life has not begun yet he says and when 
hawthorne says it you really do believe him

emperor akihito formally became japans new monarch 
in allday enthronement ceremonies that were marred by dozens of 
terrorist attacks and national tv said tuesday that police fear 
more radical violence is likely 
the rites on monday marked the beginning of nearly a month of 
festivities surrounding japans first coronation in 62 years 
akihito performs the most controversial ritual a communion with 
the gods of shinto on the night of nov 2223 governmentrun 
television said police will review security measures before then 
because their great mobilization on monday failed to stop numerous 
leftist attacks 
the only police reaction was to note that mondays ceremonies 
went off without disruption or delay just one injury was reported 
the enthronement celebrations featuring prayers to the sun 
goddess and other rituals dating to ancient times have drawn 
criticism from groups that believe government funding for them is 
unconstitutional 
many japanese ignored the ceremonies taking advantage of the 
special enthronement day holiday to take weekend trips and crowd 
golf courses and driving ranges 
one poll suggested nearly half of all japanese were not 
interested in the enthronement 
foreign dignitaries traveled from 158 countries for the 
ceremony which un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
called an event of great sobriety and dignity 
the visitors included vice president dan quayle and britains 
prince charles and princess diana 
prime minister toshiki kaifu led more than 2000 guests in three 
cheers of banzai the traditional wish for longeviy kaifu 
said the guests were filled with a mood of celebration 
for the enthronement the 56yearold akihito wore an imperial 
silk kimono in a reddishbrown shade only he is allowed to wear 
and a black crown of ancient design 
he stood under the octagonal canopy of his blacklacquered 
throne facing a palace courtyard filled with attendants carrying 
bows and swords with him inside the palaces hall of pines were 12 
princesses and princes 
empress michiko dressed in an multicolored court gown with her 
face painted white stood motionless at her own throne at 
akihitos side crown prince naruhito dressed in bright orange to 
indicate his status as royal heir stood closest to his fathers 
throne 
the emperor solemnly held aloft the proclamation of his 
coronation and promised to discharge my duties as symbol of the 
state and of the unity of the people under japans postwar 
constitution the constitution changed the imperial role to that of 
a national symbol not sacred sovereign 
later the imperial household gave a banquet for about 350 
guests most of them foreign royalty or government dignitaries the 
menu featured japanese delicacies 
critics say the coronation and its accompanying rites are based 
too closely on the traditional religious rituals used for akihitos 
father the late emperor hirohito who presided during japans 
plunge into militarism and world war ii 
ultraleftist radicals on monday set fires that damaged several 
shinto shrines stopped two train lines and launched mortarstyle 
projectiles at five military bases 
radicals were suspected of involvement in a total of at least 35 
incidents the most ever recorded in a single day 
police said radicals launched 10 projectiles at the palace all 
of them missed and one instead crashed into a locker room at a 
womens university one woman was injured while being evacuated 
from a train 
about 37000 police were mobilized for the ceremonies nearly 
10000 officers were on hand for a 30minute threemile motorcade 
by the imperial couple about 117000 japanese citizens lined the 
route 
during the motorcades journey a string of firecrackers went 
off genshu hanayagi a dancer wellknown for her antimonarchist 
views was arrested in a scuffle that followed she faced charges 
of violating traffic laws 
shortly before the motorcade trip began a 27yearold man 
attempted ritual suicide by slitting his belly with a fruit knife 
in front of the palace the mans motives were not known he was 
admitted to a nearby hospital but officials refused to comment on 
his condition

of ac nielsen co rankings 
asked why viewers did not like his newest show bochco said i

competitive world

expensive show to produce at a news conference a few weeks ago

get the tabloid to readers while its striking employees 
counterattacked with a publication telling their side of the bitter 
dispute

people willing to distribute the paper to come to the news building 
on monday

system she also would not provide circulation figures which 
publisher james hoge said last week was at 400000 daily compared 
to prestrike levels of 109 million 
street hawkers some of them hired from among the homeless were 
seen around manhattan monday at sites where the paper has had 
trouble distributing during the strike many vendors have refused 
to sell it while others claim they have received no deliveries 
the strike began oct 25 after a dispute in which some drivers 
walked off the job the news brought in replacement workers that 
night and said that 60 union drivers were out of a job 
the shutdown spread to other unions which have said the paper 
engaged in unfair labor practices a charge the news denies there 
are about 2100 striking union employees 
the paper has continued to be published by management members 
of the newspaper guild who crossed the picket lines and replacement 
workers 
meanwhile there were reports of violence and intimidation of 
news dealers and union charges that the paper has hired goons and 
thugs to attack them as of sunday the police reported 151 
incidents related to the strike with 74 arrests and four police 
officers injured

rebel leader tin maung win said monday 
that his guerrilla organization has asked burmas largest 
prodemocracy party hard hit by arrests to form a provisional 
government in rebelheld territory 
tin maung win is general secretary of the democratic alliance of 
burma composed of 22 ethnic minority and dissident groups and the 
biggest rebel organization fighting the rangoon government 
he spoke on the eve of a meeting between his alliance and 
members of the national league for democracy 
the league won a big victory in general elections in may but the 
ruling military junta refused to relinquish power last month the 
military arrested four of the leagues few remaining central 
committee members and raided league offices throughout the country 
the military also moved against dissidents among buddhist 
clergy raiding monasteries and arresting monks 
the rebel organization controls about onethird of burma mostly 
areas bordering thailand bangladesh and china 
speaking at the major rebel stronghold of manerplaw along the 
thaiburmese border tin maung win said of his proposal this 
government would only be a temporary one until the nld can stand 
on its own two feet and declare a legitimate government in 
rangoon 
a nationwide prodemocracy movement in burma was bloodily 
crushed by the military in september 1988 aung san suu kyi a 
major figure of that movement and a leader of the league has been 
under house arrest in rangoon since july 1989 
amnesty international the world human rights organization with 
headquarters in london said last week it had reports of widespread 
torture of political detainees in burma a team of un human 
rights investigators left burma on sunday but diplomats stationed 
in rangoon said its activities here were severely restricted by the 
military 
the alliance chief fear exists that the ruling state law and 
order restoration council would totally outlaw the league and so 
it was being offered sanctuary in the liberated zone 
the nld cannot function in rangoon any more let alone form a 
government he told reporters 
the state council has no intention of transferring power 
and continues to suppress any moves toward democracy and so we have 
an obligation to the burmese people to take a definite course of 
action 
how many league members had fled to rebelheld areas was not 
known but scattered reports said both party members and monks had 
fled the cities to avoid arrest 
a dozen ethnic minority groups long have fought the central 
government demanding more autonomy since 1988 students and 
others fleeing repression have joined them in the interior

the head of the nations largest baptist 
university said monday hes tired of being monitored and 
secondguessed by fundamentalist extremists and hes going to fight 
to keep the school independent 
control of baylor university will be the focal topic when the 
baptist general convention of texas kicks off tuesday said 
university president herbert h reynolds 
as i understand the bible one day i am going to face the 
lord im not going to meet 13 other people standing around to take 
authority therefore i dont need them down here reynolds said 
for the first time in 12 years as far as im concerned on 
sept 21 action was taken to thwart the juggernaut that we have 
seen in the southern baptist convention reynolds said 
on sept 21 baylors board of trustees voted 307 with one 
abstention to revise the schools charter establishing a new board 
of regents to govern the school 
the new board which evetually will have 24 members will be 
elected primarily by the board members themselves with a quarter of 
the members coming from the board of trustees which would continue 
to be elected by the baptist general convention 
at a news conference monday reynolds said the decision came as 
a result of continued friction from overzealous conservatives who 
were threatening to take control of baylor the nations largest 
and oldest baptist university 
we did not seek in any way whatsoever to remove ourselves from 
the lives of texas baptists reynolds said 
we have been disenchanted and unhappy with those in this 
extremist movement and we definitely have sought to distance 
ourselves from them reynolds said we simply came to the point 
that we thought the danger was too great that we might lose our 
opportunity to exercise the kind of religious freedom that we want 
as an institution 
a 25member committee reviewing the relationship between the 
baptist general convention of texas and baylor met for several 
hours monday to assemble a report to the convention 
were simply trying to get our minds together said robert 
naylor chairman of the panel and retired president of the 
southwest seminary in fort worth i think well come out of this 
beyond our crisis 
baylor and the convention of texas have existed for 100 years 
in a bilateral relationship he said our people support baylor 
through the baptist general convention of texas the relationship 
has been as identical as family 
naylor said the schools action in turning its board of trustees 
into a selfperpetuating panel rather than one which had been 
controlled by the convention was done unilaterally 
and that has created much of the chaos he said we were 
not notified and it was in direct contradiction to the constitution 
of the texas convention which provides specifically that no agency 
of the convention shall change its charter without the prior 
approval of the convention 
naylor said the convention over the past 40 years has given the 
school some 78 million he said many of the endowments given to 
the school were made under the belief that the convention would 
continue to control the school 
reynolds said the school was not going to be bullied over 
funding to rescind the charter change 
theres about 6 million a year we have been getting from the 
texas baptists which is about 5 percent of the money weve been 
getting from all sources reynolds said 
we have been extremely grateful to the texas baptist for this 
money but we will not subject ourselves to the kind of focus that 
exists today just to save the money he said

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
nov 512 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
cnn will ask the us supreme court to overturn a 
ban on broadcasting tapes of manuel noriegas telephone 
conversations with his legal team 
constitutional law experts said it could become a landmark case 
cnn spokesman steve haworth said nov 11 that the appeal was 
being prepared but he didnt know when it would be filed 
cnn had defied an order nov 9 by us district judge william 
hoeveler of miami by broadcasting an excerpt in which the deposed 
panamanian dictator spoke in spanish with a secretary for defense 
lawyer frank rubino 
cnn decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the 
excerpt early nov 10 haworth said later that day the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals in atlanta upheld hoevelers ruling 
the appeals court also told cnn to give the seven tapes to the 
miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would 
endanger noriegas right to a fair trial on drugtrafficking 
charges 
noriega is accused of accepting 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin cocaine cartel he has been held at a federal 
prison outside miami since his surrender to us forces shortly 
after the invasion of panama in december 
rubino asked hoeveler to find cnn in direct civil contempt and 
fine the network 300000 for each time it televised the tapes and 
each time it showed them in the future 
cnn accused hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself 
from the case 
floyd abrams a new york constitutional lawyer who served as 
cocounsel for the new york times in the pentagon papers case said 
the cnn case could set precedent because rules involving prior 
restraint have been very clear through the years 
weve almost totally banned prior restraint abrams said 
if the supreme court were to uphold the priorrestraint order on 
cnn this would be the first time in our countrys history that any 
such court order had been affirmed by the court 
in the 1971 pentagon papers case the us supreme court said 
the government could not bar publication of classified documents 
about us involvement in vietnam the times appealed rather than 
defy a lower court order 
george rahdert a lawyer at the poynter institute of media 
studies in st petersburg fla called the cnn case an 
astonishing illustration of censorship but said the network was 
playing with blasting caps by defying the judges order 
its rare in general that a news organization of any kind 
broadcast cable or print would do such a thing said rahdert 
who represents several newspapers it really falls into the 
category of civil disobedience 
cnn president tom johnson said the case is a classic 
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover 
he said the district court and appeals court construed the case 
as a conflict between the sixth amendment which provides a 
defendant a right to a fair trial and the first amendment which 
provides for freedom of the press 
theres a more fundamental issue here reporting the news of 
possible governmental misconduct johnson said if cnn can be 
restrained from airing news about the noriega tapes so can any 
news organization 
attorney general richard thornburgh said us officials wanted 
to find out how the tapes were leaked to cnn 
it concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was 
made of these tapes he said 
hoeveler said he had to weigh noriegas right to a fair trial 
against cnns right to freedom of the press 
its becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure 
that both parties get a fair trial he said 
cnns broadcast marked the first time the tapes themselves had 
been made public but not the first time their contents were 
reported 
new york newsday published a story last month based on summaries 
of the tapes in which unidentified federal sources said it appeared 
the former panamanian leader was attempting to organize resistance 
to the ussupported government of president guillermo endara 
which replaced his regime

the rock hill herald and the charlotte 
nc observer want an appeals court to publish its opinion 
overruling a federal judges priorrestraint order so it can serve 
as a legal precedent 
the opinion in this case if published will provide 
substantial guidance to lower courts in this circuit in the event 
they are requested or otherwise inclined to prohibit the news 
media from publishing information properly obtained during open 
court proceedings papers filed by the newspapers lawyers said 
if the 4th us circuit court of appeals does publish its 
opinion it would mean the case could be cited as a precedent in 
future priorrestraint cases said david robinson ii a lawyer for 
the herald 
theres nothing published of recent vintage that deals with 
open court statements and prior restraint robinson said nov 9 
we think this would be helpful in the future 
unpublished opinions made by the appeals court cannot be cited 
in legal proceedings robinson said 
the case began oct 31 when us district judge charles e 
simons jr inadvertently said in open court in columbia sc that 
rock hill attorney mitchell k byrd was a target of a drug 
investigation 
when simons was told that reporters from the herald and the 
observer were in the courtroom he ordered them not to print his 
remark 
both newspapers appealed the order and neither printed the name 
the following morning 
the herald printed the judges statement about byrd on nov 2 
and was later called to court to defend that action 
on nov 6 the appeals court declared the judges original order 
invalid and simons dropped his case against the herald and 
canceled the ordered court appearance 
john buchan a lawyer for the observer said federal trial 
judges are bound by precedents in their circuits and therefore 
would be required to follow this order if published 
having such a precedent will resolve such issues before they 
reach the appellate court because the laws will be very clear 
buchan said

striking daily news workers are ready to take 
the same pay cuts that their colleagues at the new york post 
accepted two months ago the newspaper unions leader said 
george mcdonald president of the allied printing trades 
council made the comment nov 8 after news publisher james hoge 
said union negotiators had offered only small concessions during 
the 10 months of negotiations that preceded the strike 
mcdonald head of the 10union coalition of workers at both the 
news and the post responded go back and say to hoge that 
mcdonald said at a press conference well match what we gave the 
post 
news spokeswoman lisa robinson said mcdonald should learn that 
the place for negotiations is at the bargaining table not at a 
news conference 
in september nine of the 10 unions agreed to nearly 20 million 
in wage cuts at the post after owner peter kalikow said the only 
alternative was to close the paper many employees agreed to a 20 
percent pay cut by switching to a fourday work week 
the news executives say that they are trying to regain lost 
management control and that the main issues are union overstaffing 
featherbedding and other labor abuses that continue to escalate 
operating costs 
the news meanwhile stepped up efforts to create a network of 
people across the city to sell the newspaper despite an aggressive 
boycott campaign by striking workers 
the paper ran a fullpage ad nov 11 saying it had immediate 
needs for individuals who want to own operate and direct their 
own work force selling newspapers the ad said in large letters 
unlimited income 
the poor and homeless have been recruited by the news as sales 
people one recruit eddy nadreau said the news had called the 
brooklyn shelter where he lives offering 6 an hour and a 
percentage of sales 
strikers fanned out over the city nov 12 to start distributing 
what union officials said were a million copies of an eightpage 
free newspaper titled real news 
all the stories in real news were written by writers who 
have been on strike since oct 25 the paper is aimed at giving the 
strikers version of the labor dispute 
the news has published each day during the strike but 
circulation has been a major problem some vendors have refused to 
sell it and others claim they get no deliveries some vendors say 
they have been threatened by striking drivers 
hoge said last week that 600000 papers were printed each day 
prestrike circulation was about 109 million copies daily making 
the news the nations thirdlargest metropolitan daily 
strikers in turn have reported violence by security forces 
hired by the news 
the chairman of the state assemblys labor committee said nov 9 
that he would conduct hearings into the allegations of violence 
assemblyman frank barbaro centered his remarks on reports of 
violence against strikers and did not mention the allegations of 
threats against vendors or the damage done to trucks and other 
daily news property 
a group of clergymen went to the news building on nov 7 to urge 
the paper to return to negotiations with the strikers and to 
express concern over the economic and social damage of the strike 
speaking for a clerical coalition of conscience the rev 
james a forbes jr senior minister of riverside church said the 
tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees 
seriously undercuts managements claim to be bargaining in good 
faith 
the news spokeswoman said this company is not antiunion we 
have negotiated for the better part of this year and continue to be 
open to the bargaining process 
earlier in the week the national association of black 
journalists canceled an agreement to sell its membership list to 
the news after being pressured by the striking unions the news 
wanted to use the list to contact potential replacement workers 
there was a perception that this was seen as furthering 
managements position that was never our intention said thomas 
morgan president of the association we still feel our members 
have the right to make up their minds about this issue 
the news also sought to buy membership lists from the national 
association of hispanic journalists and the asianamerican 
journalists association but those two groups said they refused 
a star daily news columnist mike mcalary bolted to the rival 
new york post on nov 10 he said he decided to go because of the 
way the daily news treated their employees 
the strike began oct 25 with a dispute at the papers brooklyn 
plant some deliverers walked off the job the news responded by 
bringing in replacement workers 
the walkout spread to eight of nine other unions at the paper 
the unions representing 2100 workers had been working without 
contracts since march 30 
labor leaders have charged that the news owner the tribune 
co provoked the strike to try to break the unions or failing 
that close the paper 
charles brumback president and chief executive officer of 
tribune denied the parent company is calling the shots in the 
news handling of the strike 
this is a new york situation and it will be solved by the 
daily news management in new york he said

rupert murdoch says hes horrified by the rising 
violence in new york and he partly blames what he calls the 
shortcomings of the citys unioncontrolled newspapers 
murdoch said the new york newspaper unions currently on strike 
against the daily news have been the worlds worst since his 
company broke the british unions in a bitter labor struggle in the 
mid1980s 
calling crime in new york quite simply horrible and 
unprecedented murdoch said in a speech nov 8 that the citys 
press was to some extent responsible because the medias 
inhibitions about reporting the crime wave resulted in a sort of 
false consciousness among the public 
murdoch who has a penthouse overlooking manhattans central 
park owned the new york post from 1976 to 1988 and still owns 
wnywtv a local fox channel 
when murdoch ran the post he was regularly denounced for what 
critics called overly sensational coverage of brutal crimes that 
appealed to the publics base passion 
i dont agree that i took it too far downmarket murdoch 
said i think i didnt take it downmarket far enough 
regarding the citys powerful newspaper unions murdoch called 
them one of the obstacles to better newspaper operations and 
journalism in the city 
as you will know in 1986 i took on the printing unions in 
britain the worlds worst and broke them he said the result 
has been a silver age for british journalism newly prosperous 
papers and wholly new papers 
with the demise of those unions he said the new york city 
unions have succeeded to the distinction of being the worlds 
worst

will have to take the onceunthinkable step of putting upi into 
liquidation 
chris dahl secretarytreasurer of the guild said from the 
unions headquarters in new york there is little doubt in our 
minds that the company needs a lot of money and it needs a lot of 
money fast we are simply saying that they are coming to the wrong 
people to get that kind of money 
he said officers of the union were sticking to their 
recommendation that the contract be rejected but would submit it 
to the full membership for a vote 
upi which has changed ownership three times in eight years 
announced nov 2 that it had cut management salaries by 35 percent 
for 90 days and would seek similar concessions from employees 
represented by the guild as it seeks a buyer

month and the publisher of the 9monthold sports daily has been 
relieved of daytoday duties 
steve hammond a spokesman for the paper said nov 12 that 
peter price would continue to hold the titles of president and 
publisher but would be involved with broader issues such as 
entering new markets 
hammond said jaime davila had been brought in to assume prices

deford said the national would end the sunday edition and publish 
five rather than six days a week 
he said there might be a handful of jobs cut but that he 
hoped the number could be absorbed through attrition to avoid 
layoffs

in america we should tighten our belts deford saidin a 
telephone interview 
he denied the newspaper was in serious financial trouble as it 
tries to become the first national sports daily in america its 
just a matter of belttightening he repeated 
a day earlier a source familiar with the newspaper who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said the sunday issue was being discontinued 
because circulation on sundays had amounted to only about 80 
percent of that on weekdays and it had proven harder to distribute 
the paper on sundays than on weekdays 
the national has been published six days a week sunday through 
friday since it was launched jan 31

about 300 journalists marched 
silently down the citys main street nov 8 and picketed the 
presidential palace to protest press laws carried over from the 
deposed regime of manuel antonio noriega 
president guillermo endara who sued a newspaper columnist 
earlier in the week met the journalists outside the palace and 
angrily defended a law under which slander is heavily penalized 
the president of the republic is a person and is going to 
demand reponsibility when there is an attempt to damage his 
honor endara said that is what i will do in each and every 
one of the cases and there is no persecution 
then he turned his back and refused to accept a protest letter 
the journalists had signed 
the next day endara told reporters he was shocked by the 
behavior of the journalists in the march the things they 
shouted at me were really outrageous 
he said he refused to receive the marchers in his office because 
they wanted to enter just because they were reporters as if they 
were the sacred cows of this republic and they arent 
endara installed after the american invasion that overthrew 
noriega filed a slander and damage complaint against dagoberto 
franco of the daily el siglo franco was detained for two days and 
released on 5000 bond 
franco had written a column titled endara the great 
swindle 
at least 60 formal complaints have been filed against 
journalists this year mostly by government officials the 
protesters said 
journalists are asking that slander be changed from a criminal 
to a civil violation the current penalty is two to five years in 
jail 
in their letter the journalists said we are here because 21 
years of castrated journalism has left us a bitter taste of exiles 
threats pressures and fears that we never want to repeat 
panamas constitution provides for freedom of expression but 
says there are legal responsibilities when by any of these media 
one attacks the reputation or honor of the persons in violation of 
the social security or public order

programs host rey langit it is truetolife drama unfolding 
right before you it is both entertaining and educational 
there is no shortage of people wanting to use the program to 
contact relatives overseas even though the price is having 
personal conversations broadcast nationwide

cbs inc shares fluctuated after a report that 
executors of william s paleys estate might decide to sell the 
late cbs chairmans 8 percent stake in the media company 
but cbs executives and media analysts said even if the stock 
were sold chances were slim it could lead to an unfriendly bid for 
control of the company a frequent subject of takeover rumors 
laurence a tisch cbss president and chief executive controls 
loews corp and its 249 percent stake in cbs that stake combined 
with stock held by employees and investors who support tisch 
effectively blocks any unwelcome bids for control of the company 
media analysts say 
the wall street journal reported nov 7 that a sale of the stock 
seemed likely partly because the paley estate valued at about 
500 million must raise 190 million to cover tax obligations 
pat gallagher executive director of the william s paley 
foundation and one of six executors of the estate said he could 
not confirm the tax liability figure but called suggestions the 
stock might be sold pure speculation 
gallagher noted the estate includes other securities and 
investments including artwork and real estate that could be used 
to satisfy tax obligations 
paley longtime chairman of cbs died last month much of his 
estate including 19 million shares of cbs stock valued at nearly 
300 million is to be divided among his six children

a broadcast union at odds with nbc claims nbc 
news is trying to get rid of some older staffers by putting them in 
a common labor pool described as professional exile 
the network denied it 
these people all have jobs and theyre not going away don 
browne nbcs executive news director said of about 35 nbc news 
writers and producers who will be taken from specific programs and 
put in the pool for use as needed 
the move was done as a costcutting measure with the executive 
producers of shows like today and nbc nightly news deciding 
which members of their staff would be shifted to the labor pool 
john clark president of the new york local of the national 
association of broadcast employees and technicians said nov 8 
that 12 of 21 nabet members affected are age 50 or over and we 
think these are people the company would like to get rid of 
he characterized the pool as professional exile for those 
sent there 
browne denied that and other allegations by clark including his 
claim that nbc is apparently retaliating against nabet members who 
sued the network for overtime pay by also putting them in the labor 
pool 
browne said pool members would be put on duty with programs or 
work in nbc news bureaus as requirements dictated these people 
are going to be very active he said 
clark whose 900member local is nabets largest said the union 
will add a claim of age discrimination to a unfair labor practices 
complaint it has filed against nbc with the national labor 
relations board 
no action has been taken yet on the complaint which was filed 
after nbc in august put into effect a new threeyear contract that 
a majority of the unions 2300 members at nbc previously had 
rejected 
three years ago nabet struck nbc in a bitter walkout that 
lasted 17 weeks no strike vote has been called this time so far 
although no new negotiations are planned clark said

michael fuchs chairman and chief executive 
officer of the countrys oldest and largest pay cable channel 
answers the door in tennis shorts and a sweater 
it takes two rings of the doorbell and a series of knocks to 
summon the head of home box office to the entrance of bungalow 11 
at the posh pink beverly hills hotel 
fuchs delay in answering the door is indicative of the way he 
presents himself and his behemoth company during the next 45 
minutes 
alternately tugging at his shorts and sprawling across a sofa 
fuchs smacks loudly on a piece of fruit to specific questions he 
gives vague answers or aggressively counters with queries of his 
own 
talking to michael fuchs is not easy but then the leader of 
hbo has never prided himself on congeniality 
he likes to conduct business with an inyourface attitude this 
does not make him one of the most wellliked men in the 
evercompetitive world of cable 
fuchs knows this he thrives on it 
screw em he said when paramount unsuccessfully threatened 
hbos parent company time inc with a hostile takeover last year 
but the vista from which an arrogant fuchs once surveyed his 
competitors is now eroding 
with 173 million subscribers hbos growth is stagnant 
about 22 percent of cableequipped homes take hbo the same 
number as in 1983 the comedy channel hbos latest foray into the 
overcrowded market of basic cable stations has been far from a 
success 
not to mention that archrival viacom international inc owners 
of basic cable standards such as mtv nickolodeon and pay channel 
showtime started ha its own 24hour comedy station five months 
after hbo 
neither has captured the attention of more than 8 million 
viewers each in a market where more than half of americas 931 
million tv households subscribe to cable 
when fuchs launched the comedy channel a year ago he called it 
hbos manifest destiny 
now he has changed his tune 
going out with a basic cable channel right now is like going 
through an indian gantlet fuchs says of an industry where cable 
subscribers already can chose from an average of 30 stations at no 
extra cost to their monthly bill were not masochists 
all talks of merging ha and the comedy channel are off he 
says 
i dont want to put any more marbles in the cable business 
he says were a plenty big player 
indeed hbo is besides being the no 1 pay cable channel the 
network also owns cinemax 40 percent of the e entertainment 
network and a newly formed production company that plans 
programming for the big three networks and other cable services it 
also has a highly lucrative foreign and domestic video distribution 
arm 
the merger of parent company time inc with warner 
communications now makes hbo part of the worlds largest media 
conglomerate 
still pay television has lost its momentum vcrs and a vast 
array of basic cable stations such as turner network television and 
the usa network are responsible for helping to stunt pay tvs 
growth 
if venturing into basic cable channels no longer is the future 
for hbo where does it go in an everchanging cable world 
and what will hbo offer subscribers who must pay on the 
average an additional 12 to receive its programming when basic 
cable costs already provide madeforcable movies classic films 
specials and sports events 
fuchs calls such questions naive 
look he says taking another bite of plum you bring em as 
good a television program as you can what does any other network 
what is nbc going to bring their customers 
i still think we do the best movies in cable he says his 
mouth full of fruit we think were in a very crowded television 
world its a hell of a lot more crowded now that its ever been 
customers who have lived with hbo see it as a little more 
experimental a little more provocative a little more honest a 
documentary on hbo has more credibility than anywhere else 
last years murderers among us the story of nazi hunter 
simon wiesenthal won hbo an emmy for writing in a television 
movie 
this month the network received a leading 100 award for cable 
excellence nominations among those noted were the series dream 
on not necessarily the news and tales from the crypt and 
cable movies the image and ageold friends 
fuchs sees such accolades as a key part of hbos survival 
ace nominations aside hbo still has not significantly increased 
its subscriber base asked again how the pay channel plans to keep 
up with a market that has slowed its growth fuchs replies 
it gets a hundred and thirty ace nominations when the next guy 
gets 30 it gives the best programming on cable hows that 
but you know that already dont ya 
actually as mentioned earlier it was 100 nominations and the 
next closest competitors were tnt and showtime with 31 nominations 
each

judicial temperament he can muster this week when he opens 
politically charged public hearings into the links between five 
senators and charles h keating jr owner of the failed lincoln 
savings and loan 
the panel is trying to determine if 13 million in political 
donations the five senators accepted from keating prompted their 
intervention on his behalf with banking regulators 
heflin throughout his career has portrayed himself as someone 
who is very judicious fair honest and someone who has a judicial 
temperament said patrick cotter a university of alabama 
political scientist 
that reputation has been smudged in recent weeks by gop 
complaints that the panel was delaying a decision to drop the 
investigation of two of the five senators including the only 
republican until after the midterm elections 
when the allegations surfaced on the senate floor heflin 
responded with uncharacteristic haste he dashed off a statement 
accusing his critics of partisan motives and blasting the 
organized campaign of leaks that prompted their charges 
i do not believe that the ethics committee should be placed in 
the position of responding to pressure for the benefit of a friend 
or friends or the disadvantage of enemies or for a party 
position he said 
the committees special counsel recommended in september that 
the case against republican john mccain of arizona and democrat 
john glenn of ohio be dismissed and that investigations proceed 
against democrats alan cranston of california donald w riegle jr 
of michigan and dennis deconcini of arizona 
the committees failure to act on those recommendations sparked 
the preelection partisan recriminations that preceded the panels 
decision to hold public hearings this week on all five senators 
heflin said last week he doesnt know how the hearings will be 
affected by cranstons announcement that he has cancer and will 
have to undergo either surgery or radiation treatment if cranston 
is unavailable he said the committee will have to decide whether 
to proceed without him 
heflin who was reelected to a third term last week with 61 
percent of the vote purposely maintains a low profile on ethics 
cases when his gop opponent tried to make a campaign issue of the 
committees failure to act on the special counsels report heflin 
refused to respond 
just because somebody else breaks an oath that doesnt mean 
that ive got to break mine he said referring to news leaks 
about the report confidentiality is the rule and you have to 
play by the rules 
outside the ethics arena the hulking heflin he stands 
6feet4 and weighs well over 250 pounds is rarely reticent 
hes known as one of the senates best storytellers long before 
he met heflin supreme court justice david souter a new hampshire 
native said he had heard of tieless hawkins and shoeless sam two 
fictional characters heflin has used for decades to entertain 
alabama audiences 
first elected in 1978 heflins senate career has been dominated 
by his efforts to protect home state aerospace defense and 
agricultural interests 
a fiscal conservative whos rarely met a tax increase he 
couldnt oppose heflin has been the most consistent democratic 
vote in the senate for president bush and former president reagan 
the one area where heflin has parted most often with gop 
presidents has been civil rights he supported the civil rights 
bill that bush vetoed this year and has opposed any number of 
republican appointees targeted by civil rights groups 
on the judiciary committee his is one of three swing votes he 
swung against robert borks nomination to the supreme court in 
1987 and for edwin meese controversial nomination to be attorney 
general in 1985 
the ethics spotlight of the keating five hearings will be 
nothing new for heflin he has been chairman or vice chairman of 
the committee during his entire senate career 
he led the 1982 prosecution of new jersey democrat harrison 
williams who resigned before the senate could expel him for his 
role in abscam and earlier this year he led the senate in 
denouncing sen david durenberger rminn for financial 
improprieties 
heflin said he used to enjoy the committee because it let me 
exercise my judicial tools and skills in interpreting ethics laws 
and rulings for his colleagues but not anymore 
now youre dealing with your fellow senators and their 
problems and before long they look at you as being a policeman 
he said when all of this stuff is over ill be seeking 
relief

to serve as mayor more than 25 years is 
remarkable in the most placid of cities but in selma ala joe 
smitherman has survived volcanic selmas racial eruptions to win 
election seven times in retrospect he says if i were black i 
would have agitated too now he says enoughs enough hes 
stepping down at the end of his current term 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
shortly before a heart attack laid him up a 
few weeks ago mayor joe smitherman was ruminating on the formula 
that has kept him in office a quarter century could it be the one 
had something to do with the other 
you start a project he was saying and before you finish 
it start another and before you finish that one start another 
and so on 
be the busiest person in town doing things for selma that the 
people can see and touch it never fails it keeps your friends 
happy and your enemies off balance 
those who know joe smitherman friends and enemies agree he is 
a man of action all right they say he seems driven he runs on 
high test and makes decisions more on gut instinct than deep 
thought a hip shooter on this sunday morning though smitherman 
was in a reflective mood 
the mayor observes a sort of sabbath ritual he rises early 
drives downtown parks behind city hall enters through a back 
door plugs in the coffeepot and meditates for an hour or so 
alone on sunday morning the city hall on many occasions in this 
town the epicenter of shattering tumult is as peaceful as a 
shrine 
the upheaval that rocked selma a generation ago changed the 
political landscape of the south and rippled through the entire 
nation it is where black americans systematically 
disenfranchised won the right freely to vote to have a say in 
their own governance from that day to this joe smitherman has been 
mayor of selma experiencing all the predictable aftershocks 
coffee in hand feet on desk smitherman was saying the other 
day that he intends to leave office when his current fouryear 
term his seventh expires in two years 
selmians as they call themselves have heard that tune before 
in fact in 1979 after 15 years in office smitherman worn out 
stepped aside for a year and gave his gavel to the president of the 
city council when the next election came around he was back in 
the race he has never lost an election this time though 
selmians are betting the heart attack may influence the mayors 
resolve and are wondering what is to become of selma when the 
smitherman reign as one historian calls it in a recent volume 
comes to an end 
selma will do just fine smitherman said it will have to 
because its time for me to go ive walked this tightrope long 
enough and im getting tired do you know how wearing this job can 
be 
wearing yes according to a researcher at the us conference 
of mayors it is rare in this country for anyone to last in that 
office for as long as 25 years that would include mayors of 
complacent towns where nothing much happens to cause a happy 
citizenry to want to change anything 
if such places exist this storied town on the bloodred banks 
of the alabama river surely is not one of them 
whatever happens in selma good or bad has for the past 25 
years been viewed against the backdrop of its past a surprising 
number of visitors still drop by daily to gawk at the city that 
became a symbol its very name a curse a rallying cry for passage 
of the voting rights act back in 1965 
the old conjure women on the riverbank used to whisper the 
legend that stars once fell on alabama a powerful omen the land 
was cursed some in selma find reason to believe it 
a historical marker outside city hall records the two pivotal 
events a hundred years apart that marked their city for all time 
one side commemorates the day in 1865 when yankee soldiers 
sacked the town and burned its confederate arsenal 
the other side commemorates the day in 1965 bloody sunday 
when troopers and mounted deputies whipped and teargassed black 
americans protesting the blatant scheme that denied them the 
ballot 
that event and the 10 angry weeks of demonstrations leading up 
to it occurred the year after joe smitherman took office it fell 
upon him then to preside over what could be called selmas second 
reconstruction 
selma then and now is a city of about 27000 almost equally 
divided racially about 52 percent black but the differences 
between then and now are striking 
the selma where smitherman grew up was a cotton town ravaged by 
the boll weevil and the depression he was born in 1929 the 
youngest of six children of a widowed mother who died when he was 
11 he was raised in a shotgun house on a dirt street in east 
selma the wrong side of the tracks where scrawny chickens 
scratched around outhouses 
back then selma was so rigidly segregated that even the fishing 
ponds side by side were designated colored and white to 
smitherman it was an unquestioned way of life like lining up 
saturdays on water avenue for government surplus food those lines 
though were for both races 
in retrospect said smitherman especially after i took 
office i knew good and well we were wrong if i were black i would 
have agitated too and if i couldnt vote id have been an 
activist probably more extreme than some who came here 
and selma today the mayor likes to take visitors on personal 
tours what they see at first glance could serve as a model of 
civic progress and racial harmony in any region of america side by 
side blacks and whites work live shop worship vote serve on 
the city council and the school board patrol together in police 
cars

todays generation of selma blacks take integration for granted 
and view bloody sunday as something from long ago that they learn 
about during black history month like slavery 
and yet not unlike cities of all sizes in every region selma 
still feels the ache of what has become a national migraine reduced 
to a single syllable race 
black eligible voters in selma and dallas county now outnumber 
whites barely under smitherman selma has gerrymandered its wards 
so that five blacks and five whites sit on the city council the 
council president elected atlarge is currently white council 
members have an unwritten agreement that a person of the same race 
will be appointed to replace any one of them leaving office in 
midterm 
very often in selma seemingly neutral issues that come before 
the council are resolved along racial lines many chalk it up to 
the citys heritage of confrontation it seems to have left selma 
as fragile as a house of cards the whole town hoping nobody will 
bump the table 
somehow smitherman has managed to keep the balance to walk the 
tightrope as he says without losing control 
joe smitherman is a man of great cunning says the rev fred 
reese he knows how to manipulate the white people to accept 
changes that will benefit the black people and them too really 
he knows just how far to go and still keep white support without 
losing black support 
reese is the principal of selma high school back in 1964 he was 
the head of the dallas county voters league the person who lured 
martin luther king to selma for the voting rights crusade he was 
also one of the few blacks who managed to register to vote despite 
the obstacles of the time in the 1964 mayors race he voted for 
smitherman 
joe and i are the same age we grew up in the same part of 
town in similar circumstances said reese blacks can identify 
with him 
for the 30 years before smitherman ran there hadnt been a real 
race for mayor selmas ruling gentry passed the office from one of 
their number to the next like a fiefdom the only requirement was 
to keep things as is 
smitherman then was a brash upstart he was a gawky young 
appliance salesman with a long neck and big ears and no friends at 
the country club he managed to get elected to the city council 
where he became a royal pain he wanted to do city business in the 
open for example instead of in the back room brash 
he ran for mayor pledging to represent all the people not the 
favored few and his campaign fliers underlined the word all 
i figured everybody had a favored few they didnt like he 
said i was right when i won the old guard wouldnt even give 
me a key to city hall i had to get one made 
the civil rights demonstrations behind him smitherman became 
the busiest man in town he pushed through a penny sales tax and 
did things people could see and touch paved and lighted streets 
new garbage trucks fire engines sewer lines 
he became an expert at wheedling money out of washington money 
the old guard shunned as tainted inviting federal 
interference 
only thing tainted about it is taint enough of it 
smitherman told them 
and more visible and touchable things appeared each new project 
overlapping the last new libraries new city hall new housing 
projects schools museums fountains trees and flowers and parks 
train crossings were a hazard he stopped a 180car freight with 
a police car and ticketed the conductor for blocking streets the 
railroad rescheduled 
he refused to pay the citys electric bill until the power 
company explained its passon charges so the people could know 
what they were paying for 
when ku klux klansmen showed up on the city hall steps he called 
them white trash and ran them out of town blacks applauded he 
padlocked the antipoverty office because only 5 percent of the 
paid employees were white not enough whites applauded 
at the 20th anniversary observance of bloody sunday smitherman 
went to the pulpit of brown chapel where martin luther king had 
preached and said my hands are as dirty as the others we were 
wrong im sorry he shared a hymnal with jesse jackson and sang 
we shall overcome 
i suppose ive been the most visible person in the state short 
of the governor smitherman said and a lot of people expected 
me to run for higher office 
when i was younger i gave some thought to it but after a few 
terms i discovered its hard for mayors to do that 
mayors cant duck issues or avoid taking sides for mayors 
the public is as close as the sidewalk you either get the garbage 
picked up or you dont you either remove the dangerous tree or you 
dont you cant tell an angry citizen that youll have a committee 
look into it not if you want to get reelected 
also you need what i call the big mules the money boys who 
finance your campaign and dont let you forget where you got the 
money ive shifted around so much politically backing democrats 
republicans whatever that the big mules who know me could never 
be sure if id stay hitched 
anyhow selma is all i really care about and being mayor of 
selma has been sufficient two more years and im history

here you know generally what youve been exposed to i think 
there is an effort on the part of these facilities to keep some 
control over those discharges 
the energy department says it has spent more than 1 billion to 
clean up the area in the last decade there was a time when 
radioactive and hazardous waste was just buried in shallow 
trenches the cleanup effort involves resurrecting the waste and 
packaging it in more stable containers the agency also has drained 
settling ponds and paved over them 
not everyone is satisfied with the effort 
lawsuits have been filed over mercury contamination in the 
watershed and creeks near the plants are posted to stop fishing or 
swimming 
environmental scientists still are studying the amount of 
hazardous materials in sediment of a lake downstream 
health studies of the work force from the 1940s on show no 
substantial increases in mortality says donna l cragle deputy 
program leader for the center of epidemiologic research at oak 
ridge associated universities 
i would say its not any worse than any other place she 
says there are mortality studies related to many industries and 
generally these workers look like most of those there arent any 
of the real strong mortality relationships you see with some of the 
others 
but cragle says there has never been a thorough study of the 
impact on the health of the general population around the 
reservation 
hibbitts says living in oak ridge is a matter of adjusting to 
a perception of risk 
the sorts of things we talk about as far as the risk of 
working or living here are very small compared to the risks i live 
with on a daily basis he says 
the amount of radiation exposure i get from working here is a 
very tiny part of the radiation exposure i get just for being a 
human being if i want to manage my risk in terms of exposure i 
dont move from oak ridge i ventilate my house to get rid of the 
radon 
some of the critics of the plants are opposed to nuclear weapons 
on principle they hold a protest every aug 6 the anniversary of 
the bombing of hiroshima and usually manage to get arrested for 
trespassing on government property 
the peace alliance headed by smith is the most visible critic of 
the energy departments management 
even if we pardon the past theyre still experimenting 
putting citizens at risk because theyve got such a mess they dont 
know what to do with it he argues they have tremendous 
problems out there im not trying to just criticize because i 
know theyve got some good people out there doing their best but 
its time for this entire country to reassess its nuclear policy 
smith says the question that should be asked is whether the 
plants have been protecting us or poisonng us 
were just shifting the burden to the next generation and i 
cant go along with that he says the fact that theyre still 
producing nuclear weapons is not acceptable the greatest threat to 
me and my children is the pollution not some other countrys 
nuclear weapons 
smith suggests another mighty national effort may be the only 
way to reverse the legacy of an earlier one 
we need a manhattan project ii to clean it up he says 
smith says his group with a core of about 50 people and a 
mailing list of 3000 faces some enmity in the region 
but weve found there is a lot of support out there for what 
were doing i think there would be more except for the economics 
were constantly being forced to choose between shortterm 
economic wellbeing and longterm environmental wellbeing and to 
me that is blackmail 
hibbitts disagrees he says the citizens are not shrinking 
violets and would if the evidence convinced them their lives were 
in danger raise as much of a protest as necessary to change it 
the latest environmental flap to ensue from the government 
reservation is the pollution in watts bar lake just downstream on 
the clinch river 
the energy department held two public hearings this summer to 
tell citizens about the problem and what is being done which is 
mainly to study the nature and extent of the pollution 
the department says most of the pollution is buried in the 
deepest and most stable sediments of the lake and is therefore 
safely out of the way 
bob humphreys is mayor of kingston a small town on watts bar 
just southwest of oak ridge he attended the first hearing he 
says and felt some assurance after that i think theyre doing 
more than people realize to monitor that situation 
humphreys says residents of the area are concerned but adds 
weve run every kind of test in the world and according to those 
we have nothing to be alarmed about 
in the end humphreys says people will likely find little to 
worry about and certainly not enough to call down the economic 
force that may be putting bread on their table 
oak ridge is the livelihood for a big percentage of kingston 
that makes a difference in the way they think

salman rushdie and his satanic verses aside 
literature in india is venturing into new territory crossing 
international boundaries heres a look at a group of young indian 
writers attracting a lot of attention with their irreverent style 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a new generation of indian writers has 
burst forth winning acclaim at home and abroad for everything from 
sonnets to satire 
inspired by salman rushdie and others they are irreverently 
testing the limits of language and venturing into styles rarely 
seen in their homeland 
while some critics say it smacks of elitism most write in 
english the language foisted on india by colonial rulers but is 
now at least as indigenous to indias upper crust as hindi 
bengali urdu and tamil 
i learned to read in english to curse in english to make 
love in english says shashi tharoor author of the great 
indian novel which is scheduled for release in the united states 
this winter i dont think any of my other languages is good 
enough to express the ideas 
some such as rushdie and bharati mukherjee have left their 
homeland changed their citizenship and found audiences in their 
adopted lands more receptive than those in india 
meenakshi mukherjee one of indias leading literary critics 
credits rushdie with breaking international barriers with 
midnights children which won britains booker award in 1981 
rushdie is now a citizen of britain where he went into hiding 
in february 1989 because of death threats from moslems enraged by 
what they considered the blasphemy of his novel the satanic 
verses 
salman rushdie showed that you can do anything you want 
says ms mukherjee a professor at jawaharlal nehru university 
in midnights children he uses bombay as anybody would use 
london or new york hes the first one who didnt have a glossary 
to explain indian terms if you dont understand thats your 
problem not my problem 
tharoor and several others including amitav ghosh upamanyu 
chatterjee and i allan sealy stick to their indian roots in 
themes but transcend national boundaries in their literary 
migrations whether geographical cultural or psychological 
a few such as vikram seth tackle the literary world on 
universal terms seth author of the golden gate a 300page 
sonnet of entangled san francisco loves and lovers is known in his 
hometown of new delhi as the indian who wrote the great 
california novel 
seth who also wrote a chinatibet travel book called from 
heaven lake and recently published a volume of poems called all 
you who sleep tonight travels around the world but spends much 
of the year in india 
there is a resurgence in indianess people being proud of 
being indian says david davidar publisher of penguin books 
india ltd i think the colonial thing is finally being put to 
rest all the younger writers are under 50 
davidars publishing house has issued more than 40 books of 
fiction by indian writers since its presses started rolling in 
1988 forty percent of penguin india is owned by the britishbased 
penguin company which means indian writers picked up by penguin at 
home get an automatic chance at option by penguin affiliates in 
london and new york 
indian books have improved technically in the last few years 
fewer paperbacks fall apart in a shower of pages the first time you 
crack the spine but its the content thats so markedly improved 
tharoor purloined the names of characters from the epic hindu 
poem mahabharata great india to irreverently populate the 
political landscape of 20th century india in the great indian 
novel 
tharoors novel like 18th century angloirish satirist jonathan 
swifts gullivers travels succeeds on seveal levels at face 
value the great indian novel is an amusing bit of fantasy on 
a general political plane it pokes fun at the ambitions and 
foibles of presumably fictitious politicians but to the reader 
armed with knowledge of indias modern and mythical heroes and 
antiheroes the analogies are devastating

dhritarashtra the blind and ineffectual king in 
mahabharata is the name tharoor chooses for his parody of 
jawaharlal nehru the first prime minister of independent india 
he had the blind mans gift of seeing the world not as it was 
but as he wanted it to be remarks ved vyas tharoors narrator 
even better he was able to convince everyone around him that his 
vision was superior to theirs 
the fictional vyas at the age of 88 is dictating his memoirs 
full of barbs as future prime minister dhritarashtra embarks on 
the path that leads to the bloody partition of india and pakistan 
their stillunresolved dispute over kashmir and his own 
preeminence as a founder of modern india and the third world 
nonaligned movement 
tharoor 33 who works for the united nations high commissioner 
for refugees in geneva speaks hindi french and a bit of 
bengali but he says his novel is a book that could only have 
been written in english the kind of people who speak english in my 
book would normally speak english 
ms mukherjee says the new novelists seem to have an idiom 
thats almost international irreverent playful you make fun of 
serious things but shes troubled by their elitism in a country 
where only 44 percent of the 880 million people are literate in any 
language and only an estimated 4 percent read english 
all of them come through the conduit of the same small 
institution she says referring to delhi universitys st 
stephens college i dont feel all that wonderful about it it 
brings home to you the social reality of the books theyre all 
really upper class 
indias earlier generations of novelists such as rk narayan 
whose first books were published in the 1930s were more 
selfconscious about writing in english ms mukherjee says and 
indias only nobel prize winner for literature 1913 was 
rabindranath tagore who wrote poetry in bengali 
the elite crowd of young novelists all in their 30s 
includes 
ghosh who used his native bengal as the embarkation point for 
his ponderous first novel a circle of reason and again for 
the more delicately crafted the shadow lines 
sealy whose angloindian ancestry inspired the 
trotternama and who uses a crazy quilt of literary devices for a 
family saga that starts in the late 18th century with the arrival 
of justin aloysius trotter in fictional nakhlau which resembles 
lucknow during the british raj 
chatterjee whose english august an indian story traces 
a young bengali civil servants search for identity during his 
posting to a remote village 
less precocious and less indian at least to indian readers 
is bharati mukherjee 49 who left india to study at the university 
of iowa nearly three decades ago and married a canadian she became 
a us citizen in 1980 
bharati mukherjee whose novels and short stories have been 
published in the united states for the past 18 years won americas 
national book critics circle award in 1988 for the middleman and 
other stories 
the central thread in middleman is immigrants and not just 
indians who come to the united states her characters include an 
iraqi jew involved in central american intrigues a second 
generation italianamerican with an afghan refugee lover a vietnam 
war veteran coming to terms with the child he fathered in saigon 
i like to think im writing from the inside about white 
america she says for me america is an idea an abstract 
entity america is a frontier that needs constant pushing

the televised images of oilblackened beaches 
and dead wildlife dealt a severe blow to tourism in alaska the 
states thirdlargest industry but now the tourists are beginning 
to return and officials hope to lure them off the cruise ships and 
railroad cars and into the countryside 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
to try to lure back tourists lost after 
the exxon valdez oil spill the alaska visitors association put out 
an ad featuring a closeup of marilyn monroes face 
without the mole 
the famous beauty mark on marilyns face was missing the ad 
explained that she was beautiful even without her mole just as oil 
spilled in one part of alaska did not diminish all of the states 
natural wonders 
whether that ad deserves the credit or not tourism officials 
say business is on the upswing again after a sharp drop following 
the oil spill in march 1989 
tourism is alaskas thirdbiggest industry behind oil and 
fishing last summer 560000 visitors spent more than 300 million 
in alaska state officials say 
tourism fell off following the oil spill when pictures of 
blackened beaches and dead sea otters were televised worldwide the 
spill took an estimated 20 million bite out of alaska visitor 
spending in 1989 says eric mcdowell a juneau consultant 
but tourism rebounded last summer except at some fishing 
lodges which still suffer from lingering concerns about tainted 
fish mcdowell says 
stan stephens a valdez tourboat operator says his business 
this summer was back to prespill levels while some people may be 
avoiding the sound stephens says about a third of his customers 
ask to see bligh reef the submerged rock that ripped open the 
exxon valdezs hull 
diversifying the tourism industry has been a goal of outgoing 
gov steve cowper and many of the small business owners who cater 
to alaska visitors 
mcdowell and others say that most alaska visitors still arrive 
on cruise ships even among visitors classified as independent 
travelers many spend part of their alaska vacation on packaged 
tours 
when a destination first develops people are cautious and 
they tend to go in for packaged tours mcdowell says but as 
information gets out through word of mouth independent travel to 
alaska has grown faster than other segments 
advertisers selling alaskas scenic splendor to tourists in the 
1980s usually appealed to retiredage travelers who could see the 
wilderness from comfortable cruise ships or railroad viewing cars 
this fall however a nationwide cable television advertising 
campaign targeted the independent travelers 
adventurers wanted one commercial proclaims 
independent travelers arent content to watch a glacier from 
behind a cruise ship window says rod bradley of anchoragebased 
bradley advertising producer of the new ads 
people want the scenic wonders of alaska to be the backdrop to 
their activities picnicking on a beach buying items going to 
dinner fishing bradley says 
everyone thinks of himself as an adventurer and the ads play 
on the subjective image people have of themselves as 
participants 
independent travelers plan their own itineraries instead of 
letting a tour company do it says dana brockway the state 
director of tourism they take shorter more frequent trips spend 
more money than other travelers and spread it among a wider range 
of businesses 
additionally independents provide the tourism industry with its 
best chance to extend tourism into more remote parts of the state 
and into the winter months 
independent travelers are where our real market growth has 
been this year says steve hites of the white pass and yukon 
railroad 
tourists riding the narrowgauge railroad out of skagway arrive 
on cruise ships and the alaska ferry or drive the alaskacanada 
highway in recreation vehicles he says 
increasing the rubbertire traffic into alaska is a big part 
of the states strategy to capitalize on the growth of independent 
travel says bob miller director of the alaska tourism marketing 
council 
state officials in 1992 will use the 50th anniversary of the 
building of the alaska highway to promote independent travel to 
alaska 
we need to soften the harsh image of the alaska highway 
brockway says few people know its virtually all paved and 
theres more to do along the way 
although independent travelers are being wooed with images of

at an age when most of their peers are knitting 
sweaters or puttering around in the garden thousands of older 
citizens are trying to catch up with their kids and grandkids on 
the keyboards of their computers computer training centers for 
people 55 and older are springing up across the country

at age 69 joanna goodblood joined 
the revolution the telecommunications revolution 
i want to know as much about computers as my daughter knows 
says mrs goodblood one of the newest recruits in seniornet a 
nonprofit organization that teaches fundamental computer skills to 
people 55 and older 
seniornet based at the university of san francisco runs 35 
computer training centers in 17 states and canada 
the newest center is at johnson county community college in this 
kansas city suburb where goodblood and 35 others are enrolled in 
three computer classes thirty others are on a waiting list 
a lot of time people when they get old are intimidated by 
technology mrs goodblood says as her classmates peck away on 
their keyboards during their second day of class but this is a 
way to get into it without your feeling like a dodo 
since it started in 1986 seniornet has trained more than 4000 
older adults to use computers about 1100 have signed up for a 
seniornet network that allows them to send and receive messages to 
one another using personal computers linked to a telephone system 
the people in our classes arent in there for their resumes 
says mary furlong an education professor at the university of san 
francisco and a founder of seniornet the majority want to keep 
learning they want to keep up with their children and 
grandchildren 
furlong and a colleague began seniornet in 1983 as a research 
project they wanted to find out whether older people would be 
willing to learn about computers and use them 
industry surveys have found that only 9 percent of adults 60 to 
69 years old own computers and only 3 percent of those older than 
70 by contrast about 20 percent of all us households have 
computers 
what we discovered was older adults were very interested and 
very capable largely because they had more time to learn 
says furlong who coauthored a book titled computers for kids 
over 60 
seniors bring patience and expertise to their computer 
learning she says they find that using computers can open new 
doors for them once they overcome their initial fear of the 
technology 
for a 25 fee members receive a twomonth handson training 
course and a quarterly newsletter they also can make a 15 
membership payment for access to the network that connects them 
with each others computers they are charged 570 an hour for 
their online time 
the computer curriculum includes among other things training 
on how to write letters do newsletters and run budgets furlong 
says 
on the network members go on line every wednesday night to 
correspond and debate issues such as the persian gulf situation 
and the stock market 
many of the students who have ranged in age from 55 to 95 have 
used their computer training for such things as cataloging 
collections and tracking investment portfolios 
im in a lot of groups and a computer would be a convenient 
way of helping me with filekeeping and my records says 
65yearold lee fisher another seniornet student 
the john and mary r markle foundation of new york is the chief 
financial supporter of seniornet which is the first nationwide 
effort to help older adults participate in the telecommunications 
revolution 
computer centers are located in schools community centers 
nursing homes and eyecare centers 
the college was chosen as the site because of its willingness to 
provide its computer education resources says cathie peterson a 
college spokeswoman the college has provided the computers 
computer labs and instructor 
some critics contend that working on computers will contribute 
to the isolation of senior citizens but those involved with 
seniornet disagree 
the communication were trying to establish is like that of a 
park in the 1990s furlong said you may not be able to walk 
across town but if you go on line everybody is right there

she was one of the most celebrated opera singers 
of all time joan sutherland retired last month after a career that 
spanned almost 40 years but hers is a voice that wont soon be 
forgotten her colleagues remember her as a true prima donna who 
worked hard at her craft and didnt put on airs 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when joan sutherland made her italian debut in 
1960 in handels alcina the tough venice audience rose and 
shouted la stupenda 
fans have been calling the australian diva that ever since dame 
joan who recently retired after nearly 40 years has had one of 
the most significant careers in the history of opera 
one of her fans is tenor luciano pavarotti who knows stupendous 
singing when he hears it i think to the world of opera she has 
meant the greatest coloratura soprano of all time he says we 
do not know what giuditta pasta for whom bellini wrote norma 
in 1831 and others sounded like but i dont think they can be 
vocally better than joan sutherland 
lotfi mansouri general director of the san francisco opera has 
directed dame joan in more operas than any other director joan 
is one of the absolutely greatest in the field of opera in the last 
30 years he says i had the great fortune of working with her 
the first time i directed in 1963 it was a production of 
sonnambula by bellini 
mansouris production of the merry widow was dame joans 
last american performance that was a year ago in dallas the same 
city where she first sang opera in the united states 
dame joan retired at 63 in october at the sydney opera house 
less than half a mile from the sydney conservatorium of music where 
she began her career in 1951 tickets for the final performance 
mansouris production of meyerbeers the huguenots cost up to 
415 
she was a unique artist mansouri says she had a very 
extreme vocal range most of the time coloraturas are smaller 
lighter voices joan had a lush middle register she always had a 
very good ear her pitch was always accurate 
maria callas revived the bel canto and the mantle was passed 
to joan she had more vocal flexibility than callas 
dame joans colleagues note that she brought unfamiliar operas 
into the repertoire giving operagoers more variety they talk of 
her as a prima donna who didnt put on airs worked hard and was an 
inspiration 
the only thing she would ever argue about mansouri says 
is she would say youre overestimating my ability 
i asked her in the second act of die fledermaus to dance 
part of the czardas she said are you crazy dancing it and 
singing it at the same time you must be joking then shed go 
ahead and do it she was very game 
the last time i directed her was in toronto in hamlet she 
said im a grandmother you dont want me to do ophelia finally 
i convinced her she was absolutely wonderful her mad scene was 
something ill never forget it was the last new role she ever 
learned 
some critics point out that dame joan didnt always articulate 
consonants her voice was silver like a flute while some 
preferred warmer sounds and her acting sometimes seemed detached 
i dont believe that business that she was not a good 
actress mansouri says she was not an intellectual type 
actress she was very honest sincere she would bring a lot from 
herself 
while dame joan sang operas that other sopranos sing such as 
la traviata she also sang the early 19thcentury operas of 
rossini bellini and donizetti that most others couldnt sing 
the primary interest in those bel canto operas is melody and 
voice the verismo school where realism and big orchestras reign 
began at the end of the 19th century 
tenor alfredo kraus who sang often with dame joan says at 
the same time we are artists we are teachers it is easy to give 
audiences what they know if you give them what they dont know 
you are giving them education

dame joan never tried to hold a throne alone the reigning norma 
of her day she suggested to soprano montserrat caballe that she 
sing norma caballe was afraid to try but dame joan was 
persuasive then there were two highly successful normas 
when dame joan sang norma the mezzosoprano was usually marilyn 
horne horne a onetime soprano was inspired by sutherland to 
take up the coloratura mezzo and contralto roles in which she had 
made her fame 
the world was ready for this stuff again says horne 
along came this unbelievable singer who could do these things 
joan is really the best 
i think there arent a lot of singers who do something 
original something that really contributes to the history of the 
world of music and joan is one of those people she not only sang 
gloriously but she has revived all these fabulous things 
and we must also talk about joans revivals of french music 
and contribution to the baroque she has been a major handel singer 
and done baroque opera this has been a significant vocal lady 
the 1955 premiere of sir michael tippetts the midsummer 
marriage also had sutherland in the cast 
maria callas career was winding down when sutherland hit in 
1959 one of sutherlands first roles at covent garden was as 
callas maid in norma 
if you study callas repertoire it was not so vast horne 
says joan did many operas callas didnt do shes been in there 
slugging it out for many years 
whether bel canto operas will continue to be sung after dame 
joan depends on whether somebody comes along who can sing them 
horne believes that thanks to dame joans bringing those operas 
back into favor voice students increasingly will study bel canto 
technique it has opened up a whole repertoire for young 
singers 
dame joans husband since 1954 is conductor richard bonynge 
hand in hand rick goes with joan horne says she was the 
great voice he was really the guiding light he has nurtured and 
protected that voice he has been devoted to her and that 
instrument 
mansouri says shes fortunate her husband is such a good 
musician she was offered an enormous variety of roles he advised 
her not to accept things not good for her voice some singers say 
yes to everything and pretty soon the voice is gone 
sutherland took pavarotti with her on his first major tour 
through australia soon after his first american appearance that 
was with her in 1965 in miami in lucia di lammermoor 
she was a great inspiration pavarotti says she was 
always there ready to sing never late to a performance and always 
giving suggestions 
mansouri says a joan sutherland doesnt come along every day 
shes once in a lifetime it was an honor to work with her

viner dove also publishes books and produces movies and 
miniseries

that means she has to change her looks demeanor and attitude 
the fun of the piece is that everyone is impersonating someone 
else were all fakes and making believe 
the miniseries also calls for raffin to play sara at age 70 and 
that led to an accident removing makeup that injured her eyes 
it was a fluke she says we had a wonderful makeup man

from my face some of the oil got into my eyes the next day by 
noon the pain was excruciating

philip kwok was a boy when the chinese 
communists broke their promise 40 years ago and seized his familys 
industrial empire in shanghai 
now hes a leading businessman in hong kong and has founded a 
prochina political party kwok assures the people of this british 
colony that what happened to his family wont happen to them when 
beijing takes over in 1997 
times have changed said kwok 52 we cant let history 
weigh us down 
tell that to jimmy mcgregor 
in 1967 the hardheaded scot then a top colonial official 
braved nail bombs and death threats to help quell 
communistinspired riots in which scores of people were killed 
today mcgregor leads a party that demands more democracy in 
hong kong and greater protection from china 
ive seen what the communists can do the 66yearold lawyer 
said they havent changed a bit 
differences between mcgregor and kwok cut to the heart of hong 
kongs big question about the future how should you deal with the 
communists 
with great deference members of kwoks liberal democratic 
foundation believe 
party members say they are willing to accept limits on freedom 
after 1997 so long as they can maintain hong kongs economic might 
a per capita annual gross national product of 9230 gives the 57 
million people on this collection of rocks the second highest 
living standard in asia after japan 
you cant avoid china kwok said it has to have a say 
to men like mcgregor the economy of hong kong rests on its 
liberties restrict the free exchange of ideas tamper with the 
independent judicial system and the economy will tremble they say 
debate will accelerate as 1997 approaches 
first under the microscope will be chinas promise in a 1984 
treaty with britain to maintain the laissezfaire economic and 
social system for 50 years and allow hong kong to govern itself 
some analysts fear china will try to manipulate the 1991 
election in which fledgling political parties will have their 
first chance at seats on the legislative council 
eighteen of the 60 seats will be filled by direct vote the 
other members will be chosen as all the seats were in the past 
either by government appointment or through elections by special 
interest groups such as teachers and businessmen 
chinawatching contemporary magazine recently reported that 
beijing will donate about 50000 to prochina candidates zhou 
nan chinas highestranking representative in hong kong has said 
it will give moral support to friends 
zhou expressed support for kwoks party in september and 
encouraged cooperation among the numerous prochina groups in hong 
kong 
an unusual alliance between business and labor resulted kwok 
and his party cemented ties with the probeijing hong kong 
federation of trade unions which instigated the 1967 riots 
mcgregor helped crush 
youd be surprised about what we have in common with those 
businessmen said leung hon hoi a trade union boss for one 
we are both very patriotic 
mcgregor views such alliances with great suspicion he likens 
trusting the communists in hong kong to trusting an untrained 
mechanic with a rolex watch 
his party the hong kong democratic foundation wants to 
insulate the territory from chinese influence it says more 
legislative seats should be elected by direct vote and laws should 
be passed to guarantee basic liberties 
in mcgregors view china understands only confrontation 
during the 1967 crisis mcgregor then an official in the 
department of commerce and industry violated protocol by closing 
the territorys procommunist schools he believed bombs were being 
made in chemistry labs 
what saved him from losing his job mcgregor said was a 
laboratory explosion that blew off a students arm 
the way to beat these men is to fight them tooth and nail 
he said 
kwok contends mcgregors pugnacious attitude could hurt the 
territory 
if you make the chinese lose face by forcing them into a 
corner they will never forget it he said we must 
cooperate 
according to kwok the territorys relationship to china is like 
a bridge game in which beijing holds the best hand 
weve got one trump card money he said they hold 
everything else if they get really mad they can turn off the 
water and the lights then where would we be 
kwok recalls growing up with stories about communist authorities 
promising his relatives they wouldnt touch the factories 
warehouses and department store in shanghai 
in the end an empire of nine textile mills one of the biggest 
department stores in shanghai and 20000 employees disappeared 
shrewd business deals in hong kong propelled the family back to 
prosperity and their wing on co is worth more than 100 million 
kwok was educated at harvard and mit where he received a doctorate 
in computer science 
the shanghai experience did not turn the family against china 
and kwok noted hong kong is different than shanghai its 
protected by an international agreement 
he and his party colleagues also have their own interests to 
protect many members are leading businessmen with substantial 
stakes in chinas development like the kwok familys company 
in early 1988 wing on completed renovating shanghais first 
great department store which opened in september 1918 the kwok 
family once owned it

while hong kongs politicians argue about the 
future most people in hong kong take little interest in politics 
the educated and welloff are worried about getting out or 
getting rich laborers and clerks are too busy working seven days a 
week trying to squeak by 
a government voterregistration drive highlighted the apathy 
many people feel about the british colonys fate after it is 
returned to china in 1997 
more than 700000 was spent on the voter registration campaign 
to pay for television ads a poster campaign and even a rock 
concert the government has held registration drives before but 
this was by far the biggest 
response was so low that the government extended the 
registration deadline by one month to nov 1 the number 
registering totaled 225000 bringing to just over 18 million the 
number of people registered less than half the territorys 37 
million eligible voters 
registering to vote pales before hong kongs burning issues 
emigration and whether lottery tickets should be sold in 
supermarkets 
becoming a voter i dont even know whether im qualified 
said lam chofai a 24yearold university graduate 
a voter has to be 21 years old and a resident of the territory 
for seven years 
i cant see the point in becoming a voter said danny yam a 
24yearold television producer it wont make any difference 
everybody here knows china is the boss and its so pointless to go 
the opposite way your boss wants 
britains last great colony passes to china in 1997 like lam 
many in the territory think china already calls the shots in hong 
kong 
many doubt chinas promise to maintain the colonys capitalist 
economic system for 50 years after it resumes control those doubts 
increased after the military crackdown on the prodemocracy 
movement in china last year 
instead of registering to vote many people are voting with 
their feet more than 1150 emigrate every week this year an 
estimated 62000 people will flee hong kong up 476 percent from 
last year 
analysts say britains colonial tradition is partly to blame for 
the indifference to politics 
after nearly 150 years of colonial rule people in hong kong 
know very little about politics because we have been discouraged to 
educate students on that subject said robert au vice chairman 
of the hong kong professional teachers union 
only recently have high school textbooks mentioned chinahong 
kong relations au said teachers say instruction on the issue 
still emphasizes memorizing information not critical thinking 
another problem is that hong kongs political system gives 
little power to elected officials most poer lies with the 
governor now appointed by britain and to be chosen by china after 
1997 
hosts of radio talk shows quite popular in hong kong say few 
of their listeners bring up politics 
we have a lot more other calls debating whether making lottery 
tickets available for sale in supermarkets would encourage gambling 
among the younger generation said lee luenfai who has a 
morning callin program 
lau chiman another host said people tend to care more about 
their own futures than the territorys future 
many people here reckon their future lies somewhere outside 
hong kong and are trying their best to find ways to emigrate lau 
said 
lately lau said his show has been overwhelmed by callers 
asking whether they qualify to emigrate 
in august the government lined up the territorys leading 
singers to encourage people to vote 
rock star anita mui told a packed house i hope youll join me 
in becoming a voter to demonstrate our support for hong kongs 
future 
one fans response thats easy for her to say she can leave 
whenever she likes

ranks of women members were a showpiece in 
the sham parliaments of communist regimes then democracy came to 
eastern europe and most of the women were gone 
a survey by the interparliamentary council in geneva found that 
all parliaments in the former soviet bloc have fewer women members 
than before communist parties fell from power last year 
the sharpest decline was in romania where women made up 34 
percent of dictator nicolae ceausescus rubberstamp assembly 
after the may elections only 4 percent of the legislators are 
women 
while under ceausescu there were quotas for skirts in the 
parliament that didnt reflect political reality said 
cristina popescu a feminist and editor of the newspaper romania 
libera newspaper now what you see is what youve got 
new issues may galvanize women poland is on the verge of 
outlawing abortion legal since 1956 but there is virtually no 
tradition of real power for them in either the communist system or 
the former opposition movements 
strong forces are holding women back 
to them falls most of the exhausting daily grind of finding a 
familys food clothing and small pleasures in shortageplagued 
economies 
social custom causes women to marry early have children 
immediately and dote on them the roman catholic church 
predominant in poland and strong elsewhere encourages a 
traditional family model and has considerable political influence 
women have virtually no organizations they can use as a basis 
for political power 
the search for equality on which western women men and 
institutions embarked 25 years ago found no mirror in the communist 
world 
communist leaders often dismissed womens lib as a foible of 
indulged immoral capitalists opposition groups did not welcome 
women to their leaderships or pursue womens issues in the battle 
against communism 
little sensitivity to womens equality is evident in the new 
democracies 
government commissions and public forums usually are menonly 
and assumptions about women are rampant a western diplomat recalls 
repeatedly explaining that she was not making an error in polish 
when she identified herself as a secretarz of her embassy not 
a secretarka on the clerical staff 
those few women in the east who would call themselves feminists 
are only beginning to look at the way schoolbooks stereotype male 
and female roles suggestions that advertisements seeking western 
investors should be addressed to executives and not 
businessmen are greeted with blank stares 
the word feminist was ridiculed the media made fun of 
western women and i didnt believe there were other women who 
believed as i did said hanna jankowska who helped found 
polands fledgling profemina group after meeting likeminded women 
at a small rally against the antiabortion law 
ms jankowska and others blame the fake equality of the 
communist system now that it has crumbled women are likely to 
retreat rather than jump at new possibilities they predict 
women did not fight for emancipation it was given to them 
with the new socialist system she said many people connect 
the two 
for many women the practical effect of this emancipation is 
they have to go to work they have two shifts at work and then for 
the home they are very tired and would prefer to stay home 
after bulgarias elections in june women made up 35 percent of 
the parliament down from 21 percent the hungarian parliament is 7 
percent female down from 21 percent before free elections 
polands parliament chosen partly by democratic elections is 
12 percent women compared with 20 percent when the communist party 
picked all candidates 
the situation in most of the postcommunist countries is more 
or less the same said izabela nowacka of the polish league of 
women a communistaligned organization now seeking an independent 
identity 
a certain number of seats were allotted to women in parliament 
and it was due to this communist system that women were allowed 
to enter government institutions but not the women who had 
something to say 
the communists also had quotas for farmers steel workers and 
miners their elimination in poland also reduced workingclass 
participation in parliament where 83 percent of members now have 
university educations compared with 60 percent previously 
no women have positions of power in solidarity which was born 
in 1980 during a gdansk shipyard strike that started over the 
firing of a female crane operator even in the textile center of 
lodz where the vast majority of mill workers are women solidarity 
always has been led by men 
when solidarity was banned in 1981 and thousands of members were 
interned under martial law women played important but supporting 
roles 
they helped activist husbands made placards and distributed 
literature their highest representation was in the underground 
press where many wrote under male pseudonyms 
only two women were among the 57 participants in talks between 
solidarity and the communists that laid the groundwork for the 
transfer of power in 1989 just one woman minister in charge of 
culture serves in the new government 
the antiabortion campaign a product of solidaritys close 
alignment with the church conservative nationalism and all things 
anticommunist has roused some women 
for the first time in postwar poland women became aware that 
their rights are in danger ms jankowska said we are at the 
very beginning of organizing women in this country it is a 
difficult task but this abortion issue has awakened women 
generally however there is little optimism for substantially 
increased involvement or professional advancement by this 
generation of women in eastern europe 
winners of polish parliament seats were very much connected 
with the church and the traditional model of family said dr 
zofia kuratowska deputy senate speaker and one of the few ranking 
women in solidarity 
she said the spring elections probably will produce an even more 
conservative assembly after a battle among fledgling parties in 
which women have little place 
ms kuratowska noted that women comprised only about 10 percent 
of candidates in the may local elections municipal contests often 
are a starting point for political activists 
worn down by work shopping and child care women appear likely 
to succumb to the widespread eastern european attitude that the 
authorities will do whatever they want in the end 
activists say many women already have retreated into their 
private lives tuning out the political system 
a woman can only influence public life after she has done the 
shopping the laundry put the children to bed eva uhrova said 
in the meantime men who have this time to themselves can 
devote it to politics said ms uhrova editor of a womens 
magazine in czechoslovakia where women hold 6 percent of the 
parliament seats compared with 29 percent under the communists 
women who were asked whether they wanted to advance

jean kahn president of the representative council of jewish 
institutions in france issued a statement in august saying 
manifestations of antisemitism in france have sometimes been 
overdramatized in other countries 
we feel this is not justified because it does not reflect 
french reality the statement added except for the tragic 
period of 193945the jews of france for the last 200 years have 
been completely integrated into the national community 
crozier says the jewish element is part of the french 
identity as it is part of the american identity we can accept 
anyone provided he accepts our culture thats why the moslems are 
such a problem they have a culture of their own which we do not 
recognize 
some sociologists and others say this sense of insecurity 
explains the rise of the extremeright national front party of 
jeanmarie le pen le pen contends that traditional french values 
are being corrupted by foreign influences 
le pen who wants to deport north african immigrants says 
france risks becoming an arabicspeaking moslem nation if 
immigration is not stemmed 
the national front the most powerful farright group in europe 
consistently holds about 15 percent of the electorate 
france inherited its moslem population mainly north african 
from its disintegrating colonial empire thousands were lured 
across the mediterranean from 1960 to 1975 to man the factories 
during an economic boom 
tinroofed shantytowns that sprung up around major cities to 
house the workers eventually were razed to make way for concrete 
apartment buildings cut off from city life illmanaged and 
deteriorating these highrise complexes remain the principal 
source of housing for immigrant families 
this is a basic problem which will weigh for years on our 
society said president francois mitterrand in response to 
october riots in a lowcost housing complex outside lyon the 
projects provoke rejection despair and make dialogue 
difficult 
at the moment its hard to find a real frenchman said a 
35yearold algerian theyre all rich and removed 
the algerian who refused to give his name owns the cafe balzac 
at the corner of two housing complexes near vitry south of paris 
he has lived in france since he was a baby but refuses to exercise 
his right to become a french citizen 
they exploited my parents they have done nothing for me he 
said we are badly viewed so why accept something they dont 
really want to give you i have my pride 
many algerians feel they are an unwanted reminder of the 
inglorious eightyear war france vainly waged to keep algeria a 
colony 
france tried early on to rid itself of what clearly was becoming 
the immigrant burden arranging to pay off workers and their 
families willing to return to their homeland the program largely 
failed and officials now grope for ways to promote cultural 
integration 
the immigrant question shares the political agenda with the 
new europe an interloper of another sort 
france has been a driving force toward unity challenging the 
european community to go beyond the open frontiers of 1992 toward 
political union 
but the bravado masks worries that are particularly french how 
to remain rigorously independent in an interdependent community of 
nations and retain the national identity that is it often seems 
frances raison detre 
france currently is facing its most profound identity crisis 
since the advent of the fifth republic in 1958 according to 
gregory flynn a european affairs specialist with the carnegie 
endowment for international peace in washington 
the french he wrote in the wall street journal fear for 
identity more than security and worry about losing all traces of 
their status as a world power 
france appears wellplaced to assume a leadership role in a 
united europe but questions arise about its willingness to 
suppress its nationalistic instincts 
everything is happening as though the french no longer able 
to change the world or protect themselves from it persuaded 
themselves that as a nation they can do nothing at all says the 
governmentordered report on the state of the nation 
the french have long sought to protect their national identity 
politically and culturally the report says from now on they 
will have to choose other criteria for success 
many experts are optimistic 
todd a member of the government panel says france has far more 
confidence now than a few decades ago when the folly of grandeur 
a perverse national obsession bolstered a humiliated nation 
france is one of the european countries changing most 
quickly todd says so its normal that some people have 
doubts nostalgia dream of a peaceful and tranquil france 
crozier says you dont redefine what is french its not an 
intellectual operation its something that just happens

when other children across america are sleeping 
late 48 kids from baltimore and surrounding counties are in 
saturday school dissecting coconuts and scrutinizing current 
events 
the goal to teach them how to think 
nineyearold ayanna harrison reasoned that the swimming death 
of a 15yearold boy with asthma could have been avoided had he 
been honest with his mother 
she might have kept him home or sent a note to school to 
excuse him from swimming if she had known there would be a swimming 
test that day ayanna told her classmates as they closely 
examined a newspaper article about the accident 
that mother didnt think much about him and made him go 
said paul weinberg 10 fingering a paragraph saying the youth 
begged his mother to let him stay home but unaware that he 
faced a swimming test she told him to go to school and get good 
grades 
the mother in fact has said she sent a note to school asking 
that the child be excused from swimming that day 
in two nearby classrooms teachers linda mcclelland and sally 
duff used coconuts to guide sixth and seventh graders in the art of 
observing the biggest problem for the youngsters was finding the 
patience to completely examine the outside before smashing the 
coconut to get the juice and meat discussing the best possible way 
to open the coconut took time too 
and teacher thomas payne explored genetic engineering with his 
eighth and ninth graders to help them formulate meaningful 
questions identify pertinent data and determine fallacies and 
biases 
these youngsters are participating in the saturday school 
program twice a month at coppin state college home of the maryland 
center for thinking studies considered the first of its kind in 
the country the program teaches students how to think in a 
variety of ways not what to think 
we do not teach math or engineering or science or social 
studies said director toni worsham we teach children how to 
solve problems how to make decisions how to become less 
impulsive how not to jump to conclusions and how to be creative 
and look for other possibilities and we deal with real issues 
the national education goals developed by president bush and the 
nations governors stress the importance that students 
particularly college graduates demonstrate an advanced ability 
to think critically communicate effectively and solve problems 
after a year of planning and writing curriculum the saturday 
school opened in september 1989 with about 43 students from 
baltimore and surrounding counties some traveled from as far as 75 
miles to participate this year 48 students are participating the 
goal is to gradually expand to 200 youngsters from kindergartenthrough 
12th grade grouped into classes of 10 to 12 students 
diversity is a priority there are wealthy students and poor 
students blacks and whites hispanics and asians kids from both 
urban and rural backgrounds the students are not necessarily 
gifted 
tuition is 200 a year but scholarships are offered to eligible 
students unable to pay the center has a 100000 state grant and a 
federal grant that varies each year but was approved for 100000 
this year 
on a recent saturday the fourth and fifth graders worked in 
teams pairs and squares to solve problems and make 
predictions teacher mary ellen beatyoferrall coached the groups 
through the frustrating moments that came when each persons 
opinion had to be repeated and considered 
the sixth and seventh graders had to overcome their impatience 
to get done with the outside examination of the coconut and to 
smash it to get at the insides they also took a lot of time 
discussing how best to open it up 
i will never think of a coconut the same way again declared 
12yearold tatiana bareis 
worsham said the most critical issue facing educators today is 
students lack of adequate thinking skills to solve problems or 
make decisions 
although research has shown that nearly all students beyond the 
age of 12 should be able to reason at the formal operational level 
less than 40 percent of high school graduates are able to 
demonstrate higherlevel thinking skills 
at the center active cooperative learning is stressed 
students are encouraged to reflect on their own thinking and to 
learn to manage how they think 
i like being able to teach things that dont necessarily fall 
under the category of a particular discipline said payne who 
works for howard county public schools i like most being able to 
create our own curriculum to have that flexibility is really a 
treat 
duff an instructional specialist in health and science for 
baltimore city public schools said she also enjoys writing 
curriculum and was tickled about the success of the coconut 
curriculum she developed 
school ought to be fun and thinking ought to be fun said 
duff its very exciting to me to think what our kids can do when 
they become thoughtful and aware of themselves as thinkers it 
enhances their selfesteem they feel competent theyre willing to 
be critical politely we hope but still to think independently 
ive seen it happen with my students it makes all the difference 
anita stockton curriculum director said parents receive 
progress reports twice a year but the focus is on the progression 
and growth of the students 
nobody can fail explained stockton a science specialist 
for the maryland state department of education all of our 
students make progress some make greater progress than others 
the students arrive at the saturday school as early as 915 am 
to participate in enrichment activities 30 minutes before class 
there is the weird facts room where youngsters search through 
books that describe unusual phenomena the writing lab or the 
computer rooms where 12 machines are available for students 
interested in solving logic problems 
the threehour class sessions end with a debriefing period 
where students analyze the days activities while completing 
specially designed charts 
the teachers part of a parttime staff that work only on 
saturdays spend 30 minutes after class writing in journals during 
a structured think time before joining together for their own 
debriefing and curriculum review 
the drawback to the program 
after a long pause sin kei yeung 13 blurted why do you 
have to come here so early its saturday you like to sleep 
late

neither nadine gordimer nor jm coetzee spent 
much time researching their new novels they are south africans 
and the setting of their books the world of apartheid police 
raids and rebellion is right in front of them 
to write in south africa means to have your subjects chosen for 
you gordimer notes the problems are simply too great to avoid 
but she and coetzee differed greatly in recent interviews on what a 
writer could and should do about them 
its a matter of personalities as well as philosophies the 
contrast between the outgoing committed gordimer and the shy more 
skeptical coetzee a debate on the power of art for arts sake 
between two of south africas most acclaimed white writers 
the creative act is not pure gordimer once wrote history 
evidences it ideology demands it society exacts it one thing 
is clear ours is a period when few can claim the absolute value of 
a writer without reference to a context of responsibilities 
just 5foot1 she has high cheekbones playful eyes and a long 
thin nose her voice is small her diction precise 
the 67yearold author works in the tradition of such 
politically minded south african writers as alan paton and athol 
fugard her characters are adventurers travelers participants 
people forced to make difficul choices between political 
commitment and personal responsibilties 
in her new novel my sons story farrar straus amp giroux 
1995 sonny is a married black man who falls in love with a 
fellow activist a white woman 
hillela the hero of her 1987 novel a sport of nature 
leaves family and friends behind as she comes of age emotionally 
and politicallyburgers daughter banned for three months in 
south africa upon its release in 1979 details the struggles of the 
daughter of the late south african communist party leader 
these are searing experiences gordimer said and all 
sorts of things can happen 
we tend to look down on people who are not like us especially 
in revolutionary situations i think sometimes you have people 
good people trying to do the right thing but not having the courage 
to go far enough on the other side we have people who tried to 
ignore whats going on 
while gordimer writes of collaboration coetzee is obsessed with 
solitude he is quiet with a gray goatee and soft eyes he waits 
several seconds before answering his responses coming in full 
wellconstructed sentences as if the delay was necessary for 
lastminute editing 
his books are brief usually under 200 pages and intense the 
author knows it takes less time to prepare a meal if you turn up 
the heat in the life and times of michael k waiting for the 
barbarians and others he writes of innocents outcasts and 
guiltridden government officials men and women doing their best 
to duck under history or simply float above it 
age of iron random house 1895 reads like a single 
sustained thought the book is narrated by mrs curren a classics 
professor dying of cancer her husband is dead her daughter has 
moved away and her closest companion is a homeless man she brings 
in from the street 
tragedy pushes gordimers characters into action but coetzees 
people become more withdrawn mrs curren does not initiate events 
she reacts to them the author writes of mrs curren standing over 
the bleeding body of her servants son who has been shot by 
police 
it was blood nothing more blood like yours and mine yet 
never before had i seen anything so scarlet and so black perhaps 
it was an effect of the skin youthful supple velvet dark over 
which it ran but on my hands it seemed both darker and more 
glaring than blood ought to be i stared at it fascinated afraid 
drawn into a veritable stupor of staring 
says the 50yearold coetzee our history is such that all of 
a sudden ordinary people are confronted with major decisions in a 
way that ordinary people are usually not faced by i think south 
africa in the past 40 years has been a place where people have been 
faced with really huge moral debts 
but what is the value of fiction in south africa a country 
where political responsiblities make introspection seem 
selfindulgent almost treasonous gordimer a member of the 
african national congress believes fiction has subversive power 
that imagining a revolution can make it more likely to happen 
in a sport of nature she concludes with hillela and others 
attending a joyous ceremony proclaiming the birth of a new african 
state the book was written before the release of nelson mandela 
and many other political prisoners 
its strange because when all of those prisoners came out in 
october of last year for the first time in many many years there 
was this enormous rally gordimer said it was somehow a dress 
rehearsal for what was in sport of nature there were our leaders 
parading around in this tremendous surge of exhilaration 
coetzee is more cautious wary of predicting any postapartheid 
utopia and unsure novels can keep up with current events he 
closely follows politics but does not see fiction as the ideal way 
to write about it 
i dont think the novel is the most effective way to intervene 
in the daily processes of political life he said writing a 
novel takes too long publishing a novel takes too long novels are 
read by too few people they dont have that direct kind of 
involvement with political reality that newspapers have 
gordimer sees fiction writers as the best kind of reporters 
combining technical skills with political and psychological 
insight taking an interest in the news of the day and conducting 
exhaustive research of their characters inner lives 
the writers powers of observation are more acute the writers 
of fiction often see in the behavior of people which way theyre 
probably going to go she said this applies to all societies 
if you live there all the time you can see what might happen and 
sometimes youre right

the graffiti was printed neatly in black 
ink on a bathroom stall in a cafe in due west sc 
i aint never gonna love nobody but cornell crawford it 
declared 
when kt oslin read it she chuckled then pondering its 
directness and determination she knew she had a song the result 
is cornell crawford one of oslins songs in her third country 
music album love in a small town 
cut after cut the themes and emotions are from everyday 
ordinary life and hit special chords within the listener 
it is her first lp in two years a rather long hiatus for 
country music so this normally gutsy singersongwriter confesses 
to a touch of trepidation 
if you dont put out an album every year you can be dead 
meat the 48yearold performer said in an interview as she 
munched on bread and brie 
well see but i dont think you become dead meat until you 
are doing inferior work or mediocre work 
based on her previous records oslin has little reason to worry 
her albums 80s ladies and this woman both sold more than 
1 million copies 
she won three grammy awards during a meteoric rise in country 
music in 1988 she unseated reba mcentire as the country music 
associations female vocalist of the year mcentire had won the 
honor four straight years 
now oslin offers love in a small town an album weaving 
songs of wry amusement emotional strength nostalgia and 
loneliness 
the lps cut come next monday is about a woman vowing to end 
a relationship oowee is about staying home from work and 
frolicking mary and willie is about two people with no love 
interests in their life 
love is strange is oslins remake of a 1956 rhythm and blues 
hit by mickey amp sylvia kenny rogers and dolly parton also recently 
recorded it 
oslins crooning my sweet babe youre the one has 
almost as much feeling as an embrace 
and cornell crawford inspired by the writing on a toilet 
wall tells of dedication for the man who makes sparks fly 
we all wish we had a cornell crawford oslin mused about the 
song ive been doing it in the live show for two years and it 
gets some of the best response of anything people are intrigued 
about someone that emphatic the sincerity of it struck me 
she wrote or cowrote seven of the nine cuts and plays keyboard 
on every song 
kay toinette oslin was born in crossitt ark but spent most of 
her early years in mobile ala as a teenager she settled in 
houston ending up in new york she was a chorus girl in theatrical 
productions and then turned to work as a studio backup vocalist and 
ad jingle singer 
she also showed a flair for songwriting an aunt lent her 7000 
to finance a nashville showcase performance which caught the 
attention of rca records she signed an rca recording contract in 
1986 at a time when most record companies were looking for singers 
almost half her age 
oslin became one of nashvilles most intriguing personalities 
launching a new career in her mid40s and writing songs from the 
perspective of a strong woman her hit singles included do ya 
two hearts hey bobby didnt expect it to go down this 
way and this woman 
i was different she said 
she also was outspoken she has said candidly that she hated 
country music when she grew up 
when i listened to country music in the 50s it was almost 
all males who seemed very old and sang about drinking and cheating 
on their wives or girlfriends a 15yearold does not relate to 
that oslin said 
fortunately it has changed and people who say today that 
they dont like country music probably havent listened to it 
some of it i like today some of it i dont i dont like the 
real twangy hard core straight ahead old style country music i 
like some of it but on a steady diet no 
her current album is not her only new project she just recorded 
a duet with barry manilow baby its cold outside which will 
be on his next album 
oslin also has received considerable attention for her music 
video of come next monday in it she portrays the bride of 
frankenstein 
it has nothing at all to do with the song she explained 
i thought it was time to show that i had a sense of humor my 
videos have all been great but rather serious we just went the 
crazy route its hilarious

tie me up tie me down will carry the new 
nc17 rating when it is released by rcacolumbia pictures home 
video on dec 12 
the provocative comedy by spanish filmmaker pedro almodovar was 
given an x rating by the ratings board of the motion picture 
association of america when it was released theatrically earlier 
this year because of the films sexual content however the x 
rating was replaced by the new nc17 no one under 17 admitted in 
september when philip kaufman appealed the xrating for his movie 
henry amp june 
most theaters refused to show movies with x ratings regardless 
of artistic merits because they were associated with hardcore 
pornography 
vidmarks the cook the thief his wife amp her lover was the 
first video to be released with the new rating when it hit stores 
on oct 17 it had been slated for an rrated version and an 
unrated version 
tie me up tie me down almodovars seventh film tells the 
story of a former mental patient who kidnaps a pornographic film 
star and exaddict who eventually falls in love with him 
his women on the verge of a nervous breakdown has grossed 
nearly 30 million in worldwide sales and is the biggest boxoffice 
hit in spanish history 
rcacolumbia will release the video in vhs and beta format at a 
suggested retail price of 8995 it will have subtitles 
in other video news avision entertainment atlantic records 
new home video subsidiary will release mandela in america on 
nov 20 
the video is a montage of the south african leaders journey 
across the united states and has interviews with such celebrities 
as jane fonda spike lee sen edward kennedy and new york gov 
mario cuomo 
 
gremlins 2 the new batch warner home video 9295 rated 
pg13 
 
a successful sequel usually requires strong and interesting 
characters or unique and compelling situations or the sequel 
simply has to be better than the original 
with gremlins 2 the new batch the most exciting characters 
arent human and the situation would be compelling and scary if it 
werent so silly this time around the mutant mogwai trash a 
computerized office building in new york gulp down vials of 
experimental genetic drugs and leave a trail of green slime 
garbage and confusion 
gizmo has been living peacefully with his keeper mr wing keye 
luke the wise and mysterious man who first introduced the little 
critter in gremlins daniel clamp a sendup of donald trump 
is a greedy developer who wants wings little curiosity shop in 
chinatown so he can build yet another sprawling steel and cement 
monstrosity but wing wont sell 
when wing dies clamp sends in the wreckers ball gizmo flees 
only to be scooped up by one of clamps reseachers from the 
companys genetics lab 
billy peltzer zach galligan also works for clamp hes the 
naive trusting lad whose father gave him gizmo as a cute present 
billys true love kate phoebe cates is a tour guide in the 
building 
billy rescues gizmo just as the deranged dr catheter 
christopher lee is about to dissect him but billy who knows how 
mogwais can dangerously mutate goes out to dinner with his pushy 
boss marla and stupidly leaves gizmo alone in his desk drawer 
telling the creature that someone will pick him up 
gizmo of course doesnt stay put he gets splashed by water 
which triggers the birth of mutations who take things a step 
further and become those obnoxious and evil little uglies who just 
about did in billys hometown this time they take over clamp 
center and threaten to take manhattan 
clamps empire is shredded from his microwave marge tv 
show to the genetics lab the microwave is a campy allusion to the 
original movie in which billys mom nuked a bad gremlin 
there are other campy nuggets as well gizmo as rambo clamp and 
marla as in marla maples trumps amour vampire bats and 
christopher lee one of cinemas most famous count draculas 
billy kate and their visiting neighbors from kingston falls put 
an end to a gremlin takeover 
dont look for chills and thrills though the bad mogwais are 
more comic than evil theres a hyper bugeyed critter a 
rubylipped vamp and an intellectual who plans to lead his brethern 
to broadway shows and the best restaurants in towns gremlins love 
to eat 
gremlins 2 is big on frenzy and mess its also good for a 
sincere laugh or two but the uniqueness of the creatures is gone 
even gizmo is no longer precious but simply ordinary 
the snow white scene in the original movie was priceless so 
was the constant yumyum the sequel has none of those quirky 
inventions 
the creature crew is to be commended for the special effects and 
for the mogwai manipulation and the support cast adds a much 
needed luster especially lee dick miller and jackie joseph as mr 
and mrs futterman and robert prosky as grandpa fred a tv 
personality who is host of a latenight horror movie show 
cates and galligan merely lend a bland sweetness 
if its a rainy saturday get this one for the kids theyll 
love it

the years between his landmark movie easy 
rider and his recent return to film prominence were a waste 
says dennis hopper 
the drugs and alcohol that i was involved with stopped me from 
working stopped me from being creative the problem with being an 
alcoholic and a drug addict is that you dont think its happening 
you dont know that youre addicted and dont admit that youre 
addicted its always somebody elses fault that youre not 
working he said 
those were wasted years ive directed six movies now i 
should have directed 20 its unfortunate because all that was 
ever important to me was the work i justified my own addictions 
because i was an artist and all the great artists of course 
were drug addicts and alcoholics because of that stupidity i 
dont yet have a body of work that i consider important 
hopper is striving to make up for lost time his sixth film as a 
director the hot spot starring don johnson has been released 
to hot and cold reviews and soso business 
while not in the scorsesespielbergpollack range of directors 
he has no trouble finding employment particularly for 
hardtextured works such as his sensationcausing colors which 
was blamed for scattered theater violence and the current film a 
study of sex and crime in a small texas town 
this is a departure for me he said i actually used a 
novel by charles williams you might say we were of like mind he 
wrote the book in 1951 it was published in 1952 then in 1962 he 
wrote a screenplay with nona tyson it was intended for robert 
mitchum 
i found that script and updated it to now its about an 
amoral drifter johnson who comes to a small town in texas and 
sells cars its a throwback to the filmnoir dark movie a 
pulp novel its fun i like it 
johnson finds himself caught between two women an oversexed 
schemer virginia madsen and an innocent young beauty jennifer 
connelly who is also manipulative he also gets involved in 
bankrobbing blackmail and murder all the good stuff 
hopper considered other stars before deciding on johnson late 
of miami vice 
i edited the movie for a year and now i cant imagine anyone 
else playing the role said the director people should really 
look at him as a force to be dealt with in movies he could be a 
major star theres a place there for him 
hopper found madsen while watching television via a satellite 
dish during the filming of flashback in which he acted but did 
not direct he saw her as a throwback to lana turner perfect for 
the femme fatale role he remembered connelly from her role as a 
12yearold ballet dancer in once upon a time in america he 
considers her more beautiful than elizabeth taylor and a better 
actress 
hopper talked about the notices for the hot spot and said 
its getting some good stuff and some bad stuff but i think that 
runs with the territory its a hot movie but then ive always 
gotten widely divergent reviews starting with easy rider 
colors out of the blue also it sort of follows me around 
like a pet snake 
nothing in hoppers background provided any hint of his later 
notoriety he was born in kansas in 1936 and spent much of his 
youth on his grandparents farm five miles from dodge city his 
parents moved to san diego where hopper won a scholarship to the 
old globe theater a taste of shakespeare emboldened him to try 
hollywood and he landed a sevenyear contract at warner bros 
hopper appeared in some impressive films rebel without a 
cause giant true grit and the sons of katie elder 
after a few lowbudget biker films with peter fonda the pair 
combined their forces in easy rider the films gritty realism 
revolutionized the industry its success also contributed to 
hoppers 15year tailspin 
hopper savors his new life im married to dancer katherine 
lanasa 31 years his junior i have a new son henry lee born in 
september i have two daughters the 17yearold just entered 
college my 28yearold is involved in film development here i 
couldnt be happier the work is good and i just want to keep 
working those are the important things 
hopper probably will never shed his reputation as a worldclass 
hellraiser of the 60s and 70s just recently a new york tabloid 
captioned a photograph bad boy actordirector dennis hopper 
 
is he a bad boy 
no i dont think so said the filmmaker who resembled a 
stockbroker in his expensively tailored suit maybe a bad 
gentleman 
he shrugged off such references to his past im not rushing 
to get out of it seems harmless enough doesnt it

general director ardis krainik is steering the 
lyric opera of chicago into the 21st century and she feels the way 
to reach the wild blue yonder is to stay in the black 
once again this year the woman who told luciano pavarotti his 
services were no longer needed in chicago has come up with an 
operatic marvel rarer than a superstar tenor its called solvency 
we havent had a deficit since 1981 and for the second year 
in a row our entire season was sold out by opening night lyric 
spokeswoman susan mathieson said our ticket sales will top 11 
million our fundraising goal for the year is 795 million and 
were right on target for that too 
the current eightopera season at lyric which began sept 14 
is the first of a decadelong initiative miss krainik has dubbed 
toward the 21st century its a program meant to showcase 
oftenoverlooked 20th century operatic works reshape productions 
of more traditional operas and most importantly point the way 
to the future 
that future as miss krainik sees it is our own unique 
american opera not just a hashedover european art form 
chicagos first taste of what such opera might be came oct 27 
when lyric presented its first production of minnesota composer 
dominick argentos 1976 work the voyage of edgar allan poe 
although argentos hallucinatory opera had been performed 
before both in the united states and europe it had never received 
a fullscale production in a major house until miss krainik hired 
pulitzer prizewinning director frank galati to realize it on the 
lyric stage 
the opening night audience greeted poe with wild applause 
and multiple curtain calls an enthusiastic response for a complex 
tale filled with death madness and suggestions of necrophilia 
appropriately poe was still running over halloween and the 
timing reflects the canny krainik strategy that has sold out the 
3564seat civic opera house for every performance in recent years 
that strategy mixes innovation superstar vehicles and old 
favorites 
the 1990 season began with soprano jessye normans chicago 
debut which came in a work so old it was new glucks 1767 
alceste the 18th century music was juxtaposed against robert 
wilsons ultramodern set designs and costumes the first production 
he had done for an american opera house 
alceste caused grumbling among some audience members who 
complained of the lack of englishlanguage supertitles that have 
become standard under miss krainicks management 
all other lyric productions this season have supertitles 
including poe which is sung in english 
after alceste lyrics season moved to the mid19th century 
sumptuousness of tchaikovskys eugene onegin and on into the 
early 20th century with puccinis girl of the golden west the 
puccini work gave tenor placido domingo a chance to revel in the 
spaghetti western role of johnson di sacramento and to romance 
the keeper of the polka saloon 
then came poe complete with premature burial a pendulum 
and a masque of the red death 
reds not a color we like around here financially but its 
fine for costumes ms mathieson commented 
the rest of lyrics 199091 season is more traditional fare 
lucia di lammermoor rigoletto and carmen will span the 
thanksgivingtochristmas period and a reworking of its acclaimed 
19856 the magic flute will appear in january 
miss krainik has not announced the 19912 portion of toward 
the 21st century but she says composer william bolcom is 
preparing mcteague an operatic version of frank norris 1899 
naturalistic novel as the centerpiece of the 19923 season 
mcteague is to be staged by film director robert altman who 
will be tackling the same material erich von stroheim used for his 
silent movie epic greed 
the 19923 season also will feature the beginning of an even 
more ambitious project a remounting of richard wagners monumental 
ring cycle zubin mehta is scheduled to conduct one of the four 
ring operas each season until 1996 the entire cycle is to be 
performed again in the spring of that year 
miss krainik says world premieres of two other operas will occur 
in the 19967 and 19992000 seasons and both will be by american 
composers 
its a major departure from the views of miss krainiks late 
predecessor lyric founder carol fox whose predilection for 
european works and singers earned the chicago company the nickname 
of la scala west 
miss foxs idea of a tribute to the us bicentennial was to 
commission polish composer kryzystof penderecki and british 
playwright christopher fry to do an operatic version of john 
miltons paradise lost that work had its premiere two years 
late in 1978 with sets designed to fit the stage of milans la 
scala not chicago 
paradise lost cost a reported 2 million and added to the 
sea of red ink that threatened to drown lyric by 1980 in that 
year lyrics board persuaded the ailing miss fox to step down 
after 26 years and elevated miss krainik who had been artistic 
director since 1975

more than two decades in the music business both 
as a disc jockey and a performer have given peter wolf a certain 
maturity sort of 
i tend to wear longer socks now he jokes and i look both 
ways before i cross the street 
but seriously the former j geils band frontman has been 
struggling since the 1983 breakup of the group to strike out on his 
own 
his mostrecent solo album up to no good was a critical 
success but did not sell well now hes planning a tour to show 
people hes still around 
i havent done it in eight years wolf said the beatles 
were together and broke up in less time than that in rock n 
roll its a millennium 
with j geils wolfs athletic antics onstage became as well 
known as some of the bands songs including love stinks and 
centerfold then at the height of the groups popularity it 
was announced that wolf was leaving 
wolf said hes still bitter about the breakup but added it 
hasnt crushed his spirit 
i became a soloist really not by choice but it was the only 
way a necessity to keep on rock n rollin because i loved the 
band and i really would have liked to see the band stay together 
he said 
it was like someone who would have liked to see their marriage 
stay together but there just wasnt any reason to hang in there 
still persistent rumors abound surrounding a j geils reunion 
especially every new years eve when the band used to play its 
annual bash in boston wolf is pessimistic about the prospects 
the geils band we were a family sort of like a bunch of 
brothers sticking together through thick and thin it just was hard 
to try to keep that collective spirit he said people wonder 
if the band is ever going to get back together i really have no 
set plans to do it the only way i would do it is if i really felt 
that kind of spirit could be regained 
recently in a posh boston hotel suite he took to meet the 
press wolf looked unchanged from years of musical mayhem the hair 
may be shorter but wolf 42 remains painfully thin adorned with 
eyeliner and dressed completely in black his wit still is sharp 
wolf grew up in the bronx his father was an entertainer his 
mother a political activist and the eclectic home life gave him 
inspiration to be an artist so he relocated to boston in his early 
20s to pursue painting 
but art fell by the wayside when wolf became the overnight disc 
jockey at bostons wbcnfm and caught the music bug it was there 
that he met fellow musician van morrison 
van used to live in cambridge and he used to listen and 
thats how we become friends he used to come by and we ended up 
doing gigs together wolf said my band opened up for him and 
we toured around new england together in station wagons 
in 1967 the j geils band was born taking its name from the 
lead guitarist along the way there were moderate album sales a 
string of gigs opening for the rolling stones and the eventual 
success of the 1982 album freeze frame which sold 5 million 
copies 
but then came the unexpected breakup with the band citing 
creative differences for the split 
wolf said he still prefers the group atmosphere rather than 
taking the risky solo route 
i really enjoy being in a band i enjoy the responsibility i 
enjoy sharing things i enjoy the collaborative sense of it he 
said its a lot tougher being a soloist theres a lot more 
demands all the focus is on one individual im still not used to 
that 
wolf made two solo lp before up to no good this time around 
he decided to venture into unfamiliar territory for a rock n 
roller nashville 
many people think of it as just a country town but theres a 
lot of good rock n rollers down there and theres a lot of 
studios he said so i thought it would be interesting to see 
what it would be like to record outside of a big urban city like 
new york or la once i started spending some time there i really 
liked it 
he says the slogan on up to no good is a quote from a john 
lee hooker song if its in you its got to come out sums up 
his feeling about getting older the business and his own 
personality 
to me rock n roll is infectious in the sense that you 
sometimes cant control it its something thats beyond the 
senses he said 
youve got to really have that desire as long as its there 
you can keep on rocking 
wolf was in boston in october conducting interviews for 
prospective band members the tour which does not have a firm 
opening date will likely take on small intimate clubs and 
despite the years wolf said hes confident that on the tour he can 
live up to the frantic stage persona he had with j geils 
no one questions frank sinatra who started out as a 
bobbysocks idol no one says can he still be singing 
witchcraft when hes 67 obviously he can because hes in his 
70s and still doing concerts wolf said 
but wolf adds that he doesnt have plans to mellow 
i dont think im going to be perry como in a sweater holding 
a pipe

the ozzie and harriet version of the american 
family is nearly extinct but the social security system designed 
around it is much the same as a result women are the losers 
married working women usually earn no more social security 
retirement than if theyd never worked a day most divorced women 
get only half the benefits earned by their former husbands 
women who become widowed in their 50s face up to 10 years 
without any death benefit checks 
these inequities have been acknowledged since the mid1970s but 
reforms went nowhere because the system went through a financial 
crisis tax increases passed in the early 1980s have prompted 
renewed calls for reform 
two house subcommittees are considering legislation a task 
force appointed by social security commissioner gwendolyn king is 
working on its own bill 
i think we have a responsibility to at least look at whether 
were serving the needs of families in this country in the 21st 
century king said in an interview at social security 
headquarters in baltimore 
the older womens league an advocacy group explains the 
problem in dollars 
the average monthly social security retirement benefit for women 
in 1989 was roughly threequarters of that paid to men 488 
compared to 639 according to the league 
compounding the problem by 2030 only one in three women over 
65 will be married compared with 40 percent today 
more and more women will be living in poverty said joan 
kurianski director of the older womens league 
two factors put working women at a disadvantage they usually 
earn less than men and they often stop working to care for children 
or elderly relatives 
the system gives these women a difficult choice 
they can base their social security check on their own earnings 
or they can get a check equal to half their husbands benefits 
because their earned benefit is usually lower than the 50 percent 
spousal benefit the years they worked and paid taxes go for 
naught 
divorced women unless theyve earned high incomes themselves 
get only the 50 percent spousal benefit and then only if theyve 
been married 10 years 
reform advocates also bemoan what they call the widows gap a 
quirk in the system that can put widows in their 50s in poverty 
while they are too old to begin most careers social security 
wont pay death benefits until age 60 because they dont have young 
children faced with relatively paltry retirement checks women 
must make do in other ways 
lucille leffall 65 is a retired beautician in baltimore who is 
twice divorced and now gets 300 per month social security she 
works part time at a senior citizens center and depends on her 
daughter and soninlaw for help 
without that leffall said i would get married again i guess 
if i could find the right person who would go along with my way 
of thinking 
mary gray 75 also of baltimore worked 14 years in a doughnut 
shop and became widowed at 57 her social security check now totals 
437 she lives in a rentsubsidized apartment but still has to 
juggle to meet expenses 
i was raised during the depression and you realized then that 
sometimes you just didnt get what you wanted she said 
one proposal to equalize benefits between men and women is 
called earnings sharing the total lifetime wages of a husband and 
wife are combined then divided to compute each persons retirement 
check 
the principle is marriage is an economic partnership and even 
if im not in the paid labor force im contributing to the 
marriage said laurel beeden a researcher for the american 
association of retired persons 
but earnings sharing cuts benefits to some people such as 
divorced men so its never gotten far in congress rep mary rose 
oakar dohio has tried to solve these inequities with earnings 
sharing legislation that prohibits anyones benefits from dropping 
although this would drastically increase the cost oakar says 
the social security trust fund can afford it 
if you did the whole bill in one fell swoop it would cost in 
the neighborhood of 30 billion a year but remember as we speak 
we have about 90 billion in the trust fund and by the year 2000 
they say it will be up to about 1 trillion 
a less ambitious proposal by rep thomas tauke riowa would 
allow women to take up to 10 years out of the work force to 
care for children or relatives with no loss in retirement benefits 
allow widows who are ineligible to receive benefits until age 
60 to get them at 55 
allow divorcing women to negotiate in court for part of their 
husbands social security benefits 
king however doubts the system can afford either plan her 
task force is trying to reform the system without new spending or 
taxes a goal she says may be reached at the expense of some 
peoples benefits

millions of americans tune in weekly to 
hear walter red barber on national public radio 24 years after 
he signed off his final broadcast of a new york yankees game 
it has meant arising three hours earlier than normal since 1981 
when the live friday segment became a fixture that includes 
glimpses of history or personal insights 
i dont enjoy getting up at 545 on friday mornings but i 
enjoy doing it he said its something i look forward to 
although barber usually discusses sports with npr morning 
edition host bob edwards he is comfortable with nearly any 
subject 
listeners like to know what the weather is in tallahassee and 
whats in bloom he said basically its what i want to say 
and it gives me pleasure that goes back to radio in its beginning 
days 
barber 82 also likes to bring listeners up to date on other 
oldtimers often noting the death of former players umpires or 
journalists along with a personal comment on his association with 
them 
barbers relationship with npr began in december 1980 after the 
death of elston howard the yankees first black player since 
barber had broadcast yankees games during most of howards career 
he was a natural 
they asked for two or three minutes of my thoughts about 
howard barber said 
a month later npr asked barber if he was interested in a weekly 
taped program he insisted on a live format and refuses most 
interview requests that arent live 
the thing about the show that is attractive is that its 
completely spontaneous said barber as i sit there the 
pleasure i get is being myself 
the show edwards said has become the most popular on morning 
edition generating thousands of letters from listeners 
the biggest complaint we get about the bit a 3minute 
segment is its too short red cant really tell a long story 
said edwards he is the star of the show the network 
last month barber and edwards broadcast the show together for 
the first time in a fundraiser for the public station at florida 
state university in tallahassee 
this will be a little easier for me because im a little hard 
of hearing and now i can read your lips barber told edwards 
their friday show on morning edition has always been through 
a telephone hookup between edwards at nprs washington studios and 
barbers home 
we just fit barber said hes a great professional 
broadcaster a wonderful interviewer and very sensitive he doesnt 
put his ego first 
barber prepares for his weekly show with the diligence he 
approached the thousands of baseball games he broadcast during the 
heyday of radio 
i dont want bob to trip me up said barber 
bob makes it easy barber teased he throws the big fat 
pitches to me 
the weekly segment is unrehearsed and live 
i have an idea of what i want to ask him said edwards 43 
i have no idea what kind of answers im going to get 
and edwards marvels at barbers wit 
on opening day baseball were doing a callin show and 
someone is on the line from washington relates edwards 
hello washington washington i guess theyre gone edwards 
said 
youre right bob barber said immediately they moved to 
minnesota in 61 
barber finds television sometimes too enamored with sports 
often at the expense of news 
he cited a weekend in early september when soviet prime minister 
gorbachev and president bush met in summit during the persian gulf 
crisis 
with all of this tremendous news television only had tennis 
and pro football barber said i want somebody to tell me what 
this means about our society 
barber follows the fortunes of protege vin scully and detroit 
tiger announcer ernie harwell who moved into a big league job when 
barber fell ill during the 1947 season 
two years later barber hired scully longtime voice of the 
dodgers right out of fordham university hes my boy barber 
said proudly 
barber who turned author naturalist and homemaker in 
retirement seldom travels anymore so he can spend time with his 
wife of 60 years lylah 
if i had a socalled career she made it possible because id 
be gone six months of the year he said she raised our 
daughter ran the house and was lonely 
daughter sarah a college professor lives in new york city 
barber is delighted he and lylah have enjoyed good health 
maintaining their onelevel brick home in a lush wooded 
tallahassee neighborhood 
she and i have a life to ourselves now said barber she 
had a very lonely existence it was a miserable existence 
barber who always disliked traveling said he loves his 
retirement routine 
i like being at home he said and the friday morning 
broadcast is something to look forward to

the elderly and prescription drugs can be a 
risky combination and signs of aging may really be adverse drug 
reactions according to a study 
if faulty prescribing is added to the catalog of drug abuse 
then the greatest epidemic of drug abuse in america is among our 
older people the study worst pills best pills concludes 
published two years ago by public citizen health research group 
an enterprise organized by consumer advocate ralph nader the book 
offers a guide to common prescription drugs gives advice on how to 
use them safely and recommends which drugs older people should 
avoid 
some doctors and patients assume that what are actually 
adverse drug reactions are simply signs of aging the study says 
as a result many serious adverse reactions are entirely 
overlooked or not recognized until they have caused serious harm 
the drugs responsible for the most serious adverse reactions in 
older adults are tranquilizers sleeping pills and other drugs 
intended to affect the mind high blood pressure drugs and drugs 
given for abnormal heart rhythms and drugs used to treat 
intestinal problems the study said 
more than 9 million adverse drug reactions occur each year in 
older americans with an estimated 243000 people 60 or over 
hospitalized for such reactions in 1985 the study said 
it said 32000 older adults suffer hip fractures each year 
attributable to druginduced falling and 163000 suffer from 
mental impairment either caused or worsened by drugs 
the study lists several reasons why older people are more prone 
to adverse drug reactions including lower weight a smaller amount 
of water and a larger proportion of fat than younger people 
therefore the amount of drug per pound of body weight or per 
pound of body water will often be much higher in an older adult 
than it would be if the same amount of the drug were given to a 
younger person it said 
and it said drugs that concentrate in fatty tissue may stay in 
the body longer simply because there is more fat 
other factors decreased ability of the liver to process drugs 
decreased ability of the kidneys to clear drugs out of the body and 
increased sensitivity to many drugs 
taking overthecounter drugs in addition to prescription drugs 
also boosts the odds of an adverse reaction it said 
the study asserts that up to twothirds of the prescriptions 
filled by older adults each year fall into three categories 
not needed because the problem is not one for which the drug 
is a proper solution 
needlessly dangerous because a less dangerous drug would give 
the same benefit 
the right drug but with a dose that is unnecessarily high 
causing extra risks without extra benefits 
the study contends a host of illnesses often attributed to old 
age actually can be drug induced 
its list includes depression hallucinations or psychoses 
involuntary twitches of the face arms or legs dizziness on 
standing loss of appetite nausea or vomiting abdominal pain 
bleeding or ulcers constipation diarrhea difficulty urinating or 
urinary incontinence 
the studys advice take an inventory of the drugs you or your 
elderly parents have taken over the last month put samples in a 
bag and take them to your doctor for analysis 
the study includes a list with detailed descriptions of 
possible side effects of 104 prescription drugs older adults 
should not use 
it also offers descriptions of 183 drugs it says are safer 
alternatives 
 
the study is available from public citizen at 12 a copy

the potato disease that caused europes great 
potato famine in the 19th century was killing potatoes in mexico in 
1947 and the man who has become mr potato went to seek a 
solution 
john niederhauser a plant pathologist who lives in tucson 
recently received the 200000 world food prize for helping develop 
a blightresistant potato 
the award recognizes the achievements of individuals who improve 
the worlds food system said founder norman borlaug a 1970 noble 
peace prize winner and niederhausers achievements have affected 
countries from mexico to bangladesh borlaug said 
although he spent the first eight years of his life in 
washington state on his familys farm niederhauser 73 said he 
first became interested in potatoes while a student at cornell 
university he said he used to select the best potatoes for farmers 
while working summers as a potato inspector for the new york state 
seed inspection service 
but it was not until he had gone to mexico that he earned his 
nickname when a former president of the rockefeller foundation 
george harrar introduced mr potato at a meeting niederhauser 
said its kind of hung around since then niederhauser said 
nowadays hes retired but his agenda remains full ive 
retired four times he said 
niederhauser said he began developing a blightresistant potato 
after accepting a position with the mexicorockefeller foundation 
agricultural program in 1947 
he said he thought twice about leaving his teaching position at 
cornell but i was attracted by the opportunity to work in a 
country in the undeveloped world and help them produce more basic 
food it was different but i felt we were doing something he 
said 
lateblight disease occurs when the lateblight fungus 
scientifically termed phythophthora incestans destroys the 
potatos foilage and eventually the potato itself niederhauser 
said 
the fungus originally is from mexico and is the main reason 
us farmers spray potatoes a practice farmers in developing 
countries cant afford he said 
the blightresistant potato was 15 years in the making 
niederhauser said mexico is the only place where blightresistant 
wild potatoes can grow and they were crossed with cultivated 
potatoes to form an edible blightresistant potato that didnt 
require spraying he said 
niederhauser was one of four foundation members who worked with 
the mexican government scientists and farmers they were paid by 
the foundation but worked as members of mexicos ministry of 
agriculture 
my interest in potatoes gradually increased as i saw problems 
we could help on together he said 
in mexico niederhauser and colleagues helped raise annual 
potato production from 134000 metric tons when they arrived to 
more than 1 million metric tons by 1982 
niederhausers impact however is not limited to mexico he has 
worked in bangladesh colombia india pakistan and turkey with 
scientists and farmers 
though he worked in mexico for 35 years and raised four children 
there with his wife he has traveled around the world 
i spent two years in the soviet union between high school and 
college and worked on farms there he said he studied at the 
agricultural academy in the soviet union in 193536 
he travels around the world recently he returned to mexico to 
help with an international potato project other interested 
countries include poland the netherlands and peru 
when hes not visiting other countries he gives seminars and 
assists with the biosphere ii project in oracle northeast of 
tucson

a company has produced four videos to help 
aging americans and those who care for them sort through the 
bewildering choices about insurance and health care 
jeanette vaughan studied health care in college but couldnt 
think of a way to market her research after seeing la law 
character arnold becker peddle a video of himself giving advice on 
divorce ms vaughn plunged in 
she made the videos all about aging and created ageview 
inc which distributes them the series sells for 195 and is 
marketed to hospitals nursing homes and health care agencies 
while the public can buy the series ms vaughan hopes agencies 
will buy it to show consumers for free 
by 2030 21 percent of amercans will be over 65 but ms vaughan 
said most of the country hasnt considered the idea of an older 
america 
the first ones feeling the impact are the women over 40 who 
are working and also trying to take care of aging parents said 
ms vaughan 28 
among the topics on the tapes are how to obtain medicare 
medicaid private insurance and home health care the psychosocial 
views of aging and how to relate to older relatives and details on 
nutrition safety and equipment use for elderly patients cared for 
at home 
delores moyer executive director of alverno health care corp 
based in memphis tenn is one of the agencies in 275 us cities 
that uses the tapes 
we plan to start broadcasting the tapes across our 
closedcircuit tv network in the hospitals so patients and families 
can view the tapes while they are in the waiting room said ms 
moyer whose company operates nine hospitals 
ms vaughan said she plans to develop additional tapes its 
not the answer to everything but it points people in the right 
direction she said

a garden abounds in fascinating lore 
each plant has a story some highly dramatic or amusing and 
getting to know them adds a satisfying dimension to gardening 
take arugula the salad green the name suggests a recent 
mediterranean arrival but digging in old books i found that under 
the name rocket it was a favorite of queen elizabeth i and came 
to america with the puritans 
at various times this herb was celebrated as a digestive aid a 
painkiller a deoderant a freckle remover a cough medicine a 
flavoring for preserved meats and like many other innocent 
edibles an aphrodisiac 
over the years ive put together a modest little shelf of 
histories containing such tidbits i found one of my best books by 
chance browsing in a bookstore i glimpsed the title of a thick 
paperback that was gathering dust near the floor it was 
sturtevants edible plants of the world 
this 685page volume dover publications inc new york turned 
out to be a gold mine on the origins of vegetables and their 
legends or superstitions bostonborn edward lewis sturtevant a 
19th century agriculturist touches on 2897 species with comments 
from 560 sources 
he tells astonishing tales like that of a group of ancient 
greek soldiers choosing slaughter in battle rather than escaping 
through a field of fava beans they believed evil 
some books may be out of print but you can get them at your 
library or through interlibrary loans with luck you may find some 
in secondhand bookstores to add to your collection 
the national geographic society steered me to a store that had 
one of the few remaining copies of the world in your garden 
published by the society in 1957 this is a superb volume 
containing instructive and entertaining essays on where our plants 
come from 
one writer in the book victor r boswell says he looked at a 
friends garden and told him to his surprise that the only truly 
american vegetables he was growing were tomatoes snap beans 
peppers limas and potatoes 
all the others in his garden were of foreign origin onions 
radishes lettuce spinach beets chard cabbage broccoli 
collards carrots parsley turnips peas asparagus soybeans 
mustard and eggplant 
what the colonists found in north america and what they brought 
with them is beautifully told in ann leightons early american 
gardens houghton mifflin co boston 1970 still available in 
paperback from the university of massachusetts press 
a captivating item in this book is the bill of sale listing the 
seeds john winthrop jr carried on a 1631 voyage to new england 
leightons book profiles the culinary and medical uses of 
individual plants in that era and contains rich quotations from 
herbalists of antiquity like the greeks galen and dioscorides and 
the roman pliny the elder and such early english writers as 
nicholas culpepper john evelyn john josselyn john gerard and 
john parkinson 
the secrets of the seed by barbara friedlander grossett and 
dunlap new york 1974 sparkles with references to quaint customs 
of the past such as a girl giving a turnip to a suitor to signify 
the cold shoulder and historical bits like an 1893 ruling of the 
us supreme court that the tomato was a dinner table vegetable 
rather than a fruit an importer who wanted to avoid paying duty 
argued it was a fruit which biologically it is 
a british writer alice m coats does a good job profiling 
flowers in flowers and their histories mcgrawhill book co 
1971 want to know about petunias coats tells us the first 
recorded petunia was p nyctaginiflora a white sweetscented 
nightblooming flower which was discovered in brazil in 1823 by a 
french commission it was named petunia because of its 
resemblence to the tobacco plant known to the natives as petun 
a book i like to browse in is harold mcgees on food and 
cooking charles scribners and sons new york 1984 mcgees 
684page volume ranges far and wide in history and science on

doctors are trying to find out why some older 
patients in hospitals get well physically but never seem to recover 
emotionally 
the illness gets better but the patient gets worse said 
robert m palmer a geriatrician at university hospitals of 
cleveland 
palmer and dr c seth landefeld recently received a 485000 
grant from the john a hartford foundation to study elderly 
patients affected by dysfunctional syndrome 
the doctors said some patients who are hospitalized can no 
longer perform simple tasks such as walking bathing and dressing 
when there seems to be no physical reason 
landefeld said up to 30 percent of patients over 75 lose some 
ability 
part of the grant was used to remodel a hospital unit to 
determine whether a change in atmosphere can reduce the incidence 
of the syndrome the 15bed unit which opened in july represents 
a departure in the way such patients are cared for the doctors 
said 
greater emphasis is placed on how well a patient is eating 
walking sleeping and using the bathroom and on signs of 
depression 
the doctors plan to compare how well patients do in the new unit 
with results from other hospital units

the national consumers union says the impact 
of increased medicare premiums and taxes will be offset by 
meaningful new protection for those buying supplemental medigap 
insurance 
since 1965 when medicare was established consumers have 
complained bitterly about sharp sales practices ripoff policies 
and skyrocketing rates said gail shearer a consumers union 
executive 
the medigap private insurance market was intended to help fill 
gaps in medicare health insurance coverage for the elderly but ms 
shearer said it has left consumers confused and overwhelmed 
they waste money on unnecessary coverage cannot tell a good 
policy from a bad one and often have no one to turn to except the 
insurance agent for advice she said 
the consumers union said the new curbs on medigap include 
requirements that companies package insurance benefits in 
similar fashion allowing older people to compare policies 
establishment of state and local counseling programs to help 
the elderly make the best insurance coverage decisions 
requirements that private insurance companies pay more in 
benefits companies had been encouraged to pay out 60 percent on 
premiums collected now they will be required to pay out 65 
percent

roger frankels golf game is deteriorating 
gerald munitz had hoped to take it easy and spend ore time with 
his wife and six children 
the economic downturn has breathed new life into what had been a 
shunned speciality bankruptcy law and frankel and munitz are 
part of the boom 
law schools report that more students are interested in learning 
about bankruptcy though some prefer to call it corporate 
restructuring 
certainly there is a feeling its a much more stable part of 
the profession right now said june thompson of harvard law 
schools career services office 
the newfound interest in bankruptcy law is due in part to a 
credit crunch among corporations and individuals that took part in 
the wheeling and dealing and spendnow paylater economics of the 
reagan era 
the administrative office of the us courts said the number of 
bankruptcy petitions filed annually nationwide has doubled in the 
past five years to more than 725000 corporate bankruptcies 
comprise less than 10 percent of the total 
most involve individuals seeking a way out from under a mountain 
of debt often caused by running up credit card charges 
frankel a bankruptcy lawyer for 20 years said i have never 
seen it like this in the nations capital 
his fiveday work week of the past is gone since last spring 
hes been on the job 10 hours to 12 hours a day six days a week 
my golf game is suffering seriously i have young kids id 
like to see grow up its difficult he said 
munitz said it is the same in the nations heartland his 
chicago practice is taking up more and more of his time just at 
the point in life when youre hoping to take things easier he 
said 
munitz 57 and a father of six children ranging in age from 11 
to 27 said he would like to see more of them and his wife than his 
work permits 
the sums of money also have changed since he started practicing 
as a young lawyer when someone owed a million dollars that was 
all the money in the world he said its peanuts these days 
were accustomed to dealing with a billion dollars in debt the 
numbers are mindboggling 
the competition for bankruptcy experts has law firms scrambling 
to hire them 
there are a lot more bankruptcy lawyers particularly among 
young people who five or eight year ago turned their nose up at 
this kind of thing said nathan feinstein a bankruptcy expert 
here 
feinstein who heads an american bar association committee on 
bankruptcy law said that in the early 1980s only a handful of the 
nations 200 largest law firms had a bankruptcy department 
today nearly all of them have teams of bankruptcy attorneys 
many have acquired bankruptcy boutiques small firms of perhaps 
a dozen or fewer lawyers who practice the specialty 
the demand has become so great that bankruptcy attorneys have 
been flooded with offers to switch firms feinstein said 
you start worrying if you havent been called by a headhunter 
this week he said 
job placement firms say the hunt for bankruptcy expertise is not 
limited to the traditional financial centers new york los angeles 
and chicago 
the nations capital for example is a sellers market for 
attorneys due only in part to the state of the local economy 
there have been a number of major bankruptcies in the 
washington dc area and a downturn in what once was considered 
a recessionproof real estate market 
the collapse of the national bank of washington alone has 
spawned a cottage industry for lawyers 
more than threedozen lawyers showed up in a federal courtroom 
here recently to handle a spate of cases arising from the banks 
demise 
all i know is the bank lost i lost and the lawyers won 
said luther m hodges former chairman of the banks parent 
company 
some businesses go belly up in bankruptcy and sell off their 
assets but in most bankruptcy proceedings the overextended 
borrower engages in what is called restructuring or reorganization 
creditors are paid a fraction of what they are owed as the debtor 
is placed under strict court scrutiny 
ironically bankruptcies do not necessarily jump when a 
recession hits the opposite may be true as lenders decide its a 
bad time to collect when the value of corporate assets is reduced

combining anemic puns with relevant 
statistics louis rukeyser grins and winks his way into the homes 
of 10 million television viewers every friday 
since 1970 rukeyser has demystified the jargon and gyrations of 
the economy his irreverant attitude toward the oftenstuffy 
subject has made his show wall street week one of the most 
popular half hours on public tv 
a 20th anniversary program with some of the shows best guests 
will air friday from the popular tavern on the green restaurant in 
new york a onehour retrospective will follow on next monday 
the rakish whitehaired rukeyser is one of the most durable 
television personalities on the air rivaling veteran luminaries 
such as mr rogers johnny carson and julia child 
he is known for painful fits of prose once while answering a 
viewers letter on investing in a hairpiece manufacturer rukeyser 
said if all your money seems to be hair today and gone tomorrow 
well try to make it grow by giving you the bald facts on how to 
get your investments toupee 
after a market slump he considered changing the name of the 
show to wall street wake he often consoles viewers by telling them 
to remember that its only their money not their life 
we have in america a bad tendency that things have to be 
either serious or fun he said before taping the show at 
maryland public television in suburban baltimore whereas in real 
life this isnt true the teachers we all remember in high school 
and college were not the ones who put us to sleep i dont think 
any of us should apologize for not being dull 
nobody wants to come home on a friday to be educated first 
you have to pull them into the tent 
along the way rukeyser was dubbed by people magazine as the 
only sex symbol of the dismal science of economics the new 
york daily news identified him as the economic guru of the 
industry 
outside of the wall street journal rukeyser has been a 
pioneer in demonstrating the popular appeal of quality business 
journalism said thomas rosenstiel a media cretic for the los 
angeles times he is especially good at proving that this stuff 
can be interesting and useful without being deadly dull 
rukeyser 57 appears each week with three panelists chosen 
from a pool of money managers and financial analysts who question 
the guest of the week such as the chairman of the securities and 
exchange commission or noted economist john kenneth galbraith 
in addition technical analysts whom he calls elves vote on a 
weekly elves index that assesses the strength or weakness of 
the economy 
rukeyser doesnt makes any predictions other than to say he is a 
longterm bull he constantly issues disclaimers on stock tips 
offered by guests of the show nonetheless their recommendations 
often cause share prices to rise sharply the week after the show 
airs 
ralph acampora head of prudentialbache securities technical 
analysis division and one of rukeysers elves credits him with 
starting business coverage on tv 
when i started with prudential i told them i wanted a big 
chart room and a television acampora said they asked me why i 
wanted a tv and i told them mrs obrien sitting at home has the 
greatest information in the world 
that mythical viewer is watching business news on cable news 
network and financial news network and its all because of lou 
acampora said 
rukeyser a former foreign correspondent for abc and the 
baltimore sun became the first economic commentator for a 
network in 1968 with abc he moonlighted on the pbs show for three 
years before leaving abc complaining about television coverage of 
economics 
he still maintains economics is the most poorly covered area of 
american journalism 
the prevailing view is that the subject of economics is too 
dull andor too complicated to hold an audience larger than the 
capacity of your average telephone booth he said i think 
thats nonsense i think there is a hunger in the american public 
for clear believable understandable usable pocketbook 
information 
despite his bullish outlook he concedes the economy is 
currently looking bleak but hes quick to remind anyone that he 
doesnt invest for shortterm profit 
punk anemic weak getting weaker the outlook for the next 
few months is soggy at best rukeyser said but even with 
minimal policy changes we can be on our way again by 1992 
rukeyser who also writes a syndicated newspaper column 
lectures and has written two books is known for being tough on his 
panelists and guests he continually pleads with them to speak in 
english 
jargon is a very convenient shield for people not entirely 
sure of what they are saying he said 
rukeyser says he will continue doing the show as long as it is 
fun which it still is and as long as his audience still wants 
him 
or as he might put it his stock may be maturing but his 
ratings are bullish and the dividends rewarding so rally round 
the tube in confidence the guru will keep your interest primed

groups but its power has shrunk along with the industry it 
represents this year 2978 sampl executives and their spouses 
league staff members journalists and others are expected to attend 
the convention down from 3862 in 1989 and 5500 in 1988 
the surviving thrift officials are left pondering how to regain 
even a portion of their former clout and their good name 
theyre lepers they know it and theyre unhappy about it 
said financial institution analyst bert ely of alexandria va 
president reagan visited the convention in 1982 george bush did 
the same in 1985 as vice president in other years the convention 
attracted at the very least a cabinet secretary or congressional 
committee chairman 
this year not one member of congress is scheduled to appear 
at least three house incumbents with ties to the sampl industry 
were unseated last week rep john hiler rind accused by his 
opponent of having a prosampl voting record rep charles pashayan 
rcalif who interceded with regulators on behalf of lincoln 
savings and loan owner charles keating and rep denny smith 
rore who sat on the board of a local sampl 
convention headliners this year are housing and urban 
development undersecretary alfred dellibovi and two treasury 
department officials office of thrift supervision director 
timothy ryan and comptroller of the currency robert clarke a bank 
regulator 
the leagues record of success in washington has been mixed this 
year it successfully persuaded the office of thrift supervision to 
relax limits on the dividends struggling but solvent thrifts may 
pay stockholders and to increase the size of the loans healthy 
thrifts may make to one borrower 
but its drive to get congress to dilute rules forcing the 
industry to concentrate 70 percent of its assets on housing went 
nowhere 
the league also hasnt persuaded the thrift office to allow its 
members to convert to state savings banks which operate with fewer 
restrictions on their lending 
next year one of the groups goals will be to prevent congress 
from saddling it with more of the sampl bailout cost another is to 
keep federal deposit insurance from being dramatically scaled back

once the persian gulf crisis is over the world 
will find itself flooded with oil as nations start arguing over how 
much crude each should pump experts believe 
opec nations that stepped up production to offset the loss of 
iraqi and kuwaiti crude will be caught in a double whammy as prices 
come crashing down and the previously boycotted oil pushes its way 
into the market the producers will have a tough time trying to 
agree on who should cut back and by how much analysts say 
thats inevitable and it may be very difficult for them to 
do because when the crisis ends the 11 opec countries other than 
iraq and kuwait will already be producing more oil than the world 
needs from all of opec said philip dodge an oil analyst with 
nomura securities international inc 
after iraq invaded kuwait in early august the international 
embargo of their oil created a shortfall of about 4 million barrels 
of crude a day 
saudi arabia and venezuela immediately began pushing for higher 
production levels to erase the deficit opec oil ministers 
eventually agreed to temporarily lift the cartels quotas 
within weeks the combination of more oil and less demand had 
virtually erased the shortfall 
saudi arabia the worlds biggest exporter says it plans to 
keep pumping more 
since the crisis began saudi production has gone up about 57 
percent from around 52 million barrels a day to around 82 
million barrels a day the saudis hope to bring production to 85 
million barrels a day in the near future and they want to raise 
capacity to a potential level of 10 million barrels a day within 
the next two years 
it remains unclear whether a war in the gulf would damage any 
middle east production facilities or how long it would take to 
repair any damage the iraniraq war showed it is hard to stop the 
flow of oil through repeated bombings although experts agree that 
iraqi troops might be able to cause greater damage to kuwaiti 
facilities by blowing them up with explosives placed right at the 
wellhead 
regardless of any damage or its longevity the oil markets will 
eventually feel the glut as iraqi and kuwaiti crude gets back in 
once that happens the nations that increased their production 
during the crisis will probably be reluctant to cut back 
particularly since their oil will bring far less money per barrel 
all the opec producers are going to be at higher levels than 
they were before the invasion said annlouise hittle a senior 
oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc other members are 
probably going to be reluctant to cut back on production theyll 
have to adjust the quotas and whos going to be able to produce 
what and that sort of thing 
it wont be easy and some in the industry believe the strains 
on the organization of petroleum exporting countries will be great 
dodge said he thinks venezuela might even weaken its ties to the 
arab oil producers and try to align itself more closely with 
consuming nations 
i would say for all intents and purposes venezuelas out of 
opec dodge said thats partly because the arab members of 
opec were cheating on them so much i think venezuela was the most 
wellbehaved of all the opec countries 
there have already been some small oversupply problems as saudi 
arabia and iran have had trouble selling all the oil they are 
pumping because buyers are not interested in getting the entire 
stock of certain lessdesirable grades 
the same thing happened when the bush administration decided to 
sell 5 million barrels from the us strategic petroleum reserve in 
an effort to bring down spiraling prices some 800000 barrels of 
an inferior grade did not have a single bidder but the warinduced 
high price of oil did not budge on such evidence of strong supply

the new owners of argentinas 
dilapidated telephone system face a huge task as they try to reform 
a business that has been run down during 42 years of state 
ownership 
the empresa nacional de telecomunicaciones was once one of the 
best systems on the continent but it is now in a state of 
disarray 
when it rains lines go dead on sunny days calls dialed 
correctly often ring the wrong number or get crossed so that 
several voices are heard fax and computer tramsmissions break off 
because of the weak quality of the lines 
as many as 500000 lines one of every seven may be out of 
service at any moment repairs can take months 
regional circuits are so crowded that during the business day it 
is difficult to call the provinces from the capital telephone 
books are years out of date except for those in the capital 
services like call forwarding and speed dialing dont exist 
there is a lot to do said jan jacques damlamian the 
industrial director of france telecom which owns france cables and 
radio and has become a partial owner of the argentine system known 
as entel 
on thursday a group of investors led by the spanish phone 
company telefonica and new yorkbased citibank bought a 60 percent 
share of entels southern half a system of 15 million lines that 
stretch from buenos aires west to the andes and south through 
patagonia to tierra del fuego 
another group led by the italian and french phone companies stet 
and cables and radio respectively and new yorkbased jp morgan 
bank bought entels northern half 16 million lines from buenos 
aires west to chile and north to bolivia paraguay brazil and 
uruguay 
the privatization with a value of about 134 billion is one 
of the largest in latin american history 
despite the sorry state of the system the new owners are 
confident they can turn things around and start turning a profit 
one way to achieve savings will probably be cuts in the entel 
staff of 43000 about one person for every 72 lines telefonica 
manages to get by with one worker for every 186 lines 
were not the little sisters of the poor were here to make 
money telefonica president candido velasquez told the newspaper 
la nacion 
rates were raised drastically in the months leading up to the 
sale they will be kept high so will installation charges a new 
phone line for a business may cost 2500 telefonica directors 
said at a news conference 
good service costs more than bad service velasquez said 
in the past entel employees paid reduced rates for their 
phones 
in principle im against that telefonicas director of 
international business luis martin de bustamante said 
costs will also be brought down by modernizing outdated 
equipment tens of thousands of lines that are out of service will 
be repaired so they can be brought back online and hundreds of 
thousands of new lines will be installed 
also the new owners will try to bolster business by getting 
several hundred thousand people off of the lengthy waiting lists 
for new phones the penetration level of one phone for every 11 
argentines is relatively low by the standards of developed 
countries 
the new owners stress that change wont come overnight

american telephone and telegraph co 
and japans nec corp have won a multimillion dollar contract to 
install 700000 new digital telephone lines on java bali sulawesi 
and sumatra a spokesman of the stateowned telecommunications 
company said monday 
muhammad gempita said the government has chosen the american and 
japanese companies over three other bidders 
the three other companies were fujitsu ltd of japan ericson 
australia pty of australia and alcatel nv of the netherlands 
the government last february put off awarding a contract for a 
300 million telecommunications project as none of the bidders 
fully met its requirements with regard to funding and price 
atampt and nec had been the last companies in the contest until 
the governments decision for a retendering 
the announcement came after reports that the us and the 
japanese governments were pressing the indonesian government to 
give the contract to bidders from their countries 
the spokesman did not give many details on the contracts won by 
the two bidders but informed sources said the scope of the digital 
telephone project has been changed extensively from its original 
plan 
the retendered contract originally called for the supply of only 
350000 line units for a price of 300 million 
the scope of work now seemed to have been enlarged and the two 
winners will now each supply 350000 lines of which 200000 lines 
will be imported and the other 150000 lines will be made locally 
in a joint venture with a local company 
the value of the contract is still to be negotiated the 
spokesman said 
the president director of the stateowned telecommunications 
company cacu sudarijanto said the contracts will be signed with 
both companies in january and they will be expected to complete 
work in three years

the largest labor union at general 
dynamics narrowly rejected the companys offer for a new threeyear 
contract sunday but did not vote to strike 
company officials and the 10000member international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers agreed to a 
oneweek extension of their current contract 
the existing agreement which covers an estimated 10000 
production and maintenance workers at gds fort worth division 
would have expired at 1159 pm sunday 
with just hours to spare union members voted 3898 to 3700 to 
reject the companys final offer during a tense meeting at the 
tarrant county convention center 
instead of calling for a vote to strike union leaders 
recommended extending the deadline to midnight nov 18 the 
extension was approved by a 5to1 majority 
union president pat lane said the iam asked for the extra time 
because gd obtained a temporary restraining order friday that would 
prohibit union members from picketing the companys fort worth 
plant during rush hours when lines of cars are trying to get in and 
out of the plant 
union attorney rod tanner said he plans to file a motion today 
to dissolve the restraining order 
three main issues apparently separates the two sides wage 
increases and bonuses gds proposal that workers pay a portion of 
health care premiums and the companys practice of sending work 
outside the plant to other suppliers 
gds best and final offer provided for general wage increases of 
55 percent the first year and 3 percent the following two years of 
the contract the company also offered a 1000 bonus payable nov 
30 if union members ratified the contract 
both sides clearly would like to avoid a strike with union 
members facing an uncertain economy and gd pressed to meet air 
force production schedules for its f16 fighting falcon jet 
both sides still carry bitter memories of a 17day strike in 
1984 that led to an outbreak of violence at picket lines outside 
the plants main gate

a toughened clean air act and the threat to oil 
supplies poised by the persian gulf crisis are among the challenges 
to be addressed by oil industry experts attending the american 
petroleum institutes annual meeting here 
about 1200 industry executives and analysts are expected at the 
threeday meeting that ends tuesday 
the passage in october of the new clean air act prompted the 
petroleum and auto industries to conduct a joint effort to develop 
a new gasoline to meet the stricter standards for gasoline 
emissions 
industry officials say the act has mandated a product for which 
manufacturing technology does not exist and may not exist when the 
cleaner gasoline is required to be on the market 
the clean air act requires a 15 percent reduction in gas 
emissions by 1995 and 25 percent by 2000 
because of the new standards other fuels such as ethanol 
may become more desirable but low oil prices in the 1980s helped 
weaken the effort to develop alternative fuels 
raymond g friend vice president of high plains corp of 
wichita kan which produces ethanol says ethanols reputation as 
damaging to autos is false and has been challenged in a federal 
lawsuit against nine oil companies 
the antiethanol campaign has diminished and demand is 
building he said 
a number of oil companies among them amoco and texaco have 
introduced reformulated lesspolluting gasolines 
the crisis in the persian gulf has increased the relationship 
between supply and environmental issues the crisis has increased 
oil industry interest in environmentally sensitive areas of the 
united states now closed to drilling as possible new sources of 
oil they include the outer continental shelf federal lands in the 
lower 48 states and the arctic wildlife refuge in alaska 
but charles j dibona president of the petroleum institute 
acknowledges that a lack of public trust stemming from the exxon 
valdez oil spill in march 1989 reduces oil industry options 
there is not a lot of recognition that we ought to address the 
question of access to public lands for oil exploration dibona 
said recently this persian gulf crisis has not caused people 
to reassess opening the arctic refuge or offshore drilling 
dibona says domestic exploration is an answer to us dependence 
on foreign oil supplies the number of drilling rigs in the united 
states has increased to 1100 from about 900 since iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
but new drilling will be fighting the recent downward trend in 
us oil production from 37 billion gallons in 1985 to 33 billion 
gallons in 1989 
there is a real need to rethink the domestic exploration 
strategy said james m patterson professor of marketing at 
indiana university in bloomington about 80 percent of the holes 
ever drilled are in the lower 48 states so there are probably no 
great surprises here 
patterson says oil companies must pursue oil in other areas 
outside the middle east if exploration is not allowed in the arctic 
refuges he said mexico despite its long history of opposition to 
us participation in its oil industry may be willing to change 
venezuela canada romania and the soviet union may also present 
opportunities patterson said 
dibona said the institute faces several legislative issues 
including its continuing effort to open the arctic national 
wildlife refuge to drilling 
he said the industry is concerned about congressional 
consideration of a resource conservation and recovery act that 
would regulate underground reinjection and storage and statelevel 
attempts to prevent large petroleum companies from operating their 
own gasoline stations

two station wagons and two twodoor hatchbacks

plant expansion 
the dealership official who requested anonymity told the 
publication saturn officials said they wanted to give us a 
minivan and a small pickup but they said they couldnt do that 
before 1996 because theyd need to build another plant 
he also said a minivan is on the drawing board

240000 vehicles annually the automotive news said production 
there was scheduled to reach 303000 by the 1993 model year and 
360000 the following model year 
that likely would force saturn to build a second plant or expand

usx corp and the united steelworkers union 
have recessed talks without reaching an early contract settlement 
usw chief negotiator andrew lefty palm said sunday the 
companys proposal fell short on wages on costofliving hikes for 
retirees and on job security in the event usx sells its steel 
division as some analysts predict 
the company is obviously disappointed that no agreement was 
reached but i remain optimistic that a competitive agreement in 
the interests of all concerned parties will be reached before the 
feb 1 expiration date said thomas w sterling vice president 
of employee relations for usxs steel division 
bargainers started talks oct 15 on a new contract for 18000 
usw members in pennsylvania ohio indiana illinois alabama 
minnesota and california 
although the fouryear contract runs for 10 more weeks the 
company and union had imposed a settlement deadline of nov 10 the 
two sides met for four hours saturday in coraopolis pa before 
deciding to recess no date was set for talks to resume 
this union tried very hard to get an early agreement palm 
said at a news conference 
palm said the company proposal would have restored wages to the 
1982 level but did not provide for further increases steelworkers 
have made wage concessions to usx for the past eight years 
complicating the negotiations was usxs recent announcement that 
it plans to make its steel division a separate subsidiary 
prompting some analysts to predict the division will be sold 
the union wants a contract that restores 130 an hour in 
concessions plus offers compensation for the past 18 months when 
usx steelworkers were paid less than their counterparts at other 
domestic steel makers 
palm said the companys offer was less generous than terms 
accepted by usw members at ltv steel inc bethlehem steel inc 
national steel inc armco inc and inland steel inc 
the current contract was reached after a sixmonth work stoppage 
in 1986

trans world airlines inc wants to buy pan am 
corp but only if pan ams deal to sell important routes to london 
falls through twa chairman carl icahn said 
icahn has proposed offering about 150 million in cash and 
securities with a face value of 300 million for the struggling 
carrier 
although twa is considered to be in better health than pan am 
both have been hurt by rising fuel prices since the iraqi invasion 
and fewer passengers since the economy started weakening 
in a telephone interview late sunday icahn said pan am chairman 
thomas plaskett had asked him to make an offer in case pan ams 
talks with united airlines parent ual corp fall through 
as part of a 400 million deal pan am has agreed to sell key 
routes between new york and london to ual 
icahn who sent his proposal in a letter to plaskett friday 
said his proposal would only be valid if the pan amual route deal 
was terminated the letter emphasizes that twa does not want to 
disturb the arrangement with united according to a source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
if twa buys pan am duplicated routes like those to londons 
heathrow airport would be sold pan am said 
icahns letter which was dated and delivered late friday 
proposed pan am shareholders receive 1 per share in cash and 
securities with a face value of 2 per share the securities 
either preferred stock or promissory notes could bring different 
market prices 
pan ams stock was up 12 cents at 175 early today on the new 
york stock exchange 
pan am said in a statement it was still working to complete the 
route sale to united but that the deal could be called off if it 
is not completed by nov 14 
joe hopkins a spokesman for united would not comment on the 
twa proposal icahns letter also proposed buying the pan am 
shuttle which flies between boston new york and washington by 
the end of the year twas proposal to buy the rest of the company 
is open through nov 16 and twa would plan on completing the deal 
by the end of march 
the wall street journal reported recently that pan ams pilots 
might be willing to pay 150 million to 200 million for the 
shuttle alone subtracting other elements of pan ams deal with 
united the london routes are valued at about 290 million 
twa and pan am are the only two us airlines flying into 
londons heathrow airport other duplications are between the us 
and paris and the us and rome 
pan am last week announced that if it completed the route sale 
to united it would turn much of its attention to latin america and 
bolster its miami operations 
rising fuel prices since iraqs invasion of kuwait has hurt many 
airlines 
twa last month announced 430 layoffs from its workforce of 
33000 to cope with the rising jet fuel prices and the economic 
downturn 
twa also said it would stop hiring and training new pilots and 
flight attendants 
twa headquartered in mt kisco ny earned 1034 million in 
the second quarter of the year but that included onetime gains 
from the sales of assets totalling 1602 million in the second 
quarter of 1989 the airline lost 44 million 
earlier this month pan am announced it had lost 291 million 
or 19 cents per share for the third quarter in the same period a 
year earlier the airline lost 18 million or 12 cents a share 
the airline cited rising jet fuel costs for the poor 
performance

oklahoma led a list of several major oil 
producing states reporting declines in the number of working oil 
and gas rigs this past week a new survey said monday 
the overall total of working rigs in the united states dropped 
by 20 to 1124 from the previous week baker hughes inc reported 
the decrease attributed partly to bad weather followed several 
weeks of increases that had taken the total to its highest level 
since dec 28 1987 the count a year ago was 1045 the 
houstonbased toolmaker said last week the count improved by 37 
to 1144 
part of that decline good part of it was the weather said 
ike kerridge a vice president at baker hughes oklahoma lost 16 
rigs and we identified 11 of those that cannot move because of wet 
ground oklahoma had about four inches of rain last week 
kerridge said some of the losses were offset by a good 
increase in the offshore drilling rigs 
of the total rigs running as of monday 109 were offshore 26 
were in inland waters and 989 were on land the toolmaker reported 
baker hughes has kept track of the rig count a widely watched 
index of drilling activity since 1940 the count represents the 
number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
besides oklahoma other major oil producing states reporting rig 
losses for the week include pennsylvania which dropped by eight 
wyoming down by five california and colorado which each lost 
two and kansas new mexico and ohio which each lost one 
among states reporting gains for the week are louisiana which 
added eight texas up by three and michigan and north dakota 
which each increased its count by one rig

commerciallysponsored news program for teens in the classroom 
aft president albert shanker quit the board contending a breach 
of trust with knoxvillebased whittle and its channel one 
television news program that is beamed to schools across the 
country 
when i agreed to serve on the channel one council of advisers 
i made it clear in writing that my decision in no way constituted 
an endorsement either of the program or of advertising in the 
public schools shanker wrote whittle chairman chris whittle 
in fact i explicitly stated my role would be that of a watch 
dog he wrote in the oct 12 letter 
i should have realized that being on the council would 
inevitably lead to the perception that i endorsed channel one he 
wrote but it was not until i saw my name and picture being used 
in channel one promotional materials that this point was driven 
home 
shanker said his resignation was effective immediately and asked 
whittle to stop using his name and picture in promotional 
materials 
the aft is formally opposed to tv commercials in the classroom 
and denounces the lack of funding that compels schools to accept 
commercials in return for tv equipment such as whittle offers with 
channel one 
schools that sign up to show the channel one news show to their 
students are loaned satellite dishes and television monitors for 
every classroom they get to keep the equipmnet only as long as 
they show the 12minutes news show with its ads every school day 
whittle spokesman tom ingram said chris whittle and shanker had 
talked about the resignation 
he was not able to attend any of the meetings and the reason 
he joined was to have input ingram said being unable to 
attend he was unable to have input 
as for the promotion ingram said we are going to go ahead 
and continue to use the material and he understands

its 549 percent stake in the gold mining concern 
under terms of the stock swap bhp will continue to own 23 
percent of the new company which will be australias largest pure 
gold producer 
bhp said in a statement monday that the new company would be 
among the top 15 gold companies in the world with anticipated 1991 
production of about 750000 ounces 
bhp has undertaken a broad program of due dilligence covering 
all major technical legal and financial matters and is satisfied 
that the merger will provide the opportunity to strengthen its 
current investment in the australian gold industry bhp said 
newmont launched the bid in september after taking court action 
against a similar bid launched on it by robert champion de 
crespignys poseidon group 
poseidon later abandoned its bid for newmont but retains a 199 
percent stake in the company which would be equivalent to about 12 
percent of a merged newmontbhp gold group

several competitors are trying to break intel 
corps lucrative monopoly over a microprocessor that increasingly 
is the chip of choice for ibm personal computers and compatible 
models 
intels 80386 microprocessor has been a runaway success 
bringing in about a billion dollars a year in revenue and some of 
the highest profit margins the semiconductor industry has ever 
seen said michael slater editor of the newsletter microprocessor 
report 
microprocessors are fingernailsized wafers of silicon 
containing circuitry that acts as the brains of personal computers 
one of the wouldbe interlopers advanced micro devices inc 
began giving private demonstrations monday of its 386 clone at the 
huge comdex computer show here amd removed intels chips from 
several personal computers and replaced them with its own version 
there are no compatibility problems with it it works said 
amd spokesman david frink he said about 20 computer makers are 
testing the chip or have already evaluated it 
a public announcement of the amd microprocessor awaits a 
determination of its price and availability date officials of the 
semiconductor company said 
amd says it used a process called reverse engineering to devise 
a chip that mimics the 386 but uses different circuitry in fact 
amd says its chip is better because it uses less power 
several other semiconductor companies also are working on 386 
clones industry analysts say 
but intel one of the worlds largest semiconductor companies 
is not sitting still while competitors try to chip away at its 
blockbuster product it is involved in a thicket of legal conflicts 
with amd with which it once enjoyed a cooperative relationship 
intel has filed two lawsuits one contending amd has no right to 
a crucial component of the 386 chip called microcode and the 
second charging that amd would infringe on intels trademark if it 
uses the 386 name to market its chip 
on friday a federal judge denied intels request for an 
injunction to block amd from using the 386 name but it was unclear 
whether the ruling would give computer makers who use the amd chip 
the right to call them 386 machines 
the microcode suit stems from a 1976 agreement in which intel 
granted amd the right to the patents and microcode for intel 
microprocessors intel now claims amd may only copy the microcode 
for its own use not to sell chips containing it 
microcode is a set of software instructions contained in a 
memory device on each microprocessor it tells the circuits how to 
process data 
amd based in sunnyvale calif will devise microcode of its 
own to mimic intels if it loses the suit frink said 
amd also is involved in another legal battle with intel that 
could result in amd gaining rights to make a carbon copy of the 386 
chip that dispute now in abritration stems from a 1982 
technologysharing agreement between the two companies 
intel claims amd reneged on the agreement amd says it met the 
terms of the pact and should be given access to the 386 chip as 
well as 500 million in damages 
an arbitrator ruled last month that intel did not act in good 
faith in the dispute but he delayed deciding whether amd should 
gain rights to the 386 chip until another phase of the proceeding 
which is scheduled to start this week 
the lawyers are really doing well over intel and amd said 
slater the newsletter editor 
intels 386 chip introduced in 1985 is becoming the favored 
microprocessor for international business machines corp personal 
computers and clones it is faster than the 286 chip it succeeded 
but not as costly as intels topoftheline 486 
four companies including amd make clones of the 286 chip under 
license from intel said intel spokeswoman pam pollace from the 
companys santa clara calif headquarters 
but no such licenses are planned for the 386 chip despite the 
fact that intel has been rationing its production to customers 
pollace said she said intel expects to meet demand by years end 
dataquest a hightech research firm says 73 million personal 
computers with the 386 chip and its lowercost variant the 386sx 
will be shipped this year 
dataquest projects that shipments of 386based machines will 
grow at a doubledigit pace over the next four years while those 
of computers with the 286 will decline about 7 percent

should we believe the government when it says 
the budget has been cut or the economy is still expanding 
privatesector economists business people and others are 
increasingly skeptical of government jargon and statistics 
most recently their eyebrows were raised by the governments 
figures for the thirdquarter gross national product which showed 
growth running at an annual rate of 18 percent confounding a vast 
number of researchers who were convinced the report should have 
shown the economy shrinking 
walter j williams of american business econometrics a 
ridgewood nj advisory firm that counts bluechip corporations 
as clients declared flatly that the supposed expansion will be 
revealed eventually as a contraction 
williams estimates that in reality the decline amounted to about 
2 percent on an annual basis and he expressed the personal opinion 
that the numbers were manipulated to influence the november 
elections 
economist e erich heinemann was equally blunt declaring the 
report of accelerated economic growth spurious and phony as a 
threedollar bill referring to underlying assumptions he said 
the illogic is dazzling 
such comments are becoming widespread and involve not just the 
accuracy of numbers but the intent of words as well economists and 
business people for example are upset that americans believe 
congress actually cut the budget 
among those angered by that interpretation are members of the 
us business and industrial council made up of the heads of 
mainly small and mediumsized businesses many of whom have had to 
cut their own budgets 
the council a conservative group based in washington issued a 
statement saying our member companies are increasingly frsutrated 
by the jargon of deficit reduction 
the statement explained they cannot fathom the current 
services approach to budgeting which allows for automatic 
increases in spending the reduction it says allows for 
240 billion in new spending 
it is the statistical communications however that seem to 
receive the most criticism and williams asserts that some of the 
distrust arises from the suspicions that economic numbers are 
managed 
for the past four years williams has questioned members of the 
national association of business economists on the credibility of 
economic numbers which in recent years have become more 
prominently displayed in the media 
the chief complaint that his fellow economists have he said is 
that government agencies that produce statistics lack adequate 
funding and staff but fears of manipulation especially in 
election years are growing he ssaid 
his survey in 1987 showed 15 percent of economistrespondents 
thought the staticstic were doctored in 1988 an election year 
the percentage rose to 33 dropped back to 15 in 1988 and soared to 
39 in 1990 another election year 
williams said his surveys are blind meaning respondents do 
not sign but in the most recent survey held in washington in 
september williams said several government economists spoke to him 
about their own doubts 
the report of higher gross national product in the third quarter 
was especially bewildering since many economists had forecast in 
advance that it would fall unconvinced they now look for downward 
revisions 
heinemann observes that the alleged pickup in gnp depended on an 
assumption that inflation slowed last summer but that anyone who 
has gone to a supermarket or a gas station in the last few months 
knows that is not true 
he points to inconsistencies industrial output was said to have 
risen but other statistics fail to coincide what happened to 
the goods did somebody buy them did they go into inventory were 
they exported 
he said the way the government tells the story the answer is 
none of the above but he added clearly these figures cannot 
all be correct

a public inquiry into the piper alpha oil rig 
disaster accused occidental petroleum ltd of unsafe practices in 
the july 1988 explosion that killed 167 men 
the inquiry published monday also recommended that 
responsibility for oil platform safety be transferred from 
britains department of energy to the health and safety executive 
the report recommends a thorough overhaul of existing safety 
practices regarding oil rigs and a tough new regime for oil and gas 
companies that own and operate the rigs 
energy secretary john wakeham said he passed the inquirys 
report on to scotlands senior law officer to determine whether 
occidental the piper alpha operator should be prosecuted 
the piper alpha disaster was the worlds worst oil rig 
explosion the platform burst into flames when gas from ruptured 
pipelines caught fire and the emergency systems on the rig failed 
to operate 
the smoke and flames were so intense that rescuing the men on 
the rig by helicopter or lifeboat was impossible the 62 survivors 
reached the sea by rope and hoses and by jumping off the platform 
at no stage was there a systematic attempt to lead men to 
escape the report said 
the report was written by scottish high court judge lord cullen 
who conducted the yearlong inquiry into the disaster 
the government is now acting to implement the recommendation 
for a new regulatory system and to ensure that the lessons of this 
terrible event are fully learnt and fully put into effect 
wakeham said 
cullen said the inquiry found a number of areas in which the 
laiddown procedure was not adhered to and unsafe practices were 
followed he also said occidental was too easily satisfied 
the platform systems were operating correctly the night of the 
disaster 
he criticized occidental for failing to provide proper emergency 
training for its staff and not paying sufficient attention to the 
threat of a major hazard 
he said the energy department conducted inspections on piper 
alpha that were superficial to the point of being of little use 
as a test of safety 
glenn shurtz president of the occidental petroleum corp unit 
rejected cullens criticisms but pledged to do anything to make 
the north sea a safer place to work 
lord cullens report and the profound changes it will bring to 
the whole oil industry will ensure that these men did not lose 
their lives in vain shurtz said 
occidental said it already has implemented many of cullens 
recommendations after studying the evidence at the inquiry 
the uk offshore operators association which represents 36 gas 
and oil companies working in the north sea welcomed the report as 
a blueprint for the future 
director harold hughes said the companies already have spent 
15 billion on improving safety 
he also said giving the health and safety executive 
responsibility for offshore safety would provide a strong 
independent framework to reassure people of oil rig safety 
under the recommendations the health and safety executive would 
have the power to close down rigs if they do not meet new safety 
standards

microsoft corp chairman bill gates today 
outlined his vision of the futuire of personal computers in which 
the desktop machines will provide access to almost unlimited 
information 
in the keynote address at the giant comdex computer show gates 
described a future in which computers are vastly more useful and 
easier to use 
gates whose company developed the most widely used operating 
system for personal computers outlined new technology that will 
bring video voice and handwriting recognition capability to 
personal computers 
this is a formidable challenge no single company is going to 
be able to do this he said 
gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and 
software companies to bring about his vision which he calls 
information at your fingertips 
in an amusing series of videos on a giant screen gates depicted 
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in a 
mythical town of twin points a spoof of the tv series twin 
peaks 
he showed how a deliveryman used a handheld computer that 
recognized handwriting to enter orders how students at a school 
could use a computer much like an encyclopedia today and how a 
couple building a house could walk through their a 
threedimensional model of their proposed home on a computer 
screen 
gates said these new technologies are not some science fiction 
dream but are all under development or are already in use 
gates speech kicked off a weeklong comdex show that promoters 
say attracted about 120000 computer retailers distributors and 
other industry people

the collapse of weekend talks on farm subsidies 
jeopardizes next months meeting to conclude ambitious accords for 
liberalizing trade a top trade official warned monday 
arthur dunkel directorgeneral of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade told an emergency meeting of senior trade 
negotiators that major political hurdles remained the emergency 
meeting was convened after talks on cutting farm subisidies broke 
up in disarray 
dunkel called for basic changes in present positions in the 
next hours or at most the next days 
it is not an exagggeration to say that the brussels meeting is 
now in jeopardy he told a special session of gatts trade 
negotiations committee which is overseeing the uruguay round of 
trade talks 
the talks launched in 1986 are meant to end by dec 7 with 
farreaching agreements to reduce barriers to trade in 15 sectors 
hopes of progress in agriculture the linchpin in the entire 
talks were dashed saturday when the united states and a group of 
farm exporting nations rejected a european community proposal on 
cuts in farm supports they also said offers from japan and south 
korea were inadequate 
the ec hasnt yet demonstrated to others that it has the 
flexibility to negotiate a package deputy us trade 
representative rufus yerxa said in a telephone interview 
yerxa called for significant movement in key areas 
including export subsidies 
the 12nation trading bloc submitted its proposal only last 
thursday after a months internal wrangling it offers an overall 
30 percent cut in farm supports but does not give commitments in 
specific areas the cuts over 10 years would be backdated to 1986 
thus giving the ec credit for measures already taken 
an ec official who requested anonymity described the offer as 
substantial he urged washington to adopt a more realistic 
approach to cuts in farm support 
the united states and the 14nation cairns group of farm 
exporters have proposed reductions of 75 percent in internal 
supports and import barriers they want export subsidies to be 
slashed by 90 percent as these are considered the most trade 
distorting the reforms would take place over 10 years using 1991 
as baseyear 
japans offer also provides for a 30 percent cut in farm 
supports but makes no provision for reducing import barriers in 
particular tokyo has showed no sign of relaxing its ban on rice 
imports 
south korea another big food importer has similarly said it is 
ready to negotiate reductions of up to 30 percent in farm supports 
while defending its restrictions on rice imports 
the trade source said no date was set for the resumption of 
talks on agriculture as progress was now dependent on new 
instructions from capitals the source spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the ball is in the communitys court yerxa said 
the deadlock in the uruguay round is expected to be high on the 
agenda when us president george bush meets ec commission 
president jacques delors and italian prime minister giulio 
andreotti in washington on tuesday 
also tuesday thousands of european farmers are expected to 
assemble with their livstock at gatts geneva headquarters to 
protest at what they see as attempts to cut their living standards

the midwest is thinking about earthquakes 
survival kits are popping up on store shelves and companies are 
hawking everything from antishatter window film to portable 
chemical toilets 
its incredible the response were getting said henry 
lawson vice president of cepp corp of los angeles the nations 
largest emergency preparedness firm were shipping thousands of 
kits were getting lots of orders 
the sudden upswing in business stems from a projection by new 
mexico climatologist iben browning he says theres a 50 percent 
chance of a major earthquake occurring dec 3 on the new madrid 
fault 
the fault zone runs from marked tree ark north to cairo 
ill and touches portions of missouri arkansas tennessee 
illinois and kentucky 
on thursday night a minor earthquake near new madrid mo 
shook some homes and heightened worry the tremor was felt in at 
least three states but there were no reports of damage or 
injuries 
brownings projection has been roundly criticized by earthquake 
experts and geologists as nothing more than a random guess but 
that hasnt prevented schools businesses and residents from 
preparing for the big one 
and companies that specialize in earthquake preparedness are 
getting ready for a big surge in business this week because they 
expect a twopart nbc miniseries about an temblor in los angeles 
will stir up more concern scientists and emergency officials have 
criticized that series which ends tonight for exaggerating the 
death and devastation a big quake would cause 
cepp corp is one of at least a dozen companies or groups 
selling various emergency kits that range in cost from 15 to 150 
and include such items as thermal blankets pouches of water and 
food guaranteed to last five years flashlights and firstaid 
supplies 
another california company the emergency lifeline of santa ana 
is conducting 16 emergency preparedness seminars in the region at 
50 a person and has mailed 10000 catalogs to schools and 
businesses here

im sure all of the companies in the emergency preparedness 
business have their eyes on the midwest said kathy gannon a 
native missourian who founded the santa ana company five years ago 
theres already getting to be a glut of kits on the market 
these products are familiar to californians rattled by many 
quakes over the years the emergency preparedness industry has been 
growing quickly there since the mid1980s but the midwest is 
really the first new market 
gannon and lawson said they expect that whats happening in the 
midwest gradually will occur in other parts of the country and 
around the world as more people begin preparing for natural 
disasters 
the 90s have been named the decade of emergency preparedness 
by the united nations gannon said

a leading teachers union official has quit as an 
advisor to the whittle communications service that provides 
commerciallysponsored news programs for classroom viewing 
albert shanker head of the american federation of teachers 
said he was resigning from the channel one council of advisors 
because his membership on the panel left the impression he was 
endorsing advertising in public schools 
but even as he stepped down from the 12member advisory board 
shanker apparently agreed to serve as host of a program for 
teachers that will be carried on a commercialfree companion 
service to channel one 
william gubbins a group editor at whittle communications said 
shanker is scheduled next week to tape the first segment of a 
monthly series the world of teaching an anthology designed 
for teachers 
the program will be carried on a private network that whittle is 
calling the educators channel that service will be delivered over 
the same system that carries channel one a daily 12minute news 
show with advertising for teens in the classroom into an estimated 
5000 schools 
shanker could not be reached monday to comment on his plans the 
aft offices in washington dc were closed for the veterans day 
holiday 
but according to an oct 12 letter sent to whittle chairman 
christopher whittle shanker said he made it clear when he agreed 
to be on the channel one advisory panel that my decision in no 
way constituted an endorsement either of the programming or of 
advertising in the public schools 
in fact i explicitly stated my role would be that of a watch 
dog shanker wrote 
shanker told whittle he should have known that being on the 
council would inevitably lead to the perception that i endorsed 
channel one 
but he said that realization was not driven home until he saw 
his name and picture being used in channel one promotional 
materials 
as a result he said he was resigning the post on the advisory 
council immediately and asked that his name and picture no longer 
be used on channel one promotional materials 
the situation was particularly sensitive for shanker since the 
policymaking arm of the teachers group he heads has gone on record 
against showing tv commercials in the classroom 
he noted the teachers panel also condemned the lack of 
resources that put schools and districts in the position of 
accepting commercials in return for equipment 
schools that agree to show the channel one news show with ads to 
their students every day are loaned a satellite dish videocassette 
recorder and tv monitors for every classroom for as long as they 
show the program 
the same satellite system is used to transmit the channel one 
news show and the educators channel to the schools 
tom ingram a spokesman for whittle communications in knoxville 
tenn said shanker also told the company other commitments had 
made it impossible for him to attend any of the advisory boards 
meetings 
he said whittle has agreed to take shankers name off any new 
promotional materials for channel one although the company will 
continue to use materials already in stock that may include his 
name or picture 
while we are sorry he was not able to participate on the 
advisory board we are excited about still having him on the 
educators network ingram said

the federal reserve responding to increasing 
signs of a recession soon will cut interest rates in a move that 
should prompt banks to lower a variety of consumer and business 
rates many private economists predicted monday 
the feds credit easing is likely to spur a onehalf percentage 
point cut in the prime lending rate and home mortgage rates should 
decline modestly as well many analysts said 
any reduction in the prime rate which has been stuck at 10 
percent since january would be seen as a boost to economic 
activity because about onethird of all consumer and business loans 
are tied to changes in the prime 
the feds top policymaking body the federal open market 
committee will meet behind closed doors tuesday to map interest 
rate strategy

to take greater control of operations at the 9monthold newspaper 
the moves come as the paper continues to absorb heavy losses in

backers of the newspaper have run into a miserable advertising 
climate and skepticism about the potential audience for a daily 
publication devoted exclusively to sports 
peter o price will continue to hold the titles president and 
publisher but will be involved with broad nonoperational issues 
a spokesman for the paper steve hammond said 
he said price would be involved for instance in planning for 
the rollout into new markets the national is currently available 
in nine markets with plans to expand into three more 
baltimorewashington philadelphia and atlanta by early 1991 
hammond said the three executives dismissed last week were diane 
morgenthaler circulation director timothy lasker assistant 
publisher and daniel w correa finance and administration 
director 
he said none of the three has yet been replaced he described 
the changes as a business decision but declined to elaborate 
price has been unavailable for comment for the past several 
days calls placed monday to price and all three dismissed 
executives were not returned 
hammond confirmed that jaime davila has been brought in to 
assume prices operating responsibilities at the newspaper whose 
biggest shareholder is emilio azcarraga the mexican media baron 
davila is a top executive at univisa inc the us subsidiary 
of mexicos televisa entertainment and publishing concern that 
azcarraga heads 
davila and azcarraga were also said to be unavailable for 
comment 
it was disclosed last week that the national will cease 
publishing a sunday edition after nov 25 and publish only on 
weekdays the paper had been publishing six days a week sunday 
through friday since its launch jan 31 
editorinchief frank deford also said last week there will be a 
handful of jobs cuts at the paper which employs about 200 people 
but that he was hopeful the cuts could be made through attrition 
rather than layoffs 
the national was launched in three cities new york chicago 
and los angeles and has since begun publishing editions in san 
diego san francisco detroit dallas boston and miami

oil fell more than 2 per barrel on the futures 
market monday as traders decided rising supplies posed a greater 
immediate threat than war in the persian gulf 
its deescalation of the war premium the prospect that war 
might be delayed said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst 
with shearson lehman brothers inc 
light sweet crude tumbled 202 to 3187 per barrel for 
december contracts on the new york mercantile exchange contracts 
for delivery of crude in later months all dropped trading volume 
was lighter than usual because of veterans day 
the drop followed a decline of 164 per barrel for next month 
delivery on friday when a wild rumor of an iraqi coup depressed 
prices at the end of the day 
traders on monday said war with iraq did not seem as likely in 
the near future because news stories have indicated president bush 
lacks the domestic and foreign support he needs to try to push 
iraqi troops out of kuwait 
a lot of people are feeling its not so close so theyre 
liquidating said christian gohler a broker with merrill lynch 
energy futures 
gohler said oil futures also fell because world oil supplies 
have been on the rise despite the boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti 
crude 
at the moment the market is being extremely well supplied 
because the opec nations and others have increased production to 
meet demand gohler said traders anticipated the next weekly 
statistics from the american petroleum institute which are to be 
released tuesday evening would show the us crude oil stockpile 
has increased 
hittle also pointed out that some sour crude is not being 
unloaded in europe because of a lack of immediate demand 
as oil took its dive monday so did most other energy futures 
traded on the exchange 
home heating oil was off 372 cents at 8652 cents a gallon for 
december contracts with contracts for delivery in later months all 
moving down as well 
unleaded gasoline fell 470 cents to 8353 per gallon for 
december contracts with later delivery month contracts falling 
natural gas futures were mixed with december contracts down 19 
cents at 241 per 1000 cubic feet 
separately the mercantile exchange announced steps monday that 
will enable oil traders to buy futures contracts up to 36 months in 
advance twice the current 18month limit the exchange asked 
regulators for the extention in august when iraqs invasion of 
kuwait threw world oil markets into a state of chaos 
with the growing volume and open interest in the back months 
of our existing contract industry need for a longterm hedging 
vehicle became evident the exchanges chairman z lou guttman 
said in a statement the more distant months will become available 
beginning nov 20

holiday session marked by indications that the united states will 
not go to war with iraq anytime soon said frederick demler a 
metals analyst with paine webber inc in new york 
the session came in with the japanese markets closed today 
because of the enthronement of a new emperor and later dropped

future demler said 
oil prices were off a little over 2 and the dow was up over 
60 points which was a negative for precious metals he said

microsoft corp chairman bill gates unveiled 
his grand vision of the future of personal computing monday an era 
in which desktop and handheld machines will provide a window to 
vast amounts of information 
in the keynote address at the giant comdex computer show gates 
described a future in which computers are much more useful and 
easier to use 
gates whose company developed the most widely used operating 
system for personal computers outlined new technologies that will 
bring video voice and handwriting recognition capabilities to 
personal computers 
this is a formidable challenge no single company is going to 
be able to do this he said 
gates called for cooperation among computer hardware and 
software companies to bring about his vision which he calls 
information at your fingertips 
in an amusing series of videos on a giant screen gates depicted 
how computers containing these new technologies would be used in 
the mythical town of twin points a spoof of the tv series twin 
peaks 
in one example he showed how a deliveryman for twin points 
bakery would use a booksized handheld computer that recognized 
handwriting to enter orders at a grocery store 
using a special pen or stylus the deliveryman wrote in the 
orders for various items on the computer screen the computer 
verified the order by printing the quantity 
when the grocer balked at ordering a certain amount of one item 
the deliveryman used the screen to display a bar chart showing how 
much of that item sold at the store in a certain period 
when the grocer also ordered a new display rack the computer 
flashed a warning that he was over his credit limit with the 
bakery 
but through a cellular phone device inside the machine the 
computer contacted a central computer at the bakery which then 
authorized the display rack but required the grocer to sign for 
it on the handheld computer screen using the stylus 
in another video gates showed how a student using a 
computerized encyclopedia could do a report on the state of 
washington where microsoft is based 
a page of the encyclopedia depicting facts about washington 
showed a picture of the state bird beside the bird was a small 
picture called an icon of several musical notes when the student 
moved an onscreen arrow to the icon and then pushed a button on a 
device called a mouse the computer played a short audio passage of 
the birds song stored in its memory 
the encyclopedia also gave a chart of the states leading 
industries software among them when the arrow was placed on 
microsoft a small picture of the companys offices came on the 
screen when the arrow was moved to the picture and the mouse 
button pushed the computer played a video of several of the 
companys employees 
gates also showed a video of a couple designing a house when 
they wanted to visualize various layouts their architect allowed 
them to walk through a threedimensional model of their 
proposed home on a computer screen the couple also could see on 
the screen how various color schemes would look and when they 
wanted to look at appliances the architect called up a video 
advertisement from an oven manufacturer 
gates 35 said these new technologies are not some science 
fiction dream but are under development or already in use in 
fact such combinations of text graphics sound and videos 
called multimedia computing are among the hot topics at this 
years comdex 
one of the keys to gates vision is tying together the 
technologies of handwriting recognition computerized video fax 
cellular phones computing networks and vast data bases in one 
seamless hardware and software package 
but he said several obstacles need to be removed before his 
scheme becomes reality 
one is that personal computers are too hard to use another he 
said is that people have a very narrow view of how the pc should 
be used 
gates speech kicked off a weeklong comdex show that promoters 
say has attracted about 120000 computer retailers distributors 
and others in the industry

firm those partnerships paid out as much as 2 billion between 
1981 and 1989 the house staffer said 
there was no indication how much of that amount was actually 
profit however and the amounts attributed to milken and other 
individuals were only estimates 
the house source who spoke on condition of anonymity also said 
monday that convicted stock speculator ivan f boesky testified 
behind closed doors to the oversight subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee about his dealings with milken 
the oversight subcommittee has been investigating hundreds of 
milkencreated drexel partnerships for several years but no 
evidence of illegal activity has been presented drexel ended the 
practice shortly after it came to light two years ago however 
a spokesman for milken declined comment on the matter 
but a source close to the milken camp noted the information 
about the huge payouts was disclosed shortly before the former head 
of drexels junk bond department is to be sentenced in a massive 
wall street fraud case 
milken pleaded guilty in april to six securitiesrelated felony 
charges and agreed to pay 600 million in penalties he faces up to 
28 years in prison when he is sentencd by a federal judge in new 
york who is expected to set a sentencing date soon 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the oversight 
subcommittee wants milken to testify after his sentencing 
about trading accounts owned by hundreds of limited partnerships he 
formed with drexel coworkers family members and friends 
the partnerships bought up significant percentages of hot junk 
bond issues before they were made available to the general public 
critics say the activity drove up the price of those issues at 
the expense of drexel customers 
federal prosecutors revealed that drexel paid milken mastermind 
of the firms rise to prominence in the highyield highrisk junk 
bond business a total of 11 billion between 1984 and 1987 
including 550 in the final year that 550 million paycheck put 
him the guiness book of world records 
the information stemming from the subcommittee probe while not 
proof of illegal activity suggests the magnitude of the deals and 
how lucrative they could be said the subcommitte source 
the information consisted of a list of 30 limited partnerships 
and the total amount each distributed to investors during the 
1980s 
but the onepage list does not specify individual investors nor 
does it indicate how much of the payouts were profit over and above 
the initial investment 
the subcommittee source said investigators knew from court 
documents what percentage major players in the drexel scandal held 
in the partnerships using that information combined with the 
totals generated by the gao probe you worked backwards to 
estimate amounts received by individuals said the source 
it gives you a pretty good road map in terms of who was 
involved in what he said 
milken who invoked his fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination when called to testify before the subcommittee 
two years ago is expected to testify after he is sentenced 
boesky who settled a massive insider trading case by pleading 
guilty to one felony count and agreeing to pay 100 million in 
penalties has been interviewed extensively by subcommittee 
staffers and testified for about three hours before the 
subcommittee in a closeddoor hearing in august the source said

savings and loan regulator timothy ryan 
told thrift executives monday that his agency will make it easier 
for them to convert their institutions into commercial banks 
the move based on a legal opinion by office of thrift 
supervision chief counsel harris weinstein could hasten the end of 
sampls as a separate financial industry 
ryan who is director of the thrift office told the 98th annual 
convention of the us league of savings institutions that he 
believed financial institutions could still earn a good profit as 
housing lenders 
the ranks of the most successful thrifts are dominated by 
those who stuck to the home mortgage business he said 
but he said sampls should also be free as contemplated under 
last years sampl bailout law to move into commercial banking if 
they desired 
the government so far has seized more than 500 failed sampls 
disposing of 300 of them most of the 300 have been turned over to 
banks also so far the thrift office has approved 22 applications 
from healthy thrifts wanting to become banks another 22 
applications are pending 
however he said he remained deeply troubled by sampls 
becoming state savings banks these institutions are similar to 
sampls but have fewer restrictions on how they may invest their 
deposits last years law for instance requires sampls but not 
state savings banks to devote 70 percent of their assets to home 
mortgage loans 
after delivering a speech to some 1300 sampl executives ryan 
told reporters that he was less concerned with the housing 
requirement which also can be circumvented by conversion to either 
a commercial bank or a savings bank and most concerned with sampls 
using conversion to evade bans on buying junk bonds and investing 
directly in speculative real estate development projects 
were not going to put up with that kind of behavior he 
said 
he noted that the federal deposit insurance corp was working on 
regulations to extend the reforms of last years law to savings 
banks in that case he said he would not oppose sampls converting to 
savings banks 
frederick l webber president of the league said most sampls 
want to convert not to evade reforms but to shed themselves of 
expensive examination fees charged by the thrift office 
as sampls fail or convert to banks fewer institutions remain 
behind to support the regulatory apparatus 
ryan drew cheers when he told sampl executives he would cut the 
assessments they pay he said he has already cut spending from a 
planned 330 million this year to 280 million and reduced his 
staff from 3500 to 3000 
despite the reductions he said he would increase the number of 
examiners in the field he said his goal was to examine large 
institutions and those in poor or average condition every year and 
others every 18 months 
ryan also drew cheers when he said he favored simplifying the 
regulatory apparatus so that only one agency regulates financial 
institutions many sampl executives have concluded that they would 
rather be supervised by banking regulators 
on another matter ryan said he was discussing with the 
resolution trust corp which dismantles failed thrifts a plan to 
delay seizing some virtually insolvent institutions 
the rtc has so far taken over more than 500 failed thrifts 
leaving about 2400 still operating privately of those the agency 
considers roughly 170 all but certain to fail 
but because congress adjourned without providing the rtc with 
additional rescue money ryan said his agency was considering 
placing some of the 170 into a supervisory management program 
provided they had little or no continuing losses and stable 
competent management 
when money became available later these sampls will be rescued 
without being transferred to the rtc he said

trans world airlines incs offer to merge with 
pan am corp raises new questions about troubled pan ams immediate 
future but analysts said monday they doubted the deal would fly 
as far as i can see its sort of hazy at the moment said 
thomas canning at standard amp poors weve got to wait for the 
reaction from pan am for their fiduciary duties they have to 
consider it 
analysts said pan am will probably proceed with plans to sell 
prized london routes to ual corp in a 400 million deal that also 
includes a cooperative marketing agreement the airlines would 
coordinate flights and feed passengers to each other 
pan am said that the ual deal which is supposed to be completed 
by wednesday was its current focus but pan am refused to 
comment on the merits or status of twas offer made friday in a 
letter from twa chairman carl c icahn to pan am chairman thomas g 
plaskett 
we are not going to comment on whether or not we have had any 
communications with mr icahn since we have received his letter 
pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon said 
she said however that pan am understood icahns offer would 
only come into play if the agreement with ual is not completed 
wednesday 
it is a binding agreement and the twa offer certainly does 
not change that agreement hanlon said but the ual deal does not 
prevent pan am from discussing a merger she said 
ual refused to say whether it believes the twa offer jeopardizes 
its pact with pan am talk to pan am spokesman joe hopkins 
said 
icahn proposed offering about 150 million in cash and 
securities with a face value of 300 million for pan am since the 
cash value of the securities would vary analysts were uncertain 
whether pan am stockholders would gain money or lose money through 
the transaction 
pan am stock rose to 1 in active trading monday 
pan am and twa are the only us carriers to fly into londons 
heathrow airport the most desirable destination in the city that 
is considered the gateway to europe analysts predicted a twapan 
am merger would face regulatory troubles because the government 
would not want to see all of those routes fall into the same 
corporate hands 
amr corp the parent of american airlines has said it would 
pay in excess of 500 million for the london routes but pan am 
said it was not interested in merely selling the routes pan am 
said its marketing arrangement with ual would help build up its 
latin american service with flights connecting through miami 
analysts said a twapan am merger would likely benefit both 
carriers considered among the weakest in an industry that has been 
hit hard by rising fuel costs and sluggish demand for travel 
it would make for a stronger carrier they would have the 
strength of the atlantic with the pan am latin american routes 
canning said 
even if no serious merger talks are held the publicity 
surrounding icahns offer has probably helped both both airlines 
according to an analyst with said icahn might have other motives 
what you see isnt what you get with this guy said kevin 
murphy of morgan stanley 
if he can prevent united airlines from going into london that 
would prevent a more formidable carrier from going into heathrow 
murphy said by creating more market forces for international 
assets and routes that can only come back and help him should he 
also decide to sell assets 
without a merger with pan am twa will be left in a position 
where it either needs to buy assets such as the atlanta hub and 
miami overhaul base of eastern airlines that it has expressed an 
interest in or sell its own assets analysts said 
the head of the twa branch of the air line pilots association 
kent scott agreed 
i think this is icahns way of stirring up interest in twa and 
saying hey i want to do a deal whether its buy sell or 
whatever scott said 
analysts say it was too soon to say whether the twa offer could 
spark any reshuffling that would involve more than two airlines 
they doubted the deal could enable pan am to seek better terms from 
ual because the important aspects of that deal had already been 
settled

the chairman of ab volvo monday promised an 
investigation of a phony television advertisement that portrayed a 
volvo withstanding the attempts of a monster truck to crush it 
volvo chairman pehr g gyllenhammar said in a statement that he 
would show customers suppliers and employees that i will never 
tolerate any kind of misconduct that will damage volvos name 
and excellent reputation 
the investigation would try to clarify how the ad came about and 
identify those resonsible he said 
volvo pulled the ads last week after admitting that the car in 
the ad had been reinforced the ads had been challenged by the 
texas attorney general 
volvo agreed to make no unproven claims run corrective 
newspaper ads and pay texas 316250 in investigative costs 
the ad filmed in austin appears to show a volvo as the only 
car left relatively intact after the truck runs over a line of 
autos 
it represents an insult to our company and what we represent 
and an insult against all volvo owners gyllenhammr said

county supervisors monday rejected 
chevron usas bid to carry oil from a rich offshore field by tanker 
instead of pipeline 
chevron says it is cheaper to send oil by tanker to refineries 
in los angeles 150 miles south a pipeline is considered the more 
expensive but environmentally safer alternative 
tom rogers chairman of the supervisors said chevron was only 
being held to tough standards it agreed to follow when a permit 
was granted for the offshore project some five years ago 
there is a pipeline available rogers said the symbolism 
is not local government holding up the oil companies if the oil 
companies and local government work something out what is the 
commitment of oil companies to adhere to those agreements 
the supervisors voted 41 after a daylong hearing 
chevron responded angrily saying santa barbara officials are 
not interested in reaching a rational solution 
the 2yearold dispute has idled a 25 billion oil project that 
includes three offshore oil rigs capable of producing up to 100000 
barrels of crude oil each day 
the three rigs hidalgo harvest and hermosa already are in 
place 10 miles off of santa barbara a processing plant and other 
facilities are nearby at point arguello 
chevron usa is lead partner on the project 
the firm sought a temporary fouryear shipping permit it was 
expected chevron would agree to pursue a pipeline operation if 
granted the permit but rogers said the issue was not raised 
rogers said existing pipelines could handle almost all of the 
crude produced by the offshore field sending the oil down to los 
angeles and up to northern california for processing 
they dont own pipelines they own tankers and that would 
maximize profit rogers said
