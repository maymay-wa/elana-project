house speaker jim wright is planning to ask the 
house to scale back the congressional pay raise scheduled to take 
effect next week even as house members were lining up 
overwhelmingly against the increase a congressional source said 
wednesday 
the 45500 pay raise a 51 percent hike will take effect next 
wednesday unless both the senate and house vote to block it 
wright dtexas plans to propose that the increase be scaled 
back to 30 percent said the source speaking on condition of 
anonymity a 30 percent raise would hike the current congressional 
salary from 89500 by 26850 to a total of 116350 
wright plans to seek a vote on approving the lower raise on feb 
9 the washington post reported in its thursday editions 
meanwhile house members indicated in an associated press survey 
that they want a vote on the sensitive issue 
survey results put additional pressure on wright to abandon a 
carefully orchestrated strategy of taking no vote until after the 
raise automatically takes effect next wednesday 
wright said tuesday he would hold a vote if that was what 
lawmakers wanted the speaker announced he was circulating a 
questionnaire privately to determine whether house members really 
wanted a recorded vote wrights tally was not made available 
wednesday 
however an associated press informal survey of nearly a third of 
the 435 house members showed about 88 percent of those responding 
wanted a vote on the pay raise 
meanwhile a survey of the entire house released wednesday by 
opponents of the pay raise showed 62 percent saying they would vote 
no if the issue came to a vote 
under the law members of congress and other top federal 
officials will get pay raises of about 50 percent on feb 8 unless 
both chambers reject it rankandfile congressional salaries would 
go from 89500 to 135000 under the recommendation submitted by 
former president reagan and supported by president bush 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine has promised a 
vote in his chamber this week surveys show the pay raise would be 
handily rejected there 
house democratic leaders with republican consent had adopted a 
strategy of avoiding a vote until after the deadline and then 
softening the political blow of the substantial pay raise by passing 
new ethics rules including a ban on lawmakers accepting speaking 
fees 
the strategy was based on the opinion that house members 
supported the raise but would find it politically impossible to vote 
for it 
wright who had been taking most of the political heat on the 
issue changed that strategy on tuesday his survey was designed in 
part to demonstrate that it was not jim wright alone who favored 
the pay increase 
over the past several weeks i have heard from many members on 
both sides of the aisle i have a pretty good idea of how they 
feel wright said they support regular procedure which 
would mean committee hearings and a legislative schedule that would 
make a vote impossible before the feb 8 deadline 
but when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise 
him and demand one wright said if the members want it yes of 
course 
the associated press contacted 143 congressional offices and 
found 92 members publicly supporting a recorded vote on the pay 
raise only six said they were against it and seven were undecided 
there was no response from 38 offices it should be noted that 
advocates of the pay raise have been reluctant to publicly indicate 
their support for fear of the political fallout 
mark johnson wrights spokesman said it would be wrong to use 
any informal surveys to predict the results of the speakers private 
survey 
however another top leadership aide speaking on the condition 
of anonymity pointed out that the speakers survey could compound 
the political problem if the results are at odds with those from 
media surveys 
several lawmakers who were following the leadership strategy of 
keeping silent on the issue privately expressed aggravation at the 
speakers new tactic 
this is like a war in which the general says to take the hill 
you turn around and find the generals gone said a republican 
member who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
if a vote were scheduled house members overwhelmingly would 
reject the pay increase according to a survey released wednesday by 
several groups opposed to the increase 
the survey said 270 house members or about 62 percent said they 
would oppose the raise if it came to a vote fortyseven or about 
11 percent said they would support the raise 75 members about 17 
percent declined to state a position and 41 members about 9 
percent declined to respond 
the survey was conducted by public citizen a consumer advocacy 
group founded by ralph nader the national taxpayers union a 
nonpartisan organization of fiscal conservatives and coalitions 
for america a conservative organization headed by activist paul 
weyrich 
after the survey was released rep thomas carper rdel said 
he too was against the raise even though the survey had listed him 
as undecided rep robert roe dnj was also listed as undecided 
but has been publicly opposed to the raise for more than a week 
a failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental 
breakdown of democracy said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen 
senate opponents of the pay increase at a hearing of the senate 
governmental affairs committee said the current system of allowing 
pay increases to take effect without a vote was hurting congress 
public image 
what must they think of us when we run from accountability as 
cockroaches run from bright light said sen gordon humphrey 
rnh 
sen jesse helms rnc told the committee that people all 
over the united states are saying theyre a bunch of crooks 
but committee member ted stevens ralaska said the raise was 
needed especially for judges and federal officials 
what does it cost government to have incompetent people at the 
top stevens asked 
with the future of the pay raise uncertain house and senate 
negotiators were moving ahead wednesday with their separate but 
similar efforts to draft ethics legislation to bar honoraria and 
restrict other outside income

president bush may be getting his ducks in a 
row on the federal budget but he certainly doesnt want any of his 
budget lines to turn up as ducks 
thats because a duck by any other name in washington these days 
is a tax increase 
and bush administration officials insist therell be no ducks 
new taxes in the budget plan bush sends congress on feb 9 
this duck business started when budget director richard g darman 
wrote a letter to the senate governmental affairs committee 
reaffirming bushs intention to resist new taxes 
on whether the administration might hide a tax under another 
name darman suggested that wouldnt wash most americans he 
suggested know that if it walks like a duck and quacks like a 
duck it must be a duck 
thats an old line but darman gave it new currency 
now it has joined the lexicon of other budget cliches mentioned 
almost as frequently these days as that mythical budget table 
that items are always described as being off or on 
as in nothings off the table or everythings on the 
table 
not to mix metaphors but ducks are off the table darman 
told congress 
bush himself has picked up on the duck talk 
at his first news conference he was asked whether a treasury 
proposal for a depositor fee to assist troubled savingsandloans 
might violate his antitax stand 
i would refer you to richard darman the president responded 
hes the guy that defined that very well up there with the duck 
test on the hill 
darman repeatedly used the duck analogy during his confirmation 
hearings he was presented at one point with a mock trophy by 
committee chairman sen john glenn dohio 
it consisted of three bright yellow toy ducks and the label if 
it quacks its a tax 
white house chief of staff john sununu threw yet another 
ingredient into the duck soup a rose 
asked at a news conference whether he thought the savings and 
loan fee was a tax sununu responded obliquely yesterdays rose 
is tomorrows rose 
when he did not elaborate further he was asked a rose is a 
rose and it passes the rose test 
lets put it this way sununu said yesterdays duck is 
tomorrows duck 
actually todays duck is not yesterdays duck so far as bush is 
concerned bushs duck of yesteryear was not a tax increase but a 
sandinista 
when running for reelection in 1984 thenvice president bush 
caused something of a stir in a campaign speech at texas aampm 
university as he portrayed the sandinista government in nicaragua as 
marxist 
if you walk like a duck and you quack like a duck and you say 
youre a duck youre a duck he said 
but so far the new bush administration hasnt reported any 
conversations with tax ducks

more than 700 boeing jetliners operated by 
every major us airline must undergo a comprehensive inspection for 
crosswiring and crossplumbing in their safety systems after 
problems were discovered in 17 aircraft 
the federal aviation administraton in issuing the 
airworthiness directive late tuesday also noted that boeing is 
studying its design production procedures and testing of airliner 
emergency systems to see if changes are needed 
the newly ordered tests are not expected to disrupt airline 
schedules and can be completed anytime over the next 3 weeks while 
the airliners are undergoing routine maintenance 
the order affects 741 newer jetliners flown by us carriers it 
applies to all boeing 737s 747s 757s and 767s built after dec 31 
1980 most foreign airliners using the planes also are expected to 
comply although the faa has no jurisdiction over them 
the comprehensive directive will require functional testing 
of the engine and cargo compartment fire detection warning and 
extinguishing systems both electrical and plumbing to insure that 
crossed wiring or plumbing does not exist said the faa 
announcement 
no accident or emergency has resulted from faulty wiring or 
plumbing found in airliners in recent weeks after the faa issued 
limited directives applying to only specific systems in certain 
types of aircraft 
but the foulups including crosswiring crossplumbing 
incomplete wiring and other problems could have caused shutdown of 
the wrong engine in the event of fire activation of the wrong 
sprinkling system in a cargo hold or lack of any response in 
emergency systems 
the concern arose with speculation that the pilot in a jan 8 
british midland airways 737 crash that killed 44 people in england 
may have been deceived by faulty wiring into shutting down his only 
good engine cause of the crash is still under investigation 
the crash led to similar inspection orders in great britain 
airbus 320s also were included in the british order although 
problems have been found only in boeing aircraft 
jack gamble boeing spokesman said tuesday night that the 
directive is based on service bulletins boeing has been putting out 
in recent months and years service bulletins are sent out each time 
a problem of some sort is found with a model of a plane to all 
carriers using that model and to the faa checks of planes are 
voluntary after a service bulletin is issued 
but if the faa sees a pattern in the bulletins it is likely to 
issue a directive making checks of the airliners mandatory 
its a preventive and precautionary check he said 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the latest order which gives 
airlines 25 days to comply would not disrupt regularly scheduled 
flights he said planes whose systems were already tested under 
previous orders need not retest under the new order 
boeings gamble said a lot of the 57 and 37 stuff already has 
been done 
the faa estimated the inspections would cost airlines a total of 
222000 airline analysts say however that actual cost of 
faaordered inspections is generally two or three times higher than 
the faa estimates 
it said the order is a precautionary measure triggered by 
newly discovered problems with three 757s and a 737 farrar said he 
did not know which airlines reported the latest cases of faulty 
wiring 
on one plane an overheat indicator would have shown a problem in 
the wrong engine in two others fire extinguishers would have been 
triggered in the wrong engines in the fourth an incomplete circuit 
would have prevented a fire extinguisher from firing 
the first crosswiring directive applying only to two 737 models 
found no problems a second triggered by reports of crosswiring in 
two 757s resulted in discovery of five more miswired aircraft 
earlier directives followed discovery of improperly installed 
plumbing in two 767s the inspections exposed four other aircraft 
with similar problems that in the event of a fire in one of two 
holds would have routed extinguishing fluids to the hold that was 
not burning 
the inspections would cover 472 boeing 737s 33 jumbo 747s 123 
757s and 113 767s the faa said

authorities have discovered the bodies 
of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a 
trailer compound and one of the residents has been charged with two 
of the deaths 
the body of a man found tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a 
junkyard near the threetrailer compound appeared to have been shot 
twice in the back of the head at close range said assistant state 
medical examiner dr vasudeo kshirsagar 
the condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead 
several months kshirsagar said adding that the five others 
appeared to have been killed in a similar manner 
police believe the body is that of 20yearold michael schillings 
of north carolina who came to the compound to live last spring and 
was reported missing last summer 
on monday the body of 22yearold jimmy price was found on the 
site about 30 feet from the car authorities said the junkyard is 
about 200 yards east of the compound where the first two bodies 
were discovered jan 8 
we have a consistent pattern it was a shotgun it was 
consistent with the other cases said kanawha county sheriff art 
ashley 
if all six bodies are linked to the same killer it would be the 
worst series of deaths in west virginia attributed to the same 
person 
authorities said 19yearold mark southern mccallister is being 
held without bond on charges of murdering brothers billy and otis 
sanson who lived with mccallister at the compound in st albans a 
town of 15000 people 15 miles west of charleston 
prosecutors said mccallister has confessed to the brothers 
murders 
police found the body of the sansons sister bonnie pauley at 
an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on jan 21 
another victim mccallisters grandmother charlotte farrell 69 
was found in her nearby home 
we hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint 
of looking for people ashley said 
the sheriffs department declined to say whether mccallister 
would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive 
however authorities said all the victims lived at the compound 
which is now abandoned and price and schillings had dated bonnie 
pauley

want to see how some robots of the future may 
find their way around hold a finger in front of you and stare at it 
now shake your head still focusing on that finger 
objects behind your finger appear to move in the same direction 
as your head while those in front of it move in the opposite 
direction 
using that principle researchers have demonstrated a fast method 
for depth perception in visually guided robots which should help 
them navigate around objects more quickly a scientist says 
a robot at the university of rochester in new york state trains a 
pair of cameras on an object to gauge the distance to it said dana 
ballard a computer science professor at the university 
the distance measurement is updated 30 times a second ballard 
said so it potentially allows you to move at high speed 
current robots guided by visual feedback can move only slowly 
because of the time it takes them to judge the location of objects 
in their path he said tuesday 
chuck thorpe research scientist at the robotics institute of 
carnegiemellon university in pittsburgh said the rochester robot 
is the first to combine several previously known concepts into such 
a highspeed system 
the cameras are mounted on a motordriven platform that allows 
them to move up and down or side to side the platform is mounted on 
the end of a large industrial robot arm allowing the platform to 
move over a range about 12 feet in diameter at speeds up to about 
one yard per second 
currently a human directs the cameras to a reference point but 
eventually that will occur automatically ballard said in a 
telephone interview 
the work shows it is easier for computers to calculate distance 
to objects if the images come from moving cameras than if the 
cameras are stationary he said 
the research also demonstrated a way for the pair of cameras to 
remain locked on an object while it moves toward the robot an 
ability called vergence he said 
the work was led by ballard and colleague chris brown

the african national congress 
has asked antiapartheid activist winnie mandela to disband her 
group of teenage bodyguards which has been accused of kidnapping 
and engaging in gang feuds 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu and community leaders in the 
black township of soweto support disbanding the group known as the 
mandela united soccer club saying it hurts the campaign to end 
white minority rule 
several newspapers have reported that continuing allegations that 
the youth group has engaged in unlawful behavior have become a 
source of friction between mrs mandela and her husband nelson 
south africas bestknown black leader 
nelson mandela has been imprisoned since 1962 for his anc 
activities 
winnie cant afford to have the mandela name dragged through 
the mud by associating with these people tutu said in new york 
the johannesburg newspaper business day reported tuesday 
at the lusaka zambia headquarters of the outlawed anc spokesman 
tom sebina said tuesday that the message about mandela united was 
sent to mrs mandela after discussions among the organizations 
leaders 
the youths who generally wear track suits often accompany mrs 
mandela to public gatherings 
mrs mandela last week said she had disbanded the group because 
of state harassment but several of the youths were present 
saturday when she attended the funeral of a slain activist 
while guarding mrs mandela the youths occasionally have 
threatened journalists and others 
in july the mandela family home in soweto was destroyed in a 
fire set by a gang of black high school students who had been 
feuding with mandela united members 
mandela united also has been accused of abducting four youths 
from a soweto church one of the four still is missing mrs mandela 
and others have alleged the kidnapped youths may have been sexually 
abused by a church clergyman 
about 150 soweto community leaders met last week to investigate 
the abductions and later urged that mandela united be disbanded 
mrs mandela widely viewed abroad as a hero of the fight against 
the white minority governments policy of racial separation has 
become entangled in several controversies in recent years 
she has endorsed necklace killings whereby black activists 
set alight gasolinesoaked tires placed around the necks of 
socalled government collaborators 
she also has been criticized for building the mansion in soweto 
although she has never moved into it

almost half of the nations senior citizens who 
may be eligible for supplemental security income benefits are not 
enrolled in the program according to the american association of 
retired persons 
ssi provides monthly cash payments to eligible lowincome people 
who are 65 years and older blind or disabled the maximum federal 
ssi benefit this year is 368 a month for an individual and 553 a 
month for a couple 
some states supplement the payments with their own funds the 
department of health and human services estimates that 36 percent of 
ssi recipients receive state supplements 
the study conducted for aarp by icf inc a research and 
consulting firm said its finding was consistent with other surveys 
that have put the ssi participation rate at about 50 percent 
another study conducted for aarp by louis harris and associates 
found that onethird of the eligible older people who are not 
receiving ssi benefits have never heard of the program and many 
others are misinformed about eligibility requirements 
ssi paid about 123 billion in federal benefits last fiscal year 
and is budgeted to pay out 125 billion this year

a food and drug administration panel has set 
new guidelines on how often people need dental xrays saying its 
goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure 
children with healthy teeth may need dental xrays no more than 
once every year or two and dentally healthy adults once every two 
or three years the panel said 
the guidelines reported in the current issue of the journal of 
the american dental association were prompted by concern among some 
experts about the frequency of dental xrays both overuse and 
underuse 
although the radiation risk from a dental xray is extremely 
low our goal is to eliminate any unneeded radiation exposure fda 
commissioner frank e young said in statement tuesday 
until these guidelines were developed there were few concrete 
criteria a dentist could use in deciding when xrays were needed 
he said 
young also stressed the flexibility of the guidelines saying 
these are not hard and fast rules in deciding whether an xray is 
needed the dentist must use clinical judgment in evaluating the 
patients needs

president ranasinghe premadasa who 
completes a turbulent first month in office today is trying hard to 
vanquish a legacy of ethnic violence and chart a more peaceful 
course for his island nation 
since taking over jan 2 he has freed more than 1400 political 
prisoners and lifted tough emergency laws that were imposed 5 years 
ago in an effort to control an insurgency by minority tamil 
extremists 
political rivals credit premadasa with shrewd moves he had to 
do something startling with the looming general elections 
scheduled for feb 15 said kumar ponnabalam leader of the 
opposition all ceylon tamil congress 
despite premadasas efforts an extremist group whose members are 
of the sinhalese ethnic majority has stepped up attacks aimed at 
thwarting the vote 
police say the peoples liberation front killed 600 people in 
january alone a western diplomat speaking on condition of 
anonymity termed the figure a bit farfetched but declined to 
say how many people he thought had been killed 
for premadasa who served as prime minister under former 
president junius r jayewardene the parliamentary elections will be 
vital since his plans could be stalled if his united national party 
does not gain a parliamentary majority 
the period to come is premadasas greatest challenge said 
ralph bultjens a veteran sri lankawatcher and a political science 
professor at the new school in new york feb 15 is his most 
urgent hour 
in the year leading up to the dec 19 presidential election 
sinhalese extremists killed more than 800 people mostly government 
officials supporters and police authorities said 
most of the victims were sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of 
the indian ocean islands 16 million people and dominate the 
government which the front says has made too many concessions to 
the tamils 
during his election campaign premadasa took pains not to blame 
the sinhalese guerrillas for the violence instead he made fervent 
appeals to the front to lay down arms and join mainstream politics 
but premadasas gamble failed said another western diplomat 
who spoke on condition of anonymity the sinhalese extremists are 
bent upon violence and will not heed appeals 
despite the violence premadasa will fulfill campaign promises to 
help the poor said ranjan wijeratna chairman of the united 
national party 
premadasa plans to give 75 monthly to 14 million families that 
live in extreme poverty the annual per capita income of nearly half 
the countrys population is well below the national average of 360 
some of premadasa campaign promises that have already 
materialized 3500 indian soldiers were withdrawn and india agreed 
to consider premadasas promise to change the indiansri lankan 
peace accord into a friendship treaty 
the july 1987 accord an attempt to end the tamil insurgency 
allowed indian troops onto the island to disarm tamil guerrillas 
but indias attempt to play peacemaker for its southern neighbor 
met with resistance from tamil militants and at least 600 indian 
soldiers have been killed about 44000 indian soldiers remain in 
the country 
the tamil separatist war has claimed about 8500 lives most of 
them sinhalese civilians

the appearance of viruses that can escape the 
herpes drug may be an early sign that a new class of medicines 
designed to wipe out viruses will be outwitted by its foes just as 
bacteriakilling drugs have been researchers say 
diseasecausing herpes viruses that are resistant to the widely 
used drug acyclovir have been seen in aids patients who have little 
natural ability to ward off microbes 
resistant viruses have not been found in otherwise healthy people 
who take the drug for ordinary outbreaks of genital herpes sores 
researchers disagree over whether the resistant viruses will spread 
into the general population 
we see no lack of efficacy of acyclovir in normal patients i 
dont think it should be a concern at all said dr nick ellis a 
senior scientist at burroughs wellcome co which produces the drug 
however dr martin s hirsch of massachusetts general hospital 
said the current situation may parallel the development of 
penicillin in the 1940s 
for the last 40 years its been a battle between the organism 
and the drug to see which can outwit the other and its been a 
series of new drugs to try to overcome bacterial resistance 
hirsch said in an interview viruses have never presented that 
problem up until now but it wouldnt surprise me that during the 
next 40 years we see the same kind of phenomenon developing in 
virology 
two reports on drugresistant viruses are being published in 
thursdays new england journal of medicine 
in one of the studies doctors described the cases of 12 aids 
patients who developed severe herpes infections that did not respond 
to acyclovir one coauthor dr john mills of san francisco general 
hospital estimates that one in 1000 aids patients has 
acyclovirresistant herpes 
in the other study doctors reported two aids victims and one 
leukemia patient who had overwhelming cytomegalovirus or cmv 
infection that could not be treated with ganciclovir a 
stillexperimental antiviral drug 
researchers believe that resistance occurs through natural 
genetic mutation a strain of the virus emerges that has genes 
making it impervious to a drug then the resistant strain multiplies 
and spreads through the victims body while all the other forms of 
the virus are killed off by the medicine 
an estimated 30 million americans are infected with the genital 
herpes virus known as herpes simplex virus type 2 most of them 
never develop any symptoms but for the minority with recurring 
genital sores acyclovir is the only treatment although others are 
being tested 
cytomegalovirus infects an estimated 60 percent to 90 percent of 
americans and rarely causes illness in otherwise healthy people 
however in those whose disease defenses are weak the virus can 
attack organs through the body resulting in blindness or death 
ever since acyclovirs introduction seven years ago as the first 
widely available antiviral drug some virus researchers have worried 
that the herpes virus would evolve into forms that could elude the 
medicine and still cause disease 
what we had feared for many years would happen now appears to 
be happening at least in the aids population said hirsch 
dr m colin jordan of the university of minnesota a coauthor 
of one of the studies said he expects drugresistant viruses to 
complicate treatment of organ transplant patients they must take 
immunitylowering drugs to keep their bodies from rejecting their 
new organs 
since the drugresistant viruses have not been seen in healthy 
people doctors cannot be sure whether the viruses will become a 
problem for the general population 
one concern is that someone with aids could give one of these 
resistant viruses to someone else and then it could become 
established in the normal population said jordan 
dr clyde s crumpacker of bostons beth israel hospital another 
coauthor of the research said he doubts this will happen 
i have been aware of most of the cases of resistance that have 
occurred and it is an unlikely event he said it is not 
occurring in the normal population that we have been watching

a judge today acquitted a prominent 
supporter of ferdinand marcos of rebellion saying his takeover of a 
provincial government during a 1987 coup attempt was not violent 
enough to merit conviction 
but judge maximiano asuncion sentenced orlando dulay to 10 months 
in prison and fined him the equivalent of 50 for trying to strangle 
the governor and holding other officials and employees of quirino 
province during the aug 28 1987 coup attempt in which 53 people 
were killed in manila 
it was the most serious of about a halfdozen coup attempts since 
president corazon aquino rose to power in a february 1986 revolt 
that sent marcos into exile in hawaii 
records of the case show that dulay and about 50 rebel soldiers 
and police barged into the capitol building in the qurino provincial 
capital of cabarroguis and announced a takeover of the local 
government 
but in acquitting dulay and four other defendants asuncion said 
that announcing a takeover and appointing new officials are not 
sufficient to hold them liable for the crime of rebellion 
to constitute rebellion there must be some sort of public 
uprising which is absent in the instant case said the judge 
and when we say public uprising there must be men engaging in war 
against the forces of government 
in order to commit the crime rebellion there must be public 
uprising and taking of arms against the government the judge 
added 
dulay has been in jail since march 1987 longer than his 
sentence but asuncion did not order dulays release because he 
faces charges of murdering two supporters of mrs aquino during the 
february 1986 presidential election 
dulay was in jail in quirino 100 miles north of manila pending 
trial on the murder charges when the coup attempt began some of the 
soldiers and policemen who preceded him to the capitol building 
during the brief takeover were his prison guards 
during the trial prosecutors presented witnesses who described 
how dulay wrung the neck of gov renicolas delizo and yelled 
goddamn you will die i will kill you dulay who was dressed 
in military combat fatigues then put a gun to delizos head the 
witnesses said 
dulay and his armed followers next herded delizo and others into 
the governors office and held them there until midnight when it 
became clear in manila that the coup attempt had failed 
dulay acknowledged that he grabbed delizo by the neck but claimed 
that was merely for psychological effect 
he also said it was not he was who tried to takeover quirino 
dulay headed the provincial chapter of the new society movement 
in quirino 
he and his followers were accused of murdering two civilians 
campaigning for mrs aquino in quirino during the 1986 election 
which both mrs aquino and marcos claimed they won 
dulay was arrested shortly after marcos left but escaped from a 
suburban manila military prison he resurfaced in the united states 
but was expelled back to manila on march 18 1987 
last june armed men attacked the stockade at manilas camp 
crame where dulay was held in what the military said was a bid to 
free him the group failed to free dulay but looted the garrisons 
armory

armed with cash and cameras foreign 
trekkers by the thousands are scouring the hills of northern 
thailand for unspoiled tribal people turning the region into a 
human zoo critics say 
thai officials christian missionaries and others interviewed say 
these increasingly popular treks by western europeans americans and 
australians are hastening the erosion of traditional culture among 
500000 tribal people already reeling under rapid modernization 
villagers are selling their colorful costumes jewelry and other 
heirlooms or exchanging them for jeans and other western goods 
offered by trekkers and intruding brusquely into village life are 
some westerners who as former tour operator bill young recalls 
run around with their breasts hanging out 
nothing is free now their traditional hospitality has been 
corrupted says american missionary david morse before they 
would offer food and lodging to strangers now they no longer accept 
people for who they are they have become hardened less open 
according to the governments tourist authority tribal trekking 
has grown from a handful of hikers in the 1970s to more than 100000 
last year 
most sign up with tour companies in this major northern thai 
city then make their way by jeep bamboo raft elephant motorcyle 
or foot to the hill villages of the akha karen hmong lisu lahu 
and other tribes 
the trekking companies capitalize on the regions natural beauty 
and the lure of the exotic and notorious the area is part of the 
socalled golden triangle of opium fields and warlord armies 
padaung hill tribes now available reads one typical 
advertisement which has prompted critics to charge that the tribal 
people are being marketed like animals on a safari or in a zoo 
young a longtime american resident of northern thailand says 
trekking agencies vary greatly 
some he says educate clients about local cultures while others 
may offer an opium experience and provide opportunities for 
authentic photographs by getting tribesmen to smoke their opium 
pipes or engage in courtship rituals 
some trekkers have died of drug overdoses violence and robbery 
against tourists once unheard of are on the rise as cultures 
clash and cash is haphazardly injected into primitive economies 
suppakit apasil director of the governments tourism office in 
chiang mai says part of the trouble stems from lack of controls 
over the mushrooming agencies and the trekking industry which 
brings 5 million annually to the city 
chiang mai has 110 agencies some no more than a table in a 
restaurant catering to backpackers offering tours that range from 
6 to 100 and guides whose knowledge of tribal languages and lore 
varies as widely 
the government has no regulatory powers but provides wouldbe 
trekkers with a list of warnings and recommendations and helped 
organize a jungle tour club an association of about 50 trekking 
outfits that attempts to raise standards 
wanat bruksasri who heads the hill tribe research institute 
lists tourism among factors changing hill tribe life other factors 
are greater road access population growth an influx of lowlanders 
and the impact of foreign and thai development agencies 
see real primitive hill tribes in the thai jungle if youre 
looking for an intensive and unforgettable experience announces 
one trekking company but some who sign up are in for a 
disappointment 
after a long walk through deforested hills trekkers may well 
come upon a village where the natives watch television drive 
japanese pickup trucks and wear jeans purchased from previous 
trekkers

the bush administration is giving qualified 
support to cutting the tax deduction for interest on debt incurred 
in leveraged buyouts saying it prefers fairer tax treatment of 
traditional forms of raising capital 
if youre going to make a change and clearly were not 
suggesting one we would suggest that you look in the area of 
perhaps limiting interest deductions and using that money to give a 
break to corporate owners of stock treasury secretary nicholas 
brady told the taxwriting house ways and means committee on tuesday 
brady said the driving force behind the lbo phenomenon is 
that companies can avoid a 34 percent corporate income tax rate by 
raising capital through debt rather than stock 
he said the treasury department also has been attempting to find 
a way through internal revenue service regulations or a legislative 
proposal to make the tax treatment of stockequity and bonddebt 
financing more equal 
the lbo problem would disappear with a level playing field 
he said but so far we havent been able to come up with a way to 
do it 
brady also suggested that the best action might be inaction 
we have a habit of correcting things just as they are about to 
correct themselves brady said if we wait a little longer this 
thing is not going to gobble us up 
but brady conceded the administration is concerned about the 
rapid rate with which companies are going into debt to launch 
takeovers or defend against them through stock buybacks both often 
financed by highinterest junk bonds 
rep jj pickle dtexas likened bradys qualified endorsement 
of taxing interest on takeoverrelated debt to a kiss through a 
veil and criticized him for not coming up with specific 
suggestions or data on the impact of the buyouts on the federal 
treasury 
with a that depends answer brady evaded a question on 
whether president bushs desire to reduce the capital gains tax 
would only encourage more buyouts since shareholders would have to 
pay less tax on the 35 percent to 45 percent abovemarket prices 
they often get in the transactions 
rep dan rostenkowski dill said it is ironic the outcry for 
congressional action to curb takeovers has become deafening in 
the past 16 months 
in 1987 the house had approved similar legislation to limit the 
tax deductibility of interest on junk bonds and other borrowing used 
in financing takeovers 
but it suffered a quick death in negotiations with the senate 
after thentreasury secretary and now secretary of state james a 
baker tried to blame the bill as the cause of the october 1987 stock 
market crash 
since then the size of companies being taken over through junk 
bonds has increased several times and instead of just plants 
closing and workers losing jobs owners of more traditional 
longterm investmentgrade bonds in the companies being acquired 
have seen the value of their holdings diminished in some takeovers 
for example holders of some 5 billion in longterm bonds in 
rjrnabisco co lost 1 billion overnight when credit agencies 
downgraded their rating upon the announcement of the companys 
takeover by lbo specialist kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
rostenkowski and other lawmakers also have questioned whether 
many of the newly restructured companies will be able to make the 
interest payments on their much higher debt and avoid bankruptcy if 
and when a recession occurs 
i have a feeling that were looking at a richter scale thats 
showing zero and then we have an eruption of 7 or 8 on the scale and 
its too late said rep thomas j downey dny using a major 
earthquake as a metaphor

the watergate cases of the mid1970s could 
provide a road map for selection of a jury in oliver norths trial 
that will not be biased by pretrial publicity legal experts say 
i would say watergate is your best guide from what i can 
understand the irancontra hearings wont exceed publicity of 
that says professor william greenhalgh of the georgetown 
university law center 
there are important parallels between the prosecution of the 
leading watergate defendants and norths case greenhalgh said 
tuesday most notably he said the trials in both instances were 
preceded by congressional hearings that attracted vast television 
audiences 
a federal appeals court upheld the watergate convictions saying 
the defendants rights were protected by the careful questioning of 
prospective jurors to guard against prejudice from pretrial 
publicity 
thats what us district judge gerhard gesell is doing 
now greenhalgh said he has a road map and if hes following 
it i think hell be all right 
professor david robinson jr of george washington university 
agreed we have an imperfect system that stumbles through he 
said its not an impossibility to get a jury in the north trial 
that will be unbiased 
robinson also said it is easier to guard against prejudiced 
jurors in federal cases because the judges generally do the 
questioning in empaneling jurors in the state courts he said the 
quizzing is done by the lawyers on each side 
as norths trial began tuesday gesell said there may be problems 
finding an impartial jury as required by the constitution because so 
many people have seen or read of norths testimony in congressional 
hearings 
only 16 of the first 54 prospective jurors indicated on 
questionnaires that they werent exposed to norths congressional 
appearances the judge said 
north a former white house aide testified to house and senate 
investigating committees in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity 
the immunity grant meant the congressional testimony itself could 
not be used to prosecute north although independent counsel 
laurence walsh was free to develop the same information 
independently 
gesell noted that norths trial on charges of lying to congress 
shredding evidence and conspiring to commit tax fraud comes after 
intense publicity and the judge said the spotlight will remain on 
throughout the trial 
gesell said he will rule wednesday on how much exposure to such 
publicity ought to be allowed before a possible juror is 
disqualified 
north himself has contributed to the attention his trial is 
receiving in recent months he has been giving speeches for 20000 
fees 
the supreme court has made it clear that pretrial publicity is 
not necessarily fatal to a fair trial 
the justices most recent ruling on the issue was in 1984 when 
by a 62 vote they reinstated the murder conviction of a 
pennsylvania high school teacher for raping and strangling a student 
the court stressed in that case that the conviction came years 
after the offense occurred allowing ample time for the communitys 
sense of outrage to cool 
justice lewis f powell writing for the court said the trial 
judge has broad discretion to decide whether prospective jurors are 
biased 
under our system it is that judge who is best situated to 
determine competency to serve impartially powell said 
the high court in 1961 provided some guidelines for permissible 
pretrial publicity 
justice tom c clark writing for the court then said it is not 
necessary for jurors to be totally ignorant of the facts and 
issues involved he said requiring them to know nothing would 
amount to an impossible standard

returning from lunch breaks drunk

ranchers armed with blankets and shovels 
helped more than 100 firefighters battle a prairie fire that raced 
through the panhandle tuesday consuming 8000 acres of grassland 
farm buildings and at least one home 
firefighters said a 25foot wall of flames was fueled by winds 
gusting in excess of 45 mph as it made its way across morrill and 
garden counties for more than eight hours into tuesday night 
no injuries were reported some hot spots were still burning late 
tuesday night but authorities said the fire was under control by 
about 830 pm 
ken loxterkamp broadwaters assistant fire chief said minimal 
damage was reported because few buildings exist in the area 
this is all ranch country its all grassland it burned up 
into some of the yards in one place there were two houses in the 
same area they saved the one house but lost the other loxterkamp 
said 
he said more than 100 firefighters were at the scene at one time 
cyndi messersmith of the alliance fire department said the fire 
started east of angora about noon and burned more than 8000 acres 
most of the damage to farm buildings including the burned house 
was reported north of bridgeport about 25 miles south of alliance 
al kosel of the national weather service in scottsbluff said 
winds across the panhandle gusted at up to 47 mph tuesday afternoon

there is no proven link between alcoholic 
beverage advertising and drunkenness say broadcasters and 
advertisers who contend theyre being made scapegoats in the war on 
drunken driving 
the national association of broadcasters along with major 
advertising industry groups and alcoholic beverage makers on 
tuesday said recommendations by a us surgeon generals workshop 
that restrictions be placed on alcohol ads were a wellmeaning but 
constitutionally unsupportable attack on commercial speech 
wallace s snyder of the american advertising federation said the 
workshop recommendations are clearly unconstitutional and 
discriminatory because of a lack of evidence showing any link 
between alcoholic beverage advertising and consumption let alone 
abuse 
were really concerned that censorship of truthful advertising 
is contagious and we would be on a slippery slope and all sorts of 
product advertising would come under fire snyder said 
restricting ads does not get at the root causes of drunkenness 
a problem that must be approached by expanded public education the 
groups said 
at a news conference industry representatives attacked the 
recommendations presented to surgeon general c everett koop in 
december by a workshop on drunken driving the broadcasters and 
advertisers said they were writing to koop to urge him as one 
official put it to reject these hasty and misguided proposals 
the nab and the advertising industry declined to participate in 
the workshop last year claiming it was stacked against advertisers 
interests 
advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio and television 
totaled 931 million in 1987 the nab said the industry 
representatives tuesday said they stood ready to increase their 
campaigns against alcohol abuse 
snyder said he hoped koop would recognize the antidrunkenness 
efforts being made by the advertising industry and not to get into 
a confrontational mode but to try to solve this problem by talking 
banning alcohol advertising and marketing will have no effect 
on the drunk driving problem other than to provide false 
satisfaction that something is being done nab president edward o 
fritts said in a statement 
research shows that the first step toward solving the tragedy 
of drunk driving is to make drunkenness socially unacceptable 
fritts said attempts to scapegoat any one element of society are 
counterproductive and in the workshops case totally without 
merit 
however the presidential national commission against drunk 
driving reported in december that teenagers testified during public 
hearings with near unanimity that advertising encourages 
adolescents to drink the commission said drunken driving was the 
no 1 killer of teens 
the federal centers for disease control said 23632 people were 
killed in the united states in 1987 in vehicular accidents in which 
alcohol was involved 
the workshops recommendations to koop included banning alcohol 
ads and promotion and sponsorship of public events where the 
majority of the audience is under the legal drinking age 
elimination of advertising that portrays activities that are 
combined with alcohol use banning sponsorship of athletic events by 
the alcoholic beverage industry and blocking the use of celebrities 
who have a strong appeal to young people in alcohol advertising and 
promotion 
nab representative chuck sherman said the nab had recommended to 
koop that 
broadcastings ongoing public service announcements campaign 
should be broadened and developed to make the public aware that 
getting drunk is socially unacceptable 
an education campaign should be developed to explain the 
difference between taking a drink and getting drunk 
individuals can and should be trained and educated to 
recognize an impending intoxication in others and trained to 
intervene effectively 
families must be taught that education about drinking 
practices begins at home 
incentives should be promoted to encourage antidrunkenness 
efforts 
jim brown a spokesman for the public health service said koop 
would have no immediate comment on the comments by the broadcasters 
and advertisers he said koop would review the panels 
recommendations and public comments and then issue his own views

the nations farmers began 1989 on a price 
upswing that saw them receiving more for their cattle hogs 
tomatoes and wheat according to preliminary january figures by the 
agriculture department 
on the average prices that farmers got for raw products 
increased 14 percent from december to january the departments 
agricultural statistics board said tuesday 
as always there were losers as well as gainers with grapefruit 
oranges peanuts and strawberries commanding lower prices but even 
so the usdas overall price index was up 12 percent from a year 
earlier 
new quarterly figures showed prices paid by farmers to meet 
expenses rose 12 percent from october and averaged 61 percent more 
than a year ago higher prices for feeder stock including pigs and 
cattle along with higher calf prices accounted for most of the rise 
since last fall 
in a related report the board said preliminary figures showed 
last years corn production which was shriveled nearly a third by 
drought and heat had a value of more than 13 billion an average 
of 260 per bushel that was down from almost 14 billion in 1987 
when the crop averaged only 194 per bushel 
the value is usdas estimate of how much a crop is worth whether 
a farmer sells it for cash or feeds it to livestock 
soybeans were valued at almost 119 billion an average of 770 
per bushel compared with 113 billion and 588 in 1987 wheat was 
third at 663 billion and 370 per bushel compared with a 1987 
value of 55 billion and 257 per bushel 
according to the preliminary january price figures based mostly 
on midmonth averages the index for livestock and livestock products 
as a group rose 19 percent from their december average and was up 
68 percent from january 1988 
the departments allcrops price index for january rose 07 
percent from december and was up 20 percent from a year earlier 
prices of food grains were up 32 percent from december wheat 
prices rose 14 cents per bushel from december to 408 in january 
the highest since march 1981 rice dropped 8 cents per 100 pounds to 
652 per hundredweight 
prices of commercial vegetables rose 82 percent from december 
with tomatoes and sweet corn leading the increase 
the allfruit price index dropped 68 percent from december but 
still averaged 162 percent more than in january 1988 
oranges dropped to 620 per box from 650 in december but were 
up from 564 a year earlier grapefruit declined to 372 per box 
from 471 in december and 563 in january 1988 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 48 
billion to 58 billion this year compared with a nearrecord of 57 
billion in 1988 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise 
moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier 
production items 
food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 37 percent and 
usda analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is 
likely in 1989

washington ap an agriculture department survey shows that 
wind damage to land in the great plains is up sharply from the 
relatively moderate losses of a year ago mostly because of the 1988 
drought 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said tuesday nearly 22 million acres were reported damaged 
in november and december up more than 80 percent from 12 million 
acres in the same two months of 1987 
a lot of the damage is a result of drought scaling said 
the reasons vary by area but major factors are lack of crop 
residue and poor vegetative cover both caused by a lack of 
moisture 
scaling said more than 80 percent of the land reported damaged 
was cropland the remainder primarily rangeland 
texas accounted for more than 30 percent of the erosion damage in 
november and december with 664128 acres 
scaling said that in addition to the damaged land in november and 
december nearly 19 million acres were in condition to blow 
with five months still remaining in the critical wind season 
november and december are the first two months of an annual 
sevenmonth season when winds are highest and the soils are driest 
in the great plains surveys were made in 541 counties of the 
10state region 
although the 198788 season began with relatively light damage 
it picked up as moisture conditions worsened when the season ended 
last may 31 more than 13 million acres had been damaged the 
secondlargest acreage since scs began records in 1935 
the most widespread was in 1955 when about 16 million acres of 
great plains land were damaged by wind another bad year was 198081 
when 125 million acres were damaged 
according to the survey the statebystate breakdown comparing 
damaged acres in november and december with the damage during the 
same two months of 198788 included 
colorado 28795 acres damaged this season and 17070 in 198788 
kansas 135550 and 31520 
montana 510875 and 304023 
nebraska 54405 and 74590

the house will put off legislation tightening 
congressional control over covert intelligence actions and instead 
rely on the bush administrations good faith to keep lawmakers 
informed about such activity says speaker jim wright 
wright made the offer tuesday to bushs new secretary of state 
james a baker iii at a meeting designed to open doors to the 
administration and lay the groundwork for bipartisan cooperation on 
foreign policy 
in return wright said baker promised him that the administration 
will abide by the letter and the spirit of the law that requires 
the president to give congress timely notice of planned covert 
actions overseas 
that law has been a sore point in congressionaladministration 
relations especially since the irancontra affair when president 
reagan failed for more than 10 months to tell congress about arms 
sales to iran designed to win freedom for american hostages 
it was the intent of congress that timely should mean hours 
or days at most not weeks or months wright said 
legislation that grew out of congress irancontra investigation 
was introduced last year to erase the laws ambiguity over what 
constitutes timely notice by placing a firm 48hour notification 
requirement on the president 
the bills primary sponsor sen william cohen rmaine said he 
had no problem with wrights pledge so long as the white house 
voluntarily honors the 48hour standard in all but the most extreme 
circumstances where notice is impossible 
the senate passed the measure last year but it was pulled from 
the house calendar late in the year after wright ran into 
accusations that he had improperly publicly disclosed a covert cia 
operation in nicaragua 
a house ethics committee inquiry into wrights conduct remains 
open 
there is no point in opening old wounds if we can start afresh 
and act on a mutual assumption of good faith wright told 
reporters 
wright also set up a bipartisan task force to meet with baker and 
arrange regular consultation between the administration and congress 
on foreign policy matters trying to head off the confrontations 
that dogged relations between capitol hill and the reagan white 
house 
the task force he created includes house majority leader tom 
foley dwash foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell 
dfla judiciary committee chairman jack brooks dtexas and 
intelligence committee chairman anthony beilenson dcalif 
republican members are to be appointed by house minority leader 
robert michel rill 
their job will be to meet with baker periodically to find ways to 
build trust and overcome longstanding disputes with the executive 
branch including the circumstances under which us military forces 
will be deployed and the notification issue in covert operations 
cases wright said 
he said baker is seeking a mechanism by which the two branches 
can work out diputes over the war powers act and avoid the 
constitutional collision over congressional and white house 
authority that can occur when the president deploys us troops 
weve begun a process which may be constructive wright said 
one which he hopes will reduce the level of confrontation that has 
sometimes marred our relationships in the past couple of years

an unwed couple expecting their third 
child are creating children for the welfare rolls a federal 
judge said in blocking their request to overturn an agencys ban on 
housing unmarried couples 
us district judge ronald r lagueux also suggested that dana 
dagnese leave the family so that susan arsenau and the children 
could meet the woonsocket housing authoritys regulation said 
steven brown of the american civil liberties unions rhode island 
chapter 
the couple who have lived together six years filed a federal 
lawsuit two weeks ago saying the authoritys decision to deny them 
emergency housing violated their rights to freedom of association 
family privacy and equal protection of laws 
the couple were seeking a preliminary injuction tuesday no trial 
date has been set 
under our policy boyfriends are not allowed and they are not 
part of the family said ernest lafond the housing authoritys 
executive director 
the agencys attorney argued that the couple could neither show a 
husband and wife nor a commonlaw relationship said lafond 
but it was lagueux who said the relationship was adulterous and 
against the states public policy according to brown whose aclu 
chapter is assisting the couple 
here is a couple in an illicit relationship who are creating 
children for the welfare rolls while others who qualify for housing 
are shunted aside the judge said tuesday 
wouldnt the court look silly asking the authority to foster 
these people and allow them to continue an illegal relationship 
dagnese who has been separated from his wife for almost a 
decade is awaiting completion of his divorce brown said they have 
a 3yearold daughter and a yearold son and are expecting a child 
in march 
i have to tell my kids that this is not their father because 
were not married arsenau asked theyre still his kids and 
hes still their father 
theres no difference youre still together dagnese said 
the only difference is a piece of paper 
the couple was ordered to leave their rented apartment dec 15 
because of safety hazards in the building said brown the agency 
denied them emergency shelter soon thereafter 
arsenau had the opportunity to request an informal hearing to 
discuss the situation or to complain to a formal grievance panel 
after her application was rejected but did neither the housing 
agency director said 
arsenau who is bedridden because of her pregnancy testified she 
and the children have been sleeping in the living room of a friends 
apartment dagnese who recently lost his job with a dairy company 
usually sleeps in his car or with other friends she said

several major campaign promises by president 
bush are likely to be missing or significantly scaled back in the 
budget proposal he will make to congress next week administration 
officials say 
campaign pledges for a major expansion of medicaid and increased 
funding for several education programs are among those likely to 
fall victim to concern about the federal deficit said the 
officials who spoke tuesday on condition of anonymity 
bush does plan to propose several tax breaks the officials said 
but the scope of a proposed capitalgains rate cut remains undecided 
bush has long advocated a reduction in the capital gains tax 
the tax on profits from the sale of homes stocks and other assets 
to a maximum of 15 percent but senior aides said treasury officials 
are having a hard time coming up with a formula and the final 
proposal could call for lower rates for one category than for 
another 
bush campaign promises on education including a 500 million 
national merit scholarship program an expansion of the head start 
program and a 50 million increase in school experimentation may be 
pruned back considerably the officials said 
they also said bushs campaign proposal to expand medicaid 
coverage to more lowerincome americans and to allow lowpaid 
workers to purchase it is being given a low priority in budget 
preparation talks 
budget constraints make fulfillment of such promises unlikely 
the officials said 
the two have to be reconciled said a senior white house 
official who insisted upon anonymity 
bush has promised to propose a budget that does not contain a tax 
increase while meeting the grammrudman law requirement for reducing 
the deficit to 100 billion or less 
the officials said that bushs budget to be unveiled feb 9 when 
he addresses a joint session of congress will include these 
proposals 
a childcare tax credit of up to 1000 per child for lowincome 
families generally those earning less than 10000 a year 
new tax incentives for oil and gas exploration likely coupled 
with a call for removal of all remaining price controls on natural 
gas now affecting about 40 percent of production 
a proposal for taxfree enterprise zones to be established 
in some inner city areas to promote commercial growth a program 
championed by bushs nominee for housing and urban development 
secretary jack kemp 
administration officials are still wrestling with terms of a 
package to help bail out troubled savings and loans and it appeared 
likely that some variation on a proposal for an increased fee for 
deposit insurance would be part of the new bush budget plan 
bush himself has said that a proposal for a reduced capitalgains 
tax rate will be part of his feb 9 rewrite of the 115 trillion 
budget president reagan submitted last month for fiscal 1990 
however sources say there is still disagreement over exactly 
what form the tax cut should take 
bush and other advocates of a lower capital gains tax say it 
would boost the economy by increasing business investment opponents 
say it would be a tax break for the rich that also would worsen the 
federal deficit 
capital gains are currently taxed at the same level as other 
income at 15 percent 28 percent or 33 percent depending on 
overall income bush would like to lower the rate to a flat 15 
percent 
bush claims that instead of costing the government money such a 
move would spur investment and generate up to 4 billion a year in 
new revenue 
however many leading economists including the bipartisan 
congressional budget office say lowering the tax would have the 
opposite effect reducing revenues and further worsening the 
deficit 
thats because some capital gains such as the profits raised 
from the sale of private homes or objects of art are unlikely to 
be funneled into business investment 
under existing law homeowners can generally escape the capital 
gains tax by plowing their profits into another home and there is a 
onetime exemption from the tax for homeowners over age 55

a fathers memory of being worried sick about 
his injured son but too poor to pay the hospital bill inspired a 
newspaper column that has raised millions of dollars over the past 
40 years to help care for needy youngsters 
the father and the columnist was bill gold of the washington 
post he is now 76 and retired missing one kidney and forbidden to 
smoke his beloved cigars after openheart surgery god i miss 
em he says 
but gold still likes to tell funny stories and he still 
cherishes his favorite charity 
he and bob levey who succeeded gold in writing the daily column 
eight years ago were hosts at a thankyou party tuesday night for 
some of the thousands of readers who answered their appeals for 
donations to childrens hospital over the years 
among the guests was bonnie biermann of suburban alexandria va 
who spent five months in the hospital in 196465 as a 13yearold 
undergoing extensive brain surgery 
bonnie who is confined to a wheelchair recently mailed levey a 
7 check which i hope will help in a small way 
also at the party was john reed 8 who will undergo his 15th 
operation at childrens next monday for multiple birth defects 
weve spent our life savings on surgery said his mother dianna 
reed of silver spring md if we ever get him through this well 
contribute freely 
officials at childrens hospital say the private nonprofit 
facility in northeast washington provides 25 million in free 
medical care each year to children whose parents are too poor to pay 
the full costs of treatment 
without 45 million in voluntary donations last year officials 
said the hospital would have shown a deficit 
golds column the district line a chronicle of hometown 
happenings that never make page one first appeared in the post on 
jan 13 1947 not long afterward a woman wrote to advertise some 
giveaway pets and enclosed a dollar for your favorite charity 
gold searched the city for a worthy cause he said he was 
impressed by childrens hospital partly because it was chartered in 
1860 before the civil war to provide medical care for indigent 
children of every race and creed 
gold said he recalled an earlier time when he was the hungry 
young news director of a cincinnati radio station and rushed his 
2yearold son to the local childrens hospital it was so 
dilapidated it had been condemned by the fire marshal he said 
standing in the similar disrepair of childrens hospital 40 years 
ago gold said it was very easy to remember when i didnt have 
two quarters to rub together and was afraid my kid had a fractured 
skull it made me feel that this is where i belong 
the column has raised some 6 million for the hospital since then 
looking back gold said hed make the same choice today 
i know of no other place where they take the child first make 
sure hes cared for and then ask the parents whether they can 
pay he said 
although hes on everybodys sucker list and must turn down 
some charitable appeals gold said its very difficult to say i 
need this money more than childrens hospital anyone who cant 
respond to the needs of sick children is a pretty sad character

authorities have discovered the bodies 
of six people who were shot in the head with a shotgun near a 
trailer compound and one of the residents has been charged with two 
of the deaths 
the body of a man found tuesday in the rusted hull of a car in a 
junkyard near the threetrailer compound appeared to have been shot 
twice in the back of the head at close range said assistant state 
medical examiner dr vasudeo kshirsagar 
the condition of the body indicated that the victim had been dead 
several months kshirsagar said adding that the five others 
appeared to have been killed in a similar manner 
it was a shotgun it was consistent with the other cases 
said kanawha county sheriff art ashley 
police believe the body is that of 20yearold michael schillings 
of north carolina who came to the compound to live last spring and 
was reported missing last summer 
on monday the body of 22yearold jimmy price was found on the 
site about 30 feet from the car authorities said the junkyard is 
about 200 yards east of the compound where the first two bodies 
were discovered jan 8 
if all six bodies are linked to the same killer it would be the 
worst series of deaths in west virginia attributed to the same 
person 
authorities said 19yearold mark southern mccallister is being 
held without bond on charges of murdering brothers billy and otis 
sanson who lived with mccallister at the compound in st albans a 
town of 15000 people 15 miles west of charleston 
prosecutors said mccallister has confessed to the brothers 
murders 
police found the body of the sansons sister bonnie pauley at 
an abandoned motel across the street from the compound on jan 21 
another victim mccallisters grandmother charlotte farrell 69 
was found in her nearby home 
we hope this ight wrap up the investigation from the standpoint 
of looking for people ashley said 
the sheriffs department declined to say whether mccallister 
would be charged in the other deaths or to speculate on a motive 
however authorities said all the victims lived at the compound 
which is now abandoned and price and schillings had dated bonnie 
pauley

president bush is naming undersecretary of 
state michael h armacost the new us ambassador to japan where he 
will grapple with touchy trade and defense issues 
armacost 51 is the highestranking foreign service officer in 
the state department if confirmed by the senate he will succeed 
mike mansfield a former senate democratic leader who was the 
ambassador for a record 11 years before retiring last november at 
age 85 
bushs selection of armacost was confirmed tuesday by a us 
official who declined to be identified after reports of the pending 
nomination circulated in japan 
three other diplomatic selections also surfaced bernard aronson 
for the sensitive job of assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs richard t mccormack to be undersecretary of 
state for economic affairs and john negroponte to be us ambassador 
to mexico 
aronson is a democrat who broke with the majority of his party to 
support us aid to the nicaraguan rebels mccormack is currently 
assigned to the interamerican bureau negroponte deputy national 
security adviser was a candidate to succeed armacost 
armacost is a former us ambassador to the philippines and was 
the ranking asian specialist on the national security council staff 
in 19781979 during the carter administration 
he has held a pentagon post as well serving as deputy assistant 
secretary of defense in 197980 
us relations with tokyo are at a crucial stage with pressure 
building in congress to have the japanese increase their 
contribution to the countrys defense another problem in the 
relationship is the us trade deficit of 57 billion caused by an 
influx of japanese products 
under former secretary of state george p shultz armacost played 
a key role in dealing with soviet authorities on regional disputes 
in afghanistan southwest africa cambodia and central america 
and armacost in a memorandum to shultz on july 2 1986 
counseled him to oppose former president reagans surreptitious plan 
to send us missiles to iran in an effort to free american hostages 
this seems scarcely a propitious moment to send arms to teheran 
and it has never been clear the iranians we are dealing with are 
going to possess any clout in a postkhomeini iran armacost wrote 
an imposing 6footer armacost has a quiet demeanor and lowkey 
style 
twenty years ago he served in tokyo as a visiting professor of 
international relations at the international christian university 
and from 1972 to 1974 he was a special assistant in the us embassy 
there 
armacost is a graduate of carleton college and columbia 
university he is married and has three children 
he is expected to be succeeded in the job of undersecretary of 
state for political affairs by robert kimmet a washington lawyer 
bush is breaking precedent by not naming a career diplomat to the 
no 3 job at the state department but lawrence eagleburger a 
former foreign service officer with 37 years experience is to be 
nominated deputy secretary of state 
mccormack is a former ambassador to the organization of american 
states and has politically conservative views 
aronson on the other hand is a democrat who shifted from 
skepticism about us support for the contra rebels to supporting 
the reagan administrations program 
a democratic senate source who spoke only on condition of 
anonymity said the choice had been made because aronson was a 
moderate who could appeal to both democrats and republicans on 
divisive central american policies and nicaragua in particular 
aronson would succeed elliott abrams in the post abrams was an 
ardent champion of the contras who clashed with democrats in 
congress over what many considered to be misleading testimony about 
the secret us program to finance the nicaraguan rebels with funds 
solicited from foreign governments 
meanwhile a white house source said bush was expected to name 
negroponte ambassador to mexico negroponte a former ambassador to 
honduras also has served in a variety of foreign posts including 
in hong kong vietnam and ecuador

turks and germans nod politely to each other on the 
streets of west berlins predominantly turkish neighborhood but a 
current of mistrust sometimes runs beneath the outer friendliness 
that uneasiness seems to have intensified now that a farright 
party which suggests foreigners do not belong in west germany has 
won seats in the citys legislature its first electoral victory on 
the state level 
turks and other nongermans living in this city are worried by 
the republicans sudden emergence as a serious political party 
the republicans did not win so many seats in the legislature 
but we are very concerned they could become stronger in the 
future said zafer oeztuerk a university student from turkey 
west berlin has a reputation for a liberal attitude toward the 
nongermans who stream into the city and many berliners took to the 
streets to express dismay after the republicans captured 75 percent 
of sundays vote or 11 of the legislatures 134 seats 
an estimated 15000 people protested outside city hall on monday 
demanding the outlawing of the 5yearold party whose national 
chairman is former nazi ss soldier franz schoenhuber 
many conservative west berliners however say they have nothing 
against foreigners but believe it unfair to give nongermans jobs 
and apartments when the city has a housing shortage and 11 percent 
unemployment 
analysts think the republicans were able to pick up so many votes 
because the governing christian democrats have failed to address 
their conservative constituents concerns about the growing number 
of foreigners mostly turks who are competing with germans for 
jobs housing and social services 
it appears that the vote for the republicans was more of a 
protest vote richard stoess a political scientist at west 
berlins free university told the berlin morgenpost newspaper 
an estimated 262000 foreigners live in west berlin a city of 2 
million residents surrounded by east germany more than half are 
turks 
many of the turks live in southeast 36 a section of the huge 
workingclass kreuzberg district that a visitor might mistake for 
istanbul if not for the german cars and tavern signs advertising 
local beers 
women draped in traditional shawls ply the sidewalk outside drab 
shops and ethnic food stores bantering with clerks and customers in 
turkish 
turks who live in west berlin say they were shocked when they 
heard the republicans had won seats in the legislature and angrily 
defend their right to live in the city 
we couldnt believe this happened said tuncay yueksel who 
runs a turkish bakery i am a german and so are my wife and 
children we belong here he said in fluent german 
yueksel said germans and turks live alongside each other in 
southeast 36 and get along well a feeling echoed by a german man at 
a neighborhood cafe 
but a middleaged german grocer said there are too many 
foreigners 
she said she had voted for the republicans 
this neighborhood was once all german but they started moving 
out when turks started moving in weve become foreigners here in 
our own neighborhood she said 
look i am certainly not a nazi and the republicans are not 
nazis either i was only a child when hitler was in power but i 
know those were bad times said the woman 
but the republicans were saying the right things its not 
right when foreigners collect social assistance that we provide with 
our taxes 
the woman refused to give her name saying that could be bad 
for my business 
the election has unified west berlins nongermans 
i think its really odd that so many conservative germans 
travel to turkey for their vacations get their suntans and then 
return home saying the turks have to go said abdel nasser assal 
a young egyptian taxi driver 
he also rejected suggestions that foreigners are stealing jobs 
from germans 
the foreigners who come here have to take jobs the germans 
dont want said assal its rare that you find germans lining 
up for work as maids dishwashers and domestic servants those jobs 
are left to the foreigners

the soviet union is trying to finance its 
reforms with loans from the west while postponing tough decisions 
needed at home to curb its budget deficit says the author of a new 
book on the soviet economy 
author judy shelton has joined a chorus of skeptics including 
many on capitol hill who worry that western banks and governments 
are extending credits to the kremlin without reviewing the strategic 
implications 
sheltons new book the coming soviet crash gorbachevs 
desperate pursuit of credit in western financial markets includes 
a detailed analysis of published soviet budget data 
she concluded that kremlin accountants have been fudging the 
countrys economic figures for years steadily reporting budget 
surpluses when in fact there were growing deficits the soviets 
finally admitted to a budget deficit last october 
the foremost spokesman in congress on the issue sen bill 
bradley dnj has cautioned that giving the kremlin easy credits 
could undercut us interests and harm rather than help the reforms 
of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
nevertheless said shelton under gorbachev the soviets have 
turned increasingly to the west for financing 
as part of the reforms the soviets are publishing many 
previously secret economic statistics but shelton and others 
question the data 
one respected soviet economist for example has said the deficit 
is three times higher than the kremlin has acknowledged 
last august in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue 
the soviet government said it had a budget surplus putting the 
figure at 3 billion rubles or 18 billion 
it was revealed three months later that the soviets had been 
running a deficit for years shelton said the revelation she 
said did not prompt a protest from the swiss bank that sponsored 
the loan or from those who bought the issue 
the continued cloudiness of soviet financial figures does not 
augur well for the west as the soviets seek to join such western 
financial institutions as the international monetary fund world 
bank and the general agreement on trade and tariffs which require 
transparent reporting in which no numbers are hidden shelton 
said 
gorbachevs onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left 
the united states dazed sh wrote 
although the soviet union has increased its international 
borrowing the credits do not come close to covering the deficit 
meaning that the kremlin has simply printed more money to cover the 
gap 
prices remain under government control however disguising or at 
least postponing an inflationary spiral 
and shelton said in a capitol hill presentation this week 
gorbachev has not taken one of the major promised steps of his 
perestroika campaign to restructure the soviet economy a price 
reform that would eliminate subsidies on many commodities 
for the west the greatest concern is that the soviets are 
borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at 
home 
the correlation between gorbachevs reign in the kremlin and 
the escalation of soviet borrowing activities in western financial 
markets is striking wrote shelton a researcher at the hoover 
institution of stanford university 
within two years after gorbachev took power in march 1985 
soviet debt to the west shot up from about 25 billion to over 37 
billion an increase of 50 percent she wrote 
bradley in a new york times column on jan 6 cautioned that 
the notion that western governments can help mr gorbachev through 
cheap credit is flawed 
reform means making tough choices butter not weapons 
efficiency not useless output consumption not forced saving the 
real reformers know this they also know it means higher prices 
less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise 
of a better life tomorrow bradley said 
continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the 
soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life 
soviet finance minister boris i gostev last october estimated 
the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles about 58 billion at 
current exchange rates 
another wellknown soviet economist leonid abalkin last week 
said that the actual deficit was nearly three times gostevs 
estimate about 165 billion or 11 percent of the gross national 
product by comparison the us government deficit runs at about 4 
percent of gnp 
other soviet officials have been more optimistic mikhail 
korolev chairman of the state committee for statistics wrote in 
pravda on monday that the gnp grew 5 percent last year and was 133 
percent higher than in 1985 
the government announced this month that soviet gnp in 1988 
totaled 866 billion rubles or 14 trillion that was less than 
half of the 1985 us gnp of 38 trillion

an american ballet premier scheduled for the 
third night of the feld ballets jan 31 to march 12 season was 
pushed up to opening night because of an injury to a dancer 
so the joyce theater audience on tuesday saw petipa 
notwithstanding choreographed by eliot feld to composer terry 
rileys 1964 in c 
the minimalist music set the dancers to relentless motion and had 
a physical effect on this viewer too the throat closed and nails 
were chewed stages of viewing went from admiration for the dancers 
skill and stamina to a wish for it to end 
the dancers in white leotards with black lines and dots didnt 
look like people to a steady 44 beat they began moving across the 
stage heads dangling forward like rag dolls the music changed to 
clangclang first heard over bells then over a drone and the 
dancers reached up and out to draw air toward themselves like 
robots on a fantasy assembly line 
the choreography followed the music when the beat was fast the 
dancers were frantic but even when the men were jumping up in 
unison and scrabbling under their armpits there was something 
static about the whole thing 
marius petipa choreographer of the sleeping beauty 
mentioned in the title is considered the originator of classical 
ballet 
arts need to move forward and modern music must surely inspire 
choreographers in new directions this viewer who found petipa 
notwithstanding neither attractive nor exciting isnt 
appreciating this new direction yet 
thomas lemanski one of six dancers scheduled for intermezzo 
no 1 sustained a lower back injury causing that dance to be 
replaced 
the evening began with felds 1970 the consort it begins in 
a courtly way and moves into earthier peasant fare the women tuck 
up their skirts the men change fitted jackets for homespun and toss 
the women in the air and down in a dance that becomes quite sexy 
just before the curtain falls it ended with felds 1986 skara 
brae set to traditional scottish irish and breton airs 
following its season at the joyce theater the feld ballet 
company will perform in providence ri storrs conn hempstead 
ny lyndon vt durham nh orono maine easton pa and san 
diego

a bipartisan federal commission that must come 
up with ways to cut the governments 150billionayear deficits is 
finding agreement out of its grasp even with the deadline for 
producing a final report just four weeks away 
members of the national economic commission which met tuesday 
indicated that republicans were differing over a draft proposal some 
of their members were circulating and that democrats might end up 
filing their own report 
i think its going to be very hard for us to agree on anything 
without going to jail said rep bill frenzel rminn a 
commission member and ranking gop lawmaker on the house budget 
committee 
frenzel was referring to a court ruling issued earlier this month 
that ordered the 14member commission to hold its sessions in 
public many panel members have complained that without closeddoor 
meetings it has become hard to discuss politically touchy subjects 
such as new taxes or spending cuts 
former rep thomas ashley dohio appointed to the commission by 
president bush said republican staff aides had composed a plan that 
embraced bushs flexible freeze limiting spending increases to the 
rate of inflation while requiring no new taxes he would not discuss 
the specific program changes advanced in the plan 
ashley said he liked the idea and drew lewis the republican 
cochairman of the panel predicted that ultimately ashley and the 
panels seven republicans would support the flexible freeze as 
drawn up by the president 
others said no such majority consensus was in sight panel member 
sen pete domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the senate 
budget committee told reporters the implication that republicans 
are unanimously behind something i dont think is true and robert 
strauss the democratic lawyer who cochairs the commission with 
lewis said there are substantial differences among republicans 
lewis also said a minority on the panel might put out a 
dissenting report 
i would think theres a good chance that might be the case 
strauss said after tuesdays meeting 
the views expressed tuesday made it seem ever less likely that 
the panel created in late 1987 to find a bipartisan longrange 
solution to the governments colossal red ink problem would 
accomplish its goal 
tuesdays hourlong session focused on the nations savings and 
loan crisis and on the multibillion dollar surpluses built up each 
year for future social security benefits critics say the social 
security surpluses are making the deficit appear smaller than it 
really is 
earlier this month treasury secretary nicholas brady told the 
commission to have its report ready by march 1 rather than six 
months later as the law establishing the panel would have allowed 
bush advanced his flexible freeze plan during the presidential 
election campaign under the proposal overall federal spending 
increases would be held to the rate of inflation with increases in 
some programs and reductions in others with the booming economy 
bush predicts government revenues would grow at an even faster rate 
and the budget would be balanced in a few years without tax 
increases he has said 
critics have argued that bushs expectations for the economy are 
too optimistic and chided him for not mentioning specifically which 
programs would face cuts

if the latest exhibit at the steinhart 
aquarium looks like a fish out of water thats exactly what it is 
a frozen shark 
the great white shark 1500 pounds and 13 feet long was 
caught off the golden gate bridge last fall by fisherman michael 
mchenry 
he must have used a huge hook aquarium director john 
mccosker said tuesday its in there somewhere 
mccosker said great white sharks have rarely been kept alive in 
captivity for more than a few hours because they have to swim to 
breathe 
but hes confident that someday the aquariums tanks will contain 
a live shark until then the steinharts new exhibit is a good 
and safe way to get a close look at one

afghan rebels are likely to lay siege to kabul 
after the last soviet troops quit afghanistan and could bring the 
promoscow government down within weeks a state department official 
says 
the choke em tactics are designed to force the citys 
defenders to surrender or to defect once their soviet military 
support is gone the official said tuesday 
in the past few weeks the soviets have bombed rebel positions 
throughout the country partly in an attempt to keep the mujahedeen 
dispersed and to protect a continuing convoy of food and fuel 
supplies to kabul 
when the last soviet soldier steps across the border they know 
in their heart of hearts its going to unravel said the official 
who spoke only on condition he would not be identified 
kabul already burdened by more than 1 million refugees from the 
provinces has only enough fuel and food to last for a few days the 
official said 
the rebels who will continue to receive us arms through 
pakistan plan to keep tightening the noose around kabul and 
other urban centers using a siege magnified strategy the 
official said 
the aim is to try to persuade the citys defenders to surrender 
or to defect but many of them are of the hardcore type 
including members of the afghan secret police and will stay and 
fight because there is little chance of amnesty the official said 
so it will be difficult he said the crystal ball is 
murky at one time we were talking of them lasting 6 to 12 months 
and then 3 to 6 months estimates vary but its going to be sooner 
rather than later 
if that strangle effect works and i see no reason why it 
should not the government could unravel very quickly in a matter 
of weeks not months 
the soviet troops are departing under a feb 15 deadline set in 
the geneva accords of last april the state department on monday 
accused the soviets of engaging in a scorched earth policy of 
bombing rebel positions as the red army exits 
the official said the soviets claim to be retaliating for a rebel 
blockade of food and fuel convoys but were bombing positions as far 
away as 30 miles to the east of the main supply route 
so far as we can tell the resistance has been fairly 
restrained about interfering with supplies he said there has 
been some interdiction but not to the extent that the soviets 
suggest 
however the official said the interference is going to grow 
if they dont quit this stupidity 
he said one aim of the bombing missile and artillery attacks is 
to punish ahmed shah massoud a rebel leader in the panjsher valley 
east of kabul who has refused to promise not to interdict food and 
fuel shipments to the capital 
most of the mujahedeen leaders agreed last november under us 
pressure to permit the soviets to depart without interference 
by taking this bombing action the soviets run the risk of the 
resistance not letting them withdraw more or less in peace the 
official said 
with tensions rising the us embassy in kabul closed on monday 
and the remaining diplomats and security guards were flown out of 
the country 
one reason he said was to prevent afghan officials from seeking 
asylum there as political refugees on the other hand the state 
department and the us immigration and naturalization service are 
consider an application from former deputy foreign minister abdul 
ghaffar lakanwal who defected last november on a trip to new york 
last week the official said the state department sent a formal 
note to us embassies in europe the middle east and south asia 
instructing them to deny visas to anyone attached to the promoscow 
government of president najibullah

an argentine supply ship that ran 
aground off antarctica sank tuesday in heavy seas and high winds 
the government said and there was concern oil in its hold could 
leak and damage the environment 
the sinking of the 400foot bahia paraiso followed warnings from 
the us national science foundation that the unspoiled antarctic 
could face ecological disaster if the 250000 gallons of diesel fuel 
aboard the ship were to spill 
no injuries were reported in the sinking tourists aboard and the 
crew had been evacuated from the vessel which was 600 miles south 
of cape horn the tip of south america salvage efforts had been 
hampered by 50 mph winds 
the doublehulled oceanographic ship sank at about 10 pm the 
government news agency telam said citing a navy communique telam 
did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when 
it went down 
the depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately 
known 
the ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline 
and canisters of compressed gases to the argentine esperanza station 
near the tip of the antarctic peninsula the national science 
foundation said in a statement released in washington 
the ship ran aground saturday about two miles from palmer 
station a us research facility on the antarctic peninsula the 
continents tip it sustained a 35footlong gash in its hull and 
some of the 250000 gallons of diesel fuel began leaking washing 
ashore near palmer station 
the fuel killed some krill a tiny shrimplike creature that is a 
vital part of the antarctic food chain and has affected penguins 
sea gulls and giant petrel birds the national science foundation 
statement said 
there were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the 
wildlife in the pristine surroundings 
agency spokesman jack renerie said tuesday before the ship sank 
that the leak which was threatening penguins and other wildlife 
had stopped 
scientists are concerned that some research search projects may 
already have been affected by the leak a foundation statement 
said it said two argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive 
thursday or friday 
before the sinking argentine officials had discounted a spill 
telam quoted argentine navy sources as saying the fuel it 
carried both for itself and the antarctic stations was in steel 
drums so a spill is practically impossible 
the 316 people aboard the ship when it ran aground including 82 
passengers and 234 crew members were rescued by power boats and 
taken to palmer station 
the passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to 
the south shetland islands from which they were airlifted to the 
south american mainland sunday but 104 crewmen remain at the 
station said renerie 
because the station is equipped for only 40 people food has been 
rationed to two meals a day a national science foundation statement 
said

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
planning a fastpaced swing to possibly more than a dozen nato 
capitals this month in an attempt to strengthen contacts in the 
beleaguered alliance 
state department spokesman charles redman described the tour on 
tuesday as as a very complicated arrangement that could take the 
new secretary to 14 cities in five days 
it would be bakers debut tour abroad as president bushs chief 
adviser on foreign affairs 
the visit comes as tensions are rising within the alliance on 
developing a response to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
disarmament overtures and the military cutbacks announced by his 
warsaw pact allies 
another major issue is the dispute over the us contribution to 
the alliance and pressure for europeans members to pick up more of 
their own defense costs 
recent surveys have shown gorbachevs socalled charm 
offensive to be highly effective in western europe with fewer 
citizens there viewing the 40yearold alliance as necessary in 
light of the soviet leaders public relations offensive 
redman said baker intends to meet with as many of his nato 
colleagues as possible and wants to do so in each of the foreign 
ministers home capitals because the new secretary attaches a very 
high priority to the sessions 
redman noted that baker is scheduled to accompany president bush 
to canada for a daylong meeting on feb 10 as well as to japan for 
the feb 24 funeral of emperor hirohito and the oneday visits that 
weekend to china and korea 
baker intends to sandwich the european tour between the canada

she had come thousands of miles and 
her journey was nearly over one last barrier separated the young 
asian woman from her husband in the united states 
but the niagara river was too swift and too cold too great an 
obstacle for a small woman in a flimsy rubber raft and she died in 
its icy waters on jan 5 as many as four others may have died with 
her 
the tragedy below niagara falls has provided shocking testimony 
to what federal immigration officials have long known that the 
swift 40milelong river between canada and the united states has 
become a northern crossing point for growing numbers of illegal 
aliens 
little is known about the young drowning victim whose body was 
found in the river near the town of lewiston investigators have 
determined that she was in her 30s carried two suitcases and a 
passport that did not belong to her and had come from a small town 
in malaysia 
like many others authorities said she apparently entrusted her 
fate to a smuggling ring that brought her to toronto and then was 
to bring her to her husband in new york city 
benedict ferro regional director of the federal immigration and 
naturalization service said his agents have identified half a dozen 
organized rings involved in smuggling people across the border one 
ring is thought to have brought in more than 250 chinese last year 
police in lewiston caught five chinese immigrants last summer who 
apparently had crossed the border in a rubber raft 
when you have a group of wet chinese walking around the streets 
of lewiston youre going to attract some attention said dennis 
peruzzini head of an ins antismuggling unit 
peruzzini said the aliens were natives of fukien province in 
china who had made their way from hong kong to vancouver british 
columbia toronto and then niagara falls with the aid of a new 
yorkbased smuggling ring 
their destination was new york citys chinatown where they would 
have tried to find work as laborers he said 
ferro said the leaders of the smuggling rings called arrangers 
are usually based in new york city and sometimes smuggle drugs or 
other contraband the arrangers have an elaborate system of contacts 
in cities in several countries 
you just dont tell a person in hong kong to buy a plane ticket 
and leave it at that ferro said 
the arranger will provide false passports escorts safe houses 
in toronto the means of getting across the border the methods 
vary aliens sometimes are squeezed into the trunks of cars or false 
compartments in tractortrailers inched across the towering 
superstructures of bridges or put in flimsy boats 
fees of more than 2000 per alien make it a lucrative business 
ferro said 
ferro described aliens transported illegally across the border as 
victims of the smugglers they dont realize the risks involved 
they are simply being preyed upon because of their desire to improve 
their economic situation he said 
unlike many illegal mexican immigrants who cross the rio grande 
with the intention of returning home those crossing the turbulent 
niagara channel want to stay in the united states permanently 
officials said 
but for the fact they cant qualify for an immigration visa 
these people pretty much fit the mold of legal immigrants in years 
past ferro said 
for the most part they are honest hardworking people whose 
only desire is to better themselves he said if given the 
opportunity theyd probably make great americans 
the niagara county sheriffs department is continuing a search of 
the river for the bodies of any other passengers in the raft that 
held the young malaysian woman 
authorities dont hold out much hope for finding any bodies until 
spring when the ice covering the shoreline melts 
nor do officials expect to hear from the young womans husband 
who risks deportation if he steps forward to retrieve his wifes 
body authorities are trying to locate her family in malaysia so the 
body can be returned home

nasa says it probably will have to 
replace at least two suspect turbopumps whose failure could touch 
off a fatal explosion aboard discovery and the repairs could delay 
the shuttles liftoff indefinitely 
shuttle managers scheduled a late afternoon meeting today to 
discuss the three turbopumps which became questionable when nasa 
discovered tiny cracks in one of atlantis pumps following that 
shuttles december flight 
the space agency had been aiming for a feb 23 liftoff but a 
series of technical delays not related to the pumps has erased that 
date the agency said it doesnt have a new date 
the technical problems have postponed discoverys rollout to the 
launch pad originally set for jan 26 a total of eight days with 
the move now set for friday 
officials said engineers are likely to replace at least two of 
discoverys three turbopumps delaying the launch for weeks or 
months if new pumps have to be installed nasa must decide whether 
it can roll discovery to the pad and do the work there along with 
other operations 
postflight inspection of atlantis engines disclosed two tiny 
cracks in a bearing assembly in one of three highpressure liquid 
oxygen turbopumps 
engineers believe they were caused by stress corrosion resulting 
from moisture trapped inside the bearing during the manufacturing 
process but they are uncertain how the moisture penetrated the 
metal 
officials became concerned when they found that two of 
discoverys turbopumps underwent the same manufacturing process as 
the cracked one 
the turbopump which transforms the shuttles liquid oxygen 
propellant into gas operates at extremely high temperatures and 
speeds and its failure could set off an explosion that could 
destroy the spaceship the cracks on atlantis were too small to 
cause trouble but if such cracks widened and split the bearing 
assembly it could be dangerous national aeronautics and space 
administration officials said 
in the past turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle is 
horizontal in a processing hangar but discovery is vertical 
attached to its solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel tank 
technicians have been rehearsing procedures for the more 
difficult vertical replacement officials believe replacing two 
turbopumps would take at least two weeks and that replacement of 
all three could delay the launch indefinitely 
if the launch is delayed too long it would affect the next 
atlantis mission which is to dispatch the magellan probe to venus 
after a liftoff scheduled april 28 discovery would have to be off 
the only shuttle launch pad by about march 14 if the april date is 
to be maintained 
nasa has given atlantis and magellan priority over the 
communications satellite in discoverys cargo bay so if the 
discovery launch slips too much it will be put off until later in 
the year 
thats because there is only a 25day period starting april 28 
when venus will be in position to receive a probe from earth after 
that period expires it will be two more years before the planet 
will be aligned properly with earth

joyce cowfer was in tears when she called pat 
hennin with the news that shed miscalcuated the size of her 
foundation and realized it would cost nearly 1000 more to build 
her maryland home 
not to worry said hennin coowner of the shelter institute and 
cowfers former instructor he consoled her patiently explained how 
to correct her blunder and even drew diagrams and mailed them to her 
within a few months she was done three bedrooms two baths 
passive solar heat and a jacuzzi and all for 55000 about 
onethird market value 
they not only give you the information they give you the 
confidence cowfer said you dont need building experience 
for 15 years hennin his wife patsy and several other 
instructors have taught students how to tackle the forbidding task 
of building a home at less than half the cost of buying the 
finished home or hiring someone to build it 
people who build their own homes are more satisfied hennin said 
less hurried than a contractor the doityourselfer will examine 
every aspect of the building process and make carefully considered 
decisions 
contractors dont shop around and generally do not match 
solutions to specific problems he said the contractor simply 
does it this way because thats the way theyve always done it 
more than 14000 students from around the world including 
novices who barely knew which end of the hammer to hold have 
attended the school located in a 120yearold brick building in this 
coastal town north of portland the students range in age from 18 to 
70 and have included lumberjacks doctors madison avenue 
executives carpenters engineers and architects 
students can choose the 15week onedayaweek session for 450 
per person or 725 per couple or opt for compressed sessions of two 
or three weeks for slightly more money classes are limited to 40 
students 
all students learn how to survey a lot pour a foundation design 
and build every inch of a house they also receive instruction in 
the concept of heat the physics of materials engineering framing 
and financing 
the information was presented in such a way that it was 
nonintimidating said gary miers 34 who is spending 50000 to 
build a house valued at 140000 in raymond it was presented in a 
relaxed fashion 
mistakes arent ruinous hennin said because there isnt 
anything in a house that isnt forgiving 
thats comforting for students who also quickly learn that the 
mistakes they make are much less costly than if a contractor were 
building the house 
when a contractor walks into a store he doesnt ask what the 
price is he just assumes hes getting the wholesale cost but the 
price may be lower elsewhere hennin said contractors dont shop 
around 
for example a shelter institute student can make insulated glass 
windows for about 3 per square foot whereas a contractor is likely 
to pay 10 hennin said all the lumber to build a house rarely 
would be over 4000 he added 
the hennins both 45 began their business in 1974 hennin who 
had just finished law school and had some prior building experience 
was hired to help build a house for a friend soon he had other 
offers to build and his wifes interest in home construction 
surfaced 
we had a choice of building houses for the rest of our lives or 
getting involved in another way teaching people mrs hennin 
said 
housing styles have changed over the last 15 years after the 
simple boxstyle homes that marked the days of energy conservation 
and the backtotheearth movement of the early and mid1970s 
underground homes became popular those now have been replaced by 
elaborate designs more reflective of the 1980s prosperity 
sophistication and selfindulgence mrs hennin said 
jim and roxie westbrook of santa cruz calif are building a 
passivesolar country house on the outskirts of the nearby henry 
cowell redwoods state park complete with a hot tub and more gadgets 
and fixtures than they had in the older homes they owned 
theres nothing cheap in it mrs westbrook said in a 
telephone interview when its a choice between quality and going 
for quality we go for quality 
others prefer a home that is unadorned miers and his wife left 
pennsylvania with the romantic notion of building a home that 
embraced their 1960s values the desire to be independent 
energyefficient and frugal 
but despite changing tastes mrs hennin says most people are 
joined by a creative urge and a determination to take control of 
their lives 
its a grabbing of life rather than letting life roll you 
over she said if houses cost so much its your responsibility 
to figure out a way for them not to cost so much

some 30 years ago an explosive drama by a unknown 
young black woman defied the odds the experts and the money men to 
open on broadway 
lorraine hansberrys a raisin in the sun which starred 
sidney poitier went on to win critical raves and stablished itself 
as a cornerstone in amnerican theater 
while the story of a black chicago familys move from the ghetto 
into a white neighborhood has been produced thousands of times and 
has captivated millions of theater patrons and moviegoers worldwide 
hansberrys original play has never been seen in its entirety 
however a new uncut production will be broadcast by pbs on feb 
1 it stars danny glover and esther rolle it is the years first 
production in the american playhouse now in its eighth season 
the new production will include nearly an hours worth of 
restored material including themes of feminism african nationalism 
and black pride 
nothing that was cut was cut to censor the play said robert 
nemiroff the late playwrights husband and literary executor 
pressures were enormous to keep the play as tight and streamlined 
as it could possibly be 
when the play opened on broadway in 1959 walter kerr writing 
for the new york herald tribune called it an impressive first 
play beautifully acted relieving and wonderfully caustic 
comedy 
directed by lloyd richards it ran for two years and received the 
new york drama critics award for best play it is the story of a 
family whose prospects for the future brighten considerably when 
misfortune strikes the death of walter younger sr leaves his wife 
with a 10000 lifeinsurance policy and the problem of how to use 
it 
her son a chauffeur wants the money to start a new business 
and her daughter needs money for medical school another option the 
wife sees is buying a new home for the family 
in one restored scene a neighbor comes in with a newspaper story 
about the bombing of a black familys house after they had moved 
into a white neighborhood 
this obviously shows the danger the youngers are facing at the 
curtain said bill duke director of the pbs production it 
makes clear that for all the joy and affirmation of the familys 
inner triumph at the end it is anything but a traditional happy 
ending the scene was cut from the broadway production to save the 
added cost of another actors salary 
it took producer philip rose nearly two years to find a 
coproducer and the money to stage the production even with the 
money in hand broadway theaters were not willing to rent to the new 
production until it had proved itself out of town nemiroff said 
but once on stage the shortened play which with an uncany 
prescience foresaw the rise of black pride and nationalism in the 
united states and africa became a hit with both blacks and whites 
never before in the entire history of the american theater had 
so much of the truth of black peoples lives been seen on the 
stage the late author james baldwin wrote 
while not autobiographical raisin had its origins in 
hansberrys own childhood experiences in chicago in the 1930s when 
her family moved into a white neighborhood they were evicted from 
their home by an illinois court but her father a prosperous 
realestate broker and banker fought the case to the us supreme 
court which outlawed the restrictive covenant 
after trying her hand at painting and determining she had no 
talent hansberry moved to new york in 1950 where she concentrated 
on her writing but made little effort at publishing and earned a 
living with a number of odd jobs although she wrote extensively 
she completed only two plays during her brief life a raisin in 
the sun and the sign in sidney brusteins window she died of 
cancer in 1965 at the age of 34 
nemiroff who married hansberry in 1953 has devoted much of his 
life since her death to editing and shaping her works into 
publishable form including the wellreceived to be young gifted 
and black and les blancs 
hal dewindt a teacher director and associate producer of the 
pbs production of raisin said that aside from the restoration 
of the original material this newest version differs from many 
previous productions in one important respect 
every moment is motivated by love as opposed to it being a 
competition between people he said in other productions it was 
more a fight to see who was more powerful the message is much 
clearer and much more universal if it hadnt been done that way it 
would have been just another play about who is more powerful than 
who 
rose and david susskind produced the movie version in 1961 
directed by daniel petrie it starred poitier ruby dee claudia 
mcneil diana sands and lou gossett jr

one holy man walked naked among his 
disciples offering sacred ash blessings and cardamoms as 
consecrated host not far away another holy man delivered a sermon 
while dressed in a saffron robe 
why move naked the second said you can reach god 
dressed 
a third who pitched his tent nearby told his group dress 
does not matter ways do not matter be pure be good and you 
will reach heaven you need no guru 
they were hindu holy men at the hinduisms biggest congregation 
the kumbh mela which began here recently in allahabad 
the three holy men each with different views were examples of 
the diversity of a religion believed to have been practiced since 
the third millennium bc 
they also showed that hinduism with 330 million gods and 
goddesses can be confusing even to hindus 
the religion claims a following of 730 million people in india 
and nepal and parts of bangladesh indonesia thailand in southeast 
asia mauritius in africa and fiji in the south pacific for 
comparison the roman catholic church claims a following of 850 
million 
an estimated 500000 holy men and their followers started camping 
at allahabad on jan 14 for a sevenweek congregation or fair 
during which 30 million to 40 million pilgrims were expected to take 
dips at the sangam the confluence of the three rivers most 
sacred to hindus the ganges the jamuna and the saraswathi 
the sangam which takes its name from a mythical fight 
between gods and demons over a pot of nectar is held every 12 years 
when jupiter enters taurus and the sun and the moon are in capricorn 
you cant explain hinduism said mp asthana who has 
attended four earlier fairs it is a way of life where karmas 
the results of deeds are most important even to an average hindu 
the faith is so confusing 
he added no one can explain how we got to acquire and where 
are our 330 million gods and goddesses 
believers worship images and statues of gods and goddesses as 
well as live animals including rats in hinduism every god has his 
steed or vehicle and the rat is the vehicle of ganesha on whom the 
elephantheaded masterofceremony god rides 
hinduism postulates that everyone goes through a series of 
rebirths or reincarnations that eventually lead to moksha the 
spiritual salvation that frees one from the cycle of rebirths 
with each rebirth you can move closer to or further from 
eventual moksha said asthana who is the spokesman for the state 
government of uttar pradesh in which allahabad is a major city 
the deciding factor is ones karma bad actions result in bad 
karma which leads one to lower incarnation and a step further from 
salvation 
but if ones actions have been good he or she will reincarnate 
on a higher level and be a step closer to eventual freedom from 
rebirth 
coming to allahabad has special significance for hindus and tens 
of thousands come daily to take holy dips at the sangam believing 
doing this during the auspicious planetary conjugation will wash 
away all the sins of a lifetime and release them from the cycle of 
births and rebirths 
it is like appearing directly before god for confessions 
said jagannath dwevedi the chief adminstrator of the fair 
no one knows how bathing will wash off sins but the belief is 
so great that no logic stands 
before taking the dip pilgrims offer milk and marigolds to the 
rivers in a purification ritual and later throw water with their 
hands toward the sky believing that some drops will reach their 
ancestors in the heaven 
now this sounds like a total nonsense but people do it 
said the 56yearold dwevedi it is the ageold belief it is 
above logic 
nagas are the naked recluses of hinduism and they have their own 
logic 
nakedness ends all dichotomy in human life said one 
refusing to give his name we were born naked and therefore should 
remain naked and die naked 
fiftytwo different religious groups put up sprawling tent homes 
at the fair each has its own way to reach god most of them 
constantly smoke marijuana they say it helps them meditate and 
become closer to god 
this makes hinduism unique said asthana there is no 
restriction on how you reach your goal salvation 
only vegetables appear on the fairs menus because devout hindus 
are vegetarians and eating beef is taboo hindus worship the cow

for three days a 73yearold man sat 
stuck in a garbage can up to his armpits on his front porch dressed 
only in a nightshirt while temperatures dipped into the 20s 
now that he has been found dead the community is left with a 
troubling question why didnt somebody help robert hamm 
it was pretty strange said sgt rj liepins who discovered 
hamm on jan 25 we depend on people telling us if they see 
something unusual in the neighborhood so we can check it out that 
didnt happen here 
a postman and a 11yearold newsgirl saw him sitting in the can 
on the enclosed porch several feet from the door but neither 
realized he was in trouble 
he waved to me and i acknowledged just like id done hundreds 
of times before said john vane the postman 
it was a nice day and i just assumed he was sitting there 
reading the paper and smoking a cigar just like always vane said 
monday as he walked away however he thought something didnt look 
right but he said he didnt go back to take a second look 
in retrospect i feel bad about what happened but i really 
didnt think anything was wrong he said 
the newsgirl told her mother liepins said but the woman thought 
her daughter was exaggerating or seeing some kind of reflection 
the girl told her the same thing the next day and finally after 
the girl and her 13yearold brother insisted the woman went to 
hamms home two blocks away looked at the man through the locked 
door on the enclosed porch and called police 
im just kicking myself for not taking this more seriously 
she told the rochester timesunion 
since talking about the incident the family has received death 
threats and prank phone calls liepins said 
hamm lived on a corner lot in a middleclass residential 
neighborhood in rochester 
at a funeral service monday at st monicas catholic church 
father robert gaudio told friends and relatives that they had to 
continue to have faith despite hamms senseless death in a 
ridiculous situation 
his son martin said the family did not want to talk with the 
media but he characterized reports in the local media about his 
father as highly inaccurate and absolutely ghoulish 
some neighbors described hamm as an eccentric and a drinker 
others said he was lonely and appeared to be depressed liepins said 
investigators found open whiskey bottles in the twostory 
woodframe house 
authorities have speculated that hamm suffered a heart attack and 
slumped into the can after resting on its edge or they say he may 
have fallen into the can and then suffered the heart attack 
dr nicholas forbes monroe county medical examiner said hamm 
died of a heart attack but its not possible to determine when it 
happened 
liepins said the door to the porch was locked and he had to break 
a basement window to get into the house he found some money and 
other valuables so police do not suspect any foul play 
the thing that really gets you liepins said is imagining 
yourself in that position and not being able to get help

the government is offering to buy kalashnikov 
assault rifles and other highpowered guns that become illegal today 
under a new firearms law 
owners have until april 30 to apply for the 265 payment home 
secretary douglas hurd said tuesday the sum is based on the price 
such rifles fetched at auction before parliament took up the measure 
in september 1987 
under the new law the penalty for possessing a prohibited weapon 
is up to five years in jail or a 3500 fine 
the firearms amendment act was introduced after michael ryan 
killed 16 people as he strolled through the small town of hungerford 
in august 1987 before taking his own life it bans the private use 
of highpowered selfloading rifles like the kalashnikov which ryan 
used in the massacre and other weapons including shortbarreled 
smoothbore guns 
fully automatic weapons are already prohibited in britain 
the government payment applies to owners who acquired the newly 
banned weapons before september 23 1987 
calls in the united states for greater restrictions on the sale 
of semiautomatic weapons have increased since last months 
shootings in a stockton calif elementary school yard 
patrick purdy killed five children and wounded 30 people with a 
kalashnikov ak47 assault rifle before ending his own life police

in the first successful prosecution of 
its kind in britain two men were sentenced to a month in jail for 
causing a fox to suffocate after trapping it in its lair 
some spectators applauded after barry pruden 27 and stephen 
horton 27 were sentenced tuesday by magistrates in this north 
central city near liverpool pruden and horton both of liverpool 
were also banned for two years from keeping any animal 
the royal society for the protection of animals which filed the 
complaint against the two men argued that the fox was made captive 
when the men blocked two holes to its lair the two were found 
guilty on jan 3 of causing unnecessary suffering to a captive fox 
it was the first time anyone was found convicted of such a crime 
despite years of antifox hunting efforts by animal rights activists 
animal rights groups have battled for years to disrupt blood 
sports such as fox hunting they have laid false trails for hounds 
bought grounds used for deer hunts once two men desecrated the 
grave of englands greatest fox hunter the duke of beaufort

the international press institute is urging the 
peruvian government to investigate the murder of a journalist and do 
more to safeguard other threatened members of the press 
the respected londonbased organization in a message to 
president alan garcia perez on tuesday called violence against 
journalists a gross violation of their right to work 
the institutes director peter galliner wrote that the 
institute is extremely concerned at the lack of any 
investigation into the murder of hugo bustios 34 a local 
correspondent for the lima news magazine caretas 
bustios and another journalist 27yearold eduardo rojas were 
shot by gunmen in november while traveling by motorcycle on the 
outskirts of the peruvian city of huanta rojas was seriously 
wounded 
furthermore we deplore the recent increase in violence against 
journalists in general the message says 
whilst we are aware of the current complex situation in peru 
we would remind you that such attacks are a gross violation of the 
right of journalists to gather information and the right of people 
everywhere to receive information it says 
we strongly urge an immediate and rigorous enquiry into the 
murder of the caretas correspondent and that your government acts 
at once to ensure that journalists may pursue their work without 
interference or fear of their physical safety it says 
peruvian officials said they had not determined whether bustios 
murder was carried out by the shining path insurgency a 
maoinspired group which has been fighting to overthrow the 
government for eight years or a new antirebel death squad called 
the rodigo franco command 
both groups have threatened journalists in and around ayacucho 
the birthplace of the shining path 30 miles south of huanta

tobacco heiress doris dukes pet camels wont be 
wintering in hawaii after all instead princess and bebe will 
remain at ms dukes estate in hillsborough nj her attorney said 
the main reason to keep them in new jersey this winter is 
though the permit process was successful it came at a time when it 
would make it too difficult to transport them don robinson said 
monday 
ms duke 75 planned to keep the bactrian camels at her 49acre 
oceanfront estate while she winters in hawaii 
an application to house the pets in the exclusive residential 
area was approved by the state board of agriculture but other 
officials were angry that the camels would not be quarantined for 
three months as other islandbound pets are the board treated the 
camels as cattle rather than pets exempting them from the 
quarantine 
the publicity shy ms duke made headlines recently when she 
posted 5 million bail for her friend former philippines first lady 
imelda marcos who was arraigned in october in new york on

soviet soldiers smiled and waved as 
their convoy left kabul for home today on the strategic salang 
highway an afghan government spokesman said heavy shelling could 
be heard just up the road 
at dawn the convoy moved through a checkpoint about two miles 
from the capital en route to the soviet border 250 miles miles 
away said an interior ministry spokesman who identified himself 
only as hamad 
the spokesman said the convoy mostly made up of trucks carrying 
up to 50 soldiers each took 50 minutes to pass through the 
checkpoint 
they were happy to be leaving they were smiling and waving 
he said 
hamad said artillery fire heard about six miles up the road came 
from guerrillas hiding in the mountains that surround the highway 
the only land route home for red army troops in kabul 
afghan soldiers refused to allow any nonmilitary vehicles up the 
road citing the possibility of heavy shelling but crowded buses 
traveled south down the highway with people riding on top dressed 
in ragged shawls and turbans that flapped in the winter wind 
hamad declined to say when the next convoy would move out but 
said convoys have been leaving every other day in recent weeks 
on tuesday lt gen boris gromov commander of the red army 
forces in afghanistan wooould not say how many soviet troops 
remained in the country or when the withdrawal would be completed 
gromov also denied us allegations that the soviets were 
conducting a scorched earth policy as their last units leave 
afghanistan in advance of a feb 15 deadline 
in neighboring pakistans capital of islamabad western diplomats 
said all soviet forces were expected to be out of kabul by feb 6 
nine days before the deadline set by a unmediated withdrawal 
agreement 
spokesmen in islamabad for the guerrillas who began fighting 
after a communist coup 11 years ago said four longrange soviet 
missiles killed 70 people this week in villages near the salang 
highway 
according to the western diplomats the increase in attacks by 
soviet and government forces appeared aimed at pressuring the 
insurgents toward a political settlement the guerrillas have 
refused offers of such a settlement from both the kremlin and its 
client government in kabul 
the last 11 staff members of the us embassy which was closed 
monday left kabul on tuesday and a soviet airlift of food and fuel 
resumed 
six ilyushin 76 transport planes dropped flares to deflect 
missiles as they landed at midday tuesday each was followed by a 
camouflaged military helicopter dropping flares 
guerrillas supported by the united states and pakistan control 
the hills and mountains around kabul and often fire heatseaking 
missiles at aircraft near the airport 
they also have attacked supply convoys bound for kabul on the 
salang causing severe food and fuel shortages that made the soviet 
airlift necessary 
soviet and western diplomats estimate the number of soviet 
soldiers still in afghanistan at 1500020000 red army soldiers 
arrived in afghanistan in december 1979 and an estimated 115000 
were in the country when the pullout began may 15 
some military advisers will remain in afghanistan in keeping with 
a sovietafghan agreement gromov said the united states contends 
such a presence would violate the geneva agreements of april 14 
under which the withdrawal is being conducted 
i want to underline the soviet union will fulfill its 
commitments under the geneva agreements gromov said adding we 
dont intend to bomb the territory of afghanistan from soviet 
territory after the withdrawal of soviet soldiers 
heavy fighting has occurred between soviet and afghan troops and 
the guerrillas of ahmed shah masoud along the salang highway 
masoud one of the best insurgent field commanders controls the 
panjshir valley through which the highway runs 
in moscow colgen bronislav omelichev first deputy soviet 
chief of staff said tuesday our troops deliver strikes or engage 
in combat operations just to secure the safety of the withdrawal of 
our troops to the territory of the soviet union 
gromov said the afghan government had negotiated with masoud to 
make the salang highway safe but he rejected the offer and began 
attacking afghan army outposts jan 23 
i think he is sorry now the general said

a federal judge ordered the release of a man 
accused of trying to export nerve gas despite the governments 
contention that the suspect was a threat to national security 
because he held highly sensitive classified documents 
juhwan yun was scheduled to be released on 2 million bail this 
afternoon after us district judge h lee sarokin ruled that the 
government had failed to demonstrate that yun was a risk to flee 
federal prosecutors are appealing the ruling 
at a hearing tuesday assistant us attorney anne singer had 
argued that the koreanamerican businessmans ties with foreign 
governments and military bases abroad would make him likely to flee 
to avoid prosecution 
singer also disclosed that yun 48 of short hills nj held 
documents revealing the united states capability to intercept enemy 
communications she said the documents were found on a desk at yuns 
importexport business 
yun appears to have had contact with individuals in or 
associated with branches of the us military andor military 
installations abroad ms singer said in a letter to the court 
revelation of the information would not only compromise 
specifics of our ew electronic warfare capabilities but would also 
reveal details of our knowledge of enemy threat navy capt m 
oetinger vice director of the pentagons joint electronic warfare 
center said in a memorandum to the us customs service 
yun was arrested jan 12 by us customs agents when he arrived 
for a meeting with an undercover agent he believed was an arms 
dealer 
military documents found afterward in yuns office were used by 
the government previously to argue that yun should not be released 
on bail ms singer has argued that yun apparently had contacts with 
several foreign governments which would prefer he not stand trial 
in the case 
the government previously has said yun may have had contacts at 
us military installations the documents filed tuesday reveal for 
the first time that those contacts may have been at us bases in 
other countries 
lt col arnie williams a spokesman for the pentagon declined 
comment until he had time to review the new government disclosures 
the new information also alleges that koreanlanguage documents 
marked secret show how much is known about an unidentified 
enemys electronic signals and gives details of specialized warfare 
systems expected for use in the year 1992 and beyond 
although the documents were in korean the governments new 
filings do not say if they were from the south korean government or 
if the enemy mentioned was north korea 
the documents also discussed electronic countermeasures the 
jamming of enemy signals and the deposition numbers and locations 
of enemy forces according to the court papers 
yun is charged along with a british national for allegedly 
plotting to buy the nerve gas sarin and other military equipment for 
export authorities have said the nerve gass possible destination 
was iran 
richard cimusz an fbi counterintelligence agent said in a new 
affidavit filed tuesday that yun had been investigated previously 
for allegedly trying to obtain other military equipment including 
nightvision equipment fighter planes and tank parts 
the government has said yun boasted of highlevel military and 
civilian contacts with yugoslavia the peoples republic of china 
and south korea 
cimusz said yun has had contact with officials of two different 
countries that are of counterintellgence interest to the fbi and 
that he had official documents from a third country of 
counterintelligence interest to the fbi

an aidsinfected prostitute who has 
unprotected sex with her customers will spread the killer virus to 
60 adults and one unborn baby over a fiveyear period a study 
suggests 
the study published in februarys issue of the journal of sex 
research was based solely on statistical calculations and didnt 
analyze actual cases of prostitutes with aids it said 20 men 40 of 
their female partners and one unborn baby would be infected with the 
incurable disease 
the fact that one very active prostitute could be responsible 
for about one infected baby seems pretty high when you consider the 
number of prostitutes infected with the virus santa clara 
university statistician steven nahmias said tuesday 
but the study supports the notion that prostitutes are a major 
source of spreading aids to the heterosexual community nahmias 
said in a telephone interview 
there are public policy implications in terms of getting 
prostitutes off the street who are infected with aids but im not 
advocating quarantining them he said its not my job to 
suggest actions 
because the study is based on certain assumptions the figures 
nahmias calculated are probably high but how high really cant be 
determined said dr david dassey deputy medical director of the 
aids program office at the los angeles county department of health 
services 
the issue is not whether we get rid of prostitutes dassey 
said the issue is whether people make healthy choices about who 
they have sex with 
nahmias said his study assumed condoms werent used so the 
estimates would be lower if clients of prostitutes use latex 
prophylactics 
the study based on mathematical formulas and assumptions nahmias 
called reasonable predicted that one active aidsinfected 
prostitute could be expected within a fiveyear period to infect 20 
men who would infect 40 other female sex partners who in turn 
would produce 08 infected children 
recent studies have shown the aids infection rate among 
prostitutes is about 6 percent in los angeles about 9 percent to 21 
percent in new york city and 49 percent in northern new jersey 
where most of those infected also abused intravenous drugs a major 
way the virus is spread 
nahmias study assumed that only two of the 40 women infected by 
prostitutes clients became pregnant during the fiveyear period 
which may mean the number of aidsinfected babies is understated 
the study also didnt estimate the total number of aids cases 
resulting from a single prostitute for example it excluded men 
infected by women who were infected by prostitutes clients 
on the other hand dassey said the estimates may be high because 
it assumed that each prostitute engaged in 2000 sexual contacts 
yearly more than five daily including with repeat clients and 
that each male client engaged in sex 200 times annually 
the study assumed a 1in500 chance that the aids virus would be 
spread during a single sexual act dassey and nahmias agreed that 
figure is valid based on several studies of maletofemale 
transmission but dassey said the risk is probably lower for 
femaletomale transmission 
he also said the study assumed all sex acts were vaginal 
intercourse and ignored the likelihood that prostitutes more 
frequently perform oral sex upon clients an act less likely to 
spread the aids virus 
nahmias however said his figures might be understated because 
they ignore increased odds that prostitutes and their clients also 
suffer sores from other venereal diseases which would likely raise 
the chance of aids infection from a single sex act higher than 1 in 
500 
the journal of sex research is published by the society for the 
scientific study of sex and is edited by researchers at the 
university of california los angeles

the governments plan for a major reform of the 
free national health service cutting billions in state costs by 
letting big hospitals charge fees and by promoting private insurance 
is meeting stiff opposition 
many doctors nurses and major unions expressed serious 
reservations about the plan announced tuesday by the conservative 
government some condemned it as an attempt to dismantle the system 
prime minister margaret thatcher called the legislative proposals 
the most farreaching reform of the national health service in its 
40year history 
health secretary kenneth clarke the cabinet member heading the 
service added all our proposals share a common purpose to make 
the health service a place where patients come first 
but the opposition labor party accused the government of trying 
to wreck the national health service 
rodney bickerstaffe secretary of the national union of public 
employees one of the main health service unions condemned it as 
a cynical charter to dismember the national health service and 
transplant britains health care in a commercial circus 
the 650000member union represents hospital cleaners porters 
kitchen staff and other health service workers 
the british medical association said in a statement that it had 
serious reservations about whether the proposals will produce the 
desired improvements in the quality of services 
under the plan the 320 largest and most sophisticated of the 
2000 national health service hospitals can become independent in 
1991 taking feepaying private patients and billing local 
authorities for others 
the 320 selfgoverning hospitals under the government plan also 
will be able to charge patients for extras such as meals private 
telephones or television 
for the first time too private health insurance for the elderly 
the biggest burden on the state system will be taxdeductible 
the selfgoverning hospitals under the government plan will be 
able to attract quality staff from consultants to cleaners by 
setting their own pay scales the government said 
other planned changes include fining general practitioners who 
prescribe too many medicines 
under the plan family doctors with big practices will get 
separate state budgets to buy drugs and hospital treatment from 
private state or selfgoverning hospitals for elective surgery 
they will be allowed to keep half of any savings on the drugs budget 
consultants and general practitioners will have their costs 
independently audited and like hospitals will be encouraged to 
compete for patients 
the plan to be drafted as a government bill needs parliamentary 
approval to become law but the governments overwhelming 
parliamentary majority ensures its passage and the entire package of 
proposed changes is expected to be in force within three years 
the national health service came into operation on july 5 1948 
part of a wave of social legislation by clement attlees labor party 
government designed to give britons a better postwar life 
the new plan is seen by some as an attempt to borrow from the 
american health system with its emphasis on private care without 
increasing spending 
the national health service operates alongside a smaller system 
of private hospitals and other medical care the private system is 
not affected by the government plans unveiled tuesday 
government officials said the plan will streamline the health 
bureaucracy give the public wider choice but deny no one access to 
free treatment 
trevor clay general secretary of the royal college of nursing 
representing health service nurses said i do not see much 
consumer choice in these proposals as patients we all have a 
price tag on our heads now 
some of this looks like a return to the elite voluntary 
hospitals and local authority infirmaries when i first started 
nursing before world war ii 
the national health service has 1 million staff used by 90 
percent of the population it is generally popular and mrs thatcher 
has held back from exposing it to her strategy of rolling back 
socialism instead spending has increased by nearly onethird since 
1979 to 387 billion a year

joel steinberg will appeal his manslaughter 
conviction by arguing that the judge in the childkilling case was 
prejudiced from the start an attorney said 
attorney ira london said tuesday he remembered that state judge 
harold rothwax predicted at a pretrial bail hearing that steinberg 
was probably guilty probably would be found guilty and probably 
would be sentenced to life in prison 
london said rothwax used prejudicial rulings and inflammatory 
evidence to coax the jury toward a conviction on a more serious 
charge so he would not seem wrong 
after all london said if there were a seconddegree 
manslaughter conviction here it certainly would have made his 
earlier opinion look foolish 
steinberg 47 was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter monday 
in the death of lisa steinberg the 6yearold girl he illegally 
adopted at birth 
london said rothwax prejudiced the case by repeatedly letting the 
jury view a videotape of a seriously beaten hedda nussbaum the 
defendants former livein companion and by his instructions to the 
jury regarding the definition of intent 
there is no question in my mind from the length of the 
deliberations and from talking to the jurors that joel got a 
fair shake from the jurors london said at his brooklyn office 
but it is a serious issue whether joel got a fair trial because of 
the judges rulings 
london said neither he nor his cocounsel at the trial adrian 
diluzio had spoken to steinberg since the verdict 
were going to have to make a provision for him to be kept in 
protective custody in upstate new york assuming he gets a serious 
jail sentence and i would anticipate that happening london said 
but he said steinberg is not afraid joel is not a fearing 
person london said hes been able to handle himself in a safe 
way at rikers island jail rikers island has not been without 
incident but hes done ok there 
also tuesday ms nussbaums attorneys barry scheck and betty 
levinson said their client was relieved and gratified that 
steinberg had been convicted and will now try to make herself into 
a useful person 
scheck said ms nussbaum will remain at the four winds 
psychiatric facility in katonah ny for a while 
ms levinson ms nussbaums civil attorney noted that she had 
filed a multimilliondollar lawsuit against steinberg basically 
for the destruction of her life 
she needs the wherewithal to put her life together again ms 
levinson said and that includes financial ability

slowly gingerly benumbed alaskans 
emerged from their shuttered homes and shops as a mass of bitterly 
cold air that broke temperature records blew southward into canada 
and the lower 48 states today 
with the icy weather went high winds that raked much of the state 
earlier in the week resulting in at least one death on tuesday 
the body of a man whose skiff was swamped by high seas and strong 
winds off the coast of southeast alaska was found on a beach 
anchorage helped by sunny skies recorded a toasty high of minus 
2 degrees substantially above the doubledigit subzero lows that 
plagued alaskas largest city during the twoweek cold snap 
joe inderbitzen the owner of alaska cab said his drivers still 
were scrambling to keep up with a nonstop demand for rides but the 
destinations changed a bit with the warmer weather tuesday night 
people are starting to go out a little more inderbitzen 
said theyre going to the bars and the restaurants a little more 
i noticed it tonight 
business also was getting back to normal in valdez north 
americas northernmost icefree harbor where winds gusting to 93 
mph had shut down the transalaska oil pipeline terminal and caused 
officials to reduce the flow of oil from the north slope by 65 
percent 
tankers banned earlier from the harbor because the wind made the 
valdez narrows dangerous were allowed to pick up loads at the 
terminal tuesday and flow in the pipeline was expected to increase 
to normal levels of more than 2 million barrels daily said alyeska 
pipeline service co spokesman tom brennan the national weather 
service said temperatures in much of alaska would moderate toward 
the end of the week but remain well below normal for this time of 
year 
the arctic air lingered over alaska for more than a week locked 
in place by a warmair jet stream that blew more northerly than 
usual the weather service said when the jet stream shifted south 
the icy mass broke free sending balmy temperatures plunging in 
canada the northern plains and the midwest 
eagle village store owner frank robbins said residents in that 
tiny yukon river village 360 miles northeast of anchorage were 
taking the cold in stride 
most of the people are accustomed to this he said our 
average temperature for this time of year is 25 or 30 below its 
not that bad we havent had any cold weather like this in six 
years but it used to be pretty normal 
major hospitals in the state reported only minor increases in 
emergencyroom cases related to the cold 
most of the frostbite victims who went to the fairbanks memorial 
hospital emergency room in recent weeks were adults who had to walk 
in the cold after their cars quit running said susan mclane a 
nursing supervisor 
the victim of the boating accident was identified as 35yearold 
scott st clair a companion who was in another skiff told the coast 
guard that st clair was caught in 10 to 15foot seas and 55 mph 
winds monday evening 
in anchorage firefighters remained busier than usual responding 
to reports of waterspewing pipes that broke with the cold and a 
surge in residential fires many traced to attempts to thaw frozen 
pipes

until then i wouldnt want to speculate further he said 
lukens reached at his washington home by the associated press 
tuesday night said i have no comment 
wbnstv quoted a columbus woman annie coffman as saying lukens 
has been involved with her teenage daughter over a period of years 
beginning when she was 13 the girl is now 17 the station said 
the station reported that ms coffman wore a hidden microphone 
when she confronted lukens at a fastfood restaurant in columbus 
last november she said lukens admitted being with her daughter and 
other girls according to the report police have heard a tape of 
the conversation but would not comment on its contents the station 
reported 
the woman claims lukens offered her a government job as a bribe 
the station reported 
ms coffman said she would not discuss the case 
my daughter has been through enough shes feeling a lot of 
pressure right now ms coffman told the columbus dispatch in a 
story published today 
lukens served two terms in congress beginning in 1966 his 
district was eliminated in 1970 and he lost a 1970 bid for governor 
in the republican primary lukens is from middletown about 35 miles 
north of cincinnati

five years for not filing campaign reports on time however that 
campaign law was changed before the fiveyear period expired and he 
was elected to the state senate in 1974 
he served in the state senate until he returned to congress in 
1986 representing the 8th congressional district in southwestern 
ohio he was reelected in 1988 
in 1974 while in the state senate he fought allegations that he 
accepted 1000 in campaign contributions from korean businessman 
tongsun park during his first stint on capitol hill 
he denied the charge presenting the results of a voluntary lie 
detector test he took after the allegations surfaced those results 
indicated lukens was not lying when he said he had not received a 
campaign contribution from park 
park told investigators he had contributed 850000 in 
contributions to selected congressmen in the late 1960s and early 
1970s but denied repeatedly that he was acting as an agent of the 
south korean government

soviet students will for the first time be allowed 
to present their own interpretations of history at exam time a 
newspaper reported 
history exams were canceled last year because textbooks have been 
outpaced by media reports making new revelations about the countrys 
past 
under a new system this year teachers will be allowed to devise 
their own tests and students will be permitted to disagree with 
teachers and textbooks without being penalized the national 
teachers newspaper uchitelskaya gazeta said 
final history exams were called off last year because the 
textbooks on which they were based were at odds with accounts of 
soviet history being printed by the moreopen soviet media 
including the exposure of some of the atrocities under dictator 
josef v stalin 
students finishing the 10th and final grade of soviet middle 
school last year had oral discussions with their teachers instead of 
exams 
gennady a yagodin chairman of the state education committee 
decided history tests would resume this school year but students 
will be given more leeway to interpret history uchitelskaya gazeta 
said in its report tuesday 
various opinions in all questions of the history of the country 
are not only allowed they are completely natural vladimir 
shadrikov the vice chairman of the state education committee wrote 
in the article 
the old tests were part of the rigid soviet educational system 
that was based on rote learning in the past soviet high school 
students were expected to repeat what their textbooks told them on 
given subjects for example on the foreign policy guidelines laid 
down by the 27th communist party congress 
shadrikov said the only criterion for the new history exams is 
that they be structured to show the maximum knowledge of a 
particular student

plans to appoint former soviet human rights 
activist natan sharansky as israels ambassador to the united 
nations met with considerable opposition today 
but some news reports indicated it was likely that the 
41yearold sharansky would win the cabinets approval for the post 
in announcing sharanskys candidacy senior officials said israel 
hoped his international popularity could boost israels image which 
has been tarnished by the palestinian uprising 
arguments against sharanskys appointment have focused on the 
short time he has spent in israel he arrived from the soviet union 
on feb 11 1986 and his past sharansky served nine years in 
soviet prisons and labor camps on charges of spying for the united 
states charges he denies 
the fear is that the choice of sharanskys for the highprofile 
post could insult moscow just as israel is trying to rebuild ties 
the soviets severed 21 years ago over its seizure of arab lands in 
the 1967 middle east war 
two israeli newspapers quoted unnamed officials in the us state 
department as warning that giving sharansky such a highranking 
diplomatic post could derailing efforts to restore ties with moscow 
israeli officials expressed similar concerns and a popular 
columnist for the haaretz newspaper compared the sharansky 
designation with appointing jonathan pollard an american convicted 
of spying for israel as ambassador to washington if he were freed 
from jail 
the hadashot and maariv newspapers asserted however that the 
soviets would not be offended by sharanskys appointment because the 
kremlin now has a more liberal emigration policy 
israel radio said foreign ministry officials objected to the move 
both out of diplomatic concerns and because it would violate a 
longstanding practice of requiring a new immigrant to live at least 
11 years in the country before becoming a foreign diplomat 
rightwing israeli officials were concerned that sharansky was 
not well enough versed on the arabisraeli conflict citing meetings 
he once held with faisal husseini a proplo leader in the occupied 
territories sharansky had said he was not aware of husseins ties 
to the plo 
sharansky the symbol of the soviet jewry emigration struggle 
immigrated after a dramatic eastwest swap of people imprisoned on 
spying charges 
despite the criticism hadashot predicted sharansky would win the 
appointment and said foreign minister moshe arens was simply waiting 
for sharanskys response to the bid 
sharansky said tuesday he had not been officially offered the job 
and declined to comment 
today sharansky indicated he would consider the offer seriously 
he was quoted by the hadashot daily as saying 
the job of un ambassador is honorable and important and in 
the meantime i thank everyone who is proposing me for this lofty 
job when there is really something to talk about i will talk 
but a government official said sharansky had also indicated he 
was hesitant about the offer 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said sharansky 
was concerned about whether he could succeed despite his lack of 
diplomatic experience and that his wife avital objects to leaving 
jerusalem 
mrs sharansky was also quoted by the yediot ahronot newspaper as 
saying i want to have a lot of children and would prefer to do so 
here in jerusalem the couple now has two daughters rachel 2 
and hannah two months

a survivor of a 1987 continental airlines crash has 
been awarded slightly more than 800000 in damages about half what 
continental officials say she was offered in an outofcourt 
settlement 
a us district court jury deliberated three days before awarding 
779000 to karen johnson of boise idaho plus 21700 for her 
husband bob cook the jury reached the verdict tuesday 
the couple was denied punitive damages 
johnson suffered a damaged heart muscle and permanent double 
vision from nerve damage in the nov 15 1987 crash of continental 
flight 1713 at denvers stapleton international airport 
twentyeight people died and 54 were injured in the crash 
continental attorney bob harris said the 800000 award was 
appropriate and said continental had approached the couple before 
the trial with a 16 million settlement proposal that was rejected 
johnson said she was hopeful that her lawsuit would prompt 
continental to learn from its mistakes i hope it will cause 
reforms at continental and all other airlines that cut corners 
she said 
the verdict followed nearly three weeks of testimony before us 
district judge sherman finesilver 
the jury cited continental for reckless and willful 
misconduct and for misleading advertising that falsely underscored 
the airlines concern for safety 
the panel also found negligence on the part of the federal 
aviation administration because of the conduct of flight controllers 
who allowed the continental dc9 to sit on a runway in a snowstorm 
more than 20 minutes after undergoing deicing 
the plane was bound for boise when it crashed 
richard j hillman continental vice president for flight 
operations said continental already has paid 20 million in 
outofcourt settlements in 36 other crashrelated lawsuits 
johnson had claimed continental relaxed its pilot training 
requirements and shortchanged its deicing procedures to pay for 
market expansion and advertising 
continental has admitted partial responsibility for the crash 
but said it also believed the faa was to blame because of the 
takeoff delay 
the national transportation safety board has ruled that the crash 
was caused by a combination of weather factors and pilot errors

a military court sentenced six palestinians to 
up to two years in prison for throwing stones and an army official 
said today that the unusually harsh sentences were intended to deter 
other youths 
two of the defendants sentenced tuesday were teenagers and in 
at least three cases the punishment was for throwing stones at 
soldiers 
no one was hurt in the stonethrowing incidents the army 
official said but added stones have the potential of causing 
death just like live ammunition 
the fact that no one was injured cannot necessarily be held to 
the credit of the defendants said the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity the punishment was meted out not only as a 
punishment but also as a deterrent for the defendants and the 
general public 
meanwhile in the occupied gaza strip today four people were shot 
and wounded in clashes between troops and stonethrowing 
palestinians arab doctors said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
in arab east jerusalem assailants hurled a firebomb at an 
israeli bus on a main thoroughfare wounding the driver police said 
police blocked off the street and aimed water cannons spewing 
yellow liquid at nearby shops breaking a halfdozen shop signs 
witnesses said three arab schoolgirls were detained police said 
tuesdays prison terms were unprecedented in severity in the 
past stonethrowers have received only fines or jail terms of 
several months 
the sentences for the six ranged from 18 to 24 months in prison 
plus suspended terms of 18 to 40 months and fines of 417 to 833 
the israeli daily haaretz said three of the incidents involved 
stonethrowing at soldiers it said the defendants were aged 15 to 
22 
the military has tried various tactics in the gaza strip and west 
bank to halt stonethrowing which army officials have called the 
most persistent problem since the palestinian uprising began nearly 
14 months ago 
an early policy of beating palestinians caught rioting was less 
used after the practice raised criticism abroad the firing of 
plastic bullets and rubbercoated steel balls also was criticized by 
human rights groups after more than 50 deaths resulted from their 
use but use of the ammunition continues 
at least 37o palestinians have been killed most by army gunfire 
since the uprising against israeli occupation began fifteen 
israelis also have died 
the sentences tuesday are part of the latest gettough policy 
introduced by the army last month 
other measures include demolishing houses of some stone throwers 
and permission for troops to fire plastic bullets at palestinians 
running away from a stonethrowing incident or erecting stone 
roadblocks

a battle that began a year ago today when 
two indians took over a smalltown newspaper to draw attention to 
alleged corruption remains unresolved with the two fugitives suing 
the state 
eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs who were acquitted in december 
on federal hostagetaking charges in connection with the siege in 
lumberton filed the lawsuit tuesday alleging the state was 
harassing them by filing separate charges 
the lawsuit also was filed by the robeson county defense 
committee a group of indians and blacks formed during the past year 
to voice concern about oppression 
jacobs attorney lewis pitts said the groups involvement in 
the lawsuit shows the people of robeson county are a changed 
people 
no longer will they sit by and take the reign of terror and the 
oppression and this lawsuit reflects their changed attitude said 
pitts 
they are calling the emperor naked thats the positive spirit 
here one year after the takeover 
hatcher says he doesnt see an end to the standoff 
just because im not in north carolina doesnt mean im not in 
their hair he said in a telephone interview from idaho where he 
is seeking sanctuary with the shoshonebannock indians 
brandishing sawedoff shotguns the tuscarora indians walked into 
the robesonian newspaper office in lumberton and took up to 20 
hostages 
they said they had evidence of law enforcement involvement in 
drug trafficking in robeson county whose population is evenly 
divided between blacks whites and indians hatcher also said 
federal officials were repeatedly presented with information 
concerning racial injustice and police corruption in robeson county 
over the years but failed to rectify the problems 
gov jim martin ended the siege without injuries to the hostages 
by agreeing to form a task force to investigate the allegations 
hatcher and jacobs were charged with federal firearms violations 
and hostagetaking held in a federal prison at butner then moved 
through a series of county jails while awaiting trial 
they were denied bond three times before a threejudge panel of 
the us court of appeals ordered their release in july the full 
appeals court later agreed to reconsider that decision and ordered 
them back to jail 
jacobs complied but hatcher fled and surfaced a few days before 
his trial in september with a lawyer from the center for 
constitutional law in new york 
after a threeweek trial a federal jury on oct 14 acquitted the 
two of all charges 
hatcher and jacobs had met with the taskforce panel once but it 
concluded there was no evidence to back up their charges 
on dec 6 a special session of the robeson county grand jury 
indicted the pair on 14 charges of seconddegree kidnapping hatcher 
was arrested at the offices of the robeson county defense committee 
that day but jacobs fled to new york 
hatcher was freed on 25000 bond which was posted by the 
national council of churches but jumped bail and fled to the 
onondaga reservation near syracuse ny where jacobs was hiding 
hatcher later left new york for idaho 
jacobs was arrested dec 13 outside the reservation after fleeing 
from a state trooper and crashing his car into an empty school bus 
his 25000 bond also was posted by the national council of churches 
hatcher failed to make a court appearance in robeson county 
earlier this month saying he feared for his life should he return 
and his bond was ordered forfeited jacobs extradition is pending 
the lawsuit says the state charges are just intimidation and 
harassment and asks a federal judge to block their extradition 
and declare the state charges unconstitutional 
it asks for at least 10000 in damages from each of the 20 
defendants and a judgement declaring unconstitutional the campaign 
of intimidation and harassment it alleges is being conducted in 
robeson county 
the lawsuit which was filed by the defense committee names 
martin state attorney general lacy thornburg and several other law 
enforcement officials as defendants 
thornburg said the state did not intend to stop pressing for 
extradition 
it is clear that this lawsuit represents a thinly disguised 
effort to prevent the state of north carolina from pursuing the 
extradition and criminal prosecution of mr hatcher and mr jacobs 
for holding 14 innocent people at gunpoint and against their will 
thornburg said 
the state will do everything within its power to see that these 
individuals are extradited to north carolina to stand trial on state 
charges

a weapons manufacturer is about to give buyers a 
whiff of war 
bei defense systems is promoting its extraordinarily lethal 
flechette rockets with scratchandsniff advertisements in trade 
publications 
the ads emblazoned with the slogan the smell of victory 
release the smell of cordite the aroma that follows a rocket 
explosion 
my advertising usually gets lost in magazines said george 
coutoumanos director of us government programs for bei who came 
up with the idea 
i usually get buried by the big guys the boeings and the 
general dynamics whos going to read my ad when they can look at a 
beautiful f16 going over the countryside 
the rocket and electronics manufacturer is small by defense 
industry standards last year it handled about 47 million in 
defense contracts 
specifically coutoumanos is trying to convince us military 
buyers and other defense hardware shoppers that his 400800 
rockets are a better value than more highprofile missiles such as 
stingers 
id really like to hire a major star and get them to sing and 
dance but it doesnt work that way coutoumanos said and 
shooting off rockets on television isnt really appropriate i 
think 
bei was helped in producing its advertisement by the firm bozell 
jacobs kenyon amp eckhardt 
coutoumanos said the ad will debut in the feb 1 international 
editions of the armed forces journal 
next year im going to do the sound of victory he said 
youre going to run your thumbnail across some kind of strip and 
you will hear the explosions

a man who hijacked a colombian 
airliner and threatened to set fire to one of the 122 people aboard 
was overpowered by the copilot before the plane landed in costa 
rica a passenger said 
police arrested the hijacker after the boeing 727 landed tuesday 
at the juan santamaria airport near san jose said interior minister 
carlos disanti 
the red cross treated some passengers for shock officials said 
but no other injuries were reported to them or the sixmember crew 
the hijacker who reportedly carried two orange juice cartons of 
gasoline fitted with wicks commandeered the ace airlines flight 
about 10 minutes after it left san andres island colombia for 
medellin colombia 
the public security ministry identified the hijacker as 
nicaraguan exile alvin antonio siu and said he will either be 
charged in costa rica or deported to colombia three other 
passengers were questioned and released it said 
the hijacker during the flight told the pilot jaime perez he 
would burn a passenger alive if he did not divert the flight to 
costa rica said a costa rican air traffic controller carlos 
paniagua 
humberto campos a passenger who was sitting toward the front of 
the plane said passengers noticed the man when they saw he was 
carrying orange juice cartons and speaking nervously with a flight 
attendant 
then he spoke with the captain and told him to divert the plane 
to any central american country jamaica or miami but the captain 
persuaded him to land somewhere close because of lack of fuel 
campos said he said the cabin door was open and passengers could 
hear the conversation 
the copilot overpowered the hijacker and took the cartons away 
when the man looked out one of the cabin windows shortly before 
landing campos said 
the hijackers motives were unclear but radio reloj reported it 
received an anonymous telephone call saying the hijacker was seeking 
the release an american and several colombians held in costa rica on 
drug charges 
the report did not identify those being held 
hernan garron the public security minister said siu was a 
miskito indian living on san andres island thousands of miskito 
sumo and rama indians fled nicaraguas atlantic region in 1981 after 
the sandinista government tried to impose control on their 
traditionally autonomous area 
some indians remained behind to fight the government and the 
sandinistas eventually reached peace agreements with some indian 
groups

an electric stove caused the fire that 
killed a prosolidarity priest a church official said today 
the final results of an inspection of the scene are not 
available yet but i can say the cause of the fire was an electric 
stove in a little room next to the bedroom said the rev cezary 
potocki 
it even caused the floor boards to burn up there are still a 
lot of questions but to a great extent one can say the stove caused 
the fire potocki said 
the rev stanislaw suchowolec 31 died monday from smoke 
inhalation in the northeastern city of bialystok his death provoked 
controversy because another priest the rev stefan niedzielak 74 
died of a broken neck jan 21 
the government said today that the inquiry was continuing into 
the niedzielaks death niedzielak was primarily known for a shrine 
he maintained to poles killed in the soviet union during world war 
ii but also was sympathetic to solidarity 
the government said tuesday it has no evidence the priests 
deaths were politically provoked 
there is no ground to suppose that there is someone going 
around poland and spreading death among priests government 
spokesman jerzy urban said there is no evidence to assume or 
suppose the existence of a political provocation 
a housekeeper sounded the alarm after smelling smoke early 
monday urban said another priest found suchowolec and his dead dog 
lying next to a couch in the bedroom he said 
potocki said suchowolecs funeral would be held friday at the 
immaculate heart of marys church in bialystok a city 120 miles

early in his six years as a priest he served for three years as 
a vicar in suchowola home village of the rev jerzy popieluszko a 
prosolidarity priest who was murdered by security police in 1984 
suchowolec had organized pilgrimages to popieluszkos grave in 
warsaw 
zofia romaszewka of the solidarity commission on intervention 
and law abidance said suchowolec had told the commission he had

after a month of public feuding the family of 
braindamaged singercomposer barry sadler of ballad of green 
berets fame has agreed to the appointment of an independent 
guardian to handle his affairs 
the agreement was announced tuesday by probate judge john j 
donnelly following two days of hearings on sadlers mental 
competence 
while the judge agreed sadler was incompetent to handle his 
affairs he said he had no jurisdiction to rule in the case because 
sadler is not an ohio resident 
at the same time sadlers family has agreed to let a probate 
judge in nashville tenn name an independent guardian donnelly 
said 
sadlers mother bebe and son thor 24 had made competing 
appeals to be named his guardian 
under the agreement the guardian must consult with family 
members before making major decisions for sadler according to 
donnelly who said relatives indicated a preference for naming as 
guardian a vietnam veteran like sadler 
sadler a former member of the armys special forces unit wrote 
and performed the ballad of the green berets in 1965 in honor of 
the unit he since has written a series of books on military themes 
he was interviewed by donnelly at southwest general hospital in 
suburban middleburg heights on monday the responses were 
confusing said donnelly 
the 48yearold sadler who has a home in suburban nashville 
repeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told the 
correct date and could name only two of his three children the 
judge said 
sadler was shot in the head last year in guatemala city where he 
had lived for five years the circumstances of the shooting have 
never been disclosed 
psychologist gintautas z sabataitis testified that sadler was 
competent but severely limited in his abilities and needed a 
guardian

students from the soviet union the united states 
western europe and africa today sent a letter to chinese authorities 
accusing them of racism 
a group of african students mailed another letter to all african 
embassies in beijing charging african countries have ordered their 
students to stay in china even though the students want to leave 
an african diplomat denied the claim 
attached to the african students letter was a separate protest 
note in which 44 african students from nanking demanded their 
countries let them go home 
the letterwriting campaign follows a brawl between african 
students and chinese on christmas eve in nanking 
official chinese reports said 11 chinese and two africans were 
hurt in the fighting at hehai university chinese students say the 
fight began when two chinese women refused to identify themselves as 
they entered the university with two african men african students 
say it started with chinese students and teachers attacking african 
students for no reason 
in the letter to authorities 140 foreign students from about 35 
countries including many black african countries australia and 
japan accused chinese officials of planning the hehai university 
brawl and stagemanaging subsequent antiafrican protests in nanking 
the letter referred to developments in the first week of january 
which ended with 400 chinese police raiding a guest house outside 
nanking 
many of us were beaten some with electric prods while all of 
us were restricted phone calls visits from our diplomats or friends 
and the freedom to leave said the letter we were treated like 
prisoners as if we were guilty 
in the letter to their embassies african students said their 
countries have begun to threaten and order their students to go to 
school against the initial demand of the students hundreds of 
african students in nanking and beijing remain on strike 
the letter called on the goverments to let their students go home 
we could not understand how the diplomatic corps would seek to 
sacrifice its students for a racisminfested friendship with 
china the letter said we should advise our diplomatic missions 
not to sell our birthrights for friendship 
kwadwo kwakye acting ambassador for ghana denied his country 
has ordered any of its 26 students to stay in china as students 
charge 
one ghanaian student alex dosoo was arrested after the brawl in 
nanking and jailed for a month 
he was released jan 24 a day before president moussa traore of 
mali the president of the organization of african unity came to 
china the organization had criticized chinas handling of the fight 
and later protests 
china initially ordered dosoo and two other african students 
allegedly involved in the fray out of the country but later 
reversed the decision 
one man alpha robinson of gambia left 
kwakye denied students charges today that african embassies are 
pressuring dosoo and boni lodovic to stay in china and transfer to 
another university both have said repeatedly that they want to go 
home 
kwakye said dosoo is free to return home 
few of the students have money to pay their fares 
more than 1500 african students study a variety of subjects 
ranging from agriculture to literature in china mostly on chinese 
scholarships

conchshell horns wailed and cymbals clanged today 
as beijings small community of lamaist buddhists began three days 
of mourning for the panchen lama their secondranking religious 
leader 
he was very good to us said one young monk at beijings 
yonghe temple the only lamaist buddhist temple in the capital 
most of the approximately 80 monks or lamas who live at the 
temple are mongolian but they belong to the same branch of buddhism 
as tibetans like tibetans they looked to the panchen lama as their 
highest religious leader inside china 
the panchen lama died saturday of a heart attack in tibet he was 
50 
he was outranked in lamaist buddhism generally called tibetan 
buddhism only by the dalai lama who has lived in exile in india 
since an abortive tibetan uprising against chinese rule in 1959 
the panchen lama is revered as the 10th reincarnation of the god 
amitabha the monks at the yonghe temple said they hope he soon will 
be reincarnated an 11th time but one added it is up to the 
buddha to decide 
the temple compound in northern beijing is a popular tourist 
place for chinese and foreigners but its huge red doors were closed 
today for three days of mourning 
inside redrobed monks and a few dozen tibetans who live in 
beijing chanted the thousand lamp offering scripture which one 
monk said was an ancient scripture traditionally read when someone 
has died 
several monks periodically blew on conchshell horns and beat 
drums and cymbals while the chantmaster laid long white silk 
scarves called hada in offering on an altar that bore a photograph 
of the panchen lama offerings of fruit and cakes also surrounded 
the photograph 
the smoke from hundreds of small butter lamps mingled with 
incense that rose threadily in the drafty wheel of the law hall the 
monks who sat crosslegged in front of the altar gulped mouthfuls 
of hot butter tea between chapters 
religious authorities have not said when the panchen lamas 
funeral will be held a government funeral committee has been set up 
headed by president yang shangkun and the state council chinas 
cabinet has ordered a memorial hall be built in tibet to house the 
panchen lamas body 
the body remains in xigaze tibets secondlargest city where he 
was dedicating a shrine when he died 
the panchen lama was educated from his teens by the communists 
and was their most credible spokesman to the tibetans he supported 
chinese communist rule in tibet and generally backed their policies 
however he spoke out several times against what he considered 
overly harsh treatment of tibetans and was punished for it in the 
1960s with nine years of house arrest 
the government has indicated it will allow an 11th reincarnation 
of the panchen lama to be selected traditionally it takes several 
years for religious authorities to identify a child in whom the 
panchen lamas spirit is believed to have been reborn 
generally the child is expected to be able to identify his 
possessions from previous lives and has certain physical similaries 
to his predecessors

greenpeace said a japanese whaling fleet 
it has been monitoring stopped hunting in antarctica today but a 
japanese official said the environmental group will not halt the 
fleets mission 
greenpeace spokesman paul bogart said the japanese ships had 
stopped harpooning whales in a a major victory for the 
environmental organization whose ship gondwana has been trailing 
the fleet for a week 
it looks like they are trying to sit us out bogart said by 
radio telephone from the gondwana 
they spotted a pod of 12 minke whales but sailed right through 
them maybe they are just tired of the hassles and are waiting for 
us to leave 
bogart said the gondwana today sent up a helicopter to harass the 
japanese whaling boats when the whales were spotted on tuesday the 
greenpeace ship collided with a japanese whaling vessel no injuries 
were reported 
in tokyo a whaling official said he had no reports the fleet had 
stopped working but said the ships may be forced to do so when and 
if it encounters harassment from greenpeace in a way that would 
endanger lives 
any such suspension would not mean that the fleet has stopped 
research whaling said hisashi hiroyama of the fisheries agency 
the fleet will not return home until it accomplishes its research 
mission in april he said tactics used by the greenpeace vessel 
were tantamount to terrorism 
japan says it plans to take 300 whales this year as part of its 
scientific research to determine the size of whale stocks despite 
a moratorium imposed by the international whaling commission 
greenpeace contends most of the whale meat will end up in sushi 
restaurants in japan 
the greenpeace ship carrying a crew of 19 is visiting 
antarctica as part of its campaign to have the frozen continent 
declared a world park 
another greenpeace spokesman peter wilkinson said the gondwana 
will continue to shadow the japanese fleet for another day or 
two then journey to the us base at mcmurdo sound which the 
group claims is heavily polluted 
then it will be fireworks he said

a federal judge extended his order 
allowing central american refugees to travel beyond southern texas 
while their asylum requests are reviewed but said he probably will 
revoke it in three weeks 
us district judge filemon vela however warned immigration 
officials not to let political asylum applicants overwhelm the area 
again and he said local communities should not have to bear the 
brunt of federal immigration policy 
im disturbed about the proposition that youre saying in 
effect its not my problem vela told attorneys representing the 
immigration and naturalization service at a hearing tuesday in a 
lawsuit against the ins 
the judge extended until feb 20 an order blocking the ins from 
requiring asylumseekers to stay in southern texas while their cases 
were under review 
but he added it is very likely that in 20 days this injunction 
will no longer be in effect he said he needed time to study the 
case 
a group of immigration attorneys sued the ins on jan 6 and vela 
on jan 9 issued a temporary restraining order blocking the ins 
procedure 
the travel restriction resulted in a squalid campsite east of 
brownsville where more than 300 central americans took shelter 
under cardboard and sheets of plastic 
after vela issued his order hundreds of immigrants fled southern 
texas many ending up in the miami area 
the only issue vela agreed to consider in the classaction 
lawsuit on behalf of asylumseekers in southern texas was whether 
the ins enacted the change without allowing time for public comment 
as required by federal law 
vela said he doubted whether notice and comment were required in 
this case 
prior to dec 16 the ins allowed asylumseekers who presented 
themselves to the agencys harlingen district office to travel on to 
their us destinations where they often were allowed to work while 
pursuing their cases 
the district on dec 16 began requiring applicants to file claims 
in harlingen and await decisions there for at least 30 days during 
which they were not allowed to work 
justice department attorney allen hausman argued for the ins that 
the new procedure did not deny immigrants the right to apply for 
asylum only changed the location for applying 
robert rubin one of the attorneys suing the ins said 
asylumseekers are better able to pursue their claims to refugee 
status in cities where they have relatives and friends to help them

prime minister yitzhak shamir today offered to 
withdraw israeli troops from some cities in the occupied territories 
if palestinians accept autonomy as a step toward solving the 
arabisraeli conflict 
it was shamirs most conciliatory statement yet on israels 
future role in the west bank and gaza strip 
at a certain stage when there is autonomy the army will leave 
several urban centers and be focused in some other areas he told 
reporters after addressing a group of visiting american rabbis 
shamir pointed out that a troop redeployment is called for in the 
usbrokered camp david accords which he supports 
the 1978 accords call for electing local palestinian 
representatives to hold peace talks with israel along with 
representatives of egypt and jordan 
there would then be a fiveyear period of autonomy followed by 
further negotiations on the final status of the territories 
the plo and many palestinians in the territories occupied in the 
1967 middle east war reject the camp david accords and the concept 
of autonomy maintaining these ideas are intended to circumvent the 
plo and contradict palestinian demands for an independent state 
shamir said the most crucial step in the peace process is to 
begin negotiations once we get to this stage positive results 
will come he said 
but he reiterated that israel will not speak to the palestine 
liberation organization and will not accept an independent 
palestinian state 
shamir outlined his views as paralleling the camp david accords 
which led to israels peace treaty with egypt 
the peace process will be comprised of two stages he said 
first an interim condition and this will include full autonomy in 
the second stage there will be direct negotiations without 
preconditions between israel palestinian arabs and arab countries 
shamirs government has been under increasing pressure to pursue 
a peace initiative because of international criticism of its strong 
policies in putting down the 13month uprising in the occupied 
territories and plo chief yasser arafats latest diplomatic 
initiative 
at least 370 palestinians have been killed most by israeli army 
gunfire since palestinians began their rebellion against israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
arafat made a series of statements last fall saying the plo 
accepted israels right to exist and renounced terrorism 
in december the united states agreed to open a dialogue with the 
plo based on arafats statements and several of israels european 
allies have urged israel to open talks with arafats representatives

communist party chief stipe suvar 
rejected demands for his resignation at a key party meeting and 
called today for an end to feuding between political factions 
the session of the policysetting central committee which ended 
today was marked by deep divisions between reformers and 
conservatives over ways to overcome the countrys worst economic and 
political crisis 
suvar a reformer is supported by slovenia and his native 
croatia which favor political pluralism more democracy and radical 
marketoriented reforms 
the conservatives are led by serbias party chief slobodan 
milosevic he has the support of poorer regions which believe 
marketoriented economic reforms will cause layoffs at 
statesubsidized enterprises 
after three days of quarreling the two factions of the central 
committee agreed to hold an emergency party congress before the end 
of this year 
the congress was called to solve the political and economic 
crisis and to choose a new party leadership for the next four years 
yugoslavia which is trying to repay a 21 billion foreign debt 
and reduce a 250 percent inflation rate is seeking to implement 
basic marketoriented economic laws the nation also is trying to 
cope with a drop in living standards and an alarming increase in 
labor and ethnic unrest 
on tuesday the military warned it will intervene if the crisis 
continues 
efforts to oust suvar were defeated tuesday when conservatives 
failed to force vote on the issue in the 165member central 
committee but the meeting ended in a deadlock over major political 
and economic issues 
the final decision on suvars responsibility was left to the 
23member ruling politburo but it was highly unlikely that the body 
will relieve him of his duties before his term expires in june 
we are divided on fundamental questions josip vrhovec a 
central committee member said late tuesday 
he said the split was so bad that within the communist party we 
already have two different clearly ideologically defined parties 
suvar said today the party must resolve its differences and 
implement the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult 
situation in the country and to enable the communist party to stop 
losing battle after battle 
the debate before his speech was broadcast live by state 
television 
we have to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking 
that only one truth exists and that all other opinions must be 
defeated he said in an apparent reference to the conservatives 
pushing for his resignation 
earlier suvar dismissed as pure fabrication accusations made 
by supporters of milosevic that he is biased against serbian 
interests 
the session was marked by heated exchanges on the question of 
suvars responsibility for alleged antiserbian statements made 
between his political allies mainly from the liberal northern 
republics of slovenia and croatia and milosevics supporters 
suvar also has drawn support from the central republic of bosnia 
and the southern region of macedonia as well as from some delegates 
of serbias largely albanianinhabited province of kosovo 
mihajlo pesic a serbian central committee member said that 
patriotic people and communist party members are asking themselves 
where this leadership which has lost confidence of the people is 
leading us 
can this leadership take us out of the crisis he asked 
the next scheduled party congress the highest organ of the 
ruling communist party was to take place in 1990 the extraordinary 
congress is to take place at an unspecified date later this year

lawrence livermore national laboratory 
said it has tested and interviewed employees to determine who 
brought a small amount of marijuana into its highsecurity plutonium 
research facility 
the building where scientists try to convert fuelgrade plutonium 
into weaponsgrade material and conduct other research has been 
closed since monday when a tenth of a gram of pot was found in a 
small plastic packet on the floor 
the building will remain closed until the investigation is 
completed said plutonium facilities manager arthur toy who could 
not say how long it might take 
the drug had been brought in past six security checkpoints and a 
computercontrolled security gate toy said 
the probe centered on 10 people who had been in the plutonium lab 
about the time the drug was found toy said the workers were 
interviewed by security and took voluntary drug tests but no 
suspect has been identified he said 
last year a congressional oversight committee accused the lab of 
failing to thoroughly investigate allegations of widespread drug 
abuse 
an undercover investigation led to the arrest of six lab 
employees in 1986 but members of congress and lab security 
officials said the probe was stopped before it reached sensitive 
areas of the lab including the plutonium building

the chairman of a house subcommittee that 
oversees federal courts says he will review proposed big pay raises 
for senior judges who do no legal work 
rep robert kastenmeier dwis believes he will have to look 
further into the senior judge question staff member mary dixon 
said tuesday 
dozens of federal judges who technically are semiretired but who 
do not hear cases stand to gain large pay raises unless congress 
rejects a government salary package due to take effect a week from 
today the associated press reported earlier this week that as many 
as a fifth of the federal judiciarys senior judges no longer 
hear cases but are in line for the increases anyway 
ms dixon said kastenmeier plans to review the matter soon with 
the subcommittees lawyer but believes he has at least a month 
to study it asked if kastenmeier plans an attempt to block the 
proposed raises ms dixon said he has not yet made such a decision 
kastenmeier heads the house judiciary subcommittee on courts and 
the administration of justice 
the pay package includes raises of about 50 percent for some 
2500 top federal officials including members of congress and top 
executive branch employees 
the constitution forbids lowering judicial salaries ms dixon 
said kastenmeier is studying whether the pay raises for the senior 
judges can be killed after next wednesday but before the bigger 
paychecks go out 
a republican member of kastenmeiers subcommittee rep carlos 
moorhead of california previously questioned the wisdom of raising 
the salaries of those senior federal judges who no longer handle any 
cases 
it doesnt seem fair moorhead said adding that the 
subcommittee may want to study establishing some minimum work to 
qualify for the raises 
older federal judges who opt for senior status qualify for 
activeduty pay raises even after stepping down from fulltime duty 
if those judges choose the other option provided by congress full 
retirement through resignation they keep for life the same salary 
they received on their last day of work 
most senior judges although lightening their workload help the 
federal court system cope with the increasing number of cases but 
records indicate that as many as onefifth of the nations 306 
senior judges including former chief justice warren e burger no 
longer do any judicial work 
burger who has not wielded a gavel since taking senior status in 
1986 is in line for a 60000 pay raise to 175000 a year 
salaries would rise from 89500 to 135000 for federal trial 
judges from 95000 to 145000 for federal appellate judges and 
from 110000 to 165000 for supreme court justices 
any attempts to limit or block the raises could be covered by a 
1980 supreme court opinion written by burger in that case the 
court held that although congress may not thwart judicial pay raises 
once they take effect it may do away with planned increases 
before they become a part of the compensation due

an argentine supply ship sank in 
heavy seas after running aground off antarctica and authorities in 
the region said oil from the ship had created a 10mile slick that 
was killing wildlife 
no one was injured in the sinking late tuesday of the 400foot 
bahia paraiso which began leaking diesel fuel after striking rocks 
saturday the government news agency telam reported citing a navy 
communique 
peter wilkniss director of the antarctic program of the us 
national science foundation said it wasnt known how many gallons 
of oil had spilled but that it could be an incurable disaster 
the foundation has said the antarctic could face ecological 
calamity if all 250000 gallons aboard the ship spilled 
the ship rolled over is lying on its side almost fully below 
the water wilkniss told abcs good morning america today 
this is a very enclosed area its a bay bounded by a 
glacier and some islands and our research station so if the oil 
goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline on 
the ice on the animals the organisms on the sediments he added 
the depth of the water was not immediately known 
officials from the national science foundation greenpeace and a 
us research facility near the wreck said leaking fuel had killed 
krill a shrimplike crustacean that is the main food of the baleen 
whale and a vital part of the antarctic food chain 
the krill are dying they are literally jumping out of the 
water the new zealand press association quoted greenpeace 
spokesman peter bogart as saying seabirds attracted by the krill 
are diving into the slick its a real environmental disaster in 
no uncertain terms 
bogart said the information was relayed by an officer at the us 
palmer research station two miles from the wreck a station 
spokesman talking to the associated press by telephone on condition 
of anonymity said leaking oil had caused a 10mile slick 
more than 300 tourists and crew were evacuated from the ship 
after it ran aground about 600 miles south of cape horn salvage 
efforts were hampered by 50 mph winds 
the ship was carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline and 
canisters of compressed gases to the argentine esperanza station 
near the tip of the peninsula the national science foundation said 
in a statement released in washington 
the tourists on board were to visit the research station 
wilkniss said 
it is an extremely dangerous passage to negotiate there are 
many islands there are icebergs at times there are many shoals and 
rocks on the water wilkniss told good morning america the 
ship according to the charts we have provided to our mariners took 
the wrong exit and entry to the station and it was not aware 
and was going too fast and ran on some underwater rocks that 
probably were not on the argentine chart he said 
the ship sustained a 35footlong gash in its hull and some 
diesel fuel began leaking washing ashore near palmer station the 
foundation said 
the accident occurred near two areas designated sites of special 
scientific interest under the antarctic treaty which permits 
international exploration of the continent the new zealand agency 
said 
before the sinking argentine officials had discounted a spill 
telam quoted argentine navy sources as saying the fuel it 
carried both for itself and the antarctic stations was in steel 
drums so a spill is practically impossible 
the 316 people on board including 82 passengers and 234 crew 
members were rescued by power boats and taken to palmer station 
most were then taken by cruise ship to the south shetland islands 
and airlifted to the south american mainland but 104 crewmen 
remained at the station said jack renerie of the national science 
foundation

a fortchoming book by edwin meese will focus on 
the reagan era in modern political history a spokesman for the 
former attorney general said today 
henry holt and co announced in new york on tuesday that meese 
has signed a contract to write his memoirs and they will appear in 
november 
the publishing company declined to disclose the amount of the 
advance that meese received and spokesman patrick korten said he 
did not know how much it was 
korten said meese has been actively engaged in the process of 
assembling material and scoping it out for the last several weeks 
the spokesman said he would not be assisting meese in writing the 
book 
i know that he has got somebody working with him but i think 
it is more research and assemblage korten said he really 
intends to do a lot of the writing himself 
it is going to be focused on former president reagan and 
really the reagan era in modern politics going back to his days as 
governor he said i would be very surprised if there is an 
awful lot in there about ed meese personally 
the henry holt announcement in new york said the book would draw 
upon meeses 22year relationship with reagan which began at the 
start of reagans political career in california in the 1960s but 
would focus on his eightyear presidency 
in a statement released through henry holt meese said there 
has been much written about the reagan administration both by the 
media and other members of his administration and about my 
activities within it now that that chapter is closed i feel a 
responsibility to tell everything i know about the operations of the 
eightyear administration 
meese who was named attorney general after serving as white 
house counselor resigned last summer in the wake of a 14month 
criminal investigation by an independent counsel which ended in a 
decision not to prosecute meese declared he had been vindicated 
but a report by the justice departments office of professional 
responsibility issued last month said meese violated ethical 
standards in his actions on behalf of lobbyist e robert wallach 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan still believed 
his longtime friend did nothing wrong 
the henry holt announcement said the rights to the book were 
acquired during a dinner meeting in washington in november attended 
by meese his wife ursula jack macrae holts editor in chief and 
meeses agent

saudi arabia announced today a quota 
system limiting pilgrims will remain in force during this years 
moslem pilgrimage to islams holiest shrines in mecca and medina 
following deadly riots during the 1987 pilgrimage which the 
saudis blamed on iran the saudi government declared only one person 
out of every 1000 people in moslem countries would be allowed to 
visit the shrines previously there were no restrictions 
hashemi rafsanjani irans parliament speaker disclosed tuesday 
that indirect contacts were being made to overcome the 
problems that led the saudis to sever diplomatic ties with tehran 
last april 
one of the key problems was the pilgrimage called the hajj 
rafsanjani was quoted by irans official islamic republic news 
agency monitored in cyprus as saying hajj must cease to be a 
hollow worship and should instead be turned into an active and 
exhilarating assembly for the islamic world to raise its issues and 
problems 
the saudi announcement distributed by the official saudi press 
agency said that in response to queries from islamic states the 
kingdom would like to reaffirm the necessity of adherence to the 
quotas 
they will continue to apply this year and in the coming few 
years until expansion and development schemes at the holy sites 
are completed it said 
irans 1988 quota was set at 45000 or onethird the contingent 
it sent in the two previous years that angered iranian leaders who 
ordered a boycott of that hajj 
in 1987 iranian pilgrims defied a saudi ban on political 
activities and demonstrated in mecca some 402 people mainly 
iranians were killed in ensuing clashes with saudi security forces 
saudi arabia said the pilgrims died in a stampede but iran 
charged saudi police opened fire on them 
in 1986 saudi security authorities unveiled what they said was a 
plan by iranian pilgrims to smuggle explosives and instigate riots 
during the hajj 
according to the lunar calender hajj falls in july this year 
every devout moslem whether sunni or shiite is obliged to make the 
hajj if they can afford it

that billy tipton was a woman 
donald ball director of ball amp dodd funeral home said tuesday 
that tipton who died this month of a bleeding ulcer was a woman 
ball said he informed jon clark one of tiptons adopted sons 
that his father was really female so clark would not have to 
learn it from the death certificate 
i was just trying to break it to him gently ball told the 
associated press on tuesday night i just didnt want him to find 
out in a public office its been a very difficult thing to handle 
the spokane county coroner was not available tuesday for comment 
the coroners office said 
im just lost clark told the spokesmanreview newspaper he 
said he learned the truth last wednesday four days after tiptons 
death 
no one knew said kitty oakes the woman that tipton had said 
he married in 1960 ms oakes who separated from tipton 10 years 
ago refused to talk about their life together saying tipton died 
with the secret and that should be respected 
the real story about billy tipton doesnt have anything to do 
with gender he was a fantastic almost marvelous and generous 
person she said 
hell always be dad clark said but i think that he should 
have left something behind for us something that would have 
explained the truth 
ms oakes told funeral directors that tipton was born dec 29 
1914 in oklahoma city and was raised in kansas city mo 
the newspaper said tipton apparently began appearing as a man to 
enhance his chances of success as a jazz musician

rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a 
musician 
tipton a saxophone and piano player performed with the jack 
teagarden russ carlyle and scott cameron bands then formed the 
billy tipton trio in the 1950s and played nightclubs throughout the 
west 
dick oneil who played drums with the trio for 10 years 
recalled some listeners made cracks that tipton with a baby face 
and a high singing voice looked too feminine to be a man 
but i would almost fight anybody who said that oneil said 
i never suspected a thing 
scott miller 27 tiptons oldest adopted son said tipton died 
broke and tired 
now i know why i couldnt get him to a doctor miller said 
he had so much to protect and i think he was just tired of 
keeping the secret 
you can imagine the pressure he lived with clark said who 
knows maybe thats what gave him the ulcer that ended up killing

syria and iran 
the peace pact did not refer directly to the hostages but i am 
sure that this agreement would help the release of hostages as 
quickly as possible berri said

be the umbrella for proiranian fundamentalist factions holding most 
of the 15 foreigners missing in lebanon

governments that might be in a position to render assistance in 
terms of securing the early release

it took five shotgun blasts from police to 
drop a 70pound pit bull named mongo after it terrorized a newspaper 
carrier and charged officers 
it sounded like world war iii mongos owner gale sneath 
said after police killed his pet in the neighborhood 
sneath described the animal as an excellent watchdog and simply 
mean to strangers police said it was the neighborhood bully whose 
nasty disposition prompted the city council to enact a strict 
ordinance governing pit bulls 
police chief ken sangston ordered officers to destroy the dog on 
friday after it chased 11yearold kara danko as she delivered 
newspapers in this town of 15000 located about 100 miles southwest 
of chicago 
wed had an ongoing ordeal with the same dog over the last two 
years sangston said tuesday wed had several citizens 
complaints and its owner was arrested on a previous occasion for 
letting the dog run at large 
we had reports of the dog chasing kids pedestrians the 
mailman and a newspaper carrier we knew the dog was vicious and i 
told my officers that if the dog attacked i wanted the dog 
destroyed 
the showdown came after miss danko was trapped on a screenedin 
porch holding the door shut to protect herself from the growling 
barking animal sangston said the girl called her mother who 
summoned police 
it had become a menace to public safety sangston said we 
sent out an officer and it charged my officer who shot the dog with 
a shotgun 
four times police shot mongo in the body only to see it get up 
and continue to advance it finally had to be shot in the head 
sangston said 
the new city ordinance requires pit bulls be chained and caged 
with warning signs posted to alert passersby of the animals 
presence police have issued no citations against sneath in fridays 
attack

been named as a suspect in the investigation of the 1973 crash of an 
italian military plane newspapers reported today 
zvi zamir who headed israels mossad from 1968 to 1974 was 
formally named by venice magistrate carlo mastelloni said romes il 
messaggero and other newspapers the newspapers said mossad was 
suspected of seeking to punish italy for what israel considered 
proarab policies 
although he was not officially charged zamir is being 
investigated on suspicion of sabotaging the c47 dakota plane the 
reports said 
the newspaper reports could not be confirmed independently the 
magistrate was not in his office when telephoned by the associated 
press 
the israeli government today refused comment on the reports 
concerning zamir who is now in charge of israels oil refineries in 
haifa 
however the israeli newspaper hadashot quoted avi pazner 
spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel as calling 
the accusations against zamir a bunch of speculation 
zamir was not immediately available today but his wife said he 
would have no comment on the report 
a few days before the nov 23 1973 crash the same military 
plane was used to transport several suspected palestinian terrorists 
to malta the reports said the palestinians had been arrested at 
ostia outside rome while allegedly planning to attack an israeli 
airliner 
the plane crashed shortly after takeoff from marghera near 
venice killing four italian military officials 
a month ago newspapers in italy reported mastelloni was 
examining a possible israeli link to the crash the reports said the 
head of mossad activities in italy in 1973 time identified as aba 
leven was also suspected of involvement but that he died a few 
years ago 
the inquiry into the crash was reopened in 1986 after italys 
former head of military counterespionage gen ambrogio viviani 
alleged in a magazine interview that mossad had sabotaged the plane

a military refueling jet that crashed on 
takeoff killing all 19 aboard appeared to veer away from a cluster 
of houses before tipping onto the ground and exploding in a 
mushroomshaped fireball witnesses said 
it couldnt have been more than 50 or 60 feet off the ground 
said skeet jackson who witnessed tuesdays crash of the 
hawaiibound kc135a from his back yard that left wing hit the 
ground and crashed just like these pictures of atomic bombs youve 
seen 
officials at dyess air force base outside abilene and at ki 
sawyer air force base near marquette mich where the flight 
originated said the passengers included spouses of military 
members retired military members and one child 
members of the air forces accident investigation board were 
expected to arrive at dyess today however their investigation 
could be hampered by the fact that no flight data recorder was 
aboard the modified boeing 707 said 1st lt john ames deputy chief 
of public affairs at dyess ames said he didnt know if a cockpit 
voice recorder was aboard 
the planes maintenance files were aboard before it crashed 
which also could hurt the investigation officials said some were 
duplicated but not all said capt paul bicking sawyers chief 
of public relations 
the tanker was scheduled to refuel f16s in the air as part of a 
training mission before flying nonstop to hawaii the spokesman 
said the plane then would have gone to andersen air force base in 
guam for a training exercise 
ames said it was unclear how much fuel the plane was carrying 
but added it was enough to complete the mission and make the 
eighthour flight to hawaii 
the flight manifest showed that 17 of the passengers were from 
sawyer and the two others boarded at dyess said master sgt al 
doster another dyess spokesman in addition to seven crew members 
four passengers were on active duty in the military four were 
retired military and among the four dependents was one child ames 
said 
names were withheld pending notification of relatives 
doster said it was not uncommon for dependents to fly space 
available aboard a military flight 
but ames said if they can get there by commercial jet 
there are certain regulations that prohibit civilians from flying 
military aircraft there are certain exceptions to that rule 
the plane crashed shortly after noon tuesday near the end of the 
dyess runway near us highway 277 six miles southwest of abilene 
the wreckage was scattered over 2 square miles air force officials 
said 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said initial 
reports forwarded to air force commanders at the pentagon and at the 
strategic air command suggested the problem occurred during takeoff 
it was toward the end of the roll and he apparently had no 
choice but to press on said one official in washington 
but he didnt have the power to get up for some reason added 
another 
the sources said the plane was carrying close to a full load of 
fuel what the air force calls a heavy load totaling 155000 
pounds 
kenneth fowler who witnessed the crash from his home near the 
south end of the runway said he sensed disaster when he first saw 
the plane 
he said he watched in horror through his kitchen window as the 
airplane struggled to get airborne before it ran off the end of 
the runway 
fowler said he knew the pilot was in trouble even before he saw 
the plane 
ive been watching these dudes out here for three years and you 
get used to the sound he said right then i said to myself 
hes not going to make it 
jackson said he thought the pilot tried to steer the jet away 
from his home and about a dozen mobile homes the homes are a few 
hundred yards from the crash site and west of the runway 
he just turned it back to the east jackson said 
witness vernon wright 19 said the planes crew never got it 
off the ground the first thing i saw was just the mushroom of 
the smoke 
the plane came to rest at about a 45degree angle a charred wing 
tipped toward the sky grass fires sparked by the crash burned for 
more than an hour 
the maintenance record for the kc135a powered by four pratt amp 
whitney jet engines was not yet available said lt col george 
peck a spokesman at strategic air command headquarters at omaha 
neb 
ames said the plane that crashed had been in service since 1963 
and was still carrying its original engines

the defense minister said today the government will 
allow the united states to test an advanced unarmed cruise missile 
over canada 
this testing is an important canadian contribution to the 
effectiveness of natos strategic deterrent defense minister bill 
mcknight said in a statement 
the missile known as agm129a is more advanced than us 
airlaunched cruise missiles now tested in canada using stealth 
technology the missile is better able to avoid detection 
during the tests the missile will be attached to a b52 aircraft 
which will take off from and return to its base in the united states 
without landing in canada 
opponents of the test argue the missile could be used as a first 
strike weapon 
officials from canadas defense and external affairs departments 
told reporters today the new missile is only intended as a deterrent 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity also said the 
missile does not represent a major change in technology they 
compared the modifications to those in car models from one year to 
the next 
the missile is believed to have greater accuracy and an increased 
range mcknight said tests are expected to be conducted before march 
31 
in explaining the decision to allow the tests mcknight said the 
warsaw pact already has a significant and improving cruise missile 
capability 
we support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction a process that 
can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from 
equivalent positions he said 
under a 1983 agreement canada allows the united states to 
conduct as many as six tests a year of the airlaunched cruise 
missiles 
gordon flowers executive director of the canadian peace 
congress doesnt think the government decision reflects canadian 
feelings 
i think the general trend in canada would prefer to see a 
canadian government thats working for disarmament and not testing 
new weapons systems he said today after the announcement was made

portland maine press herald on pay raises for retired federal 
judges 
the federal judiciary badly needs its senior judges judges who 
choose to stay actively at work after reaching retirement age 
but what the judiciary doesnt need are senior judges like former 
chief justice warren e burger who continue to draw full salary for 
doing nothing 
an estimated 20 percent of all senior judges including burger 
continue to draw full salary while doing no work their idleness is 
enriching to them not us 
in burgers case he receives 115000 a year that salary is due 
to rise to 175000 in february unless congress disapproves had 
he retired when he left the court in 1986 his pension would be 
108400 
burgers record of all play and no work since he took senior 
status will dampen public enthusiasm for a pay increase thats 
unfortuanate a pay boost is badly needed 
burger and other senior judges who draw full pay for doing 
nothing should be required to retire after all if they refuse to 
work why should we pay them

carlsbad nm currentargus on congressional pay raises 
is it any wonder that the american people have a general distaste 
for politics and politicians it is a twoway street politicians 
hold us in low esteem they figure us for suckers 
case in point of course is the pay raise house and senate 
members are about to accept heres the line they expect us to 
swallow they really dont want this money they really dont and 
gosh darned it if there was any way they could stop it well by 
golly they sure would 
hey guys in the words of a famous philosopher sit on it were 
not buying anymore weve been through it before remember 1987 the 
senate voted 88 to 6 against a 12000 increase the house followed 
suit haranguing against this needless salary boost and rejecting 
it in a voice vote 
however by golly all of this humble breastbeating took place 
after the raises were already in effect and it was too late to 
reject them

largely for that reason we dont think leaders of national 
womens groups should write off the era as a longterm goal as some

the seattle times on the border ditch 
waging war against drugs and illegal immigration with a fourmile 
drainage ditch on the usmexican border is an act of desperation 
with an improbable chance of success 
history suggests that fortified barriers seldom stop invading 
armies or discourage determined people in pursuit of economic or 
political freedom 
a texmex version of a maginot line will not deter desperate 
people who think a better life awaits them the only way to tarnish 
the gilded dreams about the united states is to take away the jobs 
that attract economic refugees 
continued immigration reform and enforcement that puts a premium 
on punishing exploitive employers in inner cities on the farm or 
the forests attacks part of the problem 
on a higher political plane the us and mexico should explore 
investment and freetrade agreements that create job opportunities 
in mexico both countries could benefit 
securing our borders with a buried berlin wall is not what 
this country is all about

the record hackensack nj on the supreme courts rejection of 
quotas 
after years of unsuccessful pleading by the reagan 
administration the us supreme court limited the right of state 
and local governments to impose quotas to undo past racial 
discrimination 
the ruling which invalidates a richmond va ordinance setting 
aside 30 percent of the citys construction business for 
minorityowned businesses threatens hundreds of affirmative action 
programs 
in the richmond case the court was unimpressed that only 
twothirds of 1 percent of the citys construction contracts had 
been given to minorityowned business in the past five years 
thats a telling figure that shows obvious discrimination richmond 
is 50 percent black 
the court worries that such plans could breed the kind of 
discrimination once embodied in jim crow segregation laws or quotas 
that limited the number of jews at colleges the fear is unfounded 
in one case the main and only rationale is hatred and bias 
in the other its an honest attempt to correct the systematic 
exclusion of black and other minority group members from jobs and 
public contracts the richmond pattern should be clear 
president reagans appointees to the court have joined in 
rebuking richmond thats a message that will be heard in city halls 
and statehouses across the country and its the wrong one to send

the arizona republic phoenix ariz on federal pay raises 
all the switches have been thrown the signals set and the tracks 
cleared for the 50 percent congressional pay increase to be 
railroaded through in the dark of night on feb 8 
heres the plan after impassioned speeches about fiscal 
accountability and getting our own house in order the senate 
will vote overwhelmingly against the 45000 salary boost but over 
in the house the pay issue will never see the light of day since 
both houses of congress have to vote against the raise to derail it 
it will go into effect automatically 
if that scenario sounds familiar it should this is the same 
scheme used just two years ago when the democratic leadership 
engineered a 12500 congressional pay boost increasing lawmakers 
pay to the present 89500 
on that occasion the casey jones at the throttle speaker jim 
wright had the cheek to order a meaningless voice vote on the 
salary increase the day after it automatically became law the 
lawmakers dutifully deplored the shameful looting of the treasury 
pocketed the money and snickered all the way to the bank 
it is a perfect setup representatives and senators can boast to 
their constituents of their opposition to wasteful spending blaming 
their personal windfall on the salary review panel composed mostly 
of congressional appointees and capital insiders a panel they 
created in the first place to relieve themselves of accountability 
although public opinion polls show that 85 percent of americans 
oppose the pay raise and despite tons of congressional mail 
opposing the raise the big salary grab of 1989 is a sure thing

congress and other top ranking officials will apparently get 
their 50 percent pay raise opponents of the measure in the house of 
representatives are sure they wont be able to bring the matter to a 
vote before the deadline opponents of the controversial pay 
increase are ready to go ahead with house democratic leaders 
blessing with legislation to remove the major sources of outside 
income that present congressman the most chances for abuse 
the legislation would ban honorariums or fees that senators and 
representatives receive from special interest groups for making 
speeches at various functions a congressman can now fly in to a 
convention at the expense of some group give a 10minute speech 
and fly back to washington with a fat speaking fee up to 28500 
worth the ban would prevent these thinly veiled payoffs 
congressmen are going to find this new salary increase isnt 
going to sit well with folks back home the house and senate can 
only save face by passing outside income restrictions like the ones 
proposed and requiring members to adhere strictly to them

the westerly ri sun on education in the united states 
in 1983 the us department of education released a nation at 
risk a sobering assessment of education in our country 
the report said that american students were well behind 
students in other industrial nations academically that about 23 
million adults were functionally illiterate and that average 
achievement of high school students on most standardized tests was 
lower than 25 years ago 
the findings led to an unprecedented flurry of reform activity 
within 12 months some 275 task forces were formed to guide 
reform efforts governors and legislators in 35 states acted to 
strengthen high school graduation requirements 
perhaps even more importantly many school systems have 
undertaken fundamental reforms of ageold educational practices 
we have made tremendous progress in the past five years but 
the job is far from done 
we must continue to apply pressure across the board to make 
certain the educational reform movement keeps the initiative against 
the reactionary forces arrayed against it

los angeles times on gorbachevs domestic troubles 
the soviet unions new candor has prompted the public admission 
that the government not only runs a budget deficit but that its a 
whopper 
leonid i abalkin director of the national institute of the 
economy says that this years real deficit including borrowing 
will exceed 160 billion thats equivalent to 11 percent of the 
gross national product compared to a us budget deficit that is 
about 4 percent of gnp 
the deficit abalkin says ruins the economy for president 
mikhail s gorbachev it also raises the most troubling political 
questions 
for one thing abalkin says trying to reduce the deficit will 
force deferring until at least the mid1990s the major improvement 
in living standards that gorbachev has made a priority in his 
program to restructure the economy 
so far the gorbachev era has seen a net decline in living 
standards with shortages of food and basic consumer goods 
deepening 
as part of the effort to cut the deficit abalkin says about 20 
percent of current capital investment in the civilian sector will be 
slashed the prospect then is for things to get worse before they 
start to get better

well goodbye dali it was surreal man 
cheap puns yes but in contemplating the spanish artist who died 
jan 23 at 84 the mind is tempted down that strange and twisted 
path where the subconscious overtakes rational thought 
dalis dramatic version of modernism explored the 
subterranean workings of human perception 
he delved into dreams and raised to the surface and onto canvas 
whatever he found like that special sleeping life of the night 
they could be lovely visions or nightmares of abject terror it all 
lay in what we thought we saw or alternatively in what we did 
not wish to remember beyond those first few moments after waking 
to those who like their art plain and pretty dali and his whole 
genre seem crazy 
the critics may differ on dalis rank among the greats but there 
is no question that he was one of the true originals of the 20th 
century and that for possessors of an original dali partin is a 
sweet sorrow indeed

local officials are preventing the organization from training its 
british recruits 
sliwa accused london borough councils of giving in to political 
pressure by refusing to let the guardian angels use their premises 
he said attempts to train in public parks including londons 
hyde park were frustrated by police who accused them of creating a 
disturbance and ordered them to move 
it is getting increasingly desperate sliwa said how long 
can we continue this nomadic existence without trainees becoming 
depressed 
british police and some politicians oppose the new yorkbased 
guardian angels coming to britain saying law enforcement should be 
left to professionals 
the government last week announced it will temporarily assign an 
additional 80 police officers to patrol crimeplagued stretches of 
the london subway 
a legal briefing for guardian angel trainees had to be canceled 
tuesday night when one local council refused the group permission to 
use a hall sliwa said 
that was the icing on the cake i havent gotten mad up to now 
but this has made me angry sliwa said 
i have had people tell me that they have had meetings in their 
halls by people who advocate the overthrow of the government we are 
not a clandestine subversive organization but we cannot assemble 
we cannot train he said 
we have approached people who say they think it will be ok to 
use their hall but when they go to their boards they come back and 
say boy those people dont want you anywhere

the environmental protection agency proposed 
today the banning of a pesticide which regulates apple growth and 
increases shelf life because of a link to cancer 
the epa however stopped short of ordering the chemical which 
is marketed under the trade name alar immediately off the market 
because it said it does not consider the health risk severe enough 
for such action 
apple growers during recent years have sharply curtailed use of 
the pesticide also known as daminozide because of government 
concerns that it may cause cancer but according to epa and industry 
estimates about 5 percent of the countrys annual 
200millionbushel apple crop continues to be sprayed with the 
chemical 
the epa in action aimed at eventually banning the chemical said 
it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban within 90 days 
and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking alar off the 
market within 18 months officials acknowledged however that the 
process could take much longer if it is contested 
john moore acting epa administrator told reporters there is 
an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure to alar 
and the development of lifethreatening cancerous tumors in test 
mice 
moore said laboratory tests are not expected to be completed for 
another year but that preliminary results although at times 
conflicting showed test animals having cancerous tumors when 
exposed to alar 
the epa estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a 
result of alar exposure from eating apples and apple products as 5 
in 100000 but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young 
children because of their greater use of apple products 
moore acknowledged that the agency could seek an emergency 
suspension that would order alar off the market within months but 
he said the agency rejected such an action because of the continuing 
conflicting test data the fact that the tests have not been 
completed and because of the level of risk 
he said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected 
the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of alar exposure is 
at most 1 in a million and the risk for a child 9 in 1 million 
we dont think that the added burden of risk over the next 18 
months is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of 
emergency action moore told a news conference 
derl derr president of the international apple institute which 
represents 90 percent of the countrys apple growers said that the 
growers have significantly reduced the use of alar since 1986 
when the epa first seriously considered banning the chemical he 
said no more than 5 percent of the apples grown have the chemical 
which penetrates fruit sprayed on them

officials decided against installing a 
remotecontrol gas detection system for a milwaukee sewer project 
weeks before an explosion killed three men checking methane levels 
inside a tunnel a newspaper reported 
the milwaukee journal said tuesday that a memo showed that 
officials of the program management office which supervises 
milwaukee sewer construction decided sept 16 not to order the 
contractor to install the 12257 system 
the three men assigned to check the tunnel for methane died in an 
explosion nov 10 
the program management office a group of consulting firms was 
created to direct construction of a milwaukee metropolitan sewerage 
district 21 billion project that includes building huge tunnels 
for holding sewage for treatment 
the report said a sept 9 memo from pmo engineer chuck kennedy to 
barry doyle another pmo official asked do you think we should 
direct the contractor to proceed with installation of methane gas 
recorder we still have approximately 2000 feet of tunneling 
remaining please comment 
a handwritten oneword answer no along with the initials 
bd and jr was returned to kennedy on sept 16 the initials 
are those of pmo officials barry doyle and john ramage the 
newspaper reported 
philip santacroce a pmo official said the contractor on the 
project did not feel the safety system was necessary santacroce 
said the mining would have been more than half completed by the time 
the system could have been installed 
the contractor felt he had enough monitoring equipment in the 
hole that he didnt need this recording device santacroce said 
at the time we felt as long as the contractor felt he didnt 
need it we werent going to go ahead and direct him to put it in 
but santacroce stressed that the contractor not the pmo or the 
sewerage district makes final decisions on how to build a project 
and what safety equipment is necessary we never told him he 
shouldnt put it in he said 
the contractor sa healy co of mccook ill has a 12 million 
contract to build the 10foot diameter sewer attorneys for the 
company said healy will not comment until local and federal 
investigations are completed later this year 
in september patrick doig healys project manager in milwaukee 
wrote the pmo requesting its advice on whether to install the 
remote system 
a sensor in the proposed system would have advanced with the 
tunnel boring machine transmitting continuous readings of methane 
levels to an aboveground recorder doig said we await your 
direction he wrote 
an existing methane detector on the tunnel boring machine was 
programmed to shut off the machine automatically when methane 
accumulated to a certain level 
shutdowns occurred nov 7 and the day of the accident nov 10 
when the detector found high levels of the combustible gas work was 
halted and miners were evacuated 
but because the sensor was not attached to a remote recorder 
workers carried handheld methane detectors into the tunnel after 
each evacuation to check gas levels

backers of denvers livinginsin law which 
has barred unmarried couples from living together in some 
neighborhoods for more than 30 years will have one more opportunity 
to persuade the city council to keep the rule 
after hearing more than 80 residents argue over the zoning 
ordinance the council early tuesday voted 84 to let unmarried 
couples share singlefamily homes anywhere in the city a final vote 
will be held feb 27 
i just do not think its appropriate for the city to regulate 
whether you are married any more than we should regulate whether you 
go to church said councilwoman cathy reynolds who has fought for 
13 years to repeal the law 
councilman dave doering said zoning is to control particular 
uses of a dwelling unit not the personal relations of the people in 
it 
but councilman ted hackworth said the 1950s rule isnt 
discriminatory because unmarried couples are allowed in many areas 
we should stand up and say we stand for families and 
traditional values he said 
denvers law forbids unrelated adults from sharing a house in 
about 8 percent of city neighborhoods including some of the 
wealthiest 
last year 134 people were reported to be violating the 
ordinance said zoning administrator dorothy nepa

congress today he paid thousands of dollars in bribes to indian 
housing officials in order to get multimilliondollar contracts on 
shawnee and chickasaw reservations 
kraig kendall president of k amp t homes inc said he tried to 
get housing contacts through straightforward competitive bidding but 
was unsuccessful until he began buying gifts and giving cash to 
housing authority officials and tribal chiefs 
kendalls testimony came on the third day of hearings before a 
special panel of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
investigating contract fraud and other alleged corruption on 
reservations and among those doing business with indians 
initially i wined and dined them and gave them small presents 
like turkeys and hams kendall said of his experience with 
officials of the shawnee housing authority 
later he said he offered the chairman of the authority tickets 
to university of oklahoma football games and was persuaded by him to 
do the same for the chairman of the tribe 
after sending the two to the orange bowl with about 500 in cash 
and paid hotel reservations kendall said he received a contract for 
a 50unit housing project 
kendall described similar dealings with housing and tribal 
officials of the chickasaw nation saying he paid 94000 on phony 
invoices from the tribal governors construction supply 
manufacturing company in order to get 14 million in contracts 
kendall said his way of doing business is standard procedure 
among contractors working on indian reservations 
he also said that in order to participate in bidding for the 
contracts he made an employees wife who had an indian relative in 
her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company 
she was a housewife he said he said she never participated 
in company business except to sign papers when necessary 
on tuesday gevene savala a kaibab paiute indian from arizona 
told the panel she was made president and invested her life savings 
in a road construction company run by her mexicanamerican husband 
who funneled his business to a larger nonindian firm 
now her company savala asphalt and construction enterprises 
inc has lost the support of the backer and she and her husband 
are trying to recover her 90000 and keep their company alive on 
its own 
mrs savalas husband david did not appear before the 
committee but in an immunized statement read by his lawyer he said 
he had been urged to go into business for himself by his boss at 
arizona refining 
between 1983 and 1985 the company went from earnings of 800000 
to 10 million but in 1986 the companys backer arizona refining 
was sold and quit bonding savala asphalt and construction 
enterprises inc 
mrs savala said her companys revenues plummeted to 1 million 
leaving the savalas with big bills to pay 
her story was one of several told by witnesses before the 
committee which is investigating contract fraud and other alleged 
corruption on reservations and among those doing business with 
indians 
in his statement mrs savalas husband said i had no 
intentions of starting my own company nor did i have the means to 
do so 
however mr james bagley guaranteed that if i created my own 
business my income would at least double and promised that i would 
not incur any losses 
savala said arizona refining performed virtually all of the 
functions of his company including preparing bids for road projects 
when contracts were awarded to savala arizona refining would be 
the sole source of materials for the jobs he said 
i would appear on site to do exactly what i had been doing as 
an employee of arizona refining drive a truck and lay the 
petroleum products provided by arizona refining savala said 
but when arizona refining quit guaranteeing his company through 
its bonding savala had trouble getting contracts 
he was forced to cut back leaving him with high unemployment 
taxes for laidoff employees and high insurance rates based on his 
highgrossing years 
in earlier testimony jefferson begay a navajo indian who owns a 
construction company in arizona said most of his competitors for 
indian preference contracts are fronts 
they give him the indian a pickup truck and a salary and make 
him mr president bidding on indian setaside jobs he said of 
the relationship between the front companies and nonindian backers 
he said indians go along with the process because it is extremely 
difficult for them to get bonding on their own and without that 
guarantee from lending institutions they dont get any business 
richard james elroy an fbi agent who has investigated indian 
contracting said the problem of front companies is pervasive 
he said they are not prosecuted because the law on indian 
setasides is vague 
in most of the cases the participants violate the intent of the 
indian preference law but not the letter he said 
he said more specific legislation is needed to give prosecutors 
something stronger to enforce

recordcold arctic air trapped over alaska finally broke loose 
and barreled into the lower 48 states dropping a bitter winter into 
the laps of springlike northern cities in a matter of minutes 
temperatures plunged by nearly 80 degrees in a day with one town 
reporting a 23degree drop in one minute high winds preceding the 
cold front blew a toddler down a street in lander wyo 
the polar air outburst accompanied today by blizzards driven by 
winds over 100 mph stunned residents of the northern plains and 
midwest where ski slopes and ice festivals had been abandoned for 
golf courses and tennis courts 
the frigid air no longer trapped by a warmair jet stream that 
had strayed farther north than usual and left recordhigh 
temperatures in 64 cities tuesday promised frigid weekend weather 
for the east coast and as far south as arkansas the national 
weather service said 
were going to make up for the party weve been enjoying 
said meteorologist rick brumer in chicago 
the party ended quickly on tuesday as arctic air rushed into the 
balmy northern plains including nebraska north dakota and wyoming 
dropping temperatures to 10 to 20 below zero high winds and blowing 
snow knocked out power in washington state seattle got a rare 
snowfall in the worst winter storm in more than three years and 
parts of montana 
valentine neb reached a record high of 70 degrees and dropped 
to zero degrees within 10 hours the mercury plunged 33 degrees in 
one hour after the cold front passed valentine in russell kan 
which had the national high temperature of 84 tuesday afternoon it 
was 12 degrees this morning 
in a 24hour period beginning monday morning temperatures fell 
79 degrees at great falls mont from 62 above to 17 below zero 
the state braced for even colder weather today as the system 
continued southward 
its the coldest air mass in the last five years since 
december of 1983 said bruce thoricht a weather service 
meteorologist at billings 
in the town of cut bank about 100 miles north of helena a 
federal aviation administration official said the temperature 
plunged 23 degrees in one minute and 103 mph winds dropped the wind 
chill to 75 below zero 
it was a drastic drop really fast said glacier county 
undersheriff bill barron 
in lander winds gusting up to 86 mph dragged a 2yearold boy 
down the street said his mother pamela roberts who chased after 
him the toddler was not seriously hurt 
he fell and the wind dragged him along on his face said 
roberts 27 i was trying to hold him and trying to open the 
door 
in the plains ranchers worked to secure cattle particularly 
newborn calves in areas that basked in temperatures in the 60s 
tuesday but shivered in dangerous windchills down to 40 and 50 
below this morning 
its a shock to anythings system when you have a 100degree 
drop in temperature said tom scott executive director of the 
nebraska beef industry development board 
in another way the cold snap was good news for farmers who 
suffered through drought last summer and faced more worries for the 
coming season because of the dry winter 
given how dry it has been its better to have colder weather 
because theres less chance of evaporation losses from the soil 
said iowa state climatologist harry hillaker 
blizzards hit tuesday in northwestern minnesota southeast north 
dakota and southern montana cut bank had 5 inches of snow and 
helena 4 blowing drifting snow dropped visibility to almost zero 
in parts of montana and minnesota snowfall was light this morning 
in most areas but forecasters said more windwhipped snow was 
predicted in the upper plains and midwest tonight 
the minnesota state patrol closed a 50mile stretch of highway in 
the westcentral part of the state for nearly 11 hours through this 
morning and troopers tuesday night led about 100 stranded motorists 
the 10 miles from glyndon to moorhead because glyndon had no 
accommodations for them 
it was pretty treacherous going said dave haug of west 
fargo nd who drove the lead car in the convoy im just glad i 
got home 
snow also fell in washington state where snohomish and spokane 
got up to 5 inches 
two inches of snow were recorded in 24 hours at seattletacoma

by early morning in the region police said it was seattles worst 
winter weather since november 1985 when 17 inches of snow fell in 
the month 
where snow didnt fall high winds fanned a prairie fire in 
nebraska that consumed 8000 acres and burned several farm buildings 
but destroyed only one house 
the cold air had been trapped over alaska by a dome of extremely 
high pressure the barometer at northway alaska rose to a north 
american record high of 3185 inches of mercury the weather service 
reported tuesday 
the pressure was so high that the faa late tuesday restricted 
flights over alaska airplane instruments that use atmospheric 
pressure to calculate altitude are not designed for such high 
pressure and may give innacurate readings officials said 
before the warm jet stream shifted south and freed the arctic 
air hightemperature records were broken or tied in 64 cities from 
colorado to ohio and from northern texas into southern minnesota 
dodge city kan soared to 80 degrees surpassing the record of 76 
set in 1911 chicago climbed to 65 breaking its 1877 record of 56 
louisville ky hit 67 also breaking a 112yearold record 
detroit climbed to 60 breaking the mark of 54 degrees set in 1890 
grand island neb reached 72 and fort smith ark hit 77 
the upper air wind patterns are normally different than they 
would be this time of year said brian smith of the national 
weather service severe storms forecast center in kansas city mo 
normally we have the jet stream across the continental us 
its been further north weather systems couldnt move through 
finally he said today weve had a buckle in it 
authorities reported no deaths or injuries directly attributable 
to the cold however on tuesday the body of a man whose skiff was 
swamped by high seas and strong winds off the coast of southeast 
alaska was found on a beach 
the warmth that preceded the cold front was indirectly 
responsible for the death of a wisconsin woman tuesday aboard a sled 
that sank in a lake where warnings had been issued several times 
about untrustworthy ice

the judge in the irancontra trial of oliver l 
north said today he was considering a contemptofcourt citation 
against an abc news correspondent who presented excerpts of norths 
immunized testimony to congress on television tuesday night 
us district judge gerhard a gesell suggested the action 
appears to be a deliberate effort to obstruct the selection of 
a jury in this case 
gesell said that on the broadcast abc correspondent tim obrien 
took pains to tell viewers that if they looked at his broadcast 
of excerpts of testimony north gave congress in 1987 under immunity 
they would not have to serve on the jury 
gesell said he has not made up my mind as to whether the 
incident provides an appropriate basis for a contempt action 
obrien was not in the courtroom as gesell spoke 
i really am quite puzzled by it abcs washington bureau 
chief george watson said of the judges statement tim obrien 
reported fairly and accurately what has been said in public in 
public testimony by col north and last night we and other news 
organizations reported that in explaining the case and how it came 
to trial 
our only deliberate effort is to accurately and fairly report 
on the trial of col north watson said 
the judges comments underscored the difficulty of selecting a 
jury at norths trial 
immediately after gesells comments the judge disqualified a 
woman who was employed at a sears roebuck store in washington from 
being a potential juror in the north case because she worked in the 
basement where dozens of tv sets were turned on when north was 
testifying to congress in july 1987 
the woman said she heard something about north shredding 
documents but it was unclear from her answer whether she had 
actually seen those references as north testified or heard news 
accounts of it later 
defense attorney brendan sullivan said he shops at that 
particular sears store and that there are hundreds of tvs in the 
basement where the woman works in the housewares department 
later in the morning gesell added four other people to the pool 
of potential jurors bringing the total to 11 of the 50 the judge 
wants to have from which to choose 
one was a postal clerk who said it would be a financial hardship 
for her to serve on a jury because she was working parttime and 
would not be paid while she was absent gesell said he might 
intervene to make arrangements 
a second was a laboratory technician gesell brushed aside 
defense objections that the woman had seen north testifying to 
congress on tv but she said she had not heard what he said 
i have to take into account your client was on tv a great deal 
under all kinds of circumstances the judge told defense 
attorneys she did say she saw him but she did not say she heard 
him 
the third person chosen an army veteran of the vietnam war said 
he could not recognize north who sat across the courtroom 
the fourth was a woman who has been a pentagon mail clerk for the 
past 16 years who said she had heard north was going to trial 
but didnt really pay attention to what the charges were she 
said she had been on vacation in canada during the first part of 
norths televised congressional testimony in 1987 
meanwhile norths lawyers say any jury in the irancontra case 
should be kept in isolation for the entire time the fired white 
house aide is on trial which could be for five months 
a request to sequester the jury was made by sullivan on tuesday 
the opening day of norths trial as gesell qualified seven people 
to be part of a pool of potential jurors 
sullivan said that in the event a jury can be empaneled it 
should be sequestered immediately to minimize the potential for 
exposure to immunized testimony and to protect lt col norths 
constitutional rights 
at a jan 9 hearing prosecutor john keker estimated it would 
take six to eight weeks to present evidence against north while 
sullivan estimated it would take two to three months to present the 
defenses case 
north faces 12 felony counts including lying to congress in 1985 
and 1986 to cover up reagan administration assistance to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels during a period in which congress had 
banned us aid to the insurgents 
norths lawyers have said that no jury can be empaneled that 
would provide him with a fair trial because the former national 
security council aide later testified about his activities in 
nationally televised hearings before congress in 1987 
in that testimony north detailed many of his activities such as 
shredding documents and cashing travelers checks intended for the 
contras for which he is now accused of crimes 
there has been repeated widespread dissemination of lt col 
norths immunized testimony for more than 18 months said sullivan 
north appeared before congress under a limited grant of immunity 
meaning the testimony itself could not be used to prosecute him 
however under the arrangement special prosecutor lawrence walsh 
was allowed to gather much of the same information independently 
over protests from north attorney barry simon gesell on tuesday 
approved seven potential jurors out of an initial group of 54 
one of the seven a retired postal clerk said she paid as much 
attention to norths televised testimony as she paid to the three 
stooges she said her house had burned down and she was occupied 
at the time with itemizing household items that had been lost 
another potential juror approved by gesell has a son who delivers 
newspapers for the washington post simon objected that the woman 
must have seen headlines during norths testimony but gesell placed 
her in the jury pool after being assured that she would cut off her 
sons conversation if he ever starts talking about the north case 
an unemployed man looking for work as a security guard also was 
ordered into the jury pool he said he saw north on television 
during the congressional hearings but knew nothing about him 
simon objected to the selection saying that if he heard even 
one small portion of norths testimony which he very easily 
could have he should be disqualified 
in addition to charges that he lied to congress north is accused 
of lying to the attorney general about his role in diverting 
millions of dollars to the contras from the reagan administrations 
secret weapons sales to iran 
he also is accused of ilegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
by using a taxexempt foundation to funnel money to the contras

a new survey on a controversial 50 percent pay 
raise for members of congress and top federal officials concluded 
today that about 62 percent of the house would oppose the increase 
if it came up for a vote 
the survey by groups opposed to the pay raise was released as 
house speaker jim wright conducted his own questionnaire on the pay 
issue that left open the possibility of a house vote 
wright who had planned to allow the increase to become law feb 
8 without a vote in the house now says members can have a vote if 
they express that view in the survey but the speaker said he 
expected members to tell him what they already communicated 
privately they want the raise without a vote even if the senate 
defeats the pay hike as expected this week 
the raise would become law feb 8 unless both houses vote to stop 
it members of congress would have their salaries increased from 
89500 to 135000 
the new survey said 270 house members or about 62 percent said 
they would oppose the raise if it came to a vote fortyseven or 
about 11 percent said they would support the raise 75 members 
about 17 percent declined to state a position and 41 members 
about 9 percent declined to respond 
of those willing to take a position 85 percent said they opposed 
the raise according to the survey conducted by public citizen a 
consumer advocacy group founded by ralph nader the national 
taxpayers union a nonpartisan organization of fiscal 
consdrvatives and coalitions for america a conservative 
organization headed by activist paul weyrich 
a failure to vote on this issue would be a fundamental 
breakdown of democracy said joan claybrook president of public 
citizen 
wright said tuesday he ordered his survey to prove he is not a 
dictator preventing a vote but a leader who is following the 
private wishes of members 
while house members were sending their survey answers to wright 
senate opponents of the raise told the senate governmental affairs 
committee that the increase was too big and that the system was 
flawed by allowing it to become law without a vote 
sen gordon humphrey rnh said the system sets a bad example 
for young americans and commented what must they think of us 
when we run from accountability as cockroaches run from bright 
light 
a pay raise without a timely vote in both houses is stealing 
he said 
sen jesse helms rnc said he was worried about congress 
reputation because people all over the united states are saying 
theyre a bunch of crooks 
but committee member ted stevens ralaska said the raise was 
needed especially for judges and federal officials 
what does it cost government to have incompetent people at the 
top stevens asked 
tuesday supporters of the pay plan urged that the increase at 
least be approved for judges and top federal executives even if 
lawmakers are unwilling to raise their own salary 
the raise will become law a week from today unless both houses 
vote to stop it senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
said senators will vote thursday or friday and an associated press 
survey indicates at least 88 of them will oppose the raise 
should the raise become law the house and senate would each vote 
immediately afterward on measures to bar outside income including 
speaking fees according to congressional leaders 
while opponents said they would try to have congress rescind any 
raise that became law they would have a rough time convincing 
colleagues to take such action once the speaking fees known as 
honoraria are banned lawmakers would be reluctant to accept the 
net loss of income if their raise and honoraria were taken away 
house democratic leadership sources speaking only on condition 
they not be named said wright acted on his own to order the survey 
with majority leader thomas foley dwash and majority whip tony 
coelho dcalif apparently cool to the idea 
he wright became the lightning rod for editorial writers 
and voters who criticized a novote strategy even though the tactic 
had quiet bipartisan support said one leadership source hes 
been concerned about the misconception the speaker is preventing a 
vocal majority of members from voting on something they want to vote 
on 
in fact wright told reporters over the past several weeks i 
have heard from many members on both sides of the aisle i have a 
pretty good idea of how they feel they support regular 
procedure a term that means a lengthy process that would make it 
impossible to vote by next wednesday 
but when asked if he would permit a vote should members surprise 
him and demand one wright said if the members want it yes of 
course 
coelho who is directing bipartisan negotiations on a package of 
outside income restrictions said the talks are focusing on these 
areas 
honoraria travel negotiators are looking at a time limit on 
travel for members invited to speak thus preventing somene from 
receiving a week at a posh resort for making a single speech 
however coelho said there would be exceptions for multiday events 
when to end the grandfather loophole in campaign financing 
law the loophole has allowed 190 house members who were in office 
as of jan 8 1980 to stockpile more than 39 million in surplus 
campaign money for their personal use coelho said there is 
sentiment although no agreement to allow members to retire with 
their cash at the end of their current term and then bar personal 
use of the money starting in january 1991 
restriction on outside income other than honoraria probably 
the toughest part of the proposal negotiators are trying to decide 
how to restrict attorneys fees book royalties and other earned 
income coelho said it was possible that some forms of income like 
attorneys fees would be banned altogether while a percentage 
limitation would be placed on outside earnings not under the ban

villagers in southern uganda are fleeing 
into the bush to avoid contact with a medical team monitoring the 
spread of aids and counseling victims of the killer disease a 
doctor said wednesday 
they think we are going to give them injections that will 
eventually kill them and that the injections would keep others 
sexually impotent for the next nine years said dr david 
sserwadda leader of the team 
aids is considered widespread in rakai the district 124 miles 
south of kampala 
the team is working on a joint program by kampalas makerere 
university and columbia university in new york city to determine the 
number of aids victims in the area 
robina kasada rakai district administrator has told the doctors 
to be patient because it takes time for the people to accept new 
ideas 
uganda has reported 6000 aids cases the highest number in any 
african country but the government is far more open than other 
african governments which are wary that high aids figures will harm 
a lucrative tourist trade

all times capable of exercising the duties of the office

nunn expressed chagrin tuesday after weyrich testified that on 
a number of occasions he had seen tower publicly drunk and in the 
company of women other than his wife tower has been divorced twice 
in other confirmation proceedings tuesday the senate approved 
the nomination of robert mosbacher as commerce secretary samuel 
skinner as transportation secretary and carla hills as special trade 
representative the vote was 1000 on all three nominations 
also tuesday the white house asked for a rare delay in 
confirmation hearings for louis sullivan to be health and human 
services secretary and said it had nothing to do with the flap over 
the nominees views on abortion 
tower said last week in two days of testimony that he received 
fees of more than 1 million for consulting work for seven defense 
contractors including such industry giants as rockwell and 
martinmarietta 
the committee has been expected to approve tower to head the 
defense department and there was no immediate indication that 
weyrichs remarks would change that 
tower a 63yearold texas republican served 24 years in the 
senate and was chairman of the armed services committee from 
198185 
members emerging from tuesdays closed session sounded 
unimpressed with the testimony from weyrich and another witness 
william jackson jr 
jackson a senior fellow at the fulbright institute of 
international relations said he had heard rumors about towers 
personal life from delegations traveling to geneva 
a number of allegations prove to be wrong said nunn who 
added that the committee is continuing to pursue all allegations 
tower refused to comment as he left the committees offices 
tower was not present when weyrich took the witness chair and 
uttered in public the allegations that had been the subject of 
rumors for several weeks while president bush was deciding on a 
candidate to head the pentagon 
over many years i have encountered the nominee in a condition 
lacking sobriety as well as with women to whom he was not married i 
recognize senators wives because i worked here in the senate for 
many years weyrich said i did encounter this on a number of 
occasions 
tower was dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing before 
his nomination was announced in divorce papers filed by his second 
wife lilla burt cummings tower was accused of marital 
misconduct 
bush has defended tower saying an fbi background check found 
nothing that would prevent him from serving as defense secretary 
when he announced the nomination he dismissed a lot of rumors that 
proved to be groundless 
elsewhere on capitol hill republicans and democrats joined in 
praising the three bush administration appointments they approved 
tuesday 
mosbacher is a longtime friend of bushs who raised millions of 
dollars for the republicans in last years campaign 
ms hills was the secretary of housing and urban development 
during the ford administration during the mid1970s and has 
practiced law in washington since 
skinner was the chairman of the regional transportation authority 
of northeastern illinois which includes the mass transit system 
serving chicago he is also a political ally of illinois gov james 
thompson and served as a campaign aide in bushs bid for the white 
house 
discussing the request to delay the sullivan hearing white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration has asked for 
more time for more background checks 
sullivan upset antiabortion leaders twice in recent weeks when 
remarks attributed to him indicated he was not an adamant foe of 
abortion

president bush said wednesday he will nominate 
conservative federal appeals judge kenneth w starr to be solicitor 
general the governments chief representative before the supreme 
court 
starrs willingness to give up his lifetime appointment on the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia was seen 
in legal circles as a good way to put himself in the running for a 
future nomination to the supreme court 
following a similar route thurgood marshall gave up a federal 
judgeship to become solicitor general in 1965 and two years later 
he was named by lyndon b johnson to the high court 
at 42 starr is regarded by many courthouse observers as too 
young to want to spend the rest of his career on the dc circuit 
however there may be political risks in the solicitors job if 
starr eventually wants to go to the high court 
as solicitor general starr likely would be the person to urge 
the high court to overturn its 1973 abortionrights decision a 
position that could elicit strong opposition from proabortion 
forces if he is later nominated as a justice 
starr was a clerk for former chief justice warren e burger and 
later a partner with the los angeles law firm of gibson dunn amp 
crutcher he served as counselor to thenattorney general william 
french smith from 1981 until his appointment to the dc appeals 
court in 1983 
the solicitor general is the governments chief appeals lawyer 
arguing cases before the supreme court and deciding whether to 
appeal lower court decisions against federal agencies 
if confirmed by the senate starr would succeed charles fried 
who resigned to return to harvard university law school

a sudanese rebel leader met with state 
department officials recently as part of a us effort to end 
sudans civil war that has left millions in danger of starvation 
officials said wednesday 
mansour khalid who serves as the foreign envoy of the sudanese 
peoples liberation army arrived in washington last week and asked 
to meet with representatives of president bushs new administration 
state department spokesman charles redman said 
khalid spoke on the telephone with officials of the national 
security council said white house officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity he also met with julia taft who heads the us 
governments foreign disaster assistance program and has been 
pressing both sides to allow relief convoys safe passage from kenya 
into famine areas said a state department official also speaking 
only on condition he not be named 
redman said that khalid has been here before and that his 
meetings did not reflect a change in us policy khalid has said he 
knows bush from the days both represented their governments at the 
united nations in 1971 and 1972 
until recently the us government had carefully avoided taking 
sides in sudan angering congressional critics who charged that the 
state department was allowing foreign policy considerations to 
overrule humanitarian needs congressional delegations to sudan in 
recent weeks have been told that as many as 500000 sudanese died 
last year of hunger 
in recent months us officials have been taking a slightly more 
critical approach toward the sudanese government of sadiq mahdi 
after he refused to support a tentative ceasefire pact signed by 
one party in his coalition government mahdi has been pressured by 
moslem fundamentalists in his government to reject any pact with the 
predominantly christian and animist rebels 
the united states has been urging the ethiopianbacked spla and 
the government of mahdi to negotiate an end to their fiveyear war 
and to allow foreign relief supplies to reach starving sudanese in 
the southern part of the country 
the sudanese government has supported past us discussions with 
the rebel group and was informed of the meetings with khalid said 
one us official he said the two sides in sudan are also talking 
with each other 
in an effort to bring pressure on mahdi us diplomats in 
ethiopia have been talking more frequently to spla representatives 
and the united states has also been urging the soviet union to get 
involved in efforts to end the war 
the united states enjoyed military basing rights and close ties 
with the sudanese government of gaafar nimeiri but relations with 
sudan deteriorated after he was deposed in a 1985 coup

million students out of schools and universities throughout the

a worksheet of calculations by admiral 
robert e peary provides no evidence he faked his claim of reaching 
the north pole in 1909 but doesnt end the debate on whether he 
actually reached his destination the head of a foundation hired by 
the national geographic society announced today 
retired rear adm thomas d davies president of the navigation 
foundation presented a new interpretation of a single sheet of 
pearys handwritten navigational notes 
baltimore astronomer and historian dennis rawlins in a 1970 
article and a 1973 book had argued that peary faked his claim to 
have discovered the pole most recently in october he cited the 
worksheet as further evidence of fraud 
davies said the piece of paper provides no evidence peary 
faked his claim 
but he added this worksheet says absolutely nothing about 
whether peary reached the pole he said debate about peary will 
continue as the foundation reviews other pieces of data from the 
expedition in its investigation 
davies said three experts evaluating the single document only 
found the calculations are not from 1909 as believed from the 
envelope in which they were found but from an earlier polar 
expedition made in 1906 
he said rawlins sensational claims are not proved by the 
calculations 
further davies said that one set of numbers that rawlins 
interpreted as compass readings taken as part of celestial 
observations were actually serial numbers found on the face of a 
chronometer taken on the polar expedition 
gilbert m grosvenor president of the national geographic 
society attacked rawlins claim that peary deliberately faked his 
results 
suggesting peary might not have reached the pole is one thing 
declaring him a fraud is another grosvenor said 
grosvenor said that in commissioning davies and the foundation to 
carry out the study i told him let the chips fall where they 
may 
national geographic previously asked wally herbert a british 
polar explorer to investigate pearys claims herbert published an 
article last year saying he found that peary was 30 to 60 nautical 
miles off course 
rawlins earlier had found peary came no closer than 121 miles but 
because of difficult conditions and low supplies felt pressured to 
say he had discovered the north pole

newspapers on wednesday criticized the 
nomination of natan sharansky as israels next un ambassador 
saying the appointment of the human rights activist and former 
soviet prisoner could hurt relations with moscow 
senior israeli officials who announced sharanskys candidacy 
tuesday expressed hope that sharanskys popularity would help boost 
israels image which has suffered during the 13month palestinian 
uprising 
but leading israeli newspapers said sharansky is not the right 
man for the job 
they cited sharanskys lack of experience in israel and said the 
appointment of a man convicted of antisoviet espionage would offend 
moscow which only recently began to improve ties with israel after 
a 20year diplomatic break 
the appointment of sharansky 41 would have to be approved by 
finance minister shimon peres head of the leftleaning labor party 
and by the coalition cabinet 
two israeli newspapers quoted unidentified state department 
officials as warning against derailing efforts to restore ties with 
moscow by giving sharansky such a highranking diplomatic post 
sharansky has barely managed to become rooted in the countrys 
landscape and hasnt yet found his proper place in israeli 
society said the masscirculation daily yediot ahronot 
the appointment is liable to be interpreted as a superfluous 
provocation of the soviet union the newspaper said 
other criticism focused on sharanskys personality with the 
daily maariv saying the appointment could prove risky because 
sharansky will not settle for serving as a mouthpiece he is an 
individualist whose opinions cannot always be foreseen 
the paper apparently was referring to sharanskys somewhat 
independent stand on the palestinian problem including his meetings 
with proplo figures in the occupied lands 
a popular columnist for the haaretz daily compared the sharansky 
designation to appointing jewish spy jonathan pollard ambassador to 
washington if he were freed from jail pollard a former us navy 
analyst is serving a life sentence on treason charges for selling 
classified information to israel 
the daily hadashot and maariv quoted a soviet un official 
identified as alexander dinisov as saying sharanskys appointment 
will not cause any friction between israel and the soviet union 
in moscow the deputy head of the soviet foreign ministrys press 
center vadim perfilyev said the issue is a matter of israels 
internal affairs 
sharansky the symbol of the soviet jewry emigration struggle 
came to israel in 1986 after an eastwest prisoner exchange that 
freed him from jail in the soviet union where he served nine years 
on espionage charges western observers believe the espionage charge 
was in fact punishment for his political views 
sharansky dodged reporters questions wednesday asked about the 
reported appointment he said no comment no comment as he left 
a jerusalem hotel after addressing north american rabbis 
after the speech one of the rabbis addressed sharansky as mr 
ambassador sharansky smiled and said im glad you accept that 
im the ambassador of soviet jews here in israel

testify the prosecution opposed immunity 
rother was left behind by a truck assigned to pick up road guides

the us department of energy today agreed to 
pay for an accelerated 456 million cleanup of buried nuclear waste 
at its idaho national engineering laboratory gov cecil andrus 
announced today 
the agreement came more than three months after the governor 
closed idahos borders to temporary storage of nuclear waste 
at a news conference andrus said negotiations with doe since the 
oct 19 ban led to the commitment to the 5year cleanup before the 
talks began the department planned to spend only 296 million 
through fiscal year 1991 
this is a tremendous step forward in the effort to completely 
remove years of accumulated buried waste andrus said the 
departments commitment of significant new resources indicates that 
doe understands how important cleanup is to idaho and to the 
nation 
however the governor said he will not reconsider his ban on 
waste shipments until legislation is introduced in congress to begin 
the land withdrawal process necessary to open the does permanent 
storage site near carlsbad nm 
until that time the borders remain closed andrus said 
about 2 million cubic feet of transuranic lowlevel radioactive 
and other hazardous wastes buried beneath the laboratory some of it 
since the 1950s 
some cleanup work has been under way since 1987 when tests found 
contamination in the aquifer under the site 
andrus said todays announcement means the cleanup will be 
sharply accelerated 
the doe has agreed to spend 339 million on cleanup in the 
current fiscal year through sept 30 62 million in fiscal 1990 
and 899 million over each of the following four years the money 
is subject to congressional approval 
the faster cleanup and increased funding along with does 
agreement to conduct an epidemiology study around the lab and its 
initiation of land withdrawal action on the plant in new mexico 
means three of andrus four conditions for reassessing his ban on 
waste shipments have been met 
the governor who previously blasted doe for failing to keep 
repeated promises to clean up the laboratory said he was confident 
he could trust the department to follow through on its latest 
commitment 
there are plenty of opportunities for the state of idaho to see 
the doe keeps its word this time andrus said mentioning some 
unspecified cards that have not been played yet 
laboratory manager don ofte said research is under way to find 
the safest and most effective ways to get to the buried waste but 
he said it may be two or three years before the first shipments 
begin leaving the site

line at a gasoline station officials said two people were killed 
and three injured but witnesses said at least eight pople died and 
35 were injured

defected to the insurgents during rebel assaults over the weekend 
and two helicopter gunships were destroyed at the military airport

convoy pulled out of the afghan capital on wednesday and headed up 
the salang highway the only route leading to the soviet border 
the spokesman who identified himself only as hamad said tanks 
and trucks carrying from 10 to 50 soldiers each moved through a 
checkpoint about two miles north of kabul about 6 am 
he said the soldiers seemed happy to be on their way home they 
were smiling and they were smiling and waving the spokesman said 
about two miles farther north moslem rebels fighting to oust the 
sovietbacked government of president najib bombarded the convoy 
with rockets 
because of the shelling afghan soldiers refused to allow anyone 
past the checkpoint without permission from the interior ministry 
the mountainous 260mile road has been the scene of heavy 
fighting between soviet and afghan forces and the ussupported 
rebels based in pakistan 
under a unsponsored agreement signed in april the 115000 
soviet troops sent into afghanistan to prop up the marixst 
government in late 1979 are to be gone by feb 15 western and

in afghanistan

over outposts along the perimeter road around kabul to the afghan 
forces 
lt gen boris gromov the commander of the soviet troops in 
afghanistan said tuesday he is confident the afghans can hold onto 
the salang highway and the key mountain pass that has been the scene 
of heavy fighting

to provide military assistance to afghanistan after the last soviet 
soldiers return home but the soviets have not said when that 
assistance will arrive 
an estimted 1000 flatbed trucks carrying rocket launchers 
ammunition and small missiles move along the highway every day 
afghan officers stationed along the road have said 
the soviets also use the highway to carry flour eggs kerosene 
fuel and other supplies to the capital where food and fuel 
shortages have been reported in recent weeks partly due to rebel 
attacks on convoys moving on the highway 
the emergency shipments have helped ease the long lines that 
formed outside bread shacks most lines have disappeared or become 
noticeably shorter 
local officias say they have at least a threemonth reserve but 
one us official in washington said tuesday there was only enough 
to last a few days 
several diplomats and relief workers however dismissed the 
claim 
washington is either very pessimistic or they think we really 
eat a lot said one un official speaking on condition of 
anonymity however long lines still form outside the gasoline 
stations and stretch for blocks 
it was unclear how long the soviet tranport will continue to 
kabul where refugees from the war have more than doubled the 
population to 2 million 
packed buses many with people riding on top with their thin 
ragged shawls flapping in the cold wind arrive in the capital daily 
rockets are periodically fired into the capital two car bombs 
exploded this week and two suitcase bombs were found and defused at 
the airport several missiles also have been fired at the airport 
and at departing planes

surrendered large quantities of arms and ammunition according to 
qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for the hezbiislami guerrilla 
group

launched combined assaults on kandahar airport on saturday 
inflicting untold losses on the puppet troops and destroying two 
helicopter gunships the news agency said the insurgents attacked

vice president dan quayle arriving in 
latin america for the bush administrations first overseas mission 
said today that any effort by the latin countries to form a 
debtors cartel would be strongly resisted by the united states 
quayle speaking to reporters aboard air force two just before 
landing in caracas said the idea being considered by some latin 
leaders to develop a united front to deal with their common debt 
crisis is counterproductive 
we are absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors cartel 
quayle said our strong position is that a debtors cartel is a 
nonstarter because each country has different circumstances that 
should be addressed on an individual basis 
quayle made the comments as he flew here to attend the 
inauguration thursday of venezuelas new president carlos andres 
perez 
upon his arrival quayle caused a hornhonking stir at a busy 
intersection when he stopped his motorcade for an impromptu shopping 
trip at a small corner fruit market 
quayle ate a banana and sampled a guava and handed out pins 
bearing the us and venezuelan flags 
with some two dozen heads of state expected at the inauguration 
the third world debt drisis is expected to be a major topic of 
discussion among the leaders and when they meet with quayle in 
bilateral talks 
today quayles packed schedule included meetings with perez and 
with the countrys outgoing president jaime lusinchi and colombian 
president virgilio barco 
quayle indicated that he would be discouraging efforts by some of 
the leaders including perez to coordinate their tactics and 
demands for dealing with creditors 
the vice president said he phoned former president richard nixon 
for advice the night before his departure 
nixon as vice president in 1958 made a trip to venezuela where 
he faced violent antiamerican crowds quayle said they chatted 
about that 
quayle will stop in el salvador on his way home friday during 
meetings with political military and labor leaders there he will 
stress the need to curtail human rights violations in the central 
american country officials said 
he will meet with outgoing president jose napoleon duarte of the 
christian democratic party and with representatives of rightwing 
factions but not with anyone from the leftist party battling for 
power in the march 19 election us officials said 
one official said it would be awkward for quayle to meet with 
leftist presidential candidate guillermo ungo since he is a civilian 
ally of rebels fighting to overthrow the usbacked government 
the vice president will meet with representatives of the rightist 
nationalist republican alliance or arena whose candidate alfredo 
cristiani has led christian democrat fidel chavez mena in opinion 
polls with ungo trailing 
no official list of quayles meetings has been released 
but a state department official involved in planning the trip 
said he is scheduled to meet with the presidents of spain portugal 
brazil colombia and honduras he will also meet with a group of 
caribbean leaders 
one of the topics for those meetings will be the status of the 
usbacked contra rebels battling the leftist government of 
nicaragua 
in el salvador an administration official said quayle intends 
to have very straightforward conversations emphasizing that the 
administration is serious about adherence to human rights 
officials have expressed concern that continued human rights 
problems will make it difficult for the administration to obtain 
further us aid for el salvador from congress

the government on wednesday reported its chief 
economic forecasting gauge posted a strong 06 percent gain in 
december continuing a seesaw pattern that some analysts said 
portends slower growth in 1989 
the index of leading economic indicators has reversed course in 
each of the last nine months showing little forward momentum 
decembers increase left the index at 1946 percent of its 1967 base 
of 100 up a slim 2 percent from the same month a year earlier 
economists welcomed the continued vacillation as a precursor to 
slower more sustainable growth during the economic expansions 
seventh year saying restraint would help keep inflation in check 
without threatening a serious downturn 
the economy is going to be slowing down but there is no 
recession on the horizon said economist david wyss of data 
resources inc in lexington mass 
wyss predicted that by the middle of next year growth would slow 
enough for the federal reserve board to ease its tight grip on the 
money supply since march the central bank has been pushing up 
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic 
growth 
samuel d kahan chief economist for kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said the reports sawtoothed 
performance tells you that there is not a boom building it 
suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the next couple of quarters 
but it most assuredly does not point to any kind of a recession 
the economy grew a robust 38 percent in 1988 but the slowest 
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the 
octoberdecember period when the increase in the gross national 
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent 
president bush plans to adopt his predecessors forecast that the 
economy will grow at a 32 percent rate in 1989 but many private 
economists are making more pessimistic predictions for the coming 
year 
in another economic report released wednesday by the commerce 
department construction spending shot up 25 percent in december to 
end a weak year on a strong note 
construction spending for all of 1988 totaled 4034 billion up 
just 11 percent from 1987 taking inflation into account spending 
actually was down 04 percent it was the slowest performance since 
the recession year of 1982 
economist james annable of first national bank of chicago said 
that while the finish of 1988 was surprisingly strong construction 
spending is likely to slacken this year as rising interest rates 
take their toll 
decembers increase in the leading index was bolstered by 
positive movement in six of the nine available components 
the biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers orders 
for consumer goods other positive business barometers were rising 
stock prices more orders for new plants and equipment rising 
prices for raw materials signaling a strong demand increased demand 
for business permits and growth in the inflationadjusted money 
supply 
the two indicators that made a negative contribution were a 
shortening in the length of the average work week and an increase in 
weekly unemployment claims one indicator the time needed for 
companies to receive deliveries from vendors was unchanged 
while the indexs recent waffling was seen by many as a sign of 
slower growth ahead annable said decembers strong showing suggests 
this economy still has a lot of momentum going into the first 
quarter of the year 
youve got all the factors in line to make this a pretty good 
growth year he said the economy is slowing but its not 
slowing down dramatically 
the leading index designed to show what direction the economy 
will head six to nine months in the future traditionally is thought 
to be predicting a recession if it declines three months in a row 
the index has correctly forecast all eight recessions since it 
was created in 1948 but also has falsely predicted recessions four 
times 
starting with the report for january its components are being 
revised in an effort to make the index more accurately reflect 
future economic activity

two men accused of planting a remotecontrol 
bomb that seriously injured a sheriff were hired to kill him for 
20000 federal authorities charged in court papers today 
the complaint was made public one day after the men one of them 
a former police officer were arrested in the bombing in december 
that nearly ripped off lafourche parish sheriff duffy breauxs foot 
and seriously injured a deputy 
the complaint includes an affidavit based on information from an 
unidentified source on the suspects marshall k mcclendon 42 of 
slaughter and john g tullier jr 23 of st amant 
the document does not say who wanted breaux killed or why 
we feel we have a lot more work to do said mike hall agent 
in charge of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms office in 
new orleans i would just say we definitely would anticipate more 
arrests 
mcclendon and tullier were to appear today before a magistrate in 
baton rouge for a bail hearing on bombing and conspiracy charges 
according to federal agents mcclendon is a former police officer 
in new orleans and baton rouge he also held a lafourche parish 
sheriffs commission and was involved with a regional drug task 
force there in the early 1970s 
tullier was identified as an unemployed instrument fitter 
if convicted they could get up to 25 years in prison and a 
25000 fine 
the federal complaint said the men collected 8000 and were to 
receive 12000 more once breaux was dead 
the complaint said the bomb was a box holding two pipes each 
loaded with explosives nails and bullets it appeared to have been 
detonated by a model airplane remote control device 
breaux 60 and parttime deputy daniel leche 62 were injured 
as they left a christmas party for senior citizens at the thibodaux 
civic center 
breaux noticed a paper bag by his car and pushed it with his left 
foot authorities said the pipe bomb inside exploded spraying him 
with nails and bullets 
doctors at thibodaux general hospital said breaux almost died of 
shock and loss of blood they reconnected his foot and predicted he 
will regain 90 percent use of it within a year he was discharged 
from the hospital last month 
leche was released after two days in the hospital

fourteenyearold staci elmer left for 
school wednesday tired angry and sad because she was kicked out 
of her parents home in a court battle over a rule barring children 
from her small subdivision 
there are no rights for the younger generation there are no 
laws for young people the constitution isnt for us staci said 
bitterly over a bowl of cereal at her brothers house im angry 
at my neighbors and sad because i cant stay with my parents 
she said it was hard making the adjustment to her temporary new 
home about six miles from the twoblocklong mobile home park she 
was evicted from the day before because deed restrictions bar 
children under 15 
it was scary waking up this morning i didnt know where i was 
at first staci said 
on tuesday pasco circuit judge wayne cobb rejected beverly and 
thomas elmers request to delay a jan 6 order he said if staci 
wasnt out of the house by 5 pm the couple would go to jail for 10 
days 
the judge said staci a quiet ab freshman at zephyrhills high 
school may come home for visits even for overnight but may not 
move home permanently until she turns 15 on april 7 she says she 
will move home then 
we have nothing against the girl its the principle said 
aline murray she is one of the neighbors who sued to preserve the 
adultsonly status of the tiny mobile home settlement on the back 
streets in this quiet retirement community we bought here with 
the idea of peace and quiet in our old age 
the feud began shortly after the elmers moved into the unnamed 
subdivision of 17 households in fall 1987 the neighborhood two 
short blocks of neatly kept homes is composed of retirees except 
for the elmers 
mrs elmer a realtorassociate admits she knew about the age 
restriction before buying but she liked the area it was affordable 
and convenient to work and school other residents she said 
violated deed restrictions governing placement of clotheslines and 
propane tanks so she didnt think staci would be a problem 
she was wrong 
all the neighbors hired an attorney and filed a lawsuit in may to 
enforce the age clause in august a judge upheld the deed 
restrictions and said staci had to go 
staci stayed 
earlier this month cobb said he had no choice but to find the 
parents in contempt he set a deadline for them to comply or report 
to jail 
the elmers attorney mary greenwood made one last bid tuesday 
to delay stacis move until midmarch after amendments to a federal 
housing law take effect outlawing age restrictions in some 
communities the judge rejected the request and scheduled a hearing 
for march 22 
i knew it would happen because the neighbors dont like me 
they would have done anything to get rid of me staci said 
bruce murray a retired law enforcement officer from pittsburgh 
was satisfied with the outcome if the deed restriction was broken 
he said it would open up the area for sale to anyone 
mrs elmer whose husband is a longdistance truck driver 
worries about the scars on her daughter 
in fact staci was so upset after the ruling she had her mother 
stay overnight with her at her married brother darwyns house 
this is hard on staci emotionally said mrs elmer 45 i 
cant believe people can be this cruel they didnt care if she had 
to sleep on a park bench 
if i had thought all this would happen thered been no way i 
would have done this to hurt staci but at this point i would not 
sell my house weve gone through too much

democratic party regulars on wednesday 
described incoming party chairman ronald h brown as his own 
man but there was widespread concern that his ties to jesse 
jackson and edward m kennedy would reinforce the partys liberal 
image 
i dont see him as jacksons man said sam shipley chairman 
of the delaware democratic party i see him as his own man i 
think most people see him as jacksons man but not the party 
leaders 
an associated press survey of state democratic party leaders and 
elected officials disclosed a wide range of opinion about the impact 
browns election might have on party fortunes 
they spoke as the chairmantobe prepared to head into the south 
on thursday on a trip designed to confront concerns of party leaders 
in a region marked by the conservative cast of its politics 
now unopposed for the party leadership post brown will become 
chairman at the democratic national committee meeting in washington 
on feb 10 the first black to head a major political party he 
emerged the victor in a fiveway contest that included three former 
house members and the chairman of the michigan democratic party 
brown joined jacksons presidential campaign in may 1988 and as 
his convention manager was jacksons principal negotiator with aides 
to michael dukakis 
brown also played a major role in kennedys 1980 presidential 
campaign and was general counsel to the senate judiciary committee 
when kennedy was chairman 
while many party officials said they were confident of browns 
independence doubts remained among conservative democrats their 
concerns were based not on browns views on issues but on his ties 
to party liberals 
he is jacksons man said john henry anderson the georgia 
democratic party chairman but he expressed desire to work with 
brown 
nothing is as bad tomorrow as it looks today he said 
louisiana sen john breaux chairman of the democratic senate 
campaign committee was one of the last holdouts for an alternative 
to brown 
but breaux said browns role as convention chairman for the 
jackson presidential campaign should not be held against him 
there were a lot of moderates and whites who urged him to take 
that job at the convention and be a moderator breaux said now 
i think the same people should be willing to give him a chance 
he urged brown to appoint a task force to address the concerns of 
moderates 
some legislative leaders voiced concern that browns selection 
could hurt democrats in local races a possibility most respondents 
thought unlikely 
i dont know ron brown said r clayton mitchell speaker of 
the maryland house of delegates i dont know anything about ron 
brown but people ive talked to are concerned it might hurt us 
mitchell said there was a conservative trend in the country and a 
lot of people are concerned were moving away from the national 
trend 
martin tandler a new york businessman active in raising money 
for democratic senate and house candidates said browns election 
may be a problem in that on a national level the democratic party 
has managed to either paint itself or be painted into a corner that 
represents the interests of minorities and women and disenfranchised 
to the exclusion of the middle class 
its a very positive step for us to pick a black chairman 
said john marino executive director of the new york democratic 
party thats because we dont look at ron brown as simply being 
black we look upon him as someone who can unite all democrats and 
put it together 
some of the strongest early opposition to brown came from alabama 
democratic chairman john baker who said he would consider 
boycotting national party functions if brown became chairman he 
said a brown chairmanship would be a victory for the ultraliberal 
wing of the party 
joe reed a black alabama democratic official countered that 
with that kind of talk by baker lee atwater the republican 
national chairman would not have a hard job getting blacks to join 
the republican party 
mac parsons an alabama state senator with strong ties to 
organized labor said browns election furthers the image of the 
democrats as the party of blacks and liberals 
unfortunately in politics once the image is created its 
awfully difficult to change even if the image is incorrect he 
said 
peter kelly a connecticut party leader said brown might have to 
take a step comparable to richard nixons move to normalize 
relations with china a step made easier by nixons long history as 
a fervent anticommunist 
ron brown comes from the liberal wing of the party and will as 
the saying goes have to go to china like nixon did kelly said 
the balls in his court 
gov roy romer of colorado met with brown last weekend and said 
he told brown the partys goals need to be redefined i meant that 
the democrats have to help to make a free market work and be frugal 
in spending 
romer said that while there was a perception that brown is tied 
to jackson it will be corrected shortly

construction spending depressed by a downturn 
in work on apartment buildings rose just 11 percent last year the 
weakest showing since the recession year of 1982 the government 
reported wednesday 
the year ended on a strong note however as construction 
spending rose 25 percent in december the commerce department 
reported 
spending for all of 1988 totaled 4034 billion a slim increase 
from 3989 billion in the previous year but after taking into 
account inflation spending actually was down 04 percent from 1987 
construction spending had been down 52 percent in 1982 or 81 
percent after adjusting for inflation 
samuel d kahan chief economist for kleinwort benson government 
securities inc in chicago said that while construction strength 
increased at the end of 1988 due to strong growth in personal 
income spending this year should be moderate as interest rates rise 
if interest rates do continue rising that should act as a 
squeeze on overall construction spending he said i dont think 
its going to be a banner year 
last years spending pace was depressed by slow activity on 
apartments a category that suffered from high vacancy rates and was 
still feeling the impact of the 1986 tax overhaul that curtailed tax 
breaks for construction investments 
in inflationadjusted dollars apartment construction was down 
139 percent to 193 billion last year while work on singlefamily 
homes rose 29 percent to 1036 billion nonresidential 
construction spending was down a slight 01 percent to 781 
billion while spending on government projects was down 04 percent 
to 658 billion after adjusting for inflation 
high mortgage interest rates have restrained construction 
activity in most sectors fixedrate home mortgages averaged 106 
percent last week up from 1016 percent a year earlier according 
to the federal national mortgage association 
economist james annable of first national bank of chicago said 
that while construction spending is likely to slacken later this 
year the finish of 1988 was stronger than expected 
construction has stayed surprisingly strong given interest 
rates and the upward pressure on interest rates he said they 
havent had quite as much bite as history might have told us 
building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
4227 billion in december the fourth straight monthly rise the 
25 percent increase was the best since a 28 percent rise last 
march 
for the month residential construction rose 03 percent to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2209 billion reflecting a 11 
percent gain in singlefamily home building apartment construction 
dropped 23 percent 
nonresidential construction rose 34 percent to an annual rate 
of 964 billion spending on government projects was up 78 percent 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 868 billion 
the monthly figures are not adjusted for inflation

a ban by the only movie theater in town on 
the only movie critic in town may violate a civil rights law the 
state attorney generals office says 
but the office is advising the editor of blythes twiceweekly 
palo verde valley times to work for an amicable settlement to his 
dispute with the blythe community cinema 
editor harold stanford said tuesday he has been advised by a 
deputy to attorney general john van de kamp that the theaters ban 
on his movie critic is probably a violation of the states unruh 
civil rights act an interpretation disputed wednesday by an 
attorney for the theater owner 
stanford said van de kamps office hasnt responded to his 
request that the state sue the theater on behalf of the paper and 
its parttime movie critic cathy monnett 
mrs monnett who works for the price of her tickets and who 
refuses to review rrated movies was banned from the theater dec 
14 managers said her negative reviews were hurting business but 
she has responded that most of her comments have been positive 
alan ashby a spokesman for van de kamp confirmed the office had 
been asked to pursue the case but indicated the van de kamp would 
prefer to see the parties settle their differences amicably 
we told him that the california supreme court held that the 
unruh act can be broadly interpreted to prohibit all unreasonable 
discrimination by private businesses ashby said 
los angeles attorney don davis brother of theater owner paul 
davis said he disagreed that the ban on the critic violates the 
state civil rights law because courts have ruled the law applies to 
arbitrary discrimination against classes of people 
if we eliminated all film critics by class or all children or 
all women that would be class discrimination and that would be 
arbitrary davis said those same court rulings say you can 
eject somebody from your establishment thats injurious to your 
business 
since the ban stanford has been sending mrs monnett to yuma 
ariz a round trip of more than 100 miles to review movies that 
will be shown in blythe a desert town along on the 
californiaarizona border 
theater officials said they offered to let mrs monnett return if 
the newspaper would run reviews by a theaterhired critic next to 
her reviews stanford rejected that offer saying the other critic 
would be pr hype in our newspaper

the state department accused the soviet union 
on wednesday of continuing widespread bombing attacks inside 
afghanistan charging that unprecedented destruction has 
occurred as soviet troops withdraw 
department spokeswoman charles redman renewed accusations made 
repeatedly in recent weeks against the soviet raids contending that 
the number of sorties continues to be very high its in a lot 
of parts of the country and included highaltitude bombing runs 
artillery and missile attacks 
the spokesman did say however that the united states welcomed 
the pledge by the top soviet general in afghanistan lt gen boris 
gromov that once the pullout is completed by the feb 15 deadline 
moscow will halt the bombing raids 
those kind of assurances are welcome and we expect moscow to 
live up to this public commitment redman said 
on monday redman charged the soviets with conducting a 
scorched earth campaign as their military forces depart an 
assertion that gromov denied 
while redman said he had no way of quantifying the casualty 
rates he said hundreds of civilians had been killed during the 
bombing raids 
and when asked whether he knew if afghan guerrillas were present 
in the areas targeted by the soviets redman did not answer directly 
the spokesman said that besides the bombardment directed in the 
area of the departure route there has been mass destruction of 
villages along the highway that links kabul with the soviet border 
and villages some distance from the highway 
the highway is the only land route home for red army troops in 
kabul and the krelim has complained that withdrawing soviet troops 
have been attacked by the usarmed rebel forces 
the salient facts today are massive soviet bombardment of 
afghanistan and secondly massive stockpiling of soviet equipment 
in the hands of the afghan regime redman said the fact of the 
matter is intensive unprecedented destruction in afghanistan 
redman repeated once again that that united states considers the 
bombing raids to be in violation of the assurances provided by the 
soviets last year in connection with the agreement signed in geneva 
outlining the soviet withdrawal 
to see here in the last weeks this just massive effort aimed 
at destroying even more of afghanistan and without question killing 
afghans it just doesnt seem to be what ought to be a policy 
followed by anyone at this stage of the game redman said

authorities eased a curfew here 
wednesday but ethnic tensions remain high in this republic that was 
the site of mass demonstrations before being hit by a devastating 
earthquake in december 
the military commander in yerevan in an announcement published 
in the daily newspaper kommunist said the midnightto6 am curfew 
would be reduced further to 1 am to 5 am 
the decision was made considering the stabilization of the 
situation in the capital and regions of the republic during the past 
month the participation of citizens in supporting public order and 
requests of residents the newspaper said 
a government commission called for speeding up construction to 
clear the debris and build new housing in northwestern regions of 
the republic stricken by the dec 7 earthquake which killed an 
estimated 25000 people and left a half million homeless the 
commission complained the organizations involved in reconstruction 
are bickering among themselves and making little progress 
also on wednesday the rev jesse jackson visited armenian 
leaders in a tour he said would help him determine what further aid 
can be provided 
the curfew in yerevan was imposed in november after at least 30 
people were killed in ethnic rioting in armenia and the neighboring 
republic of azerbaijan 
the streets of the armenian capital which a few weeks ago were 
dotted with tanks armored personal carriers and interior ministry 
troops were comparatively demilitarized this week 
only a handful of soldiers and one armored personnel carrier were 
visible on opera square the site of street protests last year in 
the most recent violence the square was surrounded by troops and 
military vehicles 
on lenin square there were no tanks although six armored 
personel carriers and a handful of troops were deployed at main 
government buildings 
armenian refugees from the violence in azerbaijan gathered 
wednesday as they have for several weeks outside the agriculture 
committee offices to discuss their fate soviet authorities say 
about 300000 people armenians who were living in azerbaijan and 
azerbaijanis from armenia have fled to their ancestral republics 
since february 1988 residents of the predominantly armenian 
region of nagornokarabakh in azerbaijan have been agitating to be 
made part of the republic of armenia armenians are predominantly 
christian while azerbaijanis are predominantly moslem 
people in a crowd of about 100 refugees said the government is 
refusing to give them jobs or homes they said they were afraid 
their lives would be in danger if they returned to azerbaijan 
i consider that its better to die here in yerevan than to try 
to live there said gena agabekyan an ethnic armenian who fled 
the azerbaijan capital of baku two months ago 
agabekyan who fled along with his teenage son daughter mother 
and wife said the government had given him the equivalent of 160 
for each member of his family but what he really wanted was a job 
he said he had worked in baku as a crane operator for the azerbaijan 
film committee but was fired eight months ago 
because i am an armenian no reason was given said 
agabekyan 50 
authorities have been trying to persuade the refugees to return 
to their homes but have met with only limited success 
yuri khodzhamiryan a deputy premier of armenia told soviet and 
foreign journalists the government was not forcing any of the 
refugees to return 
if they want to return normal conditions are created for them 
there he said but he acknowledged authorities were having 
trouble finding places for the refugees to live because most vacant 
apartments were turned over to those left homeless by the earthquake 
neither police nor the interior ministrys security forces 
interfered with the refugees who gathered to discuss their cases 
the crowd was peaceful with none of the shouting or banner waving 
that characterized the mass protests of recent months

racial slurs and obscenities 
spraypainted on two buildings and a fence at the lincoln home 
national historic site have been removed officials said wednesday 
its all been cleaned up right after we discovered it we 
began cleanup said acting site superintendent larry blake 
damage was estimated at 500 pink and blue fluorescent paint was 
sprayed monday or early tuesday on the carriage house behind 
lincolns home an adjacent shed and a white wooden fence behind the 
shed meters and an air conditioner also were damaged 
vandalism at the site is not common blake said 
usually its fairly uncommon because the springfield community 
has a great deal of respect for the lincoln sites as a whole so we 
dont really have a lot of problems with vandalism he said 
because the damage occurred on federal property the fbi was 
investigating blake said no arrests had been made 
the lincoln home the only house the nations 16th president ever 
owned was reopened last year after a multimilliondollar renovation 
in 1987 lincolns tomb in oak ridge cemetery several miles from 
the home was vandalized with spray paint five teenagers and an

the pentagon announced wednesday that the 
united states has decided to reduce the scale of natos reforger 
exercises in what one defense official called an attempt to lower 
the heat of political debate in west germany 
defense officials who insisted on anonymity said the changes 
would allow the united states and its allies to reduce the impact of 
field training on the west german public 
the defense department announced its plans to change reforger 
exercises in a statement wednesday while denying they were tied in 
any way to politics indeed the pentagons press release portrayed 
the modifications as an enhancement that would allow us army 
troops to train smarter 
pentagon sources said however the goal of training smarter 
would be reached by reducing the number of troops moved from the 
united states to europe for field maneuvers reducing the scope of 
exercise maneuvers by all troops including those posted to europe 
full time and relying to a greater extent on computer simulations 
to train battle staffs 
they can call this an enhancement if they want but were also 
trying to lower the heat of political debate in west germany said 
one official referring to growing complaints there about lowlevel 
military flight training and plans to modernize nuclear missiles 
we cant afford to lose public opinion to soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev and his pr campaign said another source 
citing announcements by the soviet leader of unilateral troop cuts 
if we can accomplish our major training aims and lessen the 
impact of our training on the populace then we should do that and 
if we can save some money given the budget environment back here 
and concerns about sharing nato burdens so much the better the 
source said 
in december gorbachev announced at the united nations that the 
soviet union would unilaterally cut its military forces by a 
halfmillion troops and reduce its conventional arms substantially 
the reforger return of forces to germany exercises have long 
been a mainstay of american as well as nato deterrent policy they 
normally consist of the largescale movement of army troops from the 
united states to europe simulating the type of reinforcement 
operation that would be needed to sustain western forces in the 
event of a warsaw pact attack 
last years reforger conducted in the late summer and early 
fall involved the deployment of about 17000 soldiers to europe 
once they arrived ground and aerial maneuvers were conducted in 
west germany with a total 97700 american and allied troops 
on wednesday the pentagon announced that reforger 89 set for 
september had been canceled and would be merged with reforger 90 
which has now been scheduled for january to march 1990 
in place of reforger 89 the allies now intend to stage a smaller 
exercise dubbed caravan guard to test the improved training 
techniques planned for reforger 90 the pentagon said 
the defense department refused to say how many soldiers would 
cross the atlantic ocean for reforger 90 it did say however the 
field manuever portion of the exercise would involve about 75000 
allied troops total or more than 20000 fewer than last year 
in a move designed to enable the us army europe to train 
smarter and ultimately improve combat readiness the us european 
command has announced a major enhancement to the reforger exercise 
program the pentagon said in its statement 
the reforger enhancement program will allow us forces to 
obtain the maximum training value from major exercises by 
integrating new computer simulation technology command post 
exercises and field training exercises 
cmdr mel sundin a pentagon spokesman said the pentagon was 
convinced that computer technology can be used to realistically 
simulate a wide range of operational and logistical functions 
normally carried out by soldiers in the field 
when properly integrated these simulations will force 
commanders and their staffs to make realtime decisions just as if 
they were issuing orders to deployed units he said

opponents of the partial merger of the detroit 
news and the detroit free press asked a federal appeals court 
wednesday to delay the business deal until a legal battle over the 
agreement is resolved 
the motion filed by michigan citizens for an independent press 
a coalition of newspaper advertisers and readers sought to halt the 
newspapers plan to proceed with the merger on feb 6 the group is 
asking the full 13member us court of appeals for the district of 
columbia circuit to hear arguments for rejecting the proposed merger 
the motion said implementing the agreement would result in the 
elimination of approximately 500 jobs the publication of a single 
paper on weekends increased circulation prices and probably higher 
advertising prices as well 
the newspapers would suffer comparatively little harm should 
the agreement be delayed the motion said 
knightridder inc owner of the news disputed the contention 
that the newspapers would suffer little harm from further delay a 
spokesman for the newspaper group frank hawkins said in miami that 
the delay is costing something in the range of 50000 a day 
that turns into a lot of money in a hurry hawkins said 
the news publisher louis weil said in detroit financially 
neither paper is making money right now for that exact reason we 
want to move forward because all of this has gone on long enough 
but even more importantly in terms of the employees its time 
to bring this to a conclusion thats why were moving forward 
weil said 
gannett co inc owner of the free press declined comment from 
its arlington va headquarters 
free press publisher david lawrence said in fact the great 
harm continues not only the harm in terms of thousands of dollars 
that are lost each day but the harm in the uncertainty which has 
clouded this newspapers future for almost three years now 
people here are entitled to know that their jobs are safe that 
their newspaper can go ahead readers of the newspaper are entitled 
to know their paper has a future 
under the proposed 100year agreement the news and free press 
would combine business and production operations while maintaining 
separate news and editorial departments 
gannett initially would take 55 percent of the joint operations 
profits or losses after six years the split would be 5050 between 
gannett and knightridder knightridder has said it will close the 
free press without a joint operating agreement 
an threejudge appeals court panel splitting 2to1 on friday 
rejected opponents arguments that thenattorney general edwin meese 
iii had gone beyond the intent of the law in approving the joint 
operating agreement an exemption from federal antitrust laws 
allowed when one of the newspapers is in danger of financial failure

about 2500 army and air force 
personnel are invading national forests and military bases as part 
of a joint exercise designed to improve coordination between 
branches of the armed services 
the sixweek training exercise dubbed jaguar bite began jan 9 
at seven sites in six states to give troops a taste of different 
terrains and climates it ends feb 17 
the exercise helps improve interservice coordination right down 
to combat uniforms worn by commanders at this army post where the 
exercise is headquartered said air force brig gen hanson scott 
if you were to walk in right now you would be hard pressed to 
tell who is an army guy and who is an air force guy said scott 
who is deputy director of the exercise 
jaguar bite is the largest nationwide exercise conducted by the 
defense departments join special forces command since it was 
created nearly two years ago 
the reason for establishment of the us special operations 
command based at macdill air force base in tampa was to improve 
coordination among special forces in the various services such as 
the armys green berets and navys seals 
if you go back some years ago perhaps all the services were 
guilty of not having enough joint training scott said 
poor coordination of special operations became the targe of 
congressional criticism after a hostagerescue mission to iran in 
1980 ended in disaster a navy helicopter and an air force cargo 
plane collided at a desert staging area killing eight servicemen 
one important aspect of training sidebyside is that members of 
the different service branches learn to understand each others 
jargon and acronyms that are so popular in the military scott said 
unlike conventional military exercises jaguar bite is primarily 
conducted at night and with small units to simulate the unique 
missions of special operations including fast deployment over long 
distances and infiltrating enemy lines 
scott said the exercise has been going well except for some 
severe winter weather in northern states a deployment to michigans 
upper peninsula was delayed and troops were withdrawn from the field 
in montana 
we didnt see for a peacetime exercise leaving the people out 
there he said although they were equipped to survive the harsh 
weather 
the training sites are fort chaffee ark fort bragg nc 
helena national forest mont ocala national forest fla francis 
marion national forest sc hiawatha national forest mich and 
cherry point marine corps station nc where a battalion of 
marines is playing the role of an aggressor force

a newspaper wednesday criticized chinas stupid 
habit of banquets saying they waste money and dont compare to 
parties in the west 
the newspaper economic information said chinese officials eat 
drink and waste too much during their ubiquitous feasts 
impoverishing the countrys coffers and threatening the health of 
the revelers 
the staterun press is engaged in a campaign to illuminate social 
problems resulting from chinas economic reforms designed to open 
china to the west 
a recent article on liquor in the china youth news called the 
chinese spirit maotai an allpurpose grease for bribing 
officials another report in the peasants daily told a short story 
about a young woman who became a prostitute because she loved money 
sunday marks the start of the spring festival the lunar new year 
and chinas biggest holiday families enterprises and ministries 
regularly hold banquets during the holidays consuming large amounts 
of food and drink 
in the weeks before and after the spring festival who knows 
how much food will be waisted and how many people will get sick 
because of overindulgence the article said 
the main reason for overindulgence the article said was that 
chinese people are not educated enough 
as soon as a stupid person gets a little money the first 
thing he thinks about is a banquet eating and drinking said the 
article titled get rid of the stupid habit of banquets over 
time this foolishness has become a custom that wont be changed 
easily 
the poorer you are the bigger the banquet the story said 
pointing to weddings 
a couple with an elementary school education will fill 20 
tables for their wedding banquet those with a high school education 
will reserve five a couple who has graduated from college will 
handle two tables and those with a doctorate wont even fill one 
it said 
another problem is that too many dishes are served 
we treat our guests as if theyre starving to death the 
article said first theyre eight cold dishes then eight hot 
dishes then a whole chicken then a whole duck then a giant carp 
then a hot pot then dessert and fruit 
by the time the feast is over about twothirds of the food 
remains 
alcohol was cited as another problem 
revelers wont rest until they make the guests drunk it 
said the result is that both guest and host get plastered the 
lighter ones talk nonsense the heavier ones end up getting sick on 
the floor going home and suffering the curses of their wives or 
parents 
the story called on chinese revelers to study parties in the west 
parties in the west are worth copying in china it said a 
host puts some dishes on a table and lets the guest pick and choose 
as they please such a method is very convenient

a handful of senators complaining about how 
much time is spent on raising campaign money said wednesday they 
want a constitutional amendment to let congress set limits on the 
costs of running for office 
public office all too often goes to the highest bidder the 
highest spender said sen alan cranston dcalif whose 1986 
reelection campaign was among the most expensive in us history 
the constitutional amendment was introduced by sen ernest f 
hollings dsc and backed by cranston and six other senators it 
would allow congress and state governments to set reasonable 
limits on campaign expenditures 
hollings who backed a similar amendment in the last congress 
said the amendment was needed because of a supreme court decision 
striking down attempts to limit campaign spending saying it would 
infringe on rights of free speech 
if youre rich you have freedom of speech hollings said 
if youre poor you have the freedom to shut up 
if the amendment were passed by congress and ratified by the 
state legislatures hollings said the laws actually imposing the 
limits would then be drafted 
he said congress would need to go to work to eliminate practices 
of raising soft money funds gathered by political parties for 
presidential campaigns and bundling a mechanism that allows 
the parties to bypass spending limits on congressional campaigns 
coincidentally the federal election commission on wednesday 
announced that the national republican senatorial committee agreed 
to pay a 20000 fine for its handling of a 1986 fundraising 
campaign for a dozen senate candidates to which thenvice president 
bush lent his support 
the commission found that the committee set up by the republican 
party to assist in electing gop senatorial candidates violated 
federal election law because it did not charge the candidates for 
the cost of the fundraising effort 
however the sixmember commission deadlocked over a related 
question of whether the senatorial committee broke the law by the 
way it funneled more than 27 million in campaign contributions to 
the 12 candidates 
republican senate candidates in alabama arkansas california 
colorado florida georgia louisiana missouri nevada north 
carolina south dakota and vermont were on the receiving end of the 
funnel 
the commissions decision which was reached last year but was 
not released until wednesday dealt with bundling a tactic used by 
political committees to gather funds from individual contributors 
and then channel the money to a particular candidate specified by 
the donor 
the practice allows organizations to bypass provisions in the law 
setting limits on how much money they can give a candidate under 
the law the national republican senatorial committee and the 
republican national committee can give no more than a total of 
17500 to a senate candidate 
the elections laws permit political organizations to act as a 
conduit for contributions to candidates as long as the organization 
does not exert enough control over the money to channel the cash to 
whomever it chooses 
one fundraising letter sent out by the committee and signed by 
bush asked for contributions for the senate candidates in south 
dakota nevada louisiana and california 
bushs letter warned that if the four republicans in those states 
dont raise at least 236500 in the next 21 days theyll lose 
its that simple and that frightening bush wrote in the 
sept 2 1986 letter thats why im counting on you to rush me 
your check for 25 by return mail today 
all four of those candidates ended up losing 
lawrence m noble the general counsel for the fec argued that 
the republican committees fundraising program was carefully 
designed to channel receipts in ways determined by the committee 
itself 
stuart gerson an attorney for the gop in the case said the 
donor not the committee is in control of the funds 
after all they write the checks the party committee does 
not gerson said once the donor gives the committee has no 
choice but to forward that to the candidate within the appropriate 
period of time 
while the commission failed to support nobles argument on that 
point it did find that the republican committee should have 
declared that the 608568 cost of its fundraising effort should 
have been counted itself as a contribution to the senate candidates 
campaigns

a contractor doing preliminary repair work 
on a highway bridge discovered an 18inch hole in the deck 
wednesday forcing state transportation officials to close two of 
three lanes while emergency repairs were made 
you can see all the way through the deck said william keish 
a state department of transportation spokesman 
the interstate 95 bridge over the rippowam river in stamford and 
is three miles from the mianus river bridge in greenwich which 
collapsed in june 1983 killing three people 
keish said the rippowam river bridge was sound and the 18inch 
hole posed no danger to motorists 
the bridge lanes closed around 9 am and was to reopen with an 
emergency patch in place by the afternoon rush hour keish said the 
discovery did not affect morning rush hour but by 1 pm traffic 
was backed up three to four miles state police said 
the repairs involved ripping up a 4by6 foot patch of pavement 
and replacing it with a quickdrying patch keish said the entire 
bridge deck is to be replaced as part of work to be completed by 
june 1991 he said 
collapse of the mianus river bridge in 1983 prompted the state to 
begin a multibilliondollar 10year road and bridge repair program 
a superior court jury decided three years ago that inadequate 
maintenance led to the bridge collapse 
keish said there was no comparison between the two bridge 
problems 
you had a 100foot section fall out of a bridge completely 
disappear he said of the mianus river bridge here youve got 
an 18inch hole our major concern was the traffic not the hole

the navy said wednesday the 
sinking of one of its supply ships in the antarctic did not result 
in a major oil spill or an ecological disaster in the pristine 
environment 
some environmentalists said the accident left a 10mile oil slick 
and that wildlife was already dying others said it was too early to 
say how much oil spilled and how much damage was done to the region 
and its animals 
there could be a small stain from the release of oil in the 
engine room of the bahia paraiso a navy spokesman said anything 
else no 
the vessel which carried tourists as well as fuel for several 
polar stations hit a rock saturday was evacuated and listed for 
three days before sinking in high winds and heavy seas late tuesday 
night no one was injured 
the incident occurred in the bismarck strait 600 miles south of 
cape horn on the tip of south america and within two miles of the 
us palmer research station where the ships 300 tourists and crew 
initially were taken 
the us national science foundation said the vessel carried 
250000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an incurable disaster 
would result if all the fuel leaked into the unspoiled waters in the 
region 
a spokesman at the research station who requested anonymity said 
in a telephone interview that leaking oil had caused a 10mile slick 
officials at the foundation the us base and greenpeace said 
leaking fuel already has killed some krill a shrimplike crustacean 
that is the main food of the baleen whale and a vital part of the 
antarctic food chain 
the ship rolled over is lying on its side almost fully below 
the water peter wilkniss director of the foundations antarctic 
program told abcs good morning america on wednesday 
this is a very enclosed area its a bay bounded by a 
glacier and some islands and our research station so if the oil 
goes into the area then it will have an effect on the shoreline on 
the ice on the animals the organisms on the sediments he told 
abc 
the depth of the water was not known 
neverthess it remained unclear wednesday how much oil had 
spilled and the extent of any ecological damage 
the situation is totally controlled and there is no danger of 
any type of release of fuel said the navy spokesman who demanded 
anonymity 
on tuesday the government news agency telam said the fuel the 
ship carried was contained in individual steel drums the news 
agency quoted a navy source as saying a spill is practically 
impossible 
andrea figari the antarctic expert in buenos aires for the 
environmental organization greenpeace said wednesday we need 
time to confirm whether any oil spilled news reports said krill 
were killed im not sure of that it looks like the ship sank in 
the bay and krill live in the open sea there wouldnt have been a 
lot of krill there 
asked to comment a spokesman at the us embassy in buenos aires 
said were concerned about the potential of an oil spill but to 
the best of our knowlege so far there isnt one reports the bahia 
paraiso carried 250000 gallons of diesel fuel appear to be a 
drastic exaggeration he said 
the bahia paraiso launched in 1980 is a navy vessel that for 
three years has chartered excurision voyages as a way to defray 
expenses

a decision to hold a key central 
committee meeting 10 days earlier than planned fueled speculation 
wednesday about a split in the ruling communist elite over political 
reforms and unpopular price increases 
in a terse announcement after its regular weekly session tuesday 
the partys politburo announced the 108member central committee 
will meet feb 10 to decide topical political questions 
news that the meeting would take place earlier than the scheduled 
feb 20 date followed a statement from party leader karoly grosz 
that differences among the 11 politburo members are slowing reform 
grosz said the central committee must decide whether or not it 
wants to make leadership changes 
he and premier miklos nemeth also made clear in separate 
statements that they disagree with fellow politburo member imre 
pozsgay over the leading reformers startling weekend statement that 
the 1956 antisoviet revolt was a popular uprising 
only the central committee can deliver the final verdict on this 
matter grosz said adding that he has seen no new documents backing 
pozsgays view against the official version that the revolt quashed 
by soviet troops invited by hungarian leaders was a 
counterrevolution 
grosz also said leadership differences are impeding unpopular 
austerity measures and are unsettling western bankers concerned 
about hungarys timely repayment on its 17 billion foreign debt 
two waves of price increases on most consumer staples in january 
have prompted strikes and unprecedented protests from the official 
trade union organization which has called for talks with the 
government 
official statistics in january showed one in five of hungarys 
106 million citizens already is living below the poverty line 
inflation estimated at 1215 percent by the government and 
2025 percent by economists will cut further into hungarians 
living standards this year 
hungarian observers and west and east bloc diplomats noted 
wednesday that while recent political reforms have drawn praise 
abroad they have failed to lift the mood at home hungary recently 
legalized independent movements and demonstrations 
some western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they saw groszs statement as no more than an attempt to unify the 
leadership behind reforms 
others however noted the statement implied criticism of both 
pozsgay and chief party ideologist janos berecz who last weekend 
suggested the party was not quite capable of directing the 
processes in hungarian politics 
hungarys increasingly candid state media had no independent 
comment wednesday 
but they did print long summaries of western press comment 
highlighting foreign speculation that recent events may presage 
leadership changes

the internal revenue service has again 
deluged librarians looking for a few income tax forms with crates of 
thousands of forms they dont need dont want and cant use 
the bible says ask and you shall receive but this is 
ridiculous and from the irs of all things library director lisa 
jarisch said wednesday as another carton of tax forms arrived the 
library already had cartons containing about 10000 supplemental 
schedules 
jarisch said she found about 100 of the 1040 forms she had sought 
in the box she originally requested about 1000 each of the most 
commonly used forms plus instruction booklets figuring that would 
be sufficient for this berkshire hills city of 16000 people 
it was just a quirk said robert ruttenberg a spokesman for 
the regional irs office in boston suggesting the problem was the 
person taking the telephone order misheard the request 
last year the boxes kept coming until the library had 48625 
forms instead of the assortment of 5000 she had ordered and in 
1987 about 24000 forms were received in response to a similar 
request she said 
the childrens librarian is already planning origami oriental 
paper folding classes and the conservation commission may name me 
the woman of the year for my regular contributions to the 
recycling program jarisch said the irs will take back the forms 
only if the library pays for the shipping she said and im not 
going to do that

happened said anna bartkowski telephone sales manager for the 
department 
the newspaper alerted the funeral home that had placed the death 
notice in the papers and the investigation began 
konopacki said he eventually learned that the case of mistaken 
identity started when a man collapsed on a south side street and was 
taken unconscious to sinai samaritan medical center 
a medicare card and an insurance company letter addressed to 
konopacki were found on the man konopacki said adding that no

president mikhail s gorbachev earns 28800 a 
year about seven times the pay of a typical soviet worker the 
editor of a muckraking moscow weekly said wednesday 
vitaly korotich editor of the magazine ogonyok told the 
associated press that with his salary the soviet leader can afford 
to keep his wife dressed in stylish clothes 
despite glasnost gorbachevs policy of greater openness that has 
permitted magazines such as ogonyok to flourish the salaries 
perquisites and personal lives of soviet leaders are not discussed 
in its media 
korotich said in a telephone interview he had mentioned the 
salary figure and raisa gorbachevs wardrobe in an informal talk to 
student activists in komsomol the young communist league and his 
remarks were published in a youth newspaper in the republic of 
moldavia 
korotich who is generally viewed as a supporter and beneficiary 
of gorbachev said he was neither criticizing nor defending 
gorbachev in his talk 
he said one of the students asked what he thought about mrs 
gorbachev wearing fancy clothes and he replied that on the 
presidents salary of more than 1500 rubles a month gorbachev can 
afford to buy her new dresses sometimes that equals 2400 a month 
at the official rate of exchange 
mrs gorbachevs clothes quite fashionable by soviet standards 
and often mentioned during her trips abroad are the subject of 
considerable grumbling among soviet women who arent accustomed to 
their leaders wives appearing in public and who suffer from a 
chronic lack of food and consumer goods 
although gorbachevs reported salary far exceeds the average wage 
of about 350 a month it couldnt begin to pay for the many 
privileges afforded the top soviet leadership 
members of the elite have limousines special food packages 
access to special stores summer homes special schools and camps 
for their children and other perquisites that set them apart from 
typical citizens 
while ordinary soviets wait in long lines for items such as 
coffee detergent fruit vegetables and chocolate the elite can 
have such things delivered or pick them up at stores that are 
offlimits to average citizens 
kremlin leaders and their families also are assigned apartments 
that are deluxe and spacious by soviet standards 
such privileges occasionally have been challenged most recently 
at the national communist party conference in july by boris n 
yeltsin the ousted moscow party boss who was entitled to them as a 
member of the ruling politburo in an address to the conference 
yeltsin who still retains some popular support despite losing his 
influential posts called for abolition of special privileges for 
the elite 
if there are some shortages in our socialist society then 
everybody should share the same shortage he said we must do 
away with elitism eliminate the word spets special from our 
vocabulary 
gorbachev later said in a televised discussion with conference 
delegates that we should take a look at party privileges because 
there are so many popular complaints about them

the soviet union is postponing hard economic 
choices at home while seeking to finance reforms through loans from 
the west says the author of a new book on the soviet economy 
author judy shelton joins a chorus of skeptics including many on 
capitol hill who are urging the new bush administration to forge a 
coherent policy in the west to review the strategic implications of 
lending to the soviet bloc 
sheltons new book the coming soviet crash gorbachevs 
desperate pursuit of credit in western financial markets 
concludes that soviet accountants have been fudging the countrys 
economic figures for years steadily reporting budget surpluses when 
there were actually growing deficits 
the soviets finally admitted to a budget deficit last october 
although one respected soviet economist has said the deficit is 
three times higher than the kremlin acknowledged 
the issue has aroused concern among members of congress 
including sen bill bradley dnj who has cautioned that giving 
the kremlin easy credits could undercut us interests and harm 
rather than help the reforms of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the west has been slow to respond wrote shelton gorbachevs 
onslaught of financial maneuvers seems to have left the united 
states dazed 
under gorbachev the kremlin has turned increasingly to the west 
for financing increasing commercial borrowing by half and securing 
lines of guaranteed credit from western governments worth 7 
billion she said 
as part of the reforms the soviets are publishing many 
previously secret economic statistics although shelton and others 
question the data 
last august in a prospectus for its first foreign bond issue 
the soviet government said it had a budget surplus putting the 
figure at 3 billion rubles or 18 billion 
it was revealed three months later that the soviets had been 
running a deficit for years shelton said the revelation she 
said did not prompt a protest from the swiss bank that sponsored 
the loan or from those who bought the issue 
shelton said the continued cloudiness of soviet financial figures 
does not augur well for the west as the soviets seek to join such 
western financial institutions as the international monetary fund 
world bank and the general agreement on trade and tariffs which 
require reporting in which no numbers are hidden 
although the soviet union has increased its international 
borrowing the credits do not come close to covering the deficit 
and the kremlin has simply printed more money to cover the gap she 
wrote 
gorbachev has backed away from one of the toughest political 
decisions facing him and has maintained subsidies and controls for 
prices of key commoditities shelton said in a capitol hill 
presentation this week 
for the west the greatest concern is that the soviets are 
borrowing money abroad while postponing tough political decisions at 
home 
the correlation between gorbachevs reign in the kremlin and 
the escalation of soviet borrowing activities in western financial 
markets is striking wrote shelton a researcher at the hoover 
institution of stanford university 
within two years after gorbachev took power in march 1985 
soviet debt to the west shot up from about 25 billion to over 37 
billion an increase of 50 percent she wrote 
bradley in a new york times column on jan 6 cautioned that 
the notion that western governments can help mr gorbachev through 
cheap credit is flawed 
reform means making tough choices butter not weapons 
efficiency not useless output consumption not forced saving the 
real reformers know this they also know it means higher prices 
less job security and harder work today in exchange for the promise 
of a better life tomorrow bradley said 
continuing shortages of basic goods and revelations about the 
soviet budget deficit have tempered optimism about that better life 
soviet finance minister boris i gostev last october estimated 
the budget deficit at 35 billion rubles about 58 billion at 
current exchange rates 
another wellknown soviet economist leonid abalkin last week 
said that the actual deficit was nearly three times gostevs 
estimate about 165 billion or 11 percent of the gross national 
product by comparison the us government deficit runs at about 4 
percent of gnp 
other soviet officials have been more optimistic mikhail 
korolev chairman of the state committee for statistics wrote in 
pravda on monday that the gnp grew 5 percent last year and was 133 
percent higher than in 1985 
the government announced this month that soviet gnp in 1988 
totaled 866 billion rubles or 14 trillion that was less than 
half of the 1985 us gnp of 38 trillion

a bitter wind whipped the flags at half staff 
wednesday as people at ki sawyer air force base mourned the deaths 
of 17 colleagues 
thats eerie to see that flag said an airman at the 
northern michigan installation its even worse to see the 
families of the victims coming in 
a military refueling plane that left sawyer on monday crashed and 
exploded tuesday as it tried to take off from dyess air force base 
near abilene texas all 19 aboard died 
it was the third fiery crash since october involving planes 
originating from sawyer one of the air forces northern tier posts 
by lake superior 
were dealing with a base that has gone through three tragedies 
in four months said capt paul bicking a sawyer spokesman 
ive heard different comments such as trouble comes in threes and 
now that weve had our three weve had our trouble for awhile 
the 26yearold kc135 tanker that crashed in texas on tuesday 
carried 17 people from the sawyer area along with two passengers 
who boarded at dyess 
the plane was to escort and refuel four f16 jets from carswell 
air force base in fort worth texas and land at hawaii before 
reaching its principal destination andersen air force base in guam 
bicking said 
seven of the dead were members of the planes flight and 
maintenance crews from sawyer air force officials said the rest 
included four civilian relatives of military personnel and four 
military retirees who were taking advantage of the militarys policy 
of allowing them to hop overseas flights when there is space on 
board 
its another plane crash said marquette resident george 
smith sipping coffee at a local diner it seems like they happen 
every day now 
sawyer continued routine operations wednesday but the closeknit 
base closed ranks and effectively shut out outsiders 
our family is going through the process of mourning were 
caring for our people said the base wing commander col eldon 
joersz in a very terse meeting with the press he walked out 
without answering questions 
theyre pretty devastated we want to regroup said another 
base spokesman sgt joseph butera 
memorial services at the base chapel were planned for friday 
the tension contrasted with the fortunate feeling at sawyer 
following the dec 6 explosion of a b52 bomber as it went through a 
touchandgo landing on the bases main runway all eight crew 
members survived in what base personnel called a miracle 
three months earlier 10 sawyer personnel had survived the oct 
11 crash of a kc135 that killed six people from a sister michigan 
base

a congresional task force on wednesday proposed 
a radical revamping of the us foreign aid program saying the 
current system has become too diluted haphazard and bureaucratized 
to meet its goals 
since the united states entered the foreign aid arena with the 
marshall plan for europe after world war ii the program has grown 
more complex global realities have changed and america has lost its 
position as the worlds most charitable nation said the report to 
the house foreign affairs committee 
us foreign assistance needs a new premise a new framework 
and a new purpose to meet the challenges of today said the 
report presented to committee members in a closeddoor meeting 
it is time to start anew 
the task force led by reps lee hamilton dind and benjamin 
gilman rny recommended repeal of the basic foreign aid law 
passed 28 years ago which it said has grown cumbersome and 
inconsistent 
it called instead for a new international economic cooperation 
act of 1989 which would more narrowly define the goals of us aid 
to other countries and aim american help at encouraging broadbased 
economic growth in third world countries and alleviating poverty 
while encouraging political freedom and environmental protection 
the recommendations would sharply curb the use of earmarks 
the instructions by congress spelling out precisely which countries 
and programs are to receive money and how much the practice has 
grown to the point where nearly all military and economic aid money 
is earmarked and half of development funds leaving little 
flexibility to those who administer the programs 
kathleen mazzocco a spokeswoman for the nonprofit population 
crisis committee said her groups population control activities 
were typical of the kinds of programs that are politically 
vulnerable and could suffer if protective earmarks are eliminated 
there will be constant warfare and conflict no collegiality 
among the competing groups she said in addition to family 
planning efforts agriculture and health programs are also likely to 
be vulnerable to cuts she said 
hamilton had hinted at some of the new directions in an article 
in the february issue of the foreign service journal in which he 
said our current program suffers from too great a concentration on 
the middle east too much emphasis on military sales and too 
great an emphasis on immediate political objectives 
in the current fiscal year israel and egypt will recieve half of 
the total 15 billion us aid budget with another large slice 
going to other strategically important allies such as pakistan 
turkey the philippines el salvador and greece relatively little 
is left for africa and others among the worlds poorest countries 
in inflationadjusted dollars this years aid total is the same 
as americans spent in 1977 and represents an alltime low for the 
united states as a percentage of its gross national product for the 
first time this year japan is surpassing the united states as the 
worlds largest donor country 
the reports authors hope it will be the framework for 
construction of this years foreign aid legislation but they 
acknowledge their approach will be a hard sell foreign aid is among 
the leastpopular government programs and budget constraints mean 
it will be under an even greater than usual squeeze this time 
as the pie shrinks members of congress interest groups 
departments and agencies will each fight to protect their particular 
interest the report stated in sum the united states will have 
to do more with available resources 
under the new system aid programs would be evaluated by how well 
they achieve their goals rather than focusing on heavy accounting 
and reporting requirements that have turned aid programs into a 
bureaucratic nightmare the task force said 
the act would establish a new economic cooperation agency to 
administer its programs as the successor to the agency for 
international development which now handles that task

a bipartisan draft document given out to senators and obtained 
by the associated press compares the latest house and senate 
proposals on outside income 
both packages would ban honoraria including fees for speeches 
appearances and articles upon enactment of the raise that would 
boost congressional salaries from 89500 to 135000 
leaders in both houses have made clear that honoraria would 
continue if the pay raise is defeated because members dont want to 
suffer a loss of income rankandfile house members currently can 
retain 26850 and senate members 35800 in honoraria 
the senate plan includes a contingency that would permit 
retention of some honoraria if the raise is eventually scaled back 
the pay plan now before congress can only be defeated if both houses 
reject it the senate is virtually certain to turn the raise down 
but the question of whether the house will vote on it depends on a 
survey of members intentions ordered by speaker jim wright dtexas 
under the honoraria proposals both houses would permit such fees 
to be donated to charity on a members behalf the senate plan would 
limit the donation to 2000 per appearance and require members to 
list on financial disclosure forms the amount the payer and the 
recipient of the donation 
the house and senate plans would allow groups that invite members 
to an event to continue paying for travel the senate would direct 
its ethics committee to issue rules and regulations defining 
acceptable limits 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif has told reporters 
there would likely be a time restriction on house members travel 
with exceptions made for multiday events 
the house draft would prohibit members from receiving any pension 
benefits from honoraria given as a charitable donation the senate 
plan would go further prohibiting conversion of any of the 
donations to a members personal use 
the house plan would limit all outside earned income to 15 
percent of a members salary half the current 30 percent 
the house also would end a provision in federal law that has 
allowed 190 house members in office before 1980 to accumulate 39 
million in campaign funds that could be converted to personal use 
the measure would become effective in january 1991 giving house 
members one chance to retire with the money 
the senate already has a rule prohibiting such conversion 
the house proposal would incorporate restrictions on members that 
already exist under senate rules 
the restrictions include a ban on affiliating with business 
entities for compensation a prohibition on practicing a profession 
except parttime teaching and a ban on serving as an officer or 
board member on a publicly held or regulated corporation 
wright and senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine 
have promised that honoraria packages will be taken up immediately 
if the pay raise becomes law next wednesday

authorities are probing allegations that 
kurdish guerrillas were buried in a mass grave near the garbage dump 
of a southeastern city the local prosecutor said wednesday 
mustafa erdogdu said in a telephone interview that a preliminary 
investigation is checking allegations published in the sunday 
edition of the leftist weekly 2000ne dogru toward 2000 he did not 
elaborate 
the weekly reported that kurdish guerrillas killed in shootouts 
with security forces as well as suspects who died in custody were 
buried in a mass grave near the city of siirt 
the siirt garbage dump is full of bodies the magazine quoted 
zubeyir aydar a lawyer and the former local chief of the main 
opposition social democrat populist party as saying 
kurds comprise an estimated onefifth of turkeys 55 million 
people kurdish guerrillas members of the marxist kurdish labor 
party have been fighting government forces in southeast turkey 
since 1984 to set up an independent state leaving hundreds of 
people dead 
the magazine quoted bedria akan whose son hasan akar died in 
detention in april 1985 as saying his body was never given to the 
family and she heard rumors it was dumped in the alleged mass grave 
the report said relatives of missing people in the city had been 
demanding that officials dig open the riverbed it did not say how 
many people were missing 
the weekly said hayrettin kozakcioglu the regional governor for 
the southeast provinces acknowledged that three kurdish guerrillas 
killed in a shootout last february were buried near the site when 
nobody claimed the bodies 
i have no other knowledge it quoted the governor as saying 
the governor could not be reached by phone to comment on the 
report officials in ankara turkeys capital also had no comment 
last month authorities arrested 400 people suspected of aiding 
the guerrillas opposition parties charged that some of the suspects 
were mistreated and a few were forced to eat human excrement local 
authorities denied the charges 
kurds also populate portions of iran iraq syria and the soviet 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan kurdish rebels have also fought 
for autonomy in northeastern iraq

a marathon debate of the communist 
partys deeply divided central committee ended wednesday with no 
compromise and a stern call for the party to adopt reforms 
we are divided on fundamental questions committee member 
josip vrhovec said late tuesday the split was so bad he said we 
already have two different clearly ideologically defined parties 
the first and most important part of wednesdays meeting ended 
with a speech by national party chief stipe suvar who quashed 
attempts to oust him by serbian and other conservatives 
but the session continued with a laborious discussion of 
personnel issues focusing on azem vlasi a former party chief in 
restive kosovo province 
the only agreement reached was that the party hold an emergency 
congress before the end of this year to try again to overcome the 
rift in the leadership over economic and political targets 
the threeday meeting was marked by verbal clashes between 
liberals advocating greater political pluralism and more democracy 
and conservatives seeking greater central party control to overcome 
yugoslavias worst crisis 
suvar said the choice facing the country is one of an open market 
or a statecontrolled one between a state based on the rule of 
law or the revolutionary one and between political pluralism or 
domination of a single doctrine 
he urged members to create a political climate for the party to 
implement the reforms necessary to overcome the difficult 
situation in the country and to enable the communist party to stop 
losing battle after battle 
suvar referred to a statement by adm petar simic political 
chief of the armed forces who warned monday the party is losing 
battle after battle 
what some describe as the battle for yugoslavia will not be 
waged without the yugoslav army simic said 
the session also was marked by a sharp clash and heated exchanges 
over suvars sentiments toward serbia between the national party 
chiefs political allies mainly from the liberal northern republics 
of slovenia and croatia and supporters of hardline serbian party 
chief slobodan milosevic 
suvar described as pure fabrication accusations that he is 
biased against serbian interests 
apparently referring to serbian hardliners he said we have 
to overcome the quarrelsome and intolerant thinking that only one 
truth exists and that all other opinions must be defeated 
suvar also has drawn strong support from the central republic of 
bosnia and southern macedonia region as well as from some delegates 
of kosovo where albanians are a majority 
we dont have time for compromises said ali sabani an 
ethnic albanian a battle is being waged to liquidate this central 
committee the presidium politburo and its president according to 
a wellknown scenario 
the same scenario would then be used on the federal state 
presidency sabani said in clear reference to milosevic and his 
alleged ambitions in national politics 
conversely a serbian speaker asked can this leadership take 
us out of the crisis 
the final decision was left to the 23member ruling politburo 
but it is highly unlikely it will relieve suvar before his term 
expires in june 
the next scheduled party congress is to take place in 1990 the 
extraordinary congress is to take place at an unspecified date later 
this year

a year after being taken hostage by two 
shotgunwielding indians the staff of the robesonian made jokes and 
fielded crank calls as they worked to get the newspaper out their 
editor said wednesday 
we thought there might be some crank calls and there were 
bob horne said people called up and said happy feb 1 or 
happy anniversary nothing too serious 
a year ago wednesday tuscarora indians eddie hatcher and timothy 
jacobs held up to 20 staff members hostage for 10 hours while airing 
charges that local officials were involved in drug trafficking the 
siege ended when gov jim martin agreed to form a task force to 
investigate the charges 
both indians were found innocent of federal hostagetaking and 
firearms violations in october but now each faces 14 state charges 
of kidnapping hatcher is seeking refuge with the shoshonebannock 
indians in idaho while jacobs is awaiting an extradition hearing 
later this month in new york 
horne said the scene in the newsroom was much different from last 
year when some terrorized staffers feared for their lives after 
being posted as human shields in doorways 
theres been some joking today about the incident which i 
thought was positive that people could joke about it he said 
horne said the newspaper noted the anniversary with a long story 
interviewing leaders from the countys black indian and white 
communities about changes that have taken place in the last year 
the takeover and the fatal shooting of indian judicial candidate 
julian pierce a month later resulted in the establishment of a 
human relations council for the county a public defenders office 
and a second superior court judgeship that martin filled with an 
indian lawyer 
jacobs and hatcher on tuesday sued martin state attorney general 
lacy thornburg and 18 other state and county officials the lawsuit 
asks a federal judge to block their extradition and prosecution on 
the kidnapping charges because their civil rights have been violated 
thornburg said tuesday the state will press for the extradition 
and prosecution of the men despite the lawsuit 
the us attorneys office in raleigh has issued a federal 
warrant for hatcher charging him with unlawful flight from 
prosecution gloria dupree a spokeswoman for the office said 
wednesday that the warrant issued monday would allow federal agents 
to arrest hatcher and return him to north carolina to face the 
kidnapping charges 
an fbi spokesman in charlotte said whether fbi agents could go on 
the fort hall reservation in idaho to arrest hatcher would depend on 
local arrangements with the reservation 
some reservations have asked the federal government to act as a 
policing authority on the reservation the spokesman said some 
reservations have said no we want to do it ourselves

the government will let the united states test an 
unarmed version of a highly advanced cruise missile over western 
canada the defense minister said wednesday 
the missile will fly from the beaufort sea in the arctic across 
northeastern british columbia and over northern alberta to a 
military weapons range on the albertasaskatchewan border 
the missile known as the agm129a is more advanced than other 
us airlaunched cruise missiles tested over canada since 1983 
the lowflying cigarshaped weapon which uses the stealth 
technology being applied to other us defense systems is better 
able to avoid radar detection officials say 
defense minister bill mcknight said the missile test is expected 
to be conducted before march 31 
the cruise missile tests have been controversial in canada since 
they began opponents of the test argue that the missile could be 
used as a firststrike weapon supporters say it is a deterrent 
the defense minister said the warsaw pact already has a 
significant and improving cruise missile capability 
we support the pursuit of mutual arms reduction a process that 
can only move ahead effectively if both sides are dealing from 
equivalent positions mcknight said 
the missile is capable of carrying conventional or nuclear 
warheads

pollutants that scientists say are creating the greenhouse 
effect or global warming trend was unveiled wednesday by sen

tens of thousands of aids patients could be 
helped by an experimental drug soon to be approved in aerosol form 
by the food and drug administration aids activists said wednesday 
the drug pentamidine is believed to have some effect in 
preventing pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which causes an estimated 
60 percent of aids deaths 
it is a dramatic breakthrough in terms of offering a preventive 
treatment for the most deadly infections that strike people whose 
immune systems have been depleted by aids said jeffrey levi 
executive director of the gay and lesbian task force 
fda approval of widespread distribution of the aerosol drug is 
imminent fda spokesman donald mclearn said 
the fda would not say how many people it expected would have 
access to the drug but levi estimated tens of thousands of people 
would be eligible 
pentamidine was approved five years ago for use as an injectable 
drug the spray version under fda review would make it easier to 
take into the lungs where pneumocystis first shows up 
the fda decision would be in a special category that allows 
widespread distribution of promising drugs before they are approved 
for commercial distribution normally the government requires years 
of studies before permitting general use of a drug 
until a drug receives full approval its use normally is not 
covered by government or private health insurance policies often 
during experimental use of a drug the manufacturer distributes it 
free to patients 
lyphomed inc of rosemont ill the leading supplier of 
injectable pentamidine and the company expected to be licensed to 
supply the aerosol version said it would release information about 
its plans for the drug next week 
aids activists have complained that the government has moved too 
slowly in permitting the use of promising drugs for people who have 
the aids virus however activists praised the fda action which is 
expected next week 
its quite important as a symbol an example of the fda moving 
faster than it has in the past said thomas hannon associate 
director of the new york community research initiative which 
conducted one of the studies on the aerosol form of pentamidine 
theyve talked a lot about a faster approval process for drugs 
for lifethreatening diseases like cancer and aids and this is 
encouraging he said 
levi said its an indication that the process is working 
better 
but he added people are cautious because they dont know how 
the drug will be available and the conditions fda will place on 
its use 
not all aids activists however praised the fdas work on 
pentamidine 
this should have been fully approved by now said mark 
harrington of a new yorkbased group called aids coalition to 
unleash power 
about 50 members of the group rode a bus to bethesda md on 
wednesday to attend a meeting of a government panel that is studying 
ways to reduce approval time for aids and cancer drugs 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the chief 
victims of aids have been homosexual men and intravenous drug 
abusers 
the federal centers for disease control said that as of jan 30 
84985 aids cases had been reported in america more than half 
48582 have died there have been 2228 new cases reported since 
jan 1 the cdc said

a 71yearold woman who maintains a 
ramshackle homestead at an undeveloped state park has sued the state 
in an effort to prevent her eviction 
in the lawsuit filed tuesday in derby superior court attorney 
john williams said the eviction of doris gagnon would be unnecessary 
and would shorten her life 
i personally feel if they take her out of there and demolish 
that little compound she has put together and put her in a nursing 
home she wont live very long williams said 
williams is seeking an injunction preventing the state from 
trying to evict gagnon who has cancer for five years or for the 
rest of her life whichever is shorter 
williams said he decided on a fiveyear time limit because it 
would take the state at least that long to come up with funds to 
develop the park on land along long island sound 
leslie carothers the states commissioner of environmental 
protection said she had no comment because she hadnt read 
williams suit carothers department is pursuing eviction of gagnon 
gagnons homestead is near the site of her former home which the 
state condemned and demolished in 1971 to make way for the park she 
has lived since in a makeshift compound that includes a trailer and 
coops where she keeps chickens 
state authorities servied notice in november that they wanted her 
off the land after receiving a complaint from milford health 
officials that her presence represented a nuisance to the public 
health 
during a summer inspection of the property health officials said 
they found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living quarters 
the homestead is served by no public utilities 
state officials said they also took action at this time because 
development work is expected to begin this summer and they want to 
avoid delays

on the eve of toplevel usjapanese talks 
five senators on wednesday urged president bush to conduct a 
complete review of a pending deal under which japan would receive 8 
billion in advanced aircraft technology 
in a letter to bush the senators said the deal involving the fsx 
fighter raises serious questions about its longterm impact on the 
health and competitiveness of the american aerospace industry 
sending the letter were sens jeff bingaman dnm alan dixon 
dill wendell ford dky jesse helms rnc and frank 
murkowski ralaska 
they noted that during the visit of japanese prime minister 
noboru takeshita on thursday and friday there likely will be 
intense pressure to give the full commitment of the president 
to the program 
however to do so without a full assessment of the programs 
longterm impact would not be in the best interests of the united 
states the senators told bush 
under the proposed deal japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
would develop and produce a newgeneration japanese fighter using 
technology for the us f16 fighter obtained from general dynamics 
which would serve as a subcontractor to mitsubishi 
this codevelopment effort would be in lieu of directly 
purchasing fighters from the united states or manufacturing them 
under us license 
critics of the deal contend it would delay strengthening of 
japans defense forces due to time needed to design and build the 
fsx and go too far in furthering development of the japanese 
aircraft industry in competition with the united states 
in their letter to bush the senators complained that 
negotiations over the fsx have been carried out by the state 
department and pentagon without involvement of the us trade 
representative and the commerce department 
we are requesting that you order a complete review of the fsx 
program within the administration including the departments of 
commerce labor and energy as well as the office of the trade 
representative and the white house science office the letter said 
it added we hope that your administration will refrain from 
any further commitments on the fsx until that review has been 
completed and the congress has been fully consulted 
during his confirmation hearings last week defense 
secretarydesignate john tower told senators he would review the 
agreement negotiated during the reagan administration 
at the state department officials said a review was currently in 
progress after which the department hoped to proceed on the 
arrangement by giving congress the required 30day formal notice in 
which to object to the technology transfer

nine more potential jurors were picked 
wednesday for oliver norths irancontra trial in a laborious effort 
interrupted by the judges threat to hold a tv reporter in contempt 
for making jury selection even tougher 
so far there are 16 people in the pool of prospects from which 
12 jurors and six alternates eventually will be chosen the judge in 
the case said at days end he hoped the jury could be selected 
monday 
us district judge gerhard a gesell angrily said he was 
considering holding abc news correspondent tim obrien in contempt 
of court he said an abc account tuesday night appears to be a 
deliberate effort to obstruct jury selection by airing 
congressional testimony north had given covering the same subjects 
on which he now faces charges 
the judges comments showed continuing concern about the 
difficulty of picking jurors unfamiliar norths previous testimony 
about the irancontra affair he testified in nationally televised 
congressional hearings in 1987 under a grant of limited immunity 
from prosecution 
north himself has steered clear of public comments going into and 
out of the courthouse however he cracked a few jokes about the 
trial in remarks to a religious group at a breakfast early tuesday 
he said he could stay only a few minutes because i have an 
appearance elsewhere that i have been invited to then he said 
normally in order to speak i have to have a subpoena 
before jury selection resumed after lunch north signed several 
autographs for an admirer in the courtroom then gave him a friendly 
slap on the shoulder 
the 12 felony charges against north include lying to congress and 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii about his role in the 
irancontra affair and illegally using a taxexempt foundation to 
help finance a secret war against nicaraguas sandinista 
government 
it seemed like the whole world was talking about that 
testimony defense lawyer brendan v sullivan jr said in court 
trying to probe a prospective jurors knowledge of norths public 
admissions two years ago that he lied and destroyed national 
security council documents 
gesell excused three prospective jurors who said they had seen 
norths congressional testimony including a department store clerk 
who acknowledged that she heard something about north shredding 
documents on one of the dozens of tv sets displayed where she worked 
but the judge brushed aside defense objections to inclusion of 
others notably a hospital laboratory technician who said she had 
seen north on television but couldnt remember anything he said 
usually i turned the channel to another program she said 
north lawyer barry sullivan urged the judge to abide by the 
principle that no juror be seated who saw col north testify 
but gesell said i have to take into account your client was on 
tv a great deal under all kinds of circumstances she did say she 
saw him but she did not say she heard him 
another chosen for the jury pool a mental health administrator 
who has testified dozens of times in court said she hadnt paid 
much attention to norths testimony because she had just changed 
jobs 
simon objected to her selection calling her almost a 
professional witness he also said she received newspapers at her 
home that delved into norths testimony with such prominent 
headlines that she could not miss critical portions of his 
testimony 
at the start of the second day of jury selection gesell said he 
had not made up my mind but was considering whether obriens 
account of tuesdays proceeding provided an appropriate basis for 
a contempt action 
the judge said obrien who was not in court during gesells 
remarks but was there later took pains to tell viewers that if 
they watched the excerpts of norths congressional testimony they 
would not have to serve on the jury 
roone arledge president of abc news said in a statement 
distributed in new york correspondent tim obrien reported fairly 
and accurately what has been said in public regarding the north 
case the publics right to be informed need not conflict with the 
fair administration of justice last nights world news tonight 
segment informed our viewers about events already having taken place 
in public arenas they cannot now be erased 
norths admissions to congress cannot be used against him as 
evidence and gesell has ruled that no one who heard the former 
national security council aides congressional testimony could sit 
on the jury 
the judge plans to pick a panel of 50 prospective jurors before 
allowing prosecutors and defense attorneys to exercise an asyet 
unspecified number of peremptory challenges seven were picked 
tuesday at the end of wednesdays session gesell said questioning 
had gone very well and he hoped to move for jury selection on 
monday 
defense lawyers for the retired marine lieutenant colonel did not 
object to seating an army sergeant who served from 1963 to 1978 had 
a top secret security clearance and was in vietnam during the tet 
offensive 
the man now works in a security job and said he didnt recognize 
north a decorated fellow veteran of the vietnam war

the target of foreign secret service plots to destabilize democracy 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos commented on a 
progovernment newspaper report that recent scandals were a plot by 
the cia to undermine socialist premier andreas papandreou whose 
government is driving a hard bargain in talks on a new us bases 
treaty 
greece has certainly been the target of foreign and domestic 
circles kostopoulos said at his daily press briefing he did not 
elaborate 
the avriani newspaper alleged that the cia and the mafia are 
orchestrating a plan to slander slander papandreou so that the 
removal of the american bases by 1999 will not be realized 
americans dont like him since he is not a yesman it said 
the us embassy refused comment 
the united states is negotiating a new military bases agreement 
with the greek government after an agreement expired in december 
thirteen rounds of talks have failed to resolve the major issues 
and another round is scheduled next month to determine whether four 
major installations remain or are closed down 
avriani said the alleged plot was based on the cia psychological 
warfare manual and involved using the political opposition and the 
press to slander the premier and to implicate government officials 
in scandals and crimes 
multimilliondollar financial and arms scandals have plagued the 
socialist government for months and have caused the resignation of 
seven cabinet members since november 
the entire political opposition has called for papandreous 
resignation so early general elections could be held before the 
governments term is up in june the prime minister has refused to 
step down and described the scandals reported by most of the daily 
press as slanderous 
the latest scandal broke out tuesday over how much was paid to 
buy 40 frenchmade mirage 2000 jet fighters 
the conservative new democracy party reported that the government 
said it paid 405 million for each aircraft when purchased in 1985 
the government however announced that the price was 194 
million and angrily denied antigovernment newspaper eleftheros 
typos allegation that papandreou kept some of the money earmarked 
for the purchase 
kostopoulos said this latest allegation was an example of a 
miserable scenario of slandering the premier

troops backed by helicopter gunships 
battled moslem rebels in a southern province and 43 people were 
killed the military said wednesday 
tuesdays battle in zamboanga del sur province about 500 miles 
southeast of manila was the bloodiest clash with moslem rebels 
since a ceasefire went into effect in 1986 
also a judge in manila on wednesday acquitted a former associate 
of expresident ferdinand marcos of rebellion charges in connection 
with an attempt to topple the government of president corazon aquino 
the aug 28 1987 coup attempt left more than 50 dead and was 
the most serious attempt to overthrow mrs aquino who became 
president after a popular and military uprising ousted marcos in 
1986 
the battle tuesday between philippine army troops and moslem 
rebels claimed the lives of 32 guerrillas eight civilians two 
government militiamen and one soldier 
reports said fighting erupted after about 300 rebels from the 
moro national liberation front and the moro islamic liberation front 
attacked the village of kulasian to avenge the deaths of some 
colleagues 
gunboats were dispatched to the area to prevent the rebels from 
escaping by sea reports said troops then conducted an air and 
ground assault 
both the moro national liberation front and the rival moro 
islamic liberation front have been fighting for moslem rule on 
mindanao and other southern islands since 1972 but fighting has 
been reduced to sporadic skirmishes since the guerrillas agreed to a 
ceasefire in 1986 
officials estimate that more than 50000 people were killed at 
the height of the moslem rebellion in the mid1970s 
in manila judge maximiano asuncion ruled there was insufficient 
evidence to convict former provincial gov orlando dulay of 
rebellion charges in connection with his takeover of the provincial 
capitol building in quirino province north of manila 
but the judge sentenced dulay to 10 months in prison and fined 
him 50 for trying to strangle thenquirino gov renicolas delizo 
and holding several employees during the takeover 
asuncion said dulays takeover of the building was not part of a 
public uprising necessary to convict him of rebellion the 
incident took place as more than 2000 mutineers led by renegade lt 
col gregorio honasan stormed the presidential palace and media and 
military facilities in manila 
at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded in 
the coup attempt honasan escaped from a prison ship with some of 
his guards in april and has not been found 
dulay had been held in a quirino jail since march 1987 in 
connection with the slaying of two aquino supporters during the 1986 
presidential election between marcos and mrs aquino 
witnesses testified that dulay was released during the coup 
attempt and dressed in combat fatigues led a force to the capitol 
building where he herded delizo and others into the governors 
office at gunpoint

a federal appeals court has ruled that a man 
charged in a mideast hijacking is not entitled to inspect classified 
transcripts of his conversations with an informant that were 
covertly recorded by the fbi 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
ruled that the trial judge in the case of fawaz younis was wrong in 
ordering the justice department to turn over the classified 
documents 
us district judge barrington d parker had ruled that younis 
charged with leading a 1985 hijacking of a jordanian airliner in 
beirut was entitled to see the transcripts of his conversations 
with jamal hamdan to prepare his defense 
the justice department had appealed parkers ruling contending 
that disclosure of the transcripts would jeopardize the intelligence 
methods used to intercept the conversations 
the appellate panel agreed saying the contents of the 
transcripts were on the whole not relevant to the defendants guilt 
or innocence and the few statements that were even marginally 
relevant were not sufficiently helpful or beneficial to the defense 
to overcome the classified information privilege 
the court in an opinion dated monday by judge david sentelle 
said the government had a legitimate nationalsecurity concern about 
releasing the transcripts 
much of the governments security interest in the conversations 
lies not so much in the contents of the conversations as in the 
time place and nature of the governments ability to intercept the 
conversations at all sentelle said in an opinion joined by judges 
stephen williams and laurence silberman 
things that do not make sense to the district judge would make 
all too much sense to a foreign counterintelligence specialist who 
could learn much about this nations intelligencegathering 
capabilities from what these documents revealed about sources and 
methods the court said 
the panel also chided parker for inadvertently disclosing 
classified information in his oct 25 1988 order which was quickly 
edited to delete the sensitive material 
because members of the federal judiciary and their staffs are 
generally not familiar with security procedures we think it wise 
that judges within this circuit direct their respective court 
security officers to review orders decisions and memoranda before 
they are released the court said 
younis was arrested in september 1987 after he was lured by 
hamdan aboard an fbichartered yacht off cyprus he is charged with 
leading a group of four other armed men who boarded a royal 
jordanian airline jet on june 11 1985 in beirut and forced the 
plane to fly to several locations in the mediterranean 
the hijackers blew up the plane in beirut after allowing the crew 
and passengers including several americans to leave 
the appeal made under the classified information procedures act 
is the second taken by prosecutors in the case the same appeals 
court last year overruled parkers decision that younis confession 
to fbi agents had been illegally obtained 
the case is scheduled to go to trial feb 14 but the proceeding 
could be delayed by further pretrial matters younis is being tried 
under a federal law that gives the government jurisdiction to 
prosecute hijackings overseas that involve americans

the number of cocaine babies born in illinois 
rose to 978 during the last half of 1988 a 788 percent increase 
over the same period a year earlier officials said 
we had predicted this but we were astounded that these numbers 
were increasing to the point that our fears were answered said 
gordon johnson director of the illinois department of children and 
family services 
cocaine babies are those who have had the drug in their 
systems either as fetuses or as infants ingesting it through their 
mothers breast milk said agency spokesman dave schneidman the 
babies arent addicted but the drugs effects may linger long after 
the narcotic itself is gone he said 
no end to the rise is in sight making it more expensive and 
difficult for the department to find foster homes for the children 
johnson said in a telephone interview wednesday from springfield 
the total of 978 cocaine babies for the last six months of 1988 
compares with 547 babies during the same period in 1987 the 
department said about ninthtenths of cases during both periods 
were in cook county which includes chicago and surrounding suburbs 
in addition to drug abuse the cases raise concerns about child 
abuse 
babies whose mothers take cocaine during pregnancy even once 
can be born with problems that make them harder to care for once 
they are home 
besides seizures and breathing problems such babies are 
irritable 
an addicted mother who comes home with a crying screaming 
baby is much more likely to abuse it or neglect it johnson said 
thats the kind of child that ends up in our system he said 
noting that recent increases in childabuse cases are partly 
attributable to drugaffected infants whose parents lose patience in 
caring for them 
drugaffected babies have a higher rate of premature birth are 
more likely to be retarded and are at an increased risk for crib 
death among other problems said dr ira j chasnoff director of 
the perinatal center for chemical dependence at northwestern 
memorial hospital 
the problem is not limited to big cities or states where cocaine 
is a notorious problem chasnoff said wednesday 
places youd never expect are seeing cocaineexposed infants 
he said citing boise idaho medford ore and peoria ill 
the numbers are escalating rapidly chasnoff said theres 
no question that stronger prevention programs have to be instituted 
across the country 
the national committee for prevention of child abuse estimates 
that 375000 babies or 10 percent of those born each year have 
illegal drugs in their system said deborah daro research director 
for the chicagobased group 
doctors and hospitals are required to report cocaine babies to 
the family services department schneidman said

a us team of experts and 50 tons of 
equipment headed to the antarctic on wednesday to battle a huge oil 
spill that experts said was killing wildlife in the pristine polar 
region 
a us air force cargo plane was bound for the southern city of 
punta arenas where the equipment will be transferred to a us 
research vessel the polar duke the us embassy in santiago said 
officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitude 
of the spill which was caused by a sunken argentine supply ship 
but said it represented the first major environmental threat to the 
antarctic 
the national science foundation in washington said the crippled 
argentine ship carried 250000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an 
incurable disaster would result if all the fuel leaked into the 
unspoiled waters in the region 
in buenos aires the argentine navy played down the spill and 
said it did not pose a serious ecological threat 
but us officials on wednesday launched a massive effort to stem 
the spill which was four miles in diameter and moving to the 
southwest said jack talmadge a spokesman for the national science 
foundation 
the spill occurred after the bahia paraiso paradise bay an 
argentine navy vessel ran aground on saturday in the bismarck 
strait about 600 miles south of the southern tip of south america 
and 1 miles from the us palmer research station in antarctica 
all passengers and crew were rescued but the vessel floated free 
in heavy seas and then capsized tuesday night spilling barrels of 
oil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water 
talmadge said 
it has leaked oil he said were not sure whether the oil 
leak is continuing the water surrounding the ship is covered with a 
couple of centimeters about an inch of oil there is a sheen of 
oil in a much wider area around the ship including evidence of oil 
on the coastline of the several islands there 
a private yacht 1015 miles away reported earlier that it had 
seen oil patches on the water he said oil also was spotted at the 
research station 
wildlife has already begun to be affected including krill 
the small crustaceans that form the basis of the antarctic food 
chain talmadge said 
birds which have eaten the krill are showing behavior 
differences he said one dead penguin had been found as of a 
few hours ago 
a national science foundation statement said about 12000 pairs 
of penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year 
in a few weeks hatchling penguins will leave their nests and 
enter the nowfouled antarctic waters as will their parents said 
the statement 
a team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant us air 
force c5b cargo plane left norfolk va on wednesday it was to 
arrive here on thursday and then go by ship across the drake passage 
to the accident site along the antarctic peninsula by monday 
talmadge said 
the national science foundation manages the us antarctic 
program which includes palmer station a scientific outpost 
talmadge said scientists from the station have been going out in 
boats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels and 
propane containers floating in the water 
were trying to get those but thats a pretty massive 
project he said were using all the lifeboats from the ship 
and any other boats we can get hold of in the area 
the national science foundation is organizing the cleanup 
mission with assistance from the us air force navy and the 
national oceanographic and atmospheric administration 
in buenos aires an argentine navy spokesman said there could 
be a small stain from the release of oil in the engine room of the 
ship anything else no he said 
the ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polar 
stations all 300 ship occupants were taken to the palmer station 
after the vessel ran aground 
another national science foundation spokesman in washington jack 
renerie said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane was 
carrying a 35foot skimming boat for scooping up spilled oil and 
pumping it into floating tanks a small tugboat inflatable booms to 
contain the spill and a special truck for loading and unloading the 
equipment 
he said it was accompanied by a crew from two private us 
cleanup companies marine polution control and global associates

prime minister yitzhak shamir on wednesday 
offered to withdraw soldiers from some cities in the occupied lands 
if palestinians agree to limited autonomy as an interim solution to 
the arabisraeli conflict 
palestinian leaders rejected the idea saying they would settle 
for nothing less than a palestinian state 
it was shamirs most conciliatory remark yet on israels future 
role in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
compared to his old stand he has moved a step but it is a far 
step from meeting the demands or conditions of the palestinian 
people we cant accept it said faisal husseini considered the 
top proplo leader in the occupied lands 
also wednesday 10 arab teenagers were wounded in clashes with 
troops in the west bank and gaza strip including a 13yearold boy 
shot in the head with a rubber bullet arab hospital officials said 
the army confirmed five wounded 
in the west bank town of hebron a firebomb was hurled at a 
religious seminary for jewish settlers a second firebomb was thrown 
at the troops that arrived to conduct searches settlers said there 
were no injuries or damage 
shamir presented his idea to reporters after speaking to a group 
of north american rabbis 
the peace process will be comprised of two stages he said 
first an interim condition and this will include full autonomy in 
the second stage there will be direct negotiations without 
preconditions between israel palestinian arabs and arab countries 
at a certain stage when there is autonomy the army will leave 
several urban centers and be focused in some other areas he said 
the withdrawal of israeli troops from populated areas into 
security pockets in the occupied territories is outlined in the 1978 
camp david accords between egypt and israel but shamir has never 
specifically endorsed such a troop movement 
although shamir spoke of full autonomy the accords say 
israel would still handle the terrorities external and internal 
security and foreign affairs 
the camp david accords call for electing local palestinians to 
participate in peace talks with israel jordan and egypt a 
fiveyear period of autonomy would precede negotiations on the final 
status of the territories 
the palestine liberation organization and many palestinians 
reject autonomy and the camp david plan saying these ideas are 
intended to sidestep the plo and cheat the palestinians out of a 
state 
autonomy as proposed by israel is totally rejected said 
bethlehem mayor elias freij responding to shamirs latest offer 
israel has to understand that we want a comprehensive peace 
settlement that will ultimately achieve our sovereignty over the 
west bank and gaza strip he said 
shamir told the rabbis he would never meet with the plo and 
criticized western nations for giving credibility to plo chief 
yasser arafats statements in december recognizing israel and 
renouncing terrorism 
our rights are questioned as we witness a large part of the 
world dancing at the ploarafat festival which has blinded them to 
reality and made them victims of delusions and deceptions he said 
while offering concessions in the political arena israeli 
officials have endorsed harsh army measures introduced last month to 
end the rebellion that began dec 8 1987 and has since left 370 
palestinians and 15 israelis dead 
the new measures allow soldiers to fire plastic bullets at 
palestinians fleeing riots and at those erecting roadblocks 
a gaza city military court tuesday sentenced six palestinians 
including two teenagers to up to two years in prison for stoning 
military vehicles and other targets no one was injured in the 
attacks 
the sentences were unprecedented in the past stone throwers 
were fined or given a few months in jail 
police arrested an israeli who allegedly planned to sell the plo 
information for 15 million israel radio said the 40yearold 
man whose name was not released allegedly met with plo officials 
in greece last month 
the man detained tuesday on his return at ben gurion airport 
near tel aviv passed information to the plo officials the radio 
said the report did not specify what kind of information was 
allegedly passed or whether any money changed hands no charges have 
yet been filed 
an israeli law passed in 1986 carries a threeyear prison term 
for unauthorized meetings with members of terrorist groups

the president of an oklahoma construction 
company testified wednesday that he bribed indian officials and 
pretended that a housewife of indian descent was the principal owner 
of his firm so he could get lucrative contracts to build indian 
housing 
kraig kendall president of kampt homes inc told an 
investigative panel of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
that the governments policy of requiring companies to have 51 
percent indian ownership to win indianrelated contracts was an 
invitation for fraud and fronts 
he also said his practice of giving gifts ranging from dinner 
hams to expensive sports cars to indian officials was standard 
procedure among those seeking construction contracts on lands of the 
absentee shawnee and chickasaw tribes 
kendall who pleaded guilty in 1985 to charges related to bribing 
a chickasaw governor said contracting now is in a shambles 
developers are all going to say we would prefer to go in and 
bid on a competitive basis i tried to do that kendall said 
but he said he was unable to get contracts that way and soon 
resorted to gifts and gratuities 
in some cases some serious bribes he said 
initially i wined and dined them and gave them small presents 
like turkeys and hams kendall said of his experience with 
officials of the absentee shawnee housing authority 
he said he offered the chairman of the authority and later the 
chairman of the tribe tickets to university of oklahoma football 
games 
after sending the two men to the orange bowl with about 500 in 
cash and paid hotel reservations kendall said he received a 
contract for a 50unit housing project on absentee shawnee lands 
eventually kendall said he made a deal to kick back 500 on 
every housing unit he built and gave a recreational van and a 
porsche as a means of continuing his contracting 
kendall described similar dealings with housing and tribal 
officials of the chickasaw nation saying he paid 94000 on phony 
invoices from the tribal governors construction supply 
manufacturing company in order to get 14 million in contracts 
the tribal governor overton james pleaded guilty in oklahoma 
earlier this month to accepting kickbacks and has been sentenced to 
prison 
kendall also said that in order to participate in bidding for the 
contracts he made an employees wife who had an indian relative in 
her ancestry a 51 percent owner of his company 
she was a housewife he said he said she never participated 
in company business except to sign papers 
the committee began its hearings into corruption in indian 
affairs monday and has been concentrating on the front 
operations 
donald asbra chief of the contracting division of the bureau of 
indian affairs testified that the agency accepts the contractors 
word that they are majority indianowned and does not investigate 
he said it is up to the indians to police themselves and that 
they can complain to the bia if they believe business that is 
supposed to go to native americans is going to nonindians 
we dont have the capacity to inspect fronts said asbra 
sen dennis deconcini dariz who chairs the investigative 
panel asked if cases involving suspected fronts could be stopped by 
bia officials at the local level asbra said that was possible 
the committee will be gathering information for several weeks on 
alleged corruption in many facets of indian affairs including 
gaming law enforcement education and possible sex abuse of 
children 
at one point the committee went into private session to hear 
testimony from richard ramirez who as former head of a navy 
program for small and disadvantaged business utilization said he 
had counseled participants in a minority setaside program 
established by the small business administration 
among those he counseled was kinross manufacturing co 
according to a statement released by the committee staff ramirez 
told the panel that kinross a michigan firm that manufactures 
munitions was an indian front company controlled by wealthy 
businessmen including some with connections to wedtech a 
scandalplagued bronx ny defense contractor 
ramirez has pleaded guilty to accepting a bribe in connection 
with the wedtech affair and is cooperating with the federal 
government in cases related to sba contractors 
he said kinross used one man as the applicant for admittance to 
the minority program though until 1982 the man was not enrolled in 
any indian tribe 
kinross applied for and received minority certification and then 
won multimillion dollar government contracts 
ramirez said he had never seen a startup company supported by so 
many government loans

federal investigators on wednesday for the 
first time blamed cocaine use by a pilot as a contributing factor in 
a commercial airline crash in which passengers were killed 
the national transportation safety board concluded that pilot 
stephen silver who was killed in a jan 19 1988 colorado commuter 
crash along with eight other people used cocaine several hours 
before the flight from denver to durango 
although board investigators said silver 36 did not have enough 
cocaine in his system to be high and his copilot was believed 
to be controlling the transcolorado aircrafts descent into 
durango the board concluded that cocaine contributed to his 
ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized approach the 
copilot ralph d harvey 42 was also killed in the crash the 
plane carried 15 passengers 
medical analysis found traces of cocaine in the pilots blood and 
urine investigators said they also said a girlfriend of the pilot 
reportedly claimed he had taken cocaine the night before the crash 
although she refused to talk to investigators 
board officials said it was the first time that cocaine use by a 
pilot had been ruled a factor in a crash involving a regularly 
scheduled commercial passenger flight alcohol use has been blamed 
in some previous accidents 
board investigator barry strauch said evidence showed that silver 
had used cocaine between 10 and 18 hours before the flight he said 
there was not enough evidence to determine whether silver was a 
heavy user of the drug 
board chemist merritt birky said that regular use of cocaine 
could cause fatigue and a preoccupation with cocaine affecting 
performance of a pilot long after the substance was no longer giving 
the user a high 
the fairchild metro 3 aircraft operated by nowdefunct 
transcolorado airlines crashed on a hillside five miles short of 
the durango runway in light snow 
the board concluded that the plane began its descent at too high 
an altitude and speed to land safely 
the board also said the pilot had falsely obtained a medical 
certificate required for flying by denying that he had a record 
involving drunken driving investigators said silver had several 
traffic citations including some involving drunken driving 
the board also said the copilot had a prior employment and 
training record that indicated deficiencies in performing 
instrument procedures the plane was landing at night in light 
snow and a cloud cover 
the probable cause of this accident was the first officers 
flying and the captains ineffective monitoring of an unstabilized 
approach which resulted in a descent below the published descent 
profile the board said in a report adopted after more than three 
hours of discussion in an open hearing 
contributing to the accident was the degradation of the 
captains performance resulting from his use of cocaine before the 
accident the board said 
the board recommended that the federal aviation administration 
require inspectors to personally examine special approaches such as 
the one into durango the approach is over mountainous terrain and 
sometimes referred to as a slamdunk approach because of the 
steep descent that is sometimes necessary 
board members said the faa should help airlines obtain more 
information from previous employers about the piloting skills and 
abilities of prospective pilots 
staff investigators told the board silver earned about 23000 a 
year and his copilot half as much board chairman james l kolstad 
characterized the salaries as incredibly low 
the board said there was no technical problem with the aircraft 
and air traffic control did not contribute to the crash 
but it said a ground proximity warning device if the plane had 
had one might have prevented the accident the faa is considering 
rules to require smaller passenger planes to install the devices 
which are used on all larger passenger airliners 
the ntsb last march released a toxicology report that showed 
silver had 022 micrograms per millileter of benzoylecgonine the 
principle metabolite of cocaine in his bloodstream 
the report also said he had 18 micrograms per millileter of 
metabolized cocaine and 022 micrograms of cocaine in his urine 
two negligence lawsuits have been filed against continental 
airlines as a result of the crash the plane owned transcolorado 
was leased to rocky mountain airways a continental subsidiary that 
flies under the name continental express 
one suit filed on behalf of laura lavigne wife of the late 
kevin lavigne of denver who was killed in the crash seeks 
unspecified damages because of the cocaine found in silvers system 
lavignes lawsuit also alleges the airline failed to check 
records of both silver and harvey which would have cast serious 
doubt upon the propriety of hiring those pilots 
the other lawsuit filed by relatives of the late don emergy cox 
of corpus christi texas also cites silvers cocaine use

a farmworker who claims he was framed in 
his 1968 conviction for poisoning his seven children has had his 
case taken up by the governor who called wednesday for a clemency 
hearing 
i am convinced there are still many questions about the 
richardson case that need answers gov bob martinez said at a 
news conference the interests of justice compel us to seek those 
answers 
james richardson 53 is challenging his murder conviction on the 
grounds that new evidence indicates he was framed and someone else 
has confessed to the killings 
his case given to dade county state attorney janet reno in the 
3monthold investigation because there is conflicting information 
in the case and she has subpoena power martinez said 
there were seven deaths we cant forget that martinez said 
seven little ones died and someone was found guilty if there was 
a wrongdoing at that time we would like to know about it justice 
ought to prevail whatever it may be 
three of the six members of the governors independently elected 
cabinet will have to agree with martinezs request for a clemency 
hearing before one can be scheduled 
the cabinet and martinez sitting as the board of executive 
clemency have the power to pardon richardson aides to four of the 
cabinet officers said their bosses had not yet been briefed on the 
case 
a fifth attorney general bob butterworth was ready to support 
martinezs request an aide said the sixth did not immediately 
return telephone calls 
the governors office and the florida department of law 
enforcement have been investigating the matter since october when 
the credibility of the 20yearold case came under scrutiny 
in december richardsons defense attorneys filed a petition in 
the florida supreme court seeking another trial because of new 
evidence and won a feb 9 hearing 
defense lawyers ellis rubin of miami and mark lane of washington 
dc contend prosecutors framed richardson and that a neighbor who 
frequently babysat with the children was the killer 
attorneys have said that if a new trial is granted the passage 
of time may make it impossible to assemble a credible case either 
for the defense or prosecution because witnesses have died and 
memories have faded 
when richardson and his wife were picking fruit on oct 25 1967 
their children aged 2 to 8 ate a lunch of beans rice and grits 
laced with the higly toxic pesticide parathion 
the lunch had been prepared ahead of time but was served by the 
neighbor at the familys arcadia home 
richardson is serving a life sentence in tomoka correctional 
institution near daytona beach he is eligible for parole in 1993 
he had been sentenced to death but that was reduced to life in 
prison when the us supreme court struck down the states 
deathpenalty statute in the early 1970s 
prosecutors said he murdered all seven children but he was 
convicted of only one firstdegree murder count in may 1968 for the 
death of his 8yearold stepdaughter 
the petition for a new trial includes claims that evidence was 
withheld also his attorneys say they have statements from two 
nursing home employees caring for the former neighbor 67 that she 
admitted killing the children

a page of calculations made by admiral 
robert e peary provides no evidence that he faked his claim to have 
reached the north pole in 1909 a nonprofit navigators group said 
wednesday 
the findings by the navigation foundation leave open to scholarly 
debate whether peary reached his destination 
properly understood this worksheet says absolutely nothing 
about whether peary reached the pole said retired rear adm 
thomas d davies president of the foundation which was 
commissioned by the national geographic society to look into the 
peary controversy 
the paper provides no evidence peary faked his claim davies 
said in a presentation at the naval academy planetarium complete 
with laser images to highlight the star betelgeux that he believes 
peary used as a guide 
pearys claim has had many detractors one of the most vocal is 
dennis rawlins an astronomer and historian who grabbed headlines 
last fall when he concluded that peary lied about his location and 
used betelgeux a star that wouldnt have been visible when the sun 
was up 24 hours a day to hide the truth 
suggesting peary might not have reached the pole is one thing 
declaring him a fraud is another said gilbert m grosvenor 
president of the national geographic society which helped 
underwrite pearys 1909 expedition in attacking rawlins contention 
after publishing a 1970 article and a 1973 book arguing that 
peary was off course rawlins went further last october saying the 
worksheet unsealed in 1984 showed peary 121 miles shy of his 
destination 
davies said three experts determined the calculations likely were 
made in february 1906 during an earlier arctic expedition not april 
1909 as written on the envelope in which pearys wife apparently 
placed them 
davies said rawlins interpreted one set of numbers as compass 
readings when they were serial numbers of the watchtype 
chronometers peary carried with him 
rawlins assumes that the worksheet shows altitude observations 
of the sun taken on april 7 1909 when peary says that he was at 
the pole davies wrote in the foundations report rawlins 
analysis is clearly incorrect the numbers rawlins assumes are 
degrees minutes and seconds of arc can also be interpreted as 
hours minutes and seconds of time he wrote 
rawlins interrupted the meeting to defend himself calling the 
navigation foundation report a very competent presentation and 
admitting his error on the chronometer serial numbers 
in terms of the national geographic versus me this is one 
for the geographic he said 
however he maintained that the readings were taken in 1909 and 
said he has 10 pieces of evidence that peary didnt make it to the 
north pole 
davies said the foundation will review other data and the peary 
archive as it continues to evaluate pearys claim 
wally herbert a british explorer writing in the september 1988 
issue of national geographic found that peary was 30 to 60 nautical 
miles off course rawlins found peary came no closer than 121 miles 
from his goal but because of difficult conditions and low supplies 
felt pressured to say he had reached the north pole 
retired cmdr edward p stafford of chester md pearys 
grandson defended his grandfathers integrity he was accurate 
he has always been shown to be where he said he was when he said he 
was stafford said

andrei d sakharov said wednesday that his defeat 
in a bid to represent the academy of sciences in a new soviet 
parliament showed the academys ruling presidium is not ready for 
democratic reform 
but pravda the communist party daily rejected suggestions that 
undemocratic procedures were used to block sakharovs nomination 
the 67yearold dean of the soviet human rights movement again 
has become a controversial figure in moscow but this time he is 
being both criticized and defended in the staterun press that once 
either ignored or vilified him 
a band of sakharovs supporters called a meeting for thursday to 
protest his jan 18 electoral defeat although he was nominated two 
days later as a parliamentary candidate from a moscow district 
sakharov is among several thousand candidates for the new 
2250seat congress of peoples deputies a parliamentary body that 
will be elected in march and which will in turn elect a fulltime 
legislature and a president 
there is little doubt president mikhail s gorbachev who 
proposed creation of the new parliamentary body will be reelected 
head of state 
sakharov was quoted in the weekly literary gazette a newspaper 
popular among soviet intellectuals as saying the nominating process 
in the academy of sciences worked well at the lower level where 
younger scientists hold sway 
but when the leadership made its final picks he said only top 
administrators were picked to represent the prestigious academy in 
the new parliament which will have representatives from both 
geographic districts and from professional political and social 
organizations 
he charged the leadership failed to fulfill its legal obligations 
and ignored the popular will in selecting its candidates 
pravda however said the meeting at which sakharov was defeated 
was not only fully democratic but benevolent 
after his defeat in a bid to represent the academy he won the 
overwhelming support of members of his own institute as a candidate 
for a seat in the district where the academy is located 
sakharov is a physicist who helped develop the soviet hydrogen 
bomb and later won a nobel peace prize for his human rights 
activities 
the government newspaper izvestia meanwhile criticized sakharov 
for suggesting in an interview with the french newspaper le figaro 
that gorbachev could be toppled or stymied by soviet conservatives 
it said such statements unsupported by solid information cause 
confusion and uncertainty and can only harm gorbachevs reforms

scotland yard said wednesday that it investigated 
claims nazi war criminal rudolf hess was murdered in a west berlin 
prison contrary to the official ruling that he committed suicide 
a scotland yard spokesman who refused to be identified in 
keeping with british custom refused to comment on the outcome or 
any other details of the investigation by its serious crimes squad 
made at the request of the director of public prosecutions 
the dpp asked us to investigate suggestions that hess did not 
die by his own hand scotland yard said in a brief statement a 
preliminary report has gone to the dpp for his decision on whether 
any further action is needed 
the statement did not say why scotland yard which coordinates 
national police work was asked to investigate the possibility of 
murder 
the director of public prosecutions directs the crown prosecution 
service which handles the prosecution of criminal proceedings begun 
by police forces 
hess family believes hess adolf hitlers deputy held by allied 
nations in a prison in spandau in the british sector of west berlin 
did not commit suicide but was murdered aug 17 1987 at the age of 
93 
the spokesman said scotland yard did not investigate a british 
doctors claims that a hess impostor was murdered in the prison 
it would appear from this scotland yard statement that we 
accept the premise that he was who he said he was he said 
dr hugh thomas who has written two books on hess says hess was 
murdered while flying to scotland on a peace mission in 1941 and 
that an impersonator in a second plane was substituted by plotters 
among hitlers deputies 
hess parachuted alone into scotland on may 10 1941 but concerns 
about his identity were raised even then 
thomas said he has seen unpublished reports of two autopsies and 
unpublished photographs of the body in spandau showing marks on the 
neck inconsistent with a suicide hanging 
the autopsies he said also supported his contention that the 
prisoner did not bear scars of a severe chest wound hess suffered in 
world war i 
he alleges that the prisoner was murdered to stop the leak of 
details of a world war ii plot by powerful britons to overthrow 
prime minister winston churchill 
thomas a surgeon who was a british army doctor when he examined 
the prisoner in spandau in 1973 first made his claim that the 
prisoner was not hess in his 1979 book the murder of rudolf 
hess the other book he wrote on the subject prisoner no 7 
was published last year

hud secretarydesignate jack kemp accepted 
thousands of dollars in speaking fees in excess of the limits set by 
house rules and federal law according to his own financial 
disclosure statements 
in all kemp accepted or agreed to 67350 above what house rules 
allow his statements show 
the associated press learned wednesday that when confronted with 
the apparent violation the former congressman from buffalo ny 
agreed this week to return 16000 in speaking fees and to forgo 
another 39400 in fees not yet received 
he also deferred receipt of an additional 12500 in fees earned 
in 1988 until 1989 to avoid violating the limits on honoraria 
congressmen can receive in any one year the actions brought kemp 
550 below his 1988 limit 
a spokeswoman for kemp mary brunette described the problems as 
just a misunderstanding a key senate aide said kemp had 
mistakenly believed that money received after kemp left congress did 
not apply to house limits 
kemp filed an amended financial reporting form with the senate 
banking housing and urban affairs committee and the us office of 
government ethics this past monday to reflect the changes the 
changes were made without public disclosure by either kemp or the 
senate committee until ap noticed the problem in its review of 
kemps financial statements 
the committee has scheduled a vote to confirm kemp an 
unsuccessful 1988 republican presidential candidate as secretary of 
housing and urban development on thursday 
the staff director for the democraticcontrolled banking 
committee kevin gottlieb confronted kemp personally last week with 
the form showing excess income for 1988 he said kemp who retired 
from congress on jan 2 after 18 years in the house said he was 
unaware he had violated the limits on honoraria and cooperated fully 
kemp was subject to the house rules limiting all outside income 
including honoraria to 30 percent of his 89500 congressional 
salary or 26850 in addition less restrictive federal statute 
limits honoraria to 40 percent of congressional salary or 35800 
in his original filing kemp reported receiving 119000 in 
honoraria for 1988 he also reported giving 24800 of it to 
charity which under house rules is not counted against the limit 
house rules also limit honoraria fees for speeches or similar 
appearances to no more than 2000 per event 
in his original filing kemp reported several honoraria well in 
excess of that 2000 limit he reported receiving 30000 for two 
appearances on the television show firing line in september and 
october and 10000 each for speeches to hartford university ab 
laffer and associates and the us chamber of commerce he also 
reported receiving 5000 from world trade assoc and 2400 from 
crosby assoc 
gottlieb said that kemp told him he believed the limits did not 
apply because he was leaving congress and would not receive the 
checks until after he was out of office 
he thought that once the monies were received after he was a 
member of congress that the limit didnt apply gottlieb said 
well clearly the limit does apply and when it was pointed out to 
him that it does he turned around and made the appropriate 
adjustment 
as a result he said kemp agreed to return 8000 each to 
hartford university and the us chamber of commerce and to reduce 
his firing line fee to 2000 per appearance or 4000 
he also agreed to reduce the fees for world trade and laffer to 
2000 each and to forgo altogether the crosby fee brunette said 
because the totals still would exceed the overall house limit on 
honoraria kemp shifted fees totaling 12500 to 1989 when he said 
he actually received or will receive them according to both 
gottlieb and brunette that gave him a 1988 honoraria total of just 
over 26000 and within the limit they said 
gottlieb said that after consulting with staff of the house 
ethics committee he decided house rules permitted honoraria to be 
counted in the year actually received even though earned in a 
different year

nasa said wednesday night it is 
delaying the launch of discovery from late february to midmarch to 
replace three suspect turbopumps whose failure could be fatal to a 
shuttle and its crew 
the announcement came following a highlevel meeting of shuttle 
managers who have debated for several days whether to pull the 
highspeed turbopumps which transform liquid oxygen into gas in the 
spaceships main engines 
officials said discovery will be transported to the launch pad 
early friday and switching of the pumps will be done there in 
parallel with other operations the first pump could be pulled as as 
early as sunday 
because of the uncertainty of the availability of new pumps and 
the length of time to make the replacements nasa said it would not 
set a firm launch date until a flight readiness review in late 
february 
it said the earliest the launch could take place would be in 
midmarch the agency had been aiming for a feb 23 liftoff but a 
series of technical delays not related to the pumps already had 
delayed that date several days 
if the date slips past midmarch the planned april 28 launch of 
atlantis with the magellanvenus probe would also have to be 
delayed officials said 
the three turbopumps became questionable when engineers 
discovered two tiny cracks in a bearing unit in one of atlantis 
pumps after it completed the second postchallenger mission in 
december 
the engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion 
resulting from moisture trapped inside the bearing housing during 
the manufacturing process but they are not certain how the moisture 
penetrated the metal 
officials became concerned when it was learned that two of 
discoverys pump bearings had gone through the same manufacturing 
process as the cracked one 
they decided at wednesdays meeting to remove all three pumps and 
replace them with new carefullyinspected units 
the turbopumps operate in flight at extremely high speeds 
pressures and temperatures and a failure of one of them could set 
off a fatal engine explosion the cracks on atlantis were too small 
to cause trouble but if such cracks widened and split the bearing 
unit it could be dangerous nasa said 
the agency has said the atlantis mission in april has priority 
over the launch of discovery with its communications satellite and 
that it would scrub the discovery flight until later in the year if 
it cant get off the pad by about march 15 
thats because the atlantis astronauts have only a 25day launch 
window that is favorable for dispatching magellan to venus earth 
and venus will not be in proper alignment again until 1991 
nasa said it could delay the atlantis flight a few days but 
thats something it would not like to do it would like to preserve 
the entire launch window in case of problems 
only one shuttle launch pad is currently available a second is 
being refurbished

a lebanese imprisoned for trying to kill of a former 
iranian prime minister urged iran on wednesday to insist on his 
release implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to 
freedom for three french hostages in lebanon 
the french government last year denied widespread reports that it 
won the hostages release in part by agreeing to pardon anis 
naccache who led four other proiranian attackers in a failed 
attempt to kill shapour bakhtiar irans last prime minister before 
the islamic revolution 
naccaches appeal was made in a statement issued late wednesday 
night by his lawyer antoine comte 
french foreign minister roland dumas plans to go to iran on 
sunday for the first highlevel visit since diplomatic relations 
were restored last year as part of the hostage deal 
i ask the iranian government which guaranteed the accord 
between france and the parties concerned during the liberation of 
the hostages to remind france of its engagements the statement 
said it is inadmissible to say that relations between the two 
countries are good while five soldiers of islam are still in french 
prisons 
naccache and three other men were sentenced to life in prison for 
the july 1980 assault on bakhtiar which left a bystander and a 
policeman dead and three other police officers wounded 
the fifth member of naccaches team got a 20yearsentence 
bakhtiar who lives in exile in paris was not hurt 
french authorities believed that naccaches orders to assassinate 
the former prime minister came from senior iranian officials 
while france was seeking to win freedom for its hostages in 
lebanon president francois mitterrand said publicly that he would 
be willing to pardon naccache but only as part of a deal in which 
all french hostages were freed 
last may when journalist jeanpaul kauffmann and diplomats 
marcel carton and marcel fontaine were released by their proiranian 
captors in beirut mitterrand and thenpremier jacques chirac denied 
that naccaches release was part of the deal 
kauffmann carton and fontaine were held by a group called 
islamic jihad which is still holding some of the 15 western 
hostages in lebanon the longest held is american journalist terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
reports that france made important concessions to get its 
hostages back drew criticism especially in britain on the grounds 
that such deals could make it more difficult to win freedom for 
other hostages without making similar bargains 
french officials insisted they agreed only to restore good 
relations and to repay a 1 billion loan originally made by the shah 
of iran for a uranium enrichment plant and frozen after the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic revolution

two men accused of detonating a remotecontrol 
bomb that seriously wounded a sheriff were to be paid 20000 for 
killing him according to a federal document unsealed wednesday 
the sixpage federal complaint was made public one day after 
marshall k mcclendon 42 of slaughter and john tullier jr 23 of 
st amant were arrested in connection with the dec 15 bombing 
lafourche parish sheriff duffy breaux nearly died from shock and 
blood loss when his foot was nearly severed in the blast doctors 
say one of his deputies was also injured 
a few days before christmas mcclendon and tullier went to 
baton rouge to get paid for the bombing they returned to 
mcclendons barn with 8000 cash they were to receive an 
additional 12000 for a total of 20000 for the completed job 
the complaint said 
the information was provided by an unidentified source who knew 
both men and had talked with them about the bombing according to an 
affidavit that was part of the complaint the document does not say 
who wanted breaux dead or why 
more arrests are expected said mike hall special agent in 
charge of the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms office in new 
orleans 
the source cited in the complaint said mcclendon claimed to have 
placed the bomb in a paper bag next to the sheriffs car mcclendon 
said he set off the bomb after he saw breaux approach the bag and 
kick it the affidavit said 
the complaint said batf experts in atlanta determined that the 
bomb was a wooden box encasing two pipes loaded with explosives 
nails and bullets it appeared to have been detonated by a model 
airplane remote control device 
according to federal agents mcclendon is a former police officer 
in new orleans and baton rouge he also held a lafourche parish 
sheriffs office commission and was involved with a drug task force 
in the parish in the early 1970s 
tullier was described as an unemployed instrument fitter 
in a brief hearing in baton rouge wednesday a magistrate ordered 
the two men sent to new orleans for a bond hearing to be held in the 
next 10 days 
if convicted on bombing and conspiracy charges each man could 
get up to 25 years in prison and a 25000 fine said stewart allen 
another atf agent 
breaux 60 and deputy daniel leche 62 were injured as they 
left a christmas party for senior citizens at a civic center 
doctors were able to reconnect breauxs foot and predicted he 
would regain 90 percent use of it within a year he was discharged 
from the hospital last month leche was released after two days in 
the hospital 
in addition to the federal charges lafourche parish prosecutors 
wednesday charged the men with two counts each of attempted murder 
us attorney ray lamonica of baton rouge said the federal charges 
would be addressed first

state department officials on wednesday 
defended the agencys restrictions on blind persons who apply to 
become diplomats but the officials who spoke at a congressional 
hearing were treated derisively by an audience overwhelmingly 
composed of sightless persons 
under state department policy the blind may apply to become 
foreign service officers but in a policy change that became 
effective late last year they cannot use braille or receive help 
from readers when taking entrance examinations 
more than 100 blind persons crowded into the hearing of the house 
human resources civil service subcommittee and made clear through 
occasional snickers and groans their displeasure with two state 
department witnesses sent to explain the agencys position 
much of the hearing focussed on the case of avraham rabby who 
has been trying unsuccessfully since 1985 to become a career 
diplomat and who testified that the state departments treatment of 
him reflects either sheer ignorance or deliberate deception 
rabby who lives in new york city and has passed five state 
department entrance examinations is a graduate of oxford university 
in england with degrees in spanish and french and has a masters 
degree in business administration from the university of chicago 
he lived for 15 years in england and speaks in the cultured tones 
of a man accustomed to intellectual pursuits he has his own 
consulting business helping disabled people find employment 
rabby 46 rejected the suggestion that gestures such as winks 
and nods form part of the overall message a diplomat must assimilate 
and that therefore the profession is not suitable for a blind person 
no international treaty has ever been decided on the basis of a 
wink or a nod he said 
subcommittee chairman gerry sikorski dminn criticized the 
state department policy and the agencys decision to impose strict 
limits on the degree to which the two department witnesses could 
respond to questions 
the witnesses were charles stout a director in the state 
department personnel office and sheldon yuspeh coordinator of the 
handicapped employment program 
stout said it is difficult for the foreign service to accommodate 
blind persons because of the problem they have in working 
independently from official documents and the requirement that all 
career diplomats be available to serve worldwide on short notice 
including countries which have unfamiliar settings and cultures 
sikorskis position is that federal law requires all government 
and governmentassisted agencies to conduct employment practices 
without discrimination on the basis of handicap 
evan j kemp jr commissioner of the equal employment 
opportunity commission said congress should consider withholding 
state department appropriations if the agency does not demonstrate a 
more flexible attitude toward blind applicants

president bush offering a thousand apologies 
for the way i sound canceled one speech and drastically shortened 
another wednesday as he continued to battle a bad case of laryngitis 
bush who has had a cold for about a week and whose voice has 
been steadily deteriorating canceled a speech before the national 
association of religious broadcasters at a downtown hotel 
later in the day he lasted less than a minute in an appearance 
before a business group at the executive office building next to the 
white house before turning the microphone over to chief of staff 
john sununu who continued the speech in his behalf 
white house deputy press secretary roman popadiuk said bush 
backed out of the first speech because it was advisable that he 
rest his voice at this time 
but in the evening bush was well enough to host a a reception 
for more than 400 diplomatic heads of mission standing for more 
than an hour in a lengthy receiving line and then mingling briefly 
with the guests 
bush told reporters he was feeling much better after having taken 
antibiotics for an ear condition and was now only suffering from a 
hoarse voice 
its nice said his wife barbara he doesnt yell around 
the house 
hoarse voice aside bush was animated in his brief appearance 
before the annual meeting of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors 
thank you all very much for being here and a thousand apologies 
for the way i sound bush said 
victor kanners chairman of the organization told bush dont 
worry about it weve learned to read your lips 
sununu delivering bushs speech appealed to the organization to 
help rally support within the business community for the 
yettobeannounced deficit reduction proposals that bush will 
outline to congress on feb 9 
he also thanked the group for its early endorsement of bushs 
presidential candidacy 
bushs voice has been getting worse by the day 
at a speech tuesday in norfolk va bush sounded very raspy 
later he joked that he had been just croaking away and had 
worried during the speech that he would not be able to complete it 
despite his cold bush went to work about 715 am wednesday and 
had a series of appointments extending past 5 pm bush and his 
wife barbara were to host a blacktie reception for the diplomatic 
corps at the white house

heard the one about the twoheaded snake 
that couldnt agree on which head got to eat dinner 
its no joke if youre talking about the twoheaded black rat 
snake named im for instinct and mind that has been 
under observation at the university of tennessse here since shortly 
after its birth 12 years ago 
if one head gets a good grip on the head of the mouse and the 
other gets a good grip on the tail they can fight for hours unless 
you stop them said gordon burghardt who teaches psychology and 
zoology at the university 
theyre simply fighting for the privilege of swallowing the 
mouse he said wednesday the prey in their twicemonthly meals 
he noted ends up in the common stomach 
im is showing researchers whether over time animals can learn to 
share he said we found the left head ate more prey but it was 
smaller and the right head ate fewer prey which tended to be 
larger he said 
over five years the weight of the prey eaten was identical 
for both heads so the animals were in some sense splitting the 
resource we didnt expect that he said 
the university got im from nearby oak ridge national laboratory 
where two boys found the animal in their familys garden 
back then the two heads really had two separate identities 
said jerry klein a research engineer and amateur herpetologist at 
the oak ridge lab if one wanted to eat it would try to keep the 
food from the other 
burghardt said the animal also is providing clues on theories of 
motivation and cognition we can test out some ideas in 
motivational psychology that we normally couldnt such as why do 
you stop eating he said 
one is do you stop eating when your stomach is distended or 
is the amount you eat determined by the effort in chewing and 
swallowing 
were still analyzing at this point but the indication is that 
the animal ims left head or right head that swallows is somewhat 
less responsive afterward than the one that hasnt that suggests 
that the act of eating plays some role on the regulation of food 
intake

most western and neutral diplomats in 
afghanistan believe president najibs government will fall by july 
without soviet military support the senior envoy from the closed 
us embassy in kabul said wednesday 
theres no support there among the people jon d glassman 
told a news conference the day after the last 11 us embassy staff 
members left the afghan capital 
the regime in many senses is like a building without its 
girders said glassman who was charge daffaires at the embassy 
for the last 18 months i think theres a general consensus among 
most informed observers that the life of the regime is likely to be 
short 
in london afghanistans top diplomat to britain contended that 
government forces have been stockpiling arms to defeat the 
insurgents 
afghanistan will use arms it has so far refrained from using 
afghan charge daffaires ahmad sarwar told a news conference at the 
house of commons he would not elaborate 
the soviet union which sent troops to its southern neighbor nine 
years ago to prop up a teetering marxist client government is in 
the final stages of withdrawing troops who numbered 115000 a year 
ago 
only about 15000 soviet soldiers remain in afghanistan 
according to western and soviet diplomats they are to be gone by 
feb 15 under a unsponsored accord 
when asked how long najibs forces can hold out against moslem 
guerrillas in the snowcovered mountains surrounding kabul glassman 
said this is a work for a crystal ball 
but he added in kabul most of the western and neutral 
diplomats are betting between now and july 
the united states closed its embassy on monday citing fears that 
security will deteriorate because of the soviet departure the west 
german embassy shut down saturday several others are expected to 
follow suit within a few days and others have sharply reduced the 
size of their stafs 
sarwar said countries that have shut their missions in kabul had 
not been in danger 
we believe they are leaving as part of psychological warfare 
waged against the afghan people for the last 10 years he said 
these countries may really wish to turn kabul into a land of 
rubble 
glassman rejected those accusations made previously by other 
afghan government officials i think the evolution of events are 
foreordained already by 10 years of war 10 years of foreign 
intervention and the peoples objection to that 
he said anyone looking for physical existence that najibs 
government is faltering need only look to the salang highway 
kabuls food and fuel lifeline to the soviet union and afghanistans 
fertile northern plains 
the road can easily be blocked by the guerrillas he said 
on jan 23 soviet and afghan government forces launched what the 
us state department described as a scorched earth policy on 
villages along the salang highway the only land route for soviet 
troops leaving kabul 
diplomatic and guerrilla sources said hundreds of afghan 
villagers died in the coordinated campaign of bombing raids 
artillery attacks missiles and ground assaults 
sarwar said the battle with the guerrilla forces of rebel 
commander ahmad masoud followed a refusal by masoud to keep the 
highway open 
it has proved to our people who our real friends are sarwar 
said of the battle 
our friendship with the soviet union will continue on a much 
warmer and wider scale he added

air force personnel used numbered flags 
wednesday to map a wreckagestrewn area where a fuelladen tanker 
crashed but the investigation may be hampered by the lack of a 
flight data recorder and the apparent loss of many maintenance 
records 
all 19 people aboard the kc135a stratotanker died when it 
crashed on takeoff about a halfmile south of a dyess air force base 
runway tuesday 
the kc135a tanker based at ki sawyer air force base in 
michigan stopped at dyess en route to a training mission it was 
scheduled to refuel some f16s in the air before flying to hawaii 
and then guam 
the plane was was carrying military members and their dependents 
as well as 30000 gallons of jet fuel officials said 
air force workers wednesday used stakes and red flags to map out 
about 2 square miles of scorched grassland and woods around the 
crash site said master sgt al dostal a dyess spokesman 
once its staked out it can snow and these flags have numbers 
they can still see where things are dostal said 
sam matta an abilene justice of the peace who spent tuesday at 
the site to record deaths said the plane was in many pieces the 
largest of them the tail section 
there were a bunch of small pieces everywhere matta said 
theres a few big sections 10 to 12 feet long theres a big 
wing pretty badly burned 
the last two bodies were found tuesday evening on wednesday the 
bodies were taken to the dyess base hospital and the air force 
released the victims names 
the flight manifest showed 17 passengers from sawyer and two 
from dyess dostal said seven were crew members four were active 
duty military members four were retired military and four were 
dependents including a boy about 7 he said officials said 
servicemen and women retirees and dependants are allowed to take 
routine flights if space is available 
members of the air force accident investigation board began 
arriving at dyess late wednesday 
their investigation could be hampered by the fact that no flight 
data recorder or cockpit voice recorder was aboard the modified 
boeing 707 said 1st lt john ames deputy chief of public affairs 
at dyess 
tech sgt alan dockery of the strategic air command in omaha 
neb said the recorders are not deemed necessary on flights such as 
the tankers training mission 
few military aircraft carry the recorders especially older 
planes such as the tanker dockery said flight recorders known as 
black boxes werent in use 26 years ago when the plane was built 
he said the conversation between the plane and the dyess traffic 
control tower had been recorded at the tower and would be turned 
over to investigators 
officials at sawyer said the planes maintenance files were 
aboard before it crashed and their loss also could handicap the 
investigation 
its fairly common to carry maintenance records on the aircraft 
when its going to be deployed for an extensive period of time in 
this case approximately six weeks some of those are duplicated 
but not all so the board will have a little harder time because 
those records were being carried on the plane sawyer spokesman 
capt paul bicking said 
one witness to the crash skeet jackson said the plane never got 
more than about 60 feet off the ground but air force officials 
refused to speculate on what might have caused the disaster 
that left wing hit the ground and crashed just like these 
pictures of atomic bombs youve seen jackson said the engines 
were backfiring or popping he the pilot made a sharp turn and 
crashed 
maj suzanne randle spokeswoman at strategic air command 
headquarters in omaha neb said the kc135a could fly if one of 
its four engines was out its ability to fly with even less power 
would depend on a number of factors including weight temperature 
pressure and altitude ms randle said 
the air force said the plane that crashed had been in service 
since 1963 and was still carrying its original pratt amp whitney 
enginesthe kc135 is the backbone of the air force tanker fleet 
which has about 500 of them averaging 29 years of age 
military officials said the plane that crashed was carrying about 
155000 pounds of fuel the kc135a has a capacity of 187000 pounds

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and 
his chinese counterpart qian qichen began talks thursday on a summit 
aimed at healing the 30year breach between beijing and moscow 
i would now like to warmly and formally welcome you qian 
said in opening remarks at the great hall of the people 
after arriving wednesday shevardnadze said in a written 
statement in english distributed by the soviet embassy we have 
stepped on the soil of the peoples republic of china full of good 
expectations and great hopes 
he said he hoped to finalize preparations for a meeting between 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev and chinese leader deng xiaoping 
and set an exact date with the chinese 
both sides have indicated they want their leaders to meet in the 
first half of the year 
we are convinced that the summit will open a new chapter in the 
history of two neighboring countries said shevardnadzes 
statement 
he arrived on a special plane of the soviet airline aeroflot at 
beijings old airport now used only by top chinese and foreign 
leaders he was met by qian 
the two men shook hands warmly as they stood bareheaded in a 
biting wind 
shevardnadze did not read his statement but he told reporters he 
was carrying a letter from gorbachev to chinese leaders he did not 
reveal the contents 
i reached an agreement in principle with my comrade qian qichen 
in moscow on holding a summit he said now were going to talk 
concretely about the matter 
qians visit to moscow in december was a major step forward 
shevardnadze said in his statement

following day with deng the chinese leader is in the east coast 
city to celebrate the upcoming lunar new year 
we are starting our negotiations fully aware of the scale of 
the forthcoming event said the soviet minister the title theme 
of the sovietchinese dialogue is peace and development 
the soviets have been courting china for several years to heal 
their longstanding ideological and political quarrel but only in 
the past year has china shown equal eagerness 
this has been prompted by changed soviet policies and a sense 
that not much time remains for deng who is 84 
cambodias 10year occupation by vietnam still is the chief 
regional conflict at issue 
but vietnam under apparent pressure from the soviet union its 
main ally said last month it is willing to pull out by september 
china agreed in principle to end its aid to cambodian rebels by then 
two other issues that blocked chinesesoviet reconciliation also 
appear nearing resolution the soviet union is scheduled to complete 
its troop pullout from afghanistan in two weeks and has announced 
plans to withdraw some troops from mongolia its ally on the chinese 
border 
the last soviet foreign minister to visit beijing was andrei 
gromyko who accompanied nikita khrushchev in 1959 the next year 
the two countries split bitterly over leadership of the world 
communist movement and a border dispute

vice president dan quayle arriving 
wednesday on his first visit to latin america discussed antidrug 
efforts with colombias president declared staunch us opposition 
to any latin debtor cartel and got a birthday serenade from us 
embassy workers 
the vice president arrived a day before inaugural ceremonies for 
venezuelas new president carlos andres perez his first of several 
scheduled bilateral sessions was with virgilio barco of colombia 
quayle mostly listened as barco talked about how much colombia is 
doing to combat drugs and guerrillas and how much help they need 
from the united states said quayles press secretary david 
beckwith 
he said quayle congratulated barco on those courageous steps 
but pointed out that us resources to help out are limited 
following the meeting quayle commented we had a very good 
discussion ive got a very good feel for the colombians 
views 
later quayle met with perez and was to meet with outgoing 
president jaime lusinchi before attending a reception for us and 
venezuelan business leaders at the residence of ambassador otto 
reich 
quayle told reporters he viewed his trip the first foreign 
diplomatic mission for the bush administration and quayles first 
visit to latin america as a chance to meet with foreign leaders 
to eyeball them to get a feel where theyre coming from on some 
of these sensitive issues 
later addressing about 200 employees at the us embassy he 
said he had come to show the interest of the bush administration 
that we have in latin america and to show our enthusiasm for the 
development of democracy in central and south america and the 
caribbean 
the embassy workers presented him with a birthday cake decorated 
with a us flag and also a cupcake that they said symbolized the 
tight federal budget at home they sang happy birthday to the vice 
president who turns 42 on saturday 
entering the busy capital by motorcade quayle created a 
cacophony of hornhonking when he decided to stop and buy some 
bananas guavas and mangoes at a small corner fruit market 
stimulating the economy already he joked to reporters as he 
left the market having bought two bags of fruit 
quayle said on arrival that his primary mission was to be a 
cheerleader for democracy 
but the massive debts owed by venezuela and other latin countries 
was expected to dominate much of the discussion among some two dozen 
heads of state attending the inauguration 
quayle indicated the united states is maintaining a hard line on 
socalled debtor cartel movements to form a unified organization of 
third world nations that face huge national debts 
speaking to reporters aboard air force two just before landing in 
caracas quayle said such ideas are counterproductive 
were absolutely opposed to the idea of a debtors cartel 
quayle said our strong position is that a debtor cartel is a 
nonstarter 
venezuelas new president perez has indicated he will take a 
leadership role on the latin debt issue and has rejected a 
coordinated effort in which the latin countries would deal with 
their creditors 
venezuelas debt is about 303 billion on dec 31 the country 
joined many other debtor governments and suspended payments on the 
principal of most of that debt 
latin american countries owe more than 440 billion combined 
quayle said that during his talks with perez and other leaders 
the debt issue would certainly come up and he would voice us 
opposition to any cartel efforts 
quayle told reporters that he wasnt bringing a new initiative 
from the united states on the debt issue i will be there to 
listen to their concerns 
he said the bush administration is willing to hear suggestions by 
the latin leaders about how to solve the debt question 
after their meeting quayle and perez said they discussed the 
debt situation but gave no specifics 
quayle called the talk frank and candid saying im much 
more informed and i appreciate the meeting 
they said the subject of nicaragua also came up perez who 
supported the leftist sandinistas in their 1979 overthrow of 
nicaraguan dictator anastasio somoza has indicated he wants to take 
a leadership role in helping to resolve the nicaraguas current 
strife and further the regional peace efforts spearheaded by costa 
rican president oscar arias 
a source close to quayle said perez and quayle had a lively 
discussion during which they agreed to disagree on the debt 
question but agreed on the need work for democracy in nicaragua and 
panama 
quayles national security adviser carnes lord said the bush 
administration is not rejecting any coordinated effort by the latin 
americans to address their creditors the administration would balk 
at formation of an organization that would amount to a cartel but 
might be open to suggestions on other kinds of multilateral meetings

by the time he was 25 gary martin was an 
american success story a poor black kid from alabama who earned 
degrees from harvard college and columbia law school clerked for a 
federal judge and landed a job with a big miami law firm 
at 28 he was a story of another kind a homeless ivy leaguer 
wandering the streets of new york dressed in rags fishing through 
trash cans finally friends and former classmates hunted him down 
and convinced him to enter a counseling facility 
three years later gary martins story lacks a neat ending at 
31 he is neither back on the fast track nor back on the street 
after living for several years in an apartment provided by the 
bridge inc a mental health rehabilitation agency martin moved 
back to his mothers home in phenix city ala 
he spent two months working as a parttime law clerk but says he 
has no immediate plans to try to resume his career 
in a telephone interview martin said he was pretty much just 
trying to get used to being around here again 
getting to see home again is nice he said its quiet down 
here new york can be kind of a wild place 
it was a wild place for martin who arrived in spring 1985 soon 
after that his money ran out but exactly what drove him onto the 
street remains unclear although he appears to have been depressed 
he has described the period as a sort of urban camping experience 
martins problems seem to have begun in miami where he lost his 
42000ayear job after twice flunking the florida bar exam he 
moved in with some relatives in wilmington del and began a job 
search when things didnt work out martin headed to new york where 
he had attended law school 
after friends who had spotted him on the street obtained a court 
order for his apprehension martin agreed to accept room and 
counseling from the bridge 
for a month the homeless lawyer was news homeless advocates 
said his case showed the breadth of the problem people who learned 
of his plight offered money or jobs although martin clearly was in 
no condition to take advantage of the latter 
since returning to phenix city his only job has been a brief 
stint in the office of attorney michael bellamy bellamy identified 
with martin when he read about him in the newspaper three years ago 
he too had flunked the bar exam the first time he took it 
martin he said did an excellent job i gave him a brief 
to do and it was apparent he was real smart 
but bellamy said he could not afford to keep a clerk martin 
himself said the work there was not the best use for my type of 
law background 
he said he might take the bar exam again and try to get a job 
with a small law firm or a public interest organization preferably 
in atlanta or another large city 
martin still doesnt readily admit to having had a psychological 
problem asked about his time on the street he calls it an odd 
situation i was just trying to deal with a tough situation 
ive always been kind of a selfsufficient person 
george mcdonald a homeless advocate who helped link martin up 
with the bridge said martin always felt above everything there 
in phenix city he has rebuffed suggestions that he seek counseling 
mcdonald says this is not remarkable many homeless people must 
struggle to regain their equilibrium 
but in another respect he said martin is unusual he got 
help

a year after gaining the convictions of 
338 mobsters in italys socalled maxitrial a government drive 
against the mafia has lost momentum 
since those verdicts the mafia seems to have moved a step or 
more ahead of the state as the mob schemes to safeguard its 
interests which include billiondollar international drug 
trafficking and control of lucrative public contracts in developing 
southern italy 
investigators also suspect the king of the corleone crime family 
there actually is one comes and goes as he pleases in palermo 
sicilys capital and largest city 
the last photograph investigators have of the corleone leader 
salvatore riina is 30 years old and for all they know the man 
believed to be the most powerful mafioso in sicily today probably 
has had plastic surgery to change his looks 
alberto di pisa the chief antimafia prosecutor notes that the 
sicilians fear of mafia revenge and their mistrust of the state 
make it unlikely an ordinary citizen would turn riina in 
the corleone family gets its name from a sicilian town the 
american author mario puzo used that name for the main character in 
his novel the godfather and it was used as well in godfather 
movies while the corleone clan has its roots in the town its power 
base is believed to have shifted to palermo 
the claim that riina moves boldly and openly in parts of palermo 
was made on state television recently by salvatore totuccio 
contorno a mafiosoturnedinformer his testimony helped convict 
the 338 defendants many of them top mob bosses on murder drug and 
other charges in italys largestever case against the mob 
the interview was made in the united states where contorno lives 
under a secret identity provided by us authorities after he 
testified for them 
italian investigators ruefully acknowledge that the state of the 
antimafia front in italy is so dismal that contornos claim may 
well be true 
among the setbacks in the past year in the war against the mob 
the slaying of judge antonio saetta who had been assigned to 
hear the appeals of the maxitrial this year the mafia this decade 
has assassinated several investigating magistrates but until saetta 
was killed the mob left presiding judges alone 
a court ruling that prosecutors cant automatically try mob 
suspects in one mass trial on the sole basis that the mafia is 
directed by a palermobased commission which the state did in 
the maxitrial prosecutors say the ruling weakens their ability to 
present stronger more comprehensive cases that are more likely to 
hurt bigtime mob bosses 
for many prosecutors and police officials the appointment of 
domenico sica as the high commissioner against the mafia was 
virtually the only bright spot sica earned national fame as a 
prosecutor assigned top domestic and international terrorist cases 
but sica in a speech in january summing up his first six months 
as italys top antimafia fighter complained that he needs more 
experienced consultants and said the quality of information from a 
special intelligence unit at his disposal was unsatisfactory 
we cant provide a detailed picture of the mafia today said 
guido lo forte an investigating magistrate in a recent interview 
in palermos palace of justice 
he said the mob now appears to be circulating less and less 
important information within its ranks one way of eliminating the 
risk of witnesses 
at the same time the lack of a government witness protection 
program discourages potential informants two of informant 
contornos brothersinlaw were killed by the mob in palermo in 
recent months 
what investigators would especially like to know is new mafia 
strategies for avoiding tightened financial checks 
iron tower a joint usitalian investigation disclosed in 
december that south american cocaine was being sent to italy in 
exchange for heroin some of it shipped in liquified form in wine 
bottles 
according to investigators such bartering avoids incriminating 
bank records 
authorities say the sicilian mobs share of worldwide drug trade 
has declined in the past few years one reason is us and italian 
prosecution the other is competition from south american and asian 
crime syndicates 
the biggest chunk of mafia earnings today comes from political 
corruption and public contracts says pino arlacchi a sociologist 
who studies organized crime 
laws were enacted in the early 1980s requiring those bidding for 
public contracts to prove they had no mafia links but lo forte says 
the mob got around the restrictions in some cases by intimidating 
clean sicilian businessmen to front for mafia enterprises 
prosecutors also say that since the investigation that led to the 
maxitrial police work has yielded nothing of real substance four 
top antimafia detectives were slain by the mob in the last few 
years 
the mafia is also believed to traffic in arms but investigators 
say that business is minimal compared to drug operations rightwing 
terrorists have been linked to the mafia in alleged arms dealings 
but the relationship remains murky and some investigators say it 
appears to be overstated 
in late january italian authorities announced they issued 72 
arrest warrants in connection with an international ring in which 
the sicilian mob and rightwing extremists work together in drug and 
weapons trafficking among those arrested in raids was michele 
cillari considered the corleone familys cashier for his 
financial dealings

another religious voice this time from us and 
latin american methodist bishops has sounded a plea to governments 
to keep hands off nicaragua and be peacemakers and not 
peacebreakers 
after extensive talks there the bishops this week declared 
peace with justice is possible but must recognize each 
nations right to determine its own destiny without interference 
this is a long standing demand of most major christian 
leadership protestant and roman catholic in opposing outside 
mililtary intervention in strifetorn central america 
president bush says review of policy there and elsewhere still is 
to be completed and it takes a little time particularly since 
he wants a bilaterally supported policy there 
his chosen secretary of state james a baker iii says he 
doesnt think that on humanitarian grounds or moral grounds we can 
abandon the contras but should go slow on any more military aid 
to the rebel group 
i think its very very important that we move in a unified 
way here he said 
these remarks last week bush in a news conference and baker to 
a senate committee indicated new efforts to avoid the past keen 
partisan conflict over the matter and possibly new approaches to it 
bishop kenneth w hicks of topeka kan among those visiting 
nicaragua expressed hope the bush administration will take a 
diplomatic rather than confrontational approach toward nicaragua 
this has been a drawnout keenly divisive issue in america 
engendering demonstrations passions on right and left long 
congressional battles and narrow votes 
it has involved secret cia mining of nicaraguas harbor us 
provisions of arms to contra rebels and after such aid was 
suspended a scandal over continuing it through illegal military 
sales to iran 
during the eightyear civil war there since the sandinistas 
toppled a 40year dictatorship both mainline protestant 
denominations and the us roman catholic bishops have steadily 
opposed outside military intervention 
the methodist bishops 16 from the us united methodist church 
and 15 from latin american countries condemned the violence and 
violations against the people of central american nations as 
making peace impossible 
in a declaration of peace and solidarity issued last sunday 
in nicaraguas capital managua after five days of discussions with 
a wide range of nicaraguans high and low the bishops pledged 
we will demand and expect that our governments act with 
compassion and justice we will publicly challenge our 
governments to be peacemakers and not peacebreakers 
we will work for the development of policies that respect the 
sovereign rights of other nations to govern themselves without 
interference 
the bishops representing the us council of united methodist 
bishops and the episcopal council of methodist churches in latin 
america said they have seen nicaraguas war devastation and they 
urged negotiated settlements 
similar stands have been taken over the years by various mainline 
denominations presbyterian lutheran episcopal and other bodies 
as well as by the protestantorthodox national council of churches 
and catholic bishops 
they have supported us humanitarian aid but not military 
supplies the national councils governing board said last may such 
aid should be offered impartially strictly on the basis of need 
free from extraneous objective 
monsignor daniel hoye secretary of the us catholic conference 
says the bishops object to any aid to the contras except such 
humanitarian aid as food clothing and resettlement assistance while 
the peace process develops 
the methodist bishops added another point noting crippling debts 
of central american countries and urging swift renegotiation of 
these debts with favorable terms or total debt forgiveness 
hicks said the united states has a marvelous opportunity to 
help a country find its way for eight years our policy has been 
that help must conform to our provisions and nicaragua is not 
willing to do that 
if we want them to move out of the marxist bloc then we have to 
treat them as equals instead of as underprivileged children that 
need to be disciplined and chastized 
bishop c p minnick of raleigh nc said there was confusion 
among nicaraguans about why the united states as one nation under 
god would stand by and send no aid after the recent destructive 
hurricane 
however he said the country seems more relaxed than when he 
visited there with a factfinding church delegation in 1985 now 
there is not as much anxiety about terrorist contra activity

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev meets the 
ultimate capitalist jr ewing 
if larry hagman has his way the meeting will become a reality in 
march when dallas is tentatively scheduled to go on location in 
the soviet union and europe 
hagman as well as regulars patrick duffy cathy podewell sheree 
j wilson and george kennedy are tentatively scheduled to leave in 
march the final decision has not yet been made if its a go they 
will film scenes for dallas in the soviet union austria and 
west germany 
i have no idea what the story will be said hagman who this 
season became coexecutive producer of the series with leonard 
katzman i dont think well know until leonard finishes scouting 
the locations 
but russia exports more oil than any other country including 
saudi arabia and iran its their only source of hard dollars so i 
think jr may do a little dealing 
and might jr seek an audience with gorbachev dont think we 
arent trying if we could just touch flesh just once im all for 
it 
it wouldnt be the first overseas trip for dallas now in its 
12th season victoria principal and linda gray went to hong kong a 
few seasons ago 
itll be fun said hagman itll generate some interest 
hagman became coexecutive producer in september a title offered 
by lorimar television but he acknowledges its mainly an excuse 
they had to find some way to pay me more money he said it 
was a means of paying me the executive producers salary if you 
want to know the truth 
hagman declined to say what his salary is but said an estimate by 
entertainment tonight that he was making 150000 a week was 
below the mark 
the title makes me feel more powerful he said laughing i 
did pick my new leading lady this year i auditioned all the women 
and selected cathy podewell shes a joy 
jr married cally harper played by podewell earlier this 
season in a shotgun wedding 
discussing how long he would stay with dallas hagman said 
its a sinecure lets face it i enjoy it and i make a lot of 
money i work three days a week and laugh all day long they pay me 
what some countries make why move on the chance of another tv show 
making it is awfully tough and at my age why risk it 
and why should i go into movies i dont know of any movie 
actor who makes as much as i do im willing to stay with dallas 
as long as it goes on we entertain people millions of people watch 
this show 
hagman has used his influence both as star and coexecutive 
producer to change the direction of dallas he was instrumental 
in persuading patrick duffy to return to the show and in getting 
charlene tilton back in her role as lucy 
duffy left in 1985 after bobby ewing was struck and killed by an 
automobile hagman felt the tension between jr and bobby was 
missed duffy returned in 1986 in the famous dream episode in 
which his death and the entire season were explained away as a 
dream by pamela ewing victoria principal who played pamela has 
since left the series hagman also tried to get her to return 
i wanted to get the show back to the family said hagman i 
think its best when were all together the reason bobby and jr 
went to arkansas where jr ended up getting married was to get us 
out and doing something physical 
it got us out of sitting around the boardroom making deals 
therell still be that undercurrent but it has to be interesting 
maybe we can make a deal with the russians 
has jr changed over the years as an actor you sometimes 
paint yourself into corner you dont anticipate until later he 
answered jrs not as raw as he was hes still amorous he 
married this young girl

they used to call him wimp but as a beaten 
democratic rival tells it george bush is so tough now that he can 
gargle with water from boston harbor 
thats sen lloyd bentsens joke and it tells of the 
transformation that accompanies a political honeymoon president 
bush is enjoying his but hes been around he knows it wont last 
i dont expect its all going to be sweetness and harmony and 
light he said he addresses congress one week from tonight 
filling in blanks on his agenda especially on the budget deficit 
the minute we get those proposals up there i expect were 
going to have other firestorms swirling around he said 
the big bills run up by the government during the ronald reagan 
era are coming due and there is no painless way to pay them 
that surely will lead to some partisan spats but it doesnt mean 
the honeymoon will be over presidential honeymoons with congress 
usually last well into warm weather in washington and end gradually 
issue by issue 
gerald r ford the unelected president was an exception he had 
a months harmony and then pardoned richard m nixon for watergate 
not long ago there were suggestions that bush wouldnt get a 
honeymoon at all not after the long often negative presidential 
campaign the democrats surely wouldnt forget that they did 
almost immediately 
the change in george bush is impressive bentsen the 
democratic vice presidential nominee said at a stag blacktie 
dinner last saturday night this time last year he was being 
called a wimp now hes so tough he gargles with water from boston 
harbor bush was there to laugh at the ribbing about his campaign 
television commercial blaming democratic nominee michael dukakis for 
pollution in boston harbor 
bush said during the transition that campaign bitterness wouldnt 
last nobody remembers campaigns ads about willie horton he 
said then the countrys looking forward 
but the early bush honeymoon has been smoother than he could have 
expected it has been a time harmony and calm save for what bush 
called a few ripples one followed an administration suggestion that 
a fee on bank depositors might be the way to pay the price of the 
savings and loan crisis another was stirred by conservative 
republicans who questioned whether bushs nominee to head the 
department of health and human services really opposes abortion he 
said he does 
actually the flap over fees for an sampl bailout could serve the 
administrations interests that unpopular idea was floated early in 
the process alternatives could look better by comparison and the 
abortion controversy had more to do with conservative orthodoxy than 
with substance 
cabinet confirmation proceedings in the senate have produced more 
democratic praise than pointed criticism in the house speaker jim 
wright said he will not press senateapproved legislation that would 
compel presidents to advise congress within 48 hours of covert 
intelligence operations holding off on a mutual assumption of 
good faith with the new administration 
of such assumptions are honeymoons made 
president reagans was different since he held the political 
shotgun when he came to power in 1981 republicans had captured the 
senate and strengthened their house minority reagan was as powerful 
a campaigner in office as out he got congress to do his bidding by 
keeping the pressure on 
democrats kept pronouncing the reagan honeymoon over but he kept 
winning it was midsummer when his tax cut bill came to a final 
vote in the house and the president won decisively after a 
televised bid for support that swamped congressmen with telephone 
calls and telegrams 
never in my 30 years here have i see that kind of pressure 
said former speaker thomas p oneill jr 
president carter had a shaky honeymoon in unfamiliar territory 
he was the outsider and he tended to handle congress that way even 
though it was dominated by fellow democrats 
his first nominee to head the central intelligence agency had to 
withdraw or risk rejection by a democratic senate 
his early travels and appointments were set without advance word 
to democrats from the state involved he took on powerful 
congressional interests in an effort to cut back federal rivers and 
harbors projects and wound up with half the cut he sought after a 
long and politically costly battle 
while most of his major proposals were approved it never was an 
easy partnership

a fledgling company operating out of a 
10room house in this rural southeast iowa town claims it is 
enabling investors nationwide to track stock portfolios via cable 
television instead of relying on brokerages 
jeff blokker and eric randall cofounders of cablesoft said 
their product live wire consists of a specially designed computer 
keyboard that when hooked to cable tv finds the financial news 
network channel 
it reads the ticker tape that runs across the bottom of the 
television screen quoting prices of stocks from the new york stock 
exchange american stock exchange and overthecounter stocks the 
device converts the characters from the tv screen and relays them to 
the users personal computer screen 
besides tracking a particular stock a live wire user also can 
program at what price to buy or sell an alarm bell rings when that 
threshold is reached blokker said the device also can make 
longterm stock earnings calculations he said 
to comply with securities and exchange commission guidelines 
there is a 15minute delay from the time the quotes are issued by 
stock exchanges and the time they first appear on fnn 
but blokker called that a minor disadvantage since most investors 
get delayed stock information anyway from their brokers cablesofts 
live wire product costs about 1000 he said a onetime cost 
anyone who does interday trading on the average of more than 
five trades on a single day then you need realtime data if you 
trade once a day a 15minute delay data is fine blokker said 
most personal investors he said are now utilizing information 
services such as dow jones news retrieval or compuserve once a night 
to get stock quotes which they enter into their personal computers 
but cablesofts cofounders say their service is better because 
it provides quotes during the entire day 
cablesoft unveiled live wire this past summer at a trade show in 
new york 
they said we were the hit of the show because we were something 
new brandnew and totally unique blokker said 
the idea for live wire surfaced when blokker was working toward a 
doctoral degree in electrical engineering at the university of 
california at santa barbara he said he left school to join randall 
in a separate business venture that eventually collapsed 
we sat around for about a week wondering what should we do 
now so i remembered this old idea and we decided to try it 
blokker said 
blokker said he figured it would take about a year before they 
could start marketing live wire but it took four years instead 
cablesoft headquartered in a blue threestory 10room house in 
fairfield has 16 employees each live wire machine is still made 
individually but mass production is planned soon via a contract 
with vantronics a san jose calif manufacturing concern 
cablesoft began marketing live wire several months ago and has 
sold about 200 machines so far blokker said he envisioned big 
sales because there are an estimed 2 million people using personal 
computers to follow stocks 
if we can penetrate that market if we get 10 percent of that 
market that means weve sold 200000 units thats 200 million in 
cash flow thats a lot of money he said

in recent weeks some of the economys biggest 
fears including those allamerican worries about big trade and 
budget deficits have been attacked by critics as being overdrawn 
budget deficits they point out are no higher now than in many 
other years when measured as a percentage of gross national product 
besides unless we go on another spending spree they say we might 
even tame the beast in the 1990s 
and it is argued the equally worrisome trade deficit already is 
on the way to being alleviated if not corrected with export orders 
building and american companies showing daily evidence that they are 
competitive again 
on a larger scale serious questions have been raised about the 
inevitability of the economic cycle isnt it just economic 
nature for expansions to be followed by recessions maybe not 
some now say 
some of the reasoning in regard to the lesscyclical nature of 
the economy is interesting if not convincing rather than having 
national or global downturns it is argued we have downturns 
limited to regions or industries 
there is evidence for example that this very thing might have 
occurred in the us economy over the past six years or so we 
avoided a national recession it is said instead regional 
downturns relieved the pressure 
two years ago for instance many areas dependent on oil mining 
agriculture and certain types of manufacturing were indeed in 
recession but national statistics didnt show it because of east 
and west coast booms 
thus for official purposes the country never had a traditional 
recession in this period but sensible economic minds and millions 
of americans know very well that recessionary conditions existed for 
much of the country 
have the definitions and rules changed 
oldtimers will tell you that to toss out the old rules and the 
traditional assumptions is a step toward disaster just as soon as 
you get ready to abandon the old guidelines they say the old 
guidelines reassert themselves 
they observe for example that abandonment of old measures of 
values often accompany every explosive bull market in stocks only 
to be embraced again as prices plunge back to reality 
still there remains an important area where existing measures 
might indeed be out of whack americans it has been said for 
decades are among the worlds worst savers putting away only a 
fraction of what the japanese save 
from 1982 to 1987 the us savings rate was a mere 37 percent of 
gross national product compared with several times that in japan 
americans it was said were squandering their income instead of 
investing it in progress 
but several economists point out that demographics might have had 
something to do with this low rate and others most recently 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan suggest the definition of 
savings might be incorrect 
edward yardeni prudentialbache director of economics contends 
the baby boom bulge in the population a phenomenon that is destined 
to disappear has skewed the conventional savings rate 
as the baby boomers born after world war ii grow older they 
will become less active spenders he says their big expenses for 
education housing and the like will have been met they will have 
the ability and desire to save 
so convinced is he that this thesis is correct yardeni has gone 
way out on a limb forcasting a sharp rise in the savings rate from 
4 percent or so to 10 percent over the next five years 
paul craig roberts former treasury assistant secretary argues 
that there are methodological quirks in the calculation of savings 
rate and now greenspan adds further doubts about the accuracy of 
official savings rates 
greenspans question concerns a situation that at least on the 
surface appears to be contradictory down payments by buyers of 
houses are counted as savings but capital gains received by sellers 
of houses are not 
count those capital gains received by sellers of homes that have 
multiplied in value and you might see a very different savings rate 
for americans and a lot less criticism of their profligacy

closed down by president ferdinand e 
marcos in 1972 and reopened just over a year ago the philippines 
congress now is swept up in scandals 
hardly had the dust settled on a scandal involving firearms 
imports when members of the house of representatives were facing 
charges of trying to corner the export of coconuts to taiwan 
the senate also has come under fire for deciding to use 
taxpayers money to buy 35 foreign luxury cars for each of its 23 
members and certain staff 
just before the coconut scandal broke in late january columnist 
neal cruz of the daily globe wrote that the rubberstamp congressmen 
during marcos time look like saints compared to the members of 
this congress 
first some gunrunners in the house of representatives import 
hundreds of highpowered automatic firearms for the protection of 
congressmen and the rest for the lucrative black market he 
added just as the public heaved a collective sigh of relief that 
the senators are not involved in this caper comes the revelation 
that all 23 senators have ordered new cars 
the coconut scandal exploded jan 25 when the chairman of the 
philippine coconut authority claimed at least 12 congressmen were 
pressuring his organization to grant them exclusive rights to export 
4500 tons of fresh coconut to taiwan 
jose romero said the congressmen from four coconutgrowing 
provinces south of manila were insisting that the authority not 
only restore a quota system it had recently scrapped but also to 
partition the coconut export quota among themselves 
he said that until last year his agency awarded the entire quota 
to a group of filipino exporters but decided three months ago to 
stop the practice because of complaints from other groups the move 
was also in line with the governments policy of deregulation 
the congressmen led by rep leonardo guerrero claimed they 
simply were trying to protect the interests of small coconut farmers 
in their provinces from middlemen they claim had monopolized the 
export in the past 
guerrero chairman of the house subcommittee on edible crops 
denied romeros charges and accused him of receiving bribes from 
middlemen 
the uproar over the firearms scandal is not over even though the 
200member house cleared two congressmen of wrongdoing in the 
importation of more than 600 israelimade uzi and galil automatic 
rifles 
defense secretary fidel ramos said the imports lacked permits 
from his department customs officials said other regulations were 
broken 
nevertheless after a closed special session the house ruled 
that the two congressmen who brokered the importation did not commit 
any improprieties the house voted however to turn the weapons 
over to the military in response to public opinion 
reps rodrigo gutang and renato unico both retired military 
officers said the guns were to have been paid for by the 
congressmen with their own money they said the legislators needed 
the weapons to defend themselves from rising crime and threats from 
communist rebels 
as the gun controversy raged someone leaked the senates 
decision to buy 35 new cars the public uproar was immediate with 
most comment accusing the senators of callousness in light of 
widespread poverty 
callers to television and radio programs threatened to stone 
senators in their new cars one woman offered cash rewards to people 
who actually did so 
a few senators dropped the idea following the uproar but senate 
president jovito salonga and other senators insist that public 
officials have a right to have official vehicles 
other scandals to hit the house involved pork barrel funds and 
other allowances 
last year house speaker ramon mitra handed an envelope 
containing 20000 pesos 1000 to a member of the congressional 
press corps on the eve of the legislatures christmas recess 
some newspapers immediately assailed the move as an attempt to 
buy off the press mitra said however the money was given in lieu 
of a traditional blowout congress gives reporters after passing 
the national budget 
the money was eventually spent by mitra on a dinner for the 
entire press corps

on a leather strap around the young womans neck 
hung a plumsized chunk of quartz 
it puts a circle of power around you that keeps you feeling 
protected said marybeth stroebel of jersey city n j a graphic 
artist for a manhattan advertising firm 
the crystal shields you she said if you know how to get 
in tune with it it helps you be more safe and calm when you 
encounter some unpleasant situation its electromagnetic you 
know 
such minute energy pervades the known universe including every 
piece of earth but an esoteric view of the new age movement is that 
quartz crystals give off a soothing guarding aura 
this is among an effusion of the movements exotic ideas 
extraterrestrial beings reincarnation outofbody experiences 
rebirthing tanks mantras and channeling wisdom from the 
ancients 
its a hybrid mix says russell chandler author of one of 
the most comprehensive balanced books yet on the movement 
understanding the new age issued by word publishing 
some of its kookier fads may have peaked and be passing he 
said in an interview but the fallout of new age thinking and its 
impact is going to be around for a long time 
many of its subtleties have penetrated the entire culture its 
very attractive and seductive promising quick spirituality its 
eclectic appeal resonates with a lot of people in our pluralistic 
society 
he said the movements key premise in simple terms is that 
everything is god and god is everything and we can become god 
thats the point of all the techniques to attain altered states of 
consciousness 
asked if such playing god wasnt the biblical wrongdoing of adam 
and the tower of babel and of tyrants of history chandler said 
it was its all right there in the opening chapters of genesis 
however he said new agers dont see god in the judeochristian 
sense as a supremely personal sovereign who reveals his truth 
through history but as an impersonal it an energy force that 
penetrates the universe 
god is a sort of loose energy ball rattling around the 
universe chandler said of course you cant derive the ten 
commandments or any ultimate standards from a loose energy ball 
he terms such moral relativism a fault of the movement 
saying its notion of reincarnation puts a different spin on lying 
stealing adultery even murder since victims are assumed coming 
back unhurt in another life 
however chandler emphasized that the movement is varying and 
fluid you sign no creed people buy into it at different 
levels he said espousing only bits or much of it 
it has no coherent organization or headquarters that issues 
pronouncements or any single leadership he said 
but it does have key theoreticians and hardcore strategists 
he said and is promoted in psychic fairs seminars therapies and 
publications its ideas sprinkling tv and movie fare and even 
business motivational training 
shirley maclaine is kind of the high priestess of the 
movement he said noting that her tv appearances and books made 
most people aware of it 
its slogan you create your own reality 
chandler 56 an awardwinning religion writer for the los 
angeles times took an eightmonths leave for researching the 
movement interviewing both its critics and fervent followers 
he says it holds that everything is one vast interconnected 
process that the cosmos is pure energy that all is one 
that individuals can attain higher selves and the world gain 
unified harmony 
humanity is deified death is denied and ignorance not evil 
is the enemy chandler writes of the movement 
he says new agers believe the world nears a profound 
breakthrough when the limited finite old order will give way to 
a glorious unlimited new order of peace prosperity and 
perfection 
thousands of new age activists seek to transform society 
through new age precepts he writes as the year 2000 approaches 
he adds new age millenial expectations will likely crescendo to 
fever pitch 
although seeming new he says the movements core ideas stem from 
2500yearold buddhisms view of higher consciousness or true 
self and 3500yearold hinduisms view of deathrebirth cycles 
toward blissful oneness 
he says the movement reflects other old influences such as 
primitive animisms deifying of nature the ancient heresy of 
gnosticism claiming divine knowing and oldtime seances 
renamed channeling 
its all recycled and dressed up in madison avenue clothes to 
appeal to our age now chandler commented 
he sees some positive elements in the movement its emphasis on 
cooperation on protecting the earth on internationalism and peace 
on rightbrain intuitive thinking on bodily health through 
exercise and good food 
it is neither the hellish conspiracy that fundamentalist 
critics charge nor the utopian bliss its fondest supporters 
imagine chandler writes 
he says the insidious danger of the new age is its view of 
reality as being without absolutes history provides evidence that 
relative standards of morality breed chaos and ultimately the 
downfall of society

janet mondlane educated in a oneroom 
schoolhouse near downers grove ill was 17 and dreaming of 
becoming a doctor in africa when she met an african revolutionary at 
a summer church camp 
he changed her life 
it was 1951 and eduardo mondlane who became the founder and 
first president of the mozambican liberation front was 31 and 
lecturing at church camps as part of his scholarship to oberlin 
college in ohio 
i am a product of eduardo mondlane says his widow 55 who 
heads the red cross in mozambique still wracked by war and famine 
14 years after independence from portugal and 20 years after her 
husbands assassination 
i grew up in this little town near chicago until i was 7 i 
lived out in the country the former janet rae johnson recalled in 
an interview life was calm very stable not many ideas were 
passing through 
she said eduardo was able to write on a blank sheet and he 
wrote on it until the time he died 
on feb 3 1969 mondlane was killed by a parcel bomb at his 
office in dar es salaam tanzania where the revolutionary movement 
known by its portuguese acronym frelimo was headquartered 
during the war against the portuguese 
during the whole long struggle every now and then you had to 
pick up the children and leave the house in the middle of the night 
because word came that someone was coming to attack mrs mondlane 
said 
im not at all a violent person as a matter of fact im rather 
a passivist but my life has been very much linked with war 
unfortunately 
her work as head of the mozambican red cross involves providing 
emergency aid for millions of refugees displaced by fighting between 
the frelimo government which took power in 1975 under a marxist 
constitution and guerrillas of the mozambican national resistance 
supported for many years by the whiteminority governments of south 
africa and what then was rhodesia 
mrs mondlane said she is not a marxist but is a member of the 
frelimo party and a deputy in the peoples assembly the national 
legislature 
todays mozambique is not what she had expected she said 
i never counted on so much war thats for sure we thought 
that it would be possible to develop the country it hasnt been 
a major decision of her life was relinquishing her american 
citizenship 
the rest of my family is in the states its a question of do 
you break these ties or dont you really throw in the lot or not 
i decided yes this is really my country i really dedicated my 
life to this country since i met eduardo and thats a long time ago 
i went to the church camp in geneva wis and there was 
eduardo we students were supposed to go to a different lecture 
every day i went to the lecture monday on africa and stayed there 
i was just mesmerized 
she and mondlane exchanged letters for the next 18 months after 
high school graduation she went to marianhill college in ohio to be 
near him then they both transferred to northwestern university in 
evanston ill 
blacks and whites didnt get married then she said the 
process took five years trying to work through things with my 
family there was a lot of hullabaloo from his missionary friends 
about marrying instead of going to the congo 
mondlane went to work for the united nations and didnt return to 
africa until 1961 
after nine months as a professor at syracuse university in new 
york mondlane went to tanzania where three mozambican exile groups 
united in 1962 under his leadership and began the guerrilla war 
after her husbands death mrs mondlane helped fund schools and 
medical posts in the northern provinces that frelimo controlled 
until independence came in 1975 
what id like to do is go and work on my farm in the 
countryside but here i am still working here doing the same thing 
i was doing all my life said mrs mondlane

for jose and juanita pichardo cuban 
immigrants in their mid60s owning a tiny beachfront room for their 
golden years was the payback for 30 years of hard work and modest 
living in new york city 
hedy werner wanted a retirement free of mortgage payments and 
troubles when she paid nearly 30000 cash for a room on the 12th 
floor of the carillon hotel now she says her money went to 
gangsters 
the dreams of nearly 300 people who say they thought they were 
buying security in the form of rooms at the oncegrand hotel soured 
almost as fast as developer isaac gamel sold 72year subleases on 
rooms in 1983 
rooms were bought for as little as 20000 as an investment 
believed to be secure through 2055 
five years later the 17story 600room hotel on miami beach is 
mired in lawsuits bankruptcies and foreclosures back under control 
of its original property holder main realty and the tenants face 
eviction 
main realty slipped eviction notices under tenants doors in 
november setting a jan 2 deadline tenants on dec 20 sued all the 
principals in the carillon in late december the landlord agreed not 
to take any action until the case is heard in court expected 
sometime late this year 
despite the reprieve many tenants are worried and confused and 
feel deceived many of the elderly residents could lose their 
investments and because they are living on fixed incomes fear 
for their future 
to live here was to live on top of the world pichardo 67 
said wistfully as he walked across the hotels virtually empty pool 
deck 
juanita pichardo recalls when the couple used most of their 
savings to buy a small room overlooking the pool for 27000 the 
hotel was beautiful and everything was working it had entertainment 
at night bingo movies orchestras on the weekend now i realize 
it was too good to be true 
at the height of what usually is a bustling winter season only a 
handful of residents with their own chairs since the hotel removed 
nearly all of the chaise lounges sit around a sedimentfilled 
pool birds splash the water since the pool was shut down by the 
county health department 
the resort whose hotel license hasnt been renewed pending 
further inquiry by the state is a haven for crack cocaine addicts 
the rooftop once used as a luxury health spa is littered and reeks 
of urine 
two fullservice outdoor bars are stripped bare sheets cover 
missing chandeliers in the cavernous art deco lobby and the 
restaurant has long been closed residents complain of a faulty 
phone system unreliable elevators leaky pipes graffiti and 
garbagestrewn stairwells 
street people rove the 1957 whiteandaquatrimmed resort which 
has been cited for multiple code and fire violations 
a lot of older ladies are afraid to come out at night said 
bart steinman who rents a room when they bought the place they 
were promised the world basically theyre living in an abandoned 
building 
jose and juanita pichardo a retired bartender and seamstress 
live on social security of 650 a month and some interest income 
their mortgage payments are 393 a month plus 224 a month for 
maintenance 
its a very bad situation mrs pichardo said really i am 
a good fighter but some days i just get disgusted 
the stressful situation recently landed tenant association 
president lee dulimba in the hospital with a burst ulcer 
these people come in abuse the law 100 percent and get away 
with it said dulimba who has spent the past 2 years fighting to 
improve conditions at the ratandroach infested hotel he says his 
life has been threatened and two bullets from a 44 magnum were put 
through his front door 
joseph ganguzza the tenants attorney says unsophisticated 
investors were taken in a murky real estate venture that never was 
economically viable he and tenants also say the city has taken no 
serious enforcement action despite the building having been written 
up for violations dozens of times 
its a regular stop said senior license inspector janice tye 
city inspectors acknowledge that even though the hotels owners 
have not been in compliance they apparently have not paid fines 
the whole problem stems from changes in ownership that make 
enforcement difficult said fire inspector russell white 
the tenants 5 million lawsuit seeks an injunction against the 
evictions and damages for fraud ganguzza said defendants are main 
realty inc which owned the property originally and holds it again 
carol management corp which leased from them and gamel who had 
purchsed the rights to lease property among other individuals and 
companies associated with the carillon 
main realty says tenants face eviction because of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in back rent and maintenance fees ganguzza 
maintains the tenants have paid all along where that money went is 
part of the dispute 
the problem is not new to south florida but ganguzza said this 
complex case is fairly unusual of course elderly people are more 
vulnerable to these type of schemes he said 
gamels attorney michael a hanzman said his client was 
sympathetic to the problems at the carillon but wasnt to blame 
it appears as though a large majority of the problems are 
the result of actions that were taken by parties who operated the 
hotel after mr gamel sold his interest in the master lease in may 
1987 though operating control was transferred in mid1986 hanzman 
said 
ed quinton iii attorney for main realty had no comment on the 
suit 
meanwhile rumors swirl and the air hangs heavy at the carillon 
as tenants ponder their futures 
i have no money i have nobody no relatives no friends 
nothing said 76yearold ms werner a native of hungary who 
survived the holocaust and the disappearance of her only child only 
to give her money to gangsters 
sheldon and sheila fiedler of westchester ny wont even risk 
renting the two rooms they bought after an elderly woman they had 
rented to successfully sued them in small claims court over poor 
hotel services 
the economic crimes division of the state attorneys office is 
investigating complaints at the carillon but could provide no 
further details dulimba said the state attorneys office indicated 
there was possibly a big case here but he said virtually 
nothing has been done to help tenants 
while some believe the complex case will take a long time to 
resolve and that its unlikely a judge would make an unpopular 
decision to go ahead with evictions others arent as optimistic 
if i could said mrs pichardo id leave in a minute

do this winters mild dry conditions in many parts of the nation 
bode ill for the 1989 growing season is the unusual weather causing

surveyed each region

the fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still 
parched corn belt where its premature to predict another year of 
pain but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will 
bring farmers a harsh spring 
though thousands of acres of midwest farm fields were ravaged by 
the drought of 88 much of the eastern corn belt an area east of 
the mississippi river is in moderately good shape because of 
abundant rain last fall 
weve come a long way from where we were at the end of the 
growing season said norton strommen chief meteorologist for the 
us agriculture department it will be very important to see what 
happens in the next three months filling in holes where it remains 
dry 
experts say westcentral illinois eastern iowa northern 
missouri and southern minnesota have yet to recover from the drought 
the difference in corn belt conditions is reflected in 
precipitation since oct 1 the western section received 74 percent 
of normal precipitation while the eastern corn belt received 119 
percent said peter leavitt executive vice president of the weather 
services corporation in massachusetts 
even with above average rains conditions are so dry itll take 
time for the baked earth to return to rich black prairie soil 
though iowa had normal moisture since august it still had only 
2164 inches of precipitation in 1988 the lowest level since 1910 
said state climatologist harry hillaker 
its going to take six to 12 months of normal rain to get 
things back to the way it should be he said 
dry weather not only affects corn but another major midwest crop 
soybeans which in 1988 were at their lowest production level 
since 1976 154 billion bushels 
beyond crops the unusually warm snowscarce winter has 
disappointed wisconsin snowmobilers postponed some farm equipment 
purchases and led some iowa towns to dig new wells 
still experts say theres no reason to panic now 
its too early to worry about not having a crop said neil 
harl an iowa state university economics professor but its not 
too early to worry about the consequences if you did

its been a hard winter for virginia cochran owner of a 
richmond vt ski area not because of winter weather but because 
of the lack of it 
i thought last year was bad in terms of lack of snow she 
said but compared to this year it was pretty good 
scarcity of snow isnt a worry just to small ski operators 
officials throughout the northeast are keeping a nervous eye on 
halffilled water reservoirs farmers fret about soil moisture 
businesses selling snowmobiles and snowplows are hurting 
this is disastrous said steve kitchen who has sold half the 
usual number of snow tires at his biddeford maine service station 
the winter of 198889 is likely to be remembered as the winter of 
no snow 
this has been the driest january in 104 years said richard 
mamrosh a national weather service meteorologist in burlington vt 
vermonts champlain valley has had 199 inches of snow compared to 
the normal average of 42 inches 
the story is the same from maine as far south as maryland 
generally we have had below normal snowfall said frank 
lucadamo a hydrologist with the weather services northeast river 
forecast center if this continues we could see some problems 
problems are already evident officials in massachusetts new 
york and new jersey have issued warnings about water supplies 
reservoirs that supply some big eastern cities are about 30 percent 
below normal levels 
not only are we well below what we normally are but there is 
no snow upstate and you rely on the melt off of that snowpack in the 
spring said tina casey a spokeswoman for the new york city 
department of environmental protection 
the lack of a snowpack has had a wide range of effects the 
finance authority of maine plans to provide 1 million in emergency 
loans to struggling shopkeepers who cant find buyers for snow 
machines farmers in new hampshire fear the lack of snow cover will 
kill off alfalfa fields 
buffalo nys city boosters are having problems organizing the 
citys annual winter festival we might as well call it

as the drought of 1988 becomes the drought of 89 the nations 
breadbasket is worried about producing half a loaf this year 
last years drought hit hard at the great plains states which 
produce most of the hard red winter wheat the primary grain in 
bread 
lack of moisture this winter in the heartland has agronomists and 
statisticians nervous because another belowaverage crop could 
further deplete americas grain reserves and raise food prices 
planted in the fall winter wheat lies dormant until spring when 
it matures and ripens it is harvested in the summer 
farmers in kansas the countrys no 1 wheatgrowing state and 
nebraska colorado montana and the dakotas all say theyve been 
shortchanged on moisture since 1980 with last years drought the 
worst on record for many of them 
in the past few months rain and snowfall have been sparse and 
spotty eastern montana and north dakota are a little better off 
than the last two years kansas and nebraska are a little worse 
colorado is about even in south dakota which lost 68 percent of 
its wheat crop last year the autumn rains didnt come 
at the end of the year we were about seven inches behind in 
annual precipitation said eldon thiessen deputy statistician for 
the kansas agricultural statistics office the ground was so dry 
this fall the wheat never developed a good root system the soil is 
so loose that if the wind starts to blow the crop will be 
destroyed 
sumner county kan annually produces more wheat than any other 
county in the nation last year its farmers harvested 138 million 
bushels but county extension agent gerald levalley says an 
unusually warm winter lack of snow and rain and the appearance of 
bugs in january all have him worried

brink of another season of drought with a few exceptions 
everybody is dry said wyckoff of genoa colo 
david nielsen of the us department of agricultures research 
station in akron colo said the wheat doesnt look good but we 
could make that up in one or two good snowstorms 
lenis nelson a university of nebraska agronomy professor says 
parts of his state need four to six inches of extra rainfall just to 
break even and recharge the subsoil

winter storms veering to the north have taken the edge off the 
pacific northwests drought but only at the expense of california 
and nevada where forecasters fear a third parched year 
in california two dry months have dashed hopes raised by heavy 
november rains statewide precipitation is 80 percent of normal 
and water runoff into rivers is less than 50 percent of normal said 
bill helms state water resources department spokesman reservoirs 
are at their lowest since 1977 
february and march which usually provide nearly a third of the 
years rain and snow will need 125 percent of normal precipitation 
to make up the shortfall he said 
if runoff remains low water to irrigated farmland may be cut by 
up to 40 percent this summer he said 
the last two years have been critically dry last year we 
survived by drawing deeply into our reserves this year we dont 
have the reserves helms said 
in san francisco where lawns have gone unwatered and fountains 
are dry per order of the water department officials plan to 
continue conservation measures instituted last year 
in northern nevada things are looking pretty bleak said 
state climatologist john james january precipitation was about 20 
percent of normal he said 
last summer nevadas drought cut off water to some irrigated 
fields killed fish in overheated streams and cut into recreation 
business around a lowered lake tahoe 
in utah a cold and dry january has dimmed hopes that were raised 
by a snowy december 
in washington oregon and idaho several northwardtracking 
storms off the pacific ocean have dumped enough snow to make water 
officials breathe easier but they say belowaverage snows in

while other southwest states have had a warmer drier winter than 
normal arizona has had unusual shots of colder air more rain and 
even a mild citrus freeze 
between christmas and the middle of january we had below 
normal temperatures and above normal percipitation and thats 
related to the east coast being warmer and drier said craig 
ellis a national weather service meteorologist in phoenix 
phoenix has had almost double its usual rainfall for january 
but thats still just a little more than an inch temperatures have 
averaged nearnormal but there have been unusual cold snaps because 
of a shift in the jet stream across the country 
the extent of damage from a citrus freeze hasnt been determined 
said bob gronowski a commission on agriculture supervisor the 
overall problem was not disastrous but there was damage he said 
new mexico texas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana have all had 
milder winters 
albuquerque had only 5 percent of its normal rainfall in 
december and january was well below normal in most areas of the 
state meteorologist boyd white said 
a recent survey of mountain snowpack depths however found 
nearnormal levels 
in west texas millions of acres of winter wheat are in terrible 
shape drought expert dan krieg said and the lack of moisture poses 
problems for the summer growing season as well 
we have no subsoil moisture and so were going into the crop 
season with a severe water deficit the top six feet are literally 
air dry said krieg a professor at texas tech university 
the warm dry winter will spawn a dust problem when spring winds 
arrive krieg said 
in oklahoma city december temperatures averaged 4 degrees warmer 
than usual and remained above normal for 20 of the first 25 days of 
january meteorologist bill bunting said 
little rock has seen temperatures about 2 degrees above normal 
new orleans january high temperatures averaged close to 60 degrees

this winter has been unusually warm in the southeast prompting 
fruit trees to bud early and causing fears of damage if a freeze 
comes but rainfall levels throughout the region generally have been 
normal 
our topsoil moisture levels are in the best shape theyve been 
in for years said charles brantner a us department of 
agriculture weather statistician based in tennessee a state hit 
hard by last years drought 
he added our stock ponds have been replenished by the good 
rains we had last fall and things are continuing to look good so 
far this year our pastures are doing well and the winter wheat crop 
is thriving 
however the warmer temperatures averaging between 3 and 8 
degrees above normal since the beginning of winter are beginning to 
worry fruit growers in some areas of the southeast 
growers across the region and especially in georgia and south 
carolina two states that produce much of the nations peach crop 
are keeping a close eye on their trees 
in alabama weve already gotten some reports of early blooms 
said jt duffy barr the usda weather statistician for that 
state the growers are worried that a cold snap will move in and 
kill all those early blooms 
ski resort operators in north carolina say the days there also 
have been warmer than usual but they add that the nights have been 
cold enough to allow them to keep their slopes covered with manmade 
snow 
jb kelly ticketing manager at the beech mountain resort near 
boone nc said sales have held up so far despite the warm weather 
overall climatologists and weather watchers say topsoil moisture 
levels are in good shape in the southeast but that they could use 
more slow soaking rains to replenish the subsoil levels they also 
say planting conditions should be good this spring barring a sudden 
change in the weather

towboat operators are uneasy so are new york stock traders 
german manufacturers and japanese grain importers whose fortunes 
hinge on whether a repeat of the drought will disrupt barge traffic 
on the mississippi river 
everybodys a little apprehensive said jim tuttle a 
hydrologist with the us army corps of engineers who is keeping a 
wary eye on snowpack and water buildup in the upper great plains 
but were much much better prepared if it does happen again 
it will be less traumatic tuttle said 
river forecasters say the next six weeks will be critical to 
spring river levels most worrisome is belownormal snowfall in the 
dakotas iowa and other states in the upper missouri river valley 
things seem ok for now in the upper mississippi ohio and 
tennessee valleys tuttle said 
meanwhile engineers hoping to head off trouble after record low 
water levels last summer are using four dredges to scrape rock 
ledges and shoals out of the channel between st louis and cairo 
ill 
normally we wouldnt have any dredges out now this is the 
first time since the 1930s weve had more than three dredges out at 
this time we want to be ready said clyde wilkes of the corps of 
engineers at st louis 
the 2348mile long mississippi is a natural superhighway into 
the us heartland carrying 400 million tons of goods yearly 
it hauls 57 percent of the nations grain 40 percent of its oil 
products and 20 percent of its coal plus fertilizer cement 
chemicals auto parts and other bulk 
the corps of engineers keeps a 9foot deep 300foot wide channel 
for barges but the drought closed the river in spots for 96 days 
until giant scoops cleared away sediment 
the worst bottlenecks were in late june at memphis tenn and 
the mouth of the ohio river when 130 towboats came to a standstill 
for three days the cargo on their barges could have filled a convoy 
of 18wheelers stretching from new orleans to portland ore 
the lowest water levels since records were first kept in 1872 
were set in memphis and two other spots in july 
losses for the year were estimated from 65 million to 200 
million in a survey by barge operators 
the drought came out faster and more furious than anyone could 
have imagined it was never so low for so long said jeffrey 
smith vice president of the american waterways operators 
it was a very difficult year that could have been a 
catastrophe smith said this year were prepared for the 
worst

for americans jolted by terrorist attacks in 
europe of the middle east the only comfort has been that the danger 
is far away yet in the last six years the fbi has recorded more 
than 80 domestic incidents from bombings to assassinations and 
says dozens of others have been thwarted meanwhile however 
antiterror laws have been refined and a secret surveillance court

traffic droned on the new jersey turnpike 
just as on any other tuesday morning commuters passed through the 
rest area here just as sleepyeyed but something was amiss and if 
robert cieplensky hadnt spotted it someone might be dead now in 
new york perhaps or washington or toronto from the shrapnel of a 
homemade bomb 
cieplensky a new jersey state trooper saw a disheveled young 
man in the rest area parking lot walking in circles looking under 
a car heading one way then another when the man got into a brown 
mazda and pulled out narrowly missing parked cars the trooper 
said he stopped him 
the mazda turned out to contain not just yu kikumura later 
identified as a member of the terrorist japanese red army but also 
electrical fusing devices two clocks precision tools us airline 
timetables maps of new york city and other places a bottle of ten 
high whiskey and 36 100 bills 
a search also found three footlong steel canisters packed with 
gunpowder and lead shot 
kikumura faces sentencing monday in newark following his november 
conviction for transporting the bombs with the knowledge and 
intent that they would be used to kill injure and intimidate 
though no one knows the bombs intended target sources 
speculated it was a meeting of finance ministers in washington or an 
economic summit in toronto or that pinholes in a new york map marked 
the spot kikumuras case and others like it raise a troubling 
question 
are americans who have long felt safe at home becoming more 
vulnerable to terrorists 
the fact that we have been free from terrorist acts to the 
extent we have is in some ways amazing said us attorney george 
terwilliger iii who last year prosecuted three lebanese natives 
stopped just inside the vermontcanada border with makeshift bombs 
federal investigators said they belonged to an organization that 
assassinated lebanons presidentelect bashir gemayel 
are we vulnerable absolutely said frank bolz jr whose 
consulting firm trains other nations police in handling terrorist 
incidents 
this is a democratic country with wideopen borders added 
brian jenkins a terrorism expert at the rand corp think tank in 
santa monica calif its not as though were protected by a high 
wall 
nonetheless jenkins said the united states generally lacks the 
driving forces of homegrown terrorism ideology usually 
americans kill in personal quarrels not for causes and ethnic 
grievances the independence movement in puerto rico is an 
exception 
as for foreign terrorists why attack on american soil when there 
are convenient us targets abroad from embassies to fastfood 
restaurants its easier to cross a street than cross an ocean to 
commit a terrorist attack as neil livingstone author of several 
books on terrorism put it 
still despite safeguards bombers have slipped through 
even though their numbers have not been great the fbi counts 
seven domestic terror incidents in the last year law enforcement 
officials know the potential for destruction and intimidation of 
even a single wellplaced explosive the vermont bombs blew 
2footsquare steel plates the length of a football field when 
agents set them off 
americans best protection authorities say will come from 
continued toughening of antiterror laws and swift justice for those 
caught at least as important is intelligence work 
in bolz words we have to get to know more about the enemy 
we cant wait for the bomb to go off said the fbis 
counterterrorism chief neil gallagher who added agents would use 
whatever resources the judicial system would allow to 
neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs 
civil liberties groups are watching for overzealousness 
something the fbi tacitly acknowledged last year in disciplining 
agents for an undercover probe of the committee in solidarity with 
the people of el salvador 
the fbis counterterrorism effort costs tens of millions of 
dollars annually said gallagher who declined to be more specific 
because the budget is classified 
i always say its been 95 percent blood sweat and toil by 
those agencies involved but weve had a bit of good luck too 
said victoria toensing a former top terrorism policy official at 
the justice department 
she said the tools of antiterrorism have improved 
theres better cooperation among investigators and prosecutors 
the fbi which once balked she said now has the coffee waiting 
for justice department lawyers called to an investigation and laws 
have been toughened extradition agreements have been revised and 
its now a federal crime to attack an american abroad she noted 
these changes have not halted terror altogether in 1986 alone 
the worst recent year for domestic attacks the fbi recorded 24 
incidents and nine preventions 
in 1987 the fbis undercover sale of an inert antitank rocket 
to members of the chicagobased el rukns gang led to conspiracy 
convictions and long prison terms the government said they had 
offered to blow up us targets for libya 
a domestic group was willing to commit a terrorist act in the 
united states the fbi said in order to receive funding from a 
known state sponsor of international terrorism 
in hartford conn members of los macheteros a puerto rican 
separatist group are on trial now charged with conspiracy in a 
violent 7 million armed robbery there and three alleged 
revolutionaries accused of plotting a series of robberies and 
bombings including one that injured 22 are being tried in 
massachusetts 
a 1983 explosion 30 feet from the senate chamber in the us 
capitol was blamed on a group protesting us foreign policy 
security was overhauled senators were warned to remove identifying 
license plates from cars seats in the house chamber got bulletproof 
backings 
before and since groups have detonated explosives at banks at 
government offices under police cars from anticastro 
organizations in miami to affiliates of the aryan nations in idaho 
the tradition of american terrorism goes back to the weather 
underground to the 19th century coalminerterrorist molly 
maguires in pennsylvania and beyond 
in recent years the acts and threats have changed the american 
landscape and lowered americans resistance to searches security 
barriers shield the white house and other public buildings and 
airport scanners having turned up 41000 guns since 1973 are a 
fact of life 
not all of the security gates are closed however according to 
robert kupperman of the center for strategic and international 
studies in washington if you hit some of the key nodes gas 
transmission lines water systems or electric power grids youre 
going to have big trouble

in a 1987 mock attack an army special forces team acting as 
terrorists symbolically knocked out power substations an 
emergency operations center and valves of the strategic petroleum 
reserve in louisiana and texas the us department of energy said 
it was tightening security for the oil stored against an embargo 
it was no mock attack two years ago when a bomb destroyed an 
employees car at the lawrence livermore national laboratory in 
california where nuclear weapons are designed claiming 
responsibility was the nuclear liberation front a group never heard 
of before 
there is no profile to use to spot a potential bomber the 
fbis gallagher said citing the case of raymond levasseur on trial 
now in massachusetts with two others on seditious conspiracy charges 
their group began up in maine as some husbands and wives who 
formed up a leftist terrorist group what identifies them in 
advance as terrorists 
once they began the series of bombings bank robberies he 
said there is a series of trails they left they kept records 
they kept safe houses all that has to be methodically pieced 
together 
sometimes the piecing together is beforehand the decadeold 
foreign intelligence surveillance act court is described as an 
important antiterrorism tool 
the court which convenes in a secret room in the justice 
department headquarters with judges rotated every two weeks hears 
500 applications a year for electronic surveillance in foreign 
intelligence spying and terrorism cases 
we have never been turned down said mary lawton of the 
departments office of intelligence policy and review 
it was a fisa courtapproved wiretap that alerted fbi agents to a 
dynamite bomb aboard a los angelestoboston flight in 1982 three 
men convicted of conspiracy and transporation of explosives 
appealed saying their rights had been violated but the convictions 
were upheld 
kikumuras lawyer ronald kuby is challenging the legality of 
the search that turned up the bombs in new jersey saying the 
government violated his clients rights in pursuit of this 
allegedly higher goal of attacking terrorism 
speaking generally kuby added when a supposed democracy 
violates individual civil rights and goes outside the law in order 
to punish certain individuals that society loses the moral 
authority to criticize and condemn the actions of others such 
inequity leads to more violence he said 
some see an inequity in punishing actions even violent ones 
taken for a political cause last year the greek government 
declined to extradite a suspected terrorist bomber to italy 
explaining that he had been acting in the palestinian struggle for 
independence 
a current case raises the issue again 
in 1982 a bomb went off on a pan am 747 approaching honolulu 
with 285 passengers aboard a 16yearold boy died a palestinian 
indicted in the case mohammed rashid is being held in a greek jail 
for a passport violation and the us government wants him 
extradited for trial here a decision is pending in athens 
ideology is irrelevant when a bomb goes off said bolz the 
security consultant people can be killed no matter what the 
cause

here are excerpts from a recent associated 
press interview with neil gallagher who heads the counterterrorism 
section of the federal bureau of investigation 
ap an alleged member of the japanese red army was arrested in 
new jersey with three bombs last year isnt it unusual for overseas 
terrorists to operate here 
gallagher whether or not thats an aberration i think it drives 
home the message that though the united states has not had the 
degree of incidents that weve seen worldwide certainly the 
potential is always there for a terrorist incident in the united 
states as long as the causes exist that any given terrorist group 
may follow it can happen in the united states 
q that case boiled down to one alert state trooper 
a one state trooper taking outstanding law enforcement action on 
a given day with a traffic stop faced with that type of law 
enforcement scrutiny a terrorist organization would be less apt to 
take an act here the second factor that would tend to minimize 
the number of terrorist activities in the united states is the fact 
that there is a counterterrorism program 
the term terrorist tends to glamorize what otherwise is a 
criminal element any criminal organization theyre going to have 
associates theyre going to have planning theyre going to take 
overt acts certainly to bring weapons in or to bring 
explosives into the united states may be a problem so they may 
have to reach out to some element in the united states to once again 
bring together enough resources to commit a terrorist act and in 
essence what youre doing is putting the pieces of a puzzle 
together 
if there is information received that they are affiliated with a 
middle east or perhaps any other nationally associated terrorist 
group we receive information regarding that theres the first 
piece of the puzzle they may assume that theyre subject to 
us government surveillance 
q if the mideast terrorist abu nidal landed at kennedy airport 
he could assume 
a id probably be there to shake his hand id love to meet him 
especially here in the united states if you look at the 
history of the abu nidal organization and the violence and 
suddenness of their attacks at the vienna and rome airports if we 
were to receive information about their arrival in the united 
states that would receive intense interest in the fbi 
q intense interest 
a we cant wait for the bomb to go off or for other criminal 
action to be taken if we have information which would allow us to 
neutralize a terrorist act before it occurs then certainly well 
take it 
whether its surveillance whether its developing of sources 
or working with the customs service of any other federal 
agency or with the state department to turn down visa applications 
if we know a person is dangerous enough because its nice to watch 
on tv when someones able to get just one carlength away from an 
individual and follow them for an hour show surveillance in real 
life is not as simple 
q in a bomb case in connecticut the animalrights activist 
charged reportedly had no knowledge of bombmaking and 
investigators were quoted as saying terrorists may have helped 
her is there a terrorist infrastructure 
a theres not a terrorist underground per se in the united 
states are there support networks for foreignbased intelligence 
groups yes is there a criminal element to which someone who needed 
to have a bomb or needed to purchase weapons could go obviously 
there is 
q what about civil liberties considerations fbi officials were 
disciplined over the investigation of the committee in support of 
the people of el salvador 
a we have to be extremely careful not to concern ourselves with 
people who just may be saying things which are contrary to the 
safety or security of american society take for example the 
young lady up in connecticut that was apprehended with a bomb 
there are many people who are truly concerned about animal 
rights and the fbi has no interest in these type of people 
however when someone takes a bomb and attempts to destroy either 
property or a life in behest of that cause we would become involved 
because then it becomes terrorism

president bush creates an ethics commission 
attorney general dick thornbugh promises tougher securities fraud 
enforcement the harvard business school adds a required course in 
ethics 
as tales of fraud in chicagos commodities pits and the largest 
securities fraud scandal ever ring out a decade marked by sleaze in 
government and business ethics is being touted as an antidote to 
immorality 
a subject like ethics is always important but becomes 
particularly deserving of emphasis at a time when you seem to have a 
strong streak of greed running through peoples emotions said 
boris yavitz a professor of public policy and business 
responsibility at columbia universitys business school 
in one of his first acts bush appointed a panel to recommend 
ethics reform in government the move indicates bush wants to erase 
the legacy of the reagan administration in which 100 officials were 
accused of unethical behavior 
thornburgh who replaced edwin meese iii himself accused of 
widespread unethical acts said tuesday the government will create 
special task forces and hire more investigators targeting securities 
and commodities fraud 
they want to get credibility back in the financial markets and 
theyre going to enforce all the rules and regulations to give the 
markets back to the public said jack barbanel a futures analyst 
with gruntal amp co 
at the chicago mercantile exchange and the chicago board of 
trade a twoyear federal inquiry has raised allegations that as 
many as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers out 
of millions of dollars 
in new york drexel burnham lambert inc recently agreed to plead 
guilty to six felonies and pay a record 650 million in the 
largestever securities fraud probemichael milken whose pioneering 
work in highyield bonds thrust drexel to the forefront of the 
securities industry is expected to be indicted soon 
financial and government officials predict the latest moral and 
legal transgressions will trigger reforms such as stiffer jail terms 
and fines for whitecollar lawbreakers 
both the sec and the commodity futures trading commission are up 
for federal reauthorization this year and congress is expected to 
be under pressure to give the agencies greater police power 
some changes may be apparent already for example the drexel 
fine was 6 times larger than any previous securities fraud 
settlement 
and on jan 19 the chicago mercantile exchange fined one trader 
a record 625000 and his wife also a trader 125000 for 
prearranging deals both were expelled 
in an attempt to reassure viewers that its brokers are ethical 
investment giant merrill lynch amp co is airing television 
commercials that conclude with the message a tradition of trust 
most wall street brokerage houses now require new employees to 
sign agreements saying they understand company policies on the 
handling of sensitive or confidential information 
since reports of endemic insider trading surfaced in 1986 and led 
to the conviction of speculator ivan boesky brokerage firms have 
moved to frequently emphasize guidelines newly hired college 
graduates are indoctrinated about behavior deemed immoral or illegal 
weve updated computer surveillance of transactions to provide 
faster and more accurate warning signs of trading and brokerage 
actions within the firm said peter roche a spokesman for morgan 
stanley amp co where a 24yearold junior analyst last year was 
prosecuted for insider trading 
the north american securities administrators association which 
represents state securities regulators wants to require that 
brokerage firms tell new clients whether a stockbroker has committed 
any violations 
that would turn up the heat considerably in terms of people in 
the industry knowing that information about them wasnt just going 
to stay in some file or computer chip in washington but is there on 
the table in front of the customer nasaa spokesman scott stapf 
said 
business schools such as harvards which instituted an ethics 
class last fall after receiving a 20 million endowment from former 
securities and exchange commission chairman john shad are teaching 
students that every business decision has social repercussions 
schools are responding to it because businesspeople are 
pressuring them to said david vogel a professor at the 
university of california at berkeleys school of business 
administration the private sector cares very much about this 
ibm chairman john f akers writing in the current issue of a 
massachusetts institute of technology sloan school of management 
publication said ethical instruction is fine but should begin in 
kindergarten 
if an mba candidate doesnt know the difference between honesty 
and crime between lying and telling the truth then business 
school in all probability will not produce a bornagain convert

most business leaders responding to a new survey 
said foreign investment in the united states helps the economy 
creates jobs and increases us productive capacity 
but one in five nonetheless said the current acceleration in 
foreign investment threatens us social and cultural foundations 
the nationwide survey taken last fall and released tuesday by 
the accounting and management consulting firm touche ross amp co 
elicited responses from 519 executives 30 percent of whom are chief 
executives 
business leaders tend to support foreign investment more than the 
general public does according to a recent survey by the japan 
society a usjapanese friendship organization that surveyed 
attitudes toward japanese investment of people in california 
tennessee and michigan 
touche ross cited government statistics that said foreign 
investment in the united states has surpassed 15 trillion 
that figures includes 13 trillion in portfolio investments such 
as government securities bank deposits and corporate stock and 262 
billion in direct investment in manufacturing plants banks and real 
estate 
foreign direct investment alone has more than tripled since 1980 
the firm said 
the executives were asked to describe the effect of foreign 
investment on the us economy and were given three options 
the survey said 55 percent said it helps the us economy 31 
percent said it creates little cause for alarm and 14 percent said 
it severely threatens the economy 
among those who felt it threatens the economy those most 
concerned were from the mountain region while respondents from the 
southeast were much less likely than the overall average to express 
that opinion the survey said 
twentysix percent of those responding from the aerospacedefense 
industry and 21 percent from the retailing business both higher 
than average levels described foreign investment as a severe threat 
to the economy 
touche ross said that suggests those participating in the survey 
from the areospacedefense industries are understandably more 
concerned about the effect on national security than is the average 
respondent 
it said the higherthanaverage response from retailers indicate 
they may feel threatened by the recent barrage of direct foreign 
acquisitions of us retail operations last year the 
canadianbased campeau corps 66 billion buyout of federated 
department stores inc was one of 1988s biggest deals 
but despite the bullish view that respondents overall took toward 
foreign investments effect on the us economy the survey said a 
significant number express concern about the effect it has in other 
areas 
it said 21 percent of those responding said they felt the 
acceleration of foreign investment threatens us social and 
cultural foundations 
among some other key findings in the touche ross survey of 
corporate leaders attitudes 
eightytwo percent of the respondents do not want broad 
protectionist legislation and 82 percent do not think such 
legislation will become law 
political stability was cited most frequently as the main reason 
for the accelerating rate of foreign investment while favorable 
exchange rates were cited second 
eightysix percent of those responding agree that foreign direct 
investment has created jobs for us citizens and onethird said it 
had prevented high rates of unemployment during the past five years 
more than twothirds said foreign direct investment has 
increased the nations productive capacity over the past five years 
more than 80 percent said foreign ownership has either no effect on 
or improves relations with the labor force 
respondents ranked the auto industry as both the industry most 
helped and the industry most hurt by foreign investment ranked 
second among the most helped industries was real estate and second 
among those most hurt was insurance

the chicago board of trade is planning a seminar 
for its members to explain racketeering charges that could be 
leveled as a result of the governments investigation of alleged 
commodities trading fraud 
former us attorney dan k webb will lead the seminar on the 
federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations statute or 
rico karsten mahlmann bot chairman said tuesday 
webb who preceded the current us attorney in chicago anton 
valukas also will prepare a legal document for the bots board of 
directors on the parameters of the rico statute mahlmann said 
the sweeping law originally designed to wipe out organized crime 
by taking the profit out of mob activity has been applied to a 
variety of cases involving whitecollar crime and fraud 
we have requested mr webb to develop this legal memorandum and 
seminar for our membership in order to clarify misunderstandings 
surrounding this statute mahlmann said 
he did not give a specific date but said webbs seminar would 
take place in about two weeks 
no charges have been announced but attorneys for subpoenaed 
traders say the statute could be used prosecuting those targeted in 
the fbi sting operation at the board of trade and the rival chicago 
mercantile exchange 
the federal government is reportedly investigating allegations 
that traders and others systematically cheated investors out of 
millions of dollars through illegal trading practices 
valukas and fbi officials have declined to comment on the 
investigation 
mahlmann told bot members at a special meeting tuesday the 
exchange may reconsider dual trading and explore electronic trading 
two issues that have been hotly debated in light of the 
investigation according to sources who attended the meeting 
dual trading the timehonored right of futures traders to both 
trade for their own accounts and fill customer orders is seen by 
critics as an open door to abuse of the traditional openoutcry 
style of commodities trading 
electronic trading would use computers to match buy and sell 
orders bypassing the 140yearold openoutcry system in which 
traders crowd into recessed pits to execute trades through a 
combination of yelling and hand signals 
the meeting was the first membership meeting to be called since 
the disclosure of the probe jan 19 
the board of trade with about 3400 members is the worlds 
largest futures exchange the chicago mercantile exchange ranks 
second 
federal authorities have issued more than 200 subpoenas to 
traders firms and officials of the board of trade and the chicago 
merc seeking information about suspected fraudulent trading at the 
two exchanges 
the board of trade issued a statement saying only that it had 
presented to its membership a series of proposals that may be part 
of a package of recommendations to be sent to the exchanges board 
of directors on feb 7 
but sources who attended the meeting said mahlmann specifically 
mentioned dual trading as one of the trading practices that will be 
examined by a task force drawn from the board of directors 
and he said the board of trade would be remiss if they did not 
look at electronic trading said a trader who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
i think theyre just waking up to reality and smelling the 
coffee the trader said sooner or later were going to have 
electronic trading 
the chicago merc which hopes to launch its globex electronic 
trading system this summer announced last week it had formed a 
special panel to review its rules and trading practices

after 16 months of fruitless negotiations the 
contract dispute between eastern airlines and its machinists appears 
to be heading toward a 30day deadline and a possible walkout by 
easterns largest union 
on tuesday the financially hurting airline rejected binding 
arbitration nearly as soon as the offer was made by the national 
mediation board 
under the federal boards rule rejection of binding arbitration 
by either side leads to a 30day coolingoff period talks 
continue with mediators but if no settlement is reached the union 
can strike and the company can impose the conditions of its last 
contract offer 
the mediation board was expected to formally declare an impasse 
and start the 30day clock today 
eastern president phil bakes said the deadline pressure could 
lead to a settlement but union leader charles e bryan said the 
company wants a walkout 
theyve been spoiling for a strike said bryan president of 
district 100 of the international association of machinists we 
dont want a strike but it looks like were going to have to 
accommodate them 
bakes said in a statement he was guardedly optimistic a 
settlement could be reached under deadline pressure 
a firm deadline is a very real and urgent incentive for both 
the company and the union to work out differences he said 
company officials said they did not expect a major dropoff in 
advance bookings because of a potential strike 
tom matthews eastern senior vice president for human resources 
and chief negotiator wrote to the mediation board which entered 
the talks one year ago after receiving a jan 31 notice that both 
sides were being offered arbitration matthews turned down the offer 
matthews wrote in a very real sense the stakes for eastern 
are so fundamental so very directly tied to whether eastern can 
survive that the company cannot in such a situation allow a third 
party or an arbitration board to make those decisions 
bryan has long contended that texas air corp easterns parent 
company wants to break easterns unions and sell its assets 
they think they have a good chance of breaking the strike but 
theyve got alternatives and they dont really seem to care the 
attitude is if they destroy the company so what bryan said 
the union leader said tuesday the two sides met in secret talks 
directed by mediation board chairman walter c wallace for five days 
starting jan 18 in savannah ga but made little progress 
the company which was seeking 150 million in wage concessions 
from the union estimates its losing 1 million a day 
the machinists representing mechanics baggage handlers and 
other ground service workers or more than onefourth of easterns 
employees were seeking a 50 million raise the company said 
to soften the impact of the proposed wage cuts eastern said it 
would provide job security and training programs 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988 and has lost more than 1 billion in the past 
decade 
eastern is awaiting completion of a 365 million sale of its 
northeast shuttle service to new york developer donald trump and has 
said it must sell other assets to stay afloat unless it can reduce 
labor costs 
texas air also owns continental airlines a nonunion carrier

polaroid corp has intensified its battle 
against hostile suitor shamrock holdings inc with the filing of a 
suit charging that shamrock broke federal securities laws when it 
solicited proxies from polaroid shareholders 
polaroids suit filed tuesday in us district court in boston 
came one day after shamrock sued the instant photography pioneer to 
block a proposed 11 billion stock buyback 
polaroid charged that shamrock and other participants in the 
hostile bid illegally sought proxy votes because they failed to 
formally notify the securities and exchange commission of their 
plans polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips said 
polaroids suit also charged that shamrock a television and 
radio concern owned by the roy e disney family made false and 
misleading statements in soliciting shareholder proxies 
shamrocks 45ashare offer for polaroid which polaroids 
board has rejected as inadequate values the cambridgebased 
company at 32 billion 
on monday polaroid announced its stock buyback proposal and said 
it was also planning to issue 300 million in convertible preferred 
stock to an investor group corporate partners lp 
analysts said the plans were a defensive move against the 
burbank califbased shamrock which responded by suing polaroid in 
delaware state court polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
shamrock charged in a statement that polaroids directors 
breached their fiduciary duties by issuing additional dilutive 
voting securities to persons friendly to management in the face of 
shamrocks announced intention to wage a proxy contest at polaroids 
upcoming annual meeting 
shamrocks suit asked the court to bar the proposed buyback and 
stock issue 
however polaroid said the sale of the preferred stock to 
corporate partners had already been completed in an affidavit 
polaroid attorney melvin l bedrick said stock certificates were 
delivered monday to corporate partners the transaction was recorded 
and payment was made to polaroid 
late tuesday judge carolyn berger of the delaware court of 
chancery deferred shamrocks request that she stop polaroid from 
selling stock to corporate partners she gave shamrock time to 
determine whether outstanding conditions remained that would mean 
the deal between polaroid and corporate partners was not actually 
completed 
the judge also denied shamrocks request that polaroid be 
required to give five days notice regarding repurchase of its 
common stock 
shamrock spokesman michael sitrick said the company was studying 
the ruling and did not have any comment 
the two sides are already battling in the delaware courts over 
polaroids employee stock ownership plan shamrock is appealing a 
decision that upheld the plan 
if the plan is invalidated shamrock says it will boost its offer 
to 336 billion or 47 per share 
shamrock has indicated it will wage a proxy fight for control of 
polaroids board at the companys annual meeting in may and if 
successful would force the sale of polaroid either under its offer 
or any higher thirdparty bid 
polaroid closed tuesday at 4162 up 1 in new york stock

the involvement of drexel burnham lambert 
inc in the wall street insider trading scandal is costing the firm 
at least temporarily its lucrative business with new jerseys 
casino industry 
officials asked the state casino control commission to suspend 
the investment firm pending a decision on drexels application for a 
license to do business with the atlantic city casinos anthony j 
parrillo director of the new jersey division of gaming enforcement 
said tuesday 
state law prohibits people or companies facing criminal charges 
from doing business with the casinos parrillo said 
because of the huge volume of business drexel conducts with new 
jerseys heavilyregulated gambling industry the state asked drexel 
in 1987 to apply for a license and undergo the required scrutiny 
drexel has earned fees totaling more than 120 million by 
marketing securities valued at more than 3 billion for atlantic 
city casinos in recent years said parrillo the firm itself says it 
has raised more than 25 billion in permanent capital for the 
industry 
drexel agreed dec 21 to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a 
record 650 million in fines and restitution to settle the sweeping 
securities fraud case brought against it by the us justice 
department 
the six charges were filed last week most of them concern 
drexels relationship with ivan f boesky the former takeover 
speculator who turned states evidence in late 1986 after admitting 
to extensive insider stock trading 
while criminal charges are outstanding and the states 
licensing investigation continues any doubt with respect to 
licensees should be resolved before drexel is allowed to continue 
dealing with the casinos parrillo said 
the gaming division is the investigative arm of the state 
attorney generals office that deals with the casino industry 
drexel the nations fifthlargest investment firm issued a 
statement tuesday expressing confidence the matter would be resolved 
soon 
based on steps drexel is taking and new procedures we will be 
instituting both at our own initiative and in coordination with 
various regulatory agencies we believe that we will be able to 
qualify for licensure shortly drexel stated 
drexel spokesman steve anreder said he could not detail those 
steps or how they could resolve the pending criminal charges but he 
said the firm believed those matters could be addressed 
parrillo said the casino control commission had set no hearing 
date to consider the suspension or to resolve drexels bid for a 
license 
drexel has been involved with more than half of new jerseys 
casinos since the state legalized gambling in atlantic city a decade 
ago parrillo said 
according to the states 26page complaint drexel has given 
financial advice and raised capital for the holding companies of 
such casinos as caesars atlantic city the golden nugget and del 
webbs claridge casino hotel 
drexel also has been retained by the company belonging to 
entertainer merv griffin in its acquisition of resorts international 
inc 
one of the six charges filed last week against drexel involve 
golden nugget inc a former atlantic city casino owner drexel 
allegedly committed mail fraud to manipulate mca inc common stock 
during golden nuggets sale of its mca holdings 
golden nugget sold its casino to bally manufacturing corp in 
march 1987 
though drexel was the first the state has since asked three 
other investment companies that do business with the casinos to 
apply for licenses parrillo said they are bear stearns amp co inc 
merrill lynch pierce fenner amp smith inc and oppenheimer amp co 
those applications are pending before the casino control 
commission parrillo said

now its just mr rudolph w giuliani 
today is the first day of the former us attorneys new career 
as an ordinary citizen 
on tuesday giuliani said he planned to spend an extra hour 
playing with my son andrew 3 followed by breakfast with a 
prospective employer 
giuliani kept busy right up to the end of his last day in office 
by attending a washington news conference but only after justice 
department officials vouched for him with wary security guards 
neither giuliani nor his interim successor as manhattans us 
attorney benito romano had their credentials with them when they 
showed up at the justice department 
the new york prosecutors had to wait for other government 
officials to come downstairs and identify them for security guards 
said a chuckling giuliani often called the best known prosecutor in 
the country 
the washington press session was called by attorney general 
richard thornburgh to announce the formation of whitecollar crime 
task forces at us attorney offices around the country 
this is exactly what we need and what weve needed for some 
time said giuliani who suggested the idea about a 
yearandahalf ago 
the southern district of new york which giuliani has headed 
since 1983 will gain six attorneys assigned fulltime to the task 
force 
outside the news conference giuliani who made headlines 
nationwide with his vigorous prosecution on wall street crooks new 
york mobsters and political grafters drew a crowd of reporters 
eager to learn more about his future plans 
as he has done for months giuliani often mentioned as a 
possible republican mayoral candidate spoke much but gave away 
little 
asked whether he had problems with the demands of the politics 
the gladhanding and parades giuliani said with a grin i love 
parades i dont know about all the rest of politics but i love 
parades 
it seems to me a better idea that given the point that i was 
at to put all these things off until the day that im a private 
citizen he said i can feel a lot more comfortable about it 
starting tomorrow and ill be glad to tell you starting tomorrow 
the factors that are involved in deciding what im going to do 
but when a reporter asked how can we reach you where will you 
be tomorrow all he said was pounding the pavement

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge rose a healthy 06 percent in december after having fallen 
during the previous month the commerce department said today 
the december jump in the index of leading economic indicators 
which is designed to predict economic activity six to nine months in 
the future followed a 02 percent decrease in november and a 05 
percent rise in october 
the index has alternated between dips and gains for the past nine 
months which many economists believe is a signal the economy is 
headed for a slowdown in growth that would help keep inflation in 
check 
it tells you that there is not a boom building said samuel 
d kahan chief economist for kleinwort benson government securities 
inc in chicago it suggests maybe somewhat slower growth in the 
next couple of quarters but it most assuredly does not point to any 
kind of a recession 
the economy grew a robust 38 percent in 1988 but the slowest 
quarterly performance in two years was recorded during the 
octoberdecember period when the increase in the gross national 
product was held to an annual rate of 2 percent 
although president bush plans to adopt his predecessors forecast 
that the economy will grow at a 32 percent rate in 1989 many 
private economists believe the reagan administrations predictions 
for growth interest rates and inflation were too optimistic 
six of the nine available components of the economic index 
contributed to decembers increase while two detracted from it 
the biggest boost came from an increase in manufacturers orders 
for consumer goods other business barometers that contributed to 
the increase were rising stock prices more orders for new plants 
and equipment rising prices for raw materials signaling a strong 
demand increased demand for business permits and growth in the 
inflationadjusted money supply 
the indictors that made a negative contribution were a shortening 
in the length of the average work week and an increase in weekly 
unemployment claims 
one indicator the time needed for companies to receive 
deliveries from vendors was unchanged 
decembers increase left the index at 1946 percent of its 1967 
base of 100 that was up 2 percent from the same month a year 
earlier 
in another economic report released today the commerce 
department said construction spending shot up 25 percent in 
december ending a year in which building activity registered its 
weakest showing since the recession year of 1982 
kahan said construction activity rebounded somewhat toward the 
end of the year after interest rate increases early in 1988 
an easing of economic strength without the threat of recession 
would be a welcome development for many economists who believe 
slower growth is needed to keep the economy from overheating and 
causing a flareup in inflation 
economist cynthia latta of data resources inc in lexington 
mass said in advance of todays report that the jagged performance 
of the leading index indicates growth is certainly going to slow 
but it doesnt seem to be predicting any recession at this point 
the fact that its seesawing says that the real risk of the 
economy overheating isnt really there anymore she said on 
the other hand theres no downturn that extends across the 
economy 
michael evans head of a washington consulting firm said before 
the report was released that if inflation stays under control i 
dont see anything else on the horizon that would terminate the 
recovery 
there is some evidence of slowdown in the economy but not very 
much evans said its the socalled soft landing approach 
which appears to be working effectively 
the federal reserve board since march has been pushing up 
interest rates to dampen inflationary pressure and slow economic 
growth 
fed chairman alan greenspan told a congressional committee 
tuesday that he believed the central banks efforts to boost 
interest rates would help prolong the recovery 
as we enter 1989 there are few signs of any significant 
impediments to continued expansion he said 
the traditional precursor to an economic downturn has been three 
consecutive declines in the leading index but while the index has 
correctly predicted all eight recessions since its creation in 1948 
it also falsely forecast four additional recessions 
the commerce department said that starting with the report for 
january it would drop two indicators from the composite index and 
add two others in an attempt to make it more accurately reflect 
future economic trends

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade in a wave of selling that 
puzzled some analysts in light of the strong gains of the previous 
session 
its surprising that were not getting much followthrough 
said jerry gidel a grainmarket analyst in chicago with the gh 
miller division of britishowned lit america inc 
he said much of the selling appeared to be caused by speculators 
collecting profits amassed during the recent advance 
the slow pace of export sales also weighed on grain and soybean 
futures although china was said to have purchased 750000 metric 
tons of us wheat at market prices 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was cent 
to 2 cents lower with march at 273 a bushel oats were cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 222 a bushel soybeans were

stock of textbook publisher houghton mifflin co 
extended its rise today after surging in the previous session 
following the disclosure that a group led by texan robert m bass 
boosted its stake to 56 percent 
the bass group said tuesday in disclosing its holdings that its 
latest purchase was for investment purposes houghton mifflin 
pointed out that bass had been an investor in the company for some 
time and said it found nothing unusual about the filing 
but wall streeters remembered that it was the bass groups bid 
last may that started another publishing giant macmillan inc on 
the path to a takeover at a price about 80 percent higher than its 
stock had been trading 
in new york stock exchange trading today houghton mifflin rose 
another 150 a share to 4675 after tuesdays advance of 887 a 
share at todays midmorning price the companys 14 million shares 
are valued at about 650 million 
the bass disclosure follows two years of sweeping changes in the 
publishing business that has seen macmillan fall to british 
publisher robert maxwell harper amp row publishers inc yield to 
rupert murdochs news corp and grolier inc sell to hachette sa of 
france 
harcourt brace jovanovich inc another publishing giant 
underwent a costly recapitalization in 1987 to avoid being acquired 
by maxwell 
alan kassan who follows publishing companies for shearson lehman 
hutton inc said bass demonstrated his interest in the publishing 
business with his initial macmillan bid and his earlier acquisition 
of bell amp howell co an information services and publishing concern 
based near chicago 
i dont know what his intentions are but he has the interest 
and the deep pockets to acquire the whole thing if he so chose 
kassan said 
bert boksen who follows media companies for raymond james amp 
associates in st petersburg fla said houghton mifflin could 
command a price in the mid50 a share range should a buyout effort 
be made 
a woman answering the telephone at basss offices in fort worth 
texas said it was company policy not to comment on its business 
plans 
bostonbased houghton mifflin is a leading educational publisher 
and also publishes general interest books and educational and 
wordprocessing software 
it ranked fourth in the nation behind harcourt gulf amp westerns 
simon amp schuster and macmillan based on 1987 educational revenue 
according to the trade newsletter educational marketer published by 
knowledge industry publications inc in white plains ny 
shearsons kassan said houghton mifflin has been a wellrun 
company with a fair earnings performance over the past two years 
hougton mifflin earned 241 million or 170 a share on 
revenue of 3683 million in 1988 
nonetheless kassan said the company is vulnerable to a takeover 
because it has a relatively small amount of its stock in the hands 
of company insiders and is clearly a leader in the growing 
lementary school reading market 
in its filing with the securities and exchange commission the 
bass group said it purchased 161200 shares of houghton mifflin 
stock between jan 10 and jan 27 at a prices ranging from 3421 to 
3680 a share 
it said the purchase leaves it with 790200 common shares of 
houghton mifflin or 56 percent of its 14 million shares 
in its statement houghton mifflin said we do not see anything 
unusual in the bass groups filing houghton mifflin has other large 
stockholders most of whom have been investors for a long time 
paul d weaver secretary for the company declined comment when 
asked if the companys board had met to discuss the matter 
the company adopted a poisonpill takeover defense plan in 
december 
last may the bass group proposed to acquire macmillan for 64 a 
share at a time when the companys stock had been trading at about 
50 a share maxwell acquired macmillan last fall at a price of 
9025 a share or about 25 billion

soybean futures prices opened moderately lower 
today on the chicago board of trade amid profittaking and new 
selling linked to an increase in delivery intentions 
corn futures also declined in early trading but wheat was higher 
boosted by the agriculture departments decision to target iraq for 
sales of 1 million metric tons of us wheat at subsidized prices 
the drop in soybean values followed a strong rally late tuesday 
afternoon and partly reflected a weakening of bullish enthusiasm due 
to an increase in the number of notices of intent to deliver 
soybeans against the march contract 
soybean delivery notices totaled 92 million bushels early today 
compared with 44 million bushels on tuesday the first day for 
traders to post such notices 
corn and wheat delivery notices also increased markedly today but 
wheat remained firm on indications of increased export business in 
addition to the usdas offer to iraq the agency has targeted china 
for additional sales of 2 million metric tons of us wheat 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 437 a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with march at 271 a bushel oats were 
cent to 1 cent lower with march at 204 a bushel soybeans were 6

compaq computer corp said wednesday it recorded an 88 percent 
profit increase in the last quarter of 1988 capping a year in which 
the personal computer maker became the first startup company to 
achieve 2 billion in revenue in as little as six years 
just one year earlier houstonbased compaq attained 1 billion 
in revenue faster than any company built from scratch it previously 
ascended to the ranks of the fortune 500 in record time 
strong worldwide sales of our entire product line contributed 
both to the years and to the quarters strong performance rod 
canion the president and chief executive said in a statement 
international sales excluding canada contributed 39 percent of 
compaqs yearly revenue the company said 
compaq founded early in 1982 grew up as a maker of personal 
computers compatible with international business machines corps 
line it reached adulthood in 1987 when ibm switched to its personal 
system2 line and compaq chose to stick with the old standard 
a frontpage headline in a recent issue of info world a trade 
publication said compaq vying to become the ibm of the 90s 
that is somewhat of an overstatement ibm remains nearly 30 times 
the size of compaq and its revenue growth alone last year was twice 
compaqs overall revenue 
still at least in the field of personal computers compaq is 
trying to portray itself as the preserver of industry standards a 
role once held by ibm but ibm remains a formidable rival 
compaqs latest challenge is that ibms new pc line is slowly but 
surely expanding its share of the market while the extension to the 
old ibm standard promoted by compaq and other ibm rivals is still on 
the drawing boards 
canion and his partners began designing their first personal 
computer in february 1982 sales began in 1983 when the year was 
completed they had tallied sales of 1112 million an american 
business record 
compaq reached the fortune 500 in 1985 and achieved its first 
billiondollar year in 1987 
compaq said its earnings in the quarter rose to 919 million or 
218 a share from 49 million or 125 a share a year earlier 
revenue jumped 55 percent to 668 million from 432 million a year 
earlier 
for all of 1988 compaq said its earnings rose 87 percent to 255 
million from 136 million a year earlier earnings per share rose to 
630 from 359 or to 627 from 357 on a fully diluted basis 
that is assuming conversion into common stock of all convertible 
securities revenue rose 69 percent to 207 billion from 122 
billion a year earlier

mci communications corp completed the best year in mcis 
history with a fivefold jump in earnings and a 38 percent revenue 
increase in the last three months of 1988 the longdistance company 
said wednesday 
washingtonbased mci said it achieved the strong results through 
a combination of cost controls new service offerings a good sales 
and service organization and the increasing sophistication of its 
computerized network 
mci spent 6 billion over eight years to build its longdistance 
network and the huge investment is beginning to pay off by 
attracting customers said daniel akerson the chief financial 
officer 
we think it was a great quarter and an unbelievable year 
akerson said in an interview 
mci invading the bigbusiness strongholds of market leader 
american telephone amp telegraph co said it won contracts over the 
past year with chrysler corp cray research inc procter amp gamble 
the social security administration merrill lynch amp co and others 
reflecting the importance of bigbusiness accounts 1 percent of 
mcis and atampts customers account for roughly half of their volume 
of business akerson estimated 
in contrast to mci the no3 longdistance company us sprint 
communications co has continued to lose money but us sprint has 
trimmed its losses lately and is continuing to increase its volume 
of business 
atampt makes steady profits from longdistance but it recorded the 
first annual loss in its history last year because of a onetime 
charge to cover the expense of speeding up its conversion to a 
digital network to meet the competition from mci and us sprint 
mci said it earned 122 million or 46 cents a share compared to 
23 million or 8 cents a share a year earlier revenue rose to 
143 billion from 104 billion 
for all of 1988 mci said its earnings shot up to 346 million 
or 123 a share from 64 million or 22 cents a share a year 
earlier revenue jumped 69 percent to 514 billion from 394 
billion 
charges for early repayment of debt reduced the latest quarters 
earnings by 10 million and the yearearlier quarters earnings by 
14 million mci said offsetting those charges the company 
recorded pretax gains of 12 million in the latest quarter and 19 
million in the yearearlier quarter from previously negotiated 
antitrust settlements

last week yugo america inc its global motors inc and its 
proton america affiliate filed for protection from creditors under 
us bankruptcy law 
proton terminated its distributorship agreement with pai recently 
because the distributor had failed to obtain necessary federal and 
state approvals for importing the saga into the united states by 
nov 18 1988 the national news agency bernama reported 
under a november 1987 agreement pai was to have imported a 
minimum of 30000 cars in the first year and malaysian proton 
officials hoped shipments eventually would rise to 100000 a year 
asked if another company would be appointed distributor for the 
car in the united states jamil replied that proton first would have 
to settle its legal matters with pai 
the regulatory modifications also present an obstacle jamil said 
it took proton 17 months to modify the proton saga to meet british 
regulations 
proton officials had estimated it would cost proton 10 million 
to modify plant facilities to make cars that would meet american 
specifications and another 20 million for advertising 
the proton saga engine and gearbox are made by japans 
mitsubishi but most of its other parts are made in malaysia 
the car comes in 13 and 15liter engine versions and retails 
in malaysia for 9159 to 11723 depending on equipment 
the car has been a pet project of prime minister mahathir mohamad 
and the company has been operating at a loss but jamil said proton 
was expected to report a profit of between 256 million and 293 
million for the year ending march 31 1989 
the plant was established at a cost of more than 120 million 
and first year sales in 1985 amounted to 7494 cars 11 percent of 
all passenger cars sold in malaysia 
last year 42500 proton sagas were sold here accounting for 73 
percent of the malaysian market 
deputy prime minister abdul ghafar baba said tuesday that because 
of increasing demand annual production would be increased in 
october to 110000 cars from the current 56000

the state prosecutors office opened a criminal 
inquiry wednesday into an insider trading scandal involving 
businessmen with close ties to frances socialist government 
the decision came one day after frances stock exchange watchdog 
agency the commission des operations de bourse said it found 
evidence of illegal insider trading in shares of the us company 
triangle industries inc just before its takeover by the french 
stateowned metals manufacturer pechiney sa 
the commission said it could not identify who leaked valuable 
information before the deal was announced and recommended a 
criminal investigation 
edith boizette an investigating magistrate attached to the 
tribunal of paris was named to lead the probe 
the commission said tuesday it found serious precise and 
concordant indications of illegal activity in the trading of 
triangle shares during the few days after pechiney had agreed to an 
offer of 56 per share but before the deal was announced on nov 21 
among the investors who bought triangle stock at around 10 a 
share and made quick profits within a week when the price soared 
was max theret a businessman with longstanding ties to the 
socialist party 
therets investment company made purchases that were suspicious 
the commission said 
also named in the report was rogerpatrice pelat one of 
president francois mitterrands oldest and closest friends 
pelat his wife and two sons bought 10000 shares of triangle 
stock on nov 16 for the equivalent of about 100000 and resold it 
in three installments on nov 22 23 and 28 making about 450000 
in another development wednesday the commission said it opened 
an investigation into suspected trading irregularities in the shares 
of the french bank societe generale 
the investigation will cover trading since june 1 1988 and will 
try to establish if there was insider trading or if there was an 
attempt to manipulate the stock price of the bank 
formerly stateowned societe generale was sold to private 
investors in 1987 under the privatization program of the 
conservative government then in power the socialists contend that 
friends of thenpremier jacques chirac were handed control of the 
bank 
the socialist government in office since last may has denied 
opposition charges that it was behind a takeover attempt on societe 
generale in a covert bid to reestablish state control of the bank 
last month the government was embarrassed when industry minister 
roger fauroux one of the nonsocialist members of cabinet was 
quoted as saying the societe generale affair was much more 
serious than the pechineytriangle case and that the stock 
exchange commission should have investigated it 
even so commission chairman jean ferge said as recently as 
tuesday that no decision to open an inquiry had been made

wheat futures led a selloff wednesday on the 
chicago board of trades grain and soybean markets reversing some 
of the strong gains tallied in the previous session due to supply 
concerns 
the decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an 
agriculture department adjustment that effectively moved the usda 
average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to 423 a bushel a 
level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they 
have been storing as part of the government pricesupport program 
there was quite a bit of selling on the assumption that once 
the trigger level is reached there will be a major selloff said 
katharina zimmer grain market analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york 
but todays slump of course means we are moving further away 
from it she said 
analysts cited profittaking as a reason for steep losses in the 
soybean market where heavy selling late in the session erased more 
than half of tuesdays advance 
at the close wheat was 5 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 431 a bushel corn was cent 
to 3 cents lower with march at 273 a bushel oats were 3 cents 
to 5 cents lower with march at 217 a bushel soybeans were 4 
cents to 9 cents lower with march at 768 a bushel

usx chairman david m roderick wednesday 
predicted that profits during the last year of his leadership will 
surpass the healthy returns posted in 1988 by the streamlined oil 
and steel company 
we just feel extremely confident that 1989 will be a better 
profit year roderick said at his last quarterly news conference 
before his mandatory rtirement may 31 at age 65 thats usually a 
prediction that i avoid making so obviously i have a very high 
level of confidence 
higher prices for crude oil natural gas and steel coupled with 
greater sales volume and lower operating costs companywide will 
enable usx to surpass the 1988 profits it announced tuesday he said 
the company had 1988 net income of 756 million or 262 per 
share more than triple the 219 million or 54 cents per share 
reported for 1987 sales rose from 149 billion to 169 billion 
the 1988 performance was led by a turnaround in steel operations 
which posted operating profits of 501 million compared with 125 
million in 1987 
roderick said he disagrees with predictions of a slump in steel 
late this year 
everybodys anticipating a slowdown in the second half theyve 
been saying that for five consecutive years theyve been wrong five 
consecutive years he said 
the chairman also is more optimistic about steel industry 
shipments than even the companys official prediction of 76 million 
tons 
my own opinion is its going to be closer to 77 or 78 million 
tons because of continued strength in capital spending the gross 
national product and employment he said 
us steel exports should double from about 500000 tons last 
year to a million tons in 1989 roderick said 
in energy operations the companys marathon oil co subsidiary 
should benefit from higher crude oil prices lower exploration costs 
and the renewal of business in libya texas oil amp gas corp unit 
should enjoy higher natural gas prices and greater sales volume he 
said 
as it did in 1988 the company will end 1989 with 1 billion or 
more in excess cash he said 
if president bush fails to keep a campaign promise to renew steel 
import quotas unfair foreign competition could upset expectations 
roderick said 
if anybody has any illusions that these foreign countries 
dont continue to subsidize forget it theyre doing it on a 
massive scale he said in south america if they werent 
subsidized theys all go belly up 
he said the european common market recently permitted the italian 
government to grant 6 billion in subsidies to that nations steel 
industry 
steel shipments by usx will increase from 122 million tons in 
1988 to 13 million tons or more this year he said 
the gains are expected even though 1988 operating profits were 
only around 45 per ton when roderick had predicted 60 per ton 
he blamed the collapse of demand for tubular steel used in oil 
and gas exploration an unintended rise in steelmaking costs 
equipment problems and accounting errors most of those problems 
will disappear in 1989 roderick said 
usx president charles corry elected this week to succeed 
roderick on june 1 said one of the biggest challenges facing him 
concerns the ability of the companys smaller leaner steel 
operation to weather a recession 
we havent tested ourselves in the new configuration yet in a 
down cycle corry said after the news conference i havent made 
up my mind yet whether the steel industry can lose the kind of money 
it lost in 1982 and 83 without companies failing

knightridder inc on wednesday posted an 88 
percent decline in its fourth quarter earnings due partly to a 
onetime charge for costs in the implementation of its joint 
newspaper operating agreement in detroit 
the media company said that in the three months ended dec 31 it 
had a profit of 456 million or 76 cents a share compared with 
50 million or 83 cents a share in the same period a year earlier 
total operating revenue rose to 5746 million in the quarter 
from 5271 million in fourth quarter 1987 
knightridder set aside 13 million for anticipated severance and 
other costs related to the joint operating agreement between its 
detroit free press and gannett co incs detroit news opponents of 
the partial merger asked a federal appeals court wednesday to delay 
the deal 
annual earnings rose to 1564 million or 276 a share 
compared with 1552 million or 265 a share in 1987 operating 
revenue rose to 208 billion from 197 billion the previous year 
robert f singleton knightridders chief financial officer 
said unfavorable factors affecting annual results included a decline 
in newspaper advertising lineage that affected the entire industry 
an average 13 percent rise in newsprint costs and declining 
profitability at its miami herald 
knightridders newspaper division with 30 daily newspapers 
showed an operating profit of 29973 million down 81 percent from 
32619 million in 1987

energy futures prices rose in moderate trading 
wednesday buoyed by technical factors and growing investor 
confidence in opec market watchers said 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled 
48 cents higher at 1751 a barrel after falling 26 cents in the 
previous session other contract months also rose 
among refined products the march contract for unleaded gasoline 
rose 134 cents to close the day at 4963 cents a gallon while 
domestic heating oil increased 104 cents to 5044 cents a gallon 
other contract months also advanced 
analysts said that after a weak start prices rose despite the 
lack of new news to spur prices 
there was no real fundamental change in the market said 
richard redoglia a trader with merrill lynch energy futures the 
market is going through a consolidation phase 
the american petroleum institutes weekly report on oil supplies 
was neutral to bearish for prices traders said the report 
released after the close of trading on tuesday showed crude stocks 
were down slightly while gasoline supplies rose and heating oil was 
mostly unchanged 
analysts said prices got some strength from continued investor 
confidence that opec will follow through on its pledge to lower 
production 
the agreement by the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries which took effect jan 1 and extends for six months set 
a quota of 185 million barrels a day more than 3 million barrels a 
day less than the cartel was producing late last year 
crude oil prices have risen more than 3 a barrel since the new 
quota was announced last november prices had fallen sharply during 
most of 1988 
there was nothing fundamentally new today other than growing 
confidence that opec is serious about what it wanted to do said

the treasury department announced wednesday it 
plans to borrow 2875 billion next week to replenish the 
governments coffers in a giant debt auction which will feature a 
sale of 30year bonds for the first time since last may 
every three months the government holds three debt sales to 
finance the 27 trillion national debt the auction known as a 
quarterly refunding features the sale of threeyear notes 10year 
notes and 30year bonds 
the government however was prevented from offering any 30year 
bonds at the last two quarterly auctions because of a failure by 
congress to raise the ceiling on issuance of longterm debt 
congress finally passed new legislation before it adjourned late 
last year and william bremner treasury deputy assistant secretary 
for finance said the 30year bonds would be a part of next weeks 
auction 
at a briefing for reporters bremner said treasury still expected 
to have enough total borrowing authority to finance the national 
debt at least until next summer 
many in congress expect the government to bump up against the 
current 28 trillion debt limit sometime in august but bremner 
refused to be specific about the month 
all things being equal we expect to make it through without 
difficulty until the summer he said 
the battle over increasing the debt limit is expected by many in 
congress to be a major showdown with the new administration over 
budget priorities since without legislation to boost the borrowing 
authority the government would face the prospect of missing such 
necessary payments as the monthly social security benefits 
the auctions for next week call for 
975 billion in threeyear notes in minimum denominations of 
5000 to be auctioned tuesday 
95 billion in 10year notes in minimum denominations of 1000 
to be auctioned on wednesday

the battle for textile giant west pointpepperell 
inc heated up wednesday as farley inc sweetened its hostile tender 
offer to 153 billion 
farley based in chicago said it would pay 52 per share in cash 
for pepperell stock up from its initial 48pershare or 14 
billion offer on oct 24 the bid which had been set to expire at 
midnight wednesday also was extended until midnight feb 15 
a pepperell spokesman said the company would have no comment on 
the latest offer we have not yet received this proposal and the 
board of directors will consider it in due course he said 
on wall street meanwhile trading in pepperell stock was active 
it closed at 5325 a share wednesday up 250 
pepperell the nations largest publicly traded textile company 
manufactures such products as martex sheets and towels and gold toe 
socks 
farley one of the nations largest privately owned 
conglomerates controls fruit of the loom inc the nations biggest 
underwear manufacturer and acme boot co inc whose brands include 
acme and dingo boots 
in a statement from its chicago headquarters farley said the 
increased bid once again demonstrates our resolve to acquire west 
pointpepperell 
the offer is conditional on receiving or owning outright 
twothirds of the outstanding shares the conglomerate already 
controls 29 million shares and has received offers for another 157 
million which together account for about of 62 percent of pepperell 
stock 
the move is the latest in a series of events that began last 
friday when pepperell which has consistently fought farley said 
it was talking with third parties who might be interested in 
purchasing the west point gabased company 
in a filing with the security and exchange commission pepperell 
said it was not for sale but has entered into preliminary 
negotiations with various third parties who have expressed an 
interest in a transaction involving the company 
pepperell also suggested it might undertake a recapitalization 
which analysts believe would leave the company in the hands of 
current management 
patricia ryan an analyst with raymond james amp associates in st 
petersburg fla said farleys announcement wednesday likely was a 
direct response to pepperells search for a white knight 
pepperell has claimed from the beginning that farleys offer was 
an attempt to purchase the company before its stock could reflect 
last years acquisition of the bulk of competitor jp stevens amp co 
inc giving pepperell about a quarter of the nations home fashion 
textile market 
ms ryan and other analysts estimated pepperells stock is worth 
in the 55 range 
analysts long have expected a higher offer in the pepperell deal 
which also has been caught up in court and legislative battles since 
its inception 
pepperells board voted in november to resist farleys overture 
it went to the extent of holding a footballstyle pep rally at a 
high school stadium in lanett ala where chairman joseph l lanier 
jr told a cheering crowd our determination is to whip farley we 
are going to fight farley until hell freezes over and then we are 
going to fight him on the ice 
after farley won a us district court ruling that some of 
pepperells poison pill antitakeover defenses were not allowed 
by state law a state legislator introduced a bill in georgias 
general assembly that would speed up the effective date of laws 
allowing the provisions 
the bill won approval in the georgias house and currently is 
awaiting action in the senate where a committee has recommended 
approval 
pepperell has appealed the district court ruling to the 11th us 
circuit court of appeals where a decision is pending 
also pending is a ruling from us district judge g ernest 
tidwell on farleys claim that the states antitakeover law is 
unconstitutional 
farleys offer includes conditions that pepperells antitakeover 
defenses be voided

the national mediation board notified moneylosing 
eastern airlines and its militant machinists union wednesday that a 
30day clock is about to start ticking on their stalled contract 
talks 
meanwhile there were signs that some air travelers were 
rethinking their flight plans with a potential strike looming 
eastern airlines formally rejected binding arbitration wednesday 
to resolve the 16month impasse but the union was willing to 
submit board chairman walter wallace announced in a news release 
from washington 
there can be no change in rates of pay rules or working 
conditions or established practices in effect prior to the time the 
dispute arose nor does the union have the right to strike during 
this 30day period said wallace 
the 30day coolingoff period begins thursday and expires at 
midnight march 3 
both sides say salaries are the major remaining issue eastern is 
asking the 8500member machinists union to take 150 million in pay 
cuts but the union wants 50 million in raises 
federal mediator robert cerjan said every effort would be made to 
resolve the dispute during roundtheclock sessions 
meanwhile some travelers were showing signs they are concerned 
about a possible disruption in air service by the miamibased 
carrier eastern was taken over three years ago by texas air corp 
which also owns nonunion continental airlines 
flying through miami on his way home to burlington vt from 
vacation in paraguay eli harvey said a strike would be a major 
problem were already having problems in boston with them wanting 
to raise the tariffs and slow down the smaller traffic to boston 
from burlington so if eastern goes on strike that could be a real 
problem for us 
andrew geller a transportation analyst with provident national 
bank in philadelphia said easterns latest moves could have 
negative repercussions for the airline 
people that have scheduled flights for 30 days from now will at 
least to some degree change their flight plans he said the 
traveling public goes why take the chance 
eastern president phil bakes said in a statement tuesday that he 
is guardedly optimistic a settlement can be reached under 
deadline pressure 
the national mediation board claims a 98 percent success rate at 
avoiding strikes once negotiations reach this stage but talk of an 
eastern strike already has raised discussion of sympathy strikes by 
other carriers 
eastern machinists chief charles bryan who has long charged 
texas air is trying to bust easterns unions and break up the 
carrier believes eastern workers can gain strike support from other 
airline workers 
we have international strengths throughout the world anywhere 
continental or eastern airlines expects to get any help or any 
involvement including transferring of luggage or servicing their 
aircraft by any unionized air carrier throughout the world theyre 
going to be stopped he said 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988 and has lost more than 1 billion in the past

copper futures prices tumbled wednesday following news that a 
labor agreement had averted a strike at a large stateowned chilean 
copper refinery 
on other markets precious metals rebounded grains and soybeans 
fell energy futures rose and livestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper settled 105 cents to 660 cents lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in march at 
1363 a pound 
the selloff was triggered mainly by reports that workers at 
chiles empresa nacional de mineria smelterrefinery had reached a 
settlement with the government eliminating prospects for a strike 
on friday 
the facility refines 200000 metric tons of copper per year or 
about 15 percent of the total production in the worlds leading 
copperproducing country 
thats a lot of copper said craig sloane a metalsmarket 
analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new york if that 
refinery wasnt operational it would be a significant factor in the 
market 
chiles copper production already has been crippled by the jan 
13 shutdown of smelting operations at codelcos chuquicamata mine 
the worlds largest copper mine 
the smelter was shut down after an explosion and is not expected 
to resume operations for another month 
mechanical and labor problems in chile peru and some of africas 
major copperproducing nations have contributed to recent strong 
gains in the copper market the spot price of copper on the 
commodity exchange reached a record 16475 a pound on dec 8 
gold and silver futures prices advanced moderately on the 
commodity exchange after four days of sharp losses that had sent 
prices to their lowest levels since last october 
gold settled 140 to 210 higher with february at 39370 a 
troy ounce silver was 35 cents to 44 cents higher with february 
at 5835 a troy ounce 
wheat futures led a selloff on the chicago board of trades 
grain and soybean markets reversing some of the strong gains 
tallied in the previous session and highlighting supply concerns 
the decline in the wheat market was triggered in part by an 
agriculture department adjustment that effectively moved the usda 
average cash price for wheat 6 cents closer to 423 a bushel a 
level that would free farmers to sell on the open market wheat they 
have been storing as part of the government pricesupport program 
traders sold wheat contracts in anticipation of a major selloff 
if the 423 level is reached and new supplies come onto the market 
analysts cited profittaking as a reason for steep losses in the 
soybean market where heavy selling late in the session erased more 
than half of tuesdays advance 
wheat settled 6 cents to 8 cents lower with march at 431 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with march at 273 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with march at 217 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 9 cents lower with march at 767 
a bushel 
energy futures prices rose in moderate trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange buoyed by technical factors and growing 
investor confidence in opec 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 48 cent to 59 cent 
higher with march at 1751 a barrel heating oil was 104 cents to 
127 cents higher with march at 5044 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 134 cents to 174 cents higher with march at 4963 
cents a gallon 
cattle futures settled mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
with support stemming from fears of weight losses and deaths from 
bitterly cold weather in the great plains and selling linked to 
profittaking after a recent runup in prices 
hog futures prices rose on fears that cold weather in the midwest 
would slow the movement of hogs to market while porkbelly futures 
fell on scattered profittaking 
live cattle settled 12 cent lower to 35 cent higher with 
february at 7507 cents a pound feeder cattle were 10 cent to 28 
cent higher with march at 8475 cents a pound live hogs were 12 
cent to 50 cent higher with february at 4362 cents a pound frozen 
pork bellies were 30 cent lower to 93 cent higher with february at 
3945 cents a pound

texas eastern corp said wednesday it rejected an 
offer to postpone all litigation stemming from coastal corps 26 
billion takeover bid because coastal was demanding an advantage 
over other possible buyers 
coastal officials said they offered not to purchase any texas 
eastern stock before march 15 in exchange coastal sought a 
guarantee it would be treated fairly in the bidding process and that 
texas eastern would erect no new obstacles to a tender offer after 
that date 
we are disappointed that texas eastern refused to agree to 
treat coastal fairly and not to enact any new poison pill coastal 
president james r paul said 
in response texas eastern said the company is perfectly 
willing to include coastal in the bidding process for texas eastern 
on the same basis as other bidders 
however coastal was demanding an advantage over other bidders 
and attempting to limit our ability to properly act in the best 
interest of our shareholders the statement said 
texas easterns board last sunday rejected coastals 42ashare 
offer as inadequate and urged shareholders to wait for a better 
price 
litigation relating to coastals attempted takeover has spread to 
three courts including the us district court in houston where 
coastal sought to block texas eastern from enacting its poison pill 
plan elsewhere

ryder system inc announced wednesday that it will 
buy back up to 15 percent of its stock and is considering selling 
four subsidiaries to refocus on its core transportation businesses 
the move was welcomed on wall street where ryder stock rose 
1125 to close at 28125 on the new york stock exchange 
this is very good news for the stock good news for the 
company said andrew geller a transportation analyst for 
provident national bank in philadelphia 
the planned 2year repurchase of up to 12 million of its 80 
million outstanding shares would cost the transportation and 
insurance company around 324 million based on tuesdays closing 
price of 27 a share 
but miamibased ryder expects to make a net gain of more than 
100 million by selling units that represent less than 5 percent of 
its total assets said m anthony burns ryders chairman president 
and chief executive officer 
we are selling businesses that havent met our financial 
objectives burns said in a statement 
the investment firm morgan stanley amp co has been engaged to 
explore the possible sale of ryders insurance management services 
division which includes managing general insurance agencies in 
florida alabama and texas two reinsurance companies and a 
reinsurance broker 
while the division has been a quality provider of services to 
the insurance market and a good profit contributor it does not have 
an important strategic fit with ryder systems core business and is 
probably more valuable to another company burns said 
the company also is considering the sale of ryder international 
freight and customs services inc a freight forwarding and customs 
brokerage company us packing and shipping co a freight assembly 
and distribution company and ryder freight system a fulltruckload 
common carrier 
we want to put a sharper focus on growing our highway 
transportation and aviation services core businesses burns said 
these other businesses probably have more value and a brighter 
future in the hands of other owners 
the moves continue efforts that started six months ago to reduce 
costs and improve asset utilization ryder said nearly 900 people 
have been laid off out of a total workforce of 43000 the number of 
ryder truck rental district offices has been cut from 105 to 97 and 
the aircraft services division which leases planes has been split 
in two 
burns said no new layoffs are expected 
ryders aircraft leasing business is by far its fastestgrowing 
sector and its vehicle leasing also accounts for a large share of 
revenue geller said 
the other parts of their business are solidly profitable but 
didnt really fit with the rest of these other services he said 
merrill lynch analyst john kalmbach in new york also welcomed the 
ryder moves the end result will be a somewhat smaller company 
with a narrower focus disposing of companies that are not 
individually very large and do not mean that much to the company in 
the long run he said 
the stock buyback to be arranged by salomon brothers inc will 
begin after ryder announces its 1988 financial results later this 
month and will be financed through borrowing burns said

legislation to abolish federal fueleconomy 
standards was introduced wednesday by rep bob carr dmich who 
argued that the rules cause the economy to suffer in michigan and 
the nation 
carrs bill which he first introduced last year would end the 
corporate average fueleconomy regulations that require automakers 
to attain a certain minimum gasoline mileage on average throughout 
their fleets of passenger cars 
cafe is a government regulation that is simply not needed 
said carr the time has come to put it aside without such a 
change the two largest domestic automakers face the unfortunate 
prospect of having to limit or stop selling some of the most popular 
cars in america today 
the fueleconomy standard for 1989 models is 265 miles per 
gallon a slightly more stringent level than the 26 mpg standard in 
effect from 1986 through 1988 but below the 275 mpg set as a goal 
by fuelconservation legislation 
the national highway traffic safety administration is considering 
what standard to set for 1990 models president bushs new 
transportation secretary samuel skinner told a senate committee 
this week he would review any mileage standard set by nhtsa 
carrs bill died last year without action by the house energy and 
commerce committee whose chairman rep john dingell also a 
michigan democrat has said the fueleconomy standards appeared to 
be working fairly well 
dingell has yet to take a position on the new legislation carr 
introduced wednesday the committee staff said 
its an educational process said jeff eller a carr aide 
when asked about prospects for the bill this year we now have a 
base of members who understand why cafe should be abolished 
general motors corp and ford motor co have argued for an end to 
the fueleconomy standards saying it forces them to produce smaller 
cars the buying public doesnt want in order to bring their fleets 
within the mileage requirements 
the result they have said is layoffs at largecar assembly 
plants and a lessened ability of us automakers to compete with 
smallbody imports 
chrysler corp with a higher proportion of smaller vehicles in 
its lineup has said it can meet the 275 mpg standard envisioned by 
the law

the government proposed a ban wednesday on a 
chemical that makes apples appear more appealing and last longer 
citing an inescapable and direct link to cancer that during a 
lifetime could cause five deaths for every 100000 people exposed 
while the environmental protection agency said the cancer risk is 
not high enough to warrant an emergency action to remove the 
chemical from the market it urged its manufacturer to withdraw the 
chemical until a final regulation banning the chemical can be issued 
officials said formal agency action ordering the chemical 
withdrawn will not likely come for another 18 months and then is 
likely to be challenged a process that could take another one year 
to three years 
the object of the epas concern is a growth control chemical 
called daminozide which is sold by the tradename alar the 
chemical is absorbed by the fruit and has been used by apple growers 
since the early 1970s to spur even growth reduce spoilage and help 
preserve apples so they can be sold all year 
alars manufacturter uniroyal chemcial co of middlebury conn 
immediately challenged the epa findings and promised to contest any 
government ban the company said it would not withdraw its product 
voluntarily 
we dont see any basis for taking alar off the market 
uniroyal spokesman yanis bibelnieks said all of the studies that 
have been done since 1985 have supported our position that alar 
poses no signficiant health risk 
he said it was inappropriate to make any judgment based on 
interim results cited by the epa 
bibelnieks said alar production has been reduced by about 75 
percent since 1985 because of the health controversy which began in 
1977 when it was first thought the chemical might cause cancer the 
epa sought to ban the chemical three years ago but held off because 
of disputes about the validity of test data 
the epa and industry estimated that today only about 5 percent of 
the countrys 200 millionbushel apple crop is sprayed with alar 
compared with as much as 35 percent in the early 1980s in recent 
years many processors and some grocery chains have refused to buy 
alartreated apples because of the health concerns 
authorities have said the threat is greatest for young children 
who consume large amounts of apples usually in processed form as 
juice or sauce 
a lawyer for the national research defense council which has 
filed a lawsuit seeking to stop alars use criticized the epa for 
not taking emergency action to ban the product immediately the 
debate ought to occur while the chemical isnt on the market said 
janet hathaway the attorney for the washingtonbased group 
apple growers in washington state meanwhile said they were 
disappointed at the epa position and that they had hoped the agency 
would give alar its stamp of approval 
but charles st john of the washington apple commission said the 
growers likely will voluntarily curtail alars user further we 
know its a great tool for us to use but by the same token if its 
going to hurt our image we dont need it he said 
the epa said wednesday that interim results from new studies on 
test animals show in some cases the development of cancerous tumors 
after exposure to daminozide 
there is an inescapable and direct correlation between exposure 
to udmu a form of daminozide and the development of 
lifethreatening tumors in test mice said john a moore the 
epas acting administrator 
the epa estimated the chances of an adult getting cancer as a 
result of alar exposure from eating apples and apple products at 
five in 100000 but it said the lifetime risk is higher for young 
children because of their greater use of apple products 
the epa said it will begin the formal rulemaking for such a ban 
within 90 days and anticipates issuing a final regulation taking 
alar off the market within 18 months officials acknowledged 
however that the process could take much longer if it is contested 
moore said the agency could seek an emergency suspension that 
would order alar off the market within months but he said the 
agency rejected such an action because of the continuing conflicting 
test data the fact that the tests have not been completed and 
because of the level of risk 
he said that during the 18 months until a final ban is expected 
the risk of an adult getting cancer as a result of alar exposure is 
at most one in 1 million and the risk for a child nine in 1 million 
we dont think that the added burden of risk over the next 18 
months is of sufficient magnitude to warrant this kind of 
emergency action moore told reporters 
derl derr president of the international apple institute which 
represents 90 percent of the countrys apple growers said alar has 
enabled growers to provide the top quality and moderately priced 
apples they desire because it allows apples to remain on trees 
longer keeps them firmer delays internal decay and prolongs shelf 
life

a special committee of the chicago mercantile 
exchange named the president of the futures industrys 
selfregulatory organization to advise the panel in its review of 
trading practices targeted by a sweeping federal fraud investigation 
the ninemember committee appointed robert wilmouth president of 
the chicagobased national futures association to assist in the 
review of trading procedure and policy said merc spokesman andrew 
yemma 
the committee held its first meeting wednesday a closed session 
expected to be the first in a series to discuss trading rules and 
procedures 
separately in washington the staff of the commodity futures 
trading commission recommended approval of the mercs proposed 
globex electronic trading system a key element in the exchanges 
move to set up afterhours global futures trading electronic 
trading also is seen by some as helping police improper activity by 
more closely monitoring deals 
the commission the federal agency that regulates the futures 
industry was expected to vote on the proposal thursday 
also the house agriculture committee designated rep glenn 
english dokla to direct a congressional investigation into 
trading practices in the futures and options markets 
english chairman of the panels subcommittee on conservation 
credit and rural development said the probe would focus on the 
cftcs regulation of the markets and on the selfregulating ability 
of the markets themselves 
the merc established its review panel following disclosure of a 
twoyear undercover federal probe of alleged widespread fraud and 
illegal trading practices in the chicago futures markets 
one practice under increasing scrutiny has been dual trading in 
which traders can buy and sell for themselves and their customers 
simultaneously 
the longtime practice is legal but critics say it invites abuse 
of the traditional openoutcry style of commodities trading in 
which traders use shouts and hand signals to buy and sell futures 
contracts in exchange trading pits 
karsten mahlmann chairman of the chicago board of trade 
indicated at a closed traders meeting tuesday that the exchange may 
reassess dual trading in light of the burgeoning scandal 
and in wednesdays editions the wall street journal reported 
that abs partners widely regarded as the most powerful group of 
brokers at the merc has banned dual trading by its members to avoid 
an appearance of conflict of interest 
none of the abs traders returned telephone requests wednesday 
afternoon for comment on the report 
such a move would be a further indication of how key futures 
market players may be trying to forestall possibly stronger 
government restrictions of their business in the wake of the fraud 
probe 
it also may indicate how dual trading could end up as the 
scapegoat of any attempted inhouse damage control much as 
computerized program trading became the target of voluntary 
restrictions among a number of major wall street firms following the 
october 1987 stock market crash 
broker groups such as abs employ brokers in different exchange 
trading pits where commodities futures contracts are actually 
bought and sold and split losses and profits with their members 
abs partners includes 24 brokers and other members and is 
controlled by maury a kravitz and james j kaulentis two of the 
mercs wealthiest and most powerful brokers the journal reported 
kravitz is a longtime friend and former law partner of leo 
melamed the powerful chairman of the mercs executive committee and 
a key figure in the exchanges growth in financial futures trading 
the newspaper stated 
in endorsing approval of the mercantile exchanges globex system 
the cftc staff recommended that globex trading initialy be limited 
to futures contracts on the australian dollar british pound 
canadian dollar west german mark swiss franc japanese yen 
eurodollar us treasury bills and gold 
globex developed by reuters holding plc is an electronic system 
which beginning this fall would be used before and after regular 
exchange hours 
eventually all of the exchanges contracts would be eligible for 
globex trading

drexel burnham lambert inc reportedly has 
asked nine california members of congress to pressure the securities 
and exchange commission into reducing proposed settlement terms in 
its fraud case 
mayor tom bradley was a key player in the lobbying effort the 
los angeles times reported wednesday by persuading the 
congressional delegation from california to intervene on behalf of 
drexel 
the result was three similarly worded letters from members of 
congress to sec chairman david ruder demanding that the agency 
abandon efforts to force drexel to move its highyield bond 
department from beverly hills to the firms new york headquarters 
the times said 
sen alan cranston dcalif and sen pete wilson rcalif 
each wrote letters on drexels behalf and rep henry waxman dlos 
angeles wrote a third letter signed by six other los angelesarea 
lawmakers the report said 
the six congressmen were identified as reps howard berman mel 
levine david dreier carlos moorhead julian c dixon and augustus 
f hawkins 
at least seven of the nine members of congress have received 
campaign contributions or honorariums from drexel the times said 
drexel representatives asked the three members of congress to 
express objections to an sec demand that the firm move its socalled 
junk bond highyield operation which had been headed by michael 
milken the key target of the federal fraud investigation 
the firm has said that dismantling the junk bond unit would 
severely hurt drexels leading role in the lucrative market for 
these securities commonly used to finance takeovers or finance 
growth of small and mediumsize takeovers 
drexel agreed dec 21 to pay the government 650 million in fines 
and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies to settle 
accusations of securities fraud 
the plea bargain also requires drexel to settle related 
litigation with the sec which filed civil fraud charges against the 
firm last sept 7

occidental petroleum corp agreed wednesday to 
pay the government 205 million including interest to settle 
allegations that a subsidiary violated federal oil and gas price 
control rules in the late 1970s 
the company also reported its financial results which showed that 
a 45 million provision for the settlement deeply eroded 
fourthquarter income 
but for all of last year occidentals profit rose 26 percent 
despite the cost of the settlement and of lost production caused by 
the explosion of an occidental oil and gas platform in the north sea 
that killed 167 
fourthquarter profit declined to 7 million or 2 cents a share 
from 38 million or 17 cents a share a year earlier largely 
because of the provision for the settlement sales in the quarter 
were 53 billion up from 44 billion in the fourth quarter of 
1987 
occidental said it earned 302 million or 121 a share in 
1988 up from 240 million or 106 a share the previous year 
sales for the year were 194 billion up from 171 billion in 1987 
as to the settlement the department of energy originally sought 
700 million from oxy usa inc oxy usa is the former cities service 
which occidental bought in 1982 after the alleged violations
