military spending in the persian gulf visibly 
helped swell the federal budget deficit for the first time in 
october according to a treasury department report 
the government opened the 1991 fiscal year last month with a 
315 billion deficit up 21 percent from 261 billion in the same 
month a year earlier 
military spending at 241 billion rose 49 billion a 26 
percent increase from a year earlier that was somewhat offset 
however by 16 billion in contributions from us allies 
this is the first time that the persian gulf spending is 
really showing up since iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 said 
economist allen sinai of the boston co consulting firm until 
now the military has been supplied mainly out of inventories 
the resolution trust corp charged with cleaning up bankrupt 
sampls also contributed to the deficit increase it spent 107 
billion 36 percent more than in the same month a year ago 
despite the fiveyear 500billion deficitreduction plan 
adopted by congress last month the bush administration has already 
conceded that the 1991 deficit will set a record 
in remarks last week richard darman director of the white 
house office of management and budget said he expected a 1991 
budget gap of 250 billion to 300 billion more if a shooting war 
breaks out with iraq 
red ink in 1990 totaled 2204 billion just short of the 2212 
billion record set in 1986 
the new deficitreduction package does not project a balanced 
budget until 1996 under the grammrudman law as originally 
adopted in 1985 the deficit was to fall to zero in the current 
fiscal year 
many analysts believe the slowing economy eventually will 
depress tax revenues in 1991 in october though individual income 
tax payments mostly withholding from paychecks rose 15 percent to 
407 billion 
the economy is giving appearances of falling into a recession 
but we havent had a collapse in payroll employment yet said 
economist william v sullivan jr of dean witter reynolds a stock 
brokerage firm 
as the economy continues to deteriorate employment will begin 
to contract and that will surely take its toll on tax revenues 
and we will begin to see a wider deficit he said 
government revenues in october totaled 787 billion up 15 
percent from a year earlier while spending amounted to 1102 
billion up 17 percent 
after the military the biggest spending category was social 
security down 2 percent from a year earlier to 194 billion 
interest on the 324 trillion national debt amounted to 181 
billion a 10 percent rise 
programs in the department of health and human services 
excluding social security spent 173 billion up 30 percent this 
includes medicare and medicaid

the debate over president bushs power to send 
american troops into combat in the mideast without congressional 
approval is heating up as international support grows for using 
force to free kuwait 
even as bush proclaimed he is very very close to having 
enough support for a united nations resolution authorizing force 
against iraqi forces in kuwait democratic congressional leaders 
again said they must have a say on whether to send american gis 
into combat 
i think if a decision is made to change that policy to seek 
an offensive military action by the united states against iraq 
then there will have to be prior approval by the congress and i 
believe extensive debate in the congress and in the country 
said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine on friday 
bush has pledged to consult with congress but has indicated he 
might not provide advance notice of any military action or seek 
advance approval 
house speaker thomas foley dwash joined mitchell in urging 
bush to seek congressional approval before committing us forces 
to fighting and said the presidents chances of winning that 
backing would improve if the united nations endorsed the use of 
force 
it would have some significant impact if the united nations 
granted such a resolution foley told reporters 
if the un resolution is adopted then i would hope congress 
would reconvene and take similar action said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas the president ought to have that 
authority and have the congress behind him 
such a course would lessen the chance of an afterthefact fight 
over the right to declare war but there still may be opposition in 
congress to endorsing an attack 
mitchell agreed with foley that a un resolution would give 
bush better odds at winning a congressional endorsement but said 
it would not guarantee one 
it would depend upon the circumstances that exist at the 
time said mitchell 
mitchell in a speech earlier this week acknowledged a 
reasonable basis for argument on both sides over whether the 
constitution requires the president to get congress approval 
before ordering us troops into hostilities 
the debate also has split legal scholars 
the constitutional argument not to put too fine a point on 
it is almost certainly wrong yale law school professor stephen 
l carter said in a recent essay published in the washington post 
there is nothing in the history of the ratification of the 
constitution to suggest that the founders imagined that a 
congressional declaration of war would be needed whenever american 
troops fought an engagement 
taking the opposite view are attorneys at the center for 
constitutional rights which is representing 45 house democrats in 
a suit seeking an injunction prohibiting bush from ordering us 
troops to attack iraqi forces unless congress gave its approval 
if the president takes it upon himself to initiate such a 
war without the unequivocal consent of congress the victim of 
iraqi aggression will be not just kuwait but the constitution of 
the united states the center contended in the lawsuit due for a 
dec 4 hearing

drug addicts trying to scrape up quick 
cash in this struggling mill city are turning to the unusual 
plunder of disposable diapers baby formula and tylenol police 
say 
across the country addicts in los angeles are likely to grab 
car stereos while in miami aluminum awnings and copper wire are 
snagged by those looking for ready money police there said 
the times keep changing on whats the hot items i suppose 
its like the fashion world said holyoke police capt richard c 
page 
reports of disappearing diapers at area pharmacies and 
supermarkets started about six weeks ago said page head of the 
bureau of investigations in holyoke an old factory city of 60000 
people that has fallen on hard times 
weve been noticing a real pattern of it he said we 
started talking to some of the people that we deal with and they 
said thats the thing to take everybody will buy it 
the thefts are not sophisticated page said 
this time of year its so busy you can walk out the door 
with a cart with three or four cases of baby formula if 
challenged they just walk away from the cart or run off page 
said 
the diapers can net a return as high as 50 cents on the dollar 
said page much higher than the usual 10 cents or 15 cents realized 
on stolen goods the goods are sold on the street or to small 
stores that are not choosy about the merchandises origins he 
said 
although some major metropolitan police departments such as new 
york and detroit said they havent noticed trends in thefts by drug 
addicts others had saying the predominant theme is items that are 
hard to trace and easily unloaded 
most people out here what they rip off tend to be car stereos 
to turn a profit for their narcotic trade said officer don 
lawrence a spokesman for the los angeles police department 
police said they noticed the addict thefts became noticeable 
over the past decade 
what were getting is a lot of them are stealing aluminum and 
copper they steal aluminum awnings off the buildings and copper 
wiring said miami police department spokesman bobby navarro 
at first it caught us by surprise and then we were just a little 
bit more looking out for things like that 
in new bedford a once prosperous massachusetts port that has 
seen a decline like holyoke addicts seem to be stealing guns 
mainly from house burglaries said sgt james sylvia 
the stolen guns can easily be sold to dealers for a few bags of 
heroin he said 
theyve got everything from uzis down to the smallest 
sylvia said 
although hardtotrace easy thefts are the usual target there 
are exceptions police said 
weve had people from time to time the news crews who are out 
covering news at particular locations for whatever reason turn 
their back on unloading their camera turn around and the whole 
cameras gone these guys are going for whatever they can get their 
hands on lawrence said

service in the allvolunteer army no longer is 
entirely voluntary 
because of the persian gulf buildup for the first time since 
the draft was abolished in 1973 the army has suspended laws that 
normally allow officers and enlisted members to leave when their 
service obligations are fulfilled 
the army announced friday that the demands of operation desert 
shield have forced it to halt all voluntary retirements and to 
prevent enlisted personnel from leaving 
the move will mean that about 5500 people per month who 
otherwise would have left the service will be forced to stay on 
indefinitely 
the decision was approved by defense secretary dick cheney it 
is an extraordinary move that will upset the plans and expectations 
of many soldiers including those who had lined up civilian jobs in 
anticipation of retiring or who had planned to enter college after 
completing their enlistments 
the army also said it is freezing indefinitely all transfers of 
soldiers from overseas to bases in the united states and is 
cancelling the traditional christmas vacation period for all army 
training centers and military schools 
the cancellation of holiday vacations will affect 22 army 
institutions not including the west point ny military academy 
included are seven basic training posts such as fort jackson sc 
and advanced training centers such as the artillery school at fort 
sill okla the infantry training post at fort benning ga and 
the personnel administration and finance school at fort benjamin 
harrison ind said army spokeswoman capt barbara goodno 
army officials offered those examples of affected installations 
but declined to provide a complete list 
the freeze on transfers will affect between 1000 and 1500 
people per month said an army official who discussed the measures 
on condition he not be identified 
the combination of measures is designed to keep the army at the 
highest possible state of readiness in case additional 
reinforcements are needed in the persian gulf crisis the official 
said it reflects a view among senior military leaders that the 
us commitment to the gulf will be longstanding he said 
ive got an unprecedented deployment underway in saudi 
arabia which required the army to take the extreme step of 
preventing soldiers and officers from leaving the service the 
official said 
about 130000 army personnel are deployed in saudi arabia and 
another 100000 are heading there 
also on friday the marine corps disclosed it invoked a measure 
on nov 8 that means as many as 12000 marines both regular and 
reserve could be prevented from leaving the service even though 
they were due to retire or end their service obligations unlike 
the army the marines will not apply the measure servicewide said 
maj nancy j laluntas a spokeswoman at marine corps headquarters 
the navy has not taken any measures to force sailors to stay in 
the service but it has not ruled out doing so in the future said 
lt beci brenton a navy spokeswoman 
the marines also announced friday activation of another 2377 
reservists for desert shield nearly all will report for duty with 
the 2nd marine expeditionary force at camp lejeune nc to 
reinforce approximately 45000 marines in the gulf 
president bush on aug 22 gave cheney legal authority to retain 
members of the armed forces on duty in the gulf who reach their 
retirement or reenlistment dates but the authority was limited to 
those soldiers and officers directly involved in desert shield 
in taking its action friday the army went a step further and 
applied the authority to everyone in the service 
the army since sept 1 had used the authority on a limited 
basis retaining about 2000 personnel per month who otherwise 
would have retired or not renewed their service contracts 
the army said there will be three exceptions to the mandatory 
extensions of service officers who face mandatory retirement for 
medical or other reasons soldiers discharged for reasons of 
incompetence or other failings and hardship cases

gerow hodges once gave his friend 
multimillionaire ralph waldo beeson a pair of corduroys after 
beeson told him how much he enjoyed them hodges gave him another 
pair 
but as hodges recalled he would not accept them because he 
already had one pair and he said that was enough 
beeson who made his money in insurance practiced frugality all 
his life and spent sparingly 
two or three years ago he gave his yard man about 10 and sent 
him to buy groceries and the man came back with three or four 
dollars in change said thomas corts president of samford 
university in birmingham he asked the man for the rest of the 
change and he said that was all there was well good gracious 
you must have bought enough groceries to last a month 
beeson died oct 15 at age 89 and left more than 80 million to 
schools and to his church 
the bulk goes to samford university to which he had given 144 
million over the years and to asbury theological seminary in 
wilmore ky each gets 388 million 
i never expected a gift of this magnitude said corts whose 
school has 4200 students 
lesser amounts were left to two small colleges in tennessee and 
north carolina and to independent presbyterian church in 
birmingham where beeson annually gave no more than the churchs 
average contribution 
according to the american association of fundraising counsel 
the 388 million was the largest gift to individual schools since 
1986 when the estate of lilliore green rains gave 40 million each 
to stanford university loyolamarymount university california 
institute of technology and pomona college 
beeson and his wife orlean who died in 1987 lived in a 
unpretentious home overlooking samford where a bronze statue of 
the philanthropist sits on a bench near the center of the campus 
the beeson family name is on several buildings 
he had a deep sense of stewardship corts said he didnt 
wear a halo and didnt want to impress anybody with how pious he 
was 
beeson waited until he was 40 to marry he wanted to make 
certain he could appropriately provide fora wife corts said 
they had no children 
beeson was a native of meridian miss where his father john 
wesley beeson was president of old meridian college his fathers 
three brothers also were college presidents 
in 1927 he got in on the ground floor of a fledgling birmingham 
insurance company called the heralds of liberty 
he helped build it into liberty national life insurance co and 
eventually became a director the company was founded by frank 
samford for whom the university is named 
he supported asbury seminary because a former president there 
jc mcpheeters was a graduate of meridian college 
the seminary although independent mainly trains methodists 
samford is baptist and beeson was presbyterian 
he always thought brand names werent as important as what you 
believed corts said 
after serving in the navy in world war ii beeson was asked by 
gen omar bradley to establish a program for veterans insurance 
later he became a consultant training people in insurance 
management 
if he had an extravagance it was boating he belonged to the 
pensacola fla yacht club and the lake guntersville yacht club in 
alabama 
that extravagance didnt extend far 
laverne farmer a friend recalled that beeson recently 
complained to him that the 50cent part needed to repair his 
refrigerator was no longer in stock he said he would have to buy a 
new refrigerator 
i asked him how old the other one was and he said he had 
bought it in 1946 or 1947 but that he sure wasnt going to buy the 
same brand because they dont last long farmer said 
his frugality also came ahead of personal comfort at home 
he wouldnt let you turn on the air conditioning in the 
summer corts said you just sat there and wiped your brow he 
would say it costs a fortune to run that thing

manufacturing japanese cars in the united 
states cost america 36000 jobs in 1988 and 1989 congressional 
auditors say 
the general accounting office of congress said friday that new 
japaneseowned factories in the united states generally are more 
efficient than us automakers and require fewer workers to produce 
the same number of cars 
the gao said some 11000 jobs were lost in 1989 and 25000 the 
previous year 
fewer jobs were lost last year in part because the japanese 
manufacturers bought more parts from us sources the watchdog 
agency said 
the gao report was prepared at the request of sen carl levin 
dmich and rep marcy kaptur dohio 
the gao said it used a complicated formula based on the 
assumption that cars produced in japaneseowned us factories 
displaced both imported japanese cars and cars that otherwise would 
have been sold by general motors ford and chrysler 
its report said japaneseaffiliated factories in america turned 
out 1131000 cars in 1989 and calculated that this provided 
66000 jobs but displaced 77000 other jobs for a net loss of 
11000 
the japanese factories used us sources for 505 percent of 
their parts and components in 1989 compared to 385 percent the 
previous year the gao said 
the gao said the us big three car companies employed 4151 
people per 200000 cars of production compared to only 2613 by 
japaneseaffiliated automakers

roald dahl the british author of macabre 
short stories and lighthearted childrens tales such as charlie 
and the chocolate factory died friday his agent said he was 
74 
dahl died at john radcliffe hospital where he was admitted on 
nov 12 with an undisclosed infection his agent murray pollinger 
said 
dahl wrote nine books of short stories including kiss 
kiss three novels 19 childrens books and numerous screenplays 
and scripts for television last year his total paperback sales in 
britain topped 23 million copies 
his 1964 charlie and the chocolate factory was adapted for 
film as willy wonka and the chocolate factory dahl also wrote 
the screenplays for ian flemings chittychittybangbang and 
flemings james bond thriller you only live twice 
dahl married american actress patricia neal in 1953 and helped 
her recover from a series of strokes in the mid1960s that 
threatened her ability to speak they were divorced in 1983 and he 
married felicity ann crosland 
roald dahls contribution to the childrens book world is 
immeasurable said a spokesman for publishers puffin and penguin 
speaking on condition of anonymity he and his books are held in 
the deepest affection by families all over the world 
dahl said his secret in his childrens tales was that he entered 
a conspiracy with children against adults 
its the path to their affections he said in an interview 
earlier this year with the independent newspaper it may be 
simplistic but it is the way parents and schoolteachers are the 
enemy 
the adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful 
process of civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal 
with no manners no moral sense at all 
dahl was also known for his unnerving short stories 
one critic with the times literary supplement said dahl knows 
how to steer an unwavering course along the hairline where the 
gruesome and the comic meet and mingle 
he thinks of a story as a staircase up which the reader is to 
be lured and finally coaxed into taking that confident last step 
which breathtakingly and deliciously isnt there the critic 
wrote 
reviews of kiss kiss in 1960 saw in his caricature of 
human weakness signs of a social satirist and moralist at work 
behind the entertaining fantast 
he has been compared to angus wilson as well as to saki and 
salvador dali 
i never knew him but i was a great admirer of his said 
theodor geisel or dr seuss in a telephone interview from his 
california home he wrote excellent childrens books and i was 
very interested in his short stories for adults 
dahl provoked controversy in february 1989 when he wrote a 
letter to the times of london describing salman rushdie author of 
the satanic verses as a dangerous opportunist 
two weeks earlier rushdie had gone into hiding under police 
protection because irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini had said rushdie deserved to die for blasphemy 
clearly he rushdie has a profound knowledge of the moslem 
religion and its people and he must have been totally aware of the 
deep and violent feelings his book would stir up among devout 
moslems dahl wrote 
this kind of sensationalism does indeed get an indifferent 
book on the top of the bestseller list but to my mind it is a 
cheap way of doing it 
dahl worked for a number of childrens charities and recently 
donated the manuscript and copyright of his story the vicar of 
nibbleswicke to the british dyslexia institute 
during world war ii he was a royal air force fighter pilot and 
was seriously wounded over the libyan desert he recovered in time 
to fight against pronazi forces in syria 
he began his writing career when the novelist cs forester 
asked him for an account of his raf experiences and the story was 
published in the saturday evening post 
dahl was born sept 13 1916 in wales the son of norwegian 
parents he is survived by one son and three daughters by his 
marriage to ms neal another daughter is deceased

supporters of the proposed two forks dam in 
colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by 
federal environmental officials to kill the project 
if the veto of the dam by the environmental protection agency is 
sustained it could set a precedent for similar projects they 
said 
william h van schooneveld chairman of the metropolitan water 
providers that sponsored the colorado dam said this decision 
affects not just denver but it may be the end of all big water 
projects if epa can veto this there really isnt any project that 
anybody can develop that can pass the epa 
there are a lot of grounds for a federal court appeal he 
said 
conservationists hailed the epa action 
hope babcock general counsel for the national audubon society 
said the era of building these enormous projects is over 
epa announced the veto of the dam friday night confirming 
earlier unofficial reports 
the proposed two forks dam would be the largest nonfederal 
water project in the west it had been supported by reagan 
administration officials 
assistant epa administrator for water lajuana s wilcher 
announced friday she would uphold the recommendation of epas 
denver office to bar construction of the 615foot dam just 
downstream of the confluence of the south platte river and its 
north fork 
the city of denver and 40 suburban water providers sought 
approval to construct a 359billion gallon reservoir southwest of 
denver to meet water needs well into the next century the army 
corps of engineers said in march 1989 it would grant a permit to 
dam the river subject to epa review 
conservationists opposed the project because it called for 
flooding 30 miles of scenic river and ruining 14 miles of topclass 
trout fishing 
denver proposed a smaller 147billion gallon reservoir and a 
package of measures aimed at minimizing harmful environmental 
effects 
the applicants made a goodfaith effort to downscale the 
project size and compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic 
resources wilcher said 
however the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of 
freely flowing scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal 
trout fishery it would inundate an area of unquestionable 
natural beauty that provides a diversity of fishing and 
recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the 
denver metropolitan area 
the armys environmental impact statement in 1988 identified 
several other choices wilcher said epa agreed that less 
environmentally damaging practicable alternatives exist and the 
agency would make every effort to provide timely comment and 
guidance on other alternatives 
big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and big 
farms in the west critics say that too many water resources have 
been diverted threatening the balance of nature

it was apparently late wednesday night 
unseasonably chilly even for november when prime minister margaret 
thatcher faced the cold reality that most of her party wanted her 
to quit 
only hours before she had strode confidently from 10 downing 
street the official residence to say she was intent on beating 
michael heseltine the former defense secretary who had challenged 
her for leadership of the governing conservative party 
i fight on i fight to win she had declared 
according to statements by aides and allies as well as accounts 
in fridays newspapers it was all downhill from there 
the prime minister seemed in good form earlier wednesday in the 
house of commons delivering a report on the european security 
summit in paris then she surprised lawmakers with a rare 
appearance in the commons tearoom to solicit support 
later in her office at the house of commons she met one by one 
with a succession of cabinet ministers and old allies 
most delivered the same brutal message the rankandfile were 
defecting after mrs thatchers failure to dispatch heseltine 
cleanly in the first round of a party leadership vote 
its a funny old world she told some of her messengers 
according to the times and the daily telegraph 
only a few of her staunchest allies encouraged the prime 
minister to push on 
it took just a few hours for mrs thatcher to realize she had 
lost touch with reality that her supporters on the right of the 
party were seeing the world through eyes focused on her earlier 
triumphs wrote philip stephens the respected political writer 
of the financial times 
to thatcher loyalists it looked like a palace coup its rank 
treachery our own people have done it complained tory lawmaker 
edward leigh 
the agony began tuesday evening when mrs thatcher in paris for 
the 34nation security summit learned that she had narrowly failed 
to gain the margin of 56 votes needed to beat heseltine in round 
one that day of the 372 tory lawmakers 204 voted for the prime 
minister 152 for heseltine and 16 abstained 
she responded within minutes 
look i have more than half the votes of the parliamentary 
party it was not quite 15 percent above those of mr heseltine 
so it means we have to go forward for a second ballot she 
told reporters 
she then changed into a formal gown to join other government 
leaders for ballet and dinner at versailles she arrived a few 
minutes late smiling radiantly 
but she was sufficiently rattled to leave the summit early 
returning to london at midday wednesday she sacked her campaign 
manager and began drawing up new battle plans 
she received some welcome advice from staunch allies norman 
tebbit and party chairman kenneth baker according to stephens 
they convinced her that her firstround failure was simply due to 
a lack of lack of organization and commitment and predicted she 
would win on the second ballot when all she needed was an outright 
majority 
but the cabinet reportedly was becoming increasingly mutinous 
john macgregor the leader of the house of commons ascertained 
that 12 of 21 cabinet ministers thought mrs thatcher should 
resign stephens said 
mrs thatcher however reportedly seized on the upbeat report 
from tebbit and baker when tim renton the governments chief 
votecounter in the house of commons told her the rankandfile 
support was collapsing stephens said that she snapped who else 
can beat heseltine 
that evening in those oneonone meetings the times said she 
old one visitor i am coming under an awful lot of pressure 
the final blow according to stephens was delivered by john

rage against margaret thatcher animated some of 
the liveliest corners of british culture in the past decade and 
with her departure many an artist has lost a muse 
there will be a period in which we feel her loss playwright 
peter flannery said friday 
culturally she was an especially clear and pleasurable 
target said novelist and screenwriter hanif kureishi her 
ideology is so clearly obnoxious 
with the labor party split and demoralized for much of mrs 
thatchers conservative tenure the role of opposition fell to the 
chattering classes including harold pinter and his wife 
historian antonia fraser and novelists salman rushdie and ian 
mcewan 
john mortimer author of rumpole of the bailey created the 
amoral grasping politician leslie titmuss as a thatcherite 
character in the novel paradise postponed which became a tv 
miniseries 
mrs thatcher was assaulted in rushdies the satanic verses 
on stage in david hares the secret rapture and in hardhitting 
tv fare such as a very british coup and the grotesque puppets 
of spitting image 
on screen kureishi and director stephen frears achieved 
international renown with a pair of films that let rip against 
thatchers britain my beautiful laundrette and sammy and 
rosie get laid 
the statesubsidized stages of the national theater and the 
royal shakespeare company rang with denunciations of the free 
market ethos of thatcherism 
it was not the best way to catch the attention of the prime 
minister who showed little enthusiasm for culture save for an 
occasional night of opera at the glyndebourne festival her tastes 
in literature ran to jane austen alexander solzhenitsyn and 
frederick forsythe 
mrs thatcher had her friends in the arts including andrew 
lloyd webber and novelistplaywright jeffrey archer who briefly 
was conservative party deputy chairman kingsley amis who became a 
knight thanks to mrs thatcher claimed she had replaced queen 
elizabeth ii in his dreams 
on the left however it was open season 
she didnt kill poetry in 11 years shes not that powerful 
but if she had been there for another 11 years she might have 
said marykay wilmers an editor of the leftleaning london review 
of books 
at the national theater david hare wrote three plays 
pravda with howard brenton the secret rapture and 
racing demon all influenced to varying degrees by the 
thatcher zeitgeist 
the royal shakespeare company had two hits with fashion 
doug lucies biting satire about an ad agency executive named cash 
and singer flannerys sprawling play about postwar britain 
in singer the title character becomes an avaricious 
property developer who lends his name to a phenomenon singerism 
not dissimilar from that recently coined term thatcherism 
what were going to write about now i dont know said 
playwright flannery 
but terry hands artistic director of the royal shakespeare 
company said few writers ever truly came to grips with mrs 
thatcher 
i can remember in the late 80s saying where are the plays 
about these thatcher years as if the whole country was cowed 
hands said in an interview 
he thinks it is too late now to throw any more brickbats 
play writing has either got to be timeless as singer was 
or precisely on the button hands said god defend us from 
plays written about yesterday 
who will be the new target 
former defense minister michael heseltine foreign secretary 
douglas hurd and treasury chief john major are all running to 
succeed mrs thatcher as the conservative party leader and prime 
minister labor party leader neil kinnock also hopes to be prime 
minister before long 
there will be plays about heseltine there will be plays about 
kinnock said peter hall former artistic director of the 
national theater art exists to challenge the status quo

four european nato nations have 
scrapped plans for an attack helicopter following three years of 
bickering over specifications for the aircraft the dutch defense 
ministry said 
britain spain italy and the netherlands began the project to 
develop the european light attack helicopter in 1987 in an effort 
to reduce reliance on americanbuilt weaponry 
but a dutch defense ministry spokesman said friday it was 
economically impossible to meet all the specifications set by the 
four nations a 1989 estimate put the project development at 3 
billion 
the project was also abandoned because of improved relations 
between nato and the warsaw pact said the spokesman who asked not 
to be identified 
the aircraft would have been based on the a192 mongoose assault 
helicopter built by the italian firm augusta

the drug trade is being blamed for a record 
number of homicides in the nations capital this year 
police said the friday stabbing of an unidentified man in an 
apparent robbery attempt brought to 436 the number of homicides in 
the district of columbia breaking last years record of 434 with 
more than four weeks remaining in 1990 
investigators said the latest victim staggered to a nearby 
drugstore for help but later died at howard university hospital 
two other people were found shot to death before dawn friday 
wed like to stop these damned murders said lt reggie 
smith a metropolitan police department spokesman but arrests 
alone are not the only answer the thing is to persuade people not 
to get involved in drugs not to fall to social ills that we have 
seen over the years 
the thing that is driving drug crime in dc is the sale and 
distribution of drugs said richard bennett professor of justice 
at american university police can have very little effect on 
that as long as there is supply and demand 
however the proportion of people arrested testing positive for 
drug use has fallen in the past year and the percentage of 
homicides classified by police as drugrelated as fallen from 66 
percent in 1988 to 39 percent this year

business studies at the university of denver take 
on a rocky mountain flavor as teachers aiming for high ground 
beyond the bottom line are having students trade threepiece suits 
for hiking boots 
lessons in rock climbing and wilderness survival are combined 
with courses in etiquette and cultural sensitivity in the master of 
business administration program designed to boost professional 
ethics and broaden students creativity 
the novel program kicked off this fall with 80 students who 
camped out together in a threeday outdoor course conducted by 
outward bound 
the students arent learning to live with dirt and eat 
berries said tom watkins who headed the committee that first 
explored modifying the private universitys mba curiculum 
the goal in adding the wilderness venture was to build teamwork 
among students and faculty he said exercises that included 
building a raft and navigating it to an assigned spot tested 
students leadership and ethics 
for example did they really paddle to the spot or pretend they 
did 
theyve got the bottom line in their technical skills 
said local cabletelevision magnate bill daniels who helped 
bankroll the program with a 10 million grant what i want to 
teach is how they can get to the top and succeed quicker 
students and faculty returned to the wilderness this month for 
eight days in september they helped build a trail to complete 
required volunteer duty 
a boot camp that will include seminars on professional 
manners negotiating skills and conflict resolution is scheduled 
for december 
backed by daniels grant the university created the institute 
for professional excellence watkins was named its director 
skeptics have said the university of denvers program although 
ambitious may be unrealistic among them was chuck hickman of the 
american assembly of collegiate schools of business the 
accrediting agency for business schools 
is a graduate business school the proper place to teach people 
which fork to use asked hickman referring to the schools 
courses in social skills 
faculty members say the focus is on the big picture like ethics 
questions in the marketplace not table manners 
you see a lot of programs throwing in ethics courses but we 
have tackled it head on watkins said 
daniels said he was surprised when his grandnephew told him that 
he didnt have to take an ethics course while attending harvards 
business school 
i dont know if we can teach ethics and integrity but were 
going to find out he said 
young executives often tend to ignore things like returning 
phone calls getting along with fellow workers looking 
professional and contributing to their communities he said 
professional integrity and corporate leadership are two issues 
brought up in a recent flurry of studies on american business 
education 
a report by the graduate management admissions council which 
represents 300 business schools said business schools must better 
prepare students for a radically changing world one that demands 
more responsibility and understanding of different cultures 
the problems of the 90s are business problems economic 
competitiveness environmental tradeoffs hickman said 
business schools are going to take the lead response to those 
problems

why was santa claus fired 
old st nick says false allegations of lewd advances by one of 
his elves caused the ouster but the manager of the shopping mall 
that dismissed santa said the group wasnt up to standards 
it was the administration of the operation said lawrence 
rose manager of the seneca mall just outside buffalo 
rose this week terminated old style music incs contract to 
provide santa service this holiday season he said the dismissal 
had to do with poor scheduling of santa appearances and santas 
hours of operation 
bernard zolnowsky old style president and head santa claus 
said thats not true 
they were quite happy with our santa clauses zolnowsky said 
friday after he and several employees picketed the mall dressed in 
their costumes the only thing we saw was the problem with the 
elf 
shoppers arriving at the mall friday were greeted at the 
entrance to the parking lot by workers dressed as santa mrs claus 
and elves holding signs that read out of work 
zolnowsky said rose told him last sunday of an alleged encounter 
between an employee at a store in the mall and an elf who was part 
of the santa service 
they said the elf on saturday had made a comment to a store 
employee that he wanted to molest her body said zolnowsky who 
declined to identify the man hired as an elf 
on sunday he told us he wanted the elf terminated 
zolnowsky said they said point blank if you dont fire the 
elf well terminate your contract 
rose said the malls attorneys have told him not to comment on 
any allegations concerning the elf but he said that wasnt the 
reason old styles contract was invalidated 
we terminated the contract on the basis of the general quality 
in the operation of the santa claus operation said rose we 
did not feel this was up to our standards 
rose said the contract between old style and the mall allows 
management to cancel the deal without giving a specific reason 
zolnowsky said when he first heard about the allegation there 
was steam coming out of my ears my first idea was to fire this 
person but he said the elf convinced him that he didnt say 
anything to the woman who complained 
zolnowsky said the mall management refused to provide him with 
any proof of the allegation or an affidavit containing the store 
employees claim

roald dahl a writer whose works for 
children appeared on film as willy wonka and the chocolate 
factory and chittychittybangbang has died he was 74 
dahl died friday at john radcliffe hospital where he was 
admitted on nov 12 with an undisclosed infection his agent murray 
pollinger said 
dahl wrote nine books of short stories including kiss 
kiss three novels 19 childrens books and numerous screenplays 
and scripts for television last year his total paperback sales in 
britain topped 23 million copies 
his 1964 charlie and the chocolate factory was adapted for 
film as willy wonka and the chocolate factory dahl also wrote 
the screenplays for ian flemings chittychittybangbang and 
flemings james bond thriller you only live twice 
dahl married american actress patricia neal in 1953 and helped 
her recover from a series of strokes in the mid1960s that 
threatened her ability to speak they were divorced in 1983 and he 
married felicity ann crosland 
roald dahls contribution to the childrens book world is 
immeasurable said a spokesman for publishers puffin and penguin 
speaking on condition of anonymity he and his books are held in 
the deepest affection by families all over the world 
dahl said his secret in his childrens tales was that he entered 
a conspiracy with children against adults 
its the path to their affections he said in an interview 
earlier this year with the independent newspaper it may be 
simplistic but it is the way parents and schoolteachers are the 
enemy 
the adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful 
process of civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal 
with no manners no moral sense at all 
dahl was also known for his unnerving short stories 
one critic with the times literary supplement said dahl knows 
how to steer an unwavering course along the hairline where the 
gruesome and the comic meet and mingle 
he thinks of a story as a staircase up which the reader is to 
be lured and finally coaxed into taking that confident last step 
which breathtakingly and deliciously isnt there the critic 
wrote 
reviews of kiss kiss in 1960 saw in his caricature of 
human weakness signs of a social satirist and moralist at 
work 
i never knew him but i was a great admirer of his said 
theodor geisel better known as dr seuss in a telephone 
interview from his california home he wrote excellent childrens 
books and i was very interested in his short stories for adults 
dahl provoked controversy in february 1989 when he wrote a 
letter to the times of london describing salman rushdie author of 
the satanic verses as a dangerous opportunist 
two weeks earlier rushdie had gone into hiding under police 
protection because irans spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini had said rushdie deserved to die for blasphemy 
clearly he rushdie has a profound knowledge of the moslem 
religion and its people and he must have been totally aware of the 
deep and violent feelings his book would stir up among devout 
moslems dahl wrote 
this kind of sensationalism does indeed get an indifferent 
book on the top of the bestseller list but to my mind it is a 
cheap way of doing it 
dahl worked for a number of childrens charities and recently 
donated the manuscript and copyright of his story the vicar of 
nibbleswicke to the british dyslexia institute 
dahl was born sept 13 1916 in wales the son of norwegian 
parents 
during world war ii he was a royal air force fighter pilot and 
was seriously wounded over the libyan desert he recovered in time 
to fight against pronazi forces in syria 
he began his writing career when the novelist cs forester 
asked him for an account of his air force experiences and the story 
was published in the saturday evening post 
he is survived by one son and three daughters by his marriage to 
ms neal another daughter is deceased 
funeral arrangements were not immediately announced

iraqi troops from kuwait 
the presidents boeing 747 jet touched down at andrews air force 
base just outside washington dc at 104 est bush immediately 
boarded a helicopter to fly to camp david md for the weekend 
the white house had emphasized that no partial solutions to 
the persian gulf were acceptable and bush said he was very very 
close to rounding up the support he wants for a united nations 
resolution authorizing the use of force 
even without a un vote he said we have the authority to do 
what we have to do to counter iraqs saddam hussein 
nevertheless before leaving for home bush devoted the final 
day of an eightday overseas journey to diplomatic sessions with 
hosni mubarak of egypt his most solid arab ally in the persian 
gulf crisis and with hafez assad of syria his most improbable 
syria is viewed by the united states as a sponsor of terrorism and 
bushs meeting with assad was the first in 13 years between 
presidents of the two nations 
assad sidestepped a question of whether syrian forces would 
fight alongside americans in an offensive operation but the 
statement issued by the white house said the two men agreed the 
iraqi occupation of kuwait is unacceptable and the legitimate 
government of kuwait must be restored fully 
brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser described the 
presidents session with assad as pretty good pretty tough 
asked if his opposition to iraqs occupation meant he would 
support the use of force mubarak said by all means 
a white house statement said bush and assad discussed human 
rights and had an extended conversation of the question of 
terrorism 
it also said bush asked for syria to help win the release of 
american hostages held in beirut among them is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
taken captive in 1985 
in addition the two men discussed the overall middle east peace 
process and the importance of moving ahead with un 
resolutions addressing the palestinian issue the white house 
statement said 
bush made his diplomatic rounds as senate minority leader robert 
dole returning from the middle east said he would urge congress 
to reconvene immediately if the united nations endorsed the 
resolution on force against iraq and that he hoped congress would 
take similar action 
but senate majority leader george mitchell who accompanied 
dole said a yes vote in the united nations would not necessarily 
guarantee one on capitol hill it would depend upon the 
circumstances that exist at the time the maine democrat said 
shortly before bush flew home a soviet official at the united 
nations said the security council would convene next week 
after bush left geneva the white house complained that swiss 
security officers had shoved a machine gun into the stomach of a 
us diplomat and roughed up a photographer traveling with the 
president white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
united states would file a formal protest with the swiss government 
over the incidents which occurred at the base of the steps to air 
force one 
the hastily arranged geneva trip was the final stop on a 
fivenation eightday trip for bush that began in europe where 
east and west joined together to bury the cold war and culminated 
in a thanksgiving dinner with the troops in saudi arabia 
as he concluded his diplomatic mission the army was announcing 
that it would suspend the retirements of thousands of soldiers 
coming to the end of their enlistment periods and would freeze all 
transfers of soldiers overseas to bases back to the united states 
the army said these soldiers may be needed to back up operation 
desert shield in the persian gulf 
bush used much of his time overseas to mount an aggressive 
diplomatic campaign for a united nations resolution authorizing 
force in the persian gulf 
mubarak was unequivocal in his declaration on kuwait 
the iraqi invasion must be reversed and kuwait must be 
liberated the egyptian leader said for both of us its a 
matter of principles and moral courage 
said bush were tired of the status quo and so is the rest of 
the world 
their meeting was a session between longtime allies and mubarak 
has been a key arab partner in the international coalition to force 
iraq out of kuwait 
bushs other diplomatic meeting of the day seemed more awkward 
yet demonstrated the lengths the president is willing to go to 
force iraqs withdrawal 
mr assad is lined up with us with a commitment force bush 
said at the news conference in cairo before travelling to 
switzerland to meet with the syrian leader 
earlier assad told reporters we have the hope there will be 
between us convergent viewpoints 
us cooperation with assad has elicited strong criticism in 
congress and mitchell reflected that dismay in comments to nbc 
news friday night i personally have grave reservations about the 
president and the united states engaging in that kind of a 
relationship with the leader of a government that has been 
identified by the administration itself and our government as 
terrorist 
at a joint news conference bush and mubarak both made it clear 
that they intend to work to win the approval of the united nations 
security council of a resolution authorizing force against 
we havent given up on the peaceful solution at all we have 
been very very patient weve gone to the united nations for 10 
separate resolutions and indeed there will be another resolution 
bush said 
but he added i do feel we have the authority to do what we 
have to do but we have tried very hard to work within the un 
confines of the security council and i have confidence that we 
will be successful in the security council 
for his part mubarak said syria was one of the key countries 
and we should not neglect it 
i dont know if he felt left out but hes an important 
coalition partner bush added referring to assad 
mubarak in opening remarks at a news conference stressed the 
importance of resolving the palestinian issue bush reiterated the 
us position offering to be a catalyst for peace but insisting 
that the dispute be resolved apart from the persian gulf showdown 
in particular bush said i want to see a solution to the 
question of the west bank which israel seized from jordan in the 
1967 war 
bush said the meeting with assad does not represent a turning 
point in relations with damascus weve still got big 
differences with syria bush said 
the presidents diplomatic drive received a setback on thursday 
when secretary of state james a baker iii was frustrated in 
efforts to get backing from yemen the only arab nation on the 
15member un security council 
yemens president gen ali abdullah saleh criticized the 
military buildup in the region and called for an arab solution to 
the crisis yet a state department official said they didnt 
say no to a new un measure 
wed like to get yemen on board bush said anew friday

fight alongside americans in an offensive operation 
bush also met in cairo with egyptian president hosni mubarak

presidential party white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
called it brutal and vicious treatment

ambassador joseph reed the us chief of protocol another 
security agent verbally abused john sununu the presidents chief 
of staff fitzwater said

nation gave us the most vicious treatment ive ever seen

shoved and punched fitzwater said the president witnessed some of 
the unpleasantness fitzwater said he didnt know what provoked it 
the stop in geneva was the last leg of a trip to egypt saudi 
arabia paris germany and czechoslovakia the persian gulf crisis 
was the overriding topic of the trip 
bush said he was very close to getting united nations approval 
for using force to oust iraq from kuwait but that even without it 
we have the authority to do what we have to do

middle east with other congressional leaders said he would urge 
congress to reconvene immediately if the united nations endorsed

been very very patient weve gone to the united nations for 10 
separate resolutions and indeed there will be another resolution

meet with assad and he defended his decision to appear with a 
leader who is criticized by the united states as a sponsor of 
terrorism and an oppressor of human rights 
theyre on the front line standing up against aggression 
bush said he said he would work with countries that can enhance 
the prospect of driving iraq from kuwait

to someone they love this holiday season 
in what has become an annual ritual demonstrators marched on 
highfashion shopping spots from new yorks fifth avenue to san 
franciscos union square as part of fur free friday protests 
most demonstrations were peaceful although six people were 
arrested for blocking the entrances to a neiman marcus department 
store in san francisco among the protesters was rock singer grace 
slick whose request to be arrested was rejected 
the demonstrations come at a bad time for the fur industry the 
christmas shopping season is expected to be sluggish at best 
dampened by a faltering economy that many merchants fear will keep 
buyers from spending on lavish gifts like mink coats 
but mark kirkland spokesman for the washington dcbased fur 
information council of america said the protests had little or no 
impact on shoppers friday 
a light rain held down the size of the largest march in new 
york where police said 1400 people gathered there were more than 
2000 last year 
led by a costumed grim reaper slowly banging a drum two 
marchers clad in skeleton costumes wheeled a cart crammed with furs 
in what a placard called a free burial for those who would 
donate your dead 
get a feel for fur slam your fingers in a car door mocked 
another poster protesters complain that the animals used to 
manufacture the luxury garmets are inhumanely killed 
in san francisco police said six people were charged with 
misdemeanors for blocking entrances to the neiman marcus store 
ill go slick said as the demonstrators were taken to a 
police van parked near the stores northwest entrance 
no police lt daniel hallisy told the former lead singer 
for the jefferson airplane were not going to take you 
in a protest that was largely symbolic 16 people in manchester 
nh demonstrated outside a busy shopping center that has no 
furrier

nc while about 15 gathered in front of furs by monta in 
charlotte nc 
in downtown harrisburg pa a costumed grim reaper led about 40 
people in front of the strawberry square shopping center 
the protesters say their actions have hurt fur sales adding 
that such stores as seattlebased nordstrom and harrods of london 
have decided to disband their fur boutiques 
industry officials deny the protests have hurt saying sales 
were up 10 percent last year 
ken durrant vice president of the fur farm animal welfare 
coalition said the animals are not inhumanely killed he said the 
coalitions guidelines require that its members kill animals 
painlessly with bottled carbonmonoxide gas

a rare strain of the aids virus could get into 
the nations blood supply but the us centers for disease control 
says its too rare to spend money trying to detect it 
only 18 known cases of the strain known as human 
immunodeficiency virus type 2 hiv2 exist in the united states 
tests for the more common aids virus hiv1 usually detect the 
rarer strain predominantly found in west africa 
a study of more than 25000 blood samples detected no blood 
donors with hiv2 infection the cdc concluded that adding hiv2 
tests to routine blood donor screening wouldnt be worth the cost

the national museum says you may 
touch the artifacts in a coming exhibition but its not for the 
faintatheart 
the display will include human skulls deformed craniums and 
shrunken heads from around the world 
mexican cake in the shape of human skulls headhunting weapons 
and hollywood posters with macabre titles like brain eater 
headhunter scalp hunters and skulduggery are also 
among the items 
the show dubbd heads and skulls in human culture and 
history took a year to prepare underwritten by a local company 
it begins jan 16 and lasts for a year 
shahrum bin yub the directorgeneral of the governments 
museums division says the aim of the show is to educate inform 
and dispel superstition by showing headhunting as it was practiced 
in many parts of the world as late as the early part of this 
century 
shahrum says he made two world tours collecting artifacts from 
museums and universities for the exhibition he said he brought 
back about 100 skulls 
he has just returned from mexico where he attended the sixday 
celebration of the dead he saw children eating little cakes shaped 
as skulls so he brought some back for display 
shahrum says the exhibition will include skulls weapons used in 
headhunting costumes and shields 
he said that in some societies headhunting was viewed as an 
initiation rite a young man seeking to marry or pass into manhood 
had to bring back a head usually of his enemy 
some of the skulls contain holes made with primitive tools 
shahrum explained that people in certain societies believed that 
headaches were caused by evil spirits so holes were made in the 
skulls to free the spirits the cure was no doubt more painful than 
the headache 
an example comes from africa in 1957 an expedition encountered 
a living example of the skullboring practice known as trephination 
a man from the tibu tribe he had two huge scars in his scalp and 
carried in his pocket two fragments of his own skull 
among the prize exhibits is the wellpreserved skull of a 
chinese jimmy ah sue who was hanged in australia in 1880 his 
skull borrowed from an australian museum survived long after he 
was gone because a russian scientist wanted to study his brain 
during the exhibition there will be a demonstration of 
phrenology the analysis of character by studying the shape of the 
skull the exhibition will also focus on how skulls are used in 
primitive art 
shahrum is preparing a 400page booklet on the customs and 
practices of people who headhunted 
for instance headhunters in assam in northeastern india 
believed that the head possessed potent magical powers and that the 
human soul resided there thus possessing someones head meant 
owning his soul and controlling his power 
shahrum is no stranger to the dark side of the archival life 
his current treasures from the grave exhibition has attracted about 
700000 people including many foreign tourists a prize exhibit is 
an egyptian mummy borrowed from a british museum

a roman catholic archbishop denied an honorary 
doctorate degree because he surveyed women on their reasons for 
seeking abortions says vatican pressure wont keep him from 
speaking out 
i cant imagine being stopped unless you take out my 
tongue archbishop rembert weakland said friday i must admit i 
may be too upbeat about it maybe thats not good 
weakland said he respects the churchs opposition to abortion 
but thinks church leaders should examine the reasons why catholic 
women are willing to seek abortions anyway 
switzerlands university of fribourg had planned to award 
weakland an honorary doctorate this week but canceled the ceremony 
after pressure from the vaticans congregation of education 
in the letter to fribourg vatican officials accused weakland of 
causing confusion among the faithful concerning abortion 
weakland held six hearings this year for women in the milwaukee 
archdiocese then issued a letter criticizing tactics of some 
antiabortion protesters as demeaning and lacking compassion 
the letter also said people who call themselves prochoice 
should not necessarily be considered proabortion 
weakland said he considered the vaticans actions confusing and 
has written a letter asking for clarification 
everybodys shrugging their shoulders wondering whats going 
on he said 
he added that he knows church leaders have warned that his views 
are not without theological implications 
it wont change my procedure im sure in dealing with any 
topic he said im not concerned about that 
weakland was to be one of of several honorary degree recipients 
at the ceremonies this week he was to be honored for authoring a 
1986 us bishops letter on the economy and social justice the 
university canceled the awards ceremony rather than exclude him

an intensifying gang war in southern japan has 
killed two undercover policemen and wounded a passerby officials 
said today 
the two officers shot friday were found in a car parked 
outside a golf center in a quiet residential area on the outskirts 
of naha on the island of okinawa 
the two policemen who had been investigating a 3monthold war 
between two rival criminal gangs were shot in the head and died 
almost instantly a police official said on condition of anonymity 
during the gunbattle masako sawada 49 was injured in her left 
leg by bullets that ripped through her car as she and her husband 
drove through the quiet neighborhood 
police said the national police agency is sending its chief 
investigator to the area to look into the murders the kyodo news 
service reported that okinawa police have set up a 700member squad 
to investigate the murders 
police quoted witnesses as saying that two men who appeared to 
be members of the yakuza japans underworld gangs approached the 
policemens parked car and fired their guns at close range they 
shot at mrs sawadas car while fleeing in another car 
it was not immediately known if the suspected gang members meant 
to kill the officers or if they thought they were members of the 
rival gang

in the first incident of its 
kind in the 11yearold civil war the government says leftist 
rebels shot down one of its war jets with a missile 
the downing friday which killed the pilot and wounded another 
crewman came three days after the rebels launched an offensive 
that has killed nearly 100 people 
the rebels say their offensive was aimed at forcing the rightist 
government of president alfredo cristiani back to the bargaining 
table after a series of stalemated sessions 
a government communique on friday claimed that rebel use of 
missiles in several attacks demonstrates that the rebels past 
participation in peace talks is purely tactical 
the fighterbomber was shot down in eastern usulatan province 
the communique said it said the a47 dragonfly was struck by a 
sovietdesigned missile at midday near santa elena about 80 miles 
east of san salvador 
earlier the armed forces press office had said the plane 
crashed because of mechanical failure 
it was the first time the government has said one of its 
warplanes was downed by a missile in el salvadors civil war a 
conflict that has cost at least 73000 mostly civilian lives since 
it began in 1979 
the united nations is mediating peace talks between the 
government and the rebels five rounds of talks since may have 
produced little progress 
a bill passed recently by the us congress cut in half the 85 
million in military aid that el salvador receives annually 
beginning in fiscal 1991 
the legislation is aimed at forcing both sides to reach 
agreement on ending the war it stipulates that the aid could be 
restored if the rebels launched an offensive that threatened to 
overthrow the government or be halted altogether if president 
cristianis government refuses to negotiate 
the government communique broadcast friday night claimed the 
missile was one of several supplied to the farabundo marti national 
liberation front rebels also known as fmln by the leftist 
sandinista government in neighboring nicaragua before it 
relinquished power april 25 
such weapons represent extremely dangerous acts that could 
affect the political stability of the country the communique 
said adding that the rebels have been employing the missiles for 
the past 72 hours 
earlier friday the government said the rebels agreed to end an 
offensive they launched last tuesday that killed at least 91 
people but a rebel spokesman denied it and reports of new 
fighting surfaced 
according to government officials the offensive has killed 39 
soldiers 44 rebels and eight civilians and wounded about 300 
people 
the guerrillas claimed over their radio station that the army 
suffered 450 casualties without saying how many were deaths 
the foreign ministers of mexico venezuela and colombia who 
were meeting in mexico city on friday appealed for an end to the 
fighting and urged the two sides to cooperate with the 
unsponsored peace talks

thanksgiving turkeys by the thousands were 
dumped in a landfill after a man started a holiday scare with 
claims he injected some of the birds with cyanide 
health officials said friday they had received no reports of 
poisonings and police said they had no evidence that any turkeys 
actually were laced with cyanide 
the scare began the day before thanksgiving when a man called 
koldtv newswoman barbara grijalva and said he had injected some 
turkeys at smiths food and drug stores in tucson with cyanide 
kold producer rob daniels said the caller said he had a 
problem with smiths and poisoned the turkeys to prove a 
point 
it appears to be simply the work of a hoax of a very sick 
person who either has a grudge to bear against smiths or only 
wished to cause a great deal of anguish among innocent people on 
what should be one of our most joyous holidays said jeff smith 
chairman of the store chain 
smiths offered refunds or exchanges to 4050 people who 
returned turkeys some of which had been cooked employees pulled 
another 550 birds from the shelves 
smiths spokesman jim acton said the scare could cost the chain 
of stores as much as 200000 samples from several turkeys have 
been turned over to the national centers for disease control for 
testing he said 
county health officials received no reports of people 
complaining of symptoms associated with cyanide poisoning said 
james robertson environmental health director

british authorities failed to 
circulate photographs of a bomb in a cassette player before the 
downing of pan am flight 103 because of delay in reproducing the 
pictures an official says 
police believe a similar bomb blew up the boeing 747 over 
lockerbie scotland on dec 21 1988 killing 270 people 
james jack aviation security director of the british department 
of transport also said friday that nine security bulletins his 
agency received before the bombing were not specific enough to 
issue a major alert 
jack speaking before an inquiry in the southern scottish town 
of dumfries said his agency received photographs of the cassette 
player bomb 13 days before the bombing of flight 103 
but he said his agency failed to send the photographs to 
airlines and security staff until 17 days after the downing because 
of the time it took to reproduce them 
i dont wish to divert responsibility for this matter perhaps 
if i had attached an urgent label or taken them round to the 
photographic department myself it would have been done in six 
hours but i put them into a process and unfortunately it was a 
delayed one he testified 
jack did not say who gave him the pictures families of victims 
have said previously that the warning photos were distributed by 
german authorities after german police discovered a bomb inside a 
radio cassette recorder during a raid on suspected terrorists 
jack responded to the widow of one of the flight 103 victims 
who inquired about nine security bulletins from governments 
airlines or security sources that were not circulated before the 
bombing 
that people have been arrested and a device has been

a police spokesman today blamed members of the 
white house press corps for scuffles in which swiss security 
officers jabbed a us diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a 
news photographer 
swiss government officials could not immediately be reached for 
comment on the incidents which occurred during president bushs 
threehour stop in geneva on friday 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater citing brutal and vicious 
treatment said the united states planned to file a protest with 
the swiss government 
us officials told reporters on the presidential plane that 
swiss security officers shoved a machine gun into the stomach of 
american chief of protocol joseph reed and roughed up a traveling 
photographer of the french news agency agence francepresse 
geneva police spokesman thierry magnin today said an 
investigation of the affair is under way but he said some american 
reporters behaved in a deplorable inadmissible way 
they did not respect security measures taken by geneva police 
or swiss territorial sovereignty he said in a telephone 
interview 
there certainly was a row and heated words but this was to 
enforce security measures taken in accord with the american 
security services magnin said 
one police officer at geneva airport friday night said the white 
house press corps behaved like occupying troops 
magnin said he could not comment on the machine gun incident 
but if it happened the submachine gun certainly was not pointed 
at the diplomat he added 
he said the police were simply doing their job and noted they 
have long experience with dignitaries coming through geneva 
theres no misconduct on the contrary they did their job 
well he said 
tension between the white house party and swiss security flared 
already at bushs arrival for a hastily arranged meeting with 
syrias president hafez assad 
white house pool reporters who arrived on a separate chartered 
plane called the arrival a complete zoo with swiss officials 
winning the award as the worst hosts of the trip 
security personnel prevented the washington reporters from 
getting close to bushs plane when he arrived 
a white house official said swiss police minutes before the 
arrival changed media coverage arrangements agreed earlier with 
us security officials 
magnin denied this saying the arrangements had been clearly set 
earlier in the day

as president bush lobbies world leaders for 
support of a un resolution allowing the use of force in the 
persian gulf china still refuses to show its hand 
as a permanent member of the un security council china has 
veto power and has refrained from using it on any of the 10 
resolutions already in effect against iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
but chinas consistent refusal to clarify its position on the 
proposed un resolution casts some doubt on the outcome of the 
vote 
official reports today of a meeting between chinese foreign 
minister qian qichen and his soviet counterpart eduard 
shevardnadze again failed to reveal how china would vote 
the soviet union also a permanent security council member has 
indicated support for the resolution 
a joint statement released belatedly from the friday meeting 
said both sides stand for a political solution to the gulf 
crisis on the basis of relevant un security council resolutions 
they strongly appeal to iraq and demand that it withdraw its 
army from kuwait unconditionally and immediately 
they hold that so far as there is still hope for a peaceful 
solution the international community should continue to work to 
that end and try its best to avoid a war it said 
china has repeatedly avoided making clear how it will vote on 
the useofforce measure 
during an eightday tour of the middle east this month qian did 
not disclose chinas intentions and repeated questions to the 
chinese foreign ministry have been answered with the standard call 
for a peaceful solution 
by doing so it has won praise and recouped international 
prestige lost after beijings military crackdown on a massive 
prodemocracy movement last year 
bush said friday in cairo he was confident the resolution would 
be approved he met with arab leaders in th middle east after 
lobbying heads of state attending a 34nation peace summit in paris 
earlier this week 
chinas most recent statement made today by qians assistant 
xu dunxin indicated that bushs globetrotting efforts have not 
impressed the chinese 
xu attending a conference on the cambodia issue in paris said 
that as long as a gleam of hope of peaceful solutions exists 
the international community should continue efforts for a peaceful 
resolution the official xinhua news agency reported

the public got its first full look at president 
mikhail s gorbachevs plans for sharing power with the 15 soviet 
republics today when major newspapers published a draft of his 
proposed union treaty 
the proposed treaty represented the central governments latest 
attempt to appease secession movements by the republics and smaller 
regions while creating a uniform marketoriented economic system 
at a news conference friday night gorbachev warned that a 
breakup of the soviet union could lead to bloodshed and civil 
conflict and said he would use all his constitutional powers to 
prevent it 
publication of the draft treaty gave the public its first 
glimpse of the proposal in full designed as a charter for a new 
union of sovereign soviet republics 
the draft has already been submitted to the supreme soviet 
legislature and the parliaments of the republics 
to date all but one of the republics kirgizia have declared 
some form of sovereignty 
the three baltic states estonia latvia and lithuania have 
declared independence and say they will not sign a new union 
treaty but they say they are willing to reach political and 
economic agreements with the soviet union and other republics 
the legislature of a fourth republic georgia on friday 
uninamously enacted a law declaring a period of transition in the 
republic pending the restoration of its complete national 
independence and sovereignty the newspaper pravda reported 
today 
during the transition pravda said the parliament of georgia 
regards the signing of a new union treaty as impossible 
at his news conference gorbachev made it clear that republics 
wanting to leave the union must hold a referendum as required 
under existing soviet law he said he would oppose any other form 
of dissolving the union 
if someone tried to impose such a policy it would result in 
bloodshed and civil conflict which would be unacceptable to the 
world community he said 
many of the treatys points were unveiled by gorbachev in the 
supreme soviet last weekend and legislators twice endorsed his 
proposals to reorganize the central government to carry out the 
treaty 
the draft provides for establishing the council of the 
federation which would consist of a vice president the first in 
soviet history and heads of the republics 
the council would determine the main directions of the unions 
domestic and foreign policies the tass news agency said 
the treaty also would create a presidential cabinet formed in 
agreement between the president and the surpeme soviet tass said 
the cabinet would replace the current council of ministers headed 
by prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov 
under the draft treaty each republic as a sovereign state 
has full state powers over its territory treaty participants 
regard the soviet union as a sovereign federative state formed as a 
result of the republics voluntary union 
republics would independently determine their state structure 
administrativeterritorial division and the system of the bodies of 
power and administration the draft says 
in defining the sharing of power between the kremlin and the 
republics the draft treaty proclaimed the supremacy of republic 
legislation over republics territories on all questions except 
those which are referred to the jurisdiction of the union 
the central government would be empowered to adopt a new 
constitution protect the countrys borders and ensure the states 
security the kremlin would continue to control the armed forces 
and be responsible for defense matters the space program railway 
air and sea travel and the administration of the fuel and energy 
system 
the kremlin would also determine the countrys economic 
development and the creation of conditions for the development of 
the allunion market

amid charges that prime minister margaret thatcher 
was undermined by her own party an opinion poll released today 
indicated three candidates for her job would bring the 
conservatives an election victory 
under mrs thatchers leadership the governing party had 
trailed labor in opinion polls for 16 months labor is the main 
opposition party in parliament 
but a poll of about 1100 voters friday found that more voters 
preferred either former defense secretary michael heseltine or 
chancellor of the exchequer john major to labor party leader neil 
kinnock 
foreign secretary douglas hurd would put the tories neck and 
neck with labor with hurd having a slight edge according to the 
poll taken by icm for the sunday correspondent newspaper the poll 
was published today 
fortyseven percent of people asked would vote for heseltine 
compared with 38 percent who would vote labor according to the 
poll of 1139 people major received 46 percent of the vote 
compared with 39 percent for labor and hurd had 43 percent of the 
vote compared with labors 41 percent the poll showed 
no margin of error was given no poll can be 100 percent 
accurate however and there is usually a margin of error of at 
least two or three percentage points with a sample of that size 
poll watchers said 
the 372 conservative party members of the house of commons will 
vote for a leader on tuesday if none of the three candidates 
receives a majority a third ballot will be held thursday 
mrs thatcher resigned on thursday after it appeared she would 
lose a conservative party leadership vote to haseltine who had 
made a strong showing in a first round of leadership balloting last 
tuesday 
hurd and major cabinet ministers no longer shackled by loyalty 
immediately jumped into the leadership contest with heseltine 
the latest poll is similar to the findings of a harris poll 
released friday by independent television news that also predicted 
an upturn in conservative party fortunes under a new prime 
minister 
that poll of 1107 voters on thursday found that the 
conservatives with any of the three candidates as leader would 
beat labor if a general election were held immediately a general 
election must be held before mid1992 
the poll found voters ranked the candidates in the same order 
with heseltine leading labor by 10 points major by seven points 
and hurd by four no margin of error was given in the harris poll 
 
supporters of the 65yearold mrs thatcher have angrily accused 
conservatives of what one called political matricide in forcing 
her to quit after 15 years as party leader and 11 years as prime 
minister 
high inflation rising interest rates an unpopular new tax and 
her lone opposition among european community leaders to financial 
and political integration were among factors that undermined her 
support 
cabinet colleagues and campaign managers told her she could not 
muster enough support to win in further balloting next week 
her opponents in the party feared that under her continuing 
leadership the conservatives would lose to labor at the next 
general election labor has been in opposition since 1979 
conservative legislators returning home for the weekend were met 
friday by anger from grassroots backers of mrs thatcher 
peter stainforth local conservative party treasurer at 
stevenage about 25 miles north of central london reported 
particular rancor over sir geoffrey howe the deputy prime minister 
quit on nov 1 and bitterly attacked mrs thatcher in a commons 
speech on nov 13 
i cannot express how the constituency feels about that 
latterday brutus who was the first to plunge his dagger into his 
leaders back stainforth said

president bush meets with mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari on monday intent on providing impetus 
for what both countries hope will be a new era of crossborder 
economic activity 
high on the agenda for the sixth meeting between bush and 
salinas in two years will be a proposed usmexican free trade 
agreement that would complement a similar pact the united states 
reached with canada in 1988 
bush and salinas will meet in the northern mexican city of 
monterrey where aside from formal talks time has been set aside 
during bushs 28hour stay for a rodeo abarbecue and a fireworks 
display salinas also has an ancestral home nearby which bush will 
visit 
bush is plunging ahead with relish on the effort to forge a free 
trade agreement telling the mexican news agency notimex in an 
interview published thursday we want to do it as soon as 
possible 
during a june meeting in washington bush and salinas said a 
free trade agreement fta would be a powerful engine for 
economic development creating new jobs and opening new markets 
fta advocates say a booming mexico would slow illegal emigration 
to the united states estimated to be as much as 2 million entries 
a year and create a lucrative markets for us exports 
but critics warn that an fta could touch off an exodus of jobs 
from the united states to mexico and its lower wage labor markets 
some in the administration predict a trade agreement could be in 
hand within a year while others are looking to 1992 as a more 
likely timetable 
unless congress rules otherwise formal talks on transforming 
economic ties along the 2000mile border will get under way in the 
spring 
the monterrey talks also will touch on us concerns about a 
dramatic upswing in transshipments of colombian cocaine through 
mexico mexico continues to be the largest foreign source of 
marijuana sold in the united states and one of the largest sources 
of heroin 
however a new state department report says there has been a 
significant increase in drug enforcement activities by mexican 
authorities over the past two years although corruption continues 
to be a problem the report says mexico has seized record amounts 
of drugs in the twoyear period 
but the prospective trade agreement will be the main topic at 
the monterrey talks 
the concept has been endorsed by private groups such as the us 
chamber of commerce the bilateral commission on the future of 
usmexican relations and the mexicounited states institute 
the benefits are obvious for mexico which sits adjacent to what 
is perhaps the largest market in the world 300 million mostly 
prosperous americans and canadians 
salinas is banking on the notion that the rivers of technology 
and investment which have bypassed mexico over the years going 
instead to asia and recently to eastern europe will flow into his 
country once a free trade area extending from the yukon to the 
yucatan is in place 
particularly attractive to potential investors is the relatively 
low wage scale mexico offers compared with the united states and 
canada as an example a us government study shows that the 
average hourly wage at foreign operated assembly plants along the 
mexican side of the us border is 163 compared with 1432 in 
the united states 
some in the united states warn that the american workers will be 
big losers under an fta 
rep don j pease dohio a member of the house ways and means 
trade subcommittee wonders whether an fta will have a depressing 
effect on us wages 
one certainly suspects so pease says this is the kind of 
issue that needs to be addressed extensively and soon

when it hauled a million tons of bullets and 
beans to the persian gulf at the outset of operation desert shield 
the pentagon likened the task to moving a city the size of 
chattanooga tenn halfway around the world 
its moving time again but with a european twist 
half of all us army forces in europe with hundreds of 63ton 
battle tanks artillery pieces rocket launchers and tons of other 
heavy equipment are heading for the saudi desert to reinforce the 
230000 us troops there the exact number of army reinforcements 
is secret but probably near 100000 
it ranks as the biggest us military exodus from europe since 
the end of world war ii 
some of the armys apache helicopters already have traveled the 
rhine river by barge to major ports in belgium holland and germany 
where they are being loaded aboard fast sealift ships for a 
nineday voyage to the arabian peninsula 
the troops will follow later although departure dates have not 
been set said sgt jd hardesty a spokesman at us army europe 
headquarters in heidelberg germany 
theyll be joined by more than 20000 navy sailors now gearing 
up to steam to the gulf 45000 marines from across the united 
states at least 16500 members of the armys big red one 1st 
infantry division mechanized from fort riley kan and thousands 
of military reservists called up to support the new deployments 
its a logistical challenge on a scale topped only by the first 
wave of american deployments to the gulf which itself was the 
largest shortnotice military airlift and sealift in american 
history according to the defense department the first wave of 
desert shield deployments all started from the united states 
this time the job should be less daunting because of the 
benefit of lessons learned from the first goround and because of 
the shorter distance the heavy armored units in europe and their 
supplies will have to travel 
and because a large defensive us force already is in saudi 
arabia speed of transport is less critical than in the early 
stages of the crisis when us officials feared that iraqi forces 
might make a run at the saudi oil fields so equipment this time 
can be moved entirely by sea rather than rushed by air 
on the other hand the task is complicated by the fact that it 
must take place at the same time spare parts and other supplies are 
flowing into the gulf for the army navy air force and marine 
corps units already deployed there 
president bushs decision in august to send us troops to the 
gulf caught military logistics planners off guard and while few 
people foresaw that bush on nov 8 would order as many as 200000 
additional troops to go the transportation commands say they were 
ready 
sealift ships began moving toward loading ports within hours 
of the presidents announcement said a military sealift command 
official who asked not to be identified we are not beginning the 
second lift from a standing start 
tricia larson a sealift command spokeswoman said about 160 
sealift ships are operating now including seven fast sealift 
vessels that can travel at 33 knots and 41 slower cargo ships 
activated from the ready reserve fleet a sort of 96ship 
navyinwaiting that is used in emergencies 
the pentagon also has been forced to charter 59 cargo ships of 
which 45 are flying foreign flags and 22 petroleum tankers of 
which five are foreignflagged ms larson said 
the marine corps is mobilizing marine prepositioning ship 
squadron 1 from norfolk va the unit consists of five ships that 
carry tanks trucks armored vehicles fuel food and other 
supplies to keep 16500 marines combat ready for 30 days 
most us troops will be flown to saudi arabia by commercial 
airliners as happened during the initial buildup when for the 
first time ever the us transportation command mobilized the 
civil reserve air fleet that in effect meant the pentagon 
commandeered a fleet of 29 us commercial airliners for its own 
use 
sgt scott leas a spokesman for the military airlift command at 
scott air force base ill said the commercial aircraft are still 
at the pentagons disposal he said it was too early to say whether 
extra commercial jets would be needed 
its all in the planning stage he said 
the military airlift command is expected to use most of its 
fleet of military cargo planes which includes 127 c5 galaxies for 
large and heavy cargo 266 c141 starlifters for less bulky 
lighterweight vehicles and equipment and 660 smaller c130

pope john paul ii on saturday said the 
vatican and vietnam are moving toward reconciliation and he is 
hopeful the church can achieve full freedom in the communist 
country 
in a climate of mutual respect understanding and good will a 
dialogue has begun which augurs well for the future the pope 
said in a speech to 21 visiting vietnamese bishops 
john paul said he based his assessment on the results of a visit 
to vietnam earlier this month by an official vatican delegation 
cardinal roger etchegary head of the vaticans justice and peace 
commission held talks with officials in hanoi and elsewhere on 
churchstate issues 
the road will still be long and the difficulties will not be 
lacking but it seems that it is the right path the pope said in 
french i hope that in the near future the vietnamese church 
finds that the place which it deserves in society is ever more 
recognized 
be assured he told the bishops that the holy see will do 
all in its power so that these first steps in dialogue can lead to 
an understanding which brings lasting fruit for the good of the 
church of vietnam 
there are an estimated 4 to 5 million catholics among vietnams 
largely buddhist population of 63 million 
while restrictions on catholics and other believers have eased 
in recent years several problems with the vatican remain one 
major issue is the appointment of archbishops for vacant posts in 
hanoi hue and ho chi minh city 
in his address to the pope the head of the vietnamese bishops 
conference lamented that bishops are lacking in five dioceses and 
that there are virtually no priests in northern vietnam 
monsignor paul marie nguyen minh nhat bishop of xuan loc in 
southern vietnam said authorities continue to restrict the number 
of seminary students the activities of religious congregations and 
the availability of religious education 
the difficulties are multiplying with time as the needs of 
the community increase and the missionary personnel decreases he 
said 
the pope said the vietnamese church is suffering from a shortage 
of priests and an aging clergy he said he hoped priestly 
candidates finishing seminary studies will be able to be ordained 
freely and begin their ministry as soon as possible 
according to a church report last year only 15 priests have 
been ordained since the communist takeover in 1975 
john paul noted that vietnam has only four seminaries with two 
others scheduled to open soon 
i fervently hope that no obstacle is put in the way and that 
you can receive the candidates in these centers without any 
limitation on their numbers he said 
two years ago the hanoi government protested the popes 
canonization of 117 martyrs killed in vietnam in the 18th and 19th 
centuries 
the pope said visiting bishops were in rome to pay tribute to 
the martyred saints 
it is moving to think that you live your episcopal ministry 
under the patronage of these saints he said

western diplomats acutely aware of hidden 
microphones are talking to the walls in baghdad they hope to send 
the message that the threat of war is real and that the result will 
be devastating 
its not that iraqs leaders believe president bush is bluffing 
the diplomats say they recognize theres a danger of war but they 
remain confident they can outlast the threat the sanctions and the 
international coalition aligned against them 
were trying to convince them that its real and imminent a 
western diplomat said were trying to show them what theyre 
facing were walking around talking to the walls telling them 
about b52 strikes 
we talk about our own fears and hope the message is passed 
along to president saddam husseins inner circle by the iraqi 
intelligence agencies bugging them 
saddam will not back down or withdraw from kuwait as long as he 
believes he can withstand the embargo break the international will 
behind it and forestall attack with clever hostage releases and 
behindthescenes deals the diplomats contend 
the diplomats argue that saddam now cannot afford to invade 
kuwait and then just cave in to international pressure 
the iraqi people are already questioning why they fought for 
eight years with iran only to give all the gains away after the 
invasion of kuwait 
so the diplomats say he plays for time dealing with hostages 
and hinting to visiting delegations that perhaps just perhaps 
theres a chance to talk to negotiate 
iraqs plan to release all its hundreds of foreign hostages in 
batches between christmas and march 25 is cited as an example of 
how iraq believes it can forestall attack 
iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity candidly 
admit that the threat of war is the highest between late december 
and march and that the hostage release is a manuever to delay bush 
and weaken the american resolve to attack 
the officials say they have tried other means including 
attempts to talk with the americans through back channel diplomatic 
contacts but they say the americans have never responded 
people on the street in baghdad seem less afraid of war then 
they did in late august and september when the allied troop buildup 
in saudi arabia was just beginning 
there will be no war america is a great country a country 
that cares for its people it wont waste their lives in a war 
said one baghdad resident who asked to be identified only as 
yousef 
his sentiments were repeated often by other iraqis and by some 
indian and moroccan workers who have elected to stay at their jobs 
in iraq despite the crisis 
some western diplomats say the public has been lulled to sleep 
by the iraqi propaganda machine that daily prints stories of 
growing opposition to war in america and the west and growing world 
support for saddam and the cause of peace 
but other diplomats say that many in iraq who have benefited 
from some of saddams policies are convinced he is a cunning and 
clever man who will prevent the war and survive the crisis 
this is a republic of fear no doubt said one asian 
diplomat but its also a country where the common man has 
benefited greatly its not a pyramid standing only on fear of 
saddam hussein 
despite the economic sanctions spot shortages of some goods 
and soaring prices for others many iraqis believe the crisis is 
only a shortterm inconvienence 
america will never go to war over kuwait said one baghdad 
who gave his name as ahmed why should it 
for the most part its business as usual in iraq there are 
noisy wedding parties outside the big hotels and celebrations for 
prisoners of war repatriated from iran 
they know iraq is a potentially very rich country the asian 
diplomat said its sitting on the worlds secondlargest 
reserves of oil

twenty years after celebrated novelist yukio 
mishimas spectacular harakiri the dream of a resurgent japanese 
imperialism he died espousing seems as distant as ever 
i cant think of a single lasting effect his death had 
said donald richie a cultural critic who has lived in japan four 
decades 
mishima regarded as one of the leading japanese authors of this 
century scandalized the nation when he committed ritual 
disembowelment at a tokyo military base nov 25 1970 at age 45 
just minutes before his suicide mishima and four young members 
of his small private militia took a general hostage and demanded 
that troops stationed at the base hastily assemble on the parade 
ground 
in a speech from a balcony parapet he urged the soldiers to 
arms to regain glory for the japanese military and the emperor he 
also denounced the postwar constitution that renounces war and 
limits the emperors role to state symbol 
ending his failed heckled speech with the cry long live the 
emperor mishima hurried indoors stripped to his loincloth and 
plunged a footlong dagger into his lower abdomen cutting 
crosswise the horrific suicide ended when one of the youths 
decapitated mishima with a sword 
japan had hardly seen such ritual suicide since the immediate 
aftermath of world war ii and there were immediate worries that 
mishimas actions could help revive the militarism that launched 
the horrifying pacific war 
but his appeals went unheeded by all except a small fringe of 
rightwing extremists today the revived militarism he advocated 
appears more unlikely than ever 
the widespread opposition to a recent government proposal to 
deploy troops overseas for the first time since world war ii 
certainly suggests that his notions of reestablishing the 
imperial army do not have popular support in the country 
said j victor koschmann a visiting history professor at the 
stanford center in kyoto 
the lukewarm public interest in this months enthronement of 
emperor akihito also indicates little support for reviving the 
prewar status of monarch as a living god to be fanatically 
worshipped 
other than a small fringe for whom hes still a cult figure 
of sorts i just dont think mishima has that broad an appeal 
koschmann said 
the anniversary is passing mostly in embarrassed silence 
although one rightwing group will hold a rally sunday to be 
followed by a march through tokyo to the base where mishima 
committed suicide only a few thousand are expected to attend 
some newspapers and magazines have carried articles and 
photographs on mishima in the days before the anniversary and at 
least six books on mishima have been published recently 
mishimas novels plays and short stories are known for 
reflecting the conflict between the encroaching west and 
traditional japanese values a conflict that mishima felt intensely 
himself 
the works often reveal an obsession with beauty death and 
suicide 
among his bestknown novels are confessions of a mask 
1949 a partly autobiographical account of a boys selfawakening 
that includes themes of homosexuality found in many of mishimas 
later works another popular novel was the temple of the golden 
pavilion 1956 an examination of what led an ugly young monk 
obsessed with the beauty of a buddhist temple to burn it down 
mishimas works are widely studied among literature students at 
japanese universities 
i think that people like mishima because his novels create a 
strong sense of japanese traditional beauty said jiro kawamura 
a literature professor at the tokyo metropolitan university 
he is a very problematic important novelist but i dont 
think he is a great novelist said kawamura his work is full 
of rhetoric he is not a genius

president bush returned home today saying he is close to getting 
the support he needs for un approval of force against iraq while 
secretary of state james a baker iii met on the gulf crisis with 
officials in colombia 
in beijing spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
said a un security council resolution authorizing force to 
liberate kuwait could be passed before the end of november 
a day earlier britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said 
the un security council probably would meet next week to discuss 
the issue it was the first indication enough support had been 
gathered for the measure 
the soviet unions un envoy also said friday foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze would attend a security council meeting next 
week to discuss iraqi aggression and to issue a strong serious 
and precise warning to baghdad 
saddam hussein called on his warhardened reservists to help 
defend the emirate which he invaded on aug 2 in a dispute over 
oil land and money 
bush and baker have been lobbying world leaders on behalf of the 
useofforce measure baker made a fourhour visit today to bogota 
colombia one of ten nonpermanent members of the un security 
council 
he was on the last leg of a fiveday whirlind tour of security 
council member states but in meetings with colombian president 
cesar gaviria trujillo and other officials he failed to gain 
support for a resolution on force 
colombian foreign minister luis jaramillo said colombia has not 
yet decided how it would vote in a resolution approving force 
finding peaceful solutions to conflicts is a fundamental 
thesis within colombia foreign policy jaramillo said at a joint 
news conference with baker 
however he said colombia stands firm with the world community 
in rejecting iraqi aggression colombia has voted in favor of all 
previous security council resolutions on iraq 
the spanish foreign minister said he believed a resolution on 
force would be passed by the end of november 
ive always had the impression that it was possible such a 
resolution would pass this month fernandez ordonez said after 
meeting with chinese leaders in beijing today he made it clear 
however that his view did not result from discussions with the 
chinese 
china has refused to say how it would vote on a possible 
resolution on military force as one of the five permanent security 
council members china has veto power over resolutions the other 
permanent members are britain france the soviet union and the 
united states 
but bush said friday he was confident he would get approval from 
the 15member security council 
there had been reports of disagreement between bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev when they met earlier this week in 
paris but gorbachev denied that at a news conference friday 
i can tell you that meeting i had with president bush only 
reinforced our cooperation he said he repeated his call for the 
security council to meet in the near future 
in his latest meeting bush held talks in geneva friday with 
syrian president afez assad assad declined to tell reporters 
whether syria would participate in any military offensive against 
iraq 
syria has sent some 7500 ground troops to participate in the 
multinational force against iraq it has promised 15000 
in amman jordan today the parliament bitterly attacked 
washington for intervening in the gulf crisis and condemned saudi 
arabia for allowing western troops on its soil 
proiraqi sentiments run high in jordan which has a majority of 
palestinians they view saddam as leading the struggle to liberate 
their homeland from israeli occupation 
about 26 nations have deployed some 350000 troops in the gulf 
region including 250000 us personnel they face an estimated 
460000 iraqi troops stationed in kuwait and southern iraq 
the latest iraqi callup announced in a defense ministry 
communique broadcast on baghdad radio involves reservists in their 
30s including battletested veterans of the 198088 iraniraq war 
they apparently will be among 150000 reservists and draftees 
that iraq said earlier this week would be sent to kuwait along 
with about 100000 other regular army troops 
since the iraqi invasion the united nations has passed 10 
resolutions against baghdad including a global trade embargo 
britains hurd told reporters in london that soon probably 
next week the security council will consider a draft resolution 
authorizing member states to use force to bring about the reversal 
of the iraqi aggression 
the soviet ambassador to the united nations yuliy m vorontsov 
also said the security council would meet next week to discuss 
iraqi aggression but did not specify whether the measure on force 
would be discussed he said shevardnadze would attend 
the urgency is in part because yemen which has tilted toward 
iraq in the past takes over the rotating chairmanship of the 
security council from the united states in december

when sen dennis deconcini met with the 
nations top thrift regulator in 1987 he made references to a memo 
that proposed a deal favorable to sampl owner charles h keating jr 
according to a sworn statement before the senate ethics committee 
the question of whether the arizona democrat actually offered a 
deal on keatings behalf is crucial to the ethics investigation of 
deconcini and four senate colleagues 
deconcini has repeatedly denied making such an offer the sworn 
statement given by someone who did not attend the 1987 meeting 
says only that deconcini made verbal references to a memo 
outlining a proposal for keating 
the ethics committee is trying to determine whether the 
socalled keating five improperly pressured sampl regulators on 
behalf of keating a major political donor the other senators are 
john mccain rariz donald w riegle jr dmich alan cranston 
dcalif and john glenn dohio 
the sworn statement was given to the committee last august by 
glenns administrative assistant mary jane veno and released last 
week 
according to the affidavit ms veno told the committee what she 
learned from deconcinis administrative assistant about the april 
2 1987 meeting between four senators all except riegle and top 
regulator edwin j gray 
no senate staffers attended the meeting ms veno said she was 
told about the memo by gene karp who said friday that his 
recollection of their conversation differs from hers 
the 1987 meeting is important because gray insists that 
deconcini then offered a quid pro quo on keatings behalf 
gray said an essential part of the offer was that keatings 
lincoln savings and loan would offer more home mortgages if 
regulators would exempt lincoln from a rule limiting risky 
investments 
committee special counsel robert s bennett said in his opening 
statement the evidence shows that deconcini offered the deal 
but deconcini has denied it in the strongest possible terms and 
cranston glenn and mccain back him on that point 
in the sworn statement ms veno said that some time after 
allegations of a deal for keating became public in late 1989 karp 
called her at home he explained that sen deconcini had brought 
the memorandum with him to the april 2 meeting and during the 
meeting had made verbal references to the subjects discussed in 
the memorandum she told the committee 
the memorandum dated march 19 1987 was from deconcini staffer 
laurie a sedlmayr to her boss it detailed what american 
continental lincolns parent company wants from gray for 
concessions and what american continental is willing to do 
ms sedlmayr is scheduled to testify monday when the committee 
resumes its hearings 
karp said friday that since the 1987 meeting was held in 
deconcinis office the memo was available to the senator but karp 
said he did not know if deconcini actually referred to it 
in an interview karp said he could not recall exactly what he 
told ms veno but as i remember it now gray said at the very 
beginning he didnt know anything about lincoln and deconcini never 
got into the subject matter of the investigation or anything about 
that whether there was any specific reference made i cant 
answer only the principals that were there can answer it 
karp added that he does not recall telling ms veno that 
deconcini made verbl references to the memo and i find it 
difficult to imagine that i said that 
ms veno could not be reached for comment on her statement or 
karps 
the aides received information on the meetings from the 
senators but had no firsthand knowledge since only the four 
senators and gray were in the room and no transcript of the session 
exists 
ms veno also said in her statement that when she queried glenn 
about the april 2 meeting the senator said he did not recall 
sen deconcini making such statements about a deal nor did he 
believe such statements were made 
but she added that glenn also said it was possible that sen 
deconcini raised this issue in his opening remarks at the meeting 
and that sen glenn was not focusing on sen deconcinis comments 
at the time 
the purpose of the factfinding hearings which began nov 15 
is to decide whether any of the five senators improperly pressured 
regulators on behalf of keating who along with associates 
contributed 13 million to their campaigns and causes 
much of the money was donated while the businessman was fighting 
regulators during their intense investigation of lincoln the 
irvine calif thrift that was seized by the government in april 
1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than 2 
billion

here are sketches of the main candidates 
in polands first direct democratic presidential election sunday 
 
lech walesaequals 
the 47yearold with an astonishing mix of political instinct 
and personal charisma has arguably done more than any other 
individual to topple communism and says the presidency is his next 
responsiblity he contends even more must be reformed if poland is 
to become a true democracy 
born to a dirtpoor farm family in a remote hamlet walesa had a 
tradeschool education when he drifted to the baltic port of gdansk 
and took a job at the lenin shipyard in 1967 
increasingly incensed by the workers lot and dispiriting 
totalitarian rule especially after the bloody repression of 
strikes in 1970 walesa lost one job after another to his 
activism he was unemployed and outside the strikebound shipyard 
when he made his famous leap over the gate to lead solidaritys 
founding in 1980 
interned after martial law in december 1981 and awarded the 
nobel peace prize in 1983 walesa maneuvered the solidarity 
movement through years of repression to its takeover of the 
government in 1989 
after creating the solidarity government against dubious 
colleagues advice walesa found himself on the political sidelines 
in gdansk but increasingly alarmed by social discontent apathy and 
disaffection with the new government 
he can be autocratic and contradictory demagogic 
irresponsible and uncultured to his critics but the walesa of the 
twinkling eyes mesmerizing speech tothepeople style and 
enormous courage still holds immense sway 
 
tadeusz mazowieckiequals 
the 63yearold prime minister became eastern europes first 
noncommunist government leader in august 1989 launched the 
regions most dramatic economic overhaul on jan 1 and says poland 
needs his team to stay and finish the job 
mazowieckis devout catholicism led him to oppose the 
thencommunist government during the 1950s he founded the 
influential club of catholic intellectuals in warsaw and the 
monthly magazine wiez 
in 1961 he joined the parliament delegation of znak a tiny 
officially condoned independent group protected by the church but 
eventually his principles clashed with the communists bounds of 
tolerance after he demanded an investigation into the 1970 
killings of strikeing workers he was barred from reelection 
mazowiecki joined walesa in the founding days of solidarity in 
august 1980 he brought a letter of support from intellectuals to 
the strikebound gdansk shipyard and stayed imprisoned during 
martial law the taciturn lawyer negotiated with communists in 1989 
at historic talks and submitted the court motion winning back 
solidaritys legal status 
proposed for prime minister by walesa mazowiecki has become 
increasingly confident though never comfortable under the 
international spotlight but the two split along with the 
onceunited solidarity movement over the whether mazowieckis 
deliberate reasoned course to reform is too slow 
 
stanislaw tyminskiequals 
the virtually unknown 42yearold emigre with polish canadian 
and peruvian citizenship grabbed the spotlight late in the campaign 
when one poll showed him in second place trailing only walesa 
tyminski says he left poland penniless 21 years ago going first 
to sweden as a tourist and then emigrating to canada where he 
became a millionaire he started a cable television outfit and a 
restaurant in the amazon port of iquitos peru and then returned 
to canada where he runs transduction ltd a computer automation 
firm near toronto he leads the libertarian party of canada a 
fringe party that has no representative in parliament 
tyminski financing his own campaign attracted supporters 
disenchanted with polands drastic economic reforms who responded 
to his harsh criticism of the government but his credentials went 
largely unchallenged until his surge in the polls then journalists 
started to question his long absence from poland and state 
prosecutors launched a slander investigation after he accused 
mazowiecki of treason against the nation

president bush expressing growing impatience 
appears grimly determined to show he is willing to go to war 
against iraq to end its takeover of kuwait 
the resounding message of bushs justconcluded trip through 
europe and the middle east was that time is running out for a 
peaceful retreat by iraqi president saddam hussein 
for the first time bush raised the possibility of setting a 
deadline for baghdad 
he also spoke bluntly of a commitment to use force and he 
offered a chilling justification for amassing military forces 
against iraq warning that saddam was moving closer to building an 
arsenal of nuclear weapons 
the world is getting tired of this bush declared of iraqs 
nearly fourmonth occupation of kuwait 
bushs theme was that he hopes for a peaceful resolution but is 
laying the foundation for possible war he said he was not 
bluffing 
prodded by the united states the united nations security 
council is expected to meet within days on a measure authorizing 
force to remove iraq 
bush said the united states is very close to winning un 
approval even without it he said we have the authority to do 
what we have to do 
congress was uneasy about bushs saberrattling before his trip 
and the hardening of his rhetoric is sure to raise new concerns 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said he would urge 
congress to reconvene immediately if the united nations endorsed a 
resolution on force he said he hoped congress also would endorse 
force 
bush made the persian gulf crisis the constant centerpiece of 
his eightday trip to czechoslovakia germany a 34nation summit 
in paris saudi arabia and egypt 
were not walking away until our mission is done until the 
invader is out of kuwait bush told marines and british desert 
rats during a thanksgiving day visit to a remote desert outpost 
in saudi arabia and that may be where you come in 
the 230000 american troops in the persian gulf and 200000 
more on the way give real credence to the presidents implied 
threat 
yet despite bushs resolve there are signs of wear in the 
global coalition against iraq and there is reluctance or mixed 
signals from some nations about the military option 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev counseled patience to 
allow diplomacy to work so did german chancellor helmut kohl 
warning of the consequences of war 
on the other hand margaret thatcher ordered 14000 more british 
troops to the gulf even as she announced her resignation as prime 
minister 
bush got public backing from egypt and saudi arabia for using 
force and syria agreed that iraqs aggression must not stand 
however there were divisions in the arab world 
yemen which will assume the rotating chairmanship of the 
security council in december criticized the military buildup in 
the gulf and refused to endorse tougher action 
yemens attitude is a key reason why bush wants un action 
before the end of the month when the united states has to 
relinquish the council chairmanship 
secretary of state james a baker iii who has circled the globe 
in recent days lobbying for tougher action cautioned against the 
siren song of partial solutions 
and baker said disapprovingly that some nations are beginning to 
talk of allowing iraq to hold on to disputed islands in the gulf or 
be granted access to the gulf 
socalled partial solutions are out of the question bush 
declared 
stopping in cairo bush vowed were going to pull this 
coalition together were going to keep this coalition together and 
were going to see what happens 
egyptian president hosni mubarak known for his caution spoke 
gloomily about prospects for a peaceful ending i am 
pessimistic he said i dont see the slightest movement by 
saddam 
if he needed it bush got encouragement for quick action from 
some of the american troops he visited in saudi arabia and aboard 
the amphibious assault ship uss nassau in the persian gulf 
we either want to fight or we want to go home said marine 
lance cpl david kimmel of jonestown pa 
i wish it would happen because im tired of being here 
agreed lance cpl doug mitchell of hattiesburg miss 
troy knapp a 19yearold corporal from denver said he thought 
bush was looking for a military solution youre going to wonder 
if hell take the political heat for keeping the troops here for 
another five months knapp said 
bush told the troops no american will be kept in the gulf a 
single day longer than necessary but we wont pull punches we are 
not here on some exercise this is a real world situation 
bush has refused to specify how long hell wait for sanctions to 
work against iraq but he said that at the united nations well 
be discussing not only the need to consider further action but 
perhaps a time frame

suddenly it all looks gray the prime minister 
who told britons not to be moaning minnies who bustled around 
the globe handbag at the ready who stamped her authority on this 
nation as no other leader since winston churchill is finished 
margaret thatcher went as she came eyes ablaze in the house of 
commons seeking no sympathy and admitting no error though she had 
been overthrown by her own conservative party 
some loyalists and some who had abandoned her were near tears 
but she didnt flinch as she headed into the house of commons to 
defend her record against an opposition noconfidence motion just 
hours after admitting defeat 
im enjoying this she shouted during one raucous 
interruption 
style was part of the substance of margaret thatcher who 
imposed her personality on britain for more than 11 years it was 
her great strength and ultimately her tragic flaw 
fifty percent of thatcherism was this extraordinary style 
this character this abrasion said biographer hugo young the 
power of a person to dominate events and the way we see them to 
dominate our conversations and to make politics part of the saloon 
bar and drawing room life of britain 
challenged for the leadership and forced into a runoff the party 
elders said shed lose mrs thatcher withdrew thursday 
when the new leader of the party and the government is chosen 
this week by conservative legislators it will be the end of the 
thatcher era 
in the end it came over europe in part it was her total 
resistance to a single european currency as opposed to the 
neartotal resistance of most of the british cabinet that did it 
but mainly it was style dismissing proposals for political 
unity at a european commuinity summit in rome last month as a 
ragbag then turning on her resentful longsuffering deputy 
sir geoffrey howe at a cabinet meeting 
that was the last straw for howe who resigned and then 
unburdened himself in a savage resignation speech he had 
despaired he said of working for a woman who pursued a running 
argument with the official line of her own government 
margaret thatcher simply couldnt play along with her european 
partners on their wideranging but still vague proposals and wait 
as she insisted they would for things to fall apart in 
negotiations thats not my style she snapped at a questioner 
ten years ago she talked about the rush of adrenalin that came 
in a really good fight i stand there and i know now come on 
maggie you are wholly on your own no one can help you and i 
love it 
her ways were often reated as being peculiarly feminine and 
a handbagging became the cliche for one of her rages 
most women defend themselves she said on her 10th 
anniversary in power it is the female of the species it is the 
tigress and the lioness in you which tends to defend when 
attacked 
at summits foreign reporters packed her news conferences she 
always had something to say and cut right through the diplomatic 
parlance the big words and the hazy evasions 
she may have been more popular abroad than at home 
during thursdays session of the house of commons a tory 
lawmaker said an american popularity poll had showed mikhail 
gorbachev at 74 percent george bush at 75 percent and mrs 
thatcher at 94 percent 
i am sure that they were quite right too she said 
she was mobbed in leninikan in soviet armenia in june when she 
came to inspect earthquake relief efforts children threw 
carnations and shouted we love you 
she seemed on a permanent crusade whether facing down the labor 
unions or attending a cocktail party 
you have to put her in the same category as bloody mary queen 
elizabeth i queen anne and queen victoria said lord hailsham 
who served in thatcher cabinets from 197987 before retiring as 
lord chancellor the nations top legal officer 
her handling of men is not dissimilar if you had been a 
courtier of elizabeth i you would never quite know whether you 
were going to get the treatment of an admired friend or a poke in 
the eye with an umbrella 
like her friend ronald reagan she was devoted to a few clear 
ideas but unlike him she was seldom caught unprepared on the 
details and intricacies of policy 
she espoused what she called victorian values and her 
lectures to the nation ranged from the evils of socialism to the 
virtues of tidyness 
perhaps because of her mused the financial times britain no 
longer needs a strong leader one must hope so it added for 
it is most unlikely to enjoy such leadership again within a 
generation here was a thatcher when comes such another

chancellor helmut kohl whose swift 
unification of his country astonished fans and critics alike seems 
assured of victory in the first allgerman elections since 1933 
opinion polls forecast an easy win for the chancellor dec 2 
over oskar lafontaine and the social democrats 
lafontaine has made too many mistakes especially in his 
early reluctance to support reunification and has little chance 
of winning said dieter roth of the institute for election 
analysis and society research in mannheim 
the social democratic leader argued germany was moving too 
rapidly for the countrys good and rightly as it is turning out 
that unification would cost more than predicted 
in a new poll by the respected allensbach institute kohls 
conservative coalition won 537 percent approval compared to 334 
percent for the social democrats kohl led by 22 percent in a poll 
based solely on the two mens personal appeal 
at rallies kohl confidently predicts a bright future while 
lafontaine speaks of higher taxes and a total bill of up to 137 
billion for bringing the former east germany up to western 
germanys standards 
kohl made a campaign trip to eastern border city of frankfurt an 
der oder perhaps to remind voters that he and tadeusz mazowiecki 
prime minister of poland met there nov 8 and settled the 
longdisputed boundary 
more than 10000 people filled the bonn market square for an 
evening rally and cheered when the chancellor walked into the crowd 
to shake hands 
in his speech kohl mentioned his success in uniting the country 
and said i need no lessons from that man from saarbruecken a 
reference to lafontaine 
the challenger held his own rally in bonn the next evening 
drawing a comparatively quiet crowd of of about 3000 
lafontaine concedes he misjudged kohls ability to retain voter 
loyalty despite the rapidly rising cost of unity 
violence has entered the campaign lafontaine and interior 
minister wolfgang schaeuble were targets of assassination attempts 
forty parties are running candidates but only a few have a real 
chance of winning seats in the bundestag as germany calls its 
parliament 
among the fringe groups are the farmers party of former east 
germany the grey ones a party for senior citizens the womens 
party and the xenophobic german national democrats 
the greens made up of leftists feminists and ecologists are 
worried about losing their traditional audiences to mainstream 
parties polls indicate some greens support is straying but not 
enough to shut them out of the bundestag 
on the far right the republican party had a meteoric rise for 
two years but has lost ground to mainstream parties analysts do 
not expect it to win the 5 percent of the vote needed to obtain 
parliament seats 
east germanys renamed communists are expected to get in even 
though they were caught sending party funds out of the country to 
avoid seizure the party is supported by many eastern germans but 
has a negligible following in former west germany 
the social democrats claim kohl is illequipped to clean up the 
badly polluted environment in eastern germany and is driving 
germany deeper into debt lafontaine has said for months that taxes 
will have to go up 
kohl says unity will not require a tax increase but that 
improving and protecting the environment may germanys most 
serious ecological problems are in the eastern regions 
social unrest in the east is growing with the unemployment 
caused by reunification and kohl acknowledges unity will cost more 
than he expected but many voters have been turned off by 
lafontaines campaign 
analysts cite his habit of criticizing kohls handling of 
reunification without offering credible alternatives lafontaine 
has said consistently that jobs must be protected in former east 
germany for example but has not said how he would do it 
in kohls favor are forecasts even by pessimistic experts that 
the eastern economy will start to turn around in 1991 bringing 
millions of new jobs 
even though some of lafontaines warnings may bear fruit 
political analysts say the public seems to trust kohl to finish 
the job he began 
pessimism can sometimes help win an election but not when the 
populace says there is no alternative to the existing course 
said renate koecher a survey researcher at the allensbach 
institute

iraqs fractious opposition groups are 
plotting ways to topple what they hope will be a weakened saddam 
hussein if he survives an attack to force him to give up kuwait 
but some middle east analysts believe that if the iraqi dictator 
is ousted or killed iraq would be plunged into chaos 
others believe that under international supervision a 
democratic government could be established to preserve order even 
so a crippled iraq would face a period of turbulence 
one may find that theres a vacuum at the center in iraq 
which would lead to a breakdown of authority said analyst philip 
robins of londons royal institute of international affairs 
total chaos could not be ruled out he said a lot depends 
on how he goes and who perpetrates his demise 
robins is among those who believe saddams most likely threat 
would come from within his immediate circles whether that be the 
military or the intelligence apparatus or civilian circles 
western analysts in baghdad have said iraqs army is showing 
signs of disorder because of supply problems purges of 
highranking officers sinking morale and desertions 
analysts familiar with iraqs military machine said the recent 
surprise replacement of the chief of staff lt gen nizar 
alkhazraji indicated opposition to the strategy of holding onto 
kuwait 
there is believed to be significant discontent because saddam 
conceded to irans demands for a final peace in their 198088 war 
saddam made the concessions shortly after he invaded kuwait on aug 
2 and in effect relinquished gains made in the war with iran 
the new chief of staff gen hussein rashid was commander of 
the elite republican guard but some analysts believe even the 
current situation might not be safe for saddam 
the rest of the army may be neutralized said bernard 
trainor a former us marine general who has made several visits 
to iraq 
but the republican guards could turn against him if he takes 
them down the road to national suicide said trainor now head of 
the national security program at harvard universitys kennedy 
school of government 
the iraqi opposition groups operate outside the country and 
they are trying to prepare for the future even if there is no 
military action 
for more than a month theyve been meeting in syria to 
reunite the iraqi opposition which might overthrow the iraqi 
regime even without war said mohammed bakir hakim head of the 
tehranbased iraqi revolutionary supreme council said 
syria ruled by a wing of the baath socialist party that has 
long been at odds with rival baathists in baghdad is sponsoring 
the damascus conference 
robins said the meeting underscores how the opposition groups 
are trying to overcome differences 
still theres little basis of support for any of the groups 
in iraq and no strong individual to fill saddams shoes he said 
the two dozen opposition groups fall into four major categories 
arab nationalists leftists kurds and islamists 
we want a democratic government to have a free election and 
the kurds should be represented in the government genuinely said 
hoshyir zebari the londonbased spokesman for the kurdistan 
democratic party most likely you would find a coalition 
government 
he said the west has been ambiguous in its strategy 
is it to get saddam hussein out of kuwait or is it to depose 
him zebari asked he said that getting rid of saddam is the 
only way peace could prevail in the region 
president bush strongly hinted last week during a visit to saudi 
arabia that destroying saddams military might is his prime 
objective 
he told us troops thursday that their mission was marked by a 
real sense of urgency because of iraqs drive to achieve 
nuclear weapons capability if that development were left 
unchecked saddam would remain a great threat bush said 
if saddam goes there is the danger of a clash between the 
opposition groups whose fractiousness has stopped them from 
challenging saddams totalitarian rule 
some fear that the kurds who have been battling baghdad for 
decades for an autonomous homeland would seek to establish an 
independent state in iraqs mountainous north 
zebari said however wed have a genuine interest in 
maintaining peace in the region and establish a genuine 
democratic government 
the islamic groups face the specter of irans late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini his exhortations to iraqs shiite moslem 
majority during the 198088 war to rise up against saddam did not 
work 
but suspicions linger that if saddam were toppled the shiites 
some 55 percent of iraqs 16 million people might try to create an 
iranianstyle islamic republic in iraq

carol schaljo says shes so healthy 
its ridiculous thats why her inability to get medical 
insurance puzzled her 
she wonders whether her work with aids volunteers of cincinnati 
was the reason 
the irony of this is im a health educator said ms 
schaljo 51 i educate the general community in the 
prevention of coming in contact with and being infected by the hiv 
virus 
throughout the nation medical professionals and volunteers who 
work with people who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or 
carry the hiv virus are finding that along with the satisfaction of 
serving those in need they can face the animosity encountered by 
their patients 
i expect it a lot of times said katharine whisnant a 
social worker with an atlanta aids group whose relationship with a 
boyfriend ended because he could not accept her work with aids 
patients or her homosexual friends 
she said the experience has made her reluctant to tell people 
where she works or what she does at a recent party she tried to 
avoid the issue 
i thought oh i dont want to deal with it so i just said i 
was a social worker 
carol lynne yarletts of the columbus health department tackles 
negative reactions to her occupation headon 
i figure i can either blow people away and tell them what i 
do or i can avoid the issue and say i am a nurse she said 
but my attitude is that for every one person you educate and give 
them the facts that could be five more people that they in turn 
educate or correct their misunderstanding 
public fear toward people who work with aids patients has eased 
as general knowledge of the disease which cannot be spread through 
casual contact has grown since the early 1980s aids workers say 
the growing awareness also has resulted in more volunteers 
becoming interested in aidsrelated work 
hospitals and other organizations that provide services to 
people with the aids initially got as volunteers young homosexual 
white males who had lost someone to aids 
volunteer coordinators say that as the disease affected other 
segments of the community the people offering their services 
became more diverse 
people really have been falling all over themselves to become 
part of the project said dennis davis of the jerusalem house in 
atlanta which is home to five aids patients who otherwise would be 
homeless 
we see gay males and straights young old black and white 
its a very diverse group davis said 
the challenge is getting the right people for the right 
jobs said giulia norton of the aids action committee in boston 
its hard to get people who have the right skills or can work 
during the day when we need them most 
volunteers and medical professionals agree their work with aids 
patients is stressful because of the inevitable that their 
patients will eventually die 
no one has ever been cured of aids which attacks the bodys 
immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of 
infections and cancers 
in the back of their minds too is the fear they will contract 
the disease through an accident 
however the federal centers for disease control in atlanta 
knows of just 37 cases of the virus being transmitted to workers 
in all the cdc says there have been 154917 cases reported in the 
united states as of oct 31 and 95774 people have died 
the virus may be passed along when hivinfected blood or 
contaminated body fluids come into contact with an open wound or is 
injected into the skin according to the cdc 
in a june 1989 report the cdc said a person faces one chance in 
200 of being infected by the hiv virus as a result of a single 
contaminated needle puncture no information was available on the 
likelihood of infection after numerous needle injuries the report 
said 
despite the daytoday pressures aids workers say their 
experiences have enriched their lives 
its hard work its depressing and painful but what you get 
back its tenfold ms whisnant said 
i have turned down several jobs because i want to stay in this 
job said rick gower an aids research associate at ohio state 
university the reward is in being someone on the front line of 
aids research this job goes way beyond the monetary rewards 
i want to be working in this job when a cure for the disease 
comes around i come up with the same kind of hope that the 
patients do

germany is ready to establish an 
airlift to help transport food and other emergency supplies to the 
soviet union a newspaper reported saturday 
the welt am sonntag newspaper quoting unidentified reliable 
sources in bonn said german air force transport planes would be 
used if an airlift became necessary 
the newspaper said government circles think us air force 
units stationed in germany also could take part in a possible 
airlift 
the government is thinking about an operation similar to the 
allied airlift that brought tons of supplies to berlin during the 
soviet blockade of the city from june 1948 to may 1949 the sunday 
newspaper said in a report that was distributed to other news media 
in advance 
there have been dire predictions of what the winter holds in 
store for the soviet people and fears that food shortages could 
seriously exacerbate longstanding tensions and result in civil 
unrest 
dieter vogel a government spokesman said friday that food 
shipments and other aid to moscow this year were absolutely 
essential 
the german view contrasted sharply with a us assessment that 
immediate food aid to the soviet union was unnecessary this year 
germany is sending a team of experts to moscow next week to work 
on resolving expected shortages 
welt am sonntag said germany was preparing the largest 
government and private aid campaign since the end of world war ii 
to help the soviets avert hunger this winter 
much of the aid is expected to come from emergency reserves of 
food and other supplies built up in berlin over the years to help 
the city overcome another possible cold war blockade the newspaper 
said 
chancellor helmut kohl and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
agreed during gorbachevs visit to germany earlier this month to 
jointly sponsor the aid action 
gorbachev is very popular among germans for having made 
unification possible and several private relief agencies have 
already started collecting food and other supplies to be sent to 
the soviet union 
care germany said saturday it is preparing packages of food 
that will be sent to the soviet union before christmas 
a poll published by the wickert institute on saturday said 894 
percent of germans were ready to make personal contributions to the 
relief effort 
kohl has made help to the soviet union a major theme in recent 
speeches and meetings with world leaders particularly at this 
weeks 34nation conference on security and cooperation in europe 
welt am sonntag said kohl will also raise the issue at the 
european economic community summit in december in rome 
kohl is facing national elections next sunday and aid to the 
soviet union has become one of the themes in the campaign 
such aid is a chance to establish and strengthen friendships 
a friend in need is the best friend kohls chief of staff 
rudolf seiters was quoted as saying in welt am sonntag 
this is also help for ourselvesif the soviet union is 
steering in the direction of democracy and market economy then it 
is a development that will benefit everyone in europe 
bonn has already promised 195 billion in various forms of aid 
to the soviet union since gorbachev lifted his objections to german 
unification this summer

the district of columbia has registered its 
third consecutive annual homicide record even though police say a 
major contributing factor the percentage of drugrelated killings 
is declining 
the deaths of a 17yearold student and two others friday 
boosted to 436 the number of killings in the nations capital this 
year that is two more than in 1989 
police chief isaac fulwood jr who has vowed to resign if the 
murder rate doesnt come down said his officers cant win the 
battle alone 
the community is still not angry enough about death and 
violence on the streets of washington dc we have to get a lot 
more angry about young people being killed fulwood said 
after dropping from 200 murders in 1980 to 148 murders in 1985 
the number of homicides in the district soared to a record 372 
murders in 1988 and 434 last year 
police say there actually were 438 killings last year but four 
were listed as justifiable homicides the number of justifiable 
homicides has not been determined for this year 
on a percapita basis washington has led the nation in murders 
the citys image as a drug and murder capital was blamed for a 
decline in tourism in 1989 mayor marion barrys drug arrest and 
conviction this year focused even more attention on the drug 
problem 
police blamed the increased murder rate on an influx of crack 
cocaine into the region in the mid1980s but statistics now 
indicate that drugs are responsible for fewer killings than in 
previous years 
the proportion of slayings classified as drugrelated has fallen 
from 66 percent in 1988 to 52 percent last year to 39 percent this 
year according to police crime reports 
even so drugs remain the single leading cause of murder in the 
nations capital 
wed like to stop these damned murders said police 
spokesman lt reginald smith said but arrests alone are not the 
only answer the thing is to persuade people not to get involved in 
drugs not to fall to social ills that we have seen over the 
years 
smith said a sharp increase in domestic violence was helping 
escalate the murder rate 
in 1986 police believed they would stop the citys drug and 
homicide problem by arresting as many people as possible but after 
a special antidrug program made more than 46000 arrests the 
citys jails are bulging on the streets new drug peddlers step 
forward to take the place of those who go to jail 
since 1985 weve arrested a number of people but the problem 
still persists smith said 
the thing that is driving drug crime in dc is the sale and 
distribution of drugs said richard bennett a professor of 
justice at american university police can have very little 
effect on that as long as there is supply and demand 
police are trying to beef up their presence in drugravaged 
neighborhoods with a return to the traditional walkthebeat 
strategy a rapid deployment unit also has been created to send as 
many as 100 officers into these neighborhoods 
bennett believes results from the new program may be slow in 
coming 
if a chief of police says he will stop homicides in the next 
quarter he is telling a lie bennett said we can have an 
impact on drugs but it will take a long time 
and as in the past most of the victims and the assailants are 
young black men ages 18 to 25 
the victim looks very much like the offender young and 
minority bennett said 
the police departments rapid deployment plan may be in for a 
severe immediate test 
statistics reveal that most of the homicides in the past four 
years occurred in the final three months of the year officials 
said

and spec michael w pierce 27 of rogers ark 
some crew members said they were using night vision goggles for 
the first time during the exercise 
the use of the goggles which electronically enhance moonlight 
has come under fire in recent years because some pilots say they 
limit peripheral vision and cause other problems the army says it 
has improved the goggles after they were blamed for a 1988 crash at 
fort campbell ky that killed 17 soldiers

a natural gas line was ruptured early saturday 
by a barge trying to dock in a waterway known as the arthur kill 
raising fears of an explosion off staten island before winds 
dispersed the gas authorities said 
the barge owned by the bouchard company was being pushed by a 
tugboat into a staten island terminal when its rudder hooked the 
pipe in about 25 feet of water said coast guard spokesman petty 
officer howard holmes 
the broken 16inch main sent an unknown amount of gas into the 
air about 50 feet off the shoreline creating the possibility of an 
explosion said holmes the city fire department was called in case 
of a fire caused by the leak he said 
but the line was tuned off and stiff winds dispersed the gas 
without incident authorities said the rupture did force a 
shutdown of a section of the arthur kill for 7 hours holmes said 
there were no injuries or evacuations authorities said 
the pipe is owned by the texas eastern corp there was no answer 
saturday at the companys offices in new jersey or staten island 
the coast guard is investigating the leak but has not determined 
if anyone is to blame the leak was too minor to affect the 
environment said steven whinham a coast guard marine science 
technician 
the arthur kill a major route for barge and ship traffic in a 
heavily industrialized area has been the site of several major oil 
spills this year

major indian news organizations stopped 
referring to sikh extremists as terrorists this week after the 
militants issued death threats against journalists 
a statement signed by the panthic committee a fiveman group 
guiding the sikh militant movement in punjab said journalists 
would meet memorable punishment if they continued to use the 
word terrorists while writing about the sikh secessionist 
campaign 
consequences of violation could be death the statement 
said according to excerpts carried by press trust of india and the 
hindustan times any death sentence can be appealed to the 
committee the statement added 
sikh radicals have killed an average of 16 people a day in 
punjab in the last two weeks in ambushes bombings and massacres of 
passengers pulled off buses according to police officials more 
than 2930 people have been killed by the extremists so far this 
year in punjab a prosperous farming state on the pakistani border 
the warning to journalists was contained in what the committee 
called a code of conduct for reporting on punjab the code 
takes effect dec 1 according to the sixpage statement received 
wednesday by indian newspaper and news agency offices in 
chandigarh the capital of punjab state 
for the next three days militant gradually replaced 
terrorist in major indian dailies including the hindustan 
times the times of india the statesman and indian express 
similarly the two national news agencies did not mention 
terrorists saturday in stories about a dozen punjab killings 
that police attributed to sikh militants 
for years press trust of india and united news of india like 
most indian newspapers seldom used any word except terrorists 
in their stories about the daily killings in punjab similarly 
punjab police were said to have arrested or shot dead in an 
encounter terrorists or dreaded ultras 
reporters for foreign news organizations generally have referred 
to sikh separatists radicals extremists or militants 
three top indian news executives said saturday their 
organizations had not made any policy decision to comply with the 
panthic committees code they said the choice of words was up 
to the correspondents on the scene 
if they send it in as militants our copy desks would let 
it go the same if they send it in as terrorists one 
executive said like the others he asked not be be identified 
further 
journalists in punjabs two biggest cities chandigarh and 
amritsar said they had been warned by sikh militants to stop using 
the word terrorist the journalists who requested anonymity 
out of fear for their safety said the warnings started about a 
week ago and usually came by telephone 
however police officials were still talking about 
terrorists when they briefed reporters on a bomb attack that 
killed five policemen saturday 
the panthic committees warning against the continued use of 
terrorists was the first time such a demand has been made by 
sikh extremists in their 8yearold separatist campaign 
but they have often accused indian news media of unfair 
reporting on the movement to set up an independent sikh nation 
called khalistan or land of the pure at least 33 journalists and 
62 newspaper vendors have been killed by the extremists since 1982 
the top five leaders of the panthic committee are wanted by 
police for sedition the committee controls the five major militant 
groups in punjab 
sikhs whose faith has roots in both islam and hinduism have a 
slight majority over hindus in punjab nationwide they comprise 2 
percent of indias 880 million people while hindus constitute 82 
percent 
sikh separatists have long complained of cultural political and 
economic discrimination by indias officially secular but 
hindudominated government

of residents a man was in custody on suspicion of arson 
more than 200 firefighters were battling the blaze that began 
shortly after 2 am in a home west of us highway 36 it spread 
as 60 mph winds fanned the flames and destroyed 2400 acres by 
midmorning authorities said 
no major injuries were reported some firefighters reportedly

the african national congress 
and a rival opposition group the pan africanist congress should 
work together to force the end of apartheid and a new constitution 
a pac leader said saturday 
a de facto alliance by the two groups would reverse decades of 
rivalry within the black movement opposed to apartheid south 
africas system of racial segregation and white dominance 
clarence makwetu recently named acting head of the militant pac 
ater the death of its president zeph mothopeng made the 
statement a day after a similar call by anc leader nelson mandela 
mandela is scheduled to meet tuesday with president fw de 
klerk to discuss planned negotiations on ending apartheid and 
giving political power to the black majority 
the meeting comes amid building tension between the anc the 
largest opposition group and the whiteled government the two 
sides have held peace talks since may aimed at removing obstacles 
to the constitutional negotiations planned for next year 
but the government recently has condemned the ancs campaign of 
protests and strikes against apartheid as a form of violent 
rebellion 
mandela has called for increased protests to pressure the 
government to continue its reforms he said south african blacks 
prohibited by law from voting in national elections must use mass 
action to express their grievances 
on friday mandela said he would demand election of a special 
assembly to write a new constitution and formation of an interim 
government to help ease the transition to a nonracial political 
system 
the government has rejected similar calls by other 
antiapartheid leaders saying it must remain intact to maintain 
stability while negotiations take place 
mandelas demands indicate a hardening of the ancs negotiating 
position he also questioned de klerks willingness to proceed with 
negotiations and called for black opposition groups such as the 
anc and pac to band together in seeking change 
he said the pacs choice of makwetu as acting leader gave him 
hope for unity the two men spent 10 years together as prisoners on 
robben island 
makwetu speaking at an african trade summit in swaziland said 
saturday he agreed with mandela that their organizations should 
work together to oppose the government 
he said he would work to unite various opposition groups so that 
we can confront de klerk with a demand for a constituent 
assembly 
de klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate a new 
constitution but also has called for protection of minority 
rights 
the anc calls for a nonracial political system with equal 
voting rights for all citizens 
the pac has traditionally been more militant than the anc and 
some other antiapartheid organizations it was formed by anc 
members who split from the group more than three decades ago and 
believes blacks must struggle for their freedom and find dignity in 
the process rather than gaining equality through white concession 
or compromise 
black leaders have previously called for unity in opposing the 
government but longtime rivalries and ideological differences have 
divided the opposition movement 
the anc and the conservative zulubased inkatha freedom party 
have waged virtual warfare for five years in natal province 
leaving 5000 people dead the fighting spilled over to black 
townships near johannesburg in august killing more than 800 
people 
neither mandela nor makwetu mentioned inkatha in their comments

despite a controversial projection about a 
massive midwest earthquake some residents along the new madrid 
fault are more worried about getting knocked down by a tv truck 
than a temblor in early december 
weve got reporters running out our ears new madrid police 
chief jim helms said theyve been here from washington 
michigan kansas city oklahoma and as far south as houston texas 
weve had them every day 
new madrid a town of about 3300 in southeastern missouri has 
become earthquake central for much of the media zeroing in on iben 
brownings projection and the accompanying anxiety in the region 
browning is the new mexico scientistbusiness consultant who 
says his research shows conditions will be right for a major 
earthquake along the new madrid fault on or about dec 3 he has 
projected a 5050 chance 
he based his projections on tidal forces which will be 
particularly strong at that time most scientists discount his 
tidal theory but say that eventually there will be a powerful 
earthquake along the fault 
brownings projection nevertheless has led school officials in 
at least four states to call off classes it also has renewed 
attention to earthquake preparedness in a region that experiences 
several hundred minor to notevenfelt tremors a year 
the new madrid fault zone runs roughly from marked tree in 
northeast arkansas across the missouri bootheel and up to near 
cairo in southern illinois its named for new madrid which was 
destroyed by a series of strong quakes in the early 1800s that were 
felt all the way to the east coast 
since reports of brownings work came to light earlier this 
year the media have focused increasing attention on the new madrid 
fault zone 
television stations from throughout the region have done 
ratingsmonth series on the projection the fault zone and 
earthquake preparedness reporters have descended from detroit 
minneapolis baltimore and tampa fla people magazine and the 
television program unsolved mysteries also have been to town 
although new madrid residents have become used to being 
interviewed the town is bracing for monday dec 3 when the 
reporters photographers engineers and producers are expected back 
en masse helms said three blocks may be roped off to accommodate 
the television satellite trucks that will roll into town 
rumors are flying dan rather will be here willard scott is 
coming motel rooms have been snatched up interviews arranged 
mayor dick phillips is understanding hell have to work as 
usual at phillips fertilizer co on dec 3 and then conduct a city 
council meeting that evening but hell also try to be available 
for interviews 
the situation puts the news media in an interesting predicament 
is the possibility of an earthquake discounted by most experts 
a story do you send a reporter just in case or do you ignore it 
and hope you dont miss what could be the regions biggest story of 
the year 
editors across the country are deciding 
were going mainly expecting nothing to happen said susan 
okie acting science editor at the washington post this is a 
story because of the excitement its generated 
the feeling is the same at the baltimore sun said national 
editor ed goodpaster 
its like any other prediction there are those that you 
really have to pay attention to to see whether anything does 
happen goodpaster said if it does happen youre in a good 
position to report on it and if it doesnt happen its a good 
story too 
at least one of the major television networks is planning to 
send a national correspondent dozens of network affiliates will be 
on hand others will be stationed in memphis the closest big city 
to the fault zone 
were approaching this as a news event in itself the concern 
that this prediction has caused said john paxson a producer for 
cbs news who will be traveling from dallas while most experts 
kind of sniff at the idea that this man can predict earthquakes 
the prediction is there and a lot of people are very worried about 
it 
the associated press will be there cable news network is 
planning live coverage nbc is still deciding whether to send a 
correspondent or rely on affiliates 
abc news has made the decision not to go 
if there is a quake well go said bob crawford assignment 
manager for abcs midwest bureau in st louis but were not 
planning to go anywhere to wait 
reporters wont be the only ones traveling to new madrid two 
st louis rock n roll radio stations have arranged to broadcast 
their morning shows live one from the new madrid historical 
museum the other from the shake rattle and roll party that is 
planned at a nearby tavern

poland seeking a leader who will hold the 
country together as it pursues democracy and a market economy 
picks its first popularly elected president sunday in a contest 
that has split solidarity 
the last preelection poll showed solidarity chairman lech 
walesa comfortably leading the field of six with his former ally 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the closest challenger 
but it appeared there will be a runoff vote on dec 9 because no 
candidate had more than 50 percent of the vote according to the 
state television poll taken monday and tuesday 
the campaign officially ended at noon friday by order of the 
national election commission officials were told to be on the 
lookout for illegal electioneering saturday including hanging 
posters or distributing leaflets 
poles living abroad began casting ballots saturday one day 
early so as not to delay the final count voting was taking place 
in the united states canada argentina brazil uruguay and 
venezuela and aboard polish ships in the pacific 
the balloting in poland was to begin at 6 am sunday and end at 
8 pm about twothirds of the nations more than 27 million voters 
were expected to cast ballots first partial results were expected 
late sunday 
the television poll with an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percent gave walesa 38 percent of the votes mazowiecki 23 percent 
and stanislaw tyminski 17 percent 13 percent went to three minor 
candidates and 9 percent were undecided 
tyminskis support appeared to be slipping however the emigre 
businessman returned after 21 years in peru and canada to mount a 
freespending campaign based on his claimed economic expertise 
he shocked mazowieckis supporters by outpolling the prime 
minister in one survey but since then tyminski has faced a 
barrage of criticism in the press one commentator said poland 
would be a laughing stock if it elected him 
if he wins i will emigrate walesa declared on thursday 
the other candidates are roman bartoszcze of the polish 
peasants party former communist wlodzimierz cimoszewicz endorsed 
by the social democracy party and leszek moczulski head of the 
patrioticnationalist confederation for an independent poland 
president wojciech jaruzelski the communist general who ordered 
martial law to crush solidarity and imprisoned walesa and 
mazowiecki in december 1981 is expected to hand over the office to 
the winner before christmas 
at that time the stillexisting world war ii 
governmentinexile in london is expected to present the symbols of 
authority from the prewar second polish rpublic the london exiles 
never recognized the sovietsponsored state created in poland after 
the war 
walesa proposed mazowiecki as eastern europes first 
noncommunist prime minister in august 1989 but he and his close 
adviser of nearly a decade fell out in a bitter dispute this year 
that split solidarity 
last spring walesa began attacking the government accusing it 
of moving too slowly in reforming the economy and of not removing 
enough holdover communists from powerful positions 
the mazowiecki camp answered that walesa was destabilizing 
poland at a critical time because of personal ambitions and a 
feeling of resentment that he was on the political sidelines 
mazowiecki supporters including most of the old solidarity 
elite say the prime minister will overtake walesa in the second 
round picking up votes from other candidates 
at walesa headquarters in gdansk last week supporters were 
still talking about a firstround victory walesa has called for a 
broad mandate because of polands economic problems 
walesa planned to spend sunday at home in gdansk after voting in 
the morning and attending mass he was to watch returns on 
television at his headquarters in the evening 
mazowiecki had similar plans tyminski would not say what his 
plans were 
the first task of the new president will be to nominate a prime 
minister because mazowiecki will have to give up the office if he 
wins and has said he will resign if he loses walesa has said he 
has five candidates in mind 
both mazowiecki and walesa are believed to have deputy prime 
minister leszek balcerowicz the architect of polands yearlong 
radical economic reform program high on their lists for prime 
minister 
the president has a fiveyear term and can be reelected once 
the president is head of state and commander in chief of the 
military responsible for internal and external security he 
nominates the prime minister when a government falls has limited 
veto power over legislation and can dissolve parliament or declare 
a state of emergency under strictly defined circumstances 
but the powers would be redefined and possibly strengthened in a 
new constitution expected in 1991

voters in czechoslovakia cast 
their final ballots for newly structured local governments saturday 
in an election that marked another step toward democracy 
in southern slovakia where balloting had begun friday the 
election was also expected to measure the strength of separatist 
sentiment voting in the czech republic was held only saturday 
under the previous communist system towns villages and city 
districts were run by national committees that were controlled by 
the communist party but as of saturday the committees will be 
replaced by westernstyle municipal councils 
as he cast his ballot premier marian calfa said he hoped the 
elections would help break local mafias of the past system 
nationwide 97 parties fielded more than 232000 candidates 
disputing 100000 municipal and village council seats slovaks also 
chose mayors directly in the czech lands elected councils were to 
pick mayors 
polls closed at 2 pm 8 am est in slovakia and at 8 pm 2 
pm est in the czech lands final results were not expected 
before late sunday 
no party fielded candidates in every constituency although the 
communist party ran the most in about 19 percent of the districts 
nationwide 
in slovakia where there has been strident nationalist agitation 
for secession since the collapse of communism a year ago balloting 
took on a special significance 
the slovak nationalist party the largest of the political 
groups favoring a separate slovakia had candidates in only 4 
percent of the 5687 slovak electoral districts but party 
officials predicted their candidates would gain more than 20 
percent of the vote where they competed 
the nationalists are the fourthstrongest party in the slovak 
parliament with 13 percent of seats a strong showing in the 
municipal vote would strengthen their hand 
conversely a good performance by candidates of the slovak 
government coalition of public against violence the christian 
democrats and the democratic party would bolster efforts to keep 
czechoslovakia united 
the last preelection poll indicated public against violence 
would win in about 29 percent of districts they were contesting 
followed by the christian democrats with 27 percent and the 
nationalists with 17 percent 
in the czech lands of bohemia and moravia civic forum the 
loose democratic coalition founded by president vaclav havel was a 
clear favorite but there is no issue in the czech region as 
divisive as separation 
peter tatar a founding member of public against violence said 
that in slovakia the issue of selfdetermination was more important 
than any other 
this is not a balanced society he said saturday with 
insecurities about the future many people have begun to seek 
something they can identifiy with national identity 
in bratislava the slovak capital several people interviewed at 
polling stations said they had voted for nationalist candidates 
but others said they preferred a unified czechoslovakia 
its better to live together said jozef sivak 38 at a 
bratislava polling station set up in the lenin museum and festooned 
with busts and portraits of the bolshevik leader 
potentially explosive nationalist sentiment in the southern 
republic was kept in check for four decades by communist leaders 
but it bubbled to the surface shortly after street protests swept 
the communists from power in 1989 
while closely related in origins czechs and slovaks developed 
separately for centuries union in 1920 was for many slovaks 
primarily a way to end nearly 1000 years of hungarian domination 
persisting nationalist sentiment opened the way for secession in 
1938 and six years as a nazi puppet state 
reunification in 1944 created a czechdominated federal 
government and an emasculated slovak regional government the 
advent of communist rule in 1948 perpetuated the imbalance

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca has fired 
another salvo in his feud with a japanese politician whom he has 
accused of arrogance and bashing america 
i put shintaro ishihara in the class of to be polite 
reactionaries iacocca said in an interview published in playboy 
magazines january issue everybody has his share of loose 
cannons and hes a loose cannon 
iacoccas latest comments released saturday came in the same 
magazine where in october ishihara called the us auto executive 
irresponsible incompetent dirty dealing 
im not going to call him names iacocca said i could 
call him better names than that theyd be dirty but more 
original 
the feud between the two bluntspeaking men broke out after 
publication in japan of the book the japan that can say no by 
ishihara and sony corp cofounder akio morita ishihara 57 is a 
filmmaker and awardwinning writer as well as a member of the 
japanese parliament 
an unauthorized translation of the book was entered into the 
congressional record by rep sander levin dmich and became a 
target for criticism and of pentagon and congressional scrutiny 
the collection of speeches by ishihara and morita has sold more 
than a million copies in japan but it has been attacked in the 
united states as an example of americabashing 
ishihara told playboy in october that the books unofficial 
translation contains misinterpretations and distortions adding 
i plan to publish an accurate formal version which is now being 
prepared 
at the time iacocca said ishiharas and moritas arrogance 
pours salt into an already open wound 
ishihara said in the interview that iaccoca used japan as a 
scapegoat for his own inadequacies as an industrialist 
last summer iacocca went on a sixcity us tour showing off 
chryslers products and taking swipes at the japanese government 
saying it should abandon its policy of closing the domestic market 
to nonjapanese companies 
its a feeling ishihara shares 
japan should say yes to america and open our market he said 
in the october playboy interview 
ishihara said dropping the barriers would help japanese 
consumers by increasing competition and lowering prices 
iacocca also said japan should open its borders to foreign 
manufacturers as has the united states 
we also have 10 transplants japanese and korean car 
factories that have opened in the us and in canada he said 
every one is loaded like a christmas tree with tax benefits from 
the individual states 
but nobodys ever invited me to do a transplant over in 
japan 
chrysler has a marketing agreement with honda motor co ltd to 
sell its jeep vehicles in japan also chrysler and mitsubishi 
motors corp of japan have a longstanding manufacturing 
relationship 
on other matters in the interview iacocca 
suggested americans should begin borrowing less money we 
should produce more and consume less said iacocca whos been 
paid an average of 115 million annually since 1985 we should 
save more and borrow less 
repeated a call for the bush administration to develop an 
economic policy we need a better organization at the highest 
levels of government to understand what trade and commerce are all 
about he said 
bemoaned the loss of gerald greenwald who quit as chryslers 
vice chairman earlier this year prolonging iacoccas tenure as the 
companys chairman by at least a year greenwald who was iacoccas 
heir apparent left to head what proved to be an unsuccessful 
effort by three unions to buy united airlines

when juliet chengs baby girl was 
diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis she turned to traditional 
chinese remedies to treat the girl acupuncture herbal medicines 
and massage 
but now cheng is running out of time to prove that her faith in 
the medicine of her ancestors isnt misplaced and that her daughter 
wont face the rest of her life crippled because of the treatments 
cheng has already lost temporary custody of her daughter 
shirley now 7 and if the girls condition hasnt radically 
improved by next month a federal judge has granted doctors 
permission to operate on the girl against her mothers wishes 
i have the rights not them cheng said bitterly as she 
waited to visit shirley at newington childrens hospital where the 
girl is now living they cannot force me to do this 
cheng had little exposure to eastern medicine as a girl growing 
up in shanghai her father was a urologist who attended a 
westernstyle medical school he treated her with penicillin and 
other staples of western medicine 
cheng emigrated to the united states a decade ago hoping to go 
to college and become a lawyer she met shirleys father while 
taking college preparatory classes but the two never married and 
she has raised the girl alone 
when shirley was diagnosed with the crippling joint disease as 
an 11monthold infant cheng first turned to an american doctor 
he prescribed aspirin to ease the pain in her swollen joints 
that didnt help cheng said so she treated her daughter at 
home with herbal potions she also took her back to china where 
shirley was treated with acupuncture massage and concoctions made 
from animal glands 
cheng says it was only during those four extended trips to china 
that her daughter showed significant improvement 
i know it works because weve tried it so many times with 
shirley it helps her cheng said 
shirley suffered a relapse after returning from her last trip to 
china about a year ago cheng said a doctor in poughkeepsie ny 
where the two were living with chengs own mother suggested she 
consult a specialist at newington childrens hospital 
doctors there told cheng her daughter would never walk unless 
she had surgery to relieve the tightness in the tendons and 
ligaments around the joints in her hips knees and left ankle 
cheng refused and the hospital persuaded the state department of 
children and youth services to go to court in july to take 
temporary custody 
the two sides were back in court in october when us district 
judge t emmet clarie gave cheng until dec 5 to demonstrate that 
nonwestern treatment could help her daughter 
the us supreme court addressed a similar issue earlier this 
year in fresno calif the laotian immigrant parents of a 
6yearold boy born with clubfeet opposed courtordered corrective 
surgery because they believed spirits inflicted the defect to 
punish the family 
in june the supreme court refused to overturn lower court 
rulings that ordered corrective surgery for the boy kou xiong but 
hospitals have refused to perform the operations without consent 
from his parents ger and houa vue xiong 
when cheng couldnt find a traditional chinese practitioner who 
was also a licensed medical doctor as required by claries order 
she chose what she saw as the next best thing a homeopathic 
doctor 
homeopathy is a westernbased alternative medicine that is 
popular in the orient because it relies on similar philosophical 
principles its practitioners use small doses of natural medicines 
to strengthen the bodys healing powers 
shirley is now receiving diluted doses of phosphorous and poison 
ivy to relieve the swelling in her joints and improve her appetite 
she also visits a physical therapist three times a week for 
twohour sessions that sometimes try the little girls patience on 
a recent visit the usually happy girl wriggled around the therapy 
table and complained i want to go home 
dr william shevin the homeopathic doctor who is treating 
shirley believes she could be cured and able to walk within two or 
three years if she continues the current treatment 
shirleys physical therapist said the girl has shown slight 
improvement during the homeopathic treatment but doctors at 
newington believe she has gotten worse said thomas hanley a 
hospital spokesman 
dr sherwin nuland an associate professor of surgery at yale 
medical school who has studied both western and chinese medicine 
said chinese treatment is effective in the early stages of 
rheumatoid arthritis but once there is anatomical damage surgery 
is the only answer he said 
she will be crippled for the rest of her life without 
surgery he said 
thomas moriarty a spokesman for the state department of 
children and youth services defended the agencys decision to 
intervene 
although this case has undertones of cultural and 
philosophical differences we have to rely on what our doctors tell 
us moriarty said the bottom line is we have to protect 
children

a group of british women on saturday won 
the release of relatives held in iraqs socalled human shield and 
saddam hussein promised a catholic priest that he would free a 
large number of italians 
baghdads official media announced the planned releases but did 
not say when the hostages would be allowed to leave 
greece said 10 hostages would be released sunday the iraqi 
embassy in athens said saddam ordered the release in response to an 
appeal by representatives of the greekiraqi friendship 
association currently visiting baghdad 
a german foreign ministery spokesman said german hostages freed 
by iraq also were expected to return home on sunday afternoon 
the spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said there 
were about 170 germans left in iraq and in kuwait iraq has said 
that all german hostages would be allowed to leave but the 
spokesman said he did not know how many would be on sundays 
flight 
hundreds of foreigners have been held in iraq since the invasion 
of kuwait in august some have been freed in return for shipments 
of food and medicines and others in an attempt to gain favor and 
divide the international coalition opposed to the invasion 
saddam met for one hour with the 10 british women who flew to 
baghdad last week seeking the release of their husbands despite 
advice from the british government against the trip 
iraqi state television quoted saddam as telling the women 
preventing british nationals from leaving is not our wish but is 
one of the means to avert a bigger catastrophe 
it did not say how many britons would be allowed to leave but 
that all of them are guests of the iraqi people 
that indicated the men are among more than 400 britons held at 
strategic sites as human shields against a potential military 
attack iraq calls these hostages guests they also include 200 
other foreigners mainly americans and japanese 
in addition to the britons held at about 30 installations in 
iraq and occupied kuwait about 700 britons also are banned from 
traveling 
iraq imposed the ban in response to the usled multinational 
military buildup in the region saddam said the foreigners 
presence would help avert a military confrontation over iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
earlier the official iraqi news agency reported that he met 
with catholic archbishop hilarion capucci and promised to free a 
large number of italian nationals there are 270 italians trapped 
in iraq and occupied kuwait 
the agency said saddam was allowing the italians to leave in 
appreciation of capuccis mission 
the report followed the arrival in baghdad on saturday of an 
alitalia jetliner carrying 25 tons of medical supplies capucci was 
at baghdad airport to receive the shipment the television 
reported 
capucci is the spiritual head of the 3000member melchiterite 
catholic community of jerusalem arab christians who have formed an 
easternright branch of the roman catholic church the melchite 
catholics recognize the primacy of the pope but have broad 
independence from the vatican 
the syrianborn capucci was jailed for nearly three years by the 
israelis on charges of smuggling arms to palestinian guerrillas he 
was released and deported in 1977 after an appeal by pope paul vi 
he has since been living in rome 
a finnish delegation arrived in baghdad saturday to try to win 
freedom for finnish hostages that nations radio reported 
two former government ministers paavo vayrynen and ulf 
sundqvist traveled with mikko lohikoski the vice chairman of the 
finnisharab friendship society 
a finnish red cross physician also made the trip to assess the 
need for emergency aid for iraqi children

several youths have been arrested in 
connection with a series of mysterious slayings in baghdad 
elementary schools that began after iraqs invasion of kuwait 
diplomatic sources said saturday 
the official media denied there have been any killings but 
reported that 22 youths including two girls were arrested for 
reckless behavior it was not immediately clear when the 
arrests were made 
the iraqi news agency carried a statement from the ministry of 
the interior saying the youths had spread fear in elementary 
schools it said they had distributed pamphlets written on school 
walls and made telephone calls aimed at creating chaos 
diplomatic sources reached by telephone said several baghdad 
school children had been found slain their bodies repeatedly 
slashed in the toilets of their schools in the iraqi capital 
the diplomats said in one school a slogan written in red said 
iraqi children were being killed to avenge the killing of the 
children of kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 and annexed six 
days later 
diplomats said the killings have occurred in the almost four 
months since iraqs invasion of the emirate but gave no specific 
dates 
later saturday state television broadcast confessions from some 
of the detainees but none reported committing any action as 
dramatic as the diplomatic reports 
reports of murders are fabricated rumors and lies the 
television announcer said 
the children admitted that they wrote slogans on the walls sent 
notes to their classmates frightening them on behalf of a 
fictitious group that they called the black hand gang 
i wrote on the wall of my school it is your turn zaid 
said one youth who identified himself as issam abdulzahra he did 
not explain what he meant by that or provide the full name of the 
classmate he targetted for what he called a joke 
news reports said interior minister samer mohammed abdel wahab 
met in an emergency session with baghdad police friday to discuss 
the situation in elementary schools 
the minister was quoted as telling police to redouble their 
efforts to encounter those who dare to violate the security and 
stability of the internal front at a time when iraq is engaged in 
battle with the evil enemy 
his comments and the ministry statement indicated that iraqi 
authorities feared some groups within iraq might be trying to stir 
domestic unrest while the government focuses on its confrontation 
over kuwait with usled forces

the white house will file a formal protest 
this week with the swiss government over a scuffle and shouting 
match that occurred between members of president bushs delegation 
and swiss security forces at geneva airport 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the security force 
treatment brutal and vicious but geneva police spokesman 
thierry magnin described the actions of some american reporters as 
deplorable and inadmissible 
fitzwater said a formal protest would be lodged with swiss 
ambassador edouard brunner after bush returns from mexico 
no one was available at the swiss embassy in washington on 
saturday to comment 
the incidents took place friday while bush was en route back to 
the united states following an eightday visit to europe and the 
middle east 
on bushs arrival at the airport in geneva security officers 
clashed with newsmen and photographers in the presidents party 
the press people were pushed and shoved as they sought to approach 
the ramp on which bush would leave the plane 
fitzwater said us chief of protocol joseph reed was poked in 
the abdomen with a machine gun and jerome delay a 
washingtonbased photographer with the french news agency agence 
francepress was roughed up afp in washington said delay was not 
injured 
swiss foreign ministry spokeswoman andrea reichlin said geneva 
police were unaware that traveling white house reporters are 
usually allowed under air force ones left wing to watch the 
president come and go 
but reporters traveling with bush quoted a white house official 
as saying swiss police announced without explanation shortly before 
bushs arrival that they would bar reporters from that position 
ive never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a 
security force in the last 10 years fitzwater said 
in another incident fitzwater said white house chief of staff 
jon sununu was verbally attacked when he complained about the 
earlier occurrences 
but magnin in a telephone interview saturday said american 
reporters did not respect security measures taken by geneva 
police or swiss territorial sovereignty 
there certainly was a row and heated words but this was to 
enforce security measures taken in accord with the american 
security services magnin said 
magnin said he could not comment on the machine gun incident 
but if it happened the submachine gun certainly was not 
pointed at the diplomat he added 
he said reed may have been mistaken for a nondiplomat because 
it was dark and he was wearing a trench coat that may have obscured 
his identifying badge 
he said the police were simply doing their job and noted they 
have long experience with dignitaries coming through geneva 
we dont expect to apologize because we think we acted 
properly to maintain security magnin said

authorities he became addicted to pain killers following surgery 
has been fired for making bomb threats to pharmacies so he could 
steal drugs when the stores were evacuated authorities said 
raymond leo novitis was dismissed after admitting telephoning 17 
threats in less than a month to feed his addiction particularly to 
codeinebased lortab hillsborough county sheriffs col cal 
henderson said saturday 
the nineyear veteran was arrested friday on duty and in 
uniform after he walked out of a drug store where he had responded 
to a threat he later admitted making officials said 
a stakeout team was waiting outside the rite aid discount 
pharmacy which received two threats two days apart 
novitis was charged with two counts of making bomb threats and 
remained in jail saturday on 20000 ond each charge carries a 
possible 15year prison sentence 
the 40yearold deputy told detectives he became addicted 
following an appendectomy in july after being successfully treated 
three years ago for a prior addiction while he recovered from the 
surgery he had been assigned to light duty until oct 20 the 
threats to pharmacies in his brandon patrol area began oct 31 
henderson said 
he was very remorseful its a sad situation henderson 
said 
detectives had been secretly watching novitis since last week 
when they noticed the bomb threats were at stores in his patrol 
zone and that novitis would respond and sign all of the incident 
reports henderson said 
also one pharmacist told investigators he recognized novitis 
voice from an earlier threat 
on friday detectives watched novitis telephone the rite aid 
from a pay phone about a mile away records show a tap on the drug 
store telephone also traced the call to the telephone booth 
when the call was dispatched novitis volunteered to respond 
detectives closed in after he evacuated the store and was leaving 
novitis also admitted making a bomb threat to the same store 
wednesday 
although novitis has admitted stealing 200300 prescription pain 
killers over the past weeks no drug charges were brought against 
him because authorities couldnt pinpoint specific thefts 
novitis did not have any drugs with him or in his patrol car 
when undercover detectives converged on him outside the pharmacy 
he said he didnt steal drugs from every store according to 
henderson sometimes the pharmacist wouldnt let him have access 
to the drug area and other times there were too many other 
deputies around 
henderson said none of the pharmacies had noticed or reported 
any prescription pills missing 
sheriffs investigators will discuss the case with prosecutors 
next week henderson said 
novitis who has a wife and three children was treated in 1987 
for addiction to the pain killer percodan henderson said 
he successfully completed a 28day treatment program and was 
randomly tested for drugs but no tests had been done since he 
returned to work in october henderson said

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday offered 
the 15 soviet republics a treaty giving them control over virtually 
all affairs except defense but his draft was dead on arrival in 
nearly half the republics 
the longawaited draft union treaty published in major 
newspapers is gorbachevs attempt to stop the rapid splintering of 
political unity in this huge and diverse country of 285 million 
people 
it is his blueprint for saving a degree of central authority it 
addresses some of the issues behind bloody ethnic conflicts and a 
paralysis of power hindering economic reform and worsening 
shortages of food and consumer goods 
the proposed treaty drafted by gorbachev and other members of 
the federation council would rename the union of soviet socialist 
republics the union of sovereign soviet republics the treaty 
said the union would be voluntary but did not identify who in 
each republic voters or legislators would decide whether to 
join 
each republic as a sovereign state has full state powers 
over its territory treaty participants regard the soviet union as 
a sovereign federative state formed as a result of the republics 
voluntary union the draft says 
the blueprint was sent to the legislatures of the union and the 
15 republics for approval 
it is there that more trouble lies ahead for gorbachev whose 
influence and power over the country is eroding 
not only the baltic states but also many soviet republics 
will not sign this treaty lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis said in a television address to his republic which is 
in the forefront of drives to break from moscow 
at least six republics have already indicated they will not 
sign armenia ukraine georgia estonia latvia and lithuania the 
participation of other republics is in doubt because of drives for 
sovereignty or independence that have swept all but one kirgizia 
instead many republics have been bypassing the kremlin and 
signing treaties with each other governing trade cultural and 
political ties 
according to the draft union treaty the kremlin would continue 
to control defense and borders it would administer jointly with 
republics an economic development program the space program 
transportation and the energy system 
the treaty rebuffs plans by several republics to introduce their 
own currencies to replace the soviet ruble whose value has 
plummeted the draft says the union will join the republics in 
setting monetary policy based on a single currency 
the draft also says the republics will own land and natural 
resources except for those the union needs to exercise its powers 
many republics claim the central government has taken their land 
and resources and used them for wasteful and polluting factories 
the treaty would leave virtually all other issues such as 
management of the economy education and culture to the 
republics in the current system central ministries in moscow 
supervise factories nationwide often in disregard for local 
conditions 
the draft presents a formula for resolving jurisdictional 
disputes that have paralyzed and confused the country for weeks 
especially holding up the transition from a centrally planned to a 
market economy 
in declarations of sovereignty most republics and many regions 
within them have declared local laws supreme over national 
legislation the draft union treaty proclaims the supremacy of 
republic legislation over republics territories on all questions 
except those which are referred to the jurisdiction of the union 
the treaty which would replace a 1922 accord that united the 15 
republics but gave them few powers says nothing about how a 
republic might secede 
the national legislature passed a law in april that requires 
twothirds of a republics voters to approve secession in a 
referendum the republic would have to wait up to five years while 
the terms of secession are negotiated 
gorbachev has maintained the people in the republics want to 
remain in the union and criticized republic legislators for 
separatism 
at a news conference friday gorbachev warned that any attempt 
to break up the soviet union without calling a referendum could 
lead to bloodshed and civil conflict

two sailors one from this western 
michigan city were defeated by mountainous waves off the tip of 
south america in their quest to break a 136yearold sailing 
record a spokeswoman said 
steve pettengill 39 of grand rapids and rick wilson 40 of 
boston left san francisco on oct 22 in wilsons 60foot triamaran 
great american they were attempting to reach boston in less than 
76 days and six hours the record set in 1853 by the cargoladen 
clipper northern light 
but 50foot waves driven by winds up to 80 mph overturned the 
great american off cape horn about 10 am thanksgiving day said 
barbara kalunian who spoke to wilson via a shiptoshore radio 
friday 
wilson said a larger wave righted the craft about an hour later 
the mast was broken into three pieces 
wilson and pettengill had been in the water 31 days and were 
about four days ahead of the record wednesday 
the sailors pelted by hail and freezing rain huddled in the 
swamped craft for 14 hours they were rescued thursday night by the 
900foot container ship new zealand pacific the huge ship nearly 
plowed over the helpless craft before crew members spotted flares 
shot off by wilson and pettengill 
at the end i really couldnt even open my eyes to look at 
the waves it was that frightening wilson told kalunian 
obviously the forces of the sea are very strong 
the voyage was intended in part to raise funds for the american 
lung association which had a 900 telephone number set up where 
interested people could call for a fee and hear progress 
reports on the trip 
wilson said both men were in good condition the new zealand 
pacific was bound for the netherlands where it was scheduled to 
arrive dec 10 the men will go on to the netherlands before making 
the journey back to the us 
the sailors knew foul weather and treacherous seas probably 
would greet them off cape horn where the atlantic and pacific 
oceans collide 
after the boat was overturned the men activated a 
satelliterelayed distress signal designed to alert us coast 
guard and chilean officials 
a rescue plane had spotted the freighter about 100 miles from 
the great american the crew dropped lines overboard which wilson 
and pettengill tied around their waists in a dangerous rescue 
mission in darkness and 3035foot waves wilson and pettengill 
jumped to a rope ladder dangling from the new zealand pacific 
in 1989 pettengill and a canadian sailor successfully rounded 
cape horn from east to west to break by 12 days a 135yearold 
record set by the clipper flying cloud

the commander of the soviet army in germany said 
84 soldiers had deserted in recent months but he denied news 
reports that black market dealing and mysterious deaths were 
rampant among the troops 
it was the first time the soviets have provided figures on the 
number of deserters 
gen boris vasilievich snetkov said 36 soldiers had left the 
army and turned themselves in to german authorities the other 48 
were missing he said 
the 380000 troops stationed in eastern germany are the largest 
contingent of the red army outside the soviet union they are to be 
withdrawn by 1994 
snetkov told a news conference that they face a relatively 
tense situation in the planned pullout from germany over the next 
four years 
but he denied reports that the contingent was falling apart 
plagued by low morale internal fighting and mysterious deaths 
recently german and soviet officials have expressed concern 
about the soviet troops still stationed in germany soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev spoke of an antisoviet flavor 
during his meeting with chancellor helmut kohl in bonn earlier this 
month 
the troops have become a bitter remnant of the cold war 
occupation and many germans are anxious to see them leave the 
soldiers however face an uncertain future at home no guarantee 
of housing and the loss of access to western affluence and material 
goods 
germany has promised 8 billion to the soviet union to help 
finance the withdrawal 
in an interview published saturday in the eastern german daily 
junge welt a soviet lawyer and human rights activist was quoted as 
saying there were 800 deaths among soviet troops in 1988 and that 
he was investigating more than 2000 deaths in mysterious 
circumstances 
oleg liamin also was quoted as saying soviet barracks operate 
under a regime of terror where extortion and beatings among the 
troops are common 
other reports in the german press have said that red army 
soldiers desperate for german marks allegedly raid depots and 
trade weapons and uniforms on the black market 
soviet privates are paid only 16 a month 
snetkov called the reports of black market trade a lie and 
said the reported number of alleged deaths among the troops in 
eastern germany was ten times too high the actual number is 
about 100 a year he said 
we know our stay in this country brings inconveniences to the 
people he said but the people must understand that the forces 
must fulfill their training duties as army of the soviet union 
he said antisoviet sentiment by some germans was only making 
the pullout more difficult 
he said many soviet soldiers have been robbed by germans 
closer contact between the red army and the bundeswehr 
germanys armed force will ease tensions in the coming period he 
said

an early morning fire turned a commercial 
stables into a ruin killing more than 50 show and race horses here 
saturday 
the fire broke out at about 4 am apparently in one of two 
wings that housed the horses fire officials said the cause of the 
blaze was still under investigation and said they had not ruled 
out arson 
scott laffey who leased the sabbath day farm and ran the 
stables said he dashed to the barn from his nearby home when he 
heard a signal from an alarm he blindfolded two horses and shooed 
them out of the barn but only four horses survived 
a horse will run back into the stall laffey said thats 
the problem 
the intense heat razed one wing of the red barn and destroyed 
much of the second wing 
the whole sky over there was just red said kathy clemenzi 
a neighbor who could see the fire from her home it just lit up 
the sky 
it would be like an oven said police chief roger merry 
the charred carcasses of horses lay in rows where their stalls 
had been fire officials and the farms owner marshall jespersen 
spent the morning photographing and identifying the remains laffey 
said he was not sure exactly how many horses died but estimated 
about 55 were killed 
the horses were worth between 5000 and 35000 apiece laffey 
said merry estimated the total loss was worth more than 2 
million 
firefighters had to bring in water tankers and pump water from a 
nearby pond to douse the flames 
laffey said the fire accelerated quickly leading him to wonder 
whether it may have been set no hay was stored in the barn in 
my heart i believe it took off too fast he said merry said 
investigators have not drawn conclusions one way or another on 
whether arson was involved 
horse owners who had lodged and trained their animals at the 
farm came to survey the damage matthew morton said his brother and 
sisterinlaw a new hampshire couple who were housing three horses 
while they were on a trip were heartbroken 
theyd just absolutely fallen in love with those horses 
morton said 
said kathy borylo who trained horses at the farm my 
customers are all devastated

defying international appeals japan launched the 
fourth season of its controversial research whaling program 
saturday with plans to kill up to 330 whales 
environmentalists charge the program is a cover for continued 
commercial whaling 
the mother ship nisshin maru no 3 left saturday for the 
antarctic ocean where it is to be joined by three smaller boats 
for four months of whaling kyodo news service reported 
they officially plan to catch 300 minke whales a relatively 
abundant smaller species the research program allows up to 330 
animals to be killed 
in july japan norway and iceland appealed unsuccessfully at a 
meeting of the international whaling commission for minkes to be 
excluded from the commissions moratorium on commercial whaling 
nobuyuki yagi a fishery agency official said japan hopes 
information about minke populations gathered by the fleet this 
season will encourage the commission to reevaluate the moratorium 
instituted in 1986 after many of the great whale species were 
hunted close to extinction 
japanese officials say whales must be killed during the research 
to accurately determine their age sex childbearing state diet 
and health 
environmentalists say nonlethal research methods are available 
such as skin samplings and sighting studies 
japan officially stopped its commercial whaling at the end of 
the 198687 season when it caught 1941 whales it then began a 
program of research whaling which is permitted under the whaling 
commissions charter 
japanese whalers killed 273 animals in the first year of the 
research program 241 in the second and 330 in the third 
at its meeting this year the commission passed nonbinding 
resolutions questioning whether japans research program was 
scientifically accurate and urging it to use nonlethal methods 
wherever possible officials said 
although japanese whaling officials previously said at least 825 
whales must be caught each year to make the program scientifically 
valid japanese experts recalculated the sampling error in response 
to the iwc resolutions and determined that 300 was sufficient yagi 
said 
japan also appealed at the iwc meeting for permission to hunt 50 
minke whales commercially each year along its coast saying small 
traditional whaling communities had been damaged by the moratorium 
yagi said but that proposal also was rejected 
the minke reaches about 30 feet in length and eight tons in 
weight and is the smallest of the commercially sought great 
whales the commission estimates there are about 760000 minkes in 
the antarctic and about 83000 in the north atlantic 
officials say whaling also is an important part of the japanese 
diet and culture japan is the worlds largest consumer of whale 
meat and whales provided 23 percent of the nations meat when 
japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s 
whale meat is now considered a delicacy because of its limited 
supply

the main christian militia started 
withdrawing its heavy weapons from east beirut on saturday 
removing the last major obstacle to president elias hrawis 
demilitarization of the capital 
the move by the lebanese forces militia was the first phase in 
a 48hour total withdrawal from east beirut a spokesman for the 
militia said 
the pullout began five days after a nov 19 deadline set by 
hrawi in his effort to create a militiafree zone in the socalled 
greater beirut area the pullot is the first phase of an arab 
leaguebrokered peace plan to end lebanons 15yearold civil war 
private militias have been blamed for most of the estimated 
150000 deaths during the fighting and their forces had siphoned 
off taxes from a weakened and divided central government 
the major moslem militias withdrew before the deadline but the 
lebanese forces led by samir geagea refused to leave until rival 
prosyrian christians and other syrianbacked forces returned 
lebanese forces offices they had seized geagea also demanded 
guarantees that the prosyrian forces would not be allowed into 
east beirut after the lebanese forces withdrew 
the prosyrian christian forces are led by geageas bitter 
rival elie hobeika a geagea spokesman who declined to be 
identified said the lebanese forces demands had been met with the 
government ordering the antihobeika fifth brigade of the army to 
police most of east beirut 
militiamen of the 6000strong lebanese forces loaded mortars 
machine guns recoilless cannons and cases of ammunition onto 30 
trucks near their headquarters in the seaside district of 
karantina 
the convoy headed north along the coastal boulevard to kesrouan 
province which lies outside the greater beirut area 
the spokesman said the militia will evacuate some 400 fighters 
40 tanks and 50 armored personnel carriers from beiruts christian 
sector 
government troops will move into metropolitan beiruts 
karantina nabaa and ashrafiyeh districts traditional lebanese 
forces strongholds as our pullout proceeds the spokesman said 
on condition of anonymity 
when the operation was completed monday these districts will 
be in the hands of the lebanese army he said 
the greater beirut zone will cover a 15mile coastal stretch 
from the dog river in the north to the damour river in the south 
and extend east and northeast to encompass part of the christian 
heartland that had been controlled by rebel gen michel aoun 
aoun had defied hrawi for 11 months until the presidents syrian 
allies crushed his mutiny last month 
hrawi hopes to disband the militias and extend longabsent state 
authority over all of lebanon 
but disarming the militias who have long held sway will be a 
formidable task 
another complication is israels occupation of a border strip in 
southern lebanon israel has made clear it will not pull out of its 
selfdeclared security zone while antiisraeli armed factions 
roam freely in southern lebanon

about 30000 demonstrators rallied to 
back embattled premier andrei lukanov on saturday one day after he 
narrowly survived a noconfidence vote government opponents 
blocked a main boulevard in protest 
some fights broke out between government supporters and 
opponents but hundreds of police intervened to prevent serious 
clashes 
lukanov told the crowd saturday that he was no coward and 
accused the opposition of trying to establish a new political 
monopoly lukanov is among a group of former communists who 
toppled longtime ruler todor zhivkov last year and oversaw 
parliamentary elections 
the noconfidence vote friday followed months of wrangling 
between the former communists and the opposition on how to turn 
around the moribund economy and end the countrys political 
paralysis 
the governments failure to stop the economic decline and 
improve supplies of scarce foods and consumer goods has led to 
growing demands for lukanovs resignation from frustrated citizens 
an official survey broadcast on television saturday said lukanov 
had a 50 percent approval rating last month 71 percent supported 
him 
despite surviving the confidence vote lukanovs government 
faces more pressure by the main opposition alliance the union of 
democratic forces which has called for a mass demonstration in 
sofia on sunday 
the opposition trade union confederation podkrepa has called a 
general strike for monday if lukanov does not resign by then 
despite a warning by the prosecutor general that political strikes 
are not permitted 
the government issued a statement saturday on television 
demanding the strike be called off saying it would endanger our 
parliamentary system intensify the political instability and 
have an extremely detrimental effect on the international prestige 
of our young democracy 
the main trade union confederation announced it would not 
support the strike 
opponents seeking lukanovs resignation demonstrated in sofia 
every day last week 
but on saturday government supporters gathered outside the 
firedamaged headquarters of the socialist party to cheer lukanov 
who declared he would not resign under pressure 
the building which housed the former communist party before it 
became the socialist party early this year was set afire by 
anticommunist demonstrators in august 
about 2000 opposition supporters gathered within sight of the 
socialistsponsored rally chanting slogans against lukanov and his 
party 
a thick line of police equipped with riot gear separated the two 
demonstrations but some scuffles erupted when the progovernment 
rally began to disperse 
several hundred opposition supporters blocked the capitals main 
boulevard by sitting or lying in the road to block the way of 
progovernment demonstrators 
helmeted police with nightsticks called on the protesters to 
clear the street but refrained from using force to disperse them 
after about an hour the police withdrew and the protesters 
dispersed peacefully 
opposition leaders claim they would triumph in new elections 
they have repeatedly rejected lukanovs requests to join a broad 
socialistled coalition government insisting instead on naming the 
premier and holding key ministries 
the socialist party won free elections in june and holds 210 
seats in parliament the opposition union has 144 seats 
lukanov repeated he was open to dialogue with the opposition and 
reiterated his determination to push through badly needed reforms 
to turn around the failing economy 
however he warned that he could not promise easy days under 
the tough reforms the program will be difficult even cruel

the american family therapy association has 
canceled plans to hold its 1992 convention in minneapolis to 
protest a state law requiring teenage girls to notify their 
parents before having an abortion 
the group objects to the 1981 law which also mandates that 
minors seek a judges permission if they want to avoid notifying 
their parents the us supreme court upheld the law in june 
the cancellation means a loss of nearly 180000 to the local 
economy according to peter hedlund vice president of the greater 
minneapolis convention and visitors association that figure is 
based on attendance of 300 conventioneers 
marilyn mason a minneapolis psychologist and a member of the 
american family therapy association board said friday that the 
board decided by a 100 percent consensus to boycott minneapolis 
when it learned of the minnesota law during a massachusetts retreat 
in september 
since our organization opposes government interference in the 
reproductive decisions of americans especially those that deny 
poor americans their right to privacy we cannot in good 
conscience have our convention in minnesota mason wrote in a 
letter to the editor of the star tribune 
rachael haremuftin the associations president told 
minneapolis mayor don fraser and st paul mayor jim scheibel of the 
cancellation in separate letters 
my impression is that the law we have doesnt work very well 
but its the legislature thats got the responsibility fraser 
said 
greg ortale president of the convention and visitors 
association said if thats the way they feel they should go 
with their beliefs 
the law was in effect five years before a challenge by several 
abortion clinics led us district judge donald alsop to declare it 
unconstitutional in 1986 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals later ruled that the law 
was valid but blocked its enforcement pending a us supreme court 
review 
in june the nations high court ruled that states do not impose 
an undue burden on pregnant girls by requiring them to notify 
parents or receive court permission if they dont want to tell 
their parents after the supreme courts ruling the minnesota law 
was reinstated aug 27

he said those who failed to understand that the mexican election 
system had changed will be exposed publicly 
salinas took office in december 1988 and has promised to clean 
up mexican elections in 1989 the government recognized an 
opposition party victory in a gubernatorial race for the first time 
in decades 
but opposition figures claim the government has repeatedly 
resorted to fraud in other state elections by organizing caravans 
of illegal voters ballot box theft and inaccurate voter rolls 
in yucatan polls by the private surveying agencies opina and 
conciencia indicated a strong pri lead throughout the state 
conciencia noted however that 47 percent of the registered 
voters surveyed refused to give an opinion 
the pri in power for more than 60 years is far more organized 
than the opposition and has more rewards to give backers in the 
form of jobs favors and government spending 
it is also the only party running in all 106 municipalities 
including 32 where it is unopposed 
the leftist mexico city daily la jornada reported that 
opposition parties saw little chance to win more than 20 of the 
mayoral races

leftist democratic revolution party told the state election 
commission friday there were signs of impending vote fraud

polling locations and districts which could allow people to vote 
twice 
they also complained that the pridominated electoral commission 
rejected 60 poll watchers from the national action party and 45 
observers from the democratic revolution party 
the daily el universal said the opposition proposed having 
electoral commission members sign individual ballots at the close 
of voting to prevent additions of forged ballots later

meetings of the federal electoral college which is certifying 
results of the nov 11 elections in mexico and hidalgo states to 
protest alleged fraud

easter islanders protesting a doubling of 
the air fare to the mainland stormed the islands only landing 
strip blocking a flight carrying 200 tourists authorities said 
saturday 
the chilean carrier lan canceled the flight to tahiti until at 
least monday when airline officials are scheduled to discuss the 
fare hike with the governor of the south pacific island 
lan the only airline operating to the island increased the 
roundtrip fare from the island to the chilean mainland from 206 
to 410 
the island with a population of 2000 annexed by chile in 1888 
is about 2300 miles west of santiago it is famous for giant stone 
carvings of heads and hieroglyphs whose origins are the subject of 
debate 
the protest began friday when a group of mostly young islanders 
blocked the jet as it prepared to take off 
some of the protesters remained on the landing strip saturday 
police said several had parked trucks and cars to prevent the 
airplane from taking off 
island officials pleaded with the protesters to clear the strip 
airline officials said they agreed to a meeting monday with the 
islands governor jacobo hei and said the fare increase may be 
reversed 
but interior minister enrique krauss said the government will 
not subsidize the fare because residents in other remote areas 
would certainly ask for a similar treatment and we can not do 
that

veteran peace campaigner tony benn told the crowd that opposition

negotiate a peaceful solution to the crisis and the release of 
foreign hostages held by iraq

leftist groups 
police seized leaflets passed out by greens officials urging 
german soldiers to desert in case they were sent to the gulf 
german officials say the countrys constitution prevents the 
government from sending troops outside nato areas and there are no 
german soldiers with the international force in saudi arabia 
but chancellor helmut kohl has said he will seek a 
constitutional amendment that will allow germany to participate in 
military actions sponsored by the united nations 
other leaflets distributed at the rally condemned the brutal 
regime of iraqi president saddam hussein his aggression against 
kuwait and the taking of foreign hostages but the leaflets said

engineers corrected a ground control 
computer error which halted the magellan spacecrafts mapping of 
venus nasa officials said saturday 
everything is fine said bob macmillan spokesman for the 
national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
the problem was corrected about 8 am saturday 2 hours before 
the start of the next mapping cycle 
it was a rather minor disconnect last night because of some 
command errors transmitted from the ground the spacecraft didnt 
recognize a series of commands and decided to put itself in a safe 
position macmillan said it did not break communications the 
way it did in august it just reduced its information rate it sent 
back slow signals but no mapping data 
the spacecraft which circles venus every three hours and 15 
minutes lost about three orbits after it stopped mapping 
about 8 pm friday he said 
it was the second report of problems with magellans mapping 
mission in eight days the magellan signal was lost for 40 minutes 
nov 15 signals were lost twice in august 
engineers have lost contact with magellan three times for 
reasons not yet fully understood but believed to be electric 
static interfering with a spacecraft computer 
magellan was launched from the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 it went into orbit around venus on aug 10 and formally 
started its 744 million mapping mission sept 15

britain and syria may soon restore 
diplomatic relations the official news agency in damascus reported 
saturday ties were cut four years ago over syrias alleged support 
of terrorists 
the thaw may also raise hopes for the release of some of the 13 
westerners held by proiranian moslem extremists in lebanon where 
syria has about 40000 troops 
an editorial in the syrian government newspaper tishrin earlier 
this month linked the release of hostages with restoration of 
anglosyrian relations 
the official syrian arab news agency said foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa conferred saturday with david gorebooth a 
british foreign office official 
the foreign office in london confirmed that gorebooth 
undersecretary responsible for relations with the middle east was 
discussing bilateral problems that prevent the resumption of 
diplomatic ties 
the meeting was held shortly after the syrian minister returned 
home with president hafez assad from geneva where assad and 
president bush discussed the persian gulf crisis friday 
the tishrin newspaper which normally reflects government 
thinking held britains outgoing prime minister margaret thatcher 
responsible for blocking improved ties mrs thatcher announced her 
resignation last week 
it was the first public contact between british and syrian 
government officials since november 1986 when london severed 
relations after accusing syria of masterminding an attempt to blow 
up an israeli jetliner at heathrow airport outside london seven 
months earlier 
in december 1988 a damascusbased radical group the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command was 
implicated in an explosion aboard a pan am jumbo jet over 
lockerbie scotland 
however no one has been prosecuted for the attack which killed 
270 people later reports from us intelligence and other sources 
blamed libyan and iranian terrorists for the pan am bombing 
the tishrin newspaper had criticized mrs thatcher for taking no 
steps toward improving ties after syria sided with the western 
alliance against iraq following the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it also attacked britain for allegedly pressuring its 11 
partners in the european community to maintain sanctions against 
syria which deprived damascus of an annual 192 million 
development loan and restricted the number of syrian diplomats 
allowed to work in ec capitals 
the us state department still lists syria as one of the main 
middle east countries that sponsor terrorism and violate human 
rights 
however us officials had publicly thanked syria for helping 
secure the release of american hostages robert polhill and frank 
reed in lebanon last april ireland said syria helped free brian 
keenan an irish citizen in august 
the 13 remaining hostages include six americans four britons 
two germans and an italian the longestheld western hostage in 
lebanon is associated press chief middle east correspondent terry 
anderson who was kidnapped march 16 1985

emergency shelters reopened saturday as rainswollen rivers spilled 
over and drove close to 2000 people from their homes in the second 
wave of floods this season 
the hardest hit areas were in western washington 
at least 19 rivers were at flood stage saturday because of heavy 
rainfall in the cascade mountains the national weather service 
said between 6 and 9 inches of rain had fallen in the mountains in 
24 hours 
as many as 15 highways were closed in places major road 
closures included us 101 near lake crescent on the olympic 
peninsula and us 2 a major eastwest route across the state 
the flooding cedar river closed the renton municipal airport 
for the second time in only two weeks scores of residents of 
fir island about 50 miles north of seattle were evacuated as the 
rising waters of the skagit river broke through a dike damaged in 
the first wave of floods 
i think we have to assume the worst at this point because the 
levees are in such tough shape said mark stewart spokesman for 
the state division of emergency management they suffered a lot 
of damage in the floods two weeks and they have continued to stay 
saturated 
its a very serious situation were very concerned 
the red cross opened emergency shelters in affected areas and 
the state dispatched its last 35000 sandbags to flood fighters 
the state has already gone through a stockpile of 100000 
sandbags since veterans day weekend another 150000 were on order 
but were yet to arrive 
we are literally scouring the countryside to come up with 
additional sandbags said dick milne another spokesman for the 
state rescue agency weve had so much rain in last two weeks 
and especially in the last 24 hours the ground is saturated and 
it cant go anywhere 
evacuations along the skagit river could involve as many as 
1200 people based on estimations of the number who fled two weeks 
ago 
that first floods inflicted more than 40 million damage in 
skagit snohomish and whatcom counties gov booth gardner has 
requested emergency federal aid for victims of that flooding 
nearly 500 people were evacuated from fir island during the 
earlier flooding which submerged 8000 acres of farmland many who 
had returned to begin cleaning up their homes were forced out again 
saturday 
don nieshe 37 said he and hi family had been unable to return 
to their island home since the first flood and were staying with 
relatives on high ground 
he was at the scene saturday surveying the damage in hip boots 
the familys bicycles were loaded in a rowboat 
theres nothing we can do everythings a mess inside 
nieshe said 
the swollen skagit river topped the island dike and created a 
150foot hole at the same point where water forced a 300foot gap 
two weeks ago undoing repair efforts 
the army corps of engineers planned to airdrop thousands of 
sandbags to fill the break 
upriver nearly 700 people were evacuated from the rural 
communities of hamilton cape horn thunderbird and allen 
high waters between monroe and sultan closed an 8mile stretch 
of state highway 2 the rising stillaguamish river lapped at the 
edges of interstate 5 
while rivers were rising north and east of seattle the states 
largest city was unaffected milne said 
there are no large rivers in the city and a drop in elevation 
forces river water through seattle quickly not allowing it to 
spread beyond the river banks

signs posted around the university of 
californiaberkeley campus last week expressed student outrage over 
a professors charges of admissions discrimination against whites 
and orientals 
the debate over the views of anthropology professor vincent 
sarich has grown into a controversy involving the campus chancellor 
and questions of free speech and academic freedom 
the dispute came to a head nov 7 when some 75 people burst into 
sarichs lecture with shouts and chants the session was cut short 
chancellor changlin tien has threatened expulsions of students 
warning that further disruptions would not be tolerated he also 
asked for an investigation 
he further warned that if a complaint about sarichs alleged 
discriminatory remarks were issued a careful review of 
sarich would follow 
the warning alarmed faculty members who said theyre concerned 
their courses might become limited to what is considered 
politically correct 
many of us disagree vehemently with some of the things sarich 
says but i have concern about this sort of thing getting out of 
hand said anthropology professor brent berlin 
the controversy started after sarich wrote an article in the 
fall for the uc alumni magazine sarich a molecular 
anthropologist said ucberkeley admissions policies have 
systematically and increasingly discriminated against white 
students and institutionalized racism on our campus 
he said thousands of white and asian students with perfect 40 
grade point averages and high test scores had been denied admission 
to ucberkeley in the name of diversifying the student body 
sarich 55 teaches what he admits are unpopular theories about 
human evolution including the possibility that brain size might 
make a difference in intelligence and that race may make a 
difference in ability 
he told a reporter that he teaches biological factors that 
influence but dont necessarily determine differences if there 
are any differences they have got to be absolutely minimal as 
compared to ethnic and cultural differences he said 
sarich said most of his students defended him after the 
classroom disruption even though they may not have agreed with all 
of his views 
they the protesters were locked onto the idea that something 
he was saying was racist sexist or homophobic they simply 
didnt know anything about what sarich was teaching or saying 
one of his students wrote 
but english professor david lloyd who had debated sarich in the 
alumni journal called sarich profoundly irresponsible for what 
hes saying

secretary of state james a baker iii failed 
saturday to gain immediate support from colombia and malaysia for a 
proposed un resolution authorizing the use of force to oust iraq 
from kuwait 
both countries are key nonaligned members of the un security 
council 
we had a very good meeting theyre going to study the 
proposals that we have talked about the things that we have 
consulted with other countries about and they will be back in 
touch with us baker said of his meeting in los angeles with 
malaysian foreign minister abu hassan 
cant count votes until theyre cast baker said 
hassan said he offered baker no promises but said he would 
discuss the matter with the rest of malaysias cabinet ministers on 
wednesday 
we are good friends of the arab countries both sides of arab 
countries iraq and saudi hassan said 
earlier saturday baker met with colombian president cesar 
gaviria and other officials during a fourhour visit to the south 
american nation afterward foreign minister luis jaramillo said 
colombia had not decided how it would vote on such a resolution 
colombia one of 10 nonpermanent members of the 15member 
security council has voted in favor of all 10 previous 
resolutions which include a call for iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
and a trade embargo on baghdad 
but jaramillo speaking at a news conference with baker seemed 
to reject a military option against iraq saying finding 
peaceful solutions to conflicts is a fundamental thesis within 
colombia foreign policy 
he said however that colombia stands firm with the world 
community in rejecting iraqi aggression 
baker whose visit saturday was the last leg of a fiveday tour 
of security council member states said prospects for an immediate 
solution to the persian gulf crisis were not good 
perhaps the best way to achieve a peaceful solution is not to 
rule out the use of force it may be the only thing saddam hussein 
understands baker told reporters 
he did not indicate if the united states has enough support in 
the security council to pass such a resolution 
he said prospects were not good for an immediate solution to the 
crisis so far we see no withdrawal and in fact we see no 
inclination of saddam hussein to withdraw 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 in a dispute over land oil and 
money about 350000 troops from 26 nations are massed in saudi 
arabia against 460000 iraqi troops deployed in southern iraq and 
kuwait 
in beijing spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
said saturday the security council could pass the proposed 
resolution on using force against iraq before the end of this week 
he spoke after meeting with chinese leaders on the gulf crisis 
but made it clear that his view did not result from his discussions 
with them 
china has refused to say how it would vote on a resolution on 
military force as one of the five permanent security council 
members china has veto power over resolutions the other permanent 
members are britain france the soviet union and the united 
states 
a day earlier britains foreign secretary douglas hurd said 
the un security council probably would meet next week to discuss 
the issue it was the first indication enough support had been 
gathered for the measure 
the soviet unions un envoy also said friday that foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze would attend a security council 
meeting next week to discuss iraqi aggression and to issue a 
strong serious and precise warning to baghdad

thousands of poles in chicago helped shape their 
homelands future saturday by casting absentee ballots in the first 
presidential election since communisms collapse in poland 
we are all very happy about the turnout so far it is 
difficult to say how many will come andrzej jaroszynski a 
polish consul in chicago said about midday 
he estimated upwards of 15000 out of some 40000 chicago area 
poles eligible to vote in the polish elections would cast 
ballots

the contest pits labor leader and solidarity party founder lech 
walesa against prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and four lesser 
known candidates 
the us returns could prove important if the vote is close in 
poland where more than 27 million people are eligible to vote 
at the least a high us turnout would encourage the same in 
poland said chicago alderman roman c pucinski a walesa backer 
who represents the heavily polish 41st ward on the citys northwest 
side 
if theres a good turnout you will have a bandwagon effect 
pucinski said as he stood in front of the polish american congress 
one of three polling places in the city 
a steady stream of voters moved through the modest twostory 
brick building at saturday when an almost celebratory air pervaded 
the activity around voting booths 
i just think its great slawek kosycarz a 28yearold 
manager of an office supply company in suburban niles said after 
casting his ballot my vote was for walesa hes the one who 
brought the whole thing down

friend edward figarski 37 a steel press operator in chicago 
took photographs of each other after voting 
to show to family in poland said ms stelmaszok a divorcee

the leader of the medellin cocaine 
cartel is among hundreds of drug traffickers who have offered to 
surrender in exchange for special judicial treatment a colombian 
politician said saturday 
cartel chief pablo escobar is absolutely interested in 
surrendering said diego montana cuellar the former leader of 
the leftist patriotic union party 
montana is one of four colombian political leaders including 
two former presidents who last week delivered a cartel peace offer 
to the government 
as many as 300 medellin cartel members would be willing to enter 
a highsecurity compound guarded by either the army or 
international human rights groups the message said 
the peace offer did not specifically mention escobar accused of 
masterminding several assassinations and terrorist bombings since 
colombian officials began a crackdown on drug cartels last year 
escobar was indicted by a federal grand jury in february in 
tampa fla on trafficking charges he was also named in the 1988 
indictment in miami which included former panamanian leader manuel 
noriega 
several major cartel figures have been extradited to the united 
states 
montana said the cartel leaders want to be judged collectively 
and avoid individual trials the cartel letter also demanded the 
government protect surrendering traffickers from colombian 
assassins and the government should not make the traffickers 
confess 
president cesar gaviria had already offered surrendering drug 
suspects trial in colombia rather than extradition and promised 
reduced prison sentences for traffickers who confess and become 
informants 
montana said gaviria received the cartels letter with the 
promise he would study it and respond to all of the proposals 
i think the president will give the cartel a positive response 
within the next few days montana said 
but some political analysts say the demands may be hard for the 
administration to accept many suspects are accused of trafficking 
aboard but have no charges against them in colombia 
if they are not extradited they could walk free according to 
judicial experts 
government officials have also repeated they will not negotiate 
with the cartel named after the city where its operations are 
based 
also montana said be believed escobar in the next few days 
would release nine journalists held hostage by the cartel 
escobar ordered the kidnappings of the journalists to use them 
as a shield from authorities montana said now that he is 
planning to turn himself in he no longer needs the hostages

washington ap supporters of the proposed two forks dam in 
colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by 
federal environmental officials to kill the project 
if the veto of the dam by the environmental protection agency is 
sustained it could set a precedent for similar projects they 
said 
william h van schooneveld chairman of the metropolitan water 
providers that sponsored the colorado dam said this decision 
affects not just denver but it may be the end of all big water 
projects if epa can veto this there really isnt any project that 
anybody can develop that can pass the epa 
there are a lot of grounds for a federal court appeal he 
said 
epa announced the veto of the dam friday night confirming 
earlier unofficial reports the dam would have been the largest 
nonfederal water project in the west it had been supported by 
reagan administration officials

tis the season for mailorder giving and more of the gifts 
crisscrossing the nation make for a transportable feast 
fruit in the mail is nothing new but how about six pints of 
assorted gelato packed in dry ice its yours if someone doesnt 
mind paying 10 a pint to get it to you 
and forget the mundane fruitcake select instead a bouquet of 
porcini mushrooms a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly 
pears 
the 3600 companies that tempt the palate with mailorder 
edibles are competing for the 12 billion that americans are 
expected to spend on food orders this year according to a recent 
study by the new york market research firm findsvp 
growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent mailorder foods 
are likely to account for more than 3 billion in sales by the year 
2000 findsvp said 
business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter with some 
mailorder companies doing virtually all their shipping between 
september and january entire 747 jets have been stuffed with 
nothing but thousands of pounds of holiday pears from harry and 
david 
harry and david a yamanouchi pharmaceutical division based in 
medford ore is among the nations largest mailorder food 
companies 
according to findsvp the top 10 foodbymail companies control 
45 percent of the market about 3000 companies are characterized 
as momandpop operations each with sales of less than 50000 
a year 
though the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation 
most of the industrys growth is in overnight and twoday delivery 
services which can guarantee a delicate or perishable item arrives 
intact 
clambake celebrations of cape cod mass for example can 
promise a customer in albuquerque nm that she will have 
lobster mussels and a few ears of corn all packed in authentic 
seaweed steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after phoning in 
the order the cost 11995 for two 
san franciscos gelato classico italian ice cream is just 
begining to offer its products by mail six pints which comprise 
a minimum order at 5995 are packaged in dry ice in a foam 
container much like a picnic cooler 
consultant jay walker who heads ridgefield connbased catalog 
media corp said that though foodbymail has been big business 
for a long time overnight delivery allowed a freshness 
perception for millions of people who didnt believe they could get 
food fresh in the mail and it made sure food can be given as a 
gift reliably 
if you ask federal express spokesman brandon davis will tell 
you his company has been a major boost to the food industry 
our business allows them to extend their business season 
right up to dec 21 he said if you do 80 percent of your 
business in one or two months of the year and can extend that 
selling season by just two weeks its a tremendous boost 
companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business 
because they cater to a national rather than local clientele 
franklin foods of north franklin conn for example sells only 
exotic mushrooms like polish cepes shiitakes and porcinis 
smithfield vabased fin n feather will put a smoked pheasant 
buffet on your table 
mr spear inc of stockton calif has cultivated a list of 
25000 fans of its colossal asparagus its sole product its an 
alternative to flowers said president chip arnett 
his superpremium asparagus which has been served at the white 
house simply is not in sufficient enough quantities to make it 
available from a retail standpoint he said 
consultant walker believes the foodbymail business is 
countercyclical to the economy that is as the recession 
deepens business is likely to increase 
consumers who feel pinched for cash typically trade down 
when it comes to buying gifts and food is a popular alternative 
because it has no comparative market price walker said you 
dont know if a dozen apples from an orchard in oregon is a 20 
gift or a 40 gift he said 
perusing catalogs in the coziness of ones own home and ordering 
with the mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational 
pastime of sorts for many americans 
people are sitting home and theyre bored and so they pick up 
the phone and buy on a credit card said debbie cohen a national 
saleswoman for melissas world variety produce inc a los angeles 
company that specializes in shipping in exotic produce like purple 
potatoes elephant garlic and prickly pears 
though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less 
than 2 percent of the population they are an affluent lot willing 
to pay more for convenience and a guarantee of quality 
a pint of gelato classico costs just 395 in one of the 
companys 32 shops but the minimum 6pit mail order commands a 
36 shipping charge too extravagant to buy for yourself perhaps 
but an exquisite gift to give 
the mailorder business does have its limitations 
identifying customers can be costly and it is difficult to 
adapt quickly to changes in consumer taste a company that must put 
together its christmas catalog by august cant suddenly decide to 
replace its pecan pie if cranberries become the rage 
in addition the threat of higher postal rates always looms 
large thirdclass postage the rate for most catalogs has 
increased more than 350 percent since 1970 and the us postal 
service is planning another rate hike for february 
mailorder companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on 
a higher proportion of their sales forcing them to compete harder 
against local retailers 
finally since the food business is seasonal some companies 
actually are forced to shut down during spring and summer others 
try to round out their offerings with other products harry and 
david for example has a sister company called jackson and 
perkins a gardening and flower concern which helps smooth out 
sales throughout the year 
to further entice customers many companies have a 
thingofthemonth plan for 21995 harry and david will send 
a box of fruit once a month for 720 gelato will send six pints 
of its superpremium ice cream 12 times a year and you get to 
choose among flavors like fresh ginger double espresso and coppa 
mista with swirls of chocolate vanilla pistachio and almond ice 
creams 
among other special services companies provide baskets of 
elegance a california fashioner of gourmet food baskets sends 
customers a color photograph of their orders before theyre 
shipped
