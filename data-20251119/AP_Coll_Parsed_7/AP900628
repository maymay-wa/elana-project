pat geiger known around town as 
the elvis lady has spent the past seven years keeping elvis 
presley alive 
elvis the postage stamp that is 
from the kitchen table of her tidy comfortable home on route 
10 geiger runs the elvis postage stamp campaign her goal is 
to convince the us postal service to give the king its stamp 
of approval 
without question elvis presley is the perfect subject for a 
us commemorative postage stamp geiger said he was and even 
though he left us 13 years ago continues to be one of this 
countrys greatest goodwill ambassadors 
her devotion may pay off a postal service official says elvis 
is indeed still alive in a postal sense 
theres a very good chance that sometime in the future there 
will be an elvis stamp said frank thomas a postal service 
marketing specialist in washington dc personally i think 
there will be 
the major obstacle for a presley postage stamp is concern over 
the lifestyle issue thomas said the postal service has received 
mail complaining that honoring a known drug abuser sends a bad 
message to americas youth he said 
but geiger scoffs at that notion pointing to other stamp 
subjects with controversial private lives presley stamps already 
have been issued in at least seven countries including west 
germany she said 
since beginning her campaign in 1983 geiger said she has gone 
through five postmasters general and is now on her sixth anthony 
frank 
frank reportedly said soon after taking office that he supports 
an elvis stamp but after the ensuing outcry over presleys 
welldocumented drug abuse the king died of an overdose in 1977 
frank retreated and said the issue requires further review 
his wavering prompted geiger to publicly call him a wimp 
it also renewed her determination to honor the man she credits 
with changing her life 
i will not give up until either elvis gets his stamp or i die 
whichever comes first the 70yearold greatgrandmother said 
over a lunchtime beer 
to understand the extent of geigers passion for presley one 
must visit her house it is walltowall and floortoceiling 
elvis posters line every wall most highlighting presleys 1970s 
jumpsuit phase 
bookcases are stuffed with presley tomes both reverential and 
scandalous shelves burst with videocassettes of presley movies 
and photo albums hold thousands of pictures thats not including 
her records and tapes 
the first presley picture geiger bought a blackandwhite shot 
taken at a 1969 press conference will be buried with her she vows 
pictures are my addiction geiger said then adds pardon 
me evis for using that word 
presleymania came late in geigers life although her older son 
dressed in pink and black in the 1950s to emulate presley geiger 
did not convert until a 1968 tv show known as the comeback 
special 
i looked at that man in that black leather suit and said 
phew geiger said i sat in that chair and said nobody is 
that good looking it was kind of sudden i was never the same 
after that night 
the postage stamp entered her life in 1983 when a fellow 
presley fan mentioned the idea after some investigating geiger 
learned ordinary citizens are not eligible for stamp consideration 
until 10 years after their deaths 
so geiger spent the next several years laying the groundwork for 
her big 1987 push 
i thought it would be a simple thing she said boy was i 
naive 
postal service officials have come to know geiger well thomas 
said she is in fact one of their best customers firing off 
letters to anybody connected with the agency 
you name em ive written to em she said waving a wrist 
adorned with an elvis presley watch 
commemorative postage stamps are nominated by the 15member 
citizens stamp advisory committee which meets every two months 
and then must be approved by the postmaster general thomas said 
although presley has been eligible for three years he still has 
not been chosen for the honor does this mean elvis the stamp 
is dead 
no not at all thomas said 
the committee might include presley in a stamp series on 
american musicians but that doesnt sit well with geiger 
elvis was one of a kind there will never be another she 
said he does not fit into a group 
the committee will announce next years commemorative stamps 
within a month thomas said 
if they dont announce it that doesnt mean it wont show up 
in 1991 he said the fact that theyre spending so much time 
on the subject is a positive sign 
meanwhile geiger waits impatiently and spends her days mostly 
on presleyrelated matters there are the constant letters from 
supporters around the world the radio appearances the newspaper 
interviews 
how did i get here i absolutely do not know she said 
next to my children hes the most important person in my life i 
dont know what id do if there wasnt an elvis

not far from satans alley and a deadend street 
called god 48 families live in a public square they are victims 
of a war on squatters waged by a city of plenty with little room 
for its poor 
since march 15 when a winter moratorium on evictions ended 
riot police arriving before dawn have cleared dozens of buildings 
the evictions inspire denunciations demonstrations and charges 
that the city of paris where housing prices are soaring is trying 
to push the poor out of town 
were miserable here because we have nothing said assa kan 
a 30yearold woman from mali with six children they are among 150 
people who have lived under tents since may 2 in the place de la 
reunion 
at night its really cold she said caressing the chapped 
cheeks of her 4monthold daughter all the children are sick 
hers is the largest of three camps set up by squatters or 
renters turned out of condemned buildings nine families camp at 
the foot of sacre coeur the montmartre basilica and six live 
outside a city government office 
in announcing the spring offensive paris officials said 
squatting had reached inadmissible proportions 
the city is dutybound to solve this problem and evictions 
are the only way to stop the multiplication of squatters said 
jean tiberi deputy to mayor jacques chirac 
within days 300 people were homeless nearly half of them 
children 
these people had a right to squat said abbe pierre a 
bearded roman catholic cleric who is frances premier champion of 
the needy when a man is hungry he has the right to take bread 
from the baker 
abbe pierres humanitarian organization the emmaus community 
provided tents for those evicted 
a siege mentality prevails in the place de la reunion which is 
ringed with rosebushes and dotted with orange and blue tents 
amenities consist of one water spigot three portable toilets 
like those used at construction sites and intermittent lighting at 
night via an extension cord from a nearby cafe one tent serves as 
a kitchen 
mrs kan and others said they would remain until the city 
provided a suitable alternative 
we are confronted with the unacceptable bertrand main 
deputy chief of the league of human rights told reporters 
demands for rehousing are met with a wall of silence 
incomprehension and sometimes contempt 
paris proposed temporary housing for the evicted in buildings 
scheduled for demolition in st denis a poor northern suburb 
officials there objected 
we dont have a money problem in paris we have a problem of 
land tiberi the deputy mayor said in explaining the housing 
shortage on french radio 
for moral reasons we cannot accept the principle of 
rehousing squatters who rob legal occupants of apartment space 
he said 
at a news conference abbe pierre said it is a crime to 
refuse lodging in a city like paris where several thousand 
apartments are vacant 
the committee against poor housing a protest group that finds 
vacant buildings for squatters claims there are 3000 to 4000 
vacant governmentsubsidized moderate rent housing units around 
paris the city denies it 
officials say the number of buildings occupied by squatters 
most of them africans has grown from 36 to 187 in three years and 
41 of the buildings are subsidized units which have a waiting list 
of 50000 
mayor chirac said in a letter to abbe pierre made public june 
20 that rehousing evicted squatters would be a profound 
injustice to people on the waiting list paris is a city with 
heart he said but neither the capital nor the paris 
region can take in all the misery of the world 
critics claim the city is being transformed into a ghetto for 
the elite 
president francois mitterrand denounced those who enrich 
themselves while sleeping because they own a good piece of land 
or a nice apartment 
prices have risen so quickly he said that they are starting 
to exclude the possibility of suitable lodging for senior 
executives with salaries that can reach 50000 francs per month 
about 8700 
frederica koch and amina amara are among those keeping a vigil 
with the homeless at the place de la reunion 
ms koch was evicted last year from the rentcontrolled 
apartment she occupied for 25 years and at 58 is a squatter she 
lost her job as a clothes cutter during a 10year battle to keep 
her home 
ms amara a single woman with five children has been on a 
waiting list for a lowrent apartment for 15 years after eviction 
from one building she and her two youngest children spent a year 
in a shabby hotel and two months in a restaurant basement before 
squatting anew in december 
this problem is too big for us said berhima tembely an 
immigrant from senegal who paid a sympathy visit to the square 
the rich people are treating us like dogs you have to fight to 
live in this world

the recording industry but it was also not a new york city all 
crowded bryson said in an interview 
i wanted to develop my writing style here learn to make 
recordings now the producers are here the equipment is here im 
glad i stayed

marine geologists say they have 
found evidence of a huge land bridge that linked new zealands 
north and south islands during the peak of the last ice age 20000 
years ago 
since the 1950s scientists have believed that a very narrow 
land bridge once existed that would explain the discovery on the 
north island of rocks and remains from animals thought to be unique 
to the south island 
but recent survey work by department of scientific and 
industrial research marine geologists suggests that the bridge was 
a broad windswept plain fanned by numerous rivers which fed the 
bridge with sediment 
it probably had a open seawardfacing western shoreline 
battered by a harsh climate of storms and strong southwesterly 
winds 
scientist scott nodder said recently that based on the 
preliminary work he believes the bridge probably was exposed 
during a time when sea levels were low during the peak of the last 
ice age 
as the ice age waned the bridge was breached at its most 
shallow point about 15000 years ago creating the cook strait 
nodder said he has used a combination of core sampling and echo 
sounders to survey below the sea floor that has revealed a 
combination of sediments and a sequence of sea beds that lend 
weight to he huge land bridge theory

americans under age 30 know less about whats 
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in 
the past 50 years according to a study of how people keep up with 
the news 
it found that younger americans are less likely than earlier 
generations to have read a newspaper or watched a television news 
show 
when people under age 35 were asked 25 years ago whether they 
had read a newspaper yesterday 67 percent said yes when the 
same question was put this year to a slightly younger group people 
under age 30 only 24 percent said yes 
television newswatching has dropped too in 1965 52 per cent 
of people under 35 said they watched the tv news yesterday 
this year 41 percent of those under 30 said they caught the tv 
news yesterday 
the study said that from 1941 to 1975 young americans were on a 
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most 
major news events closely but since 1975 younger people have been 
less attentive and the trend is accelerating it said 
the information age has spawned an uninformed and 
uninvolved population concludes the study it was conducted by 
the times mirror center for the people and the press sponsored by 
the company which publishes the los angeles times the centers own 
polls and those of four other polling organizations taken over the 
years were analyzed 
even though the average 30yearold is more likely to use a 
computer to have attended college and even more likely to be 
reading a book than someone 20 years senior the younger generation 
knows less about the world the study said 
in the latest measurement 12000 random sample interviews 
conducted between may 1989 and last march were analyzed the number 
of young people who could correctly answer questions about current 
news was at its lowest level since pollsters started asking 
questions about familiarity with the news in the early 1940s the 
polls had a margin or error of plus or minus 2 percentage points 
social scientists and pollsters have long recognized that 
younger people have usually been somewhat less attuned to politics 
and serious issues the study said but the difference now is 
more striking than ever before 
the armymccarthy hearings watergate and vietnam were stories 
followed closely by young and old alike however since the mid70s 
young people have shown much less interest in most news including 
the biggest stories with the most farreaching implications 
the exceptions sports news and the abortion issue there the 
young match their elders in news interest 
in 1989 25 percent of each group kept up with the world series 
41 percent of the young and 33 percent of people over 50 knew about 
the supreme courts most recent major abortion ruling 
but the survey reported younger americans are 20 percent less 
likely than those over 30 to know who won the recent election in 
nicaragua what happened to romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu or 
what the soviet unions role has been in the political upheavals of 
eastern europe 
the study said that in the 1940s a majority of people both 
those under and those over 30 could identify norman thomas the 
american socialist and in the 1960s twothirds of young people and 
59 percent over those over 50 could identify earl warren the chief 
justice of the united states from 1953 to 1969 
by contrast in a march 1990 survey less than a quarter of 
people under 30 and less than half of those over 50 could identify 
jim wright who resigned a year ago as speaker of the house of 
representatives or helmut kohl chancellor of west germany 
a newspaper editor william b ketter of the quincy mass 
patriot ledger called the findings distressing 
i think it is symptomatic of our fastfood fastpaced society 
where they want everything instantly and dont want to concentrate 
on newspapers and apparently that even extends now to 
television said ketter he is chairman of the readership 
committee of the american society of newspaper editors which is 
seeking ways to make newspapers more attractive to readers 
i call it a dangerous camel under the tent because i think if 
our society becomes less informed about the events that go on in 
the world and at home it becomes less vigilant for the protections 
of the constitution and that could spell problems ketter said

east germany will bid goodbye to an old 
currency by burying it in salt mines and feeding it to foundries 
clearing the way for new cash and a radically different way of life 
at the stroke of midnight saturday the 42yearold east german 
mark of the ousted communist regime will be replaced by one of the 
free markets most powerful forces the west german mark 
an east german who buys a beer with his old money in the minutes 
before midnight could have his change brought back in west german 
marks so quick is this change to take place 
that modest event would signal the economic unification of the 
two german states the end of four decades of east german socialism 
and the de facto creation of a single germany 
the west german state bank the bundesbank has trucked in 25 
billion uncirculated west german marks said spokesman sigfried 
guterman in frankfurt 
transporting money is our business he said wednesday 
this was a little more complicated 
guterman said heavily guarded trucks from bundesbank offices 
throughout west germany brought 600 tons of paper money 400 
million individual bills and 500 tons of coins during the past 
two months 
the money was distributed to 15 different cities the east 
german state bank has been taking that money to 10000 different 
locations where it will be available to east germans beginning 
sunday 
long lines at banks nationwide continued as east germans filled 
out forms to convert their savings accounts to west german marks 
guterman said there have been no major problems replacing one 
currency with another virtually overnight 
the 25 billion in west german marks is new uncirculated cash 
that should be enough to accomodate the nation guterman said 
east germany now only has 123 billion east german marks in 
circulation said bernd schroeter spokesman for the east german 
state bank 
all citizens will be asked to deposit their remaining east 
german cash in banks by july 6 there it is to be counted sorted 
and wrapped 
after final inventory the bills will be stored in salt mines 
pending their later destruction schroeter said 
east germany is not equipped to burn large amounts of bills in 
environmentally safe ways he said guterman said east germany 
might have to use the bundesbank facilities to burn the money 
most of the coins are pure aluminum which drew chuckles from 
westerners and two denominations are in copper schroeter said 
these will be melted down and recycled 
the east german currency is small and flimsy compared with the 
large west german bills 
the 50mark bill carries the picture of friedrich engels who 
with karl marx drafted the blueprint for modern socialism the back 
depicts a giant factory spewing smoke 
the east german currency was nonconvertible and virtually 
worthless outside the east bloc after the east german revolt last 
autumn it was traded on the black market at a 201 rate for west 
german money 
now small savings accounts will be traded at a 11 rate with 
larger amounts converted at a 21 rate 
the bundesbank has been planning a new west german currency for 
years and will begin circulating some notes on oct 1 by the end 
of the next year guterman said all the current money will be 
replaced 
concidentally one of the first bills that goes into circulation 
on oct 1 the 100 mark note will depict the east german city of 
leipzig 
it is more or less by accident guterman said nobody knew 
there would be a currency union when these bills were designed 
leipzig is on the back of the bill because it is the birthplace 
of the person on the front 19th century german pianist clara 
schumann leipzig is also the home of the an east german currency 
mint and guterman said it will be used to print part of the new 5 
mark note

californias lampooned and lauded 
selfesteem task force goes out of business sunday but its backers 
feel really good about its accomplishments 
its creator state assemblyman john vasconcellos says the task 
force brought selfesteem from an object of ridicule to a subject 
of respect throughout our state across our nation and even now 
around our entire world 
selfesteem formerly only cautiously addressed in the privacy 
of therapeutic encounters and personal growth weekends has now 
become legitimate and mainstream in conversation and in 
practice said vasconcellos a democrat from san jose 
virginia and maryland created their own task forces last year 
and several other states are considering it fortynine of 
californias 58 counties now have their own selfesteem task forces 
vasconcellos will present the task force work to the annual 
convention of the national conference of state legislators in 
nashville tenn in august the same month the first 
international conference on self esteem is scheduled in oslo 
norway 
the california task forces 144page report toward a state of 
esteem has sold more than 20000 copies at 4 each since coming 
out in january the report defines selfesteem as appreciating my 
own worth and importance and having the character to be accountable 
for myself and to act responsibly toward others 
while the law creating californias task force expires on july 
1 vasconcellos has plenty of plans for the future 
its a conclusion of a phase like a commencement he said 
a bill moving through the legislature would create a state 
ombudsperson for selfesteem to monitor state agencies and see if 
theyre following the task force recommendations another bill 
would provide 100000 to the nonprofit national council for self 
esteem so it can replace the task force as a clearinghouse for 
selfesteem information 
vasconcellos became interested in the subject nearly a decade 
ago partly because of his own painful personal struggle 
despite repeated successes and achievements in my life to develop 
my own selfesteem 
also as chairman of the assemblys budgetwriting ways and 
means committee he saw the state pour billions into toolittle 
toolate efforts to confine andor repair our fellow californians 
he proposed a selfesteem commission in 1984 it took until 
1986 and one veto to get lawmakers and gov george deukmejian to 
agree the california task force to promote selfesteem and 
personal and social responsibility was given a threeyear life at 
245000 a year 
shortly before its first meeting in april 1987 cartoonist garry 
trudeau spent three weeks lampooning the task force in his 
doonesbury comic strip the airhead character boopsie an 
actress and outofbody traveler was named to the task force 
trudeau pulled out all the california jokes about newage music 
hot tubs and reincarnation 
the nation laughed but the task force members were not angry 
the doonesbury thing was a curious thing that made us 
famous that gave us a national audience immediately that we could 
not have bought vasconcellos said 
the task force went to work with few further sniggers and a 
growing respect it produced a report listing effective selfesteem 
programs in california such as teaching arts in state prisons and 
giving selfesteem training to welfare recipients in napa county 
its 46 recommendations range from making childrearing courses 
more available to requiring teachers to have selfesteem training 
to reducing class sizes 
but vasconcellos in his budgetwriting role is faced with a 
199091 state budget with a potential 36 billion shortfall and no 
money for new programs 
its ironic and frustrating the saving grace is a lot of this 
doesnt cost any money its a change of attitude in people 
operating current programs he said some money is needed to 
support selfesteem education it would be helpful and a great 
investment 
all the task force members but one signed the report although 
seven wrote slightly critical comments the nonsigner david 
shannahoffkhalsa a del mar neuroscience researcher and yoga 
teacher said selfesteem cannot be injected or given to anyone 
other critics say the report only lists common sense conclusions 
it could have been figured out but it hadnt been responds 
vasconcellos but the truth is we have created a national 
awareness and i never thought we would come so far so fast 
he said the task force is stimulating further research and new 
programs seeking to determine if selfesteem is mostly innate or 
can be learned 
theres a chickenegg quality to it were learning about it 
we have lots more to learn the hope is were asking the right 
questions finally

marion barry slapped exmodel rasheeda moore 
to the floor after they smoked cocaine and he appeared indifferent 
when she nearly passed out after a big hit of crack she 
testified at the mayors drug and perjury trial 
moore said wednesday that she and barry used cocaine powder 
crack and opium more than 100 times in 15 private homes a 
restaurant and four hotels from 1986 to 1989 she said they were 
lovers during most of that time 
moore depicted barry as a man whose life was so consumed by 
drugs that he had her deliver cocaine to him at the mayors office 
they broke off their romance but continued to get together 
frequently to smoke crack she said 
prosecutors were expected to use moores testimony to introduce 
as evidence an fbi videotape made last jan 18 when barry allegedly 
smoked crack cocaine while visiting moore at a washington hotel 
she was cooperating in an undercover sting operation that led to 
his arrest that night 
moore testified wednesday that at a home after one cracksmoking 
session barry said he was addicted to cocaine 
he was tired he wanted to quit and had started going to 
church she said the mayor was talking about getting his 
spiritual life together 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor 
cocainepossession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy 
charge and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use one possession charge stems from the night of his 
arrest 
the threeterm mayor stared intently wednesday as the 
39yearold moore described their relationship barrys wife effi 
sat in the front row of the spectator section her face growing 
grim as the day wore on 
moore said that at barrys request one day in 1988 she bought 
40 worth of crack and carried it in a bag to his office 
the mayor was expecting me she testified i gave him the 
cocaine he gave me the money for it and i left 
at the mayors suggestion the two smoked crack at barrys home 
she said and also smoked crack at her mothers home on mothers 
day 
on another occasion she said barry nearly passed out in the 
basement of her mothers home after taking what he later described 
to her as a really great hit 
during city budget briefings in 1988 moore said barry passed 
her money to buy cocaine she testified that she left bought the 
drugs returned to the municipal building and waited for the 
mayor to finish his budget hearings so that the two could go 
out and use the crack 
she said barry became violent after one session in a hotel room 
where they smoked crack through a homemade pipe the mayor accused 
her of having a relationship with another man and slapped me 
moore said 
she returned the slap she said but ended up on the floor 
when barry slapped her again 
while she was on the floor barry stood over her and said i 
havent hit a woman in 20 years you bring the worst out in a 
man she testified 
another time moore said she started to pass out after i took 
a big hit during a cracksmoking spree with the mayor in the 
bathroom of a church leaders home 
she said she cried out marion marion but all of a 
sudden he turned the light off and wandered out of the bathroom 
while she stood there in front of the mirror 
she recovered her senses and followed barry who was moving 
very slowly moore said she asked him why he turned off the 
light and he replied i couldnt do anything there was nothing 
i could do 
i could have died she told the court it was just 
insanity 
she said the mayors security guards were aware of her drug 
purchases occasionally passing her money in envelopes from barry 
to buy cocaine 
i hope youre not going to be bad tonight she quoted one of 
barrys guards james stays as quipping to her as she went out to 
make a drug buy 
moore began cooperating with the government after her arrest in 
california for drunken driving she has been in the federal witness 
protection program since jan 29 because of threats on her life 
assistant us attorney judith retchin told the judge

wynton marsalis and pearl bailey were an unusual 
pairing for a jazz concert and sure enough the two halves of the 
evening were opposites 
singer bailey was show business wednesday night talking folksy 
and amusingly and strutting around between songs marsalis and his 
band went the other direction playing two long suites of composed 
structured jazz in an hour 
as a finale when bailey sang the battle hymn of the 
republic marsalis came out and played trumpet along with her and 
her quartet it gave the evening a pleasingly unified feeling it 
certainly hadnt had before 
moments before bailey sang hello dolly and announced this 
was her last concert before having a kneereplacement operation 
before that came the musical high point of the evening a long 
drum solo by louie bellson in after youve gone that was a 
marvel of sound fire subtlety and musicality 
marsalis and his band began the jvc jazz festival concert at 
avery fisher hall with uptown ruler suite and a suite about a 
man and woman sugar cane and sweetie pie the first piece was 
cerebral and the second more lively and swinging marsalis may 
aspire to be the duke ellington of today presenting new jazz 
suites and tone poems 
one could remain interested in these two pieces if one tried 
both had lots of instrumental solos but they didnt reach out and 
grab you like ellingtons bursts of melody and changing moods even 
for a jazz festival audience marsalis might do better to program 
only one of these per evening 
his band is fantastic marsalis articulate solos were 
understated but gained strength because of it 
the other musicians are todd williams and wessell anderson 
saxophonists trombonist wycliff gordon pianist eric reid drummer 
herlin riley and bassist reginald veal 
bellson played drums for bailey and paul smith was at piano 
keeter betts on d reaching down from the stage to shake hands she 
flung the microphone cord around and gestured with graceful hands 
she began with on the road again sang unforgettable in 
a quietly serious way as a tribute to nat king cole was 
fervent on for once in my life her distinctive voice was 
strong and true in can you read my mind 
just when one was getting impatient with the show biz patter 
bailey said oh pearl you are forever young for that 
infectiously upbeat statement one is quite won over

dr stuart wiles is committed above all 
to the 60000 mice pigs rats rabbits monkeys and dogs that are 
part of this citys 100 millionayear animal research business 
but the nations first commissioner of laboratory animals also 
must protect the interests of science in a city that is home to the 
massachusetts institute of technology and harvard university 
wiles doesnt have an office yet and hasnt started making spot 
checks but he has made contact with the 23 laboratories he became 
responsible for may 7 under a new city ordinance 
for animalrights activists wiles appointment represents a 
victory in their battle to ensure humane lives and when the time 
comes painless deaths for lab animals 
i feel for the animals said wiles 56 a veterinarian 
trained at bostons angell memorial animal hospital but i also 
understand the scientific perspective 
this balance is key to wiles popularity both with researchers 
and with moderate animalrights activists who allow that 
laboratory experiments are necessary but say they must be conducted 
under controlled conditions 
if youre going to have a commissioner it seems weve got a 
guy whos going to be fairminded and who understands all the 
issues ron suduiko assistant to mits president said wednesday 
wiles has seen the issue from both sides hes a longtime animal 
lover who founded a veterinary hospital in rural massachusetts and 
started his career as a supervisor at a harvard research center 
he served on a commission that developed the new ordinance 
which a year ago won 80 approval from the city council the law 
has also served as a model for proposed ordinances in lowell 
mass and evanston ill 
members of the medical and biotechnology community have 
generally accepted the ordinance which was developed after 
animalrights activists alleged possible laboratory abuse and the 
city launched an investigation 
the city found lab conditions humane but suggested a 
commissioners post be established to ensure that standards are 
maintained 
wiles will inspect academic and private laboratories which 
could face fines of 300 a day for violations such as unkempt cages 
or improperly executed euthanasia 
each laboratory must have an animalcare committee that includes 
a nonaffiliated member who will be screened and monitored by 
wiles 
it will be his job to make sure these independent members who 
include a nun lawyer and dance teacher understand and meet their 
responsibilities 
ill provide them with guidelines to follow when considering a 
proposed research project he said questions like is it 
worth it what are the projects goals do you have to use 150 mice 
or can you get by with 50 
federal law protects dogs cats and monkeys but excludes 
reptiles amphibians mice rats and rabbits the cambridge 
ordinance will cover all research animals 
suduiko said cambridge researchers have been concerned that the 
ordinance might impede their work on diseases such as aids and 
cancer 
but wiles has no plans to create a bureaucratic situation or 
be picky about the little things like an errant piece of garbage 
or a slightly lethargic mouse 
im looking at the bigger picture he said

countries hit by unrelenting 
waves of vietnamese refugees are getting tougher the boat people 
increasingly face being pushed back to sea or returned to this 
communist land they risked their lives to flee 
aid officials say malaysia took in more than 16000 vietnamese 
in 1989 but rebuffed about 8700 others in the past year 
indirectly causing some deaths 
other southeast asian nations implicity have threatened the same 
unless the united states by july 1 stops opposing the forced 
repatriation of those vietnamese judged to be economic migrants 
more than 117000 vietnamese refugees fill camps in the region 
it is now the 11th hour for the vietnamese boat people rep 
hamilton fish rny told a congressional hearing on june 21 
if first asylum is to be retained it must be at the 
uncomfortable price of reexamining the question of involuntary 
repatriation 
despite the increasing hostility there appears little letup in 
the exodus of more than 15 million people since the communists 
toppled the usbacked government of south vietnam in april 1975 
the desire to flee is so that strong western officials commonly 
talk of vietnams exodus mentality 
if you go to some of the provinces in the south leaving by 
boat is part of life there said kai nielsen representative of 
the united nations high commissioner for refugees in ho chi minh 
city formerly the south vietnamese capital of saigon 
people get arrested every day for trying to leave there are 
some people who have tried 10 to 15 times nielsen said 
in my age group all my friends are leaving by boat said a 
government employee 30 who may follow them a close friend who 
left in 1979 and came back to visit last year said its very sad to 
live outside your native land but its better to be in a country 
where you can study and have a job 
at risk is the collapse of the comprehensive plan of action on 
refugees adopted a year ago at an international conference in 
geneva 
the plan committed countries to give refuge to all boat people 
who are then screened to separate political refugees from economic 
migrants western countries are to resettle the refugees 
but the large majority are economic migrants who will strain the 
regions camps indefinitely because the united states and vietnam 
oppose their forced return that and the arrival of 16718 
vietnamese in 1989 an eightyear high turned malaysia from one 
of the most generous asylum nations into the most heartless 
the perception is that there is little to lose in breaking the 
rules and a big price to pay for following them said a western 
diplomat 
a total of 11722 vietnamese arrived in the region the first 
four months of this year down from 18351 the same period last 
year according to un figures that brought the camp population 
to more than 117000 
hong kong after a crisislevel influx in 1989 experienced an 
83 percent decrease in arrivals the first five months compared to 
the same period last year but arrivals in indonesia shot up 450 
percent as boats evicted by malaysia landed there and arrivals in 
thailand increased 385 percent 
indonesia has been accused of giving supplies to a new wave of 
boat people cambodians fleeing their vietnameseinstalled regime 
so they can sail onto australia 
the philippines another generous asylum country that has 
hardened recently let 343 vietnamese disembark from us and 
canadian warships that had rescued them only after getting 
assurances they would be resettled abroad by 1992 a singaporean 
ship was bounced between taiwan hong kong and thailand because 
authorities wouldnt accept the 17 vietnamese aboard 
southeast asia and britain hong kongs colonial ruler have 
castigated the united states for opposing forced return yet 
refusing to house the boat people on its own territory washington 
says it opposes force until there are dramatic economic social 
and political improvements in vietnam 
some diplomats said that guilt over us involvement in the 
vietnam war prompted washington to welcome those who flee they 
said vengeance prompted it to treat vietnam as an outcast to which 
it was not moral to return migrants 
but one diplomat said washington could compromise on what the 
vietnamese call the gray area between forced and voluntary 
repatriation people who are not actively opposed to 
returning he said such people wont state they want to return 
but would not protest if put on flights back home 
diplomats said vietnam opposes forced repatriation to project an 
acceptable world image and to maintain efforts to establish 
diplomatic ties with the united states those forced back also pose 
security problems 
hanoi accepted a group of 51 forced back from hong kong in 
december but has refused any more despite strong pressure from 
britain and malaysia 
more are volunteering and until recently this eased the 
pressure for forced repatriation 
since march 1989 more than 3000 have freely returned from hong 
kong mostly to northern haiphong and quang ninh provinces they 
bear news of harsh camp conditions and the wests compassion 
fatigue 
they go back to their home villages tell their relatives and 
neighbors and very quickly the message spreads said jacques 
mouchet representative of the un high commissioner for refugees 
in hanoi 
increasingly western nations say the exodus will never end 
unless they alleviate vietnams economic problems 
france and italy resumed aid the past year breaking the 
usled aid embargo imposed after vietnam invaded cambodia in late 
1978 through private groups britain recently funded development 
of areas from which people have fled

president bushs proposal to forgive billions 
of dollars in debt owed by latin american countries is being hailed 
as a longoverdue initiative that will help struggling democracies 
and boost us standing in the world 
the president laid out a package of proposals wednesday to 
forgive part of the 12 billion owed to the us government by 
latin american and caribbean countries bush said some of the debt 
could be swapped to buy environmentally endangered land 
in addition he called for work to begin on a hemispherewide 
free trade zone and said the united states would work with other 
developed countries to channel up to 300 million annually to latin 
america to spur foreign investment 
the proposals represented an aboutface for the administration 
it had been resisting congressional calls for debt forgiveness on 
the ground it could open the floodgates for domestic demands from 
groups ranging from farmers to people with old student loans 
the administration predicted that the latin american debt 
concessions would have little trouble winning congressional 
approval the initial reaction both at home and abroad was 
favorable 
brazilian president fernando collor de mello told bush in a 
phone call that his proposal was comprehensive bold and 
innovative a brazilian spokesman said 
honduran president rafael callejas termed bushs proposals 
encouraging news while a spokesman said mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari viewed bushs speech as a very 
important redefinition of the us position regarding economic 
development in latin america 
john reed head of citicorp a large us bank with about 8 
billion in loans in latin america said he welcomed the initiative 
as a way to bring economic growth and prosperity back to latin 
america 
the president acknowledged that in this changed world the 
united states cannot forget latin america said reed 
he said the proposal would meet some objections by commercial 
banks to the administrations third world debt plan outlined last 
year by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
bradys plan did not address debt owed to the united states and 
other governments but rather offered incentives for commercial 
banks to write off a portion of their 13 trillion in third world 
debt commercial banks had argued that they were being forced to 
shoulder the entire burden 
c fred bergsten head of the institute for international 
economics a washingtonbased research organization said the 
administration was recognizing that bolder foreign economic 
initiatives were needed for america to retain its leadership role 
in a postcold war world 
the united states really had been a laggard in debt 
forgiveness to other countries bergsten said a realization 
may be setting in that the united states may be shut out in world 
leadership unless it takes a more forthright stance 
brady told reporters that the new initiative for latin america 
could set a precedent for countries in other parts of the world 
particularly poland that nation has been pressing western 
countries to forgive part of its 39 billion foreign debt most of 
it owed to governments to bolster polands struggling economic 
reforms 
an administration official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said the issue of polish debt was certain to be 
discussed at the july 911 economic summit in houston 
officials explained that the debt forgiveness proposal would 
focus primarily on 7 billion of loans made at favorable rates 
primarily to finance purchases of us farm products the amount of 
debt forgiveness will be contingent on a countrys willingness to 
institute economic reform programs under the supervision of the 
international monetary fund 
the administration said part of the remaining 5 billion in 
loans owed to agencies such as the us exportimport bank could be 
used for debtfornature swaps to encourage third world nations to 
protect natural resources 
officials said smaller and mediumsized countries such as 
honduras el salvador and jamaica stood to benefit the most from 
the debt forgiveness plan because a higher percentage of their 
foreign debt was owed to the us government 
bush proposed a us contribution of 100 million annually to be 
matched by similar 100 million in donations from european nations 
and japan into an investment fund to provide incentives for latin 
nations to attract foreign investment 
the president said upcoming negotiations with mexico over 
removing all trade barriers between the two nations could set a 
precedent for establishing a freetrade zone stretching from the 
port of anchorage to the tierra del fuego at the southern tip of 
south america 
the united states already has a free trade agreement with canada

the nuclear regulatory commission says about 
onethird of the nations lowlevel nuclear waste is below 
regulatory concern thereby paving the way for industry to 
dispose of it as normal trash 
the new policy announced wednesday could end the special 
handling requirements for any radioactive products or wastes that 
expose people to no more than about 3 percent of the radiation they 
absorb naturally 
consumer groups condemned the policy change joan claybrook 
president of public citizen demanded the removal of all five 
members of the nrc charging they had elected to trade off 
peoples lives in favor of the financial interests of the nuclear 
industry 
nothing could be further from the truth nrc chairman 
kenneth m carr declared at a news briefing at the commissions 
headquarters in nearby rockville md none of this is going to 
affect public health and safety 
instead carr insisted the new federal policy placing the 
wastes below regulatory concern will allow federal and state 
regulators to spend our resources on threats that are more 
important we think that in the long run were going to save more 
lives 
rep george miller dcalif chairman of the house interior 
subcommittee on energy wasnt so sure 
im disturbed at the prospect of permitting the disposal of 
certain lowlevel radioactive wastes from nuclear power plants in 
thousands of landfills across the country he said it is 
imperative that congress closely scrutinize this new policy 
miller scheduled a hearing on the issue for july 26 
carr stressed that the policy decision does not free industry 
from current disposal requirements the nrc plans to air the issue 
at a nationwide series of public hearings 
barring a reversal industries then would have to prove on a 
casebycase basis that particular radioactive wastes fall within 
the guidelines for regulatory exemption 
the policy would apply to radioactive wastes involving the final 
stages of cleanup of decommissioned nuclear plants consumer 
products involving small amounts of radioactive materials and a 
variety of radioactive wastes generated by hospitals and research 
institutions 
aside from making disposal of such materials easier and cheaper 
it would open the way for some items to be recycled as consumer 
products 
jonathan becker who has traced the issue for public citizen 
said the policy change could mean that as much as onethird of the 
lowlevel radioactive materials now sent to special burial sites 
could be dumped into community landfills incinerators or sewer 
systems 
that could save the nuclear power industry hospitals and 
laboratories 82 million a year he said 
pennsylvania illinois new york north carolina alabama south 
carolina and california now generate the largest amounts of 
lowlevel radioactive waste each year 
becker said the nrcs own risk assumptions indicated the new 
policy could lead to an additional 2500 cancer deaths annually 
moreover he contended the decision flies in the face of recent 
reports by the national research council and the environmental 
protection agency that the cancer risk from radiation may be much 
higher than previously known 
in the northeast several nuclear utilities have pledged to 
continue to dispose of all radioactive wastes as currently 
prescribed no matter what the nrc does to avoid exacerbating 
public alarm about their operations 
under recent federal law the states must trim their reliance on 
dumps in nevada south carolina and washington state and build 
their own disposal sites either on a statewide or regional basis 
their plans are due by 1993 but several already face strong local 
protests from citizens who dont want nuclear dumps in their 
backyards 
the nrc says localized nuclear materials such as those in a 
dump site that subject individuals to radiation doses of less 
than 10 millirem per year would qualify for the regulatory 
exemption 
a stiffer standard 1 millirem per year would apply to recycled 
products or consumer goods that are broadly distributed such as 
smoke detectors or wristwatches with luminescent dials 
by comparison the nrc says americans receive 300 millirem or 
more per year in the normal course of their lives 
this includes an average 200 millirem from the air they breathe 
30 millirem from cosmic radiation 40 millirem from their food and 
drink and 30 millirem from soils and building materials a normal 
chest xray yields about 20 millirem

the hubble space telescope is crippled by a 
focusing flaw that may have been caused by an undetected 
prescription error during the manufacture of polished mirrors 
aboard the 15 billion craft 
nasas announcement of the problem wednesday sent a shudder of 
disappointment through an astronomy community that has waited years 
for what were expected to be unprecedented views of the universe 
from the orbiting telescope 
the space agency said the focusing problem in the hubble mirrors 
cannot be fixed from the ground and at least two of the five 
instruments aboard the spacecraft will be virtually useless until a 
repair mission is flown by the space shuttle 
plans call for such a mission in 1993 but the national 
aeronautics and space administration said it hopes to make the 
flight sooner 
an official of the danbury conn company that made the mirrors 
said the flaw may have been caused by a human error in testing of 
the primary and secondary hubble telescope mirrors as they were 
being ground and polished 
it appears that one of the elements may have been manufactured 
to a prescription that wouldnt give you the desired result said 
jack rehnberg chief of the space science office at the hughes 
danbury optical co it could have been a human error 
rehnberg said the problem could be either in the primary or 
secondary mirror or the manner that the two work together 
a nasa investigation led by lew allen of the jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena calif is expected to start this week 
hubble was placed in a 381mile orbit on april 25 amid dazzling 
promises by nasa that the telescope could revolutionize the human 
concept of the universe 
the telescope circling the earth far above the obscuring 
effects of the atmosphere was expected to be able to see objects 
such stars and galaxies that are 25 times fainter than those seen 
by telescopes on the ground 
for the first time hubble would permit humans to look up to 14 
billion light years into space some 84 billion trillion miles 
this could give a glimpse of objects as they were just a few 
billion years after the big bang that is thought to have 
started the universe 
instead said nasa scientist ed weiler images captured by the 
flawed hubble now will be little better than what can be done by 
telescopes on earth 
it is very disappointing extremely disappointing said kim 
leschly of the jet propulsion laboratory 
many people were hoping to see new views of the universe now 
well have to wait thats very very disappointing said david 
koo an astronomer at the university of california santa cruz 
hubble deputy project manager jean olivier said the misfocusing 
mirrors were discovered this week when engineers attempted to 
finetune the path of light between the primary and secondary 
mirrors 
he said they discovered there was no single one point with 
a crisp clean image 
additional testing showed that the problem was in the 
manufacture of the mirrors and that there was nothing that could be 
done from the ground to correct the flaw 
blaming the mirrors came as a surprise because nasa had touted 
hubbles 94inch primary mirror as the smoothest large mirror ever 
made 
but somehow a mistake was made said rehnberg of hughes danbury 
optical 
we could have erred in the assembly of some of the test 
equipment and it didnt get picked up even though weve had lots of 
reviews and checks and rechecks he said 
weiler said the focusing problems means that a faint object 
camera designed to detect objects not otherwise visible will see 
no better than instruments on the ground and a wide field camera 
will be virtually useless he said 
there is no real science we can do with it at this time he 
said 
three instruments that study stars in ultraviolet and infrared 
radiation will not be as seriously affected although a highspeed 
photometer will be able to do about half the science scheduled 
weiler said 
hubble has had problems from early in the program it was 
originally scheduled for launch in 1986 but was delayed for four 
years when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the challenger 
accident 
after the telescope was deployed in orbit on april 25 engineers 
learned that a cable was blocking rotation of an antenna the 
problem was corrected by limiting the antenna movement then 
engineers learned that a computer program was pointing the 
telescope at the wrong points in the sky computer software was 
changed 
the flawed mirrors on hubble cannot be taken out and replaced by 
the shuttle but weiler said replacement instruments could 
compensate for the misfocused mirrors with special optics 
we are pretty optimistic that we can take out all of the 
aberration said weiler 
olivier said the hubble mirrors were tested individually on the 
ground but never as a combination because that would have cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars 
hughes danbury optical then a division of perkinelmer built 
the hubble telescope assembly under a 450 million contract that 
included performance incentives

hundreds of opponents of sudans military 
government have been arrested more than 60 tortured and many 
others executed since a coup one year ago amnesty international 
said today 
the khartoum government claims all political prisoners have been 
freed but londonbased human rights organization said it has 
details of more than 200 prisoners of conscience still in detention 
without charge or trial 
those arrested include political leaders trade unionists 
academics lawyers and prominent human rights activists amnesty 
said in a statement 
it called on the sudanese government of lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir to release all political prisoners and take steps to 
prevent the torture of all inmates 
elbashir seized power last june 30 after ousting a civilian 
government in the north african nation 
he crushed a coup attempt in april by what he called leftists 
trying to replace his moslem government with secular civilian rule 
and make peace with southern rebels who are mainly christian and 
animist 
since a state of emergency was declared after the coup amnesty 
said hundreds of political opponents have been detained and many 
others executed or killed by government troops or militia 
the government itself has said it executed 28 active or retired 
army officers in connection with the april coup attempt 
amnesty said that in the past six months more than 60 prisoners 
have been tortured in safe houses and secret interrogation 
centers in khartoum by a new security force known as the security 
of the revolution which was formed after the coup 
one prisoner is reported to have died recently from torture at 
one of these centers where prisoners are secretly held for up to 
several weeks before being taken to prison amnesty said 
at the beginning of the year it said the government released 
90 political prisoners and claimed that all prisoners had been 
freed 
but amnesty said more than 200 were still detained including 70 
being held in grossly inadequate conditions at the isolated 
shalla prison in sudans western darfur province 500 miles from 
their families in khartoum 
some sick prisoners are not receiving medical treatment and 
inmates have reported poor meals filthy water and a complete lack 
of sanitary facilities the statement said 
under the military government amnesty said the scope of the 
death penalty has been broadened to include possessing foreign 
currency and organizing strikes prisoners sentenced to death since 
the coup have not been allowed to appeal their conviction and were 
denied full legal representation at their trials it said 
in southern sudan illegal killings by government forces and 
armed civilian militias have continued since the coup amnesty said 
the human rights group said more than 100 civilian 
noncombatants were deliberately killed by progovernment militia 
in areas of armed conflict in october and november and it said 42 
southerners disappeared in custody after their arrest in khartoum 
in late october 
more than 200 suspected government opponents were arrested in 
the town of juba in february with many still in detention without 
charge or trial it said

exports come to mind quickly at the 
agriculture department when the livelihood of american farmers is 
discussed and pacific rim countries are not far behind 
what happens in the rim notably japan and other east asian 
countries bears heavily on us agricultural exports and 
consequently the financial wellbeing of producers 
collectively commodity exports to the major pacific rim 
countries are increasing again this year but the growth is smaller 
than in 1989 a report by the departments economic research 
service said wednesday 
exports to japan south korea and taiwan are expected to 
increase but will not match the 10 percent gain of 1989 or the 28 
percent jump in 1988 the report said 
agricultural sales to canada are expected to rise sharply in the 
fiscal year that began last oct 1 because of a change in the 
reporting system the agency said sales to australia and new 
zealand probably will increase it said 
economic growth in the developed pacific rim slowed for the 
second straight year in 1989 the report said rising interest 
and inflation rates and labor shortages in east asia are straining 
the regions economies 
one factor was a strengthening of the us dollar against the 
japanese yen which possibly dampened demand for american farm 
products the report said meanwhile the dollar fell against the 
currencies of south korea taiwan and canada which helped boost 
export prospects 
domestic policies production and competitive exports are 
factors that draw attention from us analysts 
all developed pacific rim countries except new zealand 
increased their agricultural output in 198990 the report said 
gross farm income was higher in all countries government support 
to agriculture was generally lower in 198889 and is estimated to 
fall further for most countries in 198990 
consumer eating habits remain diverse in the developed rim 
countries the report said but diets in the asian countries are 
approaching those in western countries as consumption of animal 
protein grows and starch consumption falls 
australia a traditional supplier of grassfed beef is moving 
to supply grainfattened beef to japan that means more competition 
for american producers 
current australian feedlot capacity of about 600000 head is 
expected to double by 1992 the report said much of the recent 
feedlot expansion has been with japanese investment 
further the report said australia has the cattle feed 
grains and technology to be a significant us competitor in 
highquality grainfed beef to japan and other asian markets 
although problems remain with infrastructure and stable feed 
supplies 
new zealand and australia also have undertaken policy reforms 
that are aimed in part at making their farm products more 
competitive in world markets 
since 1984 new zealands farm sector has undergone a painful 
adjustment resulting from removal of direct farm support rising 
interest rates and an appreciating exchange rate between 1985 and 
1988 the report said the policy reforms in the two countries 
have lowered government assistance to agriculture

genetically altered potatoes that could be 
naturally deadly to beetles are being fieldtested in the pacific 
northwest by a team led by agriculture department scientists 
the outdoor tests were scheduled to begin this week in prosser 
wash geneticist charles r brown of the departments agricultural 
research service said wednesday 
ultimately we want to know whether potato plants could use 
this genetic weapon to combat colorado potato beetles with little 
or no chemical insecticide he said in a report issued here 
brown is based at the agencys vegetable and crop research unit 
in prosser and is collaborating with other scientists from the 
university of washington seattle and another usda researcher in 
yakima wash 
the quarteracre potato plots are at washington state 
universitys research and extension center in prosser 
brown said the added gene is from a strain of bacterium 
bacillus thuringiensis or bt that lives in soil naturally and 
makes a beetlekilling protein 
the prosser tests were said to be the first in the united states 
involving bt genes placed in potatoes other researchers at private 
companies and universities however have raised tomato cotton and 
tobacco plants that use a bt gene and show pest resistance 
brown said the colorado potato beetle is probably the worst 
potato insect pest worldwide and that it has become resistant to 
many pesticides

the agriculture department says china has 
bought an additional 139400 metric tons of us wheat under a 
price subsidy program 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said wednesday that six private 
exporting companies made the deals under the departments export 
enhancement program or eep 
delivery of the wheat is scheduled for october he said 
the sales were part of 2 million tons authorized for china under 
eep on may 2 previous allocations had been exhausted except for 
5050 tons dickerson said china has slightly more than 1 million 
tons remaining in its current allocation 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in 
selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged 1982 per ton or 
about 54 cents per bushel 
the subsidized sales were handled by continental grain co 
74400 bushels central states enterprises inc 35000 and 
mitsubishi international corp 30000

astronomers had hoped the 15 billion hubble 
space telescope would give their field its biggest boost since 
galileo first used a telescope in 1609 now the troubleplagued 
observatory may make them wait a few more years 
weve been waiting for a decade so to wait some more is 
pretty disappointing i guess well have to suffer said 
astronomer david koo of the university of california at santa cruz 
nasa announced wednesday that an apparent manufacturing error 
prevents proper focusing of the mirrors on the telescope which is 
the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built 
agency officials said that until shuttle astronauts can make 
repairs during a mission scheduled for 1993 the problem will make 
the telescopes most important instrument the widefield and 
planetary camera virtually useless nasa said it hopes to send a 
shuttle earlier 
the flaw also will make the telescopes second camera the faint 
object camera unable to take pictures any better than those made 
by a telescope on the ground the hubble was designed to study 
extremely distant stars and galaxies 
three other instruments which detect various types of light but 
are not cameras will be less seriously impaired 
its a major blow to our hopes said kim leschly widefield 
camera systems engineer at nasas jet propulsion laboratory it 
is very disappointing extremely disappointing 
if the telescopes mirrors worked properly the widefield 
camera would be able to make out an object the size of a baseball 
from a distance of 200 miles 
the camera was designed to help determine the age of the 
universe test theories of how the universe evolved search for 
possible planets orbiting nearby stars and map the surfaces of 
moons asteroids and comets 
there still will be images from the current camera that will 
be reasonably exciting but they wont push the frontier leschly 
said 
approved by congress in 1977 the launch of the hubble was 
delayed not only by the 1986 challenger explosion that grounded the 
shuttle fleet but by numerous technical problems it finally was 
launched from shuttle discovery in april 
scientists had ranked it with galileos first use of a telescope 
in importance 
leschly said jet propulsion laboratory employees reacted to the 
latest problem by asking how come people making the mirror 
didnt do their job right 
as part of the hubble team you feel disappointed somebody 
didnt do it right leschly said and that hurts 
the mirrors and their supports were manufactured by perkinelmer 
corp now hughes danbury optical corp of danbury conn company 
official jack rehnberg acknowledged human error may have been to 
blame 
people arent crying its just that there have been so many 
delays in this project that when you say wait another three years 
its slightly depressing said john holtzman an astronomer with 
lowell observatory in flagstaff ariz

soybean farmers say they support the war on 
drugs but they dont want the united states to encourage bolivian 
coca farmers to grow soybeans instead of the leaf used to make 
cocaine 
but a house agriculture subcommittee chairman says the war 
against cocaine must not take a back seat to the interests of us 
soybean farmers 
as long as drugs remain the scourge they are to this country 
they must be of highest priority especially when the threat of 
competition to us farm interests is minimal as appears to be the 
case in this instance rep dan glickman dkans said at a 
hearing wednesday of his subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed 
grains 
soybean farmers want to help in the drug problem but its not 
a good use of taxpayer dollars to subsidize competition if it 
doesnt reduce drug production james lee adams chairman of the 
american soybean association said 
he said his group did not lobby the agriculture department to 
block use of federal funds for a us agency for international 
development program in bolivia that was promoting soybean farming 
as an alternative to coca 
but allan mendelowitz of the general accounting office told 
the subcommittee that an investigation of the situation revealed 
there is frequent ongoing contact between the american soybean 
association and the agriculture department 
bolivia is second to peru in coca leaf production after 
processing in colombia most of the bolivian leaf is sold as 
cocaine to drug users in the united states 
president bush signed an agreement feb 15 at the drug summit in 
cartagena colombia with the presidents of bolivia colombia and 
peru to encourage crop substitution and nontraditional exports 
as an alternative to the coca trade 
i dont think there is a greater priority today than the war 
on drugs added rep glenn english dokla im dumbfounded by 
the response we got from the american soybean association the 
department of agriculture should be severely chastised for any role 
they had 
christopher goldthwait of the agriculture department said the 
federal program known as pl 480 or food for peace paying for 
the bolivian soybean project restricts aid to commodities that do 
not compete with products grown in the united states 
we remain concerned that project funds would contribute to 
expanding bolivian soybean production for export which in turn 
could adversely affect us producers at a time when they were 
already losing markets he said 
mendelowitz said soybeans offer one of the best alternatives to 
coca for bolivia on the export market though not enough soybeans 
are produced to be a real threat to american growers 
in 1989 bolivia exported about 44000 tons of soybeans while 
us producers exported 17 million tons mendelowitz said 
frederick schieck of the agency for international development 
said us officials didnt start out to encourage bolivians to grow 
soybeans 
he said the original goal was increased wheat production but 
because the growing season is long enough for two crops farmers 
rotated into soybeans after the wheat harvest 
he said bolivia has a long way to go before any crop will 
replace the 300 million a year in foreign exchange earnings 
experienced from coca exports 
bolivia produces an estimated onethird of the world supply of 
coca leaf and is the most cocadependent of the andean countries 
he said about 250000 bolivians work in coca production

the supreme courts decision to let states 
shield children from trauma when they testify in abuse cases is a 
victory for children according to a youth welfare group 
many states already have adopted measures to protect young 
witnesses in this growing area of criminal law and now may 
determine whether their procedures meet the new guidelines set by 
the court 
most states permit the use of videotaped testimony of sexually 
abused children or allow oneway closedcircuit televised 
testimony some have a twoway system in which the child witness 
can see the courtroom and the defendant on a monitor while the 
judge and jury view the child 
the high court said wednesday such measures may be 
constitutional depending on what safeguards are built in for 
defendants the court in a pair of 54 rulings said people 
charged with child abuse have no guaranteed right to confront their 
young accusers face to face 
the ruling highlighted a hectic conclusion to the courts 
198990 term leaving what are expected to be only some routine 
housecleaning chores the justices did not plan to be on the bench 
today when announcements are made in those matters 
in other action wednesday the court 
upheld federal policies that favor minorities in awarding 
broadcast licenses a major victory for affirmative action by a 
54 vote in cases from florida and connecticut the justices said 
preferential federal communications commission policies aimed at 
providing diversity over the nations airwaves do not discriminate 
unlawfully against whites 
limited the power of environmentalists to sue in federal court 
to prevent opening of federal lands to commercial development 
upheld arizonas death penalty law in a decision that also 
removes a constitutional cloud from similar laws in idaho and 
montana 
ruled in a maryland case that most of the nations post offices 
may ban all soliciting on their property 
the court examined the child abuse issue in cases from maryland 
and idaho and generally heartened advocates of childrens rights 
a states interest in the physical and psychological 
wellbeing of child abuse victims may be sufficiently important to 
outweigh at least in some cases a defendants right to face his 
or her accusers in court justice sandra day oconnor wrote for 
the court 
the number of cases is growing more than 22 million child 
abuse reports were filed in 1988 according to the national 
committee for the prevention of child abuse 
this is a victory for children said joyce strom of the 
child welfare league of america this is a step in the right 
direction of strengthening a judicial system to protect children 
and acknowledge their special need 
the decisions were not a total victory for the states 
writing for the court in the maryland case oconnor said states 
may not simply disregard the right of defendants to confront their 
accusers 
states must show the elimination of the facetoface 
confrontation is necessary to protect children and that steps have 
been taken to assure the testimony of the young witnesses is 
reliable she said 
oconnor said trial judges may shield children from such 
confrontations only when there would be substantial emotional 
trauma not if the youngsters merely are nervous or reluctant to 
testify 
the court upheld the childmolesting conviction of the owner of 
a clarksville md day care center four young children were 
allowed to testify via closedcircuit tv out of the defendants 
presence 
by a separate 54 vote the court refused to reinstate a boise 
idaho womans child abuse conviction thrown out by the states 
highest court because the child did not testify a pediatrician 
testified at the trial about his interview with the 2yearold 
alleged victim

soviet human rights activist yelena bonner says 
president mikhail s gorbachev has become an obstacle to 
democratic change and that the communist party should step aside 
and take the government with it 
the 73yearold wife of the late soviet physicist and nobel 
peace prize winner andrei d sakharov also accused gorbachev and 
the communists of provoking ethnic conflicts and blocking economic 
progress in the soviet union 
at the beginning when gorbachev declared all these changes 
he made a very serious nontrivial step but during the last two 
years he has not moved forward ms bonner said in an interview 
tuesday 
she said gorbachevs reforms since he came to power five years 
ago have done little to improve the lot of the soviet people 
it turns out all the changes were made to guarantee him 
personal power he becomes an obstacle to democratic change ms 
bonner told the associated press 
sakharovs widow was in israel to dedicate a jerusalem park in 
the honor of her late husband and accept an honorary degree in his 
name 
ms bonner married sakharov in 1971 and lived with him in 
internal exile in the volga city of gorky from january 1980 until 
december 1986 when gorbachev allowed sakharov to return to moscow 
ms bonner said she felt a strong democratic trend in the soviet 
union among people who seek a smooth transition to democracy 
but the communist party is blocking it and this provokes 
conflict she said 
ms bonner noted that sakharov who died dec 14 had pushed for 
a multiparty system and demanded that state land be given to the 
peasants by the spring of 1989 
but instead of embracing the changes suggested by sakharov that 
could feed us in just two years the government introduced a 
limited system of leasing some land from collective farms under 
which people are not free attempts to revive industry have 
also failed ms bonner said 
she said the communist party has been slow to relinquish its 
political monopoly despite promising to do so and that the 
leadership has maintained its old authoritarian ways in dealing 
with restive soviet republics 
ms bonner cited the bloody dispute over the majority armenian 
enclave of nagornokarabakh in soviet azerbaijan that dispute has 
grown into almost a guerrilla war between the two republics 
instead of following a democratic decision by karabakh leaders 
who voted in favor of armenian rule she charged gorbachev 
adopted stalinist constitution regarding the wholeness of 
borders and thus ignited the conflict 
gorbachev would change the constitution in two hours to assure 
an increase in power for himself but when it came to people he 
decided the constitution could not be changed and statehood 
prevailed she said 
earlier this year gorbachev pushed legislation through the 
congress of peoples deputies that expanded the power of the 
presidency to which he was then reelected by deputies 
now soviet security forces are stationed in the capitals of the 
rival republics ms bonner said she feared this stupidity of 
military and political leadership could lead to worsened 
interethnic bloodletting 
ms bonner also blamed the soviet authorities for equally 
violent ethnic outbursts in soviet central asia that she said 
resulted from worsening economic and ecological conditions 
we not me and not the russians but the central 
administration led central asia to complete devastation we have 
destroyed a piece of the planet with our own hands ms bonner 
said 
her long list of criticisms of gorbachev included his economic 
blockade of lithuania after the baltic republic declared 
independence on march 11 since then there have been moves by 
several other soviet republics to secede 
now other republics gradually declare themselves sovereign and 
they all adopt laws saying their local laws prevail over the soviet 
ones ms bonner said gorbachev and the leadership have lost 
their power they must work out a new agreement with the republics 
and they will have exactly the amount of power the republics are 
ready to grant them 
in the future ms bonner said she saw the soviet union as a 
coalition of free nations perhaps with a mutual defense pact that 
are bound by economic agreements 
i dont know what he gorbachev wants she said all his 
economic and political changes in the country are very ambivalent

huge going out of business sale banners 
plastered across the display windows of garfinckels department 
store obscured the mannequins in stylish black cocktail dresses and 
upscale beachwear 
carole melham was shocked shes been shopping at garfinckels 
since she was a little girl growing up in suburban chevy chase md 
i just cant imagine they could let this happen she said 
standing on the sidewalk in 80degree heat waiting for the doors to 
open wednesday 
its symbolic of a lost era like the paris of the 1920s 
she said i was raised on garfinckels shopping was a major 
event my mother bought me tons and tons of things here i remember 
when there was a doorman to greet you 
it was another world i loved the atmosphere the high 
ceilings the elevators the sales clerks whod look for good buys 
and set things aside for you garfinckels stayed oldfashioned 
and it never went down the tubes it was a very classy store 
all thats left are congested malls in the suburbs where 
everyone chews gum the merchandise has gotten so bad the big 
stores its like shopping in a zoo or a barn its so raunchy the 
world has changed its all very depressing 
garfinckels an elegant washington landmark for 85 years 
announced last week it was seeking protection from creditors in 
federal bankruptcy court and closing seven of its nine stores 
including its flagship downtown emporium at the busy intersection 
of 14th and f streets 
retail industry analysts said garfinckels had fallen victim to 
aggressive competition from bloomingdales neimanmarcus 
nordstrom and other large national department stores that have 
muscled into washingtons affluent suburbs in recent years 
garfinckels troubles were compounded by a succession of five 
owners whose conflicting marketing strategies confused and 
disappointed their traditional customers who included the rich and 
powerful of washington many of them took their business elsewhere 
the liquidation sale is intended to clear garfinckels store 
shelves and display cases of all merchandise valued at 22 
million within 60 days under a courtapproved deal an estimated 
9 million to 10 million of the sale proceeds is expected to go 
directly to one of garfinckels principal secured creditors 
mrs melham and her small son timothy were among hundreds of 
whitegloved matrons their yuppie offspring and eager bargain 
hunters who swarmed through garfinckels polished bronze doors at 
noon wednesday 
they snapped up garfinckels trademark luxury items waterford 
crystal hermes scarves countess mara silk ties godiva 
chocolates givenchy pantyhose and christofle silverware at a 20 
percent discount 
within 15 minutes the front doors were ordered closed 
temporarily to contain the throng a short time later two of 
garfinckels woodpaneled elevators jammed under the crush of 
shoppers trying to get upstairs 
i feel so very sad said gertrude hallila 72 who has been 
a loyal customer since she arrived in washington during world war 
ii she remembers riding the trolley with her children for a day at 
garfinckels with lunch in the greenbrier room 
maria kostecka who lives in the posh suburb of potomac md 
said she was extremely upset over garfinckels demise 
she liked the excellent clothes the dignified atmosphere 
no shoving or pushing in the spacious aisles and the very

about 9 million americans could get money to 
pay expenses for college or vocational training each year if a 
portion of the social security surplus is invested in a revolving 
loan fund a group of economists said today 
the economic policy institute released a proposal by university 
of massachusetts economist barry bluestone and colleagues to make 
available to every american a lifetime line of credit of 
40000 to finance the costs of college or university education or 
vocational training or apprenticeship 
social security surpluses estimated by the congressional budget 
office to reach 73 billion by 1991 would be used to underwrite 
the program costs would total about 40 billion per year but are 
expected to rapidly decrease as the surplus continues to grow 
borrowers could take up to 25 years to repay their loans by 
means of a levy on future earnings the internal revenue service 
would be charged with the collection duties through payroll 
deductions 
the key domestic issues facing america in the 1990s will 
center on questions of equity in both sense of the term the 
report said equity means fairness but it also refers to 
investment such as corporate stock that pays dividends based on the 
profitability of an asset 
the proposal called the equity investment in america program 
applies the dual meaning of equity to mitigate the financial 
barriers to college and university schooling and vocational 
training for all students regardless of income age or social 
background 
the report pointed to statistics that show the ratio of annual 
earnings of college graduates to high school graduates has 
increased from 15 to one in 1963 to more than 18 to one in 1987 
an increase of 20 percent a recent survey found that onethird of 
the students who delayed or indefinitely put off college pointed to 
the expense involved 
the federal government has moved to disenfranchise middleclass 
students from federal assistance by restricting eligibility for 
grants the report said 
in 1979 the government set a 32500 ceiling on family income 
for a student to be eligible for grant support today despite 
inflation a family must have an income no higher than 28000 to 
be eligible for aid 
the largest federal loan programs the stafford student loan 
provides a maximum of 2625 per academic year for the first two 
years of undergraduate study and 4000 for each subsequent year 
up to a fiveyear maximum of 17250 
students over four years must add an average of 9750 out of 
pocket to attend a public university and at least 26750 to go to 
a private institution 
the new program would assist about 9 million students each year 
7 million to 75 million in colleges and universities and 17 
million in vocational training the study said 
bluestone and coauthors alan claytonmatthews and john havens 
of boston college and howard young of the university of michigan 
said their plan would create a new education department agency to 
raise capital for the program make the awards to students and 
oversee repayment 
under the plan loan repayment amounts deducted by the irs would 
remain low if a students income after college is low and increase 
an income levels increase 
across all participants in the system the combination of 
increasing incomes irs collection of loan repayments and long 
repayment schedules will result in full repayment to the social 
security system the authors said

the bush administrations support for a 
tenfold increase in child labor law fines is a welcome change from 
the reagan eras handsoff attitude democrats and union officials 
say 
any imposition on businesses that just wasnt done this 
notion of increasing fines is a big improvement aflcio 
spokesman rudy oswald said wednesday of the endorsement by labor 
secretary elizabeth dole 
mrs dole in testimony prepared for the house labor standards 
subcommittee today backed legislation to increase from 1000 to 
10000 the maximum penalty for businesses that employ youngsters 
in dangerous jobs or for too many hours 
mrs dole also supported stiffer criminal penalties so that 
prosecutors could seek jail terms for firsttime willful violators 
currently jail terms are only available upon the second conviction 
the higher fines are in a bill by reps charles schumer dny 
and don pease dohio 
mrs dole has talked about cracking down on this before and 
it was met with skepticism one has got to take her seriously 
now pease said wednesday 
schumers office called doles support a welcome change 
the current penalties have not been changed since they were 
established in 1974 
we seek a balance our goal is to impose penalties which are 
strong enough to deter violations but do not dissuade lawabiding 
employers from offering productive work experiences for youth 
mrs doles testimony said 
besides higher fines oswald called on the labor department to 
increase the size of its enforcement staff to ensure that 
businesses arent exploiting children 
since march federal labor agents have conducted two nationwide 
sweeps of fastfood chains and other businesses finding nearly 
20000 violations of child labor laws 
mrs dole said one reason child labor violations have increased 
dramatically in recent years 128 percent since 1986 is the 
nations tight labor market the workforce has been expending at an 
annual rate of only 1 percent its slowest rate in nearly 40 years 
faced with a shrinking pool of workers some employers have 
reacted by putting young people to work in unsafe conditions or 
for hours beyond the limits of the law mrs sole said

nelson mandela paid silent tribute wednesday at 
the tomb of martin luther king jr and the slain civil rights 
leaders widow fervently upheld mandelas right to depart from 
nonviolence in the struggle for black rights in south africa 
mandela did not speak during the brief wreathlaying ceremony 
which included the singing of the anthem of the us civil rights 
movement we shall overcome 
later the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference that king founded told mandela 
we reject the constant nagging you have experienced about 
violence we respect the right of oppressed people everywhere 
to seek their own liberation 
the audience of more than 1500 people at big bethel ame church 
cheered wildly 
coretta scott king said reverend lowery has spoken for all of 
us and he spoke well we support you we love you we revere you 
mandela told the audience as a result of your support and the 
hospitality you have shown us now it is futile for the white 
minority in south africa to resist the peoples demand for 
oneperson onevote 
mandela later addressed a soldout rally at 46000seat grant 
field praising king as a giant among giants he quoted kings 
famous i have a dream speech which ended with the declaration 
let freedom ring 
let us all exclaim let freedom ring in south africa he 
said 
the stadium crowd stood and cheered chanted and waved their 
fists for 1 minutes when mandela took the podium where he brought 
the georgia audience greetings from the fighting people of south 
africa 
the rally capped the fourth stop on mandelas us tour after 
new york boston and washington he arrived in miami on wednesday 
just before midnight 
mandela was greeted at the alexander hotel on miami beach by up 
to 200 supporters but the visibly tired mandela was hustled to his 
hotel room 
the crowd chanted free south africa and then free south 
florida and finally where is suarez the last chant referred 
to miami mayor xavier suarez who denounced mandela for his support 
of cubas fidel castro 
in atlanta martin luther king iii told a reporter that 
mandelas visit to the center named for his father showed that 
clearly he does not support violence i think mr mandela wants 
nonviolent solutions but the government has pushed him to that 
some local civil rights officials had suggested mandela should 
follow kings philosophy and renounce violence but upon his 
arrival here wednesday morning the founder of the african national 
congress wasted no time reminding the group of his view that black 
south africans face a different battle than the one king led 
unlike you we are still under the grip of white supremacy 
mandela said at the airport to reporters he added nonviolence 
is a good policy when conditions permit 
king was assassinated in 1968 five years after mandela began 
his 27year prison stay for plotting sabotage to overthrow the 
minority white government of south africa the government released 
him in february and negotiations are underway aimed at dismantling 
apartheid 
a scheduled midday break for the 71yearold mandela was 
extended delaying the wreathlaying ceremony by about three hours 
mandela has at times canceled events to rest during his grueling 
14nation tour of europe and north america a downpour soaked the 
1300 people waiting near kings crypt a carnival atmosphere set 
in when the rain stopped complete with popcorn vendors and music 
from a military band 
mandela was cheered by about 5000 people along auburn avenue a 
historic stretch of black businesses and civil rights landmarks as 
he arrived at the martin luther king jr center for nonviolent 
social change 
after a brief meeting with mrs king and other dignitaries 
mandela and his wife winnie placed the wreath at the crypt which 
sits above a reflecting pool at the king center 
mandela also received honorary doctorate degrees from 40 
predominantly black colleges at a convocation at morehouse college 
later he was to appear at a soldout rally at the 46000seat grant 
field 
mrs mandela received a standing ovation from a gathering of 
1500 people mostly women at a 100aplate luncheon benefiting 
the anc 
i cannot tell you how touched i am by this warmth your 
kindness and your identity with our struggle she said we come 
from racist south africa you are reminding us what it is to 
belong to a family of mankind 
at hartsfield atlanta international airport gov joe frank 
harris a white conservative democrat called mandela an 
inspiration and welcomed him to the birthplace of equality and 
justice for all of america 
mayor maynard jackson joined mandela and his wife winnie in 
raising a clenched fist salute during the playing of the ancs 
anthem 
security considerations kept the crowd at the airport to 200 
invited guests including a group of children from a cityrun 
interracial camp and a marching band along a nearby road about 
100 people strained to see the south african leader 
there was no sign of protest over mandelas refusal to repudiate 
libyan president moammar gadhafi cuban leader fidel castro and 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
but in the miami area where mandela was scheduled to address a 
labor meeting thursday no official welcome was planned and 
cubanamerican groups planned rallies to protest mandelas support 
of castro 
suarez and four area cubanamerican mayors have accused mandela 
for insensitivity to human rights in cuba and mayor alex daoud of 
largely jewish miami beach condemned him for ties to gadhafi and 
arafat 
black leaders vowed to take it upon themselves to welcome 
mandela 
he is our brother said johnnie mcmillian president of 
miamis naacp chapter if they say hes not welcome theyre 
saying were not welcome too 
mandelas address thursday to the american federation of state 
county and municipal employees in miami beach isnt open to the 
public so black leaders planned shows of support outside the hall 
and in a liberty city park where the speech will be broadcast over 
loudspeakers 
meantime leaders of various cubanamerican and anticastro 
groups met tuesday night to plan a protest at the convention center 
the atlanta crowd carried only promandela signs the john birch 
society bought a newspaper ad monday condemning mandela as a 
criminal but wednesdays crowd regarded him as a persecuted hero 
hes been in jail for 27 years for trying to help africa 
become a better place thats not right said 10yearold audrey 
durden 
im completely overwhelmed this is very historical not only 
for africa but for the world said ayesha naji 40 of atlanta a 
former resident of liberia he represents a worldwide hero for

timber workers figure a mock sign at a 
local tavern best tells their future 
notice to owldisplaced workers the sign reads temporary 
jobs will open soon including hiking trail builder grades i amp 
2 hiking boot polisher and spotted owl nest cleaner 
the government tuesday announced preliminary plans to restrict 
logging in the northwest to protect the rare northern spotted owl 
at the same time the government said it will try to balance the 
industrys needs against the owls 
but loggers at the waterhole tavern no 1 were skeptical 
they and others walking the main street of this onemill town of 
1200 said that in the end theyre going to suffer 
this industry has been in an uproar since the 1920s growled 
jim miller a logger miller and parttime bartender this 
spotted owl thing is just the latest setback for us 
miller and others said the industry already is feeling the 
effects of a weakened lumber products market as the nations 
housing starts decline 
substantial logging cutbacks in virgin or oldgrowth forest to 
protect owls would affect us drastically said simpson timber 
mill manager del orren the mill down the street from the tavern 
employs 350 people making doors for homes it relies exclusively on 
oldgrowth timber he said 
were feeling the pinch some he said any logging 
cutbacks are going to hurt 
the us fish and wildlife service said friday the spotted owl 
of which 3000 to 5000 pairs remain would be designated a 
threatened species july 23 the move cheered environmentalists who 
are seeking to protect not only the owl but the remaining 
centuriesold forests in washington oregon and northern california 
but the environmentalists want far more extensive restrictions 
on logging to protect the shy 2foottall owl than were announced 
tuesday a task force headed by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter is to devise a detailed plan by sept 1 
the preliminary plan will reduce logging on us bureau of land

a house subcommittee chairman says he is 
angered by president bushs refusal to get off the fence and 
find a way to save the northern spotted owl while still protecting 
logging jobs in the northwest 
rep bruce vento dminn contended wednesday that a lack of 
scientific credibility in the administrations preliminary plans to 
protect the threatened owl will force a court battle that will 
paralyze the regions logging industry unless congress steps in 
the president is leading us right down the road and into a 
legal disaster said vento chairman of the house interior 
subcommittee on national parks and public lands 
the administration is putting us right back in court right 
back into paralysis in that area he said 
the fish and wildlife service last friday declared the owl a 
threatened species it cited scientific evidence that current 
forest management practices are inadequate to reverse the shrinking 
habitat and declining population that jeopardize the owls survival 
an estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of the owls are believed to 
exist 
vento said he was most upset by agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutters decision tuesday to postpone an announcement on a 
solution to the problem and instead form a new timber task force 
that will report to bush by sept 1 on how many trees the forest 
service should cut next year 
the president ought to get off the fence instead of passing 
the buck to another blueribbon committee weve got enough blue 
ribbons around here to go to the state fair vento said 
we have got to have a reserved forest system we have got to 
take some land and preserve it 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr said tuesday that harvest 
reductions on bureau of land management lands will be much less 
than was feared as a result of owl protection 
yeutter said he will chair the new task force that will strive 
to maintain nearcurrent harvest levels in the pacific northwest 
forests inhabited by the 2foottall owl 
the announcements drew heated criticism from environmentalists 
who subscribe to the scientific report that suggests northwestern 
timber harvests must be cut nearly in half to ensure that the owl 
will not become extinct 
lujan said the blm will enact a plan on oct 1 that will reduce 
blm timber harvest levels in oregon and northern california from 
950 million board feet annually to 750 million board feet 
blm director cy jamison said the plan will save more owls but 
cause less economic disruption than would a plan offered in april 
by a panel of government scientists chaired by forest service 
biologist jack ward thomas 
jamisons plan would cost 1000 jobs over two years compared 
with the governments prediction that the thomas report would 
result in the loss of nearly 8000 logging jobs on blm lands by the 
end of the decade 
the thomas plan also is projected to cost more than 20000 jobs 
on forest service lands by the year 2000

a surprise supreme court decision upholding 
broadcast affirmative action rules should reinvigorate efforts to 
increase minority ownership of us radio and tv stations 
broadcasters say 
recent legal challenges to the federal communications commission 
rules had put a damper on attempts to expand minority broadcast 
ownership the broadcasters said following wednesdays 54 ruling 
james l winston executive director of the national association 
of blackowned broadcasters said the courts decision means the 
fccs ability to help promote minority ownership can now go forward 
without fear of constitutional challenge 
winston said blacks own 182 radio stations and 17 television 
stations compared with 30 radio stations and one tv station in 
1978 when the rules first were adopted the fcc said blacks now own 
35 percent of broadcast stations 
while this still is not at the level we would like to see 
we are pleased that the ability of the fcc to utilize policies to 
increase ownership will be allowed to continue and expand 
winston said 
fcc chairman alfred sikes said he was pleased that the cloud 
of doubt that has surrounded the commissions implementation of 
these policies has been dispelled 
lois wright vice president of inner city broadcasting corp in 
new york city said the rules had been working effectively and i 
think theyll work more effectively now 
these supreme court decisions have a direct impact she 
added once you theyre sustained youre likely to get more 
deals for wouldbe minority broadcasters 
wright said the fcc under sikes appears to be a better friend to 
the affirmative action rules than the fcc during the reagan 
administration 
andrew j schwartzman of the media access project a coalition 
of groups that had urged the court to uphold the fcc policies said 
he was surprised by the decision scrape me off the floor the 
supreme court has opened the door of opportunity for americas 
minorities he said 
the courts ruling covered two cases 
in a case from florida the justices allowed the commission to 
give special favorable consideration to hispanic minorities in 
deciding who would win a license for an orlando tv station 
in the other case involving a connecticut tv station the court 
upheld the commissions distresssale policy which lets a 
broadcaster faced with the loss of his license sell to a 
minorityowned business at 75 percent of the stations market 
value the ruling was a victory for a hispanicled company in 
hartford 
schwartzman said the ruling also lets the fcc continue its 
policy of giving preferential treatment to women seeking broadcast 
licenses 
although the court did not address the issue of womens rights 
fcc affirmative action policies treat women and minorities almost 
identically 
the ruling removes a threat to other federal affirmative action 
programs including those adopted by the transportation and defense 
departments and by the small business administration 
in its most important previous ruling on preferential minority 
treatment by the federal government a more liberal high court in 
1980 upheld a public works program that set aside a percentage of 
federal funds for minority contracts 
but more recently the court has cut back on affirmative action 
last year the justices struck down a richmond va program that 
set aside a percentage of local public works contracts for 
minorityowned businesses that ruling cast doubt on the validity 
of numerous similar plans of states and cities but had no bearing 
on federal programs 
in wednesdays ruling justice william j brennan wrote for the 
court that congressional approval of racial preferences shields 
such programs from the kind of challenge that could invalidate 
similar state and city plans 
it is of overriding significance in these cases that the fccs 
minority ownership programs have been specifically approved 
indeed mandated by congress he said 
but justice sandra day oconnor said the decision undermines the 
nations fundamental commitment to equal treatment for all 
americans justice anthony m kennedy said the ruling conjures up 
images of racial segregation 
also dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
antonin j scalia justices william brennan thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun byron r white and john paul stevens were the 
majority

the earthquake that devastated this town of 
40000 people has quadrupled the size of its main cemetery 
dozens of gravediggers in orange coveralls have buried between 
5000 and 6000 victims in trench graves an official at the 
cemetery said wednesday 
we are still pulling out bodies from the debris said the 
official who asked not to be identified about two acres have been 
added to the half acre of cemetery in the past week 
at first we had to bury some people in unmarked mass graves 
three deep because there were so many and it was so hot said the 
cemetery supervisor 
in the new graves 5inchthick white stones are set on end to 
form a low wall down the middle of the trench the victims are 
buried down each side of the trench about a foot apart 
a refrigerator truck carrying 67 shrouded bodies in ice waited 
next to two 100footlong trenches for relatives to arrive for 
funerals 
the official said it was difficult contacting the relatives and 
he was unsure how long it would be before the funerals took place 
the latest victims were so badly injured in the quake that they 
died after being hospitalized in qazvin about an hours drive to 
the southeast manjil is about 180 miles northwest of the capital 
tehran 
a worker sprayed disinfectant wednesday from tanks on the back 
of a pickup truck over the most recent trenches containing the 
graves of 70 people buried in the morning 
most of manjil one of the towns hardest hit when the quake

a house subcommittee approved a bill to place 
new cost and competition standards on the cable television industry 
amid warnings that irritated viewers are watching to see what 
congress will do about poor service and soaring prices 
rep jim cooper dtenn noted wednesday that cable tv is a 
consumer issue affecting 52 million viewers who are also voters 
the message was not lost on the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee as it approved by voice vote a 
bill designed to control prices for basic cable tv services and 
ensure competition 
a senate committee earlier this month gave nearunanimous 
approval to a similar measure 
rep matthew rinaldo rnj who helped subcommittee chairman 
edward markey dmass draft the compromise bill predicted the 
measure would pass the house this year 
he said he would urge president bush to sign the bill although 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher and justice department 
officials told the house they opposed the measure 
several subcommittee members promised to try to amend the bill 
later to allow telephone companies to compete with cable major 
floor fights are expected over that proposal in the house and 
senate 
congress in 1984 deregulated the cable tv industry but consumer 
complaints about poor service and high charges prompted 
introduction of bills to rein in an industry that rep john 
dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee calls an unregulated monopoly 
this is a very significant consumer victory gene kimmelman 
legislative director of the consumer federation of america said of 
the house bill if enacted it will finally bring cable rates 
down to reasonable levels and promote competition most usefully 
in rural america 
kimmelman has maintained that cable subscribers are paying twice 
what they should in the absence of effective competition 
the house bill he said could actually lead to rate rollbacks 
for the communities that have experienced extreme rate 
increases 
the cable tv industry condemned the bill 
we are very troubled by this bill said james mooney 
president of the national cable television association we do not 
support it 
mooney said many important issues remain to be resolved when 
the bill goes to the full energy and commerce committee 
provisions of the bill include requirements that 
cable systems provide a basic tier of local broadcast and 
public tv channels with the federal communications commission to 
decide on maximum rates for this tier pay channels such as home 
box office would not be regulated 
the fcc develop criteria to identify unreasonable or abusive 
rates for cableowned programs such as mtv and cnn the senate 
bill would allow fcc scrutiny only if a rate increase for these 
programs were challenged and if the rates were found to be 
significantly excessive 
programmers provide their signals for the backyard satellite 
dish industry and home satellite users 
the fcc study whether to limit the number of cable systems one 
company may own or limit cable operator ownership of programming

about 55 cubic miles of ice disappeared from a 
nevadasize section of the arctic over 11 years suggesting 
scientists should study the arctic more closely for signs of global 
warming a researcher reported today 
the 15 percent decline is large for an area where scientists had 
thought ice was consistently thick said researcher peter wadhams 
but it is impossible to know whether global warming played any 
role he said 
wadhams of the university of cambridge in england presented 
his arctic ice study in todays issue of the british journal nature 
scientists predict a gradual warming of the earth from a buildup 
of gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the gases trap 
solar energy like a greenhouse around the earth 
such a warming could lead to hotter summers altered rainfall 
patterns that could disrupt agriculture and flooding in coastal 
areas scientists say 
using data from submarinebased studies in 1976 and 1987 
wadhams calculated changes within a 112000squaremile triangle 
north of greenland that is slightly larger than nevada 
wadhams studied the thickness of the submerged portions of huge 
floating chunks of sea ice that is a good indicator of total ice 
thickness 
he found that average thickness dropped from 175 feet in 1976 
to 149 feet in 1987 about a 15 percent decrease over the study 
area that corresponds to a loss of nearly 55 cubic miles of ice 
he said 
the missing ice did not necessarily melt away the main reason 
for the decrease wadhams suggested may be that thick ice broke 
apart in the months before the 1987 reading that would leave open 
water that would freeze into relatively thin ice this would reduce 
the overall average thickness for the region he studied 
such a mechanism would have nothing to do with global warming 
john walsh a university of illinois meteorology professor said in 
an interview but other factors may have been at work too he said 
the jurys still out on this walsh said 
thinning of arctic ice can be an early sign of global warming 
wadhams wrote but it is impossible to tell whether global warming 
played any role in his findings because he lacks data from between 
the two years he sampled or from years since 1987 he said 
the findings show that scientists must do more extensive 
monitoring to determine if arctic ice is getting thinner or whether 
changes like the one he found are simply natural variations he 
said 
a nature editorial called the new results provocative and 
agreed that more studies will be needed to discern true trends in 
the ice thickness 
no data published so far can provide a reliable indication of 
whether the sea ice of the arctic basin is thinning thickening or 
remaining essentially constant wrote alfred mclaren and roger 
barry of the university of colorado at boulder and rh bourke of 
the naval postgraduate school in monterey calif 
mclaren in an interview said he believes wadhams results were 
due to natural variations in weather i think thats all we can 
say right now until we know more he said

a consumer advocacy group today released a 
nationwide compendium that identifies nearly 7000 medical 
professionals who have been disciplined by state and federal 
agencies 
the roster two inches thick and titled 6892 questionable 
doctors lists actions taken against physicians dentists 
chiropractors and podiatrists in 40 states and the district of 
columbia 
if your doctor is among the 6892 on this list you ought at 
least to question the quality of his or her care at the very 
minimum you should find out why dr sidney wolfe director of 
the public citizen health research group said in a statement 
released with the compilation 
although the nations system for protecting the public from 
incompetent physicians has vastly improved in the past 15 
years it is still inadequate said the group founded by consumer 
activist ralph nader 
gaps the size of the grand canyon may have shrunk to texas 
arroyos desert streambeds but they still snake everywhere across 
the landscape the groups report said 
and those dangerous doctors who fall through the cracks 
continue to kill maim defraud and otherwise injure their 
unknowing patients 
the statebystate consumer guide contains the names of doctors 
who have been disciplined by state medical boards medicare or the 
federal drug enforcement administration 
also each states section lists names of doctors who have 
addresses in that state and were disciplined by medical boards in 
other states it also contains the reason for the action where 
available 
public citizen said its compendium is the first such nationwide 
roster available to the public 
the federal government is preparing to open a national 
practitioner data bank listing information on state disciplinary 
actions malpractice payments and revocation of hospital privileges 
however public citizen has complained that this information 
will not be available to the public it will be accessible 
primarily to hospitals health maintenance organizations and 
government agencies 
public citizen asked state medical boards and federal agencies 
for actions taken against doctors since 1985 some states provided 
actions that went back even further while others provided data for 
only the last year or two 
still others didnt provide any information at all 
state medical boards in alabama alaska colorado oklahoma and 
south dakota adamantly refused to provide the requested data 
public citizen said 
five other states arizona arkansas maine mississippi and 
new mexico were willing to provide at least some information but 
for various reasons did not public citizen said

candidates plotting strategy for the 
1992 presidential race shouldnt make plans quite yet to trade the 
snows of iowa and new hampshire for california sunshine 
the nations most populous state may not shift its presidential 
primary after all 
four months ago california was on the brink of shaking up the 
presidential nomination system by making its primary one of the 
earliest in the country 
a bill to move the presidential primary from early june to the 
first tuesday in march had passed both houses of the legislature in 
different forms 
some supporters were predicting that delegaterich california 
would overshadow iowa and new hampshire and become the first major 
stop on the campaign trail for presidential hopefuls 
if youre a candidate running for president do you want to be 
trudging around in the snow or do you want to be in california 
asked assemblyman mike roos a los angeles democrat 
but the early primary bill has been languishing in a twohouse 
conference committee since late february the delay is blamed on a 
dispute over when the state should hold its primary for state and 
congressional candidates and by the press of other business 
senate president pro tem david roberti a los angeles democrat 
said the bill has bogged down partly because everybody is 
suspicious that the other side is trying to get a partisan 
advantage 
he gives the legislation a 5050 chance of becoming law 
most legislators agree that the state should hold an earlier 
presidential primary the june primary is one of the latest in the 
nation meaning that presidential nominations usually are wrapped 
up by the time californians vote 
california voters have not played a key role in a nomination 
battle since 1972 when george mcgovern defeated hubert humphrey in 
california and went on to win the democratic nomination 
if the early primary had been in effect in 1988 californians 
would have voted three weeks instead of four months after the 
new hampshire primary giving themselves a big voice in determining 
the republican and democratic nominees 
debate on the legislation has focused on whether the state and 
congressional primary should still be held on the same day as the 
presidential primary 
under the proposed legislation the state would continue to hold 
one primary in march in presidential election years and in june 
in nonpresidential years 
democratic leaders support that approach saying that otherwise 
voter turnout would drop off for state and congressional races 
but senate republican leader ken maddy said members of his 
caucus wont support a consolidated march primary they fear that 
new legislative districts drawn to reflect the 1990 census might 
not be in place in time for march 1992 and the current legislative 
districts favor democrats 
republican leaders want a march presidential primary and a state 
and congressional primary in september saying that would reduce 
spending for legislative and congressional races 
aides to the bills chief author democratic assemblyman jim 
costa say the conference committee may not meet on the dispute 
until august 
democrats control both houses of the legislature and could pass 
the legislation by themselves but without substantial gop support 
they could face a veto by republican gov george deukmejian that 
they couldnt override 
the governor has his signature and i dont think the governor 
would do something thats opposed by a significant number of 
republicans roberti said

firsttime home buyers seeking federally 
backed mortgages would pay more money and need larger down 
payments under legislation approved by the senate 
the bill also authorizes a 3 billion increase in government 
spending on housing programs next year it was approved by a 961 
vote wednesday night with only sen william roth rdel objecting 
the measure also would extend for two years the 124875 ceiling 
on fhainsured mortgages that congress last year raised from 
101250 in most highcost areas 
housing secretary jack kemp joined senate sponsors earlier 
wednesday in announcing a bipartisan agreement on key elements of 
the bill which represents the biggest revamping of federal housing 
policies since 1968 
senate banking committee chairman don riegle dmich said the 
bill charts a way out of a decadelong slide that has left 2 
million americans homeless 
in the 1980s twothirds of the families poor enough to get 
federal help with housing got none at all riegle said and 
after 35 years of rising steadily home ownership plummeted in each 
of the last 10 years 
but private lenders vowed immediately to oppose the senate 
changes in the federal housing administration mortgage insurance 
program when the issue reaches the house floor after congress july 
4 recess 
the compromise effectively closes the door to home ownership 
for thousands of american families said warren lasko head of 
the mortgage bankers association of america 
home buyers with fhabacked loans would have to have at least a 
5 percent down payment and would be required to pay at least 
twothirds of closing costs up front without financing loans with 
low down payments deemed most at risk to default would be subject 
to an added annual fee 
under the compromise according to lawmakers the up front costs 
to a young family in a typical case buying their first home 
with an fhainsured mortgage would rise from 3500 to 4400 
borrowers currently can finance all closing costs sometimes 
resulting in loans greater than the value of the home on 
fhabacked mortgages 
lasko estimated that 75000 to 150000 firsttime home buyers 
would be closed out of fhabacked loans he called the change the 
result of an overreaction to the savings and loan scandal 
the fha insurance program lost 42 billion to bad loans in 
1988 and its net worth has declined from 8 billion to 26 
billion over the past decade 
auditors have warned that without at least an annual 4 percent 
increase in housing values the mortgage insurance fund could 
require a massive infusion of taxpayer funds to remain solvent 
just like the savings and loan bailout 
sen alan cranston dcalif a principal sponsor of the housing 
bill had opposed changing the fha rules last week but agreed to 
them in exchange to the administration dropping its opposition to a 
3 billion increase in federal spending on housing 
as passed the legislation would authorize 181 billion in 
spending in fiscal 1991 195 billion in 1992 and 21 billion in 
1993 compared with the 145 billion being spent this year 
in exchange for the new funds kemps socalled homeownership 
opportunity for people everywhere program to encourage tenant 
purchase of public housing units would get 19 billion over the 
next three years 
kemp said the administration supported the greater spending 
despite budget constraints that prompted bush a day earlier to 
swallow his notaxincrease pledge but he noted the final amount 
will depend on budget talks 
under the agreement senate democrats also get their housing 
opportunity program which consolidates 10 existing housing 
programs funneling federal dollars to local governments for 
renovating or building housing 
democrats agreed to allow part of that money to be spent on 
vouchers for the poor to use for rental housing despite the 
senates rejection of a similar amendment last week

the issue of who pays for the savings and loan 
bailout is dividing congress along regional lines 
as the high price tag hits home northeastern lawmakers who have 
already agreed to the bailout are voicing resentment that so much 
of their constituents money is flowing to the sun belt 
that resentment is threatening to spill over into other spending 
issues from housing to water projects to farm programs 
the first winds of this regional storm swept over the senate on 
wednesday as legislators from the northeast and midwest angrily 
challenged a move by sen phil gramm rtexas to shift federal 
housing grants to the populous sun belt states 
gramms bid fizzled but not before senators exchanged heated 
words for more than two hours on the senate floor 
this amendment has the possibilities of creating enormous 
regional animosities of tearing us apart at a time when we need to 
be coming together said sen john kerry dmass 
by turning the sampl issue into a regional fight the debate was 
significant in that it cut across party lines pundits and 
politicians have been predicting that the thrift crisis would 
become a major campaign issue but the floor debate had members of 
both parties line up on opposite sides 
kerry said gramms proposal reflected an insatiable appetite for 
federal tax dollars the bailout was a disaster with many villains 
kerry said and it was a necessary solution 
were willing to do that its been done we accept it he 
said of the bailout but apparently it isnt enough 
kerry spoke ominously of a farm bill about to come to the senate 
floor the bill with goodies galore for western and southern 
farm states may have trouble getting through the senate he warned 
if gramm and others move to tilt other federal programs in favor 
of the sunbelt kerry said the repercussions are going to play 
out as we debate the farm bill 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny got into the fray by 
threatening to block a water resources development bill which 
contains a substantial amount of money for texas moynihan chairs a 
senate subcommittee that is handling the bill 
and sen alfonse damato rny challenged gramm by offering 
his own amendment to the housing legislation damatos proposal 
would have required texas and other states with high sampl failure 
rates to give up housing money in proportion to the bailout dollars 
they were receiving 
damato argued that lax state regulations in texas led to the 
sampl slide new york taxpayers meanwhile were being asked to pay 
for a sizable portion of the bailout 
the state of new york is on the hook for 173 billion to 
clean up a problem that its citizens did not cause and who will 
receive no benefit from its solution damato said 
gramm shot back that the sampl bailout money wasnt being poured 
into the coffers of the state of texas or the bank accounts of its 
citizens rather he said it was paying back insured depositors 
many of them highroller investors from the northeast 
he called the idea of using trumpedup amendments based on the 
sampl bailout a cute and clever tactic 
to in any way equate the sampl bailout with a formula for 
allocating community development block grant funds a formula that 
in its current incarnation is absolutely unfair is just 
outrageous gramm said im not trying to beat a regional horse 
here 
damato admitted that his amendment was more of a symbolic 
gesture than a serious effort at legislation but he said it 
reflected genuine anger

americans under age 30 know less about whats 
going on in the country and the world than any other generation in 
the past 50 years according to a study of how people keep up with 
the news 
it found that americans aged 1830 are less likely than earlier 
generations to have read a newspaper or watched a television news 
show twentyfive years ago 67 percent of people under age 35 said 
yes when asked if they had read a newspaper yesterday now 
only 24 percent say yes 
television newswatching has dropped too young people who said 
they watched the tv news yesterday fell from 52 percent in 1965 
to 41 percent this year 
the study said that from 1941 to 1975 young americans were on a 
par with their elders in public knowledge and in following most 
major news events closely but since 1975 young people have been 
less attentive and the trend is accelerating it said 
the information age has spawned an uninformed and 
uninvolved population concludes the study it was conducted by 
the times mirror center for the people and the press sponsored by 
the company which publishes the los angeles times the centers own 
polls and those of four other polling organizations taken over the 
years were analyzed

a money shortage that could force 240000 
lowincome women and children out of a government nutrition program 
is not an emergency an administration official says 
meanwhile a bill that will help states get more money for the 
supplemental food program for women infants and children or wic 
was moving quickly through the house 
the house education and labor committee approved a measure by 
rep tony hall dohio to let states borrow a greater amount of 
next years wic appropriation to cover current shortages hall 
introduced the bill monday and a vote on the house floor could 
occur thursday officials said 
house members criticized the department of agriculture which 
administers wic for not seeking more money for the program which 
has been battered in at least 20 states by food price increases and 
rebate reductions 
its an absolute outrage said rep john bryant dtexas 
why isnt the administration up here urging an emergency 
supplemental appropriations bill 
this program faces a dire crisis said rep barbara boxer 
dcalif who chaired a hearing on wic by the house budget 
committees task force on human resources 
betty jo nelsen administrator of the usdas food and nutrition 
service said 11 million was being reallocated this week to make 
up for spending or budget shortfalls in some states 
it will clearly not be enough ms nelsen said but when 
pressed by task force members she refused to call the funding 
shortage an emergency 
i would characterize it as a very difficult situation ms 
nelsen said i would save severe crisis or emergency for when we

drug used to treat high blood pressure after the food and drug 
administration alleged the company submitted false information to 
the agency 
interpharm inc of plainview ny agreed wednesday to recall 
all three strengths of clonidine hydrochloride tablets from 
distributors and pharmacies and to conduct an audit of its 24 other 
products the fda said 
the drug comes in small round blue tablets marked ip 47 
routine testing by the fda found that samples of clonidine 
hydrochloride 03 milligram tablets submitted for bioequivalence 
testing by interpharm were not the same as the product on the 
market the agency said 
the tablets interpharm was marketing were blue and in its 
application for approval the company told the fda its tablets were 
blue but the pills that were tested for bioequivalence before the 
drug was approved were peachcolored the fda said 
the agency said it found no manufacturing or production data 
that indicated the company had ever made any peachcolored pills 
the fda said it had no evidence of a safety problem with the 
drug interpharm was marketing but questions whether the product is 
therapeutically equivalent to the brand name drug catapres made 
by boehringer ingelheim

abortion services are getting harder to find 
in rural parts of the country and in some areas women have to 
travel hundreds of miles to a provider a report by the alan 
guttmacher institute said wednesday 
nearly all of the nearly 16 million abortions performed in 1988 
were performed in metropolitan areas about 17 percent a total 
of 27000 took place in rural areas according to the survey by 
the independent nonprofit research group 
in 1979 when 15 million abortions were performed in this 
country about 45 percent of them around 67000 were in rural 
facilities 
as the concentration of abortion services has continued to shift 
from hospitals to specialized clinics women in rural areas have 
been hit hardest those women usually have had to rely on hospitals 
for abortion services since small clinics often are not economical 
in rural areas the report said 
our findings clearly show that access to abortion which was 
already a tremendous problem for women living outside of the 
metropolitan areas of our country is getting worse even without 
additional state restrictions that may result from any new 
legislative activity stanley henshaw author of the report said

after nine years of civil 
war that claimed about 30000 lives nicaragua is finally at peace 
i feel proud and happy as a nicaraguan woman and mother 
because the boys have turned over their arms so nicaragua can live

after a ceremony in which top contra rebel leaders gave up their 
weapons 
were going to disarm everyone peacefully without hate and 
without resentment she said 
during the ceremony formally ending the war about 100 rebel

the disarmament and voluntary resettlement of the contras 
today the war ends presidential spokesman danilo lacayo 
said 
shortly after the ceremony 14 people most of them journalists 
were seriously injured when two helicopters carrying them back to 
managua collided during takeoff 
the contra commanders were led by israel galeano who had turned 
over a first batch of weapons including 62 usmade red eye 
missiles to the head of the unoas force gen agustin quesada 
we hope this signifies that peace will endure in nicaragua 
galeano told the spanish general 
it is an honor to say to the nicaraguan people mission 
accomplished the struggle has been to establish a government of 
laws in this country galeano said handing over his own rifle 
the contras who were trained and supported by the united 
states claim credit for forcing the former sandinista government 
to call the feb 25 election that mrs chamorro won 
after losing the election the sandinistas allegedly distributed 
tens of thousands of automatic weapons to civilian supporters 
urging them to defend the conquests of the sandinista 
revolution 
mrs chamorro pledged during wednesdays ceremony to ask local 
officials nationwide to tell me in writing where sandinista 
arms caches are hidden 
the contras had cited the arming of the civilian population of 
this nation of 36 million people when they missed several previous 
deadlines to disarm 
they finally began turning in their weapons on may 8 two weeks 
after the sandinistas handed over power to mrs chamorro 
un officials now say that only about 1000 members of the once 
18000strong rebel force still have their guns 
he gave up the first batch of missiles on tuesday in the town of 
el amendro 190 miles southeast of managua in rio san juan 
province where the contras have been promised land on which to 
settle 
he said the united states had given the contras more than 100 of 
the red eye missiles in the last four years of the war he claimed 
the rebels had downed 35 government aircraft with them 
the war which was accompanied by harsh us economic sanctions 
that helped bring the nicaraguan economy to a virtual standstill 
is seen as the key factor behind sandinista leader daniel ortegas 
stunning electoral loss 
although a ceasefire has been in place since early 1988 
sporadic combat and the hated military draft continued along 
with us economic pressure 
washington lifted the sanctions after mrs chamorros victory 
and sent nicaragua 300 million in badly needed foreign aid 
mrs chamorro abolished the draft on april 25 the day she took 
office she later announced plans to reduce to army to half its 
current strength of more than 90000 
nicaragua had amassed central americas largest armed force with 
huge infusions of aid from the soviet union and its allies

the national assemblys 
president says one of his police escorts was hit by gunfire in an 
attack he blamed on leftist rebels who have recently promised not 
to attack civilian officials 
the rightist politician ricardo alvarenga said no one was 
injured there was no immediate rebel comment on the reported 
attack wednesday night 
alvarenga told a news conference he was driving his pickup truck 
home from the legislature when the police car traveling in front of 
him was struck by several bullets he said he accelerated to escape 
the lawmaker a member of the governing republican national 
alliance arena said another vehicle following his and carrying 
bodyguards was also struck by gunfire 
alvarenga blamed the attack on the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front which has for 10 years fought a 
succession of usbacked governments 
the rebels who are discussing peace with government 
representatives in monthly meetings said in a communique earlier 
this year they would refrain from attacking civilian government 
officials 
on wednesday a judge issued an arrest warrant for an army 
officer accused of destroying evidence in the november massacre of 
six jesuit priests their cook and her teenage daughter 
the government is under pressure from the rebels to resolve the 
jesuit case the rebels demanded army officers be made accountable 
for rights abuses at the latest round of peace talks that ended 
this week in mexico 
the warrant was issued after widespread criticism of the 
investigation into the massacre by a us congressional committee 
and leaders of el salvadors roman catholic church 
the charges accuse lt col carlos camilo hernandez of 
destroying the mission logs of troops accused in the shootings at 
central american university 
hernandez an executive officer of the elite belloso battalion 
in san salvador is the former assistant director of the military 
college where the troops were stationed 
the warrant was issued by judge ricardo zamora who is handling 
the politically charged investigation it asks military officials 
to arrest hernandez and hand him over to the civilian court for 
prosecution 
neither the armed forces press office nor the us embassy would 
comment on the latest development in the jesuit case 
defense attorney joaquin barahona said the judge based his 
warrant on the testimony of several witnesses as well as statements 
by hernandez himself 
hernandez is the 10th person charged in the case 
the director of the military college col guillermo benavides 
three lieutenants and five enlisted men have been charged with the 
slayings 
no salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human 
rights crime despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at 
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces or president 
alfredo cristianis arena party 
to date the only evidence presented against benavides has been 
that of other defendants which is not admissible in salvadoran 
courts however a key military witness appeared before the judge 
wednesday in a closed hearing 
col carlos armando aviles who reportedly blew the case open by 
telling a us military adviser who was responsible for the 
slayings arrived wednesday in el salvador from taiwan where he 
had been sent for military training after the jesuit massacre 
aviles is a key witness a defense lawyer requesting 
anonymity told the associated press if he testifies to what he 
has said unofficially it will be overwhelming evidence against the 
defendants 
asked about the latest developments in the jesuit case at a news 
conference wednesday cristiani would only comment if the judge 
thinks he has proof he should proceed according to the law 
the massacre took place during a huge offensive by leftist 
rebels army positions at the college had come under fire several 
times 
the six priests and educators their housekeeper and her 
15yearold daughter were roused from their sleep before dawn nov 
16 and killed by troops of the elite atlacatl infantry battalion 
two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said benavides 
issued an order to kill the priests 
the investigation has moved slowly and there have been reports 
that crucial evidence has been destroyed that military witnesses 
have been given assignments abroad to keep them from testifying 
and that the true masterminds of the slayings were being protected 
the farright considered the leftleaning jesuit academics 
subversive because they blamed social injustice rather than 
international communist expansion for el salvadors revolution 
the murders provoked an international outcry and calls from some 
quarters in the us congress for sharp cuts in aid to el salvador 
the largest recipient of us aid in the hemisphere

the withdrawal of peace corps 
volunteers highlights the vulnerability of the estimated 140000 
americans in this country as they become steadily drawn into its 
21yearold communist insurgency 
us officials announced wednesday that they were suspending 
peace corps operations in the philippines and sending the 261 
volunteers home because of intelligence reports that communist 
rebels planned to kill or kidnap them 
volunteers were to begin leaving by commercial flights after 
president corazon aquino invited them to an emotional farewell 
ceremony at the malacanang presidential palace 
many in the group wept as volunteer kim rylander of denison 
texas told the president she regretted leaving the philippines 
because i left my heart here 
mrs aquino promised the volunteers to investigate the threats 
against the peace corps which has assigned volunteers to the 
philippines for nearly 29 years she said she hoped washington 
will reassess the situation and allow volunteers to return 
american officials refuse to elaborate on the reported rebel 
threat but the decision to evacuate volunteers shows that us 
diplomats take it seriously 
that represents a dramatic shift in us perceptions of american 
vulnerability in the marxist insurgency for years it had been 
widely assumed that americans were somehow invulnerable to 
systematic rebel attack 
but since april 1989 eight americans including six affiliated 
with the us military are believed to have been slain by the new 
peoples army the armed wing of the outlawed communist party of 
the philippines 
last month the rebels claimed responsibility for killing two 
american airmen outside the usrun clark air base and vowed more 
assassinations until all us troops leave the country 
in reaction the us military scaled down an exercise 
restricted movement of its personnel and even offered to ship 
soldiers families back home free of charge the actions were all 
in reaction to the rebel threat 
a senior american official speaking on condition of anonymity 
insisted that the decision to suspend peace corps operations did 
not mean the rebels were gaining strength or that washington was 
losing confidence in mrs aquino 
instead the official said the rebels were resorting to 
terrorism because the armed forces of the philippines was slowly 
winning the war 
the american official said recent security precautions had 
prevented the rebels from killing senior us diplomats or military 
officers and that the guerrillas are now aiming to hit soft 
targets such as peace corps volunteers 
the official said it was better to remove the volunteers based 
on a single intelligence report rather than risk having a single 
volunteer killed or kidnapped 
but if that be the case how will the united states respond if 
the new peoples army further expands its target list to include 
american businessmen and other civilians 
according to the us embassy there are up to 140000 americans 
in the philippines including about 40000 affiliated with the 
military protecting all of them is impossible 
us officials acknowledge that the rebels are targeting us 
government employees and troops but insist there is no sign that 
civilians are at risk 
last week however philippine military sources said captured 
rebel documents indicate the guerrillas plan to step up attacks on 
foreigners in the next six months 
the first americans slain in the insurgency were three naval 
officers killed in a 1974 ambush near the subic bay naval base 
after that rebels avoided targeting americans for more than 12 
years though many of the villages around the sprawling usrun 
clark air base are longtime new peoples army strongholds 
that changed in october 1987 when rebels killed three americans 
in coordinated attacks outside clark 50 miles north of manila 
us officials believe the attacks were ordered after american 
ambulances evacuated philippine soldiers wounded in a rebel ambush 
in april 1989 rebels killed us army col james nick rowe 
in an ambush in suburban quezon city since then seven other 
americans are believed to have been slain by the rebels 
by all signs the rebels have steadily become less selective in 
their targets 
in public statements the rebels claim american civilians are 
not at risk if they avoid involvement in the governments 
counterinsurgency rebel sources say they are after quality 
targets such as senior diplomats and military officers 
but except for rowe all americans slain by the rebels since 
1987 were either military enlisted men or civilians without 
important posts the two airmen killed last month were on temporary 
duty in the philippines and apparently picked for assassination at 
random 
last month the state department cautioned americans to be 
careful traveling in the philippines but they have not been told 
to stay away or leave 
the us official insisted that americans were safe in manila 
and major tourist destinations if they exercise routine precautions 
but within the past month the guerrillas have killed several 
filipino soldiers including a colonel in broad daylight on major 
streets in the capital

to death 
three of the policemen shot to death wednesday were killed on 
the streets of the northwestern city of medellin headquarters of 
the worlds largest cocaine gang a spokesman with the city police 
department said by telephone 
the other four policemen were killed in the town of dorada 
about 75 miles north of the capital of bogota they were in a 
patrol car when gunmen in a passing car opened fire with submachine 
guns and pistols police said in a news release carried by the 
radio network caracol 
the medellin cartel has unleashed a bloodbath against colombian 
policemen especially in medellin including wednesdays deaths 
132 policemen have been killed in the city this year 
the cartel has said it will pay about 4300 for each policeman 
killed in colombia drug traffickers and government security forces 
have been locked in a deadly war since the slaying last august of a 
presidential candidate who advocated extradition of drug suspects 
to the united states 
also wednesday police in medellin deactivated a car bomb 
comprised of 1000 pounds of dynamite the police spokesman said 
the dynamite was in a taxi and was armed with a fuse and 
detonators the policeman said the taxi was in a parking lot only 
about a halfblock from the city governments administrative office 
building 
it was the second car bomb deactivated in medellin in a week 
the judge who was killed 29yearold samuel alfonso rodriguez 
was driving a car accompanied by his wife when he was shot to death 
in the northeastern city of bucaramanga police said in a 
communique broadcast by the rcn radio network 
he was the fifth judge killed since the government crackdown on 
drug traffickers began on aug 18 
in the last 10 months the traffickers have responded to the 
crackdown with 283 terrorist acts including one that brought down 
a domestic airliner that have killed 274 people

the controversial french abortion pill has won 
backing from the american medical association the nations largest 
doctors association 
in a voice vote wednesday the amas 436member policymaking 
house of delegates endorsed testing and possible use of the ru486 
abortion pill 
the abortion issue pro and con should not interfere with our 
ability to conduct all kinds of investigations for all kinds of 
problems said dr charles sherman chairman of the ama committee 
that recommended support for the pill 
the pill is not available in the united states and no us 
companies have applied for food and drug administration approval to 
market it in this country because doctors say they fear running 
afoul of the antiabortion movement 
some doctors in the ama whose 290000 members account for about 
45 percent of the nations physicians said the pill appears safer 
and cheaper than surgical abortion and may be useful in treating 
brain tumors breast cancer and other illnesses 
a leading abortion opponent attacked the ama action 
i think it is outrageous for doctors to be thinking up better 
ways for killing their little patients john willke president of 
national right to life said in a telephone interview from his 
washington office 
some doctors taking part in amas annual policymaking session 
this week also said they feared the pill being distributed on the 
black market 
the director of the reproductive health technologies project a 
coalition of abortion rights family planning and womens health 
groups welcomed the ama move 
its extremely important that the ama representing the 
mainstream medical community in the country has spoken out 
marie bass said from washington 
the drug causes the uterus to shed its lining as occurs in 
menstruation and expel a fertilized egg 
ru486 or mifepristone was developed in 1980 by the french 
pharmaceutical company roussel uclaf and approved for use there in 
september 1988 
the following month roussel uclaf pulled ru486 off the market 
because antiabortion advocates boycotted the companys products 
two days later the french government a minority owner of the 
company ordered it to resume marketing 
since then the antiabortion movement has inhibited the company 
from distributing the drug for testing outside of france doctors 
said 
they said their action was an attempt to counter that 
ama doctors said ru486 might be effective in treating 
meningiomas which are types of brain tumors breast cancer 
gynecological malignancies and cushings syndrome which can induce 
high blood pressure obesity and diabetes 
in other business at the ama convention the house of delegates 
on approved a model plan for mandatory employercovered health 
insurance 
the package would cost an average of 1700 a year per employee 
against the current national average of 2300 to 2600 
the ama also rejected a proposal to censor editorials in the 
journal of the american medical association the illinois state 
medical society angered by several editorials critical of doctors 
had suggested a panel review such material 
the association also inaugurated c john tupper elected last 
year as its new president tupper an internist from davis 
calif succeeds alan r nelson of salt lake city

a decade ago communist leaders 
harbored the elusive international terrorist carlos who 
masterminded deadly attacks in western europe and is still at 
large the new government says 
interior minister balasz horvath said wednesday that after 
incriminating documents were found he ordered an investigation into 
the former communist regimes having provided terrorists with safe 
haven 
three former communist officials named by horvath former 
interior minister andras benkei former president karoly nemeth and 
highranking party official antal gyenes have denied any 
knowledge of or role in sheltering terrorists 
horvath said that chief among the terrorists was ilich ramirez 
sanchez alias carlos who masterminded a 1975 attack on an opec 
meeting in vienna that killed three people and 1984 bombings in 
marseille france that killed five 
the development follows arrests this month in east germany of 
leftist terrorist suspects who officials say were given new 
identities and allowed to live there while the communists were in 
power 
unlike other eastern european countries where communists were 
removed from power in hungary no communist leader has been 
arrested or charged in connection with activities during 45 years 
of communist rule which ended with free elections in april 
horvath said it was obviously a political decision to let 
these people terrorists come and stay in hungary 
it remains to be proved that they were undergoing training 
here but the inventory seems to point in a certain direction he 
told reporters he did not elaborate 
horvath said the deputy national police chief andras turos 
came to him with the information over the weekend 
he said the government documents included a 1979 interior 
ministry report on the arrival of carlos and his group and a 1980 
ministry report saying the terrorists had left behind explosives 
guns rockets and rocket launchers 
horvath said it is not known where the group obtained these 
items 
he said a 1980 letter from carlos to former longtime communist 
party leader janos kadar thanked kadar for allowing the group to 
use hungary as a base 
kadar stepped down in may 1988 and was replaced by communist 
reformer karoly grosz 
benkei the exinterior minister was quoted by the nepszabadsag 
newspaper on wednesday as saying this must be a 
misunderstanding i did not deal with such matters i retired in 
1980 hiding people nonsense lies 
nepszabadsag a former communist party paper reported that 
carlos and his associates were indeed in hungary in those years 
citing a wellinformed but unnamed source the paper stated 
that a very small circle of leaders knew about the authorization 
and their stay was safeguarded by state security organs 
according to the information we have their stay was not 
linked to any terrorist action but was to provide the terrorists 
rest and recreation nepszabadsag reported 
another budapest daily magyar hirlap said wednesday that there 
had been a terrorist training camp at csopak on the northern shore 
of lake balaton but provided no further information 
horvath told reporters that there has been no evidence uncovered 
so far that carlos and his group were in csopak 
carlos a venezuelan sometimes called the jackal headed 
interpols mostwanted list in 1975 
the son of a wealthy communist lawyer carlos has been linked 
with a bombing dec 31 1984 in marseille that killed five people 
and wounded 41 
he is also accused of plotting the 1975 hijacking of an air 
france jetliner to uganda that ended with the israeli commando raid 
at entebbe airport and the kidnapping of 11 opec oil ministers in 
vienna in which three people were killed

the dollar strengthened today as dealers continued 
to study the repercussions of president bushs recent reversal on 
new taxes 
dealers felt that while higher us taxes will help solve the 
countrys budget deficit and encourage lower interest rates there 
is little sign that the federal reserve is likely to lower rates 
soon 
some traders thought new taxes would lead to a weaker dollar 
others said a lower us budget deficit combined with a shrinking 
trade deficit would boost confidence in the us economy and 
ultimately produce a firmer dollar 
the dollar weakened in europe on tuesday in the immediate 
aftermath of bushs remarks on taxes but recovered most of its 
losses during wednesday morning trading

beating a court deadline by three hours los 
angeles countys board of supervisors redrew one of its voting 
districts to make it roughly half hispanic 
the plan adopted 32 wednesday was prompted by a federal 
judges ruling june 4 that the board had illegally kept hispanics 
from getting elected by redrawing the boundaries in 1981 to spread 
their numbers across several districts 
us district judge david kenyon had imposed a deadline of 3 
pm wednesday to correct the violations of the federal voting 
rights act he will consider the plan on july 5 
the supervisors drew the new boundaries by carving up supervisor 
ed edelmans district 
edelman condemned the plan and predicted the judge would reject 
it he said the proposed district is only 46 percent registered 
hispanic voters shy of the more than 50 percent demanded by the 
judge 
supporters of the plan said they hoped the judge would consider 
the socalled push factor the assumption that there are more 
votingage people in an area than have actually registered 
kenyons ruling followed a lawsuit by the us justice 
department the american civil liberties union and the mexican 
american legal defense and educational fund they contended the 
board had illegally diluted hispanic voting strength 
hispanics make up about 35 percent of the countys 87 million 
people but no hispanic has been elected to the board since 1875 
the judge has said that if the board fails to correct violations 
of the voting rights act he will redraw the district 
the mexicanamerican group refused immediate comment on the 
redistricting plan

soldiers wearing masks and civilian 
clothes opened fire today on the funeral procession for a slain 
communist rebel killing two mourners they also arrested 21 
people police said 
the shooting came shortly before president corazon aquino told 
departing us peace corps volunteers that her government would 
never allow the disciples and supporters of violence to achieve 
victory 
she was referring to communist rebels who allegedly planned to 
kill peace corps volunteers forcing us officials to suspend the 
groups operations in the philippines and order staffers home

cemetery with the body of benjamin tabuena 42 a former member of 
a rebel assassination squad when at least five gunmen in civilian 
clothes ordered pallbearers to stop and lie face down

tried to run but were shot and killed as the shooting erupted 
mourners scurried for cover 
some gunmen seized film and cameras from news photographers at 
gunpoint tabuena later was buried by cemetery workers on orders 
from the gunmen 
it was like an ambush said one witness who asked that his 
name be withheld to prevent reprisals 
after the shooting stopped the masked gunmen rounded up male 
mourners searched them at gunpoint and hustled them away 
capt arsenio pinacate spokesman for the militarys capital 
command said the gunmen were soldiers on an authorized mission to 
arrest rebels he did not explain why they wore masks and civilian 
clothing 
pinacate quoted lt col george alino commander of the capital 
command northern sector as saying the troops fired after suspected 
rebels resisted arrest but did not elaborate 
pinacate said mourners were arrested after they waived 
subversive placards during the funeral march 
a policeman at a nearby precinct said two capital command 
officers brought 21 people alleged to be rebels to the station the 
policeman would not give his name 
tabuena was a member of the alex boncayao brigade the manila

on the sixth night of the nineday jvc jazz 
festival a program featuring american song proved to be a 
pleasant offbeat event 
compared to some of the festivals overamplified concerts in 
larger halls the town hall theater off times square had the 
feeling of a small nightclub the place the players the audience 
all combined for a thoroughly enjoyable wednesday evening of jazz 
first came barbara lea a graceful singer whose enunciation and 
phrasing were impeccable despite a balky microphone she gave the 
evening a romantic touch with some vincent youmans standards 
among them i want to be happy and time on my hands from 
the 1920s and 1930s deftly accompanying her were the keith ingham 
trio dick sudhalter on trumpet and flugelhorn provided some apt 
punctuation 
next the evenings odd couple the scholarly dick hyman on piano 
and the streetsmart ruby braff on cornet but what lovely music 
they made first some selections from alan jay lerners and 
frederick loewes my fair lady then a fats waller stride piece 
hand full of keys hymans solo performance of blue skies 
made that classic new they finished up with if i could be with 
you one hour tonight 
gerry mulligan and his quartet distinguished themselves after 
intermission and sent the crowd murmuring with pleasure into the 
warm night 
saxophonist mulligan sang only one song i never was a young 
man and that largely without a microphone but his instrumental 
songs were highly satisfying among them a brazilianaccented a 
gift for dizzy and a tender song for strayhorn 
an evening of american song as the program was named 
deserves a rerun it showcased some solid performers and charmed 
several generations of jazzlovers in the audience

three early oil paintings by 19th 
century dutch master vincent van gogh have been stolen from a small 
provincial museum in this southern town the third theft in two 
years of van gogh works 
the paintings taken wednesday night from the noordbrabants 
museum were identified by the museum as the sitting farmers 
wife the digging farmers wife and wheels of the water 
mill in gennep 
guy jennings an impressionism expert at christies auction 
house in london said by telephone that such minor works by van 
gogh are worth about 1 million each but would be virtually 
impossible to sell on the open market 
peter veenland a member of the museums board of directors 
confirmed the theft of the paintings the museums only three works 
by the painter 
dutch radio quoted police as saying the paintings were stolen 
from the museum 55 miles south of amsterdam after entry was 
apparently gained through a broken window 
the alarm system at the museum was not functioning and police 
were called by a neighbor who heard the sound of breaking glass 
the radio said 
it did not say whether the alarm was disabled during the theft 
or was out of order before the breakin 
a police spokesman reached by phone would only confirm that the 
paintings were missing 
the paintings date from about 1884 known as the artists 
brabant period when he worked among the farmers and rural artisans 
of the brabant which encompasses a large part of the southern 
netherlands 
paintings from van goghs brabant period are generally dark in 
tone and employ none of the bright colors of his later french 
period which have brought record auction prices 
they really are flemish school pictures before he really 
discovered impressionism said jennings the christies expert 
the sitting farmers wife and the wheels of the water mill 
in gennep were on loan from the national fine arts service said 
service spokeswoman marry de zwaan the digging farmers wife 
was owned by the museum 
the vast treasure trove of art owned by the dutch nation is not 
insured 
there was speculation in the dutch art world that the paintings 
were stolen for ransom rather than resale since underground sales 
of stolen art usually realize only 1015 percent of a paintings 
open market value jennings said 
the most significant of the dutch impressionists works are held 
by amsterdams van gogh museum and the kroellermueller museum near 
the eastern dutch town of otterlo 
in december 1988 three van goghs including one version of his 
famous depiction of rural poverty the potato eaters were 
stolen from the kroellermueller 
in may of that year three other works by modern masters 
including van goghs carnations were taken from amsterdams 
municipal museum 
all the stolen works were subsequently recovered 
wednesdays theft came during the final weeks of a major 
exhibition of hundreds of van goghs paintings and drawings at the 
van gogh museum and the kroellermueller 
no thefts or vandalism have been reported at the show which 
marks the centenary of the artists death

the chairman of a house panel that oversees 
foreign aid is warning israel that he will support cutting its aid 
next year if that government expands settlements in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
if israel expands their settlements in any way or if they add 
a single new settlement i will make a flat commitment to support 
any request made by the administration to reduce aid to israel in 
next years bill said rep david obey dwis 
the comments set obey chairman of the house appropriations 
foreign operations subcommittee on a collision course with the 
newly installed rightwing israeli government which has promised 
to expand settlements in the territories seized in the 1967 sixday 
war 
in jerusalem a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
today he regretted such warnings 
yossi benaharon directorgeneral of shamirs office would not 
say whether israel planned such expansions 
i dont want to answer any questions on settlements because it 
would only inflate their importance we hope that the issue will be 
removed from the agenda of usisraeli relations he told the 
associated press 
obey issued the warning as the house approved a 157 billion 
aid bill for the year beginning oct 1 which includes israels 
customary 3 billion in military and economic aid making it the 
largest single recipient of us largess 
the overall bill represented what obey termed the start of a 
gradual turn away from americas emphasis on military aid to its 
friends and allies around the globe and toward economic 
development and trade it cut nearly 400 million president bush 
had sought in military assistance and put the money into aid to 
africa refugees children and eastern europe 
as it worked through a pile of proposed amendments to the bill 
the house also voted narrowly to preserve president bushs policy 
of not sending us aid to international family planning groups 
linked to abortion and to keep nonlethal aid flowing to 
cambodias noncommunist resistance 
obey said he meant his comments on israeli settlement as a 
very friendly warning intended to head off developments that 
could further jeopardize peace in the unstable region he said the 
amount of any aid cut would be based on how much is spent on 
expanding present settlements or creating new ones 
israel is a sovereign nation and has the right to do anything 
they want but the us government has no obligation to fund 
either directly or indirectly settlements which we believe to be 
an impediment to the peace process he said 
on the population issue the house voted 224 to 198 to send 3 
million through private groups for family planning and other health 
projects in romania whose people have for decades been subject to 
a government policy against contraception 
but the amendment offered by rep christopher smith rnj 
excluded two groups from participation the united nations 
population fund and the international planned parenthood federation 
which participate in abortion counseling referral or services 
smiths opponents argued that those two groups are the only ones 
that now operate in romania so barring them would make any aid 
program for that country ineffective but smith and allies 
countered that bush would veto any bill that included funding for 
the two abortionlinked agencies 
the lawmakers also adopted 260 to 162 an amendment by rep 
stephen solarz dny to provide 7 million in nonlethal aid to 
the coalition opposing cambodias vietnameseinstalled government 
that replaced language in the bill barring any aid to the 
resistance a prohibition supported by members who feared the 
dominance of the khmer rouge in the coalition 
the khmer rouge ruled cambodia in the 1970s and were responsible 
for the deaths of more than 1 million people in what became known 
as the killing fields they are the strongest military faction 
in a coalition which also receives millions of dollars in covert 
us military aid 
the bill the principal vehicle for us military economic and 
development aid to friends and allies still faces serious 
objections from the white house because of a provision cutting 
military aid to el salvador 
the measure would withhold half of next years 85 million in 
aid and apply conditions intended to keep the warring government 
and leftist fmln rebels at the peace table negotiations on a new 
bipartisan policy toward el salvador are being conducted separately 
between secretary of state james a baker iii and a team of house 
democrats and republicans

communist party radicals said today they had 
virtually given up hope for major reforms of their party and 
predicted a schism at the upcoming congress despite president 
mikhail s gorbachevs appeals for unity 
leaders of the democratic platform a group struggling to 
drastically change the communist party from within told a news 
conference that they were unimpressed by party efforts at internal 
reform 
in reality despite the many statements of leaders the 
communist party has shown it is simply incapable of reforming 
itself said vladimir lysenko one of the groups leaders 
the proposed split in the communist party would be the first 
since 1922 and gorbachev the partys general secretary has 
warned that it would divide and weaken the forces struggling for 
reform 
hardliners appeared to be consolidating their strength before 
the 28th congress of the communist party due to open in the 
kremlin on monday 
the reformist democratic platform has the backing of only about 
100 of 4700 delegates at the congress but is believed to have 
much wider support in the party rankandfile 
lysenko said the group would fight for its views at the 
congress but if it proves impossible there will be a statement 
that either the communist party has split or a new party is 
starting 
another democratic platform leader stepan sulakshin said he 
expected more than 2 million of the communist partys 19 million 
members to quit 
gorbachev speaking last week to a congress of communists from 
the russian republic said a split in the party would be a gift 
to opponents of his reforms 
lysenko predicted a very hard time for gorbachev from 
hardliners but the platform leaders said they opposed a proposal 
to put off the congress until autumn to stem the conservative tide 
a plenum of the partys central committee is expected to address 
the timing of the congress and other issues on friday but with 
both right and left coming out against it a postponement appeared 
unlikely 
lysenko criticized a proposed new set of party rules published 
today in the community party daily pravda as well as a proposed 
program published wednesday 
the new documents make a pretense at reform he said but 
remained wholly in the old spirit retaining tight discipline 
over the party forbidding factions and refusing to remove party 
cells from workplaces 
the democratic platform wants the party to allow factions 
relinquish its massive assets remove itself from direct management 
of the country and become a westernstyle parliamentary party 
party ideology chief vadim medvedev said the leadership tried to 
accommodate the democratic platform as it drafted its new rules and 
program but also tried to build a consensus with the party 
mainstream and the traditionalist marxist platform 
the rules make several key changes in the workings of the 
communist party political machine 
the party leader would be called the chairman instead of the 
general secretary and be elected directly by the 4700member 
congress instead of the 249member central committee 
the collective leadership would be called the presidium instead 
of the politburo it is expected to be enlarged from its current 
dozen members to include the heads of the 15 republic parties 
although this is not specified in the published proposal 
the central committee could be replenished in between 
congresses that would make its membership much more fluid 
party leaders could not be elected to more than two terms in a 
row 
republic parties would become more independent

a car bomb exploded near a syrian army 
checkpoint in moslem west beirut early today and another wrecked 
the office of a proiraqi group in south lebanon police reported 
the explosions killed a 7yearold girl and wounded 10 people 
the girl was slain when a bomb exploded near the baath arab 
socialist party office in sidon the southern provincial capital 
officials said 
four other people were wounded in the blast that devastated the 
office on the first floor of a sixstory apartment building in the 
port citys main thoroughfare 
iraq and syria ruled by rival wings of the baath party have 
been feuding for 11 years 
in the beirut bombing police said six civilians were wounded 
among them an unidentified sri lankan woman 
the datsun that exploded in the talet elkhayyat district 400 
yards from the syrian checkpoint contained about 65 pounds of tnt 
according to an explosives expert five cars were set on fire by 
the blast 
it damaged apartment buildings and several shops leaving the 
street littered with broken glass and twisted metal residents said 
the car had been parked on the street for several days 
as is usual with bombings in lebanon there were no claims of 
responsibility 
a chain of bombings since the syrian army moved into west beirut 
in 1987 to quell militia anarchy has been seen as a campaign 
designed to undermine the syrian peacekeeping effort 
also in south lebanon sunni moslem militiamen of the nasserite 
popular organization battled with fighters of the israelibacked 
south lebanon army east of sidon the provincial capital 
police reported one south lebanon army militiaman was killed and 
two nasserites were wounded in the clashes with mortars 
rocketpropelled grenades and machine guns around kfar falous a 
hilltop village east of sidon on the front line between the two 
forces

a top aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said today he regretted warnings that us aid would be cut if 
israel expanded jewish settlements in occupied lands 
yossi benaharon directorgeneral of shamirs office refused 
to say whether israel planned such expansions 
i dont want to answer any questions on settlements because it 
would only inflate their importance we hope that the issue will be 
removed from the agenda of usisraeli relations he told the 
associated press 
but shamir spokesman avi pazner said that its obvious that 
nobody has sought to put limits on existing settlements 
pazner dismissed as pure speculation reports that shamir and 
his ultrarightist coalition partners had agreed to build 5000 new 
housing units a year in the settlements five thousand new units 
would house 25000 people 
the recent report by the haaretz daily also said that by 
september 1050 new housing units will be completed in the 
settlements bringing 6800 more settlers into the occupied lands 
israel captured the territories in the 1967 war with its arab 
neighbors 
according to a recent survey by the newspaper 84000 jewish 
settlers live in the west bank and 4000 in the gaza strip 
previous figures put the number of west bank settlers at about 
75000 and those in gaza at 2500 
us rep david obey chairman of the house foreign aid 
subcommittee said in washington on wednesday he would support cuts 
in us aid to israel if its government persisted in expanding 
settlements in the occupied territories 
the us government has no obligation to fund either directly 
or indirectly settlements which we believe to be an impediment to 
the peace process said obey dwis 
president bush has spoken out sharply against jewish settlements 
in the occupied lands and the issue has been a main factor in the 
deteriorating relations between the two allies 
referring to obeys warning benaharon said we regret this 
attitude 
benaharon said israels top priority was the absorption of 
soviet jewish immigrants we are not taken up now with the 
subject of settlements because the big agenda item is 
immigration he said

prime minister yitzhak shamir today proposed to 
president bush that israel have a say in approving palestinian 
delegates for proposed middle east peace talks israel and army 
radio reported 
the reports said the proposal in a letter to bush opposed the 
inclusion of deportees or palestinians from arab east jerusalem as 
suggested by secretary of state james a baker iii 
israel has objected to what it views as attempts to give the plo 
an indirect role in the talks under the us plan the palestinian 
delegation would hold preliminary peace talks with israelis in 
cairo egypt 
shamirs office confirmed the prime minister sent the letter to 
bush today in response to a letter from bush two weeks ago the 
bush letter urged israels new rightwing government to advance the 
peace process and requested answers to bakers proposals shamirs 
office said 
it would not comment on the reported proposal to choose 
palestinian delegates from a pool of names that would require 
approval from israel 
we are ready to continue to cooperate with secretary baker to 
advance a dialogue with a palestinian delegation that will be 
composed on a namebyname basis the israel radio report quoted 
shamirs letter as saying 
but as you know mr president we disagree with the 
participation of deportees and arabs from jerusalem in the 
delegation 
shamir has opposed participation of exiles or east jerusalem 
residents as demanded by palestinians he fears that would be seen 
as conceding issues of principle on palestinian demands to make 
jerusalem the capital of a palestinian state and to give the right 
of return to millions of arabs living abroad 
israel has also objected to giving the palestine liberation 
organization an indirect role in the negotiations claiming the plo 
is a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of israel 
in his letter to bush shamir shifted the emphasis from the 
stalled attempt to start a dialogue with the palestinians to the 
broader question of reaching peace with israels arab neighbors 
the radio reports said 
shamir reportedly told bush the refusal of arab states to end 
the state of war with israel was at the heart of the conflict in 
the region the report said he emphasized most efforts should be 
aimed at reaching peace between israel and its arab neighbors

a day after it upheld arizonas death penalty 
law the supreme court today let stand a ruling that had the effect 
of overturning most existing death sentences in arizona idaho and 
montana 
by a 43 vote the justices refused to reinstate the death 
sentence of john harvey adamson convicted of murdering newspaper 
reporter don bolles in 1976 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals previously had struck down 
adamsons death sentence but the justices wednesday upheld 
arizonas death penalty law in a decision directly conflicting with 
the 9th circuit courts ruling in adamsons case 
in throwing out adamsons sentence the appeals court struck 
down a key provision of arizonas death penalty law one which was 
declared valid by the supreme court on wednesday 
idaho and montana have the same provisions in their death 
penalty laws 
the confusing turn of events apparently was sparked by the fact 
that justices sandra day oconnor a former state judge in arizona 
and anthony m kennedy a former 9th circuit court judge took no 
part in acting on arizonas appeal in adamsons case 
that left only chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white and antonin scalia voting to set aside the 9th 
circuit courts ruling 
justices willam j brennan thurgood marshall harry a blackmun 
and john paul stevens who voted wednesday to strike down arizonas 
death penalty law apparently voted to deny arizonas appeal in the 
adamson case 
the net result a supreme court decision upholding arizonas 
death penalty law and a 9th circuit court decision striking it down 
both remain on the books 
the practical effect it appears adamson cannot be sentenced to 
death 
todays high court action was sparked by an appeal filed by 
arizona attorney general bob corbin 
bolles who had been investigating organized crime for the 
arizona republic in phoenix died june 11 1976 nine days after 
his car exploded 
prosecutors said adamson was paid 10000 to attach a bomb to 
the reporters car before dying bolles identified adamson as the 
man who had made an appointment to see him the day of the bombing 
adamson originally was allowed to plead guilty to seconddegree 
murder in exchange for his testimony against two others allegedly 
involved in the murder plot 
his testimony helped convict max dunlap a building contractor 
and james robison a plumber 
but the arizona supreme court threw out the dunlap and robison 
convictions in 1980 and ordered a new trial for them the two have 
not been retried 
adamson who by 1980 was serving a 20year prison term said he 
would not testify at a new trial unless the state met additional 
conditions including his release and the governments help in 
establishing a new identity 
after adamsons refusal to cooperate state prosecutors filed 
firstdegree murder charges against him he was tried convicted 
and sentenced to death 
the 9th circuit court threw out adamsons death sentence in 
1986 ruling that he had been subjected to double jeopardy the 
supreme court reversed that ruling and reinstated the death 
sentence by a 54 vote in 1987 
the 9th circuit then considered other issues raised by adamsons 
case and once again threw out his death sentence 
the case is lewis vs adamson 881553

a st paul minn prosecutor who says he was 
defamed by a minneapolis television stations reporting about a 
mysterious 1982 death lost a supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment refused to revive ramsey county 
attorney tom foleys libel lawsuit against wccotv 
a state trial judge threw out foleys suit before it reached a 
jury and the minnesota supreme court upheld that dismissal last 
dec 26 
kathleen greenings body was found under water in the bathtub of 
her lauderdale home july 21 1982 the county medical examiner 
initially listed the manner of death as undetermined but in 
the fall of 1985 was considering changing that designation to 
homicide 
wccotv in early 1986 investigated the death and its handling by 
the criminal justice system its reports were critical of all 
public officials and agencies involved in the investigation 
including foley and his office 
foley contended that the wcco reports libeled him in at least 
197 statements which a state trial judge divided into factual 
scenarios 
that foley requested the attorney generals office to remove a 
state investigator from the case 
that foley blocked the issuance of a search warrant for the 
financial records of mrs greenings husband one of his campaign

chinese who desecrate the national flag can be 
imprisoned for up to three years under a law passed by legislators 
today 
the nations first flag law adopted by the standing committee 
of the national peoples congress also forbids the use of the 
standard in advertisements or as a trademark the official xinhua 
news agency said 
xinhua said wilful damage to a flag is punishable by up to three 
years of imprisonment detention surveillance or deprivation of 
political rights 
before the law was passed china often harshly punished those 
who defaced any of its national symbols last year a chinese court 
gave a life sentence to a man who during the prodemocracy 
demonstrations threw paint on the large portrait of mao hanging 
from tiananmen gate 
in the united states this week the house of representatives 
rejected a proposed amendment to the constitution permitting the 
enactment of laws making it illegal to desecrate the flag 
the chinese law says every citizen and organization must respect 
and take good care of the national flag which shows four small and 
one large yellow star against a red field 
the large star stands for the communist party and the small 
stars represent various classes in chinese society the red color 
represents the communist revolution 
the law says chinas flag since the communist takeover in 1949 
must be raised every day on tiananmen square at the gate to the 
communist headquarters of zhongnanhai in front of various 
government and party offices and at ports airports and border 
railway stations 
all fulltime schools must fly the flag whenever school is in 
session work units and neighborhood committees must raise the flag 
on national holidays and other major occasions 
flags should be flown at halfmast when chinese leaders or 
foreigners who have contributed to world peace die or when 
disasters cause heavy casualties 
the law to go into effect on october 1 chinas national day 
also states that flags may be produced only by officially 
designated enterprises

the head of the us environmental protection 
agency said today that a recent un report by a prestigious group 
of scientists on global warming was insufficient to persuade the 
united states to take action 
epa administrator william reilly told reporters that the problem 
is not understood with the degree of certainty that would 
warrant taking action to curb emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other socalled greenhouse gases 
taking such action which could affect everything from cars to 
power plants would result in very substantial economic 
dislocation reilly said at the international conference on the 
ozone layer 
the report released earlier this month by the united 
nationsbacked intergovernmental panel on climate change pooled 
the expertise of some of the worlds leading scientists 
it concluded that the earths temperature has already begun to 
warm and appealed for urgent action to curb emissions of 
greenhouse gases to prevent potential climatological disaster 
but sweeping changes to the us and world economy would be 
needed to reduce the burning of fossil fuels that produce carbon 
dioxide 
the united states the leading carbon dioxide producer wants 
more study into whether global warming is taking place and if so 
what is causing it the administration has increased the budget for 
research into climate change by 57 percent this year reilly said 
reillys comments were the strongest statement so far by an 
administration official on the report they seemed to indicate a 
rejection of its unequivocal conclusions 
we do not believe at this time that the evidence is 
sufficiently compelling to move us toward the dislocation and 
highly expensive interventions that would be required to cut 
emissions reilly said 
david d doniger of the natural resources defense council in 
washington accused the united states of refusing to accept the 
work of a group it had previously supported 
the us had been saying it was waiting for the report said 
doniger who is attending the ozone conference as an observer 
one thing is clear it is getting harder and harder for our 
country to hide behind the veil of insufficient knowledge 
the report is bound to figure in discussions next month in 
houston at the summit of the seven leading industrialized 
democracies last years summit declaration dwelt extensively on 
environmental issues and the upcoming meeting is being viewed as 
the next major step in international global warming policy 
the final report of the un panel is scheduled for release in 
august before the world climate change conference in november in 
geneva

the lawyer for convicted nazi war criminal john 
demjanjuk made a final plea to israels supreme court today to 
spare his life arguing there is enough doubt to take the gallows 
out of this case 
yoram sheftel demjanjuks lawyer ended his appeal by asking a 
panel of five justices to overturn the death sentence because of 
lingering doubt about demjanjuks guilt 
there is no case that potentially could contain a mistake more 
than this case he argued 
sheftel has argued that demjanjuk is innocent a victim of 
mistaken identity and not ivan the terrible a gaschamber 
operator at the treblinka death camp in world war ii 
the appeal began may 14 and was the longest in israels history 
with 13 days of defense arguments and 12 days for the prosecution 
sheftel also asked the supreme court not to hand down a decision 
before jan 1 in order to give the defense time to investigate 
possible new evidence 
chief justice meir shamgar said the justices would consider the 
request but did not indicate when they would rule 
demjanjuk a 70yearold retired cleveland autoworker was 
convicted and sentenced to death in april 1988 for crimes against 
humanity and crimes against the jewish people his trial lasted 14 
months 
three trial judges agreed with the prosecution that demjanjuk 
was ivan the terrible the treblinka guard who raped beat and 
slashed jews as they were forced into the gas chambers 
more than 850000 jews were murdered at treblinka in 
nazioccupied poland in 194243 
a ukrainian native demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken 
identity and says he spent those years in several german pow camps 
as a captured soviet soldier

jennifer and rick cook drove up the long 
narrow driveway to see what was left of jennifers parents home 
oh god oh god she wailed as their car snaked back into the 
hills passing through thick smoke ash and embers 
but there was the house she grew up in untouched by the 
firestorm that had swept through several hours earlier 
its ok its ok she said tears streaming down her cheeks 
a few minutes later she was reunited with her parents susan and 
george grgich who credited their homes survival to a new asphalt 
roof 
the grgiches were among the fortunate those who escaped the 
3500acre inferno wednesday night in the suburban foothills of 
this quiet wealthy coastal city 
at least 280 families lost their homes in the blaze which 
leveled entire neighborhoods firefighters often could do little 
more than soak the remains of what were once 750000 homes in 
some instances they were able to save homes adjacent to the worst 
damage 
utility workers moved from house to house in the early morning 
darkness shutting off gas valves otherwise neighborhoods were 
deserted with the only sound the eerie whistle of a flaming gas 
main or the tumble of pots and pans in what was once the cupboard 
of a designer kitchen 
one vantage point revealed a residential landscape dotted by 
flames for miles in every direction under an orange sky filled 
with soot one resident narrated his escape 
i started reading the paper after i came home from work and 
then my 12yearold said daddy the back yard is on fire said 
bryan gaggs whose home was untouched while those of two of his 
nearest neighbors were gutted 
when i finally left the house i thought my house was already 
going but it turned out to be unscathed gaggs said 
about a halfmile away across a small canyon seven homes were 
destroyed 
jerry neeley wearing a dentists mask to breathe through the 
smoke stayed behind to try to save his sprawling residence 
it was like an inferno he said i saw smoke a couple 
miles away and had just put hamburgers on i hurried dinner so we 
could all go upstairs and watch the fire and then it was on us it 
must have traveled several miles in less than 30 minutes 
neeley threw flammable items including lawn furniture into his 
pool 
at a red cross rescue center in the gymnasium at the university 
of california santa barbara evacuees gathered around a radio as a 
roving reporter rattled off the street addresses of homes that had 
been burned to the ground 
one woman who identified herself only as sue heard her street 
address called i didnt get one picture she said sobbing 
gently i didnt get a photograph not one thing not one 
memory 
her husband who has parkinsons disease was rescued 
weve got each other sue said well start again

the government today acknowledged that 
it killed civilians during bombing and strafing raids on tamil 
rebels and it blamed pilot error for the deaths 
the deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne gave no figures 
for the number of civilians killed in savage fighting in sri 
lankas north and east 
at least 1679 combatants have been killed in the 17dayold 
upsurge in the countrys civil war the latest deaths included 35 
rebels killed in fighting wednesday and today military officials 
said speaking on condition of anonymity four government soldiers 
also were killed they said 
most of the air raids have focused on jaffna a 
denselypopulated city of 120000 in the north 
some bombs have hit targets which we did not envisage and we 
regret that wijeratne told a weekly news briefing wijeratne 
denied a rebel claim that the government had used napalm a 
powerful defoliant in its air attacks 
helicopter gunships and bombers have bombed and strafed the town 
in an attempt to break a rebel siege on jaffna fort one of two 
government military installations in the rebelcontrolled north at 
least 225 soldiers and policemen are trapped inside the fort 
last week government helicopters dropped leaflets on the city 
warning nearby residents to evacuate their homes 
to capture the 200yearold fort tamil rebels have attempted to 
tunnel under the installation and to scale its walls with 
explosives tied to their bodies each attempt has failed the 
military said 
in the briefing gen cyril ranatunge also defended military 
policy saying that helicopter gunships did not attack unidentified 
targets 
we are not going to kill our own people he said 
his answer was in response to a reporter who claimed he watched 
two helicopter gunships shoot up a village for 15 minutes in 
eastern sri lanka where there were no apparent rebel fortifications 
or targets 
a helicopter gunship also strafed a vehicle carrying foreign 
correspondents including a los angeles times reporter on monday 
the correspondents were not injured 
military officials said the government had launched a mass 
recruitment campaign to prepare for what many think will be a long 
war with the guerrillas so far 12000 men mostly sinhalese have 
volunteered to fight military officials said 
tamil rebels have waged a war for a separate homeland in the 
north and the east since 1983 the fighting has claimed more than 
11000 lives 
the latest round of fighting ended a 13monthold ceasefire 
negotiated between the government and the rebels in may 1989 the 
flareup began june 11 after a tamil man claimed he was manhandled 
by sinhalese police tamil tiger guerrillas responded by attacking 
police stations in the east 
members of the mainly hindu tamil minority claim they are 
discriminated against by the majority sinhalese who dominate the 
government and military and are predominantly buddhist 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the islands 16 million people 
and control the army and the government tamils comprise 18 percent

government said it was possible to consider these and other 
issues if the rebels stop fighting and halt support for 
independence of the countrys northernmost province 
tigrean rebels said sunday they were ready to implement an 
immediate ceasefire if president mengistu haile mariams 
government stepped down and was replaced by a broadbased interim 
government that would hold internationally supervised elections 
the council of state said it would consider the proposals if the 
tigreans halt their support of a separate insurgency seeking 
independence for the northernmost province eritrea and refrain

got to take advantage of anything that comes along

city officials shunned nelson mandela 
on his arrival overnight in miami where the south african 
activists embrace of cubas fidel castro has driven a wedge 
between blacks and cubanamericans 
about 300 demonstrators today joined an estimated 2000 people 
outside a convention center where mandela was to speak the 
demonstrators mostly cubanamericans waved placards protesting 
mandelas praise of castro 
mandela is a traitor said ricardo acabader who wrapped 
himself in the cuban flag im here to fight for human rights 
police kept the two groups apart although they shouted back and 
forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up 
mandela who earlier wednesday laid a wreath at the grave of 
martin luther king jr in atlanta arrived at miamis airport just 
before midnight to none of the fanfare with which he was met in the 
four other us cities he has visited 
we do feel somewhat embarrassed gerald mcentee president 
of the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees said after welcoming mandela embarrassed for the 
state of florida and embarrassed for dade county 
a crowd of about 200 people who greeted mandela outside his 
hotel early today chanted free south africa and then free 
south florida and finally where is suarez a reference to 
miami mayor xavier suarez who denounced mandela for his support of 
castro 
were here to show him our love and appreciation said doris 
dorcilini were unhappy that our local politicians are not doing 
the same were going to remember this when they need us 
mandela 71 was scheduled to speak today to the afscme 
convention but his speech was delayed by 2 hours the 125 
millionmember union has been a strong supporter of mandelas 
african national congress he was to head to detroit later in the 
day 
inside the convention hall only a small group of miamiarea 
officials waited for mandela including dade county commissioner 
charles dusseau 
in miami opinions tend to be very heartfelt he said 
thats why you get this kind of reaction theres been a lot of 
suffering on both sides and its difficult for each side to 
understand the other 
after mandela last week reaffirmed his support for castro the 
miami city commission with three cubanamerican members dropped 
plans for a welcome proclamation five cubanamerican mayors issued 
a statement condemning his support for castro 
mayor alex daoud of this largely jewish city criticized mandela 
for supprting not only castro but the palestine liberation 
organization and libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
leaders of miamis black community wracked by racial violence 
four times in the past decade pledged to avenge the slight to 
mandela 
he is our brother said johnnie mcmillian president of 
miamis naacp chapter if they say hes not welcome theyre 
saying were not welcome too 
in an oftenmoving visit to atlanta on wednesday mandela paid 
silent tribute to the slain leader of the us civil rights 
movement then borrowed from kings i have a dream speech at a 
soldout rally at 46000seat grant field 
his dreams are certainly going to see the light of day in our 
country mandela said let freedom ring in south africa we 
will continue to struggle until we have transformed south africa 
into a united nonracial nonsexist democratic country 
although king espoused nonviolence several prominent civil 
rights leaders defended mandelas refusal to renounce force in the 
struggle for racial equality in south africa 
we who are thoroughly committed to the advocacy of 
nonviolence nonetheless respect the right of oppressed people 
everywhere to seek their own liberation the rev joseph lowery 
president of the southern christian leadership conference that king 
founded said during a gathering at big bethel ame church 
rev lowery has spoken for all of us and he spoke well 
kings widow coretta scott king said to mandela we support 
you we love you we revere you 
mandela said black south africans face a different battle than 
the one king led 
unlike you we are still under the grip of white supremacy 
mandela said to reporters he added nonviolence is a good 
policy when conditions permit

a texas television news reporter who wednesday began a sixmonth 
jail term for refusing to surrender the name of a confidential 
source in a police killing 
justice byron r white acting without any comment denied an 
emergency request by brian karem a reporter for kmoltv in san 
antonio the request had sought to postpone karems sentence while 
he appeals the contemptofcourt finding against him 
karem speaking from the bexar county jail steps wednesday 
said i sure dont want to do six months in jail but im going to 
keep my promise 
karem defied three court orders to turn over confidential notes 
of a telephone interview with one of two jailed murder suspects 
last year lawyers for the two suspects in the case say they have 
to know who arranged the interviews to assure a fair trial 
karem has said the source fears for his life if his identity is 
revealed 
the jailing stems from an interview karem conducted last year 
with capital murder defendant henry hernandez accused with his 
brother julian in the march 1989 shooting death of policeman gary 
williams 
during the interview henry hernandez said he shot the officer 
in selfdefense

the head of the justice departments criminal 
division today announced his resignation to enter private law 
practice creating another vacancy in the agencys top ranks 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis jr a career 
federal prosecutor who has headed the criminal division since 1988 
said in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh that he plans 
to leave the justice department on aug 31 
dennis said in a statement that he will become a senior partner 
at the prestigious philadelphia law firm of morgan lewis amp bockius 
denniss departure adds another vacancy to the top echelons of 
the justice department which has been plagued by a series of 
personnel difficulties under thornburgh 
but officials stressed that denniss resignation is unrelated to 
the recent staff turmoil which came to a head in may when deputy 
attorney general donald b ayer resigned 
nevertheless two sources said dennis had grown frustrated with 
thornburghs management style which had centralized decision 
making in the attorney generals office 
in a statement dennis said thornburgh has provided 
outstanding leadership to the department and i am delighted to 
have had the opportunity to work under him 
in a letter to president bush dennis said his decision to leave 
is based upon family considerations and my feeling that i will 
not be a complete lawyer until i succeed in the private practice of 
law 
following the resignation of ayer who sources say was frozen 
out of decision making thornburgh reassigned two longtime aides 
who had served him when he was pennsylvania governor 
the reassignment of chief spokesman david runkel and chief of 
staff robert s ross jr was an attempt to counter criticism that 
thornburgh was surrounded by a palace guard of loyalists 
officials conceded 
william p barr the acting deputy attorney general who has been 
nominated to take that job permanently told the senate judiciary 
committee wednesday that he is restoring the traditional role of 
the agencys no 2 position 
barr appearing at his confirmation hearing said thornburghs 
staff took on more responsibility than the attorney general 
intended because of the difficulty recruiting new people at the end 
of the reagan administration 
thornburgh who took office in august 1988 was asked to stay on 
as bushs attorney general 
the personnel difficulties continued however 
thornburghs first choice to be deputy robert fiske was 
scuttled by conservatives who objected to the new york lawyerss 
involvement in judicial screening by the american bar association 
dennis who is the first black to head the justice departments 
criminal division also served as acting deputy attorney general 
last year a former us attorney in philadelphia dennis will join 
the national litigation group of morgan lewis amp bockius 
officials noted that as a reagan administration holdover dennis 
long had plans to leave the department particularly because he 
commutes daily from his home near philadelphia 
several other nominations for vacant positions are pending in 
the senate lee rawls was recently nominated to head the office of 
legislative affairs to replace carol crawford who resigned last 
winter following a series of bureaucratic turf wars

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reviving a lawsuit against an indiana prosecutor who advised police 
to hypnotize a woman suspected of shooting her children 
the court said it will review a ruling that the prosecutor is 
immune from being sued for such conduct 
the case stems from a shooting at the home of cathy burns in 
muncie ind on sept 2 1982 
ms burns who worked as a police dispatcher in muncie said an 
intruder shot and wounded her two sons eddie griffin and denny 
sells while they slept and knocked her unconscious 
a message scrawled on the bathroom mirror in lipstick said i 
took what you loved most 
police suspected ms burns shot her sons and planned to ask her 
to submit to hypnosis after she passed lie detector and voice 
stress tests 
chief deputy prosecutor richard reed of delaware county ind 
advised the police to go ahead with the hypnosis the police 
officers said they doubted the technique was lawful because they 
had been told during their police academy training that hypnotizing 
suspects was unacceptable 
under hypnosis ms burns identified the assailant as katie 
and also referred to herself at one point as katie 
the police officers concluded that she had a split personality 
and regarded her statement under hypnosis as a confession 
the police then obtained a search warrant after misleading a 
judge by not disclosing that her statement was made while 
hypnotized 
the judge later ruled the statement inadmissible and reed 
dropped the prosecution but ms burns said reed continued making 
statements to the news media saying he was convinced of her guilt 
ms burns then sued the deputy prosecutor accusing him of 
violating her civil rights 
a federal judge threw out the suit the ruling was upheld in 
feburary by the 7th us circuit court of appeals 
a prosecutor is absolutely immune from suit when acting as a 
legal advisor to police officers the appeals court said 
the case would be different if reed had participated in 
administering the hypnosis the appeals court said but it said it 
did not regard what reed did as participating in the investigation 
the case is burns vs reed 891715

against the pair 
assistant us attorney charles labella delivered a final 
stinging rebuttal to the defense on thursday 
he stacked packs of philippine pesos on the rail of the jury box 
to dramatize his claim that mrs marcos knew her husband the late 
president ferdinand marcos was enriching himself by stealing 
millions from his countrys treasury 
and he charged that khashoggi knew a us federal court 
injunction had frozen the marcoses us assets before he agreed in 
1986 to backdate documents to show that he not they owned four 
new york buildings and some paintings 
when you look at all the evidence you will be convinced beyond 
a reasonable doubt that imelda marcos is guilty and that adnan 
khashoggi also is guilty labella told the jurors 
today us district judge john f keenan instructed the jurors 
on the law in the case the jurors who will be sequestered at the 
close of his charge were to begin deliberations in the afternoon 
keenan said the jurors can convict only if they find the 
defendants guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt after a part of 
a broader package including spending cuts to 
reduce the deficit 
on thursday the treasury received nearly 539 in bids for 
every 1 of four year notes that it wanted to sell as part of a 
831 fouryear note auction that was the strongest demand on 
record for an issue of that maturity market analysts said 
the market has handled the supply this week pretty well 
said james winder money market economist for merrill lynch capital 
markets 
in addition to the fouryear note auction the government sold 
172 billion in threemonth and sixmonth bills on monday and 
1125 billion in twoyear notes on tuesday 
winder said there may also be some lingering positive feeling 
from the presidents change of heart on taxes 
there were no new economic reports out today but winder said 
the general perception is our economy is weak economic 
weakness increases chances that the federal reserve will encourage 
lower interest rates a developmnet that would boost bond prices 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments were up 116 point intermediate maturities advanced by 
between 532 point and point and longterm issues were up as much 
as 932 point according to telerate inc the financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer edged up 154 to 115911 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 799 percent as the 
discount slipped 3 basis points to 774 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 805 percent as the discount lost 2 basis 
points to 764 percent yields on oneyear bills dropped to 807 
percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 754 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 8 516 percent unchanged

lithuanias prime minister today urged 
parliament to freeze the republics declaration of independence 
saying soviet president mikhail s gorbachev would then lift an 
economic blockade and begin talks 
kazimera prunskiene opening a critical debate on the proposed 
moratorium said lithuania could leave in place all subsequent 
decisions those include replacement of the soviet constitution by 
a lithuanian document and a resolution suggesting that lithuanian 
youth can ignore the soviet draft 
the debate in the lithuanian supreme council parliament began 
after gorbachev held a series of discussions with mrs prunskiene 
and lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis to try to solve their 
dispute over lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence 
the streets of the lithuanian capital were calm and there was 
little visible evidence of the economic blockade in which the 
soviet union has cut off most natural gas all oil and a variety 
of other raw materials and manufactured goods the blockade 
imposed in april has put nearly 50000 of the republics 11 
million workers out of work 
the moratorium is only on the declaration of independence not 
on all the other acts mrs prunskiene said its a political 
statement 
the status of lithuania doesnt change and the supreme council 
remains the same she said pressing the recalcitrant parliament 
to accept a compromise 
soviet officials have not commented on the talks tuesday and 
wednesday between gorbachev and lithuanian officials the only 
official statement released late tuesday said talks with the 
republic of 38 million people could begin only if it declares a 
moratorium it said the talks can only be held in the framework of 
a nationwide discussion of a new treaty of union among republics 
lithuanias compromise proposal calls for a threemonth 
moratorium on independence but the moratorium would not take 
effect until the soviet union opened formal negotiations with 
leaders of the baltic republic government spokesman ceslovas 
jursenas said 
landsbergis who has been less enthusiastic about a compromise 
than mrs prunskiene did not clearly endorse one in his statement 
to the parliament but he did tell deputies that its most 
important to get the negotiations started 
he said the lithuanian leadership wanted to choose the best 
conditions for entering critical talks over just how separation 
could be achieved 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania along with its 
baltic neighbors estonia and latvia in 1940 all three republics 
have been seeking to secede but lithuania has taken the lead 
one member of parliament eduardas vilkas said after listening 
to mrs prunskiene that he understood her to be requesting a 
political step not a juridical one to say that gorbachev is not 
the loser 
vilkas said he favored a compromise but that many lithuanian 
legislators opposed the deal this is very difficult 
psychologically for many deputies he said 
algis cekuolis an adviser to the parliament predicted that the 
discussion would be sharp some deputies insisted on a twothirds 
majority before agreeing to the compromise he said

fbi and sheriffs officials said the 
108 million holdup of an armored car may have been an inside job 
and they began questioning past and present employees of the 
courier service 
the robbery by at least two men with a shotgun tuesday was the 
biggest armored car heist in us history 
the fact that they had so much money its logical that 
they had some information said paul bellito an fbi spokesman in 
buffalo people have to be somewhat familiar with the routes of 
travel what their work habits are where they stop 
the armored car was seized at gunpoint after the driver and 
guard stopped at a convenience store for coffee and sandwiches 
while making a cash delivery to the federal reserve bank in 
buffalo officials said no one was injured 
the driver and guard told authorities they had been forced to 
drive to a wooded area where they were bound gagged and 
blindfolded the robbers put money bags weighing at least 1500 
pounds into another vehicle and fled 
the two employees of the armored motor service of america were 
given a liedetector test said sheriffs spokesman tom ryan he 
would not disclose the results 
capt neil flood said dozens of past and present employees were 
being interviewed you knock off an armored car youve got to 
know something about the business he said 
sheriff andrew p meloni said the unidentified driver and guard 
had not been ruled out as suspects 
fbi agent g robert langford said one of the holdup men was in a 
brown outfit similar to the uniforms worn by the armored car 
companys guards 
we dont know if that means he was an employee or if the 
uniform was used to gain access to the truck or to prevent him from 
attracting a lot of attention langford said 
investigators also were trying to determine how the holdup men 
penetrated the cars gunport with a shotgun the democrat and 
chronicle of rochester reported today the sliding metal hatch 
should have been locked the paper said 
meloni said the van used in the robbery was found wednesday as a 
result of a telephone tip it was abandoned in the driveway of a 
social club about five miles from where the holdup took place 
finding the van quickly is a real break for us meloni said 
today now the public may be able to tell us where the van has 
been 
the van originally dark blue had been recently painted dull 
gray the van was filled with covered money trays from the armored 
car 
meloni said some cash was found in envelopes in the van but he 
would not say how much it was very little comparatively 
speaking he said 
michael bucci amsa executive vice president told the syracuse 
poststandard that the convenience store stop violated company 
policy however amsa controller george clark said wednesday there 
is no rule prohibiting stops 
langford said company insiders are often involved in armored car 
robberies which are particularly difficult to pull off 
in a crime like this you often see the involvement of a 
current or former employee who might have access to information 
about routes times and the amount of money that is being 
transported he said but its just one possibility

iraqi president saddam hussein says his country 
is prepared for a war he views as inevitable unless israel 
stops what he calls its aggressive policies a report published 
today said 
the wall street journal quoted hussein as saying other countries 
are mistaken if they believe iraq is too tired from eight years of 
fighting with iran to indulge in a new war 
their assessment is totally wrong he said we shall 
respond to an israeli attack whenever it comes and wherever 
hussein called israel an evil entity and said the united 
states was indifferent to mideast concerns but he repeatedly said 
iraq would strike only if israel strikes first 
if war happens he promised it would not end quickly and the 
outcome will not be one israel desires 
iraq is in possession of binary chemical weapons our 
scientists and military men calculate this is sufficient enough to 
deter an israeli nuclear attack he said 
if the great powers use any opportunity they see available to 
suppress others and to reap benefits at others expense then the 
others will find themselves in a position that will force them to 
use any means available he warned

a supreme court justice today refused to help 
a texas television news reporter who has begun serving a sixmonth 
jail term for refusing to surrender the name of a source 
justice byron r white without comment denied an emergency 
request by brian karem of san antonios kmoltv the request sought 
to postpone karems sentence while he appeals the contemptofcourt 
finding against him 
i sure dont want to do six months in jail kmoltv reporter 
brian karem said on the bexar county jail steps as he surrendered 
to begin serving the jail term wednesday but im going to keep 
my promise 
the reporter has defied three court orders to turn over 
confidential notes of a telephone interview last year with one of 
the two suspects jailed in the murder case 
prosecution and defense lawyers who are preparing for the 
murder case contend they need to know who arranged the interview 
karem has said the source fears for his life if his identity is 
revealed 
we cant live up to our principles every day in life karem 
told reporters as he entered the jail but i think this is an 
important enough issue and i feel strongly enough about it that i 
want to live up to how i believe 
karem had hoped to stay out of jail while he appealed the 
contempt citations but those hopes ended tuesday when the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals refused to issue a stay 
sheriff harlon copeland met karem on the steps of the jail the 
reporter was accompanied by kmol news director ron harig station 
manager bob donohue and karems father james 
karem said his only hope for release would be for the source to 
come forward or for the us supreme court to block his sentence 
pending appeal 
it does not look very good for the first amendment today 
said his attorney laurence macon 
harig said the station would hold karems job open and continue 
to pay him while he is jailed 
the jailing stems from an interview karem conducted last year 
with capital murder defendant henry david hernandez accused with 
his brother julian in the march 1989 shooting death of police 
officer gary williams henry hernandez said during the interview 
that he shot the officer in selfdefense 
prosecution and defense attorneys say they have to know who 
arranged the interview so that they can determine whether it can be 
used in the trial under rules of evidence 
henry hernandez attorney does not want the interview admitted 
in the trial julian hernandez attorney does

nelson mandela touched a raw nerve among some 
americans with his effusive praise of the likes of libyas moammar 
gadhafi and cubas fidel castro and his refusal to renounce 
violence 
in miami where mandela arrived late wednesday city officials 
bowed to the wishes of angry cubanamericans and shunned the 
celebrated former prisoner the miami city commission dropped plans 
for a welcome proclamation last week after mandela lauded castro 
in effect mandelas critics are telling him to be more 
discriminating in his choice of friends but those same critics 
might ponder some of the allies the united states has had over the 
years 
panamas manuel noriega was considered a strategic ally until 
the united states turned its back on him three years ago before 
that there were a host of military presidents in latin america who 
enjoyed us confidence and generosity in africa few leaders have 
wielded a heavier hand than zaires mobutu sese seko a close us 
ally for years 
in 1972 president nixon embraced china at the time of the 
cultural revolution a period of extraordinary brutality in that 
country in the 1930s joseph stalin was responsible for the 
deaths of millions but that didnt stop president franklin 
roosevelt from joining forces with him against the nazis during 
world war ii 
basically mandelas defense is somewhat the same as that which 
the united states has used in defending its selection of allies 
the enemy of my enemy is my friend 
columnist charles krauthammer sympathizes with mandelas 
position one can hardly expect of a beleaguered people the 
highminded cleanhanded sifting of allies of a sweden 
krauthammer wrote 
the united states felt it could not afford to be choosy about 
its allies in the lifeordeath struggle against hitler mandela 
feels the same way about apartheid 
our attitude toward any country is determined by the attitude 
of that country toward apartheid mandela said last week he 
feels a kinship for yasser arafat because the palestine liberation 
organization like mandelas african national congress is 
fighting for the right of selfdetermination 
those remarks have not gone unnoticed sen connie mack rfla 
has criticized mandela for his support for the terrorist triad 
of castro gadhafi and arafat 
rep lawrence smith dfla pointedly boycotted mandelas 
address tuesday to a joint meeting of congress others like sen 
charles grassley riowa attended but withheld applause 
the washington post editorialized that it was hardly noble 
of mandela given the articulate way he portrays human rights 
conditions in his own country to decline comment on the 
ruthless even murderous places where the anc has allies 
on the question of use of force president bush said monday 
with mandela standing at his side that a resort to violence to 
resolve south africas problems is improper mandela replied that 
he could not renounce violence if peaceful efforts fail 
he drew criticism from some members of congress but rep howard 
wolpe dmich thinks bush is applying a double standard to south 
africa in demanding an end to violence 
only in the case of south africa has the doctrine of 
nonviolence emerged as a central element of our policy said 
wolpe chairman of the house foreign affairs africa subcommittee 
he said that in addition to invading panama and bombing libya 
the united states has armed resistance fighters on three 
continents in each case the us concluded that force was 
necessary as a last resort something mandela can identify with 
if we are forced to resort to violence he told bush monday 
it is because we have no alternative whatsoever

japanese and us negotiators today reached an 
agreement to help trim the 49 billion us trade deficit with 
japan they hailed the accord as an unprecedented step toward 
easing tensions between the two partners 
president bush and prime minister toshiki kaifu both issued 
statements saying the pact would enhance their countries global 
partnership and also benefit other countries 
i welcome and endorse this joint report bush said in 
washington as talks concluded at the foreign ministry in tokyo 
kaifu said japan may find it painful to implement the report 
however these measures are intended to achieve a major reform of 
the japanese economy in the consumers best interests he said 
both leaders said that while japan pledged in a 57page report a 
raft of measures to improve foreign companies access to its 
market washington had to reduce its budget deficit and improve the 
competitiveness of us industry 
kaifu praised bushs willingness to consider tax revenue 
increases as a deficitreduction move bush commended kaifu for 
his strong and courageous political leadership 
the negotiations ran through four grueling days an extension 
from the planned two days 
there had been concern that this round in the socalled 
structural impediments initiative might have to be continued next 
week to reach agreement 
linn williams the us deputy trade representative said 
it is a remarkable thing that these two economies have done i 
see this as a kind of joint leadership japan and the united states 
got together on difficult issues and worked together 
constructively we should be pleased with the efforts and results 
particularly prime minister kaifu and president bush can be 
proud they have done something no two other countries have done 
before he added 
bush and kaifu talked by telephone late wednesday about japans 
final increased offer to boost public works spending a key area of 
disagreement 
williams said the trade talks were an important influence on 
bushs tax move which is aimed at reducing the federal budget 
deficit the deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of the 
trade imbalance because it fuels us demand for consumption and 
imports from japan raising us tax revenues may thus reduce 
japanese exports and cut the trade imbalance 
bushs announcement was followed by a japanese compromise 
wednesday to increase planned public works spending that might 
help reduce the trade imbalance by increasing sales of us 
products and construction services in japan and soaking up some 
excess japanese savings and investment funds 
while bush risked political flak over taxes the japanese worry 
about adding to inflation with a big increase in public works 
spending 
the final draft shows japan agreed to 277 trillion in public 
works spending over 10 years up from 17 trillion in the 10 years 
to 1990 
other measures on the japanese side aimed at improving foreign 
companies access to the market include 
submitting legislation by march to release more land for 
housing and buildings and to curb high land prices 
attaining clearance within 24 hours of imports by 1991 
having the fair trade commission take more formal action in 
antimonopoly cases instead of quiet persuasion a bill is to go 
before the current session of parliament to raise fines to deter 
cartels 
having the commission increase its monitoring of transactions 
with the business groups called keiretsu to deter 
anticompetitive practices publicize findings enhance foreign 
companies ability to sell goods to companies in such groups 
amending the criminal code to increase fines against 
bidrigging 
using deregulation to speed the process for approving large 
retail stores widen liquor sales and open the distribution system 
increasing the number of patent examiners and other measures to 
shorten within five years the time to process patent applications 
from the current 37 months to 24 months 
surveying and publicizing differences between high japanese 
prices and foreign prices having the government implement 52 
measures that have been identified as likely to reduce such price 
differentials 
abolishing a law giving the government power to restrict direct 
foreign investment if it could affect similar japanese domestic 
businesses 
on the us side the federal budget deficit was the lead item 
and the report included the statement bush made tuesday accepting 
tax revenue increases a departure from his campaign promise 
of read my lips as a way to cut the deficit 
other american promises 
urging congress to pass a bill to create family savings 
accounts and other measures to increase the low us savings level 
increasing federal funding for research and development 
partially relaxing a ban on exports of california heavy crude 
oil 
creating more programs to promote exports 
enacting measures to reach goals of excellence in education and 
to improve the quality of the us work force

bloodless coup in 1982 the opposition accuses him of rigging votes 
to win subsequent presidential and parliamentary elections 
an opposition movement to force ershads resignation gathered 
strength in 1987 and early 1988 but dissipated amid differences 
between the two major opposition parties the awami league and the 
bangladesh nationalist party 
but the governments announcement this month to raise taxes has 
united the opposition again both major opposition parties said the 
proposals were antipeople and they jointly organized a 
nationwide strike june 17 
thursdays strike went on as scheduled despite an announcement 
by ershad on monday that he was slashing the tax proposals and 
would not place any levies on kerosene oil edible oil soap and 
salt 
opposition leaders said the cuts were not enough and demanded 
dropping of all new taxes and ershads resignation 
the annual per capita income of bangladesh one of the poorest 
countries in the world is about 168

layoffs and lower pay for workers have 
undermined social stability in china after last years military 
march into tiananmen square the cia told congress on thursday 
the agency predicted that part of a 15 percent increase in 
chinese military spending will go to raise pay and bolster troop 
morale after several years of inflation running over 10 percent 
when inflation is taken into account it will be the first increase 
in military spending in six years 
a significant portion probably will also go to purchase 
new equipment such as riotcontrol gear for military 
rapidreaction units and repaying the operational costs incurred 
by the military in enforcing martial law in beijing and lhasa 
during 1989 the report said 
it gave a dark view of chinas situation 
growing unemployment which has reached its highest level in 
a decade and falling urban living standards are undermining 
beijings efforts to reestablish the countrys social stability 
which remains tenuous a year following the governments suppression 
of the prodemocracy demonstrations it said 
the cia report was given to the joint economic committee 
it quoted a hong kong press report not further identified as 
saying that there had been more than 600 cases of worker unrest in 
china in the last half of 1989 these included strikes slowdowns 
demonstrations and rallies 
according to many accounts layoffs have created an embittered 
and volatile class of unemployed workers it went on 
the report estimated that 60 million to 80 million workers have 
no regular jobs but move from place to place 
sen jeff bingaman who presided at the hearing said that if 
the cia assessment is correct chinas economy is in cold storage 
the reform movement has been frozen partway between central 
planning and a free market the new mexico democrat added 
the cia said that chinas national income grew less than 4 
percent last year compared with growth of about 12 percent a year 
earlier in the first five months of 1990 chinas industry was 
increasing production at a rate of less than 2 percent annually 
the governments budget deficit grew to a record 8 billion 
dollars though it is small compared with the deficit of many other 
countries 
prospects are dim for china to return to an allout move toward 
a market economy the report said that is the direction being 
taken by eastern european countries formerly under communist rule

mario cuomo is promoting a bailout tax on the 
rich doug wilder is calling for an inquiry lloyd bentsen is 
lecturing on greed and bob kerrey is pounding at misplaced 
priorities 
its only 1990 but democrats are seizing on the savings and 
loan mess that 200billionplus taxpayer nightmare as a chance 
to revive their party and help them win the white house in 1992 
this is going to play to the most damaging republican 
dimensions that they side with business and the rich predicts 
harrison hickman a democratic polling consultant 
republicans too are out to score political points by blaming 
the democrats 
theyre democrats not going to sweep across that field 
without a lot of casualties gop strategist kevin phillips said 
hardly anyone disputes that democrats and republicans alike set 
in motion the 1980s deregulation process that ultimately led to the 
collapse of the sampl industry 
democrats as well as republicans took money from sampl operators 
and lobbied federal regulators on their behalf in fact four of 
five senators under investigation in connection with such 
activities are democrats 
but the democrats prompted in part by phillips own new 
critique of governmentfostered greed and glitz during the 
reagan years are aggressively defining the sampl debacle early and 
in their own terms 
depict the scandal as a symbol of 1980s greed and excess the 
party is telling its candidates and operatives call for a return 
to economic policies that dont favor the rich question president 
bushs priorities and his management of the sampl bailout 
democratic national chairman ron brown is expected to outline an 
sampl campaign strategy friday at a meeting of state party chairmen 
but the new theme already is a staple on the political circuit and 
a refrain in some congressional races that could be dress 
rehearsals for the 1992 presidential race 
its unclear whether the party will try to blame the sampl bailout 
for bushs acknowledgment this week that tax increases are needed 
but at least one challenger lost no time in doing so 
one of the reasons bush is going to renege on his promise not 
to raise taxes is the cost of the sampl bailout california 
democrat calvin dooley said wednesday he said he intends to tell 
voters that rep charles pashayan his opponent is one person 
that people can hold accountable 
pashayan and rep denny smith of oregon are two republicans with 
sampl problems democratic reps frank annunzio of illinois and doug 
barnard of georgia have similar woes 
campaign contributions from sampl operators are among the 
thriftrelated issues at stake in the annunzio barnard and 
pashayan races smith is taking heat for seeking regulatory favors 
for a failing sampl while he served on its board 
annunzio chairs a banking subcommittee that the gop says did 
nothing to avert the crisis annunzio contends the republicans are 
merely upset by his criticism of neil bush the presidents son 
who is being investigated for his role in the 1 billion silverado 
thrift failure in colorado 
the democratic assault led white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater to launch a counterattack last week there are a lot of 
battles that can be fought on this turf and were ready 
fitzwater said contending that the democrats have a big role 
in the collapse 
among those fitzwater singled out was nebraska sen kerrey 
mentioned often as a 1992 prospect kerrey is credited with coining 
the phrase savings and loan president in a cutting reference to 
bushs spending priorities and his 1988 campaign pledge to be the 
education president 
along with jesse jackson kerrey was a pioneer in aggressive sampl 
rhetoric but theyre no longer alone 
new york gov cuomo another potential presidential candidate 
neatly packaged most of the democratic themes this week in a 
proposal for a tax on the richest people in the country 
presumably the kind of people who are involved in savings and 
loans to finance the bailout and ease the future burden on our 
children 
texas sen bentsen the 1988 vice presidential candidate blames 
the scandal not on deregulation but what party officials like to 
call desupervision 
in 1981 we had 54 sampl regulators in texas in 1985 we had 
12 bentsen told his state party this month the republicans 
looked for easy shortterm savings and they ended up stiffing the 
american taxpayer with a bill for greed and mismanagement that 
could reach half a trillion dollars 
virginia gov wilder testing the waters in iowa and new 
hampshire this month called the sampl mess the worst scandal in 
our countrys history and has told bush that an independent 
inquiry is needed 
when the president recently made a show of adding money to step 
up sampl prosecutions wilder retorted you mean you just found out 
about it today

another cold war has ended not with a bang but a 
sniffle 
the common cold research center is closing saturday having 
conceded defeat after 44 years in which thousands of noses were 
bombarded with viruses in the quest for a cure for the common cold 
administrator arthur amos insists that the 18000 volunteers who 
passed through the hospital near salisbury 80 miles west of 
london did not suffer in vain 
going back in time we used to think there was only one cold 
virus now we know there are nearly 200 so there is no chance of 
finding a vaccine amos said weve been trying to find a 
compound that acts on a family of viruses but weve had no luck 
some of the centers discoveries cannot be explained amos said 
why for example did onethird of volunteers never show any signs 
of a cold while the others exposed to the same virus coughed 
sneezed and felt miserable 
blood tests at the beginning of the trial and at the end often 
show changes in antibody levels which means even if it didnt seem 
like they have a cold they have a subclinical cold amos said 
the volunteers received no medication amos said unless they 
were in extreme discomfort in which case they got aspirin 
the research center was housed in the harvard hospital so named 
because it was sent to britain by the harvard medical school in 
1940 
during world war ii it was an american military field hospital 
and in 1946 it was turned over to the common cold project 
the volunteers who learned of the project through newspaper 
advertisements and wordofmouth ranged in age from 18 to 50 and 
some were repeat participants one couple met there and returned 
the following year for their honeymoon one man went through the 
10day quarantined program 26 times but amos said he was a 
rather odd sort of person 
many participants came to vacation at the center nestled in 
rolling countryside in the shadow of the 404foot spire atop 
salisbury cathedral englands highest spire 
two or three volunteers shared each of the centers 12 
apartments 
we usually have a flat empty in reserve in case theyre 
imcompatible but in the main they usually get along amos said 
the volunteers were barred from salisbury and neighboring 
villages and had to keep at least 30 feet away from anyone but 
their roommates or the gowned masked medical staff 
if they were on a walk and couldnt avoid meeting someone 
they were told to put a paper tissue over their nose and walk by 
quick said amos 
most volunteers came out of curiosity amos said not for the 
money a paltry daily sum of pocket money now set at 3 
there was also a certain feeling that they were working to 
help medical research that voluntary spirit he said its 
pretty here and very quiet if you live in the rougher spots of 
liverpool or london this is the total opposite 
amos who has had only one cold in his six years at the center 
will work for three more months overseeing its closure 
the medical research council which had provided the centers 1 
million in annual funding decided the unit would close after 
director david tyrell retired 
it was so much his work that it was not really viable without 
him a council spokeswoman said

a leading rightwing politician said thursday 
that israel intends to expand jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories despite us warnings that this could jeopardize 
american aid to israel 
we will expand settlements whenever and wherever we can 
said geula cohen deputy science minister and a leader of the 
rightwing tehiya party we dont have to cave in to us 
pressure 
ms cohen refused to confirm reports that there was an unwritten 
agreement between her party and the dominant likud bloc specifying 
construction of 5000 new units each year in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
the hebrew daily haaretz reported that a pact between likud and 
its rightwing coalition partners stipulates that 5000 new housing 
units will be constructed each year in existing settlements 
the newspaper said the rightwing parties had agreed to expand 
existing settlements instead of building new ones as a tactical 
move to try to avoid us criticism 
the haaretz report calculated that by the end of the likud 
governments term in 2 years the number of jewish settlers in the 
occupied lands would exceed 120000 there currently are at least 
75000 jewish settlers living in 130 settlements in the occupied 
territories the government has said 
even the current estimate of settlers may be low haaretz said 
the newspaper said its own survey found 84000 settlers living in 
the west bank and 4000 in gaza 
haaretz also said that 1050 new housing units are under 
construction and could house 6800 more settlers when they are 
completed this fall 
the territories which are home to 17 million palestinians 
were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war the united states opposes settling soviet jewish 
immigrants in the territories saying it is an obstacle to making 
peace with the palestinians 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner dismissed 
the newspaper report as pure speculation but said its 
obvious that nobody has sought to put limits on existing 
settlements 
the statements came a day after us rep david obey chairman 
of the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations 
warned that he would support cutting israels annual 3 billion in 
foreign aid if it persists in expanding the settlements 
shamir formed a narrow rightwing government earlier this month 
after a coalition with the leftleaning labor party collapsed over 
how to proceed with middle east peace efforts 
likuds partners in the new coalition include three ultraright 
nationalist factions tehiya tsomet and moledet that are 
committed to expanding jewish presence in the territories 
benny katzover a west bank settlement leader said there were 
plans for thickening existing settlements but he would not say 
how many new units might be built 
construction is going on all the time and it will continue 
he said we are relying on sharon he added referring to 
housing minister ariel sharon sharon is an ardent supporter of the 
settlement movement and he created a fresh stir thursday by 
proposing emergency regulations to speed construction of 
housing for soviet immigrants 
the regulations sought by sharon would allow his ministry to 
seize private land for construction possibly bypassing laws 
protecting archaeological sites and nature reserves critics said 
settlements have come under heavy scrutiny in recent months 
because of arab criticism over israels policy of allowing some 
soviet jewish immigrants to move to the occupied territories 
the arabs fear palestinians may be displaced and that their 
efforts to form an independent state will be undermined 
israel says that only only a fraction of the more than 52000 
soviet jews who have come here in the last year have moved to the 
occupied lands it is seeking 400 million in loan guarantees from 
the united states to help house the soviet immigrants

1933 when she and her husband the late playwright charles 
macarthur moved into the 21room house

they were emeralds

the supreme court on thursday agreed to decide 
what power federal judges have to impose prison sentences stiffer 
than those called for by new guidelines 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a former federal 
employee convicted of embezzlingrelated charges who said he was 
not given fair warning that the judge intended to exceed the 
guidelines 
the new sentencing guidelines took effect in 1987 culminating a 
decadelong effort to overhaul the old system that many said 
created unjustified sentencing disparities the new rules were 
drawn up by a sevenmember commission appointed by congress 
the guidelines remain controversial with many defendants and 
some judges saying they improperly curb judicial discretion and 
give prosecutors too much power 
the justices are expected to announce a decision in the case 
next year 
the defendant william j burns was sentenced to five years in 
prison although he pleaded guilty with the understanding the 
maximum penalty would be 37 months 
burns was charged with embezzling 12 million in government 
funds from 1982 to 1988 while he was a financial supervisor with 
the agency for international development he also was convicted of 
tax evasion for failing to pay 475685 in taxes on the money 
prosecutors said he stole 
prosecutors said burns diverted aid travel funds into a bank 
account in the fictitious name of vincent kaufman and later claimed 
the money was in payment for phony furniture moving expenses 
authorities said they discovered the embezzlement when a routine 
security check revealed that burns whose annual salary was 35000 
a year owned a 400000 house 
he pleaded guilty under an agreement with federal prosecutors 
that called for him to be sentenced under new guidelines that set a 
maximum of 37 months in prison for such crimes 
but us district judge norma johnson imposed the stiffer 
sentence without having informed him in advance that she was 
considering the harsher penalty 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington upheld the 
sentence in january 
the appeals court said the guidelines permit judges to impose 
stiffer or milder sentences if there are special aggravating or 
mitigating circumstances 
the trial court is best situated to decide the length of the 
sentence and its finding should not be reversed unless it is 
arbitrary or capricious the appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected burnss claim that he was in 
effect blindsided because he was not given an adequate opportunity 
by the judge to challenge her plans to depart from the guidelines 
the appeals court said since the defendant had an opportunity 
to address the court before sentencing and has a right to 
appeal his sentence he has not been harmed by the trial courts 
lack of notice 
unless congress amends the guidelines the appeals court said 
the rules do not require the judge to warn defendants in advance 
that sentences may exceed the guidelines 
the justice department urged the supreme court to reject burnss 
appeal 
the high court ruled last year that the guidelines do not 
violate constitutionally required separation of powers between the 
three branches of government the justices did not decide whether 
the new system may violate the rights of defendants 
the case acted on thursday is burns vs us 897260

four months after the supreme court eased the 
rules on welfare benefits for disabled children the government 
cant agree with the plaintiffs on who may be owed money or the 
best way to find them 
the dispute has delayed the process of trying to locate hundreds 
of thousands of poor children who the court said were wrongly 
denied supplemental security income benefits 
the decision gave the children the right to have their cases 
reviewed total back benefits are expected to reach from 1 billion 
to 2 billion 
but the government has not yet paid a dime the social security 
administration has been arguing with the childrens attorneys over 
many facets of the case including lawyers fees and how many cases 
should be included 
childrens lawyers estimate more than 600000 denials need to 
reevaluated the government says about 280000 children are 
affected 
frankly in over 20 years of litigating similar cases we 
cannot recall a single case in which government counsel were more 
obstructive or belligerent philadelphia attorney jonathan m 
stein said in a june 18 letter to the justice department 
its unfortunate deputy ssa commissioner louis enoff said 
in an interview we wanted to make every effort to move quickly 
to reach every child that is potentially eligible i still would 
like to do that 
sen john heinz rpa said he fears the government could be 
inadvertently destroying case files from the 1980s and 1970s 
necessary for children to prove they deserve benefits 
but ssa said systemwide computer safeguards prevented that i 
dont mean to tell you that somewhere in the past there may not 
have been a file destroyed enoff said sometimes a folder gets 
lost or destroyed accidentally but we have developed a class 
action tracking system 
more than 290000 poor disabled children receive ssi benefits 
which vary from state to state and range from 386 to about 700 a 
month 
by a 72 vote on feb 20 the supreme court voided a government 
regulation that gave children seeking the benefits less protection 
than adults the department of health and human services rule had 
applied a rigid list of disorders to children while permitting 
adults to be judged individually on their ability to work 
stein the childrens attorney in the classaction lawsuit said 
the decision should force officials to reevaluate 600000 denials 
going back to 1974 when the regulation was enacted 
but the social security administration says legal precedent 
requires that they only go back to 1983 when the case was 
originally filed on behalf of brian zebley then 5 of upland pa 
brian who suffers from congenital brain damage lost his ssi 
benefits when an administrative law judge concluded that his 
medical conditions did not meet government requirements there have 
been about 280000 denials since then that now should be reviewed 
according to ssa 
both sides have indicated a willingness to compromise on how 
many reviews should be undertaken the administration accuses stein 
of delaying negotiations by unreasonably seeking 6 million in 
legal and other fees in the case 
most regrettably your compensation demands have precluded a 
settlement which not only would have brought an end to this 
longstanding litigation but most importantly would have been very 
fair and equitable to members of the zebley class stuart licht 
of the justice departments civil division said in a june 8 letter 
to stein 
its a total lie said stein he said he has sought 12 
million for work done between 1983 and the court decision plus 
unspecified fees for the past four months

terrorists could knock out electrical power to 
an american city by using storebought rifles on carefully chosen 
targets congressional researchers said thursday 
armed with highpowered rifles available from any gun store and 
some basic engineering knowledge terrorists could wreak havoc 
without having to get past a single guard at generating plants 
robin roy of the congressional office of technology assessment told 
the senate government affairs committee 
two or three knowledgeable individuals using only readily 
available offtheshelf supplies could destroy enough facilities 
to cause a shortterm blackout over a metropolitan area followed 
by months of reduced reliability and rotating power outages during 
peak periods roy told the panel which is investigating the 
vulnerability of power plants to terrorists hurricanes and 
earthquakes 
when asked what he meant by readily available 
offtheshelf roy said rifles if you know what to shoot 
at 
alan taft crane of the ota testified that transmission lines are 
vulnerable to rifle fire such damage can be repaired quickly 
but the saboteur can repeat it even more quickly he said many 
such quick attacks would have much the same effect on the system as 
eliminating key facilities 
blackouts can causes millions of dollars in damage to utilities 
and public services not to mention lost business and looting the 
report noted a 1977 blackout in new york city and neighboring 
westchester county lasted a full day and caused losses of nearly 
350 million 
although power systems can usually withstand hurricanes the 
lingering local blackouts following hurricane hugo demonstrated 
that more advance preparation may be warranted crane said 
facilities can be designed to withstand earthquakes as they 
are in california but less prepared areas including the central 
mississippi valley the southern appalachians and the indiana 
region are also vulnerable to major shocks crane said 
the ota report also noted economic roadblocks to recovery from 
serious disasters growing foreign control of the electrical 
equipment manufacturing industry and decreasing investment by power 
companies in backup capacity

the supreme court permanently blocked the 
execution of an arizona killer thursday a day after upholding the 
death penalty law under which he had been sentenced one attorney 
general called the sequence a complete fluke 
two of the justices who voted with the majority in the 54 
decision upholding the state law did not take part in thursdays 
action turning wednesdays dissenters into a 43 majority for the 
one case 
in a brief order the justices refused to reinstate the death 
sentence of john harvey adamson convicted of murdering phoenix 
newspaper reporter don bolles in 1976 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1988 threw out 
adamsons death sentence after striking down a provision in arizona 
law that lets judges instead of juries choose between life and 
death for convicted murderers 
the appeals courts ruling called into doubt the validity of 
death penalty laws in idaho and montana which also allow for 
sentencing by judges but the arizona provision was declared 
constitutional wednesday by the supreme court in the case of 
another arizona killer 
thursdays confusing turn of events came about because justices 
sandra day oconnor a former state judge in arizona and anthony 
m kennedy a former 9th circuit court judge did not participate 
in adamsons case 
that left only chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white and antonin scalia voting to grant arizonas appeal 
and set aside the 9th circuit courts ruling in the adamson case 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall harry a 
blackmun and john paul stevens who voted wednesday to strike down 
arizonas death penalty law voted to deny arizonas appeal 
the net result both the 1988 appeals court ruling and a 
contradictory supreme court decision are on the books 
the practical effect adamson cannot be sentenced to death 
a surprised arizona attorney general bob corbin said as we 
see it the arizona death penalty statute is constitutional but 
it doesnt apply to adamson 
its a crazy decision but thats what they voted corbin 
said 
idaho attorney general jim jones called the sequence of events 
ridiculous but predicted that thursdays action would affect 
no death row inmate but adamson 
it really means not too much more than adamson is going to get 
off because of a complete fluke and the work of the judges of the 
9th circuit court jones said 
prosecutors said adamson was paid 100000 to attach a bomb to 
the car of bolles who had been investigating organized crime for 
the arizona republic in phoenix bolles died june 11 1976 nine 
days after his car exploded 
before dying bolles identified adamson as the man who had made 
an appointment to see him the day of the bombing 
adamson originally was allowed to plead guilty to seconddegree 
murder in exchange for his testimony against two others allegedly 
involved in the murder plot 
his testimony helped convict max dunlap a building contractor 
and james robison a plumber 
but the arizona supreme court threw out the dunlap and robison 
convictions in 1980 and ordered a new trial for them the two have 
not been retried 
adamson who by 1980 was serving a 20year prison term said he 
would not testify at a new trial unless the state met additional 
conditions including his release and the governments help in 
establishing a new identity 
after adamsons refusal to cooperate state prosecutors filed 
firstdegree murder charges against him he was tried convicted 
and sentenced to death 
the 9th circuit court threw out adamsons death sentence in 
1986 ruling he had been subjected to double jeopardy the 
supreme court reversed that ruling and reinstated the death 
sentence by a 54 vote in 1987 
the high courts 198990 term ended wednesday as the justices 
recessed until oct 1 but they left behind orders in various cases 
that were released by the court clerk thursday 
in other orders the court 
agreed to study the appeal of a rhode island college ordered to 
pay nearly 44000 to a former nursing student kicked out because 
she was too fat 
refused to block an investigation into alleged misconduct by c 
vernon mason a lawyer who represented tawana brawley the black 
new york teenager who said she was the victim of a racially 
motivated assault 
agreed to decide whether an indiana woman may sue the 
prosecutor she says violated her rights by advising police to 
hypnotize her before asking questions about the shootings of her 
children

us and japanese trade negotiators agreed thursday 
to drastic economic changes to help cut the 49 billion us trade 
deficit with japan officials said the unprecedented pact would 
improve the quality of life in both countries 
in the wideranging accord the united states agreed to raise 
its tax revenues japan said it would spent 1 trillion more on 
public works in the next decade the two measures are aimed at 
helping close the trade gap and easing trade friction 
i welcome and endorse this joint report president bush said 
in washington as the talks ended at the foreign ministry in tokyo 
prime minister toshiki kaifu said that carrying out the reforms 
would be painful however these measures are intended to achieve 
a major reform of the japanese economy in the consumers best 
interests he said 
kaifu praised bushs willingness to consider tax revenue 
increases at the risk of a strong political backlash bush 
commended kaifu for his strong and courageous political 
leadership 
linn williams the us deputy trade representative called the 
agreement which followed telephone consultations between bush and 
kaifu on wednesday night something no two other countries have 
done before 
williams said the talks were an important influence on 
bushs tax move which is aimed at reducing the federal budget 
deficit the deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of other 
economic ills in the united states including the trade imbalance 
after four days of intensive talks haggard but happy trade 
officials emerged with the 57page report that included bushs 
decision wednesday to raise tax revenues a departure from his 
campaign promise of no new taxes 
the report also carried a pledge by japan to spend 277 
trillion over the next 10 years on public works projects to 
stimulate demand for imports and help offset this nations huge 
reservoir of savings japan has spent 17 trillion in the past 10 
years 
the decision on public works represented a major compromise 
us officials had sought a 10year 322 trillion package but 
japanese officials resisted increasing their original offer of 
268 trillion because of fears of inflation 
we think that plan along with president bushs plan would go 
a long way toward reducing the imbalance between japan and the 
united states said john b taylor of the council of economic 
advisers 
he said the reforms were expected to have a gradual but lasting 
impact on japans trade surplus with the united states which 
totaled 49 billion last year 
earlier officials said the results of the reforms were expected 
to show up within two or three years 
many of the reforms are indirectly related to trade flows 
the agreement also called for japan to increase penalties for 
violations of antimonopoly laws facilitate legal action against 
unfair business practices and crack down on collusion and 
bidrigging the measures are intended to make japanese business 
more open to foreign competition 
japan also promised new policies to slow real estate inflation 
and encourage more efficient land use the steps would help lower 
the cost of doing business in japan and improve the quality of life 
for average japanese who cannot afford to buy new homes 
japan agreed to relax restrictions on retail sales to let in 
more imports and open new business opportunities 
in addition to stronger action on the budget deficit washington 
pledged to urge congress to enact laws on family savings accounts 
and other measures to help increase us savings and investment 
the united states said it also would enact measures to improve 
education and worker training as a longterm investment in the 
quality of the us work force washington also promised to develop 
programs to promote exports while easing restrictions on oil 
exports 
officials on both sides expressed satisfaction with the report 
from the talks formally known as the structural impediments 
initiative 
we believe that this report is a historic document that 
contains wideranging commitments and actions with significant 
benefits for both economies the us delegation said in a 
statement issued after the talks ended 
foreign minister taro nakayama said the measures were needed to 
improve japanese living standards and ensure that relations 
between the japanese economy and the rest of the world economy are 
less tense and more harmonious 
some analysts have expressed doubts the fundamental reforms 
envisioned would actually occur particularly changes in ingrained 
business habits that have long gone untouched by fair trade 
regulators 
williams acknowledged the proof will be in what really 
happens but he said the us delegation was optimistic 
we believe their intentions are genuine he said

this weeks us supreme court abortion ruling already has 
spurred new efforts in at least one state to make minors tell their 
parents before getting an abortion 
in rulings on ohio and minnesota laws the high court said a 
state may require a minor unmarried girl to notify one or both 
parents before having an abortion provided she has the option of 
getting a judges permission 
on thursday a new jersey lawmaker introduced a bill for 
oneparent notification and other states are expected to see a 
wave of legislative proposals 
im trying to bring back family relationships parents have to 
assume responsibility for children said state sen francis 
mcmanimon the sponsor of the new jersey bill 
new jersey had a one notification bill pending the new one was 
designed to conform with mondays supreme court ruling that 
decision could spur enforcement of abortion restrictions for minors 
in at least nine states 
at least 23 states have laws that require a minor to obtain the 
consent of one or both parents before having an abortion eleven 
states have laws requiring a girl simply to notify one or both 
parents a judges permission can be substituted in some states 
but many of the laws havent been enforced or have been blocked 
by the courts some awaiting the high courts ruling 
these are going to spring to life and i predict most of the 
other states will place similar laws on the books said dr john 
willke president of the national right to life committee in 
washington dc 
a flood of abortion bills followed the supreme courts 1989 
webster ruling which permitted greater state limits on abortion 
but few survived a backlash from abortionrights advocates 
about 350 bills have been considered in state legislatures since 
webster said kate michelman president of the national abortion 
rights action league 
well see that many and more than that in the coming year 
she said youre going to see efforts to go beyond parental 
consent parental notification there will be further attempts to 
undermine roe 
the supreme courts 1973 decision in roe vs wade established 
the right to an abortion 
minnesotas notification law could be back in effect in 30 days 
said the states chief deputy attorney general jack tunheim it 
went into effect in 1981 but was ruled unconstitutional in 1986 
half the 7200 teenagers who got abortions during that time 
sought a judges permission and all but eight had their petitions 
approved according to thomas webber executive director of planned 
parenthood of minnesota 
ohios notification law was never enforced while appeals were 
pending 
arkansas and west virginia already enforce their notification 
laws and utah requires parental notification if possible 
appeals courts were waiting for the high courts decision before 
ruling on consent or notification laws from georgia kentucky and 
tennessee 
the ruling also could revive laws in illinois nebraska idaho 
maryland mississippi and nevada that were either blocked or 
havent been enforced 
abortion foes in oregon have begun a petition drive to get a 
notification measure on the november ballot in michigan opponents 
are collecting signatures to get a vetoproof bill into the 
legislature gov james blanchard vetoed a parental consent law 
this year 
an antiabortion spokeswoman in montana thinks the supreme court 
ruling could pave the way for a notification law in that state 
given the supreme court decision i think many more 
legislators would be confident to vote for that said linda 
sargent executive director of montana right to life 
but some wisconsin lawmakers said the latest decision wont sway 
legislators a consent bill passed in the assembly but died in a 
senate committee last year 
i dont think these decisions will change attitudes or votes 
on this important issue said senate majority leader joseph 
strohl

the peace contentment and good will 
in renfro valley have been shaken 
the picturesque hollow that the late entertainer john lair 
described in his song the valley where time stands still is now 
the scene of a battle over rights to its name 
lair turned the valley 50 miles south of lexington into an 
entertainment center when he founded the renfro valley barn dance 
in 1939 his song described the valley as a place of peace and 
content and good will 
but that began to change last year when three investors bought 
the 110acre property that lair had trademarked and copyrighted 
the new owners renfro valley folks inc plan to turn the complex 
near interstate 75 into a 35 million countrymusic theme park 
the investors maintain that the purchase included the exclusive 
use of the renfro valley name 
several business owners in the unincorporated hamlet of about 75 
people balked when the new owners ordered them to stop using the 
words renfro valley in store names and merchandise 
when we bought john lairs property we also purchased the 
country music museum restaurant motel and records said ralph 
gabbard president of renfro valley folks 
he had many federal trademarks and we filed for others all 
were doing is what walt disney did before he went into orlando 
or california what were trying to do is protect the good name 
the renfro valley complex includes a new 1530seat auditorium 
the old renfro valley barn dance building old jamboree building a 
recently completed turnofthecentury crafts village a restaurant 
and motel and a country music museum 
valley business owners claim they have as much right to the 
renfro valley name as renfro valley folks 
this valley will be 200 years old next year said ailene 
collinsworth who owns renfro valley country store with her 
husband willard its been called renfro valley all that time 
my family has lived in the valley for over 30 years 
the store has been selling cups spoons caps and hats 
emblazoned with renfro valley for more than 15 years she said 
renfro valley folks filed a lawsuit june 18 in us district 
court in london ky seeking to stop renfro valley record shop 
from using the name 
store owner joe allen said he offered to compromise by dropping 
renfro valley in exchange for the right to sell records and 
tapes from the entertainment company without paying royalties 
an attorney for renfro valley folks said wednesday that an 
agreement had been reached with allen that would be signed monday 
but that was news to allen 
i havent heard a word from them he said thursday they 
want to license the products in my store i dont have to ask them 
what i can sell its my store not theirs i will never pay 
royalties they do not own my business 
said mrs collinsworth we know they have the trademark on 
renfro valley folks we dont want what belongs to them but we 
want what belongs to us they want to trademark everything 
they want to keep us little folks from selling that but thats our 
living too

raging wildfires set by arsonists 
burned more than 300 homes in southern california as winddriven 
flames left over 14000 acres of parched brush blackened today 
fortysix firefighters were injured working fire lines 
throughout the region including two prison inmates critically 
burned in riverside county 
a 3500acre blaze destroyed 280 homes in santa barbara county 
late wednesday and continued to burn today in a canyon north of 
santa barbara 
homeowners in this coastal community today surveyed charred lots 
where flames torched rows of expensive homes but skipped through 
the air to spare others one serious injury was reported 
it was a beautiful neighborhood eric lim said as the 
remains of his house smoldered behind him 
i cant find anything theres nothing nancy harvey said 
her hands picking through what was once the kitchen of her dream 
home im hoping to find my address book 
the fire is incredible it came down from the mountains it 
spread everywhere it burned everything in its path said tim 
grasey spokesman for the santa barbara county sheriffs department 
from santa barbara to san diego thousands of people were 
rousted from homes 
santa barbara residents alerted by smoke neighbors and roving 
us forest service crews packed what they could and fled in cars 
or on foot 
the trees were lighting up like torches said resident dave 
williams who was just watching the fire until he realized that 
this is serious business i could die in this stuff 
the fires were worsened by four years of drought and a searing 
heat wave that pushed temperatures to record levels well above 100 
degrees water reserves were at their lowest levels in years 
hot desert winds up to 60 mph fanned the santa barbara fire 
wednesday us forest service spokeswoman susan mockenhaupt said 
dropping temperatures and winds tamed the fire overnight 
leaving only isolated hot spots but fire officials refused to 
declare it contained today saying they feared winds could fan the 
flames again 
in one subdivision every home was gutted every street a 
landscape of chimneys and charred kitchen appliances occasionally 
a geyser of flame shot from a gas main giving the scene a hellish 
look workers rushed to shut off gas lines 
the fire also destroyed businesses and a school for handicapped 
adults set a fire station ablaze and prompted evacuation of the 
county jail it shut down traffic on us highway 101 and cut off 
rail service 
authorities blamed arson saying they found an incendiary 
device ashes filled the sky more than 35 miles from the blaze 
in arizona meanwhile fire burned out of control today in tonto 
national forest where six firefighters were killed tuesday in 
montrose colo a lightningsparked fire in the ponderosa burned 
at least 1000 acres 
santa barbara countys blaze was its first of that magnitude 
since a 1977 fire burned 234 homes in the area which is on the 
pacific coast 100 miles northwest of los angeles its property 
values were among the states highest 
it looks like a war zone out there grasey said 
everything is blackened its just total devastation you never 
felt more helpless you look at it and theres nothing you could do 
to stop it 
brenda rein watched from a shopping mall as the fire marched 
down a mountain 
the whole sky was just orange i looked up and saw the moon 
through the smoke kind of a werewolf moon she said 
barbara jefferson of santa barbara came out of a movie theater 
to find the evening sky raining soot and the wind blowing so 
fiercely it was hard to stand in the distant hills she said we 
just saw mountains of flames 
police in the los angeles suburb of glendale today said they 
were seeking two people for questioning in connection with a 
deliberately set fire that destroyed or damaged 55 homes there 
wednesday the homes were valued at 300000 to 700000 each and 
property losses were estimated at 30 million

chick corea and bobby mcferrin out to have fun 
and break some musical ground wasted no time at the jvc jazz 
festival making clear which of those aims comes first 
grammywinning vocalist mcferrin strutted to his stool wednesday 
night at carnegie hall sat down and began bouncing up and down 
corea the modern legend in jazz composing perched over his bench 
and flipped his long shirt tails backward over his head then 
grinned 
something was up 
they were a perfect match for a disarmingly entertaining evening 
of improvisation oneonone two of the most adventuresome artists 
around sounded together like the tom and jerry of jazz with a 
healthy dose of cool 
this was a fantastic combo that should be seen everywhere 
after a bit of silly improv to warm up the pair opened with a 
rendition of autumn leaves that quickly evolved into an 
experiment in sound and laughs that would set the tone for the 
twohour concert 
mcferrins expansive voice and coreas ebullient acoustic piano 
sounded nearly like a full band mcferrin threw in some trombone 
licks while keeping the bass line humming from somewhere in his 
chest corea plucked the pianos strings to add the beat 
soon they both were leaning into the grand piano backs nearly 
to the audience drumming on its frame and yelping and finding 
sounds in the instrument that steinway never imagined 
the duo brought the audience fully into the show in the second 
half mcferrin hopped between two spots on the stage that he 
designated ee and ahh with a hop he had the nearly full 
house belting ahh then ee while corea added discordant 
tones of his own 
mcferrin would venture into the crowd several times before the 
concert finished in one flurry he had the audience pass a glass 
of water from front to back then had them pass towels and when at 
a loss for more props offered himself and traversed carnegies 35 
rows horizontally 
humor was the key to the show but it never masked talent 
corea in the second half came up with a delightfully spry 
rendition of his own spain with mcferrin adding the full 
orchestra and chorus 
corea also brought out the serious side of the performance and 
at times seemed barely able to keep from becoming mcferrins 
straight man 
but each performer tapped his own highly energized imagination 
style and personality to make the concert work in a way few others 
could the men clearly understand each other after just three 
concerts together and both exuded mcferrins concertending advice 
go bonkers for at least one hour a day

lithuanias legislators began debating 
a freeze of their declaration of independence thursday and some 
questioned whether mikhail s gorbachev has the credibility or 
staying power to stick to a compromise 
lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene told the supreme 
council parliament that gorbachev had promised to end an economic 
blockade and begin negotiations if lithuania places a moratorium on 
the march 11 declaration 
she suggested a resolution that would impose a threemonth 
moratorium to take effect when negotiations with the kremlin 
actually begin mrs prunskiene told parliament gorbachev will not 
require a freeze on laws that followed the declaration of 
independence one of those laws replaced the soviet constitution 
with a lithuanian document 
the moratorium is only on the declaration of independence not 
on all the other acts mrs prunskiene told parliament its a 
political statement 
the status of lithuania doesnt change and the supreme council 
remains the same she said pressing parliament to accept a 
compromise 
parliament adjourned thursday without making a decision but 
mrs prunskienes assurances were not enough for many legislators 
we fear that if we accept this moscow would immediately 
install an alternative government said legislator klemas inta 
we fear that they could deceive us 
lithuania was an independent country between the world wars but 
was occupied by soviet soldiers in 1940 and absorbed into the 
soviet union 
there is a panic in the country that we might be tricked 
said newspaper editor algis cekuolis 
inta pointed to the mound of letters the parliament has received 
from people opposing any suspension of the declaration of 
independence despite gorbachevs blockade 
about 50000 workers have lost their jobs since the kremlin cut 
all oil most natural gas and other raw materials and manufactured 
goods 10 weeks ago the blockade is barely visible in vilnius the 
lithuanian capital most workers still are earning vacation pay 
hot water is flowing and there is no need for heat 
as a result there is little sign of the economic sanctions 
wearing down the republics determination 
several hundred people gathered outside parliament during the 
debate thursday to protest the moratorium proposal 
you cannot give yourself up into captivity said engineer 
richardas nomicas a compromise is needed but this is not it 
mrs prunskiene told parliament it must accept a deal because 
the west is demanding a compromise and the economic blockade could 
turn lithuania into a disaster area by winter 
the kremlin released a statement late tuesday saying talks with 
lithuania cannot begin until the republic declares a moratorium on 
its independence declaration it said the talks can only be held in 
the framework of a nationwide discussion of a new treaty of union 
among republics 
one member of parliament eduardas vilkas said after listening 
to mrs prunskiene that he understood her to be requesting a 
political step to say that gorbachev is not the loser 
vilkas said he favored a compromise but warned that many 
lithuanian legislators oppose a deal this is very difficult 
psychologically for many deputies he said 
lithuanias president vytautas landsbergis told the parliament 
he would speak in more detail on the proposed deal friday 
on thursday landsbergis did not endorse a compromise but said 
its most important to get the negotiations started in 
response to a question he said he understood from talks with 
gorbachev that the economic blockade would be lifted immediately 
when the moratorium went into effect 
landsbergis said the lithuanian leadership wanted to choose the 
best conditions for entering critical talks over just how 
independence could be achieved 
there was no indication when parliament would make a decision 
some leaders including landsbergis say the soviet political 
landscape is changing so rapidly that lithuania might do better to 
wait 
on friday the communist party leadership is scheduled to meet 
to make final preparations for the national party congress that 
begins monday in moscow 
gorbachev is likely to face bitter criticism from both 
traditional communists and reformers and may face a challenge to 
his party leadership 
cekuolis the newspaper editor said he believes gorbachev wants 
to enter the party congress saying he has solved the lithuanian 
crisis 
lithuanian legislators acknowledged that their plans partially 
hinged on whether they think gorbachev has the power to withstand 
any challenge to his leadership 
legislator valerijonas sadreika said if the situation in 
russia changes and a more conservative leader emerges it would be 
more complicated to negotiate with russia 
in that case lithuania should act on gorbachevs offer while it 
can cekuolis said

hundreds of farmers seeking guaranteed 
minimum prices for their produce occupied the ministry of 
agriculture on thursday and rejected demands they end the protest 
to clear the way for negotiations 
the 600 farmers blocked employees from entering the ministry 
they marched through central warsaw to the building wednesday and 
occupied it overnight after a delegation reported no results from 
preliminary discussions with cabinet members 
our demands are the same ones weve been presenting to the 
government for half a year said boguslaw wlodarczyk of the 
farmers strike committee farmers will occupy the building until 
it is solved he said 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki said substantial talks 
could begin if the protesters left the building but strike 
committee chairman wladyslaw wrona said that would signal defeat 
we shall let in only those who come to settle our problems 
he said 
he also turned down an invitation to hold talks with the 
solidarity caucus of parliament 
the protesters occupied a conference room and sat in hallways 
farmers at the door tussled with employees who tried to enter 
the farmers seek governmentset minimum prices as a buffer 
against the effects of a government program to create a market 
economy from polands socialized system of the last four decades 
they also want more favorable loan terms and assurances of 
profitability for farming 
polands postcommunist government has repeatedly stated that 
the success of the reforms depends on consistency and that to 
yield to strike pressure will only unleash a torrent of requests 
from other sectors 
the farmers protest is the third serious challenge to the 
government reform drive in the past two months the other two 
involving dairy farmers and railway workers were suspended at 
solidarity leader lech walesas appeal 
the government has appealed for labor peace to give the reforms 
time to work and has taken a firm line against negotiating with 
strikers 
it likens the farmers demands for minimum prices to the 
subsidies the communist regime used to satisfy farmers those 
subsidies kept consumer prices artificially low 
the reform program cut most subsidies lifted price controls 
let interest rates rise to reflect the level of inflation and 
opened the economy to private ventures 
while refusing to set guaranteed prices the government has 
created an agricultural market agency to begin work in july it 
will buy grain as needed to help support price levels the 
government also has indicated a willingness to take limited steps 
to regulate other agricultural sectors including the especially 
hardhit dairy industry 
the farmers accustomed to guaranteed markets in foodshort 
poland have been chided for failing to react to new competitive 
market conditions 
once could discern statements of farmers longing for times 
when farmers didnt have freedom but when they knew how much they 
could sell their products for and when everything they offered was 
being bought the newspaper rzeczpospolita said reporting on the 
agriculture ministry protest 
the growers contend that special conditions of farming 
including the yearlong cycle of sowing harvesting selling and 
planning investment for the next planting require government 
flexibility 
seventyfive percent of polands farmland is privately owned 
but nearly half the farms are small plots whose tillers say they 
have neither the time nor transport to seek markets for their 
products other than the local quasigovernmental cooperatives 
established under the socialist system 
these cooperatives have cut prices paid to farmers because of 
huge inventories created by consumers unwilling to buy at prices 
that have increased up to 1000 percent in the last year

air traffic controllers in the chicago area 
allowed eight close calls between airplanes in a recent 10day 
period the federal aviation administration said 
one of the most serious involved two northwest airlines jets 
both flying at 33000 feet which came within ninetenths of a mile 
of each other according to a preliminary faa investigation 
a second incident involved a flight on which the governor of 
iowa was a passenger the faa said 
were upset about it mark scholl an official of the 
national air traffic controllers association said of the rash of 
incidents that occurred between june 17 and tuesday we dont 
have an explanation for it theres not a common thread 
but scholl said wednesday he believed the eight incidents at the 
chicago air route traffic control center in aurora were an 
aberration 
none of the incidents was classified as a near midair 
collision faa spokesman mort edelstein said 
edelstein said an investigative team was looking at all eight 
incidents he said some changes went into effect wednesday in an 
effort to correct the situation but declined to elaborate 
in all of 1989 controllers made 34 operational errors in 
which planes stray closer than the minimum separation allowed by 
the faa edelstein said so far this year 25 such errors have 
occurred he said 
the northwest airlines incident took place saturday when a dc9 
with 32 passengers came within ninetenths of a mile of another 
northwest jet a boeing 727 with 131 passengers 
the incident involving iowa gov terry branstad occurred june 21 
over indiana when an american airlines 727 came within 200 feet 
vertically and 16 miles horizontally of an iowa national guard 
plane carrying 16 people including branstad 
scholl said a controller trainee apparently issued incorrect 
altitude orders to the american flight 
in six of the incidents a computer alerted controllers to the 
problem in the two others the alert system was not activated 
those two incidents were classified as minor because 80 percent of 
the minimum separation was maintained

president bush on thursday officially asked 
the senate to ratify the agreement he made with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev on underground nuclear weapons tests 
the accord signed by the two countries june 1 during gorbachevs 
visit to washington spells out measures against cheating on 
existing treaties that limit nuclear tests 
the agreement will permit both nations to ratify the 1974 
threshold test ban treaty and the 1976 peaceful nuclear explosion 
treaty which limits us and soviet underground nuclear tests to 
150 kilotons 
the accords recently agreed to by the two countries represent 
the successful culmination of several years of effort to provide 
for effective verification of compliance with the treaties bush 
said in his letter transmitting the treaty protocols to the senate 
changes at the us nuclear test site in nevada that are 
required to meet the agreement were considered carefully and have 
been judged manageable and therefore acceptable in the interests of 
effective verification bush wrote

greater efforts are needed to prevent pregnant 
women from abusing drugs witnesses told a senate panel thursday 
but they differed on how to deal with the problem of drugaddicted 
babies 
we have a public health emergency with crack cocaine said 
sen daniel moynihan dny who presided over a senate finance 
committee hearing on the scope of the drug baby crisis 
two reports released at the hearing said the number of babies 
born to women who abused drugs during pregnancy may be several 
times higher than is reported by hospitals 
estimates that between 100000 and 375000 drugexposed infants 
are born each year may be far too low because many hospitals do not 
screen and test pregnant women for drug use a general accounting 
office study said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said federal 
programs and demonstration projects are making more treatment 
available but he said we need the help of the american people 
anyone who knows a drug or alcoholusing pregnant woman has 
the duty to warn her away from these substances this is 
especially the responsibility of the babys father sullivan said 
he also said he is asking the public health service to educate 
the public about the risks of drug use during pregnancy including 
the greater likelihood that the baby will have medical and 
developmental problems 
sullivan did not say more money was needed in the drug war 
rather he said i firmly believe that the administration is 
meeting these challenges effectively 
but comptroller general charles bowsher said a general 
accounting office study released thursday showed the drug problem 
could decrease with more federal funding 
after visiting hospitals in boston chicago los angeles new 
york and san antonio gao investigators concluded that 
nationwide drug treatment services are insufficient he said 
in his prepared testimony 
he cited a recent survey by the national association of state 
alcohol and drug abuse directors estimating that 280000 pregnant 
women nationwide needed drug treatment but less than 11 percent of 
them received care 
less than 1 percent of the federal antidrug funding is targeted 
specifically at treatment for women and the percentage is even 
less for addicted pregnant women he said 
expanding drug treatment services might reduce the number of 
drugexposed births and alleviate some of the family dysfunction 
that is contributing to the growing number of child abuse and 
neglect cases and foster placements he said 
the cost of services for a baby born with problems because of 
its mothers drug use is estimated to be about 750000 for the 
first 18 years of life he said 
sen tom daschle dsd said more emphasis is needed on 
preventing drug and alcohol abuse but he added skeptically when 
all is said and done theres always a lot more said than done

federal agencies 
the twoinchthick compendium put together by the public 
citizen health research group lists actions taken against 
physicians and other medical professionals in 40 states and the 
district of columbia 
if your doctor is among the 6892 on this list you ought at 
least to question the quality of his or her care said dr sidney 
wolfe director of the public citizen health research group at 
the very minimum you should find out why the doctor is on the 
list 
the nations system for protecting the public from incompetent 
physicians has vastly improved in the last 15 years but 
remains inadequate said the group founded by consumer activist 
ralph nader 
gaps the size of the grand canyon may have shrunk to texas 
arroyos desert stream beds but they still snake everywhere 
across the landscape the groups report said 
and those dangerous doctors who fall through the cracks 
continue to kill maim defraud and otherwise injure their 
unknowing patients 
the guide contains the names of physicians dentists 
chiropractors and podiatrists who have been disciplined by state 
medical boards medicare or the federal drug enforcement 
administration 
also each states section lists doctors who have addresses in 
that state but were disciplined by medical boards in other states 
it also contains the reason for the action where available 
public citizen said its compendium is the first such nationwide 
roster available to the public 
the federal government is preparing to open a national 
practitioner data bank which will have information on state 
disciplinary actions malpractice payments and revocation of 
hospital privileges

actions that went back even further while others provided data for 
only the last year or two 
still others didnt provide any information at all 
state medical boards in alabama alaska colorado oklahoma and

a jury tuesday began deliberating whether former 
philippines first lady imelda marcos looted her country of 222 
million and secretly invested the money with the help of saudi 
financier adnan khashoggi 
the panel was given the case after hearing instructions from 
us district judge john f keenan 
keenan dismissed the five alternate jurors and requested they 
not discuss the case with reporters until after a verdict 
as the jury left the courtroom to begin deliberations family 
members and supporters embraced mrs marcos 
mrs marcos who turns 61 monday told a reporter pray for me 
a happy birthday 
she faces up to 50 years in prison and a 1 million fine if 
convicted of racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and 
obstructing justice 
the jurors also are considering mail fraud and obstruction of 
justice charges against khashoggi 54 
the judge told the jury to consider how much mrs marcos knew of 
the alleged crimes but he added that she can be found guilty if 
she closed her eyes to whether stolen money was used for 
investments in the united states 
mrs marcos knowledge was a central theme in closing arguments 
earlier in the week 
assistant us attorney charles labella said the widow of ousted 
phillipines president ferdinand marcos had to know dirty money 
was used to buy four new york buildings jewelry and art work 
her attorney gerry spence denied she was aware of the 
transactions and said the case was a prosecutors fantasy 
keenan said the jury must consider whether mrs marcos knew the 
money was taken by fraud or whether she deliberately closed her 
eyes 
he said the jurors can convict only if they find the defendants 
guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt he said direct and 
circumstantial evidence are given the same weight 
in addressing the racketeering charges the judge said the 
government did not have to prove that mrs marcos herself committed 
the fraud 
a person who aids or abets the commission of an offense is 
just as guilty of that offense as if he or she committed it himself 
or herself he said of course the mere presence of a 
defendant where a crime is being committed even coupled with 
knowledge that a crime is occurring is not sufficient to 
establish aiding and abetting 
mrs marcos is alleged to have helped her husband embezzle 222 
million from their countrys treasury using the money for secret 
investments and spending sprees 
khashoggi allegedly served as a front for the marcoses to 
conceal ownership of the four new york buildings and art works 
after they were ousted from power in february 1986 and the new 
government sued to recover their riches he could draw a 10year 
prison term and 500000 in fines if convicted

thieves smashed a museum window 
thursday and made off with three van gogh paintings after the 
museums alarm system described as failsafe did not go off 
the noordbrabants museum lost the prize paintings of its 
collection to thieves who jumped several fences and broke the 
groundfloor window of the gallery where the paintings were 
hanging officials said 
stolen were the sitting farmers wife the digging 
farmers wife and wheels of the water mill in gennep the 
museums deputy director peter veenland said their total value 
was 27 million to 54 million 
he said the paintings were insured but refused to say for how 
much 
vincent van gogh painted them while living in what is now the 
town of nuenen 18 miles from the museum 
it was the third time in two years that paintings by the dutch 
impressionist had been stolen from museums in the netherlands 
the noordbrabants museum has what veenland called a 
stateoftheart updated alarm system it has two elements 
designed to detect intruders seismic sensors measure movement and 
infrared sensors to measure body heat 
the security system was turned on and being monitored by a 
security firm but both sets of sensors in the van gogh gallery 
were found to be inoperative veenland told the associated press in 
an interview 
the system should have showed up that the sensors were not 
working veenland said but it didnt happen and it is a 
mystery to us why 
veenland refused to speculate on whether the alarms were 
intentionally disabled or on the possible involvement of museum 
staff police were questioning staff members 
neighbors heard the sound of breaking glass at about 1230 am 
and called police 
veenland said the thieves who police believe numbered three 
had to tear the framed paintings off anchors in the wall 
it was the first theft from the museum which moved about two 
years ago to its current home a converted granite mansion in this 
provincial capital 53 miles south of amsterdam 
the museum has about 300 works 
the 25by327 inch water mill was painted in 1884 the 
15by1125 inch sitting farmers wife and the 
156by107inch digging farmers wife were done in 1885 
van gogh painted them during his socalled brabant period when 
he used as his models the poor peasantry of the brabant which 
encompasses a large part of the southern netherlands 
guy jennings an impressionism expert at christies auction 
house in london called the stolen paintings minor works 
compared to van goghs later output but both he and veenland said 
it would be impossible to sell them on the open market 
van goghs brabant period works are generally dark in tone and 
employ none of the bright impressionist colors such as those used 
in irises which have brought record auction prices 
the most significant of the dutch impressionists works are in 
amsterdams van gogh museum and the kroellermueller museum near 
the eastern dutch town of otterloo 
in december 1988 three van goghs including one version of his 
famous depiction of rural poverty the potato eaters were 
stolen from the kroellermueller 
in may of 1988 three other works by modern masters including 
van goghs carnations were taken from amsterdams municipal 
museum 
all were recovered

president bush probably will ask nato allies 
to declare formally next week that they do not pose a threat to 
nations of the warsaw pact secretary of state james a baker said 
thursday 
the declaration would be intended to calm moscows anxieties 
about a united germany being a military and political member of 
nato 
baker said it would be premature now for the united states to 
give cash aid to the soviet union to help its sickly economy 
instead he suggested that the major industrialized nations at 
an economic summit in houston next month consider guidelines for 
financial assistance for moscow 
western european leaders on wednesday agreed in principle to aid 
moscow but have not considered specific proposals or amounts and 
some analysts have suggested trading such aid for soviet military 
cutbacks germany already is guaranteeing loans to the soviet union 
baker spoke at a white house briefing to set the stage for a 
16nation nato summit in london next week and the sevennation 
economic gathering in houston the following week 
at his briefing baker said nato should stick with its 
decadesold policy of threatening to fire nuclear weapons first in 
response to a major soviet attack with conventional weapons 
though this socalled flexible response strategy may be 
discussed i would suspect that there wont be any change 
baker said i dont think we ought to make europe safe for 
conventional war 
the idea of a nonaggression statement was raised by bush in an 
interview with foreign journalists on wednesday 
its appropriate to at least give some consideration to this 
idea that there could be some sort of a declaration of 
nonaggression defensive intent peaceful intent baker said 
he said any such statement probably would be directed at the 
member states of the warsaw pact rather than the sovietled 
alliance itself 
baker said the united states is not trying to restrain other 
nations from coming to the soviets aid but feels moscow must 
reform its statecontrolled economy before the money can be spent 
in a meaningful way 
ive been to 10 of these economic summits the last 10 and 
ive never been to one yet where theres been total agreement on 
every issue baker added 
bush departs friday for a long holiday weekend at his vacation 
home in kennebunkport maine before flying to london on july 4 
with the two summits he will be away from washington until the 
early morning hours of july 12 
the pentagon announced that defense secretary dick cheney is 
delaying a visit to several nato nations to confer with bush in 
maine before the london meetings 
cheney had been scheduled to leave saturday for a twoweek nato 
tour but has put off his departure until monday evening so he can 
meet with bush earlier in the day at the presidents summer home in 
kennebunkport 
the two men are expected to discuss among other things the 
eastwest conventional force reduction talks in vienna and the 
alliances response to the revolutionary changes that have swept 
the soviet bloc 
the defense secretary is slated to visit nations on the flanks 
of the alliance including norway greece turkey portugal and 
spain 
the secretary has already visited the principal nato allies in 
the central region and he believed it was very important to give 
equal attention to our very important allies in the southern and 
northern region a senior defense official said 
the official speaking on condition he not be identified said 
the soviet posture on the flanks and those borders is still quite 
significant 
while in greece cheney plans to sign a new defense agreement 
that allows us bases to remain there for the next eight years 
the official said 
the united states has four bases and about 20 smaller units in 
greece but is closing two of them in part of a worldwide 
costcutting drive

treasury secretary nicholas f brady saying 
the federal government will run out of money and borrowing 
authority late this summer asked congress on thursday to raise the 
debt limit before its august recess 
the current ceiling is 312 trillion the nations debt stood 
at 305 trillion on thursday after topping the 3 trillion mark 
for the first time in april 
based on our current estimate it appears likely that without 
an increase in the debt limit the treasury will run out of cash 
and borrowing authority and default on the governments obligations 
in midaugust brady said in a letter to rep bill frenzel 
rminn 
but brady added that a significant increase in spending on the 
savings and loan bailout could require a debtlimit increase 
earlier that month 
in any case it is highly likely that default would occur 
before congress returns in september the secretary said 
his letter to the ranking republican on the house budget 
committee did not include a dollar amount saying that would follow 
as soon as the midyear review of the budget is available next month 
from the office of management and budget 
at that time we will also advise you of our best estimate of 
the date that default would occur absent action to increase the 
debt limit brady wrote 
the government narrowly averted its first default last november 
when congress raised the debt limit from 28 trillion for the 
fiscal year ending sept 30 
although the government has never defaulted it has come close 
on several other occasions 
for example it had to dip into social security funds to keep 
its line of credit open in 1985 and in 1983 a delay in increasing 
the debt limit forced the government to exhaust its line of credit 
leading to a suspension of savings bond sales restrictions on 
deposits to the social security funds and cancellation of scheduled 
securities auctions 
the national debt has more than tripled since the beginning of 
the decade as the treasury was forced to borrow more and more money 
to finance government spending that exceeds tax receipts 
the annual deficits have gone down from their peak of over 200 
billion a year but the deficit still totaled 1521 billion in the 
year ending last sept 30 it totaled 15168 billion after the 
first eight months of the current fiscal year and some analysts say 
it could return to the 200 billion level again by years end

thousands gathered outside the miami 
beach convention center where nelson mandela spoke thursday some 
hoped for a glimpse of their hero others protested his support for 
cubas fidel castro 
blacks and hispanics have long been at odds in the miami area 
tensions rose to a fever pitch late last year during the trial of a 
hispanic policeman whose shooting of a black motorcyclist triggered 
three days of rioting in miami during january 1989 
the mandela visit with its political rhetoric and rejection of 
the antiapartheid leader by several cubanamerican mayors in south 
florida inflamed those tensions once again 
metal barricades and police in riot gear and on horseback kept 
the mostly black promandela crowd away from several hundred cuban 
exiles who burned a soviet flag and shouted down with mandela 
police broke up several scuffles between the factions and 
quickly ushered away two selfdescribed rednecks carrying signs 
saying fight communism support the afrikaner resistance movement 
there were no arrests police said 
while cubans denounced the 71yearold mandela for his ties to 
castro blacks harshly criticized the protests chanting free 
south florida they promised to retaliate on election day against 
miami mayor xavier suarez and other cubanborn politicians who 
denounced mandela and stayed away during his visit 
im very embarrassed i feel this is one of the bleakest 
moments miami has experienced said willie haywood a 34yearold 
postal worker 
they had tickertape parades for him in new york and hundreds 
of thousands saw him speak in boston haywood said now we have 
the distinction of being the most racist city in america 
at a rally across biscayne bay in miamis predominantly black 
liberty city former federal judge alcee hastings a longtime black 
leader lamented mandelas treatment 
its shameful we didnt do better said hastings were 
the only city that didnt provide this worldclass leader with a 
grand welcome 
thursdays gathering of exiles in miami beach was the first 
largescale protest on mandelas us tour south florida which 
has seen three innercity riots in the 1980s is the only area 
where politicians have not clamored to share mandelas spotlight 
they should be here with the keys to the city said joe 
cook 40 with long dredlocks and an african medallion on his 
chest anybody who turns his back on him is a little bitty man 
while waiting for mandela supporters outside the convention 
center sang the african national congress anthem and musicians in 
traditional african costumes pounded a steady drumbeat hundreds of 
people sprinted around the block in hopes of catching a bit of 
history when he finally pulled into a side entrance 
i saw him i saw mandela shouted rovan locke the publisher 
of miamibased caribbean commentary magazine such a great human 
being in my midst its the greatest feeling in my life 
mandela left for detroit immediately after his speech to the 
american federation of state county and municipal employees union 
bypassing an invitation to address the impromptu rally in miamis 
liberty city the scene in 1980 of one of the nations worst race 
riots 
cuban exiles said they would have no praise for mandela until he 
disassociates himself from castro on national tv last week 
mandela praised the cuban president for his help in the years when 
the west refused to support his antiapartheid struggle 
mandela is a traitor said ricardo acabader 67 who wore a 
cuban flag over his shoulders 
were not singling out mandelas cause we are opposed to 
anyone who does not oppose castro added rafael cabezas a 
veteran of the failed bay of pigs invasion 
mandela has also cited palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat and libyan leader moammar gadhafi for their help 
jewish leaders said the comments were troubling but only a few 
jewish protesters joined the demonstration against mandela

alive from the rubble of his home nearly a week after his familys 
residence was flattened by an earthquake the official news media 
said thursday

late wednesday next to the bodies of family members in the ruins of 
rahmatabad 125 miles northwest of tehran he was freed 162 hours 
after the quake irna said

for treatment the agency said it provided no further details

the red crescent irans equivalent of the red cross say they 
counted 40000 dead and 60000 injured government officials say 
50000 iranians died 200000 were injured and 500000 were left 
homeless 
the earthquake centered near the caspian sea about 125 miles 
northwest of tehran destroyed 1755 schools and caused an 
estimated 625 million in damage irna said 
also thursday irans ambassador to the united nations thanked 
the 86 nations that contributed aid and issued an appeal for 
international assistance to rebuild the devastated regions 
there is an urgent and continued need for international 
cooperation not only to alleviate present suffering but also to 
make the areas as safe as possible in the future kamal kharrazi 
told the general assembly 
to date kharrazi said 171 planeloads of supplies have reached 
the iranian capital of tehran in addition about 100 teams have 
been set up to fight disease and to disinfect disaster areas he 
said 
fifteen aftershocks wednesday and thursday jolted the 
northwestern provinces of gilan and zanjan which bore the brunt of 
the june 21 earthquake the agency said 
reporting from the devastated township of rudbar the agency 
said one grieving woman who lost her husband and five children in 
the quake was refusing to eat 
how can i eat while i myself wrapped the bodies of my beloved 
children in shrouds and buried them it quoted the woman goncheh 
ibrahimi as saying 
the june 21 quake which registered 73 to 77 on the richter 
scale according to western and iranian accounts is the deadliest 
since an estimated 200000 people died in a 1978 earthquake in 
china 
there have been more than 400 aftershocks in the iranian fault 
zone the last week the geophysics center at tehran university said 
the strongest aftershock measured 48 
but irna quoted an unidentified senior official at the tehran 
center as saying the tectonic fault that caused the deadly quake 
was gradually stabilizing 
that was welcome news for the thousands of iranian and foreign 
rescue workers who have been clawing through the rubble of 342 
flattened towns and villages in the rugged region 
the aftershocks have blocked roads halting truck convoys 
carrying tents blankets medicine and food into the stricken 
provinces 
irna said one of the latest tremors caused landslides that 
blocked a key road between rasht on the caspian sea and rudbar to 
the southwest for the second time in a week 
relief officials said that with hope running out of finding 
survivors trapped in the rubble the relief operation is 
concentrating more on taking care of the living 
irna said mohammad hassan eftekhari a member of the 270seat 
majlis or parliament who died in wednesdays crash of a relief 
helicopter was given a heros burial in his hometown of fouman in 
northern iran 
four of the other 14 relief workers aboard the usbuilt 
chinook transport were critically injured when it crashed in bad 
weather in the mountainous kelishom region in the southern sector 
of the quake zone

defense secretary dick cheney has decided 
there will be fewer stars in the pentagons firmament and will cut 
78 general and admirals over the next four years it was announced 
thursday 
gen colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
had recommended that the slots be eliminated pentagon spokesman 
pete williams said 
currently there are 1073 such positions in the military 407 
generals in the army 338 in the air force 70 in the marine corps 
and 258 flag officers in the navy 
the cut will bring the new level to 995 such slots by 1995 
at the end of april there were 2 million men and women on 
active duty in the nations armed forces 
the move is part of the pentagons effort to cut back its forces 
amid the drive to save money and adjust to lessened eastwest 
tensions williams said 
the reduction amounts to about a 7 percent cut in the number of 
general and flag officer positions a far cry from the much larger 
cuts in store for some of the services army officials have 
predicted that they may be cutting one soldier in four from the 
ranks over the next five years 
powell in a statement released at the pentagon said his 
proposal had the backing of the service chiefs 
the joint chiefs and i believe this plan reflects an 
appropriate balance between continuing requirements and changing 
force structure powell said in light of anticipated force 
structure changes we recognize the necessity for general and flag 
officer requirements and inventory to drop below current levels 
williams said cheney and powell wanted to emphasize that it was 
appropriate to begin force level reductions at the top and 
among all the services 
the cut means the elimination of 33 generals from the army 27 
from the air force three from the marine corps and 15 flag 
officers from the navy 
a total of 20 positions will be eliminated before the end of 
1991 an additional 20 in each of the next two years and 18 in 
1994 williams said 
the spokesman said that an attempt would be made to reduce the 
numbers through retirement and attrition but that additional steps 
may have to be taken to make the cuts 
i dont think retirement and attrition are going to do it 
he said 
williams said that the exact job positions have not yet been 
designated for elimination and that such decisions will be left to 
the various services

the bush administration is taking a close look 
at a letter from israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir on mideast 
negotiations and may set up a meeting between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and the new israeli foreign minister david levy 
sources said shamir reaffirmed his commitment to his own 
proposal for elections among palestinian arabs on the west bank and 
gaza and his interest in baker resuming his effort to implement the 
plan 
the sources declining to be identified said the prime minister 
did not specifically exclude palestinians deported from the 
territories from the negotiations 
shamir sent the letter in response to one from president bush 
inquiring about the prime ministers intentions now that he has 
formed a new government the last israeli government headed by 
shamir collapsed in march in disagreement over whether to approve 
bakers formula for israelipalestinian talks 
a key stumbling block was a provision to include palestinians 
deported by the israelis from the west bank or others who had homes 
in east jerusalem 
even before shamir replied american and israeli diplomats 
discussed having baker meet levy the new foreign minister its 
a foregone conclusion they will meet eventually a us official 
said 
but plans have not jelled levy has been hospitalized with a 
heart condition complicating the situation 
a meeting is one option under consideration the idea being to 
discuss the letter a second us official said 
the sources said shamir reaffirmed his intention to open the 
elections to all residents of the west bank and gaza he spoke in 
general terms thereby not excluding deported palestinians the 
sources said 
baker declined to discuss the letter at a news conference at the 
white house the main topic of the session was the nato summit 
meeting to be held next week in london 
we need more time to study the letter baker said 
he implied there were positive and negative aspects to what 
shamir wrote to bush there are elements on both sides of the 
equation baker said ambiguously 
but he repeated i dont want to make judgments until we have 
more time to look at the letter 
shamirs plan is to have elected palestinians negotiate limited 
selfrule with israel after five years there would be wider 
negotiations to arrange a lasting settlement

a top state department official said thursday 
that the united states has no intention of sending military troops 
to fight the drug war in peru 
that scenario is the farthest thing from our mind said 
melvyn levitsky assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics 
levitsky also told members of the senate foreign relations 
committee he is optimistic us officials can reach an agreement 
with peruvian presidentelect alberto fujimori about a strategy to 
reduce the production of coca while encouraging economic 
development 
the us plan calls for sending military equipment and 
trainers to help perus law enforcement agencies fight drugs 
fujimori said during his campaign that he would reject any 
foreign intervention in the war against drugs 
but levitsky said there may have been a misunderstanding on the 
part of fujimori about what the united states wants to do 
officials at the us embassy in lima have not discussed the 
situation with fujimori levitsky said 
sen chris dodd dconn said there was apparently confusion 
about the new governments position on us participation in 
perus war on drugs i am wary about the administrations 
plans he said 
fujimori who must contend with a decadelong war with leftist 
shining path guerrillas as well as with cocaine traffickers said 
he favors economic support to military force in eradicating coca 
plantations 
last week william j bennett the administrations drug policy 
coordinator said he hopes to complete a formal agreement soon with 
peru so the united states can start providing military equipment

manuel noriegas prosecutors acknowledged thursday 
they have not given secret panamanian files to the defense but 
blamed the failure on the enormous volume of documents not 
interference by intelligence agencies 
michael okane an attorney for noriega codefendant daniel 
miranda had charged that a secret inventory discovered by one 
of his investigators showed about 40 file cabinets seized during 
the us invasion were missing from a us military warehouse in 
panama 
federal magistrate william turnoff held a hearing thursday on 
the issue and prosecutors while not disputing the inventorys 
authenticity played down its importance 
there are far more documents than we have actually placed in 
the warehouse assistant us attorney michael sullivan said 
we have just yards and yards of documents 
but he added that he could not say why the documents were not 
made available to defense investigators in the corozal warehouse in 
panama 
we asked our people in corozal for a reason and havent 
received one yet he said 
sullivan promised to turn over any relevant files once they were 
examined but said that could take up until the morning of the 
trial which is set for jan 28 
following the governments assurances okane withdrew his 
motion accusing prosecutors of violating turnoffs order to hand 
over appropriate documents 
but he said the us attorneys office had still not addressed 
the question of whether documents were removed by us intelligence 
agencies 
i think all you can say is they dont know either okane 
said after the hearing 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
later that prosecutors have no indication so far that any files are 
missing 
okane noted that panamanian officials investigating corruption 
under noriega also have been denied access to the files 
he said the list he found shows that during the december 
invasion the army confiscated file cabinets containing panamanian 
intelligence files weapons importexport records confidential 
correspondence and files on noriega foes who plotted a coup 
the list is far more extensive than an inventory turned over to 
the defense by the us attorneys office 
the new york times and the washington post have reported 
quoting unidentified sources that army intelligence officials have 
complained they fear the cia sanitized the captured files the 
cia has denied the charges 
attorneys for the ousted panamanian dictator have insisted that 
many of his activities were sanctioned by the united states they 
have said that us and panamanian intelligence records would show 
he cooperated with the cia and the drug enforcement administration 
the disputed records are in the custody of the us southern 
commands 470th military intelligence group at a warehouse in 
corozal okane said he sent a private investigator to the 
warehouse to rummage through boxes of documents listed by the 
government 
the investigator found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage 
what okane believes is the real inventory the attorney said 
okanes client miranda is out on bond on charges of helping 
to fly drug money from fort lauderdale to panama if convicted he 
could be sentenced to five years in prison 
noriega confined at the metropolitan correctional center 
outside of miami faces up to 145 years in prison if convicted of 
accepting 46 million in bribes from colombias medellin drug 
cartel to turn panama into a safe haven for usbound drugs

the air force will rely on hot soapy water to 
rid its military equipment of the remnants of chemical warfare 
while the navy plans to use a bleaching agent 
but the army and marine corps have for years been using a 
decontaminating chemical called ds2 that six years ago ate through 
an electronic cable on an m1 tank 
the selection has concerned lawmakers and prompted congressional 
investigators to urge defense secretary dick cheney to direct the 
army and marine corps to chose a safer cheaper alternative 
it could be literally another agent orange sitting out 
there rep mike synar dokla chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on environment energy and natural 
resources told army officials 
the criticism came as representatives from the general 
accounting office the investigative arm of congress detailed 
serious problems with ds2 ranging from leaking containers that 
were improperly stored to sales to private individuals who were 
never informed of the hazards 
in defense of their selection army officials said that unlike 
the navy and air force the services troops live in the field and 
must take their equipment with them 
this requires the availability of a decontaminant which can 
effectively be used in an efficient and immediate manner in 
locations where water may be severely limited in availability 
said brig gen david a nydam commanding general of the us 
chemical research development and engineering center 
the military services have purchased about 5 million gallons of 
ds2 since the early 1960s with the army requiring the largest 
amount 666000 gallons at a cost of nearly 18 million 
the chemical solution is manufactured by dalden corp of 
roanoke texas and poly research of holtsville ny 
the gao found that ds2 is toxic and highly corrosive and can 
cause severe burns liver damage and reproductive or birth defects 
based on the problems the air force and navy have opted for less 
toxic alternatives 
the gao found that at five of the us facilities the ds2 was 
improperly stored and in some cases the cans were leaking 
at fort sill okla the chemical was stored with supertropical 
bleach a combination the gao said could set off an explosion 
meanwhile at fort lewis wash cans of ds2 were stored in a shed 
without walls exposing the material to the elements 
nydam said the army was aware of the problem and was correcting 
the mistakes at the storage facilities 
the gao also found that the defense logistics agency sold cans 
of the chemical to private citizens but failed to provide them with 
material safety data sheets which identify the health and 
environmental hazards associated with ds2

arbitrary time limits for rape victims to 
report the crime would throw another obstacle in the path of 
victims already reluctant to push the issue in court witnesses 
told a house panel on thursday 
i think we know it is a fact that many victims dont report 
rapes for days months even years said b joyce dale president 
of the national network for victims of sexual assault in arlington 
va i dont think you can possibly set an arbitrary time limit on 
victims 
testimony before the house select committee on children youth 
and families centered on a continuing congressional debate over 
whether arbitrary reporting deadlines perhaps 24 48 or 72 hours 
ought to be imposed on people intending to seek help under 
federal and state victim compensation laws 
some congressional proponents of time limits believe such 
measures filter out those who might lie about being raped to 
receive funds for abortions but rape victim advocacy spokesmen 
said they believed the reporting and prosecuting procedures victims 
have to face prevent women from crying rape untruthfully 
in recent months congress has debated adding new hurdles to 
the legal obstacle course that must be traversed by victims of rape 
before they can get the help they need said rep george miller 
chairman of the house panel 
witnesses said the trauma of rape prevents many victims from 
reporting an attack immediately after it occurs 
martha zehner who was raped by a coworker described why she 
didnt report the attack 
one reason was that i was too scared and i was too much in 
shock she said i couldnt believe this had happened to me i 
wanted to make believe it hadnt happened 
years later when i had created enough emotional distance from 
this experience i could begin to understand what happened to me 
how frightened i was and really how ill equipped i was to deal with 
it zehner said 
according to government estimates nine out of 10 rapes arent 
reported to authorities based on police reports every hour 16 
rapes are attempted and 10 actually occur 
experts report that an estimated 60 to 80 percent of rapes are 
committed by someone the victims know

prime minister margaret thatcher on thursday told 
the house of commons that britain was continuing to use every 
contact and follow up every lead to help free british hostages in 
lebanon 
but she gave no indication of any progress she also avoided 
criticizing iran which is believed to have influence over moslem 
fundamentalist groups holding captives 
any nation which has any information about anyone who is held 
hostage should do all in its power to secure the release of the 
hostages that is the only normal civilized behavior she said 
answering lawmakers questions mrs thatcher said it was not 
yet right to resume diplomatic relations with syria britain 
broke relations in 1985 charging syria with complicity in a foiled 
plot to blow up an israeli airliner over london 
iran severed relations with britain in march last year after 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on moslems to kill salman 
rushdie british author of the satanic verses which many 
moslems say blasphemes islam 
there are five britons among the 16 hostages missing in lebanon

corn farmers have planted 746 million acres 
for 1990 production up 3 percent from last years 723 million 
acres the agriculture department said thursday 
the new plantings figures were down only fractionally from 748 
million acres of corn indicated in a march survey of farmers 
despite delays in some areas because of wet weather 
soybean plantings were estimated at 58 million acres down 4 
percent from 1989 the report said and that was down from the 594 
million acres of beans farmers had indicated in the march survey 
cotton plantings at 124 million acres are up 17 percent from 
last year and the same as indicated in march 
the 1990 tobacco crop is being planted on 725000 acres up 7 
percent from 1989 but down from the 731000 acres indicated by the 
march survey 
total wheat plantings were shown at 773 million acres up 1 
percent from 1989 the march survey showed total wheat at 776 
million acres 
the report did not include 1990 production forecasts new wheat 
figures will be issued by usda on july 12 and estimates for corn 
and other springplanted crops on aug 9 
meanwhile a related report showed the nations corn inventory 
as of june 1 was an estimated 284 billion bushels down 17 percent 
from a year earlier of the total 162 billion bushels were stored 
on farms 
the use of corn in march april and may was estimated at 197 
billion bushels up 11 percent from disappearance in the second 
quarter of 1989 the report said 
stocks of oldcrop wheat on june 1 the beginning of the new 
wheat marketing year were reported at 535 million bushels down 24 
percent from a year ago and the smallest carryover since 1975 even 
so that was much larger than the 452 million bushels estimated 
previously 
the soybean stockpile at 596 million bushels on june 1 was up 28 
percent from a year earlier

american telephone and telegraph co said 
thursday it will reduce its evening interstate longdistance rates 
by about 5 percent and daytime rates by about a halfpercent sunday 
as part of a 300 million overall price cut 
the company also will reduce the prices of operatorassisted 
calls calls to canada and its reach out america longdistance 
calling plan 
overall if the federal communications commission approves 
interstate calling rates will fall an average 22 percent atampt 
spokesman herb linnen said 
the company said it would eliminate the one free call now 
allowed to interstate directory service meaning all such calls 
will cost 60 cents each 
the cost of a 10minute directdialed evening call anywhere in 
the country will drop to 149 from 158 or less from 5 pm to 
11 pm sunday through friday 
atampts prices have dropped nearly 43 percent since the demise in 
1984 of the old bell system primarily because of fccordered 
reductions in local access charges 
the fcc last week ordered the nations local telephone companies 
to reduce by 11 billion effective sunday what they charge 
longdistance companies to connect with local phone networks 
longdistance carriers typically pass along to their customers 
savings from these reduced access charges 
other longdistance companies such as mci and us sprint 
usually follow atampts lead in rate reductions 
atampt the nations largest longdistance company had announced 
last month that it would cut its rates by 160 million annually 
based on earlier requests that local phone companies had made with 
the fcc 
local companies in april had asked to reduce their access 
charges by 405 million on july 1 but the fcc last week increased 
that amount to the 11 billion figure 
before july 1989 when atampts earnings were restricted to about 
a 12 percent rate of return on its investments the company passed 
on to its customers nearly all the savings whenever local phone 
companies reduced their access charges 
but atampt now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its 
prices within a prescribed range of caps tied to the rate of 
inflation not its profits last november atampt raised prices for 
night and weekend calling by 13 percent 
atampts residential and small business prices currently are at 
the cap so this weekends reductions were necessitated linnen 
said 
large business prices are well below the caps he added 
atampt said it will cut prices for 
directdialed interstate calls between 5 pm and 11 pm 
sunday through friday by an average of 5 percent 
daytime 8 am to 5 pm directdialed calls by an average of 
05 percent 
the reach out america evening discount plan from 815 to 780 
per hour a month and the reach out halfhour plan to 4 from 435 
perminute operatorassisted calls an average of 3 percent 
the first minute of canadian calls at all times

the shadowy blurred image of mayor marion 
barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room is the latest in a 
series of bgrade tapes produced by law enforcement agencies 
the fuzzy gray and grainy pictures of accused criminals acting 
out the drama of a case behind numbers that tick off the date 
hours minutes and seconds are not usually of high cinematic 
quality 
even the owner of a home video camera can generally produce a 
better picture 
but the fbi which recorded barrys arrest in a downtown hotel 
last january and other police agencies operate at a distinct 
technical disadvantage when they set up a concealed camera 
the lens on a concealed camera must be very small 
its not the kind you have on your home video camera a nice 
big large one that would be big and clear and treat light very 
well said one federal law enforcement official 
the quality of the picture also depends on the lighting and 
how much time they have to set it up said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
during the abscam bribery investigation of the late 1970s the 
fbi concealed its cameras inside a television said a former law 
enforcement official 
since then camera technology has improved but concealment is 
still the biggest obstacle to a highquality picture

participating in illegal activities the radio said 
liu was earlier reported arrested during a crackdown late last 
year on clergymen loyal to the pope 
china broke diplomatic relations with the vatican in 1957 and 
allows worship only under the guise of the statesponsored chinese 
patriotic catholic church which consecrates its own bishops 
the church claims more than 3 million members but an unknown 
number of catholics remain secretely loyal to the pope 
liu participated in a meeting last november that the vatican 
radio described as the first gathering in decades of bishops loyal

as a special assignment for the associated 
press defending nascar national association of stock car auto 
racing winston cup racing champion rusty wallace reviews days of 
thunder starring tom cruise and robert duvall the movie opened 
nationally wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
days of thunder is the best racing movie ive ever seen 
its realistic because actual nascar race cars were used in the 
production and the film relied heavily on real participants for 
truetolife impact much of the racing action came from actual 
nascar races the results are tremendous 
robert duvalls performance was exceptional many of the 
characters in the movie triggered almost instant reallife 
parallels to people currently involved in the sport 
the plot should be of interest to both racing enthusiasts and 
nonrace fans alike theres action humor action romance and 
more action 
the intense personal competitiveness found in our racing was 
realistically portrayed the competitive spirit off the racetrack 
and the importance of sponsors to the sport was accurate 
one of the most impressive aspects of the movie was its 
realistic portrayal of the camaraderie we have in the sport arch 
rivals cole trickle cruise and rowdy burns michael rooker help 
each other during a crisis its a genuine relationship we have in 
racing we may strap on our helmets week after week and go at it 
against one another but we come to each others aid in a real time 
of need 
theres a multicar crash scene in the movie which really struck 
home cole comes wide open through the smoke and gets caught up in 
the crash i faced a similar situation last year in a race at 
pennsylvania international raceway i crashed big time too but 
luckily i didnt get hurt 
days of thunder shows the fear and apprehension racers face 
its something with which you live rarely ever discuss and try to 
keep in the right perspective 
people involved with racing on a daily basis will probably feel 
theres a bit too much dramatization in days of thunder because 
of all the crashing we do rub sheet metal a lot but not as 
much as is depicted in the movie 
and the heat of the battle seems to always focus on only two 
cars but i guess that is the basis for classic competition 
as for the added drama my feelings toward days of thunder 
parallel what a real fighter pilot might think about the level of 
drama in top gun things tend to be just a little bit different 
when you get a birds eye view 
still i cant wait to go back to see days of thunder again 
this time with my family the next time around ill probably sit 
in the back row and really soak it in ill probably look at it a 
bit more critically and with more scrutiny next time

engineers who spent years designing and 
manufacturing the mirrors now blamed for blurring the hubble space 
telescopes view of the universe scrambled thursday to figure out 
what went wrong 
a team of about 40 people at hughes danbury optical systems inc 
was gathering every document on the hubble dating back to 1977 
when the company was awarded a 450 million contract to build the 
telescopes precision optics 
my understanding is that they will review all the documents 
related to the entire procedure said thomas arconti spokesman 
for hughes 
hughes made the two mirrors that were called the heart of the 
hubble and which were cited wednesday as the cause of a focusing 
problem which has made the space telescope no more powerful than 
one on the ground 
national aeronautics and space administration officials in 
washington said the flaw cannot be repaired from the ground 
engineers will install a correcting lens in a replacement camera 
scheduled to be placed aboard hubble by space shuttle astronauts in 
1993 but the observatory never will be able to capture all the 
spectacular views of the universe that had been expected officials 
said 
scientists are working on ways to salvage some research from the 
15 billion observatory and a nasa team is being organized to 
investigate the problem 
jack rehnberg chief of hughes space science office said 
wednesday his company was prepared to cooperate fully with the nasa 
investigation he said it appeared that something inherently 
fundamentally was not done right 
arconti insisted thursday that all work related to the hubble 
was tested and retested checked and rechecked with nasa 
scientists he said no one could pinpoint the problem until all the 
documents had been examined 
all of our test results met specifications so thats where 
the mystery lies he said he said a team of nasa engineers was 
expected to arrive in danbury soon 
in the main lobby of hughes headquarters business appeared 
normal employees met with clients and even joked occasionally 
about the hubble problem one employee who refused to give his 
name but said he had not worked on the hubble project said company 
morale was holding up real well 
arconti the only hughes employee available to comment said 
news of the mirror problem naturally was surprising and 
disappointing for those who had worked on the telescope 
the hubble space telescope was supposed to be able to see into 
the outer reaches of space at distances up to 14 billion 
lightyears or 84 billion trillion miles 
nasa hubble scientist ed weiler said at a news conference 
thursday that a minute error in the curve of one of the two mirrors 
is causing the reflected light of the stars to miss a precise point 
of focus by only 4 percent of the diameter of a human hair just 
enough to spoil the extremely sharp photos astronomers expected 
aside from the mirrors and the other precision hardware hughes 
also supplied the telescopes fineguidance sensors which work 
like an ultraprecise sextant to allow the telescope to literally 
steer by the stars 
nearly 2000 employees have worked on the development of the 
telescopes optics since 1973 four years before hughes then a 
division of the perkinelmer corp received the contract 
perkinelmer sold its optics division to hughes aircraft co of 
california last year

president bushs call for a tax increase is 
reigniting the partisan richvspoor battle that ripped through 
congress last year over the presidents demand for a cut in the 
capital gains tax 
house speaker thomas foley denied thursday that democratic 
leaders implicitly agreed that bush will win a cut in the capital 
gains tax in the budget summit in exchange for abandonment of his 
nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
we are all interested in reaching an agreement but there were 
no preconditions and no agreements said foley dwash 
but supporters of the tax cut read bushs statement differently 
and it has rejuvenated the issue which had been hovering ghostlike 
ever since democrats barely succeeded in blocking a cut last year 
when the speaker and other democratic leaders joined bush 
tuesday in endorsing a statement that a tax revenue increase 
was needed the next two words were growth incentives 
in the code of capitol hill that almost always refers to a cut 
in the capital gains tax rate which would affect people who sell 
investments such as stocks or a second home at a profit 
i think we should use the current budget negotiations as a 
brandnew opportunity to put forward a pure progrowth capital 
gains initiative said sen robert kasten rwis said after 
bushs announcement 
the democratic study group an organization which foley used to 
head countered the republicans with a letter signed by 134 members 
saying that if the president insists that we need new taxes we 
feel they must be levied against those at the very high end of 
the income scale 
the rhetoric is a prelude to what eventually must be tackled in 
the closeddoor budget talks between congress and the white house 
the negotiators continued their meetings thursday first with 
discussions of possible cuts in benefit programs and pentagon 
spending but recessed for the night with no decisions made 
bargainers said 
reducing spending on the entitlement programs which include 
social security and medicare is extremely sensitive politically 
because so many voters could be directly affected 
everybody flinched sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said to 
describe the negotiators reactions when those reductions were 
discussed 
a proposal to reduce military spending by roughly 5 percent next 
year to about 290 billion was offered by rep leon panetta 
dcalif and chairman of the house budget committee talks on that 
topic were to continue friday 
bush maintained as part of his 1988 campaign that cutting the 
tax would increase federal tax revenues by luring more people into 
investments that help the economy to grow the 1986 tax overhaul 
had eliminated the tax differential on the theory that the economy 
was best served by a neutral system 
democrats said bush was trying a reprise of failed trickledown 
economics and when he pushed his plan last year they waged their 
fiercest battle against the new president 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo spearheaded the 
debate and portrayed bush as trying to further enrich his wealthy 
friends an attack bush later complained was too personal 
the democrats lost in the house but succeeded in blocking bushs 
plan with procedural maneuvers in the senate 
however a clear majority in both chambers favored the idea and 
opponents including bentsen chairman of the senate finance 
committee indicated they could go along with it if it were part of 
a fair package of deficitreduction measures 
foley said thursday he agreed with the position of democratic 
liberals who point to statistics showing that the bulk of the 
benefits from a capital gains tax cut would go to the wealthiest 
members of american society 
i think the position that they want to see tax equity is 
one that i understand and support foley said but that does 
not say there is some kind of absolute condition on the specifics 
i think ultimately there has to be some type of capital gains 
reduction said rep ed jenkins dga one of the democrats who 
voted with the president last year 
jenkins a member of the taxwriting ways and means committee 
said he could support combining the capital gains cut with a rise 
in the marginal tax rate for the wealthy under the 1986 tax law 
people making more than 200000 a year pay less on each additional 
dollar in income than do those who make half that much 
one top democratic aide said democrats who fought bush on 
capital gains last year might be willing to accept some sort of 
reduction if it were part of an overall budget and tax package that 
forced the wealthy to pay more taxes such as raising that top 
income tax rate 
i think the question is whether you can raise taxes on the 
rich given bushs presumed continued opposition to raising income 
tax rates said the aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
do you want to double what the rich are paying and then give a 
little of it back to finance a tax break for some of them 
sen alan k simpson rwyo predicted flatly that a capital 
gains cut will be part of the package 
a capital gains tax reduction can be well described in the 
vernacular of a tax revenue increase said simpson the deputy 
republican leader equity arguments aside estimates show reducing 
the capital gains rate would in the short term increase tax 
revenues as people shift their money into new investments to take 
advantage of the break

know how fuzzy the world looks when you peer 
through someone elses glasses thats how the universe looks to 
the hubble space telescope 
one of two mirrors that collect and reflect star light aboard 
the 15 billion telescope was somehow built with a microscopic 
error in how it focuses light 
the surfaces of both the primary and secondary mirrors on hubble 
are perfectly smooth and both are curved to cause light to be 
magnified the problem says nasa scientist ed weiler is that 
one is slightly too convex or too concave 
this means that the curve of the surface is not aligned 
perfectly with the curve of the other mirror so that the reflected 
light collected in the telescope instruments is slightly scattered 
the result is that the concentrated starlight has a slightly 
fuzzy look there are no sharp crisp edges it is similar to the 
effect when a film projector is not adjusted properly 
weiler said the error is minute the precise focus error is only 
2 microns a distance about equal to 4 percent of the diameter of a 
human hair 
but its enough to seriously blur hubbles celestial sight

the american medical association thursday threw 
its support behind voluntary record labeling by the music industry 
and declared its concern about the impact of destructive themes in 
certain kinds of rock music 
just as we got into tobacco and we got into alcohol we should 
be in all aspects of preventive medicine said james s todd 
executive vice president of the 290000member ama the nations 
largest physicians group 
at its annual convention the ama said vivid depiction of for 
example drug use demonology and racism could harm young people 
and urged the music industry to label its goods something it 
already does voluntarily 
a statement adopted by the amas 436member house of delegates 
reads the vivid depiction of drug and alcohol use suicide 
violence demonology sexual exploitation racism and bigotry could 
be harmful to some young people especially vulnerable children and 
adolescents who are socially alienated from traditional value 
systems and positive support groups 
the music targeted includes heavy metal punk rock and rap 
the chairman of the committee that debated the issue said the 
ama was not seeking to censor but simply to ensure that parents 
know of possible dangers to their children 
i wouldnt want us to be seen as moral arbiters said neil 
o ward an otolaryngologist from phoenix 
were not wanting to dictate whats on the marketplace as 
much as to make people aware of the destructive themes and make 
them aware of the dangers to family and adolescent health 
the move was lauded by the parents music resource center the 
educational group founded by tipper gore 
with the inclusion of the ama we now have a very strong 
message to the music industry that educators parents and medical 
professionals share a very valid concern about the messages 
marketed to young people jennifer norwood executive director of 
the center said in a telephone interview from her office in 
arlington va 
the american academy of pediatrics which has 39000 members 
adopted a policy last year asking the music industry to exercise 
taste and restraint 
but music industry representatives pointed out that record 
companies already label music voluntarily 
the ama is a little late on this said tanya blackwood 
spokeswoman for the recording industry association of america 
whose members produce about 90 percent of the recordings made and 
sold in the united states 
in 1985 the recording association reached an agreement with the 
parents music resource center and the national pta for voluntary 
labeling 
last month the recording association established a standard 
label also voluntary that is affixed to the permanent packaging 
on compact discs records and cassettes 
norwood said she believes about 90 percent of the industry uses 
labels 
the ama statement was adopted as the delegates wrapped up their 
annual fiveday policymaking convention 
measures accompanying the statement call on the music industry 
to label albums voluntarily and on the entertainment industry to 
exercise greater responsibility in presenting music to young 
people 
but blackwood said we are being responsible in the fact that 
we are voluntarily labeling products and weve been doing so for 
five years 
the doctors also urged parents to monitor the concerts their 
children attend the music videos they watch and the albums they

jurors in marion barrys drug and perjury 
trial watched a riveting videotape thursday showing the mayor 
smoking crack cocaine and then being arrested by fbi agents during 
a hotelroom sting operation 
the fuzzy tape shows barry twice inhaling from a pipe and a few 
moments later agents bursting into the room where he had come at 
the invitation of a longtime friend cooperating with the fbi 
i didnt do anything barry said at first then realizing 
his situation he muttered ive been set up and uttered a 
string of expletives at the friend exmodel rasheeda moore 
barry talking as much to himself as anyone else in the room 
repeated his curses and complaints over and over as fbi agents and 
city police searched him and carried out other routine postarrest 
procedures 
so what do you think about all this one police officer 
asked politely 
im pissed off i should have followed my goddamn instinct and 
not come up here barry said simple as that 
as the videotape was played barry studied a transcript in the 
courtroom his wife effi stared expressionless at a television 
monitor moore seated on the witness stand viewed the tape on a 
small television set nearby 
asked during a break in the proceedings how he felt about the 
tape barry smiled slightly but did not speak 
barry attorney r kenneth mundy began crossexamination shortly 
before the trial adjourned for the day quickly asserting i 
think she brought up the subject of drugs 
mundy contended moore had cooperated with the government because 
she needed money 
the tape was the talk of the city where barry retains 
substantial popularity it was played and replayed on local 
television stations interrupted only by newscasters and 
washington residents comments 
the crowd around a bank of television sets at one department 
store included joe perry who sighed and said he didnt want to 
go up to that hotel room in the first place but he was so arrogant 
that he thought he was bulletproof 
three fbi cameras hidden in a downtown hotel room recorded 
barrys visit to moores room on jan 18 and his purchase of an 
amount of the drug from an undercover agent posing as a friend of 
moores 
the tape shows barry initially expressed reluctance to smoke the 
cocaine unless moore did so too 
she declined his repeated requests saying it makes me too 
hyper i get really hyper 
you do it he insisted 
no im not doing nothing she replied 
no you do it he repeated 
i thought you bought this cause you wanted to take a hit 
moore said 
aw naw you do it responded barry 
but she didnt 
at one point barry said of a drug pipe i dont know how this 
work i never done it before but a few moments later he 
walked over to a dresser picked up the pipe lit it and inhaled 
the drug he appeared momentarily wobbly moore was across the 
room barry then inhaled again and the federal agents burst into 
the room moments later 
barry acknowledged a month ago that he smoked crack that night 
and said federal prosecutors were trying to kill him by providing a 
potentially lethal dose of the drug 
his lawyer contends the mayor was the victim of government 
entrapment a reluctant inexperienced drug user on the night in 
question 
however moore testified wednesday that she and barry used 
illegal drugs together more than 100 times over several years 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor 
cocainepossession charges one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy 
charge and three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use one possession charge stems from the night of his 
arrest 
the videotape was shown after a morning of testimony during 
which moore said barry was reluctant to come to her room 
in one telephone call between the two tape recorded by federal 
agents and played for the jury he complained there are too many 
nosy rosies around 
the videotape shows barry asking moore if her friend wanda the 
undercover agent would mess around 
yeah sometimes moore said she toots snorts cocaine 
more than shell do anything else 
later barry said lets go talk to her 
barry first gae moore money she testified it was 100 to buy 
drugs from wanda after the undercover agent returned to the room 
the two went into the bathroom and moore emerged with a packet 
the tape showed 
barry only looked at the packet as wanda left saying i dont 
smoke no more honey 
you dont want to smoke moore asked barry 
oh just powder he answered 
but several minutes later after moore has said she didnt get 
any new drugs from wanda barry asked her to get the crack back and 
provided her with 20 the tape showed 
after debating about who would smoke first barry finally did 
and was arrested shortly afterward 
jurors in the case also saw barry attempting to rekindle what 
moore has described as a longtime sexual relationship 
can we make love before you leave before you leave town 
the mayor asked at one point it would be a good idea just for 
old time sake you know catch up 
moore resisted 
i cant caress your breast barry asked moore 
im serious moore said 
i cant caress your breast the mayor repeated 
moore testified wednesday that she stopped sleeping with barry 
in june 1988 because there were too many drugs during that 
period 
before the phone call and the video recordings were played 
moore testified that she is a recovering alcoholic and cocaine 
addict she said it had been only 45 days since she last abused 
cocaine or alcohol 
she testified that barry told her at one point he was addicted 
to cocaine she also said she was concerned for barrys health 
in an additional development us district court judge thomas 
penfield jackson barred nation of islam leader louis farrakhan from 
the courtroom saying his presence would be potentially 
disruptive and very likely intimidating 
mundy said he likely would appeal that decision on friday

a search of rock n roll great chuck 
berrys home turned up drugs and guns authorities told reporters 
and berry 
berry made a surprise visit to a news conference he sat quietly 
as officials recited a laundry list of items including his 
drivers license removed from his estate in wentzville about 40 
miles west of st louis 
the estate was raided saturday while berry 63 was away 
st charles county drug agents found and seized several plastic 
bags of marijuana an unspecified quantity of hashish two rifles 
and a shotgun 122000 and pornographic videotapes slides and 
books said county prosecuting attorney william hannah 
no charges were filed hannah said none could be filed until all 
the evidence was reviewed probably not before tuesday 
in an affidavit filed in circuit court authorities outlined a 
continuing investigation of berry dating from december 1988 the 
investigation began after federal drug agents said they suspected 
berry of carrying cocaine in his guitar case and briefcase 
in march 1989 authorities at st louis lambert airport 
searched berrys baggage but found nothing the affidavit said 
the investigation intensified last week when an informant told 
authorities berry had received a large amount of cocaine and would 
have it at his estate for 10 days according to the affidavit 
but saturdays raid found no cocaine 
we would have felt better if cocaine was found hannah said 
but that doesnt negate the search were going to look at it the 
same whether cocaine was found or not 
berrys attorney wayne schoeneberg questioned the basis for 
the investigation and called some of the allegations in the 
affidavit ludicrous 
i have never used cocaine and nobody in my band has used 
it berry known for hits like johnny b goode told 
reporters after the news conference 
according to schoeneberg the affidavit also alleged berry had 
36 million in liquid assets of which 9 million was obtained 
through drug sales 
wheres the cocaine where did they come up with that this 
whole thing is a tragedy to me schoeneberg said 
he said he believed the raid was connected to a civil lawsuit 
filed in december by a former cook at berrys southern air 
restaurant in wentzville who alleged berry videotaped her and other 
women in the ladies room

videotapes of a criminal defendant taking a 
bribe selling drugs or plotting wrongdoing are powerful evidence 
difficult though not always impossible to explain away defense 
lawyers say 
the videotaped image of marion barry putting a makeshift pipe to 
his mouth and smoking crack cocaine is just the latest in a series 
of wellknown undercover operations captured on tape for juries to 
see 
prosecutors say such evidence is powerful because it puts 
defendants in a defensive posture trying to come up with an 
innocent explanation for what jurors can see with their own eyes 
generally speaking if you get the tapes on and unless the 
defendant can seriously damage the tape with other evidence 
unless the tapes are deficient they generally work said william 
c hendricks iii former head of the justice departments fraud 
section 
the videotape camera was an effective tool in the justice 
departments abscam bribery investigation that resulted in the 
convictions of seven members of congress in the early 1980s 
for example a tape of rep michael ozzie myers dpa 
taking a 50000 payoff from an undercover fbi agent posing as an 
arab shiek led to the lawmakers conviction and expulsion from 
congress 
for defense lawyers videotaped evidence poses problems that 
generally are momentous since it is the prosecution that is 
staging the event in the sting operation said richard 
benveniste who defended a philadelphia lawyer convicted in abscam 
at best an appearance in front of a hidden camera by an 
individual who later finds himself a defendant in court is 
ordinarily not going to be a very pleasant thing to watch 
benveniste said 
but in a few notable cases defense lawyers who challenged the 
conduct of police or federal agents who ran sting operations 
have won acquittals for their clients 
automobile maker john z de lorean was acquitted in 1984 of 
participating in a 24 million cocaine conspiracy despite a tape 
showing him looking into a suitcase purportedly filled with drugs 
and saying its better than gold gold weighs more than that 
for gods sake 
defense attorneys put the conduct of government agents on trial 
eliciting admissions that an fbi agent destroyed potential evidence 
and a drug enforcement administration agent backdated documents in 
violation of agency policy 
the defense argued that de lorean was pressured into 
participating in the drug deal claiming there were death threats 
against his children if he backed out 
what the defense can do is highlight the means under which the 
recorded portion of the evidence was set up benveniste said 
as in the de lorean case barrys lawyers are contending that 
the mayor was the victim of entrapment the tape of barrys 
encounter with rasheeda moore at the vista hotel provides the 
defense with material for arguing the mayor was coaxed into smoking 
crack despite his reluctance 
in the barry case there is substantial ammunition if you are 
dealing only with that incident that resulted in the mayors 
arrest on jan 18 in a downtown hotel room where he was invited by 
a friend cooperating with the fbi 
the defense will try to show that this was really the misuse 
of great authority to utilize an attractive former girlfriend to 
get an individual using a controlled substance that he had not 
brought with him that the governent supplies along with the 
apparatus for using it benveniste said 
washington defense lawyer robert p watkins said he believes 
evidence of police misconduct helped win a 1976 acquittal of a 
former federal prosecutor who was videotaped taking money from an 
undercover policeman 
the evidence showed that the former prosecutor donald robinson 
was having an affair with a prostitute who was caught on camera 
selling credit cards she had stolen from her customers to the 
undercover sting operation 
robinson was lured in front of the camera and taped accepting 
the money in return for a file on police informants 
despite this evidence the tape was not enough to convict 
robinson who testified that his wife had received threatening 
phone calls 
watkins who represented robinson said the defense produced 
evidence that undercover police asked the prostitute to undress in 
their presence 
this evidence seriously hurt the credibility of the police 
watkins said 
it was a factor that didnt bear directly on the issue 
robinson was charged with but it certainly was i believe crucial 
in showing that these policemen were doing extracurricular things 
other than just running a sting operation 
you have to embrace the tapes and then explain them away 
watkins said thats what happened in this case the defense 
was able to answer the question why was this guy put in this 
situation

convicted nazi war criminal john demjanjuk 
should not be executed because sufficient doubt exists about his 
identity his lawyer told the supreme court in a final plea 
thursday 
yoram sheftel demjanjuks israeli attorney ended the longest 
appeal in israels history by asking the panel of five justices to 
overturn the death sentence because of lingering doubt about 
demjanjuks guilt 
sheftel also asked the supreme court not to hand down a decision 
before jan 1 in order to give the defense time to investigate new 
evidence that might prove demjanjuks innocence 
there is no case that potentially could contain a mistake more 
than this case he said 
sheftel said the justices should find demjanjuk innocent a 
victim of mistaken identity 
the appeal began on may 14 and included 13 days for defense 
arguments and 12 days for the prosecution 
chief justice meir shamgar said the justices would consider the 
request to postpone their decision but did not indicate when they 
would rule 
demjanjuk 70 a retired cleveland autoworker was convicted and 
sentenced to death in april 1988 for crimes against humanity and 
crimes against the jewish people his trial lasted 14 months 
the threejudge trial court agreed with the prosecution that 
demjanjuk was ivan the terrible a ukrainian gaschamber 
operator at the treblinka death camp in world war ii who raped and 
beat jews as they were forced into the gas chambers 
more than 850000 jews were murdered at treblinka in 
nazioccupied poland in 194243 
a ukrainian native demjanjuk claims he is a victim of mistaken 
identity and says he spent those years in german pow camps as a 
captured soviet soldier demjanjuk changed his first name from ivan 
to john when he became a us citizen in 1958 
demjanjuks 24yearold son john jr said the defense hopes to 
question a treblinka guard who claimed in a 1979 statement to 
soviet investigators that the surname of the treblinka gaschamber 
operator was marchenko 
demjanjuks son said the guard failed to identify demjanjuk from 
photographs he said the defense just learned the guard is still 
alive and lives in the soviet union 
sheftel argued thursday that ivan the terrible is ivan 
marchenko a ukrainian guard who resembled demjanjuk 
the claim was supported by two affidavits from a guard who said 
marchenko was posted with him at treblinka and a deposition from a 
liquor store owner whose wife was a prostitute who slept with ivan 
the terrible sheftel said 
the liquor store owner identified ivan the terrible from a 1942 
photograph that prosecutors allege is of demjanjuk but said the 
man in the photo was named marchenko 
the name ivan marchenko also appears on a partial list of 
treblinka guards compiled by polish prosecutors 
marchenko is demjanjuks mothers maiden name which prosecutors 
claim demjanjuk sometimes used as an alias 
demjanjuk was identified from photo lineups by treblinka 
survivors he was also identified by otto horn a german nazi who 
supervised jews forced to take corpses from the gas chambers and 
arrange them in a burial pit 
five treblinka survivors and horn testified against demjanjuk 
demjanjuk was stripped of his us citizenship in 1981 and 
extradited to israel from ohio in february 1986 
demjanjuk was convicted in israel under a 1950 law allowing the 
prosecution of nazis and nazi collaborators it is the sole crime 
that permits the imposition of the death penalty in civilian courts 
in israel

in a major setback to the 
investigation into the slayings of six jesuit priests a colonel 
has denied hearing a colleague was involved in the massacre 
judiciary officials said thursday 
army col carlos aviles had been considered a crucial witness 
against col guillermo benavides a colleague who along with three 
lieutenants and five soldiers has been charged with the nov 16 
murders 
sources close to the case described aviles denial made in 
sworn testimony wednesday as a blow to successful prosecution of 
the case 
with the colonels testimony the case becomes even more 
difficult based on the evidence we have now id say there is 
about a 10 percent chance of taking the case to trial one 
prosecutor said 
the slow pace of the investigation along with the disappearance 
of evidence and witnesses has been criticized by a us 
congressional committee and officials of the roman catholic church 
authorities say a military death squad went to the jesuitrun 
central american university before dawn and shot the priests their 
housekeeper and her teenage daughter 
the usbacked military at first denied any connection to the 
killings which took place amid an offensive by leftist rebels in 
the capital the military had said the priests were rebel 
sympathizers 
the case blew wide open after a us military advisor said 
aviles told him on dec 20 that benavides was involved 
us army maj eric buckland in sworn testimony said benavides 
confessed his role to an officer who then told aviles 
us officials say aviles information was directly responsible 
for moving the investigation from detective work to the arrest 
stage all the named suspects are in custody except for one of the 
privates 
aviles denied wednesday telling buckland that benavides was 
involved said violeta lugo a government prosecutor 
col aviles denied having any information about col 
benavides supposed role in the massacre much less having passed 
such information on to the us major ms lugo said he said 
he went to the us major after this version of events became 
public to rebuke him for involving him aviles 
aviles gave his testimony to judge ricardo zamora who is in 
charge of the investigation zamora on wednesday issued a warrant 
for the arrest of lt col camilo hernandez for allegedly taking 
part in a coverup 
hernandez allegedly ordered the burning of military log books 
that traced the movements of the troops accused of carrying out the 
massacre hernandez said thursday he was awaiting orders from his 
superiors before turning himself in 
hernandez said he was awaiting instructions from either the 
defense minister gen humberto larios or from the chief of the 
joint chiefs of staff col rene ponce 
larios has repeatedly pledged full military cooperation with the 
investigation 
no salvadoran officer has ever been prosecuted for a human 
rights crime despite the deaths of tens of thousands of people at 
the hands of death squads linked to the armed forces and to 
president alfredo cristianis arena party 
to date the only evidence presented against benavides has been 
that of other defendants which is not admissible in salvadoran 
courts two of three lieutenants leading the death squad said 
benavides ordered the massacre 
rightists considered the leftleaning priests subversives 
because they had said el salvadors decadelong revolution was a 
war on social and economic injustice rather than a reflection of 
international communist expansion 
the massacre provoked an international outcry and calls from 
some quarters in the us congress for sharp cuts in aid to el 
salvador the largest recipient of us aid in the hemisphere

the army is thinking about trimming 7000 
civilian jobs many of them in pennsylvania new jersey and texas 
it was announced thursday 
the reductions would come mostly at installations for the army 
materiel command which is the armys largest civilian employer 
the command is in charge of research development and 
procurement for equipment and weapons for the army its ammunition 
production and storage and the operation and maintenance of troop 
supply and storage distribution facilities 
many more announcements of such relatively minor reductions in 
the pentagons 11 millionstrong civilian work force are expected 
in the coming months and years given the pentagons current 
budgetcutting drive 
these are proposed not approved reductions the army told 
capitol hill lawmakers in a memo designed to inform them of the 
possible move 
in view of the continued decrease in military forces plans 
are being implemented to reduce appropriate civilian support 
activities through fiscal year 1994 the memo said 
the army said it would inform lawmakers as the reductions are 
approved 
in proposals submitted to defense secretary dick cheney earlier 
this year the army also has proposed cuts in its active duty force 
that would take one soldier in four out of the ranks 
currently there are some 2 million men and women in the armed 
services and about 745000 in the army 
in the memo sent to capitol hill the army said it recognized 
the hardship that will result from the reductions in the civilian 
job force and that every effort is being made to ease the trauma 
precipitated by these displacements 
the three states that could be hit hardest by the proposal 
include pennsylvania which leads with 1122 proposed cuts 
followed by texas with 1006 reductions and new jersey with 943 
the reductions could be made on an involuntary basis unless the 
office of personnel management gives the army the authority to 
grant voluntary early retirement to older employees the army said 
the proposed cuts announced thursday in each state are alabama 
805 california 268 colorado 95 georgia 68 indiana 6 
illinois 449 iowa 4 kansas 2 kentucky 447 louisiana 85 
michigan 535 maryland 84 missouri 565 mississippi 31

a former police chief was sentenced to 
seven to 10 years in state prison after pleading guilty to stealing 
cocaine from his departments evidence room 
richard j sproules also was sentenced to a concurrent 
sevento10year term for embezzling city funds and to three to 
five years on two counts of intimidation of a witness and one count 
of attempting to procure another to commit perjury 
sproules 46 is believed to be the highestranking 
massachusetts police officer to be charged with drug offenses 
in a plea for leniency sproules told plymouth county superior 
court judge suzanne v delvecchio my actions are inexcusable 
for all the youngsters who looked up to me im ashamed you 
look at me a ruined and destroyed man but theres no one to blame 
but me 
sproules who had faced up to 35 years in prison had originally 
pleaded innocent to seven indictments 
on thursday he pleaded guilty to the cocaine theft charge 
sproules had planned to acknowledge there was sufficient evidence 
to convict him of stealing city money but not to admit to all of 
the allegations delvecchio however refused to accept that plea 
and found him guilty of the embezzlement charge 
state police arrested sproules who had been a leader in the 
fight against drugs in brockton in his office oct 24 
the arrest shocked this city of 95000 people 23 miles south of 
boston he had been proclaimed the citys best hope in the fight 
against drugs when he was appointed police chief in 1987 
a grand jury indicted sproules last year on charges of larceny 
of cocaine attempting to get another person to commit perjury 
obstruction of justice larceny of more than 250 and two counts of 
intimidation of a witness 
the same grand jury indicted him on a charge of embezzlement 
last march 
no action was planned on the charges of obstruction of justice 
and of larceny in excess of 250 said dolores sullivan of the 
court clerks office 
the norfolk county district attorneys office investigated the 
case because sproules and plymouth county district attorney william 
omalley have been friends since childhood 
sproules attorney bruce edmands said wednesday they had 
accounted for all but about 4300 of nearly 200000 sproules 
controlled as police chief 
sproules did not steal money for his own use but spent city 
money inappropriately on police operations edmands said 
but prosecutors said in court thursday that 74764 in city 
funds remain unaccounted for

bombs exploded in beirut and two southern 
cities thursday killing a 7yearold girl and wounding 13 police 
said 
the girl was slain in a bomb blast that wrecked the firstfloor 
office of the proiraqi baath arab socialist party in the southern 
provincial capital of sidon four people were wounded police said 
iraq and syria ruled by rival wings of the baath party have 
been feuding for 11 years 
an hour earlier a car bomb exploded 400 yards from a syrian 
army checkpoint in the talel elkhayyat district of moslem west 
beirut wounding six a police spokesman said 
the compact car which had been parked in the street for more 
than a week contained about 66 pounds of dynamite the spokesman 
said on condition of anonymity 
the explosion shattered windows damaged apartment buildings and 
set five cars on fire it was the fifth car bombing in lebanon this 
year by police count two people were killed and 31 wounded in 
earlier explosions 
the third bomb exploded before dawn outside a plo office in the 
palestinian refugee camp at rashidiyeh 50 miles south of beirut 
three palestine liberation organization guerrillas were wounded 
police reported 
the bombing came 11 days after guerrillas loyal to plo chairman 
yasser arafat cracked down on supporters of renegade terrorist 
mastermind abu nidal in rashidiyeh leaving four people dead and 16 
wounded 
as is usual with bombings in lebanon there were no claims of 
responsibility for thursdays blasts by any of the armed groups in 
the splintered country 
there has been a chain of bombings since the syrian army moved 
into west beirut in 1987 to quell militia anarchy it has been seen 
as a campaign designed to undermine the syrian peacekeeping effort 
also in south lebanon police said one person was killed and two 
were wounded in clashes between the sidonbased nasserite popular 
organization of sunni moslem leader mustafa saad and militiamen of 
the israelibacked south lebanon army 
the clashes around the hilltop village of kfar falous east of 
sidon flared intermittently throughout the day with mortars 
rocketpropelled grenades and machine guns

peter chapman 39 of germantown was jailed without bail and a 
preliminary hearing was set for july 5 washington county circuit 
judge james schwalbach rejected a defense request to allow him to 
attend his sons funeral thursday 
defense lawyer jerome f statkus said his client would probably 
plead innocent to the charge of firstdegree intentional homicide 
which carries a mandatory life prison sentence on conviction 
statkus said later thursday he had withdrawn from the case 
because chapman lacked funds to hire a forensic pathologist to 
examine the childs body the court agreed to a public defenders 
request to delay the boys burial to allow for such an exam 
statkus said 
germantown police chief frank riemer said no motive for the 
killing was known 
riemer said it was the worst case he had dealt with in his 25 
years as chief of police in the milwaukee suburb 
the other cases ive had were understandable he said 
this is not understandable 
chapman initially told police his son was abducted sunday 
morning from his car outside a milwaukee service station 
but under questioning chapman changed his story and told police 
he awoke sunday morning and found his son dead he said he 
panicked put the body in his car and drove until finding a site 
for a grave 
he led authorities to the grave monday in a secluded wooded 
area of germantown police found the childs body in a hole with 
his head 4 inches below the surface and the rest of his body at a 
depth of up to 22 inches 
the coroners report said dirt was lodged in the boys esophagus 
and stomach indicating he had been smothered dirt was also found 
in the boys clenched hands and the position of his head arms and 
feet indicated he was struggling to breathe and claw his way out 
theres no way this is an accident not when you dig a hole 
put someone in it and cover it up riemer said thats just not 
accidental 
sheriff robert shulteis who supervises the county jail said 
chapman was being kept in isolation after he was harassed by other 
inmates 
chapman was not married to the boys mother gina godlewski 24 
of menomonee falls court records show she sought a restraining 
order against him earlier this year saying he had a history of 
physical abuse and looks at times like hes going to kill me 
a hearing over custody of the child had been scheduled for 
friday court officials said

jetliner at larnaca airport and taken to the central prison in 
nicosia he returned to cyprus after a decade of exile in paris 
speaking at a press conference government spokesman akis fantis 
said the deputy attorney general had ruled samson who was

samson was considered by greek cypriots a hero of the 5year 
uprising against british colonial rule in the 1950s cyprus became 
independent in 1960

environmentalists hailed a 3 billion 
10year program to protect floridas natural spaces from rampant 
development which gov bob martinez signed into law thursday 
probably for the first time in anybodys memory the state of 
florida has placed a priority on land acquisition and recognized 
that there is a need to preserve and conserve their lands said 
curt blair of the sierra clubs florida chapter 
i think were certainly on the cutting edge 
the preservation 2000 law which martinez proposed authorizes 
use of 30 million as collateral for the sale of 300 million in 
bonds for purchase of wetlands beaches scenic river areas and 
forests the 30 million would be raised by taxing realestate 
transfers and investments 
the republican governor signed the measure while on a 
reelection campaign stop in west palm beach 
preservation 2000 is the most ambitious land acquisition 
program in the nation and will enable florida to lead the way in 
protecting its environment for future generations martinez said 
the measure includes a commitment to sell the bonds through 
2000 but the legislature must return each year to reauthorize the 
300 million bond sale 
martinez original proposal would have authorized the entire 3 
billion once the bill was signed but lawmakers did not want to 
give up their constitutional yearbyyear authority over tax 
dollars 
environmentalists despite the prospect of having to fight anew 
each year acclaimed the measure as one of the strongest 
commitments in the country to save land from developers 
blair said other states like california and new york have 
similar programs but few are as large as floridas particularly if 
the entire 3 billion is authorized to buy environmentally 
sensitive land 
dominic calabro president of the florida taxwatch public 
interest group said the new program is good but warned that the 
state must beware of cheats 
we need to be very thoughtful and very careful as we purchase 
these lands he said we must make sure they are the correct 
and needed lands 
a state grand jury found recently that florida often pays far 
too much for environmental and recreational lands sometimes 
because owners overstate value and sometimes because of a law that 
lets the state pay 125 percent of value in some instances

thousands of workers demonstrated 
thursday in the industrial city of brasov to demand more radical 
economic reforms and the parliament backed plans by prime minister 
petre roman to introduce a market economy 
roman presented his new 23member cabinet composed largely of 
technocrats and experts at a joint session of both houses of 
parliament it includes few members of the interim cabinet that 
governed romania after communist dictator nicolae ceausescu was 
ousted and executed in december 
that government had been criticized for a lackluster pace of 
reform and in the case of some ministers allegedly close ties to 
ceausescu 
roman who also headed the interim government was entrusted 
last week by president ion iliescu with forming the new cabinet 
in his speech to parliament roman promised to carry out radical 
economic reforms to deal with the countrys economic crisis 
the present state of the economy can only be overcome by 
radical reform carried out in quick steps roman said plastic 
surgery and superficial adjustments of the old structures cannot 
but deepen our crisis 
he said an initial package of reform laws would be presented to 
parliament within six months 
he pledged to carry out the historic transition from a super 
centralized economy to a market economy saying the state must 
abandon to the greatest possible extent its role as proprietor and 
manager 
after the joint session the two houses met separately and 
overwhelmingly approved romans cabinet and program 
but opposition leaders who criticized romans interim 
government for limiting private enterprises to a maximum of 20 
employees remained skeptical that his current pledge of reform is 
sincere 
so far weve heard promises said radu campeanu leader of 
the national liberal party the largest opposition group i hope 
they come true but i dont know i dont know 
meanwhile in brasov the countrys secondlargest city about 
4000 workers staged a demonstration to demand more farreaching 
reforms shouting demands for real privatization and freedom 
and humanity witnesses said 
the demonstrators belong to a new independent union the 
territorial trade union convention of brasov which claims to 
represent some 300000 workers brasov about 80 miles north of 
bucharest was the scene of massive worker protests in 1987 that 
were suppressed by the ceausescu regime 
at thursdays demonstration the workers also called for 
safeguarding our intellectuals and students earlier this 
month vigilante miners answering a government appeal for support 
beat up students and other government opponents in bucharest after 
police broke up a 53day anticommunist protest 
in the western city of timisoara public transportation workers 
went on strike thursday to protest their obsolete equipment and 
lack of spare parts according to media reports 
in bucharest 300 students and several professors staged a 
oneday strike thursday to demand the release of student leader 
marian munteanu 
munteanu was arrested june 14 on charges of instigation and 
participation in violence he was one of the leaders of the 
marathon antigovernment protest in university square and was badly 
beaten by the miners 
the protests have been directed at iliescus national salvation 
front which opponents say is dominated by former communists 
iliescu and the front won an overwhelming victory in the may 20 
elections 
at his inauguration last week iliescu vowed to remove 
disgraced corrupt and incompetent persons in an apparent bow 
to opposition demands for the ouster of those compromised by 
serving under ceausescu 
the foreign minister in the interim government segiu celac who 
in the 1970s had been ceausescus personal translator was replaced 
with adrian nastase a former aide to iliescu and a spokesman for 
the front 
retaining their posts were culture minister andre plesu defense 
minister victor stanculescu and adrian severin the minister in 
charge of reform and relations with parliament 
doru viorel ursu was kept on as interior minister a post he 
assumed after his predecessor mihai chitac was ousted in the wake 
of violence that rocked the capital earlier this month 
most of the ministers in the new government are in their 40s and 
many hold doctorate degrees in fields related to their ministries

federal agents busted moneyexchange houses 
in eight texas cities along the mexican border thursday and 
arrested at least 19 people for money laundering officials said 
authorities said the undercover investigation was the most 
extensive yet of the socalled casas de cambio 
i think this will have a very significant impact not only on 
the texas border but all the way to san diego us attorney ron 
ederer told a news conference 
the 21monthlong investigation by the us customs service and 
the internal revenue service codenamed operation vagabond 
resulted in 26 arrest warrants and eight search andseizure 
warrants officials said 
agents served the warrants thursday at exchange houses in 
laredo del rio eagle pass roma hidalgo el paso and brownsville 
nineteen people were arrested and checks totaling 290000 were 
seized said john alanis of the irs criminal investigation 
division other arrests in san antonio were possible officials 
said 
the arrests effectively shut down some of the casas de cambio 
although authorities did not officially close the businesses 
ederer said 
they were involved in money laundering in one form or 
another ederer said 
undercover agents went to the exchange houses and offered money 
for pesos or checks telling the operators the money was linked to 
drugs said charles harrison acting head of the us customs 
office in san antonio 
in some cases the exchange houses did not file currency 
transaction reports required when more than 10000 is involved 
harrison said and in some cases the money flowed out of the 
country and back into the united states he said 
a total of 21 million in government money was laundered in the 
undercover probe authorities said 
ederer said he believes operation vagabond will send a message 
to other exchange houses laundering drug money 
the other casas de cambio are going to see what has happened 
and they dont know if this investigation still going on he 
said there are millions of dollars being laundered in these 
operations 
it is impossible to know how many casas de cambio operate along 
the united statesmexico border because the businesses are 
unregulated and can spring up from the trunk of a car ederer said 
in a hearing late last year in san antonio the us house 
banking committee heard testimony on the role casas de cambio play 
in laundering drug money

the wests major economies are expected to remain 
on a steady course over the next 18 months undisturbed by 
political and economic upheavals in eastern europe the 
organization for economic cooperation and development said friday 
the 24nation secretariat in its latest semiannual report 
said the inflationadjusted growth rate for its members is likely 
to remain steady in 1990 and 1991 at 29 percent down from 36 
percent in 1989 
inflation is expected to stay unchanged at an annual rate of 
around 45 percent in the oecd region through 1991 
david henderson head of the oecds economics and statistics 
department told journalists the orderly and undramatic 
evolution of oecd economies contrasts starkly with the uncertain 
reforms under way in central and eastern europe 
but he said developments in these countries with the exception 
of east germany arent likely to have much impact on the oecd 
economies exports and imports from central and eastern europe 
account for only 25 percent of the oecd total he said 
the oecd report says fears that german economic and monetary 
union could aggravate inflation may seem exaggerated given the 
resolve of german banking officials to keep inflation under control 
the oecd expects german inflation as measured by consumer prices 
to rise to 33 percent in 1991 from 26 percent this year and 31 
percent in 1989 germanys growth rate is likely to remain around 
last years 4 percent level but a deceleration to 34 percent is 
projected for 1991 
the report said the us economy should settle down to a growth 
rate of 23 percent this year and 25 percent in 1991 compared 
with 3 percent in 1989 and 44 percent in 1988 
inflation is projected to rise to 48 percent this year before 
easing to 46 percent in 1991 
the oecd report expresses concern over the size of the us 
federal deficit which it says could reach 135 billion in both 
1990 and 1991 
oecd officials agreed president bushs shift in favor of tax 
revenue increases has improved the budget outlook 
the oecd said japans economy is likely to grow by 47 percent 
this year slowing to 4 percent in 1991 inflation may accelerate 
by about one percentage point to 28 percent this year before 
easing to 25 percent in 1991 
with the internationalization of the japanese economy 
proceeding rapidly both further liberalization of the domestic 
market and policies to stimulate competition are needed both 
for the benefit of japanese consumers and to avoid trade 
friction the report said 
the oecd projects a steady decline in britains current account 
deficit in 1990 and 1991 with inflation subsiding from the second 
half of this year onwards 
france gets a clean bill of health with practically all its 
economic indicators expected to move in the right direction while 
growth continues at a 3 percent annual rate 
eastern european countries probably will have to rely on their 
own austerity measures rather than outside help to finance 
restructuring of their economies the oecd also said 
the organization said in its annual report on the region that 
eastern european governments must provide stronger incentives for 
their citizens to save money 
the flow of public and private funds into the region from abroad 
may increase in coming years the oecd said but the broad economic 
significance of these funds is likely to be modest and may not 
offset the loss of soviet energy subsidies 
financing of economic restructuring in central and eastern 
european is thus likely to be dependent on strong domestic savings 
flows the report said 
the oecd said private foreign investment is widely viewed as a 
panacea for eastern europes economic adjustment problems but it 
suggested this view should be treated with caution 
the development of largescale private foreign investment is 
likely to depend on the pace of domestic reform processes in these 
economies particularly as regards the definition of property 
rights which remains a murky area the report said 
except for east germany the report said eastern european 
countries face difficulty obtaining more foreign resources because 
their export earning potential is limited and existing debts 
restrict their borrowing capacity 
the flow of official government support is likely to increase 
with loans from the newly created european bank for reconstruction 
and development added to loans from the world bank and 
international monetary fund the oecd said but it said these sums 
which could total 6 billion this year are small in relation 
to potential requirements

a schoolteacher testified thursday that he spent 
two days in the hospital with injuries inflicted by a gang of 
teenagers in central park the night a female jogger was gangraped 
and nearly beaten to death

the rape and attempted murder of the jogger and assaults on 
loughlin and another man in a series of attacks in the park on 
april 19 1989

were a dozen or more people who looked like they were attacking 
him 
someone came up to me he said what are you looking at 
loughlin recalled then he called to some people in front of me 
and said heres one of those vigilantes they repeated the word 
vigilante they were approaching from 10 to 15 feet away 
the next thing i remember i was face down on the ground being 
hit in the back of the head loughlin said it appeared to be 
something heavy like a baseball bat i put one hand up to ward off 
the blows and i felt something hard and heavy and smooth

until he spotted a police car

the pilot of an f15 fighter jet did 
not know he had a live missile aboard until he fired it at another 
plane during a practice dogfight causing nearly 1 million damage 
the air force said thursday 
the pilot was suspended from flying and several other personnel 
including the wing commander were transferred to other duties 
the incident occurred march 19 while the two f15s from the 21st 
tactical fighter wing at elmendorf air force base were en route to 
the forward deployment base at king salmon 
the lead plane was carrying a practice training missile which 
simulates the weight of a real missile and remains attached to the 
plane the other aircraft was carrying one inert practice missile 
and one armed aim9m sidewinder the air force investigation board 
said in its report 
they were doing some practice intercepts 180 miles west of 
anchorage when the second plane mistakenly launched the armed 
heatseeking missile the alaskan air command said in the accident 
report released thursday 
the lead planes pilot immediately pulled the throttles to the 
idle position to cool the engines and increased the rate of turn to 
the left in an effort to evade the heatseeking missile the 
missile struck the left side of the planes tail and exploded 
knocking off the left horizontal stabilizer 
the warhead severely damaged the right rudder and fragments 
penetrated the external fuel tanks engine burner cans and left 
flap one fragment struck the left side of the fuselage just behind 
the cockpit the report said 
lt col jimmy harris pilot of the stricken plane regained 
control of the fighter after bringing it out of a roll jettisoned 
the external fuel tanks and returned to elmendorf 
the missile caused 992058 in damage to the 322 million 
f15c the air force said 
first lt michael lynch who was flying the fighter with the 
live missile was grounded pending the results of a review by a 
flight evaluation board said maj doug mccoy an elmendorf 
spokesman 
the accident report said although an entry was clearly 
present on a maintenance log that is required reading for pilots 
before takeoff evidence indicates that lt lynch was unaware 
that a live missile was on the aircraft mccoy said the command 
has changed the way it moves live missiles from one base to another 
we are still ferrying a combination of live missiles and 
practice training missiles to forward bases mccoy said but 
approval and training practices have been tightened

kneeling before an altar to the sun goddess and 
sipping sacred rice wine emperor akihitos youngest son wed his 
college sweetheart friday morning in a ceremony replete with 
symbolism 
the solemn 15minute ceremony at the shrine dedicated to the sun 
goddess amaterasu ended with the symbolic sipping of rice wine from 
a white ceramic cup sealing prince ayas nuptial bonds with 
graduate student kiko kawashima 
miss kawashima who has no royal background has generally been 
welcomed as representing another step in bringing the palace and 
japans people closer together she is the second commoner to marry 
into the royal family empress michiko became the first when she 
and akihito then crown prince wed in 1959 
the wedding was the first for an imperial family member in six 
years and the first in three decades for a prince of ayas rank 
aya 24 is second in line to the chrysanthemum throne after his 
elder brother crown prince naruhito 30 who has yet to marry 
clad in the black silk robe and cap with arched tailpiece that 
designate him as an imperial prince aya and miss kawashima 23 
walked to the shrine in slow deliberate steps an attendant 
carried the train of the brides green maroon and orange kimono 
nearly a dozen layers thick 
prime minister toshiki kaifu and other government leaders and 
imperial family members were among the 156 guests watching from 
outside the wooden kashikodokoro shrine 
in the ceremony the prince kneeling beside his bride made 
vows to the sun goddess in the classical japanese used by priests 
of japans indigenous shinto religion 
reflecting the royal couples special fondness for thailand a 
country they have both visited thai princess maha chakri 
sirindhorn was also invited to the wedding the first member of a 
foreign royal family to receive such an honor 
ayas royal parents in keeping with tradition were absent 
friday morning but like the rest of the nation could watch the 
ceremony on live television they will receive the couple later in 
the afternoon in the imperial palace 
the emperor was also to bestow aya with a new title prince 
akishino to mark ayas establishing an independent household 
akishino is the name of a town in western japan with close ties to 
the imperial family 
many aspects of the wedding ceremony closely followed imperial 
traditions some going back 1000 years or more 
traditions aside the ceremony was being hailed as the publics 
first taste of the new imperial era called heisei or achieving 
peace which began with the death of emperor hirohito on jan 7 
1989 
akihito ascended the throne immediately afterward and he has 
been credited with trying to create a more open softer image for 
japans often distant and mysterious imperial family 
this is the first big event of the heisei era said former 
imperial chamberlain minoru hamao who served as a close attendant 
to akihito for 20 years 
the princess is the perfect person for todays imperial 
household and im sure that as time goes on she will gradually 
help bring the monarchy even closer to the people he told the 
associated press 
though miss kawashima has not created a sensation along the 
lines of the michiko boom her warm smile and quiet 
conservative manner have won over much of the public 
because of her relatively humble background her father is an 
economics professor at gakushuin university a former peers school 
she was called a modernday cinderella by the popular media 
she was also dubbed the apartment princess because she lived 
with her family in faculty housing on the gakushuin campus where 
she is working on her masters degree in social psychology 
aya a gakushuin graduate met miss kawashima at a bookstore on 
the campus in 1985 
soon after their engagement was approved by the government in 
september it was rumored that aya and miss kawashima would 
honeymoon in thailand a country aya particularly likes 
for the honeymoon however tradition has taken precedence the 
royal couples first trip together will be to the grand shrines of 
ise and the tomb of the emperor jimmu both in central japan 
emperor jimmu according to myth was japans first monarch and 
ascended in 660 bc 
police say that because of threats from leftist radicals 9000 
officers were assigned to guard the wedding activities though most 
were being held at either the imperial palace which is surrounded 
by a moat and forbidding stone walls or the akasaka palace the 
wellsecured residence of the emperor and empress

country music star willie nelson will pay 65 
million in personal and business taxes and penalties stretching 
back to 1972 under a settlement with the government approved by a 
tax court judge 
documents made available thursday show nelson was penalized 
under sections of the tax code regarding negligence failure to 
file a tax return and failure to pay taxes 
tax court judge mary ann cohen approved the settlement june 6 
nelsons tax trouble began in october 1984 when internal revenue 
service investigators alleged he owed 16 million in back taxes 
for 1972 through 1978 in may 1988 the irs charged he owed another 
94 million for 1979 through 1983 the irs assessed hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in penalties both times 
the singer disputed the charges in lawsuits filed in us tax 
court in 1985 and 1988 
nelsons attorney charles meadows jr of dallas said he would 
not discuss the case nelson did not immediately return phone 
messages left at his motel in powell wyo where he will perform 
friday night 
nelson is best known for his songs on the road again my 
heroes have always been cowboys and you were always on my 
mind he also performed in the movies honeysuckle rose and 
barbarosa 
the tax documents indicate nelson must pay 58 million in 
personal taxes and a penalty of about 500000 his music company 
must pay about 139000 in taxes plus a penalty of about 29000 
the irs initially charged nelson with civil tax fraud saying he 
understated his taxable income through unreported earnings and 
improper deductions 
but judge cohen assessed no penalty under the fraud provisions 
of the tax code 
nelsons attorneys also successfully argued that his company was 
not liable for about 728000 in personal holding company tax such 
a tax at a rate of up to 70 percent is imposed on undistributed 
earnings from personal services 
nelsons attorneys argued those earnings were all distributed to 
nelson and members of his band most of the companys money comes 
from royalties nelson established the company to meet a music 
publishing houses requirement for royalty distribution 
nelson 57 was born in abbott texas and grew up playing for 
tips at central texas beer joints and ice houses he now lives near 
austin 
he will be there next wednesday for his annual fourth of july 
picnic a tradition that grew from a 1971 reunion of texas 
musicians and now attracts thousands

nasa started a formal investigation into why 
the hubble space telescope was launched with a fuzzy focus as 
scientists searched thursday for ways to salvage some research from 
the flawed 15 billion observatory 
nasa officials said an investigation team led by jet propulsion 
laboratory director lew allen was being organized 
at the same time engineers at a connecticut company that made 
the telescopes mirrors under a 450 million contract were trying 
to find out what went wrong during a yearslong process of grinding 
and polishing 
terence facey an executive with the hughes danbury optical co 
said that a study of signals from the hubble has led to the 
conclusion with fairly high certainty that one of two main 
mirrors in the telescope was ground or polished to wrong shape 
the shape is not correct he said thursday night but we 
dont know which one mirror it is 
facey said that records still exist on the tedious threeyear 
grinding and polishing effort to make the mirrors and that hughes 
danbury officials expect to be able to pinpoint precisely when and 
how the mistake was made 
jack rehnberg another hughes danbury official said earlier 
that a manufacturing error was a strong possibility and that his 
company was prepared to cooperate fully with nasas investigation 
national aeronautics and space administration officials 
announced wednesday that either the primary mirror or secondary 
mirror on hubble were not focusing light as they were supposed to 
giving blurred and lowlight images to the two cameras and three 
instruments on the spacecraft 
the flaw officials said cannot be repaired from the ground and 
the space observatory never will be able to capture all of the 
spectacular views of the universe that had been expected although 
a repair mission scheduled for 1993 may restore one camera 
nasa hubble scientist ed weiler said at a news conference 
thursday that a minute error in the curve of one of the mirrors 
causes the reflected light to miss a precise point of focus by only 
4 percent of the diameter of a human hair 
that is just enough to spoil the extremely sharp photos that 
astronomers expected from the telescope 
the hubble is comparable to a very good ground telescope on a 
very good night but its not better than the best he said 
weiler said the mirrors were tested individually before launch 
but never physically together as a unit because that would have 
cost several hundred million dollars 
instead nasa tested the two mirrors together through computer 
analysis he said but somewhere along the way something failed 
despite hubbles blurry view of the universe officials at the 
space telescope institute in baltimore hope to learn how to make 
the telescope produce usable views of the universe 
ray villard of the space telescope institute at johns hopkins 
university said scientists are recovering from the initial 
disappointment over the permanent focusing flaw and now are trying 
to find ways to compensate for it 
at first there was a lot of shock about the defect said 
villard now the wheels are turning some of the scientists are 
looking for clever and creative ways to work around the problem and 
do science 
villard said the institute which determines the scientific 
studies that were approved for hubble is in the process of 
completely reevaluating the 160 research proposals submitted by 
international teams of astronomers 
he said it was clear that a widefield camera the major camera 
on hubble is virtually useless with the focus distortion of the 
mirrors another instrument called the faintobject camera will 
be able to do some work but the images will not be sharp he 
said 
villard said the faintobject camera will be able to take 
pictures in the ultraviolet spectrum a part of star light that 
cannot be seen from earth 
two spectrographic instruments he said should be able to do 
a lot of science although in an inferior fashion the 
spectrographic instruments are used to determine the temperature 
motion and composition of stars data from these studies are 
usually expressed as numbers and graphs and not pictures 
another instrument the highspeed photometer will be able to 
conduct much of its work though exposures may take longer the 
photometer is used to measure the brightness of stars search for 
black holes and search for visible pulsars an object usually 
detected only by radio telescopes 
a replacement widefield camera is now being built at the jet 
propulsion laboratory in california and plans call for it to be 
delivered to hubble on a space shuttle flight in 1993 
the hubble was placed in a 381mile orbit by the space shuttle 
on april 25 nasa then started testing that was expected to take 
eight months 
nasa had said that the space telescope orbiting far above the 
obscuring effects of the atmosphere would be able to see objects 
25 times fainter than those seen from earth it was expected to be 
able to look to near the edge of the universe some 14 billion 
light years

prime minister yitzhak shamir said thursday 
that israel was willing to work with the united states toward a 
mutually acceptable peace plan but warned cooperation had to be 
tempered by israeli security concerns 
his remarks to a convention of the jewish agency came after he 
sent a letter to president bush reportedly proposing that 
palestinian peace negotiators be chosen on a namebyname basis 
israel radio said however that shamirs letter opposed the 
inclusion of deportees or palestinians from east jerusalem as 
suggested by secretary of state james a baker iii 
baker has been trying to revive a usbacked peace process that 
stalled in march when shamir and members of his rightwing likud 
bloc balked at baker proposals aimed at getting preliminary 
israelipalestinian talks under way 
at issue is the future of the 17 million palestinians who live 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip which were captured by 
israel from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
israel has proposed elections aimed at selecting palestinians to 
open talks on limited autonomy 
palestinians who hope to create an independent state in the 
territories have called for an international conference 
palestinian leaders have also insisted that they be represented 
by the palestine liberation organization which israel considers a 
terrorist group 
in his speech thursday shamir said that the us 
administration has to become convinced that we are sincere in our 
hope for peace and the wish to continue with our peace initiative 
he added in the end we are responsible for our future our 
fate and the security of the state he added 
from libya to iraq swords are being sharpened shamir said 
in a reference to recent threats from the arab world he described 
the plo as performing exercises of deceit and terror 
later shamir declined to answer reporters questions about the 
letter saying i want him bush to read it first 
the letter was sent in response to a letter from bush two weeks 
ago that urged israels new rightwing government to advance the 
peace process and requested answers to bakers proposals 
under the us plan a palestinian delegation would hold 
preliminary peace talks with israelis in cairo 
israel radio quoted shamirs letter as saying we are ready to 
continue to cooperate with secretary baker to advance a dialogue 
with a palestinian delegation that will be composed on a 
namebyname basis 
it continued but as you know mr president we disagree with 
the participation of deportees and arabs from jerusalem in the 
delegation 
israel television said shamir ruled out participation by 
deportees chosen by the plo

himself in the cuban flag im here to fight for human rights 
police kept the two groups separated although they shouted back 
and forth with megaphones and at least one fistfight was broken up 
in miami opinions tend to be very heartfelt said dade 
county commissioner charles dusseau one of the few local 
government officials inside the convention hall thats why you 
get this kind of reaction theres been a lot of suffering on both 
sides and its difficult for each side to understand the other

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
124 thursday for a bill that would impose sanctions on iraq 
because of human rights violations 
the measure said the iraqi government has systematically 
detained tortured and executed thousands of citizens 
depopulated kurdish areas of the country and murdered and tortured 
children to punish their parents 
the fate of the bill in the senate is uncertain the bush 
administration has opposed the measure 
the legislation would require the united states to oppose any 
lending to iraq by international financial institutions and bar 
us government credits to the country 
that would cost iraq 200 million a year in credits through the 
exportimport bank as well as even larger amounts in loan 
guarantees used to buy us farm products

the hubble space telescope is crippled by a 
focusing flaw that may have been caused by an undetected 
prescription error during the manufacture of polished mirrors 
aboard the 15 billion craft 
nasas announcement of the problem wednesday sent a shudder of 
disappointment through an astronomy community that has waited years 
for what were expected to be unprecedented views of the universe 
from the orbiting telescope 
the space agency said the focusing problem in the hubble mirrors 
cannot be fixed from the ground and at least two of the five 
instruments aboard the spacecraft will be virtually useless until a 
repair mission is flown by the space shuttle 
plans call for such a mission in 1993 but the national 
aeronautics and space administration said it hopes to make the 
flight sooner

ever wonder what network news anchors and talk 
show hosts do when they arent interviewing people by golly they 
get interviewed on talk or variety shows thats what they do 
consider next friday larry king who has a cnn talk show will 
talk on nbcs tonight show on july 13 jane pauley will be on 
nbcs late night with david letterman where she has appeared 
before 
deborah norville who succeeded her on today also has been 
on letterman so have such newsguests as tom brokaw john 
chancellor connie chung sam donaldson and maria shriver 
this month norville appeared on tonight so did abcs peter 
jennings although on a different evening cbs dan rather 
meanwhile was seen in a twopart interview on nbcs later with 
bob costas 
the network newsies for years have been interviewed by print 
reporters who grill them on the state of themselves their shows 
and even the cosmos 
but the appearances of network news stars on talk shows are on 
the rise and represent a form of cannibalism says reuven frank 
president of nbc news in 196873 and again in 198284 
it also is very new he says thirty years ago frank says 
it was really a big deal when a main news type would get on an 
interview show 
he recalls the time it took a direct order to the news division 
from robert kintner then president of nbc to put chet huntley and 
david brinkley coanchors of the huntleybrinkley report on 
the tonight show 
now no orders are needed an invitation arrives the newsfolk 
go 
why 
i dont know frank says its what is soandso really 
like its that game 
costas whose background is sports not news was himself 
interviewed this year on cbncs the dick cavett show but tvs 
news stars dont tend to go to that show they gravitate to costas 
halfhour later which has become a second home of sorts for 
them 
in addition to rather who first went there in 1988 later 
guests have included brokaw linda ellerbee mike wallace walter 
cronkite pauley jennings ted koppel pierre salinger and 
kathleen sullivan 
chung also was a guest in a twopart interview in september 1989 
when her saturday night with connie chung was just starting 
the first interview was with her the second show featured chung 
and her husband a current affair anchorman maury povich 
but costas doesnt get everyone it took barbara walters former 
cohost of today to land an interview with bryant gumbel of 
today that chat about the shows woes was broadcast in march 
on abcs 2020 
a month later the syndicated live with regis amp kathie lee 
landed an interview with abcs diane sawyer who talked about her 
upcoming exclusive interview of marla maples for primetime live 
maples is a friend of donald trump diplomatic observers say 
pickings apparently get so lean at times that tv stars interview 
each other this has happened at least twice so far this year 
talk show star phil donahue who has been interviewed on 
costas show interviewed talk show star joan rivers on his show 
in due course donahue was interviewed by her on her first show in 
new york 
in may chung was interviewed by arsenio hall on his syndicated 
show three nights later her face to face with connie chung 
special featured her taped interview with arsenio hall 
it isnt necessarily bad that a tv news star appears on a talk 
or variety show provided he or she does it with dignity says 
everette c dennis executive director of the gannett center for 
media studies 
that such appearances are common now but once were rare is due 
to changing times and managements at the networks he says 
networks once considered their news divisions as prestigious loss 
leaders 
now they want the divisions to turn a profit he says and 
this means they have to court the audience and to some extent 
its a pretty brazen courtship 
for the network anchors and star correspondents the aim of the 
game is publicity for their news programs the hope is that if 
viewers find the news types interesting and likeable theyll tune 
in their shows 
it doesnt stay just on watch me in my job and see how well i 
do dennis says now its gosh if youve never heard of me 
watch me on the talk show tonight you might like me 
former nbc news chief frank is more amused than alarmed about 
the trend 
its very silly he says here are these guys who do 
nothing but talk on their own shows and they have to go to another 
show to talk i think we ought to get em a 900 number they can 
call to talk 
is america doomed to even more anchorama 
frank sighed ive come to assume that reason will never set 
in he says but its another fad and it will burn itself out 
and theyll get somebody more interesting like experts

when communicating about taxes elected 
officials are at their subtle best some ask that you read their 
lips some speak from both corners of the mouth and many find 
refuge in semantics 
in the past presidents have raised revenues without ever using 
the word tax choosing instead such terms as user fees and 
surcharges or by closing loopholes by stricter enforcement or 
expanded collection efforts 
in his statement on reducing the budget deficit president bush 
did not mention tax increases he chose instead to say that he 
would seek tax revenue increases a term that could have 
considerable significance 
it is the contention of some tax authorities for example that 
it is possible to raise tax revenues while reducing taxes as on 
capital gains that argument is in fact a particular favorite of 
white house advisers 
their thesis is this 
when taxes are high on capital gains which are longterm 
profits from such matters as real estate and stock market 
transactions taxproducing activity is restrained rather than 
sell and pay taxes investors simply stay put 
the way to get these people to sell is to make it less onerous 
for them to do so lower the tax these advisers say and you will 
almost automatically release a rush of activity revenue would pour 
into uncle sams pockets 
true the revenue per transaction would be lower than before 
but everyone from the newspaper vendor to donald trump knows that 
you might make it up and more in volume harvard professors say 
so so does bush 
in fact bush has been as consistent in pushing for a capital 
gains tax reduction as he has been in saying no more taxes he made 
it a plank in his election platform and has reiterated it since 
in order to obtain it from congress however he might have to 
submit to pressures for higher taxes on such items as gasoline and 
cigarettes this of course would be interpreted as weakkneed 
reneging on his notax pledge 
no good politician would submit to that humiliation without a 
comeback and bush has one to his critics he might point out that 
the tax decrease he obtained more than offset the increased taxes 
in other areas 
in that sense he might say that while the revenue mix did 
indeed change the net effect was that one move nullified the other 
or even resulted in lower taxes thus no net tax increase 
although perhaps a revenue increase 
nevertheless any change in the tax situation is bound to bring 
out the critics and some of them are likely to be formerly strong 
supporters analysts at the heritage foundation a think tank 
highly influential in both the reagan and bush administration 
already have released blasts 
the general feeling among conservative analysts such as those 
at heritage is that by various measures taxes are near their 
alltime highs and that wasteful spending is too dont raise 
taxes they say cut spending instead 
theyve identified what they say are 130 billion in spending 
cuts and budget savings that could be made without damaging the 
social benefits safety net 
in no way they say would those savings come at the expense of 
the poor no matter what members of congress might say those 
savings might however come at the expense of the members pet 
projects 
analyst scott hodge indicates that hardly a spending bill is 
passed that doesnt contain a tail of pork an additional sum to 
satisfy their special interest or that of a constituent 
unsubtly he directly blames congress for squandering billions 
and states that taxpayers should no longer have to pinch pennies 
so that congress can spend them with abandon 
that suggests to the president a final fallback position if he 
has to accept the damage to his reputation if he has to accept a 
tax increase he can at least say he did his best but that congress 
forced him into it

twice a week clad in a filmy purple gown 
wearing deathly white makeup and a heavy black wig lee meriwether 
stands outside a sound stage and waves at the passing trams of the 
universal studios tour 
this is not a common occurrence on the tour few wellknown 
actors deign to make an appearance but meriwether star of the 
syndicated program the munsters today enjoys the attention 
it started when i was standing outside the stage one day when 
a tram came by the tour guide told them who i was i waved at 
them and they got a kick out of it she said 
one day a tram load of japanese tourists came by and nearly 
tilted over as everyone rushed to the side to take pictures said 
meriwether i wish id had a camera to take a picture of that 
meriwether is now at work on the third season of the munsters 
today a revival of the 1960s comedy series the original was 
something of a copy itself coming as it did on the heels of the 
popular show the addams family it was then and still is a 
spoof of domestic family sitcoms 
the munsters live at 1313 mockingbird lane in a musty gothic 
mansion each member of the family looks like a refugee from a 
horror flick 
herman the father is a gravedigger and dead ringer for 
frankensteins monster grandpa who looks like dracula tinkers 
with inventions in the basement 
the children are eddie a teenager who seems to be on his way 
to turning into a werewolf and marilyn a pretty young woman in 
the original show the rest of the munsters thought marilyn was 
abnormal and pitied her 
meriwethers lily is a vampire lily is basically your 
everyday mother in a sitcom said meriwether who was miss 
america in 1955 she adores her children she just looks 
different 
the actress revels in the shows monsterisms when she found a 
transylvania cookbook she bought dozens and gave them to friends 
the show has been brought up to date meriwether said the 
children have changed the most eddie no longer dresses in the 
little lord fauntleroy clothes he dresses as other teens do today 
we no longer worry about marilyns looks there was some talk 
that i would get a job 
the series features john schuck as herman howard morton as 
grandpa jason marsden as eddie and hillary van dyke as marilyn 
the original show broadcast on cbs from 196466 starred fred 
gwynne as herman yvonne decarlo as lily al lewis as grandpa 
butch patrick as eddie and beverly owen and later pat priest as 
marilyn 
meriwether did not give the munsters today much chance for 
survival 
first she said i thought it would be just a pilot i never 
thought it would become a series then i didnt think it would go 
beyond the first year 
it is now seen on more than 100 stations 
meriwether is a television veteran she had recurring roles on 
mission impossible dr kildare the fbi and 12 
oclock high as well as the time tunnel the new andy 
griffith show and barnaby jones 
in the last show she played betty jones the daughterinlaw of 
the eponymous character played by buddy ebsen that show originally 
was an episode of cannon but before they had completed the 
filming it became a spinoff and a new series it ran for eight 
seasons on cbs 
after barnaby jones left the air in 1980 she did mostly 
stage work and spent five years as an aerialist with circuses in 
switzerland sweden japan australia and south america she worked 
as a substitute with the flying gaonas and her daughter lesley 
aletter often worked with her 
i wasnt a gymnast said meriwether i did the simple 
tricks but lesley could do the unusual tricks 
lesley currently works as a film editor another daughter kyle 
aletter is an actress meriwether is married to marshall borden 
an actor writer and director and they frequently have worked 
together in regional theater

a lever to reveal an access cover for the engine 
the previa replaces toyotas previous passenger van which had 
the cab over the wheels for tight turning in japans crowded 
streets the new model has a more american design where the front 
passengers sit behind not over the front wheels

some cities have decided to make downtown look 
like downtown again 
they are doing away with their pedestrian malls bulldozing the 
kiosks trees and benches that replaced streets 20 or 30 years ago 
they are welcoming back the fumes and noises of oncebanished 
traffic 
and some that havent decided to return to the downtown of an 
earlier time are thinking about it 
it turns out said lawrence o houstoun jr that converting 
traditional shopping districts into a pedestrian malls worked but 
only for a while houstoun is an urban development consultant in 
cranbury nj 
dry rot has set in again in many central cities he said 
because office buildings which provide many of the shoppers 
have been erected on cheap land too far away for a lunchtime 
shopping stroll 
the pedestrian malls had some initial success because they 
were the first thing that looked good downtown but they didnt 
deal with the basic problem houstoun said 
the problem wasnt that people wanted to walk in the streets 
the problem was that downtown wasnt convenient or became 
inconvenient 
houstoun said studies have established that at lunch time 
people will walk for nine minutes or about three blocks from 
their office if stores are a block or two further away they will 
be shunned no matter how pleasant the environment 
so a number of the 200 or so cities that took the plunge in the 
late 1960s and the 1970s have undone or downscaled their malls or 
are considering it houstoun said he reported his findings in 
planning the magazine of the american planning association and 
elaborated in an interview 
kalamazoo mich which called itself mall city is 
reopening two blocks of its fourblock mall to traffic eugene 
ore removed the kiosks playgrounds restrooms and plantings from 
two blocks of its pedestrian mall 
new london conn brought back the cars three illinois cities 
danville champaign and rockford have given up their malls 
norfolk va and st joseph mo kept theirs but in smaller 
configurations in the capital of new jersey cars will return to 
part of trenton commons springfield mo welcomed cars back to 
much of its mall too we drive around the square again says 
bob turner acting director of public works 
but some cities find their mall still work well the mall in 
boulder colo is a standout and trafficchoked new york city is 
considering going the mall route by pedestrianizing 10 blocks 
of broadway 
a number of cities that would like to take out their pedestrian 
malls cant afford to said houstoun a former official in the 
departments of commerce and housing and urban development in 
washington 
often the malls were built with federal grants no federal money 
is available to undo them houstoun said it can cost 500000 to 
750000 a block to take out the pedestrian features that give 
urban malls their character 
the old urbane uppermiddleclass chicago suburb of oak park 
ill spent 31 million in 1988 to take out a mall that had been 
built 16 years earlier for 14 million 
in the process 84 quarterofacenturyold pin oak trees were 
removed those that could be saved were replanted elsewhere in the 
community of 55000 
but it absolutely was not a mistake to build oak park mall 
in the first place said christine burdick executive director of 
downtown oak park 
it helped stabilize what in 1972 had been a declining retail 
center and helped us maintain a viable retail business she said 
it worked it just became obsolete 
adds village manager neil nielson it served a life like 
anything else 
most oak park residents liked their mall no matter what 
merchants felt at the very time that streets curbs sewers and 
lighting were being reinstalled citizens voted 13000 to 9273 in 
a nonbinding initiative against tearing out the mall 
what happened was five department stores that had been mall 
anchors either went bankrupt or moved away and business fell 
off mrs burdick said 
restreeting her term for it has helped business mrs 
burdick said sales for the last quarter of 1989 were up 24 percent 
over the previous year 15 new retailers moved in the occupancy 
rate inched up from 75 to 80 percent 
in its dependence on anchors oak park mall more closely 
resembled onthehighway regional shopping malls than do most 
downtown malls 
downtown malls said houstoun typically rely on two different 
types of shoppers lowerincome city residents and office workers 
whose wants are not alike adding to the malls difficulty in 
finding a market 
office workers are important shoppers one study found that they 
spend an average of 1800 a year downtown on food and goods most 
of it during the lunch break 
in retrospect said houstoun cities might have been wiser to 
clear abandoned buildings from core areas making sites available 
for office buildings that would have provided the customers for 
downtown stores 
the pedestrian mall he said wasnt a remedy geared to the 
problem and removing them is not a cure for todays problems 
either

prime minister vp singhs 
administration rode the white horse of clean government into office 
and has launched an anticorruption campaign but many question 
whether it will succeed 
agreement seems general among western and indian diplomats and 
businessmen that singhs plan to shake up staterun trading firms 
and reform industrial policy will do little to stem indias rising 
tide of malfeasance 
some feel the expected failure will have little effect on this 
huge country of 880 million people and that india will lumber into 
the future as it has through the past 
many more believe however that continued corruption at current 
levels will break indias economy and threaten the stability of the 
worlds most populous democracy 
corruption poses a major problem for us said shankar 
acharya a ranking finance ministry official who made a 
groundbreaking study of indias black economy it seems to 
be growing daily 
the problem permeates indian society 
traffic cops expect baksheesh small bribes to ignore 
violations businessmen consider payoffs and kickbacks part of the 
job 
every business deal has a beneficiary said a high official 
of the state trading corp indias biggest staterun trading 
house if i make a little profit on a deal that benefits india 
whats wrong with that he would not let his name be used 
factors that encourage corruption multiplied as indias 
political system and economy developed 
for about 20 years after independence from britain in 1947 
india was virtually a oneparty state run by the congress party 
the growth of a viable opposition in the 1960s made elections more 
expensive so political bosses turned to kickbacks for money 
an expanding economy which grew an average of more than 5 
percent a year in the 1980s created more wealth and with it more 
temptation 
last year when prime minister rajiv gandhi and his congress 
party were voted out of power corruption played a major role for 
the first time in the downfall of a government 
also for the first time dirty deals have been blamed for huge 
losses in some industries 
indias fertilizer industry lost 32 million in 1989 after 
posting a 50 million profit the previous year 
the reason diplomats and indian officials say privately was 
that agriculture ministry officials wanted a 25 million kickback 
on a 500000ton purchase of phosphoric acid from moroccos 
government phosphates company 
morocco refused india canceled the contract and the fertilizer 
industry was without essential phosphoric acid the informants said 
corruption also contributes greatly to a balance of payments 
deficit that has built foreign debt of about 60 billion over the 
last 10 years diplomats and western economists say 
a report by a western embassy in january seen by the associated 
press estimated onethird of indias gross national product 
disappears into the black economy 
the sheer number of beneficiaries is seemingly endless and the 
habit and pressure so ingrained that it would require a major 
change in society as a whole to end corruption the report said 
singhs administration announced two major changes in may and 
june 
first all staterun trading firms were put under a new umbrella 
organization bharat business international which has the power to 
monitor international contracts a major source of illegal wealth 
then the government announced an industrial policy designed to 
break the bureaucratic stranglehold on business licenses the 
license raj another major channel for bribes 
diplomats and officials of the new government say international 
contracts are believed to been a major source of revenue for the 
congress party when it and gandhi were in power 
they say purchases were made abroad forinflated prices and the 
sellers kicked back most of the extra money to indian politicians 
who deposited it in party bank accounts 
preliminary charges have been filed by the central bureau of 
investigation indias version of the fbi in two cases involving 
members of the gandhi government 
it alleges bribes were paid to officials in a 147 billion 
aircraft purchase from europes airbus industrie consortium and a 
14 billion arms deal with ab bofors the swedish arms 
manufacturer 
the western and indian informants describe the reform efforts as 
too little too late 
in its reform of international purchases the singh government 
is emphasizing barter that means part of indias payment for 
purchases usually 10 to 15 percent will be in goods not 
dollars 
industrial experts say the practice will allow politicians and 
bureaucrats to continue skimming money off the top because there is 
no way to fix the value of the bartered goods 
reform of the license raj is widely expected to fail because 
the new industrial plan loosens regulations only on the business 
license bureaucrats and politicians could continue squeezing money 
from businessmen for export import and other permits 
the structure of the indian political system works against 
reform indian law limits campaign spending by a candidates for 
parliament to about 6000 but most spend 175000 according to 
indian officials and diplomats 
many believe the extra money comes from official corruption 
indias political parties get no contributions a western 
diplomat said they dont raise funds the only way they get 
money is by skimming off the top of deals 
corruption may be continuing under the singh administration 
a western intelligence report seen by the ap says politicians 
received kickbacks from tunisia on the purchase of 130000 tons of 
phosphoric acid in march the minerals and metals trading corp and 
the janata dal the main party in the governing coalition denied 
the allegations which could not be confirmed independently 
we make our purchasing decisions on merit only said sk 
agrawal chairman of the minerals and metals trading corp which 
bought the phosphoric acid 
agrawal an architect of the foreignpurchase reform plan says 
he spends much of his time trying to direct corrupt politicians 
away from minerals and metals which he took over in march 
theres a set price in commodities and everyone knows it 
worldwide he said in an interview i tell them they should 
look at industrial projects where the value is less clear and 
corruption is easier

politics and corruption go together 
in much of the third world in pakistan they are like hand and 
glove 
corruption has been brought into the open by a newly free press 
and a shift toward democracy after more than a decade of military 
rule 
accusations of questionable deals and financial wrongdoing turn 
up almost daily in newspapers at news conferences and in speeches 
prime minister benazir bhutto is not immune 
the opposition has launched a witch hunt against members of my 
government and members of my family and their behavior is nothing 
short of criminal she said in a recent interview there is a 
welllaid conspiracy to hurl one false charge after another to 
manipulate the media 
they are making baseless charges to discredit democracy we 
have three courts in our country and people may go to these courts 
if they have anything 
few pakistanis take such accusers to the courts which act 
slowly and inflict little if any punishment 
ms bhuttos husband asif ali zardari is one of the 
oppositions main targets 
i am the soft belly he said you hit me and you hit her 
zardari and ms bhutto were married in 1987 while she still led 
the opposition to gen mohammad zia ulhaq the late military 
president 
if an individual in her government is accused of being 
corrupt the prime minister can get rid of him he said if 
they say the husband of the prime minister is corrupt it echoes 
throughout the world the larger the person the louder the noise 
ms bhuttos two main rivals in parliament have filed a lawsuit 
accusing zardari of trying to take over 287 acres of islamabads 
national park to build a fivestar hotel and sports complex in the 
name of a company based in london 
one of them syedda abida hussain said the only person 
listed as its director in london is ms bhuttos cousin 
the government accuses its political opponents of obtaining 
millions of dollars worth of bank loans during the 11 years zia was 
in office then writing them off or repaying them on unusually 
favorable terms 
twenty opposition figures including leaders nawaz sharif and 
ghulam mustafa jatoi are under government investigation for 
alleged wrongdoing 
sharif chief minister of punjab province is accused of 
obtaining 90 million in loans on special terms with little 
collateral he denies it 
i offer myself to be investigated by a panel of supreme court 
judges but along with me ms bhutto and all politicians under 
suspicion should also be investigated for corruption said jatoi 
leader of combined opposition parties in the national assembly 
an alliance of 16 parties called the combined opposition 
recently issued an inchthick collection of documents intended to 
implicate ms bhuttos 18monthold government and her family in 
shady deals 
allegations range from taking over valuable land and awarding 
vast mineral concessions in sindh province her power base to 
building factories with dubious loans and obtaining financial 
interests in hotels and trade 
immediately after copies of the dossier were given to western 
diplomats and foreign journalists ms bhutto sent four cabinet 
ministers to rebut the charges 
the opposition didnt even spare bakhtawar the baby 
daughter of the prime minister said khawaja tariq rahim 
minister of parliamentary affairs and ms bhuttos political 
troubleshooter 
the opposition alleged that a wellknown family of smugglers in 
karachi gave the baby a valuable piece of property kas a gift 
a 4monthold baby is being dragged by the opposition into 
vicious propaganda rahim protested 
the opposition accuses senior ministers of selling rice abroad 
for personal profit financing a textile mill with a politically 
influenced loan and borrowing 45 million without collateral to 
build a cement factory 
faisal saleh hayat commerce minister and a close bhutto aide 
responded arent we the citizens of pakistan why shoudnt we 
invest 
when the government put forth its budget in june opposition 
members walked out of parliament because ehsanul haq piracha the 
deputy finance minister was allowed to present it 
piracha was accused of granting the license for the new stock 
exchange in islamabad to his relatives and a court ruled he 
committed a clear act of favortism and nepotism he denies 
wrongdoing and has taken the case to the supreme court 
there are reports of civilian bureaucrats making money on the 
purchase of sugar jetliners and computers the sale of old 
aircraft and contracts for construction and communications 
projects 
you name it we have it said a ranking official 
investigating corruption if the government is sincere in 
prosecuting the corrupt we can bring up so many cases it will tire 
the courts 
pakistans auditor general mojahhad uzair said in his annual 
report that irregularities bungling and fraud were rampant in the 
governments accounts 
the black money feeding pakistans parallel economy was 82 
billion rupees 4 billion in 1988 said uzair a

theres little common ground in the 
emotionpacked battle over abortion but both sides agree that a 
deeply torn supreme court is moving in the direction of abortion 
opponents 
that conclusion was reinforced last week when the court released 
decisions allowing states to make it more difficult for minor women 
to get abortions without first notifying their parents 
it was only the latest sign that another supreme court decision 
a year earlier in a case now known simply as webster had 
firmly placed abortion at the center of the nations political 
debate 
for both sides as well as the conflicted ambivalent middle 
webster was an alarm that still echoes in politics in state 
legislatures and in the court itself 
the webster decision was a wakeup call said rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo she is sponsoring a bill that would write into 
federal law the legal right to abortion that the court granted 17 
years ago in roe vs wade 
the webster decision was issued one year ago this week it 
allowed missouri to restrict the use of public money medical 
personnel and facilities in performing abortions it also upheld 
the states law requiring doctors to determine through tests 
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is viable or capable of 
living outside the womb the state makes it a crime to abort a 
viable fetus 
the effect of this 5to4 decision was to let states make 
abortions harder to obtain 
in the ensuing year political candidates have seized the issue 
or dived for cover from its exploding force state legislatures 
have moved often cautiously to exercise or test their new 
authority to restrain abortions 
polls have searched for shifting sentiment and found 
ambivalence and everyone awaits the courts next words on the 
issue 
at best we are now one court appointment away from losing roe 
vs wade at worst we are just one case away said kate 
michelman executive director of the national abortion rights 
action league 
the right to choose is going to be overturned as a 
constitutionally protected right and were going back to a time 
where we have to fight this out at every state legislative level 
and end up with a patchwork of laws she said voters are using 
the political process to protect the rights the courts will no 
longer guarantee 
some abortion opponents agree with michelmans assessment but 
theyre not sure the court is ready to take back the legal right to 
an abortion 
as time goes on were beginning to see that webster signaled 
an opportunity to whittle away at roe but i believe were probably 
one vote short of an outright reversal of roe said gary bauer a 
former reagan administration official who heads the antiabortion 
family research council 
the courts lone female justice sandra day oconnor is 
regarded as the pivotal vote she swung both ways in the minnesota 
decision last week ruling against the states law requiring that 
girls notify both parents before obtaining an abortion but 
upholding parental notification as long as girls can avoid telling 
their parents by getting a judges permission instead 
every time the court gets one of these cases roe vs wade is 
going to be at risk said james bopp jr general counsel for the 
national right to life committee 
the result has been to thrust the issue squarely back before the 
states 
virtually every state legislature has considered some kind of 
abortionlimiting bill in the year since webster but only a few 
have been enacted 
its been slower than the righttolife movement hoped for 
said bauer on the other hand we have nowhere to go but up this 
time last year we had abortion on demand in all 50 states twelve 
months later a number of states are moving toward more and more 
restrictions 
two states considered abortion restrictions last fall florida 
gov bob martinez called the states legislature into special 
session to restrict abortion and saw his bill fail 
in pennsylvania where democratic gov robert casey is strongly 
opposed to abortion legislation was enacted that prohibits 
abortions at hospitals receiving public money and imposes other 
restrictions most of the provisions have been blocked pending 
court challenges 
bills that would ban virtually all abortions were considered in 
at least 10 states idahos version was vetoed by democratic gov 
cecil andrus under great national pressure 
louisianas legislature just passed a sweeping ban but gov 
buddy roemer has promised to veto it the us territory of guam 
enacted a broad ban on abortion that has been blocked for now by 
court challenges 
other states considered an array of proposals backed by 
righttolife forces to restrict abortion michigan gov james 
blanchard vetoed a bill requiring teenagers to gain their parents 
permission before receiving an abortion south carolina gov 
carroll campbell signed a similar measure 
both sides watch each state carefully because each could become 
the test case that will make its way to the supreme court and 
trigger a ruling on whether to overturn roe vs wade 
this years elections also are being closely watched several 
contests around the country are shaping up as test cases for the 
new politics of abortion 
the webster decision energized both sides in the fight on 
abortion and emboldened supporters of abortion rights who had not 
been as well organized as the prolife movement 
naral the political arm of the prochoice movement saw its 
membership surge from 133000 to more than 750000 in the months 
after webster 
schroeder said webster removed what had been political 
insulation from the issue 
people thought they could play with the politics as the court 
was standing there as the marble defender of human rights she 
said when the marble came down they couldnt 
douglas wilder in 1989 built a groundbreaking campaign around 
support for abortion rights and was elected governor of virginia by 
framing the issue as a question of an individuals freedom to 
choose 
in another key offyear race republican rep james courter lost 
his bid to become governor of new jersey after retreating from his 
opposition to abortion 
righttolife groups blamed the two defeated candidates for 
their losses saying they failed to demonstrate strong opposition 
to abortion 
since then many candidates have reversed or shifted positions 
to support abortion rights the most dramatic example was ohios 
democratic candidate for governor state attorney general anthony 
celebrezze jr 
both sides view this years gubernatorial races as critical 
since governors have the power to veto restrictive legislation 
careful attention also is being paid to iowas senate race where 
abortionrights advocate sen thomas harkin is being challenged by 
republican rep tom tauke an abortion foe 
supporters of legalized abortion have adopted wilders strategy 
of framing the issue as a matter of who decides a womans 
reproductive rights opponents meanwhile frame the question as 
one of protecting the unborn 
the republican party which for a decade has made opposition to 
abortion a part of its platform now wrestles with whether to 
abandon that position 
republican national chairman lee atwater has said the party is a 
big tent able to accommodate all views on abortion but the 
party seems headed for a struggle over the issue at its next 
convention 
president bush has remained opposed to abortion and has vetoed 
bills passed by congress that would allow federal spending on 
abortions for poor women 
but he has kept his distance from the issue like president 
reagan before him bush has addressed antiabortion rallies by 
telephone rather than in person although they were just a few 
blocks from the white house 
while everyone is extremely happy about the vetoes we wish 
there was more leadership on the issue bauer said of bush 
for all the attention and energy spent on abortion over the past 
year polls suggest public thinking hasnt changed as much as 
conventional political wisdom 
everett c ladd director of the roper center for public opinion 
research at the university of connecticut said polling reflects 
public ambivalence majorities like the idea of individual choice 
but dont like the notion of 18 million abortions every year in 
the united states he said 
people are pulled in two different ways ladd said go 
somewhere else to reconcile it the public doesnt

the old battle cries stir no souls being 
anticommunist is anticlimactic and being antideficit is out of 
fashion and not much fun 
so whats a good old conservative to stand for now that the 
rocksolid convictions have lost their sizzle 
its a question conservatives have been asking each other and a 
question policy review magazine of the conservative heritage 
foundation asked 39 conservative leaders 
more specifically the 39 were asked to provide lists of the 10 
most important priorities for the conservative movement in the 
1990s now that the old priorities lack clout 
the question produced not much consensus but some surprises 
just the same 
some participants chose to rally yet around the strategic 
defense initiative even though nuclear exchanges between the 
superpowers arent much envisioned any longer 
they also found some common ground on the concept of giving 
people freedom to chose the school their kids can attend and on 
limiting how long politicians can stay in congress two emerging 
conservative touchstones 
sdi yes press on with star wars some of these thinkers said 
the implosion of the evil empire does make the world less 
dangerous for america but not yet riskfree argued pete dupont 
former governor of delaware and former candidate for the job george 
bush holds tomorrow a dozen nations may have icbms 
deploy sdi counselled grover norquist president of 
americans for tax reform libya iraq iran and a future soviet 
empire split in 20 parts all argue for a defense against nuclear or 
chemical weapontipped missiles 
the reduction of troops in western europe will provide ample 
funding to build a total defense against any accidental deliberate 
or terrorist assault with nuclear missiles said phyllis 
schlafly a conservative crusader from alton ill another sdi 
champion 
as for schools privatize em advised jeffrey a eisenach 
president of the washington policy group 
would educational vouchers spell the end of the public 
schools he asked only if public schools fail the market 
test 
norquist also made a case for ending the system under which 
public schools have a monopoly on educating all kids in the 
neighborhood even if a school elsewhere does a better job 
we cannot enter the 21st century with an educational system 
based on the model of soviet agriculture he said 
limit congressional terms pleaded pat robertson another 
fallen competitor for the gop presidential nomination in 1988 
americas founding fathers never envisioned the house of 
representatives as a retirement home 
liberate congress chimed in ken tomlinson former director 
of the voice of america there is hope for congressmen who say 
they cannot maintain two residences on their income limit 
congressional terms 
there were plenty of votes for continuing the reagan revolution 
by cutting taxes but not many of these conservatives spent much 
energy cursing the deficit once a conservative whipping boy 
sen jesse helms rnc was for combatting both deficit and 
taxes by going after government spending the tax burden on the 
american people is outrageous he said 
and edwin j feulner jr president of heritage rued this 
the federal government is bigger today than when ronald reagan 
took office in 1981 
cut federal taxes for the sake of children urged allan 
carlson president of the rockford institute he proposed a 1000 
tax credit per child 
all good old conservative ideas but did these conservatives 
have any fresh ideas for the 90s 
they did 
george weigel president of the ethics and public policy center 
argued for massive reconstruction now that the days of massive 
retaliation are gone 
am i the only one who thinks it a disgrace that the interstate 
highway system in beginning to look and feel like something in 
the third world he asked 
norquist had a new idea greatly increase immigration to 
america he proposed 
in nations with freemarket economies people are a resource 
not a burden he said immigrants bring life skills youth and 
a love of freedom to freedoms home america 
free hong kong proposed sen connie mack rfla mindful 
that britains island colony is to come under chinese control in 
1997 
if we allow that remarkable little territory to become captive 
to the totalitarians on the mainland without absolute guarantees of 
democracy and freedom for hong kong citizens then we will have 
failed the cause of freedom 
and lee edwards lecturer in politics at catholic university of 
america said conservatives should not let their generationslong 
fight with communism slip out of memory 
erect a victims of communism memorial on the mall he 
urged whether communism is headed for the ash heap of history or 
not conservatives must never let the world forget the human cost 
of communism the tens of millions of innocents who died as a 
result of communist tyranny

the indonesians may have a lesson to teach 
other countries rich in buried ancient art 
in those places looters often sell artifacts to private dealers 
rather than turn them over to authorities the indonesian 
authorities compete with the private collectors however rewarding 
finders generously 
now at a show opening today at the national gallery of art are 
many treasures that came to the indonesian government through its 
reward system 
one of the treasures was found in a cave on the island of java 
by a group of archaeologists helping the government survey tourist 
sites 
five hundred meters inside the cave filled with stalagmites 
and stalactites on top of a tall rock shaped like an altar they 
discovered a large bronze vessel containing several objects 
including this gold and silver statuette of a couple holding 
hands wrote jan fontein of the boston museum of fine arts who 
put the show together 
archaeologists calculate that the tiny couple less than 5 
inches high must be at least 1000 years old probably a bit 
more they still arent sure who the subjects were probably the 
hindu god shiva and his consort parvati 
both wear costumes that leave the upper part of their bodies 
bare their heads are surrounded by haloes and protected by little 
golden parasols 
the show the sculpture of indonesia will be in washington 
through nov 4 before traveling to houston new york and san 
francisco many of its best items were found by chance 
a much bigger shiva more than 42 inches high in gold bronze 
and silver with four arms and three eyes was found in 1933 by 
farmers bathing in the kali wadas river 
fontein has added up 854 separate finds some of which include 
several objects they were officially reported to dutch colonial 
authorities before indonesia became independent and since then to 
the indonesian government and other official bodies 
theres a tendency to report them because of the fair way the 
authorities reward the finders he told a news conference 
in many parts of the world finders get more by selling their 
treasures secretly than they would if they reported them to a 
museum that enrages museums and archaeologists because thieves and 
amateurs often destroy much of the evidence sometimes unwittingly 
fontein told of a boy working in an indonesian garden last year 
who found a golden neckpiece that weighed over 3 pounds he said 
the authorities paid the full market price of the gold and divided 
it between the boy and owner of the garden 
the boys education is assured he added 
fontein was allowed to see the neckpiece on condition he did not 
ask for it to be sent to the exhibition an attempt will be made to 
film it for a production linked with an 18month celebration of 
indonesian culture to open here in september 
j carter brown director of the national gallery said this 
exhibit opened before september because so many people visit 
washington in the summertime 
fontein said he did not know why so many objects were buried 
many of them close to the surface one farmer found a temple bell 
because a new kind of sugar cane required him to plow a few 
centimeters deeper near it was box with a chain from which the 
bell had been hung 
sometimes i think they buried them just for us to find he 
said 
many were buried by faithful buddhists and hindus when indonesia 
was invaded by moslems 400 years ago the moslems disapproved of 
representations of people and living things and objects connected 
with other religions 
buddhists and hindus took refuge in the hills of java the final 
object in the show is a threepanel sculpture apparently of hindu 
origin it is more than 5 feet high and 7 feet long and shows a 
scene in a blacksmiths shop on one side is the smith forging a 
sword on the other a man working a bellows to heat the forge 
in the middle is a fat man with the head of an elephant naked 
and dancing he is wearing a priests headdress and holding a small 
dog in one hand 
what is he doing there that story is lost

at lunch over memorial day weekend in 1987 
mary roy ate an orange that burned her mouth and throat and 
triggered her threeyear effort to get stores to label treated 
produce 
doctors said it was bronchitis 
i knew it was that orange said roy 58 an amherst 
composercumenvironmental activist its like when you trip on 
a banana peel thats what tripped you 
her supermarket told her the orange had been sprayed with a 
pesticide 
roy later learned that oranges and many other fruits and 
vegetables frequently are sprayed with postharvest pesticides the 
pesticides typically mixed with wax make produce look better and 
last longer 
four of the 18 most common pesticides folpet benomyl captan 
and thiophanatemethyl are considered possible or probable human 
carcinogens by the environmental protection agency the epa allows 
them to be used because it considers their benefits in preventing 
rotting or infestation to outweigh the risk of cancer agency 
spokesman al heier said 
this spring roys onewoman lobby got new hampshire to put 
teeth in its longunenforced law requiring stores to label fruit 
and vegetables that have been waxed fines are 200 for a first 
violation and 500 for subsequent ones 
you really have to push them to do this said roy who now 
eats organically grown produce the trouble is that its so 
difficult to fight the powers that be it is not popular with 
industry 
a federal law has required that waxed fruit be labeled for 
decades but it hasnt been enforced and supermarkets rarely abide 
by it 
last year maine became the first state to require postharvest 
pesticide labeling regulations still are being drawn up to enforce 
the law 
this spring new york attorney general robert abrams proposed a 
law that would go beyond maines it would require the names of 
pesticides used after harvest to be posted next to produce in 
maine stores need only a sign indicating pesticide use but are 
required to provide shoppers who ask with details within 48 hours 
a number of postharvest pesticides may have adverse health or 
environmental effects abrams said the use of these pesticides 
presents a legitimate concern to consumers who are increasingly 
demanding to know the contents of the food they purchase 
there is a safe food movement in california but no legislative 
action has resulted and consumers for safe food in illinois is 
pushing for wax labeling pesticides usually are mixed with waxes 
used to replace natural wax lost in processing they are added to 
prevent mold rot and other deterioration while the produce is 
packed shipped and sold 
according to americans for safe food fruits and vegetables that 
can be waxed are apples cucumbers bananas beets cantaloupe 
coconuts garlic grapefruit oranges lemons limes mangoes 
pumpkins eggplants papayas potatoes rutabagas squash 
tomatoes turnips watermelons nuts tangerines plantains 
peppers avocados and pineapples 
some waxes contain derivatives of animal fat a concern to 
people who follow jewish or moslem dietary laws 
in addition to labels on waxed produce federal law requires 
wholesalers to identify on shipping crates the postharvest 
pesticides used but does not require that information to be passed 
on to consumers 
waxes arent dangerous in themselves but seal in pesticides 
which can penetrate the peel into the fruit said susan cooper of 
the national coalition against misuse of pesticides 
the food and drug administration does not enforce the labeling 
law 
we have only so many resources and labeling is not a 
priority said curtis coker assistant to the director in the 
division of regulatory guidance im glad to see that the states 
have more recently taken an interest in that 
but he said a proliferation of state requirements could cause 
confusion 
those resisting labeling range from pesticide manufacturers who 
consider their ingredients trade secrets to produce growers and 
marketers who fear their produce will be stigmatized coker said 
we see it as unnecessary said jill snowden director of 
scientific affairs for the united fresh fruit and vegetable 
association which represents about 80 percent of the nations 
produce growers and distributors 
theres a certain amount of liability for the producer 
because the labels could give the products a poor image she said 
what were seeing now is regulation based on fear 
phyllis spaeth of the new york attorney generals office 
disagrees 
were not trying to scare people spaeth said the most 
important thing is that consumers should have a right to know 
whats in there 
new yorks push for labeling laws came after a survey of 
supermarket chains failed to find any properly labeled shipping 
cartons 
but snowden said detailed pesticide labeling faces great 
hurdles produce goes from farmer to packing shed where it is 
treated to wholesaler to retailer so you have no way of easily 
labeling a single item 
retailers say they can only pass on the shipping carton label 
which they have no simple way of checking 
itll be a problem naturally but were going to do what the 
law requires said angelo eliopoulos director of produce at 
market basket a 40store new england supermarket chain 
david sneddon coowner of fairway fruits and vegetables in new 
york city said putting a sign up wont be a problem but taking 
responsibility for what it says will 
were not chemists he said as long as somebody tells me 
what to write ill do it the problem is how can you guarantee 
whats on the product whos responsible 
roy meanwhile said shes waiting for new hampshire officials 
to go through the rulemaking process before signs appear in 
supermarkets she doesnt know when that will be 
but her crusade wont lead her back to mainstream grocery 
shopping i already know all i need to know she said

a majority of consumers surveyed said they 
favor labels on supermarket shelves detailing the nutritional value 
of products and would use the information to plan meals a 
nutritionist said 
nutrition shelf labeling reaches consumers in a clear and 
direct way by providing information at the point of purchase 
said claire boasi a nutrition professor in the college on nursing 
at the university of pennsylvania 
the labels used in the survey distingushed six categories low 
calorie low sodium low fat low cholesterol source of fiber and 
source of calcium 
ms boasi spoke recently at the fourth annual conference of the 
association for the study of food and society at drexel university 
the convention included nutritionists and sociologists from the 
united states europe mexico and india 
store labeling is uniform consistent standardized visible 
and accessible it is literally on the shelf she said 
fiftyfour percent of the 283 respondents said such labeling 
should be extended ms boasi said and 67 percent said they used 
the nutrition information to plan meals the study was carried out 
by leaving questionnaires in supermarkets seventyeight percent of 
the respondents were men 
ms boasi is a consultant to data documents systems a kansas 
firm specializing in food labeling the company asked the federal 
food and drug administration for permission to conduct the survey 
in 16 supermarkets in 12 states 
bill whit coorganizer of the conference and a former president 
of the association for the study of food and society was skeptical 
of how stores would react most advertising is centered around 
products based on nonnutritional characteristics he said 
ms boasi said stores would use labeling in response to consumer 
demand 
michael jacobsen executive director of the center for science 
in the public interest a nonprofit consumer advocacy group in 
washington dc said shelf labeling is a good way to get 
nutrition information to consumers 
but such labels would be easy to miss jacobsen said he noted 
there are proposals in congress that would require labels on most 
food packages

in the world series of birding people do 
the migrating 
hoping to identify as many birds as possible in 24 hours 
fiveperson teams came to new jersey for a weekend in may to cough 
like a clapper rail and squint through binoculars 
a team sponsored by carl zeiss optical in alexandria va 
captured the seventh annual birdwatching title by identifying 210 
birds after racing over 490 miles 
stop please stop please stop the van shouted julie 
zickefoose a bird illustrator from hadlyme conn theres a tern 
hovering 
the group identified the bird within 10 seconds and shouted 
drive on 
you dont have time to enjoy the bird said rick radis a 
writer from denville nj who was on the winning team it was 
theres a stilt sandpiper lets get back in the car 
sponsored by the new jersey audubon society the contest began 
at 1201 am and ended the following midnight the teams 
frantically crisscrossed hundreds of miles of new jersey from 
pinelands to shore marsh 
most started in northwestern new jersey relying on their ability 
to hear birds in the morning darkness with daylight came a 
southward migration of birdwatchers who hit the new jersey shore 
tired but eager by midday the competition ended on the tip of new 
jerseys southern shore in cape may a haven for migratory birds on 
their atlantic flyway 
the state attracts a variety of birds because of its varying 
terrain of coastline small mountains and pinelands its location 
between canada and the southern united states also makes it 
possible to find birds from those areas 
on a sunny and windy afternoon wind hampers birdcalls the 
birders descended on the edwin forsythe national wildlife 
refuge in oceanville 
the vans make their own formation by rumbling slowly along a 
dirt road until someone sights or hears a new bird species 
teams operate on the honor system and all members are required 
to have seen or heard the bird for it to be marked off five 
percent of the birds do not have to be identified by all members 
this year 253 birds were identified by the 35 teams the clapper 
rail was heard but not seen 
would a birder lie 
its the last of the honor sports said peter alden a tour 
group leader from new york city who has visited more than 100 
countries and seen more than 5000 bird species but you could 
have lied through your teeth gotten up at 11 in the morning and 
figured out what you could have seen 
alden and ms zickefooses group which also included actress 
jane alexander didnt seem like the lying kind bird 
identification books littered their van and three hours of travel 
with them showed their love for mastering the coughs that will draw 
out a clapper rail and for whipping out binoculars fast enough to 
spot a snowy egret

for example they found a red crossbill in northern new jersey 
even though the migratory bird is not usually found in the state in 
spring or summer

the implanted insulin pump may soon offer more 
independence for diabetics doctors at the american diabetes 
association convention said 
but two specialists said relief through organ transplants or an 
implanted glucose sensor that doesnt require patients to monitor 
blood sugar levels is a long way away 
dr christopher saudek an associate professor of medicine at 
johns hopkins university who has worked on implanted insulin pumps 
for a decade told about 300 association members at last months 
convention that studies on the pump have been so successful it may 
be on the market by 1993 
the pump is a disc of titanium about 3 inches thick implanted 
under the skin in the abdomen with a catheter that delivers 
insulin which is absorbed directly into the liver diabetics 
cannot produce or process insulin a hormone that acts on sugars 
and starches in the blood 
with the pump insulin is delivered at a basic rate except 
before meals when the wearer decides how much of a bonus boost to 
deliver 
in 1986 the pump was implanted in 10 people at johns hopkins 
and eight at the university of california 
the results of these trials showed they could control their 
diabetes very well saudek said they love it 
pumps have been implanted in 13 people since january and will 
be implanted at seven hospitals in the united states and three in 
france if these trials succeed saudek said he will seek food and 
drug administration approval to market the pump 
the pump will be expensive 10000 to 12000 saudek 
predicted and not without maintenance problems tissue has a 
tendency to block the catheter resulting in an operation to clear 
it in six of the 10 johns hopkins patients 
but the costs more than cover the cost of complications 
blindness amputations coronary artery disease that result from 
inability to control insulin flow he said 
saudek and dr david scharp a professor at washington 
university school of medicine in st louis said the 1990s will 
bring basic research into such advances as closedloop implants 
and isletpancreas transplants 
in the closedloop system glucose sensors would monitor blood 
sugar levels and automatically adjust insulin flow from implanted 
pumps saudek thinks it will take three to five years to develop an 
accurate sensor 
scharp is conducting studies to determine if transplanting 
islets pancreas cells that produce insulin will allow patients 
to achieve insulin independence so far two have he said 
scharp believes islets show promise for relieving diabetes 
without the longer operation and recuperation time of whole 
pancreas transplants 
but there are many questions about the procedure primarily 
rejection rates he said antirejection drugs like cyclosporin can 
suppress natural insulin productivity defeating the purpose of the 
transplant scharp said

also at the convention 
a federal researcher who set out to see what doctors know about 
diabetes and what theyre doing about it says many diabetics arent 
getting the care they need 
in a survey of more than 2000 family physicians general 
practitioners internists and pediatricians who treat diabetic 
patients 87 percent agreed with the importance of maintaining 
blood glucose levels 
more than two out of three are relying on a fairly useless 
diagnostic test and only about half are prescribing the right 
number of insulin injections said dr lois lipsett of the national 
institute of diabetic and digestive and kidney diseases 
the major problem is how to reach these people she said 
after presenting her findings people with diabetes could be and 
should be receiving better medical care 
the survey was conducted between june and december last year 
among 3481 general physicians who were not diabetes specialists 
67 percent participated 
lipsett said general physicians treat four out of five of the 
nations diabetics 
only about onethird ordered regular glycosylated hemoglobin 
tests a recommended monitoring test for diabetes and only about 
17 percent performed such tests every three months as recommended 
by the diabetes association nearly 70 percent were relying on 
urine dipstick tests to monitor their patients even though that is 
no longer regarded as appropriate by the association 
single daily insulin injections were the standard for 39 percent 
of the doctors treating diabetics ages 18 and 39 and for 51 
percent of those treating patients 40 and older the associations 
standards of care call for multiple insulin injections in most 
cases

a new computer system that lets doctors 
view a chronological sequence of electrocardiograms will help with 
the diagnosis of heart ailments researchers said 
the system has been tested for three years with several thousand 
heart patients researchers from the university of florida health 
science center and duke university medical center said last month 
the researchers say the system offers major advantages over the 
standard computer analysis of single electrocardiograms or ekgs 
in detecting changes in heart function 
an ekg is a tracing of wave forms that reflect the pattern of 
electrical impulses depicting contractions of the heart 
comparing electrocardiograms in patients is literally a must 
and this kind of system has definitely arrived said dr irene 
ferrer professor of clinical medicine at columbia university in 
new york 
tracking the progression of a heart attack is probably the most 
important clinical benefit of serial comparison said university of 
florida cardiologist lamar crevasse and computer scientist mario 
ariet 
the scientists who developed the system in conjunction with 
hewlett packard co said the computer attaches a time and date to 
each episode of unusual electrical activity in the heart 
the system can analyze in 15 seconds what it would take a 
trained physician two hours to perform with measurements comparable 
to those of the computer crevasse said 
dr joseph greenfield duke universitys chairman of medicine 
and chief of cardiology said the comparative analysis still has 
shortcomings and needs more precise data programmed into it to 
improve the accuracy of its interpretations

a specialized tiny mirror could help 
scientists play a major role in a race with the japanese to move 
onto the next plateau in computer technology researchers say 
the university of arizonas optical sciences laboratory makes 
precisely ground mirrors the size of a contact lens scientists 
hope the mirrors will aid the universitys attempt to dominate a 
100 billion market for faster more powerful electronic 
semiconductor chips which are the basic building blocks of modern 
computers and electronic devices 
by developing small mirrors to focus xrays rather than visible 
or ultraviolet light scientists hope to be able to etch a thousand 
times more circuits onto the surface of semiconductor chips than 
now possible 
such a breakthrough would usher in another revolution in speed 
and miniaturization for computers consumer electronics and 
military technology 
the whole name of the game is to cram more processing power 
onto the surface of a fingernailsized semiconductor chip said 
charles falco director of research on xray optics the 
technique that weve been using for four decades has been taken to 
its physical limits 
at present electronics engineers can place about 1 million 
circuits onto the surface of a chip falco his team and 
researchers at princeton university and bell laboratories 
partners in a joint venture hope to put 1 billion circuits on a 
chip 
to achieve the goal they must narrow stencil lines now only 1

university of florida researchers will 
help treat thousands of victims of the chernobyl nuclear disaster 
in a study that could help prepare the united states for a similar 
accident 
researchers from the universitys institute of food and 
agricultural sciences are helping ukrainian colleagues to develop a 
process for extracting pectin from sugar beets said donald price 
vice president for sponsored research 
doctors from the universitys health science center will help 
determine how much pectin is needed to rid the body of heavy metals 
left behind by the accident 
this collaboration will serve as a giant clinical study on the 
effectiveness of pectin in treating these illnesses price said 
pectin is a carbohydrate normally extracted from citrus and 
apples and used in jams jellies and candies university 
researchers patented a process last year to extract pectin from 
sugar beets which are plentiful in the soviet union price said 
thousands of soviet citizens have dangerously high levels of 
metals such as uranium in their bodies the metals were introduced 
into the air water and food chain by the april 1986 explosion at 
the chernobyl plant north of kiev said kenneth finger university 
vice presient of health affairs 
pectin attracts these metals as it travels through the 
intestinal tract and removes them from the body finger said 
doctors will work with the soviets to determine the proper dosage 
and if mixing pectin with other chemicals increases its 
effectiveness he added 
finger said damage to internal organs and respiratory problems 
are examples of damage done by radiation poisoning

aided by president bushs concession on taxes 
japanese and us negotiators appeared close to agreement today on 
measures to resolve their structural trade problems 
bush and prime minister toshiki kaifu talked on the telephone 
late wednesday about japans increased offer to boost public works 
spending a key area of disagreement japanese officials said bush 
expressed appreciation for kaifus efforts 
this represents a breakthrough said a foreign ministry 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
japanese news reports said this mornings talks had produced 
agreements on the remaining two issues japans long process for 
approving patents and how to monitor the anticipated accord 
resulting from the trade talks called the structural impediments 
initiative 
kyodo news service quoted s linn williams the deputy us 
trade representative as saying japan had agreed to reduce within 
five years the time needed to process a patent application from 
the current 37 months to 24 months 
japan broadcasting corp said the two countries also agreed to 
meet at least twice a year to monitor compliance with the accord 
a top us negotiator on wednesday used bushs announcement of 
his acceptance of the need for tax revenue increases to prod japan 
to boost its offer on public works spending 
it took more political courage to raise tax revenues that it 
would to increase public spending said the official who spoke 
on condition of anonymity the president made an important 
decision we hope our japanese friends realize that 
afterward kaifu met with finance minister ryutaro hashimoto 
japanese media reported they decided to pledge an added 9677 
billion to japans public works spending over the coming 10 years 
the new spending total of 277 trillion was still short of the 
us demand for 322 trillion and us officials refused to 
confirm japanese reports that the matter had been resolved 
an announcement was expected later in the day after kaifus 
cabinet meets to discuss the draft accord 
the linkage between us taxes and japanese public spending 
showed the interdependence of the immense us and japanese 
economies the worlds two largest 
that interdependence is at the heart of the trade talks which 
seek fundamental economy policy changes to slash japans 49 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
japan has argued that the united states must cut its budget 
deficit to reduce the trade gap the budget deficit helps stimulate 
us consumer demand which in turn increases sales of japanese 
products in the united states 
us negotiators on the other hand have argued that increased 
spending on public works in japan could reduce the trade deficit by 
boosting demand for us imports and construction services such 
spending also could soak up some of the japanese hoard of savings 
and investment funds another source of friction between the two 
countries 
the structural talks also covered such japanese issues as high 
land prices laws restricting large retail stores collusive 
practices of large business groups and pricing mechanisms 
on the us side the issues included measures to promote 
exports training of workers and competitiveness of us products 
the structural trade talks were launched last september and an 
interim report was agreed in april the current round started 
monday with the aim of producing a final report on tuesday but 
disagrements forced a twoday extension

east bloc consumers recognize a wide range of 
western brand names even though many of the products have not been 
actively marketed or may not be available in their countries a 
survey says 
the results suggest east european countries that are opening 
their borders to trade may be particularly appealing to western 
companies looking for new markets the brand management consulting 
firm that conducted the survey said 
we found an overwhelming recognition of brands in what are not 
market economies stewart owen an executive of san 
franciscobased landor associates said wednesday 
very few russsians have ever seen a honda or a toyota yet 
they seem to have a very clear image of it he said 
the report was based on interviews with 1500 consumers in the 
soviet union poland and hungary five hundred people in each 
country were given lists of 400 global brand names and asked to 
identify the ones they recognized and how they felt about them the 
interviews were conducted in april and may 
sony the japanese electronics brand scored highest on a scale 
that combined recognition and perceived quality among consumers in 
the soviet union and poland the survey said sony placed fourth in 
hungary where german automaker mercedesbenz topped the list it 
said 
ford was the lone american company to make the top 10 lists in 
all three countries fanta and pepsicola joined it among the top 
10 in the soviet union 
the survey said soviets were able to identify an average of 100 
brand names while poles were familiar with 175 and hungarians with 
about 250 the differences were attributed to the degree of 
exposure to western media 
although the numbers of familiar brands were far lower than the 
thousands american consumers can identify owen said they are 
still amazingly high considering each country has had a closed 
economy until recently 
very few of those products are for sale there very few of 
them could be afforded there and very few have ever been seen 
there he said 
it is very clear to us that people who are going to invest to 
create these brand images have a great potential there he said 
landor said the survey also turned up a disturbing 
undercurrent relating to american brands 
landor president don casey said many american brands scored much 
lower when ranked by perceived quality than on the basis of mere 
consumer recognition 
among soft drink companies for instance pepsicola ranked 
sixth and cocacola ninth in terms of recognition in poland but 
pepsi dropped to 34th and cocacola was 26th when ranked by 
perceived quality 
in hungary the differences were even more striking pepsicola 
was fourth and cocacola was fifth in terms of recognition but 
pepsi dropped to 74th and coke fell to 47th in terms of perceived 
quality 
owen said one explanation may be that luxury goods have an 
inherent advantage over soft drinks in terms of how they are 
perceived 
but casey said there was no such gap for japanese or western 
brands 
it suggests that american companies must quickly address the 
perception of their product quality in eastern europe or risk 
losing ground to european or japanese competitors he said

iraq has warned kuwait and the united arab 
emirates to curb their excess oil production and called for a sharp 
rise in world oil prices a newspaper reported 
the moves represent a challenge to saudi arabias leadership in 
setting oil policy in the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries the new york times reported in thursdays newspaper 
the warning from president saddam hussein said the two small 
persian gulf nations were harming iraqs vital interest as well as 
those of the oil cartel by exceeding their opec production quotas 
the newspaper reported 
iraq which has emerged triumphant from its war with iran has 
been trying to anoint itself as the leading military political and 
economic power in the middle east 
the warning was in a letter delivered tuesday by iraqs deputy 
prime minister saadun hamadi to the emir of kuwait sheik jaber 
alahmed alsabah the times said quoted arab oil industry sources 
hamadi also was quoted in gulf newspapers as saying that oil 
prices should rise to 25 a barrel from about 14 a barrel 
currently the newspaper said opecs official target price is 18 
a barrel 
oil industry officials estimate that kuwait and the uae are 
exceeding their production quotas by a combined total of nearly 14 
million barrels a day overall opec output recently has been about 
235 million barrels a day compared with the cartels official 
ceiling of 22 million barrels

bills giving the securities and exchange 
commission authority to curb penny stock fraud and other illegal 
activities have moved a step closer to becoming law 
the house energy and commerce committee which oversees the wall 
street regulator voted wednesday to send the penny stock reform 
act and the securities law enforcement remedies act to the full 
house for consideration 
the penny stock bill introduced just two months ago would give 
the sec power to bar crooked promoters and consultants from selling 
the highly speculative stocks that usually sell for a dollar or 
less 
rep matthew j rinaldo rnj a cosponsor of the bill noted 
that the speed with which we have moved to get the bill through 
committee underscores the depth of concern in congress about this 
problem 
penny stocks are not traded on most stock exchanges most 
information about the lowpriced and often risky securities comes 
from the brokers who sell them while not illegal penny stocks 
which typically are used to finance new or small companies are 
considered to be chancey investments at best 
the penny stock bill would allow the sec to 
close a loophole that now allows unscrupulous penny stock 
brokers to evade sec banishment from the securities business by 
calling themselves promoters or consultants whom the sec has no 
power to regulate 
tighten disclosure requirements for highly speculative 
investments known as blank checks and blind pools 
facilitate at the earliest feasible time an automated stock 
quotation system to help investors keep track of penny stocks 
nationwide 
the proposed legislation is supported by the sec the consumer 
federation of america and the north american securities 
administators association a statelevel stock regulators group 
that estimates american investors lose about 2 billion a year to 
penny stock scams 
the committee also approved the remedies act which would widen 
the secs authority to seek court orders imposing civil fines and 
barring convicted securities law violators from serving as officers 
or directors of companies whose stock is publicly traded 
an earlier version of the bill would have given the sec direct 
authority to bar miscreant officers and directors but it was 
softened at the request of sec officials who said only federal 
judges should have that authority 
the sec which now can seek fines only in illegal insider 
trading cases could ask a judge to impose fines of up to 100000 
against an individual and 500000 against a company another 
provision of the bill would give the sec power to order alleged 
wrongdoers to cease and desist illegal activities without first 
having to go to court and obtain a restraining order 
this cease and desist authority is similar to that granted the 
banking regulators in last years savings and loan legislation 
said rep edward j markey dmass a cosponsor of the bill 
the remedies bill was introduced by rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the energy and commerce committee

florida federal savings bank once among the 
countrys top providers of guaranteed student loans has been 
ordered to pay 82 million for cheating a federallybacked loan 
program 
senior us district judge ben krentzman sentenced the thrift 
wednesday to pay 6 million in restitution and an additional 22 
million in fines the judge could have imposed fines of up to 215 
million 
florida federal and two of its studentloan executives were 
convicted last month of conspiring to submit 17000 fraudulent 
claims for government reimbursement on defaulted student loans 
worth 35 million 
the thrift doctored documents to show attempts to collect the 
loans when in fact no efforts had been made the government said 
the st petersburgbased thrift received some 18 million from 
the us department of education before payments were halted 
prosecutors said it was the largest federal studentloan fraud case 
ever prosecuted 
prior to the sentencing the government had collected about 11 
million from the thrift 
two thrift executives also were sentenced wednesday 
robert o harmas 42 of noblesville ind received two years in 
prison and james j lamantia 59 of largo was sentenced to three 
years probation 
harmas a vice president and operations manager in the student 
loan department had faced as much as 240 years in prison and fines 
of more than 10 million lamantia collection manager of the 
division faced up to 165 years and 7 million 
a federal jury convicted the thrift and harmas on all 43 counts 
of fraud conspiracy and theft lamantia was found guilty on 23 of 
the counts 
florida federal was the thirdlargest provider of student loans 
in the country from november 1986 to july 1987 the period covered 
in the indictment 
at the time some 117 percent of its assets or 642 million 
were student loans the government said 
prosecutors said that instead of contacting students who failed 
to pay back their loans florida federal employees faked doing the 
work then after the falsified data was put into a students file 
the thrift submitted the information for reimbursement from the 
education department

democrats at the budget summit are responding 
to president bushs easing of his notax stance by discussing 
possible cuts in some of their favorite benefit programs including 
social security 
the closeddoor talks between leading lawmakers and white house 
officials resume today a day after the bargainers accelerated 
their pace and plunged into specific suggestions for saving 
billions of dollars next year no agreements were reached but 
participants said real work was finally being done 
whatever deadlock there was in our negotiations has 
disappeared said sen pete domenici rnm 
the talks began in midmay they had inched along until bushs 
declaration on monday that tax revenue increases along with 
spending cuts had to be a part of any deficitreduction package 
on wednesday democrats presented a menu of cuts in a wide range 
of benefit programs that one official said would save 57 billion 
and another said could produce 10 billion in savings the 
officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
democrats have long been protective of benefit programs called 
entitlements because the poor and elderly who are covered tend to 
support their party 
today we democrats are raising the whole question of 
entitlement programs said senate budget committee chairman james 
sasser dtenn thats a very sensitive area for democrats 
overall the negotiators are seeking 45 billion to 60 billion 
in savings for fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 
officials said that among the options were a threemonth delay 
in the annual costofliving increases in benefit programs for 
which people qualify automatically such as social security that 
onetime postponement from next jan 1 to april 1 would save 
the government 3 billion next year 
the proposal ran into flak from domenici and house ways and 
means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill people at the 
meeting said rostenkowski told his fellow negotiators that 
death would be the political consequence of adopting the idea 
other options discussed included 
boosting from 50 percent to 85 percent the amount of income 
subject to federal taxes earned by couples receiving social 
security and earning more than 32000 annually the increase would 
raise 31 billion for the government next year and 54 billion 
over five years 
medicare reductions 
cuts in spending on various federal employee benefit programs 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo the lead 
democratic negotiator said there was a consensus that bargainers 
should try to concoct a plan that would balance the budget by 
fiscal 1995 
that would be two years after the grammrudman law requires the 
deficit to be eliminated 
its fair to assume that the targets are going to be 
changed domenici said 
outside the bargaining room however members of both parties 
clung to partisan positions on the questions of taxes 
sen trent lott rmiss and 12 of his 44 senate gop colleagues 
signed a letter saying the deficit must be controlled through 
spending reductions and economic growth not through tax 
increases 
on tuesday 90 of the 176 house republicans signed a similar 
note

a former nissan executive was elected thursday as 
president of fuji heavy industries co giving nissan effective 
control over the slumping manufacturer of subaru cars 
fuji shareholders approved the selection of isamu kawai former 
president of nissan diesel motor co a subsidiary of nissan motor 
co during a meeting here 
nissan japans second largest automaker is fujis largest 
shareholder with a 42 percent stake and its superior in a 
corporate grouping or keiretsu japan has many such groups bound 
together by cross shareholdings other financial ties and common 
business strategies 
fuji would have been probably taken over if it were in the 
united states and im sure even nissan had difficulty deciding 
whether it should acquire it said kimihide takano an analyst 
with chemical securities co 
but he said nissan chose a typically japanese way taking 
advantage of its superior position in the group to send an 
executive to exercise effective control 
this way nissan can obtain the same economic effects as 
acquiring the whole company takano said 
he said nissan plans to use fuji facilities to expand its 
production and to obtain fujis technology in the defense and 
aerospace industry 
fuji is one of the nations largest makers of military 
aerospace and railroad equipment but such production accounted for 
only 20 percent of the companys sales last year eighty percent of 
fujis 1989 sales of 658 billion yen or 43 billion came from 
automobiles 
the 1989 sales were down 15 percent from the previous year and 
fuji ran up nearly 30 billion yen or 194 million in debt in the 
year 
meanwhile sales of nissan toyota motor corp honda motor co 
and mitsubishi motors corp were booming in japan and the united 
states 
industrial bank of japan fujis main bank and its second 
largest shareholder with a 4 percent stake is also sending one of 
its former executives to fujis management 
in a similar case sumitomo bank rescued mazda motor corp 15 
years ago when mazda was in trouble 
until about a decade ago fujis us subsidiary distributing 
fourwheeldrive models was highly profitable but its sales have 
plunged in the last few years analysts say the problem is weakness 
in its sales network 
fuji previously had no seats on the board of subaru of america 
inc because it did not fully own its us subsidiary it announced 
recently however that it had bought the rest of the shares in 
subaru of america 
to tell you the truth the situation has been very difficult 
for us said a fuji official speaking on condition that he not 
be identified 
of course there is a weird feeling among us fuji employees to 
have a president from nissan but thats the way it goes we have 
to get over this tough time he said 
mr kawai is familiar with our company and he has a 
reputation for reviving nissan diesel which was not doing very 
well before he was president but now its doing just fine he 
added 
after resigning as fujis president to take responsibility for 
its problems toshihiro tajima has taken the ceremonial position of 
chairman 
chemical securities takano said there are too many automakers 
in japan 
the latest case suggests how japanese auto industry can be 
restructured he said small comanies will disappear by being 
merged into the big ones

japanese and us negotiators today reached an 
agreement to help trim the 49 billion us trade deficit with 
japan they hailed the accord as an unprecedented step toward 
easing tensions between the two partners 
details of the accord were to be announced later but officials 
emerging from the talks in the foreign ministry said there had been 
compromises and cooperation they said there was no need to 
schedule further sessions 
there had been concern that this round in the socalled 
structural impediments initiative might have to be continued next 
week in the united states to reach agreement on a final report 
about farreaching economic policy changes 
president bush welcomed the accord and said the effects will 
be beneficial for the entire world in a written statement in 
washington bush credited the strong and courageous political 
leadership of prime minister toshiki kaifu for the progess 
achieved 
linn williams the us deputy trade representative said bush 
and kaifu had taken important steps especially bush in his 
announcement of willingness to consider tax revenue increases 
it is a remarkable thing that these two economies have done 
williams said i see this as a kind of joint leadership japan 
and the united states got together on difficult issues and worked 
together constructively we should be pleased with the efforts and 
results 
particularly prime minister kaifu and president bush can be 
proud they have done something no two other countries have done 
before he added 
bush and kaifu talked by telephone late wednesday about japans 
final increased offer to boost public works spending a key area 
of disagreement 
williams said the trade talks were an important influence on 
bushs tax move which is aimed at reducing the federal budget 
deficit the deficit is regarded as a fundamental cause of the 
trade imbalance because it fuels us demand for consumption and 
imports from japan 
raising us tax revenues may thus reduce japanese exports and 
cut the trade surplus 
bushs announcement was followed by a japanese compromise 
wednesday to increase planned public works spending that might 
help reduce the trade imbalance by increasing sales of us 
products and construction services in japan and soaking up some 
excess japanese savings and investment funds 
we have an international responsibility and we had to 
cooperate to come to a compromise a senior japanese official 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the talks had stretched from their scheduled two days to four 
before they ended late today 
after four days of looking at each others faces friendships 
tend to develop the japanese official said 
another japanese official said both countries had taken 
politically dangerous steps bush risks political strife if taxes 
are increased and the japanese worry about inflation resulting 
from boosts in public works spending 
the japanese side added 9677 billion to its offer on public 
spending boosting the total to 277 trillion over 10 years 
japanese media reported the us side had asked for 322 trillion 
for the decade 
the linkage between us taxes and japanese public spending 
showed if nothing else the interdependence of the immense us 
and japanese economies 
that interdependence was at the heart of the structural trade 
talks which also covered such japanese issues as high land prices 
laws restricting large retail stores collusive practices of large 
business groups pricing mechanisms and long delays in procesing 
patent applications 
on the us side the issues included the budget deficit 
measures to promote exports training of workers and 
competitiveness of us products 
the structural trade talks were launched in september an 
interim report was agreed upon in april and the current talks 
started monday 
some commentators regarded the talks as dangerous because 
rather than focusing on specific trade issues they gave a forum 
for each country to criticize fundamental things in the other such 
as education systems cultural business practices and savings 
habits 
if the talks had failed each side could have had good reason to 
be more angry than ever 
the more you become interdependent the more problems you will 
have foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said earlier this 
week but you will be more used to solving problems

kenneth m good wore a jogging suit the night 
he clinched one of the biggest land deals of his highflying career 
it was january 1985 and good was racing in fast times 
the savings and loan money machines were in overdrive real 
estate was hot and florida swarmed with speculators who had cash 
or knew how to get it 
good swaggered into town from denver and pledged nearly 38 
million cash for 5400 acres of spanish mossdraped woodlands north 
of tampa plans for fine homes offices and a highbrow country 
club were envisioned 
five years later the unfinished tampa palms development is 
controlled by two banks and up for sale another victim of a 
faltering real estate market good says his net worth has plummeted 
from 100 million into the red 
congressional investigators have grilled good about links to the 
failed silverado banking savings and loan association of denver 
and a scandal that has ensnared president bushs son neil 
i feel no shame the 45yearold good told the house banking 
committee recently shame implies guilt i think i was as much a 
victim of the markets as anyone else 
the saga of ken good is a microcosm of the sampl crisis risky 
ventures freespending splendor collapse 
deeply indebted to silverado and others good managed to 
convince the financially troubled owners of the tampa site that he 
was their savior 
people familiar with the negotiating session said good attended 
the final signing in a jogging suit a symbolic reflection of his 
gogo personality but ultimately he came up with less than half 
the 38 million he promised site owners agreed to let him finance 
the rest 
he then used tampa palms as collateral for loans and a 70 
million highrisk junk bond issue to finance other ventures 
including the 250 million debtfinanced takeover of gulfstream 
land amp development corp one of floridas major builders 
good looked like the best thing that ever happened to tampa 
until his mounting debts and the slowing real estate market toppled 
his empire 
what can you say its the story of the last couple years 
said james apthorp a former gulfstream executive kept on as 
consultant at tampa palms after foreclosure 
good a methodist ministers son raised in a kansas farm town 
followed prosperity around the nation with what acquaintances call 
a barnstormers zeal 
in 1969 he formed good financial corp in dallas and began 
amassing properties before a slump in the late 1970s stuck with 
dozens of sites and no buyers good dissolved the company in 1979 
and moved to denver 
it was in the shadow of the rocky mountains that good honed his 
flamboyant personality and enlarged his network of highprofile 
connections 
good helped found a homebuilding company talley corp which 
became one of denvers most successful developers he resigned as 
chairman and sold his share for an undisclosed amount in january 
1986 just before the end of denvers oil boom talley liquidated 
later that year 
meanwhile good had become a star in denvers social scene he 
tossed money to charities and sipped champagne with the citys 
elite a lavish party marked the opening of his 10 million 
mansion decorated with contemporary art and expensive furniture 
later used as collateral for real estate deals 
goods circle of influential friends included neil bush a 
silverado director years later the links between the two were 
still strong 
documents filed with the house banking committee show goods 
silverado debt was reduced by 8 million shortly after gulfstream 
agreed to invest more than 3 million in jnb exploration co an 
oil and gas partnership managed by bush 
the transaction also reduced bushs personal liability in a line 
of credit for jnb bush who appeared before the house panel in 
may denied any improprieties in the deal 
silverado seized by federal regulators in december 1988 has 
been the target of some democrats who question whether the 
administration moved too slowly against the thrift and are too 
lenient with neil bush thrift regulators have denied the 
allegations but decline to specifically discuss the case 
silverado lost an estimated 31 million on goods speculative 
investments in colorado cost of the siliverado bailout is 
estimated at 1 billion 
he has an uncanny sense of timing for business bush said of 
good two years ago bush did not return telephone calls for comment 
on this article 
good swept into tampa in late 1984 unknown but quickly crafted 
a reputation as a freewheeling visionary he billed tampa palms 
strategically located near an interstate highway as one of the 
best pieces of dirt east of the mississippi and a future 
national showplace 
his image was further enhanced by the quick acquisition of 
gulfstream based in plantation fla upping his portfolio to more 
than 30000 acres 
he poured money into tampa palms adding a fancy clubhouse and 
exquisite landscaping he staged grand news conferences each step 
of the way and cultivated the local press with personally guided 
tours of the property 
he was toasted by politicians courted by the chamber of 
commerce and revered as a deity by fellow developers a builder at 
a trade meeting where good was a guest speaker introduced him 
simply as mr god 
he wore silk suits and drove a maroon maserati weekends might 
find him flying to monte carlo or new york aboard his sixseat 
private jet on election night in 1988 good flew to houston for 
president bushs victory party 
goods own party in tampa soured with the economy tampa palms 
sales slowed business relocations fell through lenders pressed 
for payments it was dallas and denver all over again ironically 
billboards for tampa palms proclaim it only happens once 
good himself dismissed talk of his demise in one of his last 
public speeches in may 1989 good labeled the rumors cocktail 
conversation and unveiled plans for other projects 
in march a group of lenders and junkbond holders agreed to 
swap more than 200 million in debt for control of tampa palms 
other properties and gulfstream good was ousted from the company 
during negotiations the lenders forced good to stay away 
they would not even let him in the room said apthorp 
they had so lost confidence in him 
meanwhile good faced bank foreclosure on his posh tampa palms 
home averted only by a lastminute payment his denver home 
fetched 33 million at an auction last october 
good has pulled up stakes again this time to new york hes 
expressed interest in becoming a commodities broker 
reached in new york by telephone good said he now never 
comments to the press goods attorney gil thurm said he has no 
comment on his client 
i really dont know what his plans are said charles knight 
a tampa real estate appraiser and friend of goods but a man 
thats been able to do whats hes done youre not going to keep 
him down

britain on thursday said it had accepted a 
judgment by the european commission against the governments 
inclusion of sweeteners in selling the stateowned rover 
automobile group to british aerospace plc 
trade secretary nicholas ridley said although the government 
differed on some details of the ecs rulings it would support the 
ecs jurisdiction in the matter by accepting the judgment in 
general 
ridley said the department would take up its differences with 
the ec after consulting with british aerospace 
the commission ruled in brussels wednesday that the department 
of trade and industry illegally granted 444 million pounds or 77 
million in aid when it sold rover to british aerospace for 150 
million pounds or 261 million in july 1988 
the commission which seeks to enforce fair competition in the 
european community decided the sweeteners were illegal hidden 
state subsidies 
the aid consisted of delayed payment of the sale price under 
which british aerospace benefited an estimated 334 million pounds 
or 58 million and 11 million pounds or 19 million provided to 
the two companies to offset the cost of buying a small number of 
rover shares left in public hands 
the commission ordered the british government to recover 429 
million pounds or 75 million of the aid from british aerospace 
and a further 15 million pounds or 26 million from rover 
british aerospace had no immediate comment a spokeswoman said

good reason for that reluctance there is a glut of these

money that not only has crimped housing but also other small 
businesses 
superx corp a chain of 130 drug stores in four states sought 
bankruptcy protection after government regulators who seized the 
firms main lender were unwilling to renegotiate debt 
chickenchain el pollo asado was forced to liquidate after 
regulators cut off financing 
they made a bad situation a whole lot worse said ron 
paradise former president of el pollo asado all we needed was 
another 30 days to put a reorganization plan in place 
seven of arizonas 10 sampls are controlled by the federal 
government which must sell or dispose of 15 billion worth of 
assets in the state a survey by the accounting firm kenneth 
leventhal amp co found the worst shortage of credit in arizona in 
nearly two decades 
were virtually redlined in terms of new financing said 
former phoenix mayor terry goddard now a gubernatorial candidate 
but across the country in washington talk of a credit crunch is 
dismissed by alan greenspan the federal reserve chairman and the 
most powerful banker in the country 
nonetheless greenspan acknowledged to congress last month some 
lenders have tightened their practices and this cautious stance 
in the granting of credit could cumulate to threaten the economic 
expansion 
whatever its called the declining availability of credit 
doesnt seem to have drastically affected consumer spending at 
least not yet consumers account for much of the nations economic 
activity 
findings of the university of michigans respected survey 
research center for example show many consumers remain upbeat in 
their outlook 
consumers say these are good times in contrast to the 
volatile 1970s said survey director richard curtin after the 
70s slow and steady are not viewed as negatively as what they 
might have been 
but viewed another way curtins survey barely gets 50 percent 
of consumers polled to say these are good times another prominent 
consumer survey produced by the conference board a new york 
business research group shows consumer confidence dropped 
significantly in june the first serious decline this year 
for those who like to categorize things as boom or bust this 
is difficult because its neither curtin said one of the 
reasons its not a severe bust is because we didnt go into an 
excessive boom 
confident consumers have kept up their spending ways even as 
their personal debt load has increased eggert said thats one 
reason the economy shows signs of strength 
were avoiding a recession by spending eggert said one 
of the reasons for our prosperity is that all three groups 
government consumers and business are still borrowing 
to some economists whether the economy is truly in a recession 
boils down to a question of words definitions and interpretations 
we are limping along and thats different than being 
crippled said brusca it really is a game of semantics but to 
some being in a little bit of a recession is like being a little 
bit pregnant

a contract to oversee the neardoubling of 
saudi arabias oil production capacity is the biggest project for 
engineering and construction giant fluor corp in a decade 
officials at the irvinebased company and saudi arabias 
stateowned aramco put no exact value on the contract awarded 
wednesday 
published reports quoted industry analysts saying the contract 
could be worth 2 billion to 5 billion 
but fluor said thursday the reports could be misleading it said 
in a news release that the program still is being defined and work 
will be released in phases over five years 
certainly this is the most significant contract we have 
received in more than a decade said les mccraw fluors vice 
chairman and chief executive 
but mccraw added while we are extremely pleased to be a part 
of saudi aramcos comprehensive expansion program its premature to 
speculate on its ultimate value to fluor and its shareholders

reform agreement with japan as an important framework for 
reducing the 49 billion us trade deficit with tokyo 
the president said he welcomed the joint report thursday by us 
and japanese negotiators in tokyo in it the two countries 
identified internal economic practices that hinder open trade took 
corrective actions and made commitments to take further steps to 
resolve a wide range of structural problems bush said in a 
written statement 
we expect that the structural policy actions to be taken will 
have a positive effect on our economies encouraging open and 
competitive markets promoting sustained world economic growth 
contributing to a reduction in global payments imbalance and 
enhancing the quality of life in both japan and the united 
states he said 
further the president said in the statement the usjapan 
agreement will benefit the entire world 
bush was expected to discuss the matter further on saturday when 
he meets with japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu in houston

nations 
the agreement thursday emerged from a series of complex 
negotiations called the structural impediments initiative or sii

week that new taxes may be needed to reduce the us federal 
deficit a key factor in getting the agreement officials said 
the announcement that the president would consider such taxes

the declining presence of coffee in american 
diets has marketers scrambling for ways to attract younger drinkers 
and to expand in overseas markets 
the impact of the decadeslong slide in us coffee drinking was 
highlighted wednesday when maxwell house announced plans to close a 
50yearold coffee roasting and grinding plant in hoboken nj 
the company a division of philip morris cos kraftgeneral 
foods international blamed declining consumption for the move 
americans drank an average of 175 cups of coffee per person 
last year down from a peak in 1962 of 312 cups per day according 
to the londonbased international coffee organization the 
organization represents coffeeproducing countries such as brazil 
and colombia 
people are moving from hot acrid drinks to sweet cold 
drinks i think they will continue to do so because of our 
lifestyle people dont want to sit around blowing on coffee or 
tea said jack maxwell an industry analyst for wheat first 
securities inc 
in 1962 nearly 75 percent of americans drank coffee regularly 
according to the coffee producers group by 1988 the percentage 
was 525 percent and the fraction of people aged 20 to 29 who 
drink coffee fell from 80 percent in 1962 to 35 percent last year 
i think it really has more to do with the quality of the 
coffee which has not been as high in the last 20 years said 
steven gregg marketing director for the organizations coffee 
development group and its an image problem coffee has not been 
marketed to younger people as soft drinks have 
the collapse last july of an international coffeeprice treaty 
briefly slowed the decline in consumption said celeste georgakis 
a commodities analyst for cargill investor services inc the 
futures market price fell at that point from 120 a pound to 68 
cents although it since has rebounded to the 86cent range 
even that did not stimulate consumption because the younger 
generation has turned to soft drinks ms georgakis said 
soft drink makers have been working to exploit declining 
interest in coffee by trying to win a place on breakfast tables 
pepsicola co last year began test marketing in waterloo iowa 
for pepsi am which has more caffeine than regular pepsi but less 
than coffee 
am has been going well pepsi spokesman tod mackenzie 
said although he said the company hasnt decided whether to market 
the product nationwide he also said the company was testing 
advertising that pitches regular pepsi as a morning drink in fort 
wayne ind 
for several years market leader cocacola co has provided its 
bottlers with advertising for use at their discretion that promotes 
cocacola in the morning 
gregg said his group is trying to attract younger drinkers by 
promoting flavored coffees and unusual blends 
over the last five years growth rates for specialty coffees 
are estimated at 15 to 25 percent a year gregg said were 
particularly doing a lot with iced coffee were seeing a lot of 
success with local entrepreneurs and some of the larger companies 
getting into iced coffee products 
overseas where the coffee market still is growing maxwell 
house is introducing new instant coffees in europe and has formed 
joint ventures with japanese and korean food companies maxwell 
house spokesman richard collins said 
in china we have a small business a few months ago we 
introduced 100 percent colombian coffee collins said 
philip morris also has agreed to buy the swiss company jacobs 
suchard the worlds thirdlargest chocolate and coffee group for 
38 billion 
among the largest coffee marketers philip morris whose brands 
include yuban master blend and sanka as well as maxwell house is 
tied for leadership of the market with procter amp gamble cos 
folgers brand 
wheat firsts maxwell estimates each held about a 32 percent 
share of the 39 billion us coffee market last year 
nestle held a 135 percent share of the market with its hills 
brothers and chase amp sanborn brands according to maxwell all 
other makers including chock full o nuts and butternut totalled 
222 percent of the market 
i think the big guys are going to continue to do well there 
are a lot of others who are disappearing and they are a large 
percentage of the total maxwell said

richard lyon and his son tried to make a living 
with a twotruck shipping company but bills outran them the 
business shut down and lyon drove straight into bankruptcy court 
dont tell him the economys not in a recession 
were just one of the statistics now lyon shrugged 
ra ballard went from building 78 homes a year here in 1986 to 
six this year the three savings and loans that financed him each 
were declared insolvent and seized by federal regulators hes 
found it difficult to borrow more money 
i have essentially closed my company down said ballard a 
director of the national association of home builders i thought 
it was only happening to me i thought it was isolated to texas 
arizona and some other problem areas but its not its happening 
everywhere 
a recession not based on officially sanctioned economic 
statistics they show the us economy continues to eke out slow 
growth prolonging the longest peacetime expansion in history 
but in some regions such as the northeast and parts of the 
sunbelt local economies have slipped dramatically in some 
industries most notably housing a recession is clearly underway 
many economists say 
for millions of americans from clerks in debtladen retail 
stores to defense industry machinists facing unemployment and 
truckers and builders like lyon and ballard the times feel like a 
recession an unofficial recession 
official proclamations aside i think for certain sectors and 
certain states it is a recession said robert brusca chief 
financial economist at nikko securities co international in new 
york 
this is not a typical business cycle recession but the 
regional problems may finally drag down the rest of the country 
said albert sindlinger a forecaster whose wallingford pa firm 
tracks household liquidity as a measure of the economys health 
sindlingers survey predicted the last two recessions when it 
found more than 50 percent of us households responded negatively 
to at least one of his key questions dealing with household income 
jobs and business conditions 
that happened again for the first time in january 
historically every time that weve had the nation with over 
50 percent of the population in recession that was the month that 
the government later issued a declaration saying that was when the 
recession started sindlinger said 
consider 
the labor department reported no job growth in the private 
sector during march april and may 
an official forecasting gauge called the index of leading 
economic indicators has remained sluggish this year the gross 
national product the broadest official measure of economic 
activity has been growing at less than a 2 percent annual rate 
since october one of the slowest periods since the 1982 recession 
new home sales have fallen for six months also to the lowest 
level since the recession year 1982 the auto industry is stalled 
and defense contractors are laying off thousands 
bankruptcies are growing they range from the huge corporate 
variety resulting from junkbond debt like that of federated 
department stores to the personal variety resulting from 
unemployment or too many bills 
the latest report on regional economies by the federal 
reserve the nations central bank said most are weak or growing 
only slowly 
still the feds periodic assessment released late last month 
found healthy economies in the northern midwest and the pacific 
coast states 
moreover economists say key ingredients are missing to lay the 
groundwork for a recession most notably the high inflation that 
causes interest rates to jump sharply and bring business to a halt 
they also say the economy today is far more diversified than in the 
past 
if the economy was still as heavily dependent on housing and 
autos as it was in the 60s and 70s then id say were in a 
recession but its not said prudentialbache securities inc 
economist edward yardeni who coined the term rolling recession 
to describe the regional downturns that have swept across the 
country in recent years 
i would still characterize it as a rolling recession 
yardeni said if you want to find recession you can find it but 
its not economywide 
the national association of business economists still predicts 
the economy will skirt a recession through 1991 economist robert 
j eggert whose sedona ariz firm compiles the blue chip 
consensus forecasting report agrees 
i feel very strongly that we will not have a recession as a 
nation this year or next said eggert on the other hand he 
said recessionlike conditions are likely to prevail in some 
industries and regions of the nation its going to seem like a 
recession to some people 
it seems that way in kevin obriens business which grew by a 
record 18 percent last year and this year is up 24 percent over 
that pace customers line up before opening and use a nightdrop 
slot long past closing the number of employees has nearly tripled 
in four years 
obriens shop isnt the hippest hightech firm or video store 
hes the clerk for the us bankruptcy court in phoenix now one of 
the busiest in the nation 
by the looks of the rows of people poring over stacks of 
bankruptcy documents you might say the local economy was in a 
recession 
but like the rest of the nation arizonas economy is growing 
sluggishly a few office buildings are still under construction in 
phoenix state unemployment is running around 53 percent about 
the national average 
it is a very soft economy here said ron simon economist 
with the arizona department of economic security within arizona 
you could say that construction and related industries are in a 
recession but overall we are still growing as a state so we are 
not in a recession as a state but its fragile

eastman kodak co would consider selling 
off assets if it is fined more than 2 billion for infringing on 
polaroid corps instant camera patents chairman kay r whitmore 
said in an interview with barrons magazine 
polaroid has asked for 14 billion in damages while attorneys 
for kodak suggested the amount should be 187 millin plus interest 
industry analysts say a realistic amount would be somewhere between 
1 billion and 2 billion 
whitmore said that he has received no indication when judge 
david mazzone of the us district court in boston will decide on a 
damage figure the case has dragged on since 1986 when kodak was 
barred from making or selling the instant cameras it had introduced 
a decade earlier 
whitmore said in the june 25 edition of barrons the business 
weekly that sterling drug the pharmaceutical company purchased by 
kodak in 1988 would be a possible sale target if the award is more 
than 2 billion 
i have to recognize that there is a scenario where we wont 
have a choice where i would have to sell something to raise the 
cash whitmore said which one well the most obvious one the 
one we just bought is sterling we could get more for that today 
than the 51 billion we paid 
whitmore said kodak would fight an award it considers too large 
i can tell you if we think the award is excessive we will 
appeal he said it could all drag on a while yet 
despite the looming damage award barrons expressed confidence 
that costcutting measures will boost kodak earnings this year 
film price increases will firm up film margins and new camera and 
film technology will bolster the companys market share

manufacturers hanover corp said thursday it 
will take an unspecified onetime charge in the second quarter 
related to a restructuring that analysts say may result in the loss 
of more than 1000 jobs 
the charge which did not surprise analysts stems from the 
banks efforts to reduce expenses according to a preliminary 
prospectus covering an offering of manufacturers hanover preferred 
stock 
bank spokesman john meyers had no comment as to whether there 
would be layoffs 
but several analysts estimate manufacturers hanover the 
nations eighthlargest banking concern is attempting to slash 
100 million in annual expenses to do so they say more than 
1000 jobs may have to be eliminated 
somehow all new york money center banks have got to get their 
costs down said mara hilderman a senior analyst with moodys 
investor service there is a problem with core profitability that 
has to be improved she said 
cutting costs appears to be easier than trying to generate 
income by increasing fees and other banks have taken the same 
route earlier this month chase manhattan corp for example 
unveiled a plan to cut 300 million in expenses a move analysts 
said could result in the elimination of 3200 jobs 
manufacturers hanover would not specify how large its charge 
might be but the prospectus said the bank expects it to be less 
than operating earnings for the quarter 
in the regulatory filing the bank said only that operating 
earnings for the quarter ending saturday would be below the 96 
million in operating earnings reported during the years first 
quarter 
there was very little surprise with the news said judah s 
kruashaar senior banking analyst at merrill lynch amp co 
he predicted the charge would total about 50 million it 
wont create a quarterly loss and very importantly it will set the 
stage for the company to move ahead on impelementation this year 
of its restructuring plan he said 
kruashaar also said expenses on a quarterly basis should move 
lower in the final two quarters of this year 
manufacturers hanover traditionally releases its secondquarter 
earnings report in late july coinciding with a regularly scheduled 
board of directors meeting but full details of the restructuring 
plan might not be outlined until fall industry watchers say 
manufacturers hanover in may announced a major realignment of 
its wholesale bank business that split its operations into four 
groups eliminating a layer of management the move is expected to 
result in significant annual savings in the future the bank 
said 
manufacturers hanover stock slipped 25 cents to close at 3450 
a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
separately the bank said it expects its nonperforming assets 
to increase by 15 percent in the near future principally as a 
result of problems being experienced by one of the corporations 
major real estate customers 
that customer is developer donald trump who missed a 30

t boone pickens jr failed again thursday to 
breach what he calls the closed japanese business system 
but his efforts to gain a greater say in management of koito 
manufacturing co of which he owns 26 percent have highlighted 
the differences in how japanese and american businesses operate 
the battle also has begun to stimulate debate in japan over the 
pros and cons of japans successful but insular business culture 
the texan oilman has for the last year been demanding among 
other things four seats on the 20member board of directors of the 
auto parts maker 
at a koito shareholders meeting thursday pickens lost on that 
point and on other proposals including higher dividends and having 
shareholders vote on salary and retirement benefits of board 
members 
koito has said it could not accept on its board someone it 
believed to be interested only in forcing the company to buy back 
his stock at premium prices in order to keep control 
reacting to raucous behavior by japanese racketeers and what he 
claimed was deliberate discrimination against americans by koito 
pickens stormed out of the threehour meeting shortly before it 
ended 
it was a sham an absolute farce here today koito completely 
showed the world what its all about in corporate japan he told 
reporters 
the sokaiya racketeers were incidental to pickens battle 
they plague many companies shareholders meetings buying a few 
shares to gain entry and seeking hush money to allow the meetings 
to proceed undisturbed 
behind koitos resistance to pickens lies stiff japanese 
corporate opposition to the strong investor control practiced in 
the united states and symbolized by him japanese companies 
frequently attempt to weaken shareholder control by transferring 
much of their shares to docile shareholders who promise not to 
trade them 
they also have been able to keep shareholders happy despite 
low dividends with rising stock prices that make possible large 
capital gains 
pickens also attacked japans entrenched keiretsu system in 
which companies have formed closed links through shared stock 
financial and personnel links and corporate strategies 
he said koito in its link to toyota motor co had its profits 
squeezed by the automobile giant toyota owns nearly 20 percent of 
its stock and buys 45 percent of its output 
but koito officials denied that toyota had any control over 
koito activities they said its large share of purchases from the 
koito reflected toyotas overall strength in the japanese market 
pickens failure in his efforts to reduce the companys 
dependence on toyota and increase stockholders rights came as the 
united states and japan were working out a final agreement on 
reforming business practices seen as contributing to the large us 
trade deficit with japan 
their talks begun in september 1989 represent a recognition 
that the two sides highly divergent business cultures influence 
the sales of goods and services between them 
one of japans pledges was to curb exclusionary practices by 
keiretsu groups 
japanese press reports and comments on the koitopickens 
controversy suggest that some japanese are beginning to rethink the 
benefits of their exclusive system 
news station a popular evening news program suggested 
wednesday that although pickens motives for seeking to influence 
koito were unclear he clearly demonstrated the exclusivity of 
japanese companies 
an editorial in the prestigious economic journal nihon keizai 
shimbun said earlier it is a very typically japanese phenomenon 
for a company to treat unfavored shareholders coldly if we simply 
say when in rome do as the romans do there will arise nothing 
but friction the koitoboone issue indicates a need to reconsider 
the customs and practices of our corporate society

american telephone and telegraph co said 
thursday it will reduce its evening interstate longdistance rates 
by about 5 percent and daytime rates by about a halfpercent on 
july 1 as part of a 300 million overall price cut 
the company also will reduce the prices of operatorassisted 
calls uscanada calls and its reach out america optional 
longdistance calling plan 
overall interstate calling rates will go down an average 22 
percent atampt spokesman herb linnen said 
the cost of a 10minute directdial evening call anywhere in the 
country will drop to 149 from 158 
the cuts require approval by the federal communications 
commission 
the fcc last week ordered the nations local telephone companies 
to reduce by 11 billion effective july 1 what they charge 
longdistance companies to connect with local phone networks 
longdistance carriers typically pass along to their customers 
savings from these reduced access charges 
other phone companies such as mci and us sprint usually follow 
suit to remain competitive 
atampt the nations largest longdistance company had announced 
last month it would cut its rates by 160 million annually based 
upon earlier requests that local phone companies had made with the 
fcc 
the local companies in april had asked to reduce their access 
charges by just 405 million on july 1 but the fcc last week 
increased that amount to the 11 billion figure 
before july 1989 when atampts earnings were restricted to about 
a 12 percent rate of return on its investments the company passed 
on to its customers nearly all the savings whenever local phone 
companies reduced their access charges 
but atampt now is under a regulatory scheme that controls its 
prices within a prescribed range of caps tied to the rate of 
inflation not its profits last november atampt raised prices for 
night and weekend calling by 13 percent 
atampts residential and small business prices currently are right 
at the cap so the july 1 reductions were needed linnen said 
large business prices are well below the caps he said 
atampt said that on july 1 it will cut prices for 
directdial interstate calls between 5 pm and 11 pm sunday 
through friday by an average 5 percent 
daytime 8 am to 5 pm directdial calls by an average 05 
percent 
reach out america evening discount plan from 815 to 780 per 
hour a month and reach out halfhour plan to 4 to 435 
perminute operatorassisted calls an average 3 percent 
the first minute of canadian calls at all times 
the company said it would eliminate the one free call now 
allowed to interstate directory service meaning all such calls 
will cost 60 cents each 
atampts prices have dropped nearly 43 percent since the 1984 of 
the old bell system primarily because of fccordered reductions in 
access charges

toyota motor corp said thursday it plans to buy 
about 76 million worth of semiconductor components made by us 
manufacturers over the next three years 
the japanese carmaker also said it selected five us 
semiconductor manufacturers to make custom electronics components 
for toyota vehicles toyota said the agreements are part of its 
drive to increase the amount of us electronics it uses 
the five companies are intel corp international rectifier 
corp motorola inc national semiconductor corp and texas 
instruments inc 
toyota officials announced the agreements in new york and 
washington after completing their second mission to the united 
states in search of electronics suppliers 
the five companies will work with toyota to develop 23 types of 
electronic components including custom computer chips that control 
automobile suspension systems engines instruments and stereo 
systems the agreements could result in more than 17 million worth 
of sales over a threeyear period beginning april 1 1991 toyota 
said 
hiroshi arai general manager of toyotas electronics 
engineering division said the company began to buy us 
semiconductors last year those sales were of offtheshelf 
semiconductor products as opposed to the custom chips envisioned 
under the new agreements 
we would like to begin on a small scale and build up to a big 
business he told reporters speaking through a translator our 
impression is that we have been able to develop very good teamwork 
with the us semiconductor manufacturers 
about half of the types of custom components to be purchased 
from the five us companies would cost slightly less if they were 
obtained from japanese suppliers arai said he encouraged us 
chip makers to improve their manufacturing efficiency to cut costs 
toyota would not say how much it intended to spend on each 
companys products 
james edson a motorola marketing official said the new 
agreements represent an advancement over last years pacts which 
included purchases from motorola because the components to be 
purchased are more sophisticated 
the components motorola will supply will be made throughout the 
world including japan edson said motorola based in schaumburg 
ill is the worlds largest supplier of semiconductors for 
automotive use 
though he praised motorolas relationship with toyota edson 
said toyota is not motorolas largest customer among japanese 
carmakers he said he could not reveal the other company 
millard phelps a technology analyst at the san francisco 
brokerage hambrecht amp quist inc said the automobile industry 
represents an important market for us electronics companies 
although automotive uses account for less than 10 percent of 
us semiconductor production the percentage is growing rapidly as 
automobile control devices become more sophisticated he said

copper futures prices rose sharply thursday on new yorks 
commodity exchange amid speculation of a strike at an arizona 
copper mine and supply disruptions from zambia the worlds 
sixthlargest copper producer 
on other commodity markets precious metals orange juice and 
energy futures advanced grains and soybeans were mixed and 
livestock and meat futures were mixed 
copper futures settled 31 cents to 5 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july up 43 cents at 1143 a pound 
analysts said most of the buying was caused by the threat of a 
strike at asarco incs ray copper mine which produces 115000 
tons of copper concentrate per year 
workers have set a strike deadline of midnight saturday and 
analysts saw little hope for a new contract agreement before then 
the mines production is substantial but the market is in a 
period of seasonally slow demand and could weather a strike of two 
or three weeks comfortably said james steel a metals analyst with 
refco inc in new york 
it wouldnt matter but thats not the way the market 
reacted he said 
copper prices also were supported by continuing unrest in 
zambia where about two dozen people have died this week in riots 
sparked by the governments abolition of food subsidies 
the disturbances have not occurred in zambias two major 
coppermining areas but there is speculation the rioting might 
spread steel said 
in precious metals trading on the commodity exchange gold 
futures settled 70 cents to 80 cents higher with august at 35410 
a troy ounce silver was 12 cents to 18 cents higher with july at 
4813 a troy ounce 
orange juice futures surged on the new york cotton exchange as 
the market continued recovering from last weeks technically 
inspired collapse thursdays rally accelerated after the july 
contract surpassed 185 a pound the price level that some 
analysts had cited as the trigger for the recent sharp decline 
frozen concentrated orange juice settled 195 cents to 57 cents 
higher with july at 1879 a pound 
energy futures finished sharply higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange after the oil market snapped out of its recent 
slump 
a rumor early in the session of israeli military action against 
libya sparked a rally the buying waned after the rumor was 
dispelled but fresh news of efforts by the organization of 
petroleum to prop up world oil prices renewed the rally 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents lower to 47 
cents higher with august at 1715 a barrel heating oil was 85 
cent to 11 cents higher with july at 4903 cents a gallon 
unleaded gasoline was 50 cent to 144 cents higher with july at 
6093 cents a gallon 
corn futures rose strongly on the chicago board of trade ahead 
of two agriculture department reports wheat futures closed 
moderately lower while soybeans ended narrowly mixed 
the usdas quarterly grain stocks report contained no surprises 
but a report on spring planting intentions showed that farmers 
surveyed during the first two weeks of june planned to plant more 
corn and less soybeans than traders had expected 
corn came in at 746 million acres compared to market 
expectations of 739 million soybean plantings were projected at 
about 581 million acres compared with an expected 596 million 
some analysts pronounced the corn number bearish and the bean 
number bullish 
but what will really determine the size of the crop is the 
weather over the next 60 to 90 days said gerald zusel manager 
of balfour maclaine corps floor operations at the exchange 
a national weather service 90day forecast released after the 
close predicted abovenormal temperatures and normal rainfall for 
midwestern corn and soybean areas 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 3 cents lower with july at 
330 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 8 cents higher with july at 
295 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher with july

the governments top securities regulator 
thursday defended a study of last octobers stock market slide 
against a bitter critique by the rival commodity futures trading 
commission 
we stand by our report and every word in it securities and 
exchange commission chairman richard c breeden told a small group 
of reporters in his office 
breeden said the cftcs study of the 1989 market minicrash had 
serious methodological defects he likened the report to saying 
except for the period of time between 7 am and noon pearl 
harbor day was a good day 
breedens sharp comments came in response to a published report 
of the critique by cftc chairman wendy gramm 
in a letter to the chairman of a house subcommittee that 
oversees the cftc ms gramm called the sec study misleading 
imprecise and contradictory 
the sec regulates stocks bonds and the exchanges that trade 
them the cftc oversees the futures markets the two have been 
locked in a war of words over which agency has jurisdiction over 
financial products that share aspects of both securities and 
futures contracts 
both regulatory agencies studied causes of the 190point drop in 
the dow jones industrial average last oct 13 which occurred 
shortly after ual corp announced that a leveraged buyout had 
fallen through 
the cftc concluded last month that index arbitrage a 
computerized program trading strategy blamed by many for 
exacerbating the 1987 stock market crash was not a major factor 
in the 1989 stock slide it also found no evidence of manipulation 
in the stockindex futures market 
the bush administration is pushing legislation that would hand 
over authority over stockindex futures to the sec from the cftc 
stockindex futures often used in program trading strategies by 
large institutional investors such as pension funds allow 
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without 
having to buy the underlying stocks 
program traders try to take advantage of small price differences 
between the stock and futures markets by simultaneously buying 
large orders in one market while selling in the other the sec and 
other opponents claim it causes wild price swings 
the sec study also released last month found that index 
arbitrage and other program trading strategies accelerated the 69 
percent market drop and accounted for an unusually high percentage 
of share volume during the 90minute slide 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the panel that oversees 
the cftc asked gramm to explain the discrepancies between the sec 
and cftc reports 
in a ninepage letter to english gramm said the reports agree 
on most of the facts but she accused the sec of selectively 
omitting critical data the most obvious case is their emphasis 
on sell volume and only perfunctory mention of contemporaneous buy 
volume by the same trader groups she said 
not so breeden said 
our report looks at trading from the moment in time in which 
the ual announcement was made until the end of the day he said 
we look at the level of index arbitrage activity and the pattern 
of net activities buying and selling 
the cftc report chose to analyze the level of index arbitrage 
averaged over the entire day thats a little bit like saying that 
except for the period of time between 7 am and noon pear harbor 
day was a good day and on average there werent many problems 
there was a specific event it began at a specific point in 
time and to try and disguise the developments that occurred during 
that period of time by averaging them in over a period of time that 
is totally irrelevant demonstrates the significant methodological 
defects of the cftc report he said

rumors had flown for weeks that time warner would decide against 
making the loan 
in the two years kerkorian has had mgmua on the auction block 
nearly every big entertainment and media company has examined its 
assets australias qintex group agreed to buy mgmua for 15 
billion last year but was unable to arrange financing media mogul 
rupert murdoch who had offered 14 billion declined to reenter 
the bidding 
the time warner loan had been a centerpiece of pathes original 
12 billion 20pershare offer for mgmua time warner was to 
have gotten a lien on the united artists library as security plus 
distribution rights to the library and future pathe and mgm movies 
but pathes chief italian financier giancarlo parretti and 
kerkorian negotiated a new deal last week the new deal was crafted 
when parretti was unable to meet a saturday deadline for arranging 
the rest of the financing to time warners satisfaction the new 
deal raised the offer by 100 million to 13 billion 
time warner had insisted that pathe put at least 450 million in 
equity into the deal plus 150 million in equity from outside 
sources pathe instead proposed to raise funds primarily by 
borrowing money from european affiliates although it said it 
intended to convert that debt to equity by issuing stock to the 
affiliates 
the new buyout bid which was finalized thursday structured the 
deal as a merger rather than a tender offer and made no mention of 
time warner 
pathe intends to continue a dialogue with time warner pathe 
said in a brief statement it added pathe will seek alternative 
sources of financing to conclude its acquisition of mgmua 
mgmua spokesman scott tagliarino said mgmua would have no 
comment on the latest announcement he noted that so far pathe has 
made all its goodfaith payments 
kerkorian already had surrendered most of the control over his 
studio to qintex when that deal fell apart over a 50 million down 
payment determined not to be burned again he has made his 
agreements with parretti contingent upon a series of monthly 50 
million payments of which parretti has made four beginning in 
march 
another 53 million is due this month it and the 200 million 
in previous down payments will be distributed to mgmua 
stockholders as a 4pershare payment 
parretti has agreed to make additional 50 million payments in 
august and september and come up with the balance of the money by 
oct 23 
investors have been skeptical about the chances of the deal 
going through at its current level of 2150 per share mgmua 
stock closed thursday at 1787 up 12 cents per share on the 
new york stock exchange before pathe announced its negotiations 
with time warner had stalled
