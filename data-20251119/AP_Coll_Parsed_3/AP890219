rafik helou a retired schoolteacher 
hasnt received his state pension for nearly five months thats 
because hes a christian and lives in east beirut and the social 
security office is in west beirut the moslem sector 
he is a victim of a bizarre political crisis in longsuffering 
lebanon in which government institutions including the army have 
been split in two by rival christian and moslem cabinets vying for 
power 
the 64yearold helou who has a heart ailment has to rely on 
his sons to pay for medicines for himself and his wife who suffers 
from diabetes 
the power struggle threatens to cement the de facto partition of 
lebanon 
many of the countrys estimated 4 million people hardened by 14 
years of civil war have taken this bureaucratic nightmare in their 
stride despite three weeks of bloody fighting between rival shiite 
moslem factions in southern lebanon 
but for thousands of people like helou it has made the daily 
struggle for survival even more difficult 
state employees are still getting paid 
lebanon still has gold reserves worth an estimated 25 billion 
stored at fort knox in kentucky but with foreign currency earnings 
dwindling the central bank has turned to internal borrowing from 
commercial banks to supplement funds officials are able to collect 
in taxes customs duties and other levies 
but pensioners like helou have suffered the social security 
departments board of directors has not been able to meet to endorse 
pension payments because christian officials are afraid to cross the 
dividing green line into west beirut 
helou said in an interview we need 30000 lebanese pounds 
60 a month for medicines i relied on my annual pension of 6 
million pounds 12000 but with two governments i cant get it 
fortunately my sons are providing me with the medications for 
the time being but how long can this go on 
the crisis began sept 22 when president amin gemayels 6year 
term ended without a successor being named 
minutes before he stepped down gemayel named the commander of 
the christian army gen michel aoun as the head of an interim 
military cabinet until a new president was elected 
acting prime minister salim hoss a syrianbacked sunni moslem 
and other moslem leaders refused to acknowledge aoun 
the government lost its authority long ago and real political 
power has rested with the heavily armed militias on both sides and 
their foreign allies such as syria and israel 
yet government departments handling social and economic matters 
continued to function after a fashion just enough to maintain a 
semblance of normality now even that slender thread is in jeopardy 
ghassan bitar a christian municipal employee said he and his 
colleagues have not been paid since september 
bitar 32 who has two children and a wife five months pregnant 
said he had to turn his family mercedesbenz into a taxi to make 
ends meet 
i cant leave my family hungry he said 
rana shehabs dreams of going to london to study medicine were 
shatted ms shehab an 
18yearold moslem the only alternative was to enroll in the 
american university of beirut 
the university which once was the most prestigious education 
center in the middle east is now a shadow of that since its foreign 
professors were frightened off by a wave of kidnappings of its 
american and british lecturers and administrators 
but ms shehab noted its better than nothing 
an education ministry official sami hamadi said the authorities 
decided not to issue certificates for students in either west or 
east beirut until the government is reunited 
even getting in and out of lebanon has become a problem for some 
people 
airport officials turned me back when they saw my passport was 
renewed in east beirut said anis saeed a christian when he 
tried to leave through the airport in west beirut 
i got my ticket refunded and now im going to take the ferry to 
cyprus from the christian port of jounieh said saeed 24 
the lebanese have learned how to survive under the most arduous 
conditions during the civil war israels invasion in 1982 and 
endless factional feuding but the cloning of what had passed for 
their government has exasperated many 
were fed up said amal hamdi 28 a secretary in west 
beirut we want this chaos to end however if formal partitioning 
would lead to security stability and better living conditions let 
it be 
lets either have formal partition or elect a new president 
but lets finish and know where we stand said pierre ayyoub 36 
who works at an east beirut trading company 
every government ministry now has two competing heads the 
40000man army the police and municipal departments are similarly 
split in two 
the only institution that has remained intact is the central 
bank which is financing both governments it is in west beirut 
mohammed hout economic adviser to bank governor edmond naim 
said the banks main objective is to provide the basic needs of 
people of both sides of the sectarian divide 
we extend advances to both governments to cover wages and 
salaries for the public sector to import essential commodities such 
as fuel and flour and spare parts to maintain such services as 
electricity and water hout explained 
we pay military salaries on both sides but we wont advance 
money for purchasing armaments 
the christian aoun has been pressing to impose his disputed 
authority on the central bank and in december he closed the only 
crossing point on the green line in a move widely seen as 
retaliation for the banks providing 100000 to moslem units 
the 10day closure kept food and fuel from reaching west beirut 
from the christian sector where the main government warehouses are 
situated 
aoun lifted the blockade after christian business interests 
complained they were unable to sell their goods in moslem sectors

one day last year state government was within 
an hour of not making the payroll one day in the future economists 
warn this city could be knocking on bankruptcys door bond ratings 
are just one notch above junk bonds 
times are hard in louisiana 
charity hospital clinics overflow because the state cant afford 
enough doctors to go around windows in city hall remain cracked and 
unrepaired children go to school in packed classrooms without 
modern teaching aids such as computers one town has to turn off 
street lights to save money 
we have become a state of mediocrity instead of a state of 
excellence said commissioner of administration dennis stine 
weve become a welfare state instead of a wealthy state 
times are hard in louisiana 
an estimated 30000 unskilled oil workers are unemployed some 
have been out of work so long their benefits ran out long ago many 
of the states skilled workers have fled to healthier regions in 
all close to 100000 jobs have been lost 
even worse antiquated laws from bygone boom days handcuff public 
officials efforts to attract new business and raise the money 
needed to improve education health care and the economy 
frenchcajun optimism the letthegoodtimesroll attitude that 
drank up boom after boom and thirsted through only occasional busts 
seems to be fading people have been packing up and moving out no 
hope of another oil boom they say no hope 
we seem to find people with short fuses lately said hubert 
chiasson the manager of new orleans largest unemployment office 
do i really see any signs of improvement no i really dont 
times are hard in louisiana 
the state was forced to borrow 13 billion to cover its debt 
and another 12 billion to bail out its insolvent unemployment 
insurance fund about 10 percent of the state tax collections now go 
to pay interest on debt 
sales taxes are already highest in the nation 9 percent in new 
orleans businesses fear that they will be taxed to bail the state 
out 
its a spiral you cant get new business so you cant employ 
all the people who need jobs said tim ryan director of business 
and economic research at the university of new orleans that 
doesnt mean we will spiral down any further but there will be no 
new growth 
in fact there are indicators that the economy has bottomed out 
after two years of depression there are no signs of improvement 
however 
the price of oil began its crash in 1984 and two years later a 
leading state business organization proclaimed that louisianas 
recession had become a depression unemployment reached 145 percent 
in january 1987 the latest figure is about 10 percent twice the 
national average 
despite its abundance of resources waterway location and 
reputation for good food and good times the state proved to be 
illprepared for the day when the oil gravy train stopped 
economists said 
the taxing structure dates back to the days of populist huey 
long who believed the people were entitled to a free ride at the 
expense of business most homes are exempt from property taxes many 
state services are offered at unusually low rates such as 3 a year 
for an automobile license plate 
gov buddy roemer tried to rearrange the fiscal structure but 
his first attempt failed in the legislature last fall he says hell 
try again and win because the future of the state depends on it 
we had a state where big money beat big ideas and thats a 
loser were trying to reverse it roemer said 
the state has a huge group estimated at 30000 of outofwork 
oil workers with no employable skills most dropped out of school 
for the lure of big money on oil rigs many dont even have the 
money now to pack up and move out 
how are we going to get our present work force into jobs 
asks eugene schreiber director of new orleans world trade center 
and chairman of a governors task force on labor we have to train 
and develop our workers 
new orleans has seen its sales tax revenue fall so far that the 
mayor said the only services left to cut were courts and school 
crossing guards the city has lost 100 million in revenue a full 
onethird of its entire budget since oil prices crashed 
the current budget is in a crisis mayor sidney barthelemy 
said in an interview before opting for an 8perhousehold public 
safety fee and slashing court funding from 25 million to 15 
million with layoffs in the district attorneys office 
but louisiana law says the city council cant raise property 
taxes without a general election and besides only 15 percent of 
the homeowners in new orleans pay property taxes by law 
the city council cant raise the sales tax by law it cant 
create an income tax by law 
all barthelemy says he can do is raise fees such as slapping a 
surcharge on water bills for public safety 
the city of shreveport in the northern part of the state 
balanced its budget by laying off 115 sanitation department workers 
abolishing back door garbage pickups and raising water and sewer 
rates 25 percent 
houma an oil town near the gulf of mexico found times were so 
hard that 3000 street lights had to be turned off to save money 
business has never been as bad said dan catlett owner of 
the houma pawn shop i cant see any improvement and im usually 
the first to tell 
new orleans school supt everett williams has had to cope with 
all the problems of a large urban school system while his budget 
has been slashed the state cut back on its funding so did the 
federal government and the city hes laid off 300 employees his 
teacherpupil ratio has climbed to 29to1 in elementary schools 
his counselortopupil ratio is 450to1 
voters approved a bond package to help the schools but its not 
enough this year the schools are operating with 30 million in 
bridge funding from the state williams is worried hell lose 
that money next year 
that could mean more layoffs a shorter school year and a budget 
so poor i really couldnt operate the school district 
williams like mayor barthelemy gov roemer economists and 
business leaders says the key to the future will be reshaping the 
tax structure to promote new business and remove the handcuffs from 
local governments despite the element of futility they see good 
times ahead 
i am optimistic and i guess thats how we survive williams 
said 
the governor added we are going to turn this state around

inside the dingy walls of indira gandhi 
childrens hospital doctors and nurses wage their own battle to 
save children from the savagery of the war boobytrapped toys 
rockets bombs and bullets 
mriya a 4yearold from charikar 45 miles north of kabul was 
badly injured three weeks ago by artillery fire as soviet and afghan 
troops attacked moslem guerrillas trying to topple the government 
she suffered broken bones but she was lucky ten of the 12 
people living in her house were killed 
six children injured in a guerrilla rocket attack in kabul were 
brought to the 300bed hospital last week doctors were able to save 
three of them 
when the parents of one of survivor were told their 12yearold 
sons right leg would have to be amputated the father sobbed and 
cried oh let him die let him die hes no good anymore 
even before civil war broke out in 1978 afghanistan had the 
worlds highest child mortality rate according to un statisics 
at least 340 of every 1000 children will not reach their fifth 
birthday and doctors and nurses working in a country where medical 
care is far below accepted standards are struggling to keep the 
number from rising 
we want to get away from politics as much as possible here 
said dr abdul salam jalali head of the 102member hospital staff 
there may be sons of mujahedeen guerrilla commanders here we 
dont ask they are children they are not directly involved in the 
war 
some children have been injured by toys rigged with explosives 
and left on streets it is unclear whether the booby traps are the 
work of afghan government forces or the guerrillas 
more than 1 million people have died in the war which has 
severely strained the hospital built in 1972 by india and named 
after its late prime minister it is always crowded and cockroaches 
climb the walls 
sometimes we put two or three patients in one bed sometimes we 
put them in a corridor or on the floor but we never refuse a 
patient and its all completely free jalali said 
the cost of medicine and food has soared and consumed the 
hospitals budget 
all medicine is imported and getting it to the hospital is 
difficult because of fuel shortages and guerrilla attacks on 
government convoys a lack of supplies often forces doctors to reuse 
bandages 
the war also has made it harder for afghanistans poor to afford 
nutritional food and has diverted attention from child health care 
they dont bother about these problems jalali said they 
just want to stay alive and when they finally do bring them to the 
hospital its often too late 
malnutrition is our main problem this has been going on for 
years but now its worse he said 
emaciated children their resistance weakened by lack of food 
suffer tuberculosis meningitis and other diseases 
in the final weeks of the soviet troop withdrawal kabul suffered 
severe food shortages vegetable and fruit stands at city markets 
now are full but prices are far beyond the reach of the poor 
the situation is worse for children in other parts of afghanistan 
khagal mohammad who livesin the laghman province east of kabul 
weighs about 15 pounds the normal weight for a 7monthold baby he 
is 4 years old 
mayabim a 5yearold from central hazarajat weighs only 20 
pounds and suffers from tuberculosis meningitis and brain damage 
we were too far away it took us too long to get here said 
his sobbing mother gulandam 
unicef the red crescent a moslem organization similar to the 
red cross and other charities also care for children but say more 
help is needed 
peace is a prerequisite and peace for afghanistan is not yet 
on the horizon said unicef spokesman vincent oreilley

quotations are the salt and pepper of political 
speeches and members of congress have long had their own wit and 
wisdom enlivened by them 
as often as not those quotes have come from the quote files 
maintained for the last 50 years by the congressional research 
service of the library of congress 
now 2100 of the best have been gleaned from those files and put 
between the covers of a book respectfully quoted in time for 
the celebration this year of the 200th anniversary of the convening 
of the 1st congress in 1789 
while the range is wide many of the quotations requested by 
congressmen concern congress itself even quotes which are less than 
flattering to the institution and its members 
congress is so strange a russian visitor observed a man 
gets up to speak and says nothing nobody listens and then 
everybody disagrees 
american humorist will rogers with congress every time they 
make a joke its a law and every time they make a law its a 
joke 
or the opening line from the actor playing john adams in the 
musical 1776 i have come to the conclusion that one useless 
man is called a disgrace that two are called a law firm and that 
three or more become a congress 
or this from mark twain it could probably be shown by facts 
or figures that there is no distinctly american criminal class 
except congress 
someone once asked the rev edward everett hale then chaplain of 
the senate do you pray for the senators dr hale 
the quoted reply no i look at the senators and pray for the 
country 
from sen john sharp williams dmiss at a 1923 farewell 
dinner i sometimes think id rather be a dog and bay at the moon 
then stay in the senate another six years and listen to it 
members of congress like other politicians obtain office 
through elections and the new volume has quotations to offer on that 
subject 
such as an election is coming universal peace is declared 
and the foxes have a sincere interest in prolonging the lives of the 
poultry george eliot the english author in 1866 
there is much advice on how to govern 
the great art of governing consists of not letting men grow 
old in their jobs napoleon bonaparte 
a government which robs peter to pay paul can always depend on 
the support of paul george bernard shaw 
there is no democratic or republican way of cleaning the 
streets fiorello la guardia 
politicians of course make promises 
abraham lincoln is alleged to have once said we must not 
promise what we ought not lest we be called on to perform what we 
cannot the congressional reference service says the accuracy of 
the quote cannot be verified 
it does vouch however for the authenticity of jonathan swifts 
declaration that promises and piecrusts are made to be 
broken

mayor teddy kollek jerusalems peacemaker for a 
generation is virtually assured an unprecedented sixth term in 
elections this month but his dream of a truly united city seems out 
of reach 
kollek is expected to lose control of the city council to 
religious and rightwing parties in the feb 28 vote a development 
that could heat up the religious and arabjewish conflicts dividing 
the city of 500000 
the 77yearold kollek knows what hes up against 
you have an increase of the extreme edges on all sides said 
kollek citing rises in religious nationalist and secular activism 
to keep a middle line is very complicated 
during a recent campaign stop in the outdoor mahane yehuda 
market a rowdy stronghold of rightwing sentiments he looked out 
of place in his blue wool suit and brown fur hat but he was 
thronged by the vendors some applauding and shouting teddy 
teddy 
his popularity is expected to help the viennaborn mayor match 
his 1983 results when he won 65 percent in the direct vote his one 
jerusalem slate took 17 of 31 city council seats 
but this year kollek could lose council control because of the 
growing strength of the religious parties and the announced election 
boycott by arab voters traditionally kollek supporters 
working with a hostile council would weaken kollek who has been 
credited for keeping much of the bloodshed of the 14monthold 
palestinian uprising out of jerusalem by trying to cool tempers and 
arguing with aggressive policemen 
the religioussecular conflict heated up in the summer of 1987 
when orthodox jewish men in black coats and hats hurled stones at 
friday night moviegoers to protest the screening of films on the 
jewish sabbath 
the movie wars are part of an intensified ultraorthodox 
campaign for more laws guarding the sanctity of the sabbath and 
greater budget allocations for religious education and housing 
we are fighting for the soul of the nation said rabbi 
yitzhak peretz leader of the ultraorthodox shas party in a 
campaign video 
shas and others are not targeting the sure orthodox vote about 
30 percent of the citys 350000 jewish residents 
they are after less observant jews seeking reassurance in 
troubled times the same voters who were mainly responsible for the 
religious parties gains in the november general election 
secular activists warn that the black hats will turn 
jerusalem into an iranstyle theocracy the city turns into a 
virtual ghost town on the sabbath forcing many residents to drive 
40 miles to tel aviv for weekend entertainment 
the orthodox are saying we took on the knesset parliament 
and jerusalem is next said anat hoffman a council candidate for 
the secular citizens rights movement 
across town in arab east jerusalem there are no indications 
that an election campaign is being waged 
many palestinians have stayed away from elections to show they 
dont accept the annexation of east jerusalem which israel captured 
from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
in 1983 12000 of the citys 150000 arab residents cast votes 
but this year all the arab residents are expected to boycott the 
elections leaders of the uprising against israeli rule in the 
occupied territories have urged activists to strike against all 
who participate in such an election 
participation in the elections would imply that we accept 
unilateral annexation said hanna siniora a palestine liberation 
organization supporter and editor of the arabiclanguage al fajr 
newspaper 
siniora acknowledged however that kollek had a better image 
among palestinians than his opponents 
kollek said tolerance was the central message of his campaign 
this is a very complicated city we have jews from 103 
different backgrounds 40 different christian denominations and we 
have arabs who arent all united either kollek said 
if we wont be tolerant toward one another there will be no 
life in the city

the government agency regulating the savings 
and loan industry has relaxed its reading of an internal rule in a 
way that apparently will allow one of its top officials to keep his 
stock in a family business 
the rule which had prompted federal home loan bank board member 
roger martin to promise to get rid of the stock has been 
interpreted too literally according to harry w quillian deputy 
general counsel for the board 
martin promised when he joined the board in 1987 that he would 
divest himself of his 29 percent interest in pope scientific inc 
that promise was made to the office of government ethics and 
incorporated into martins sworn testimony during his senate 
confirmation hearing 
once he made that promise federal ethics laws required martin to 
carry through and rid himself of the stock within 90 days of his 
confirmation but he says he did not want to dispose of his holding 
in the company and after making his promise received verbal advice 
that he could keep the stock 
quillian wrote to martin last week saying that the interpretation 
of the agencys rules he gave martin in 1987 was wrong 
the original interpretation resulted from defining the word 
employee in the board regulation so broadly that it would in 
effect consider a company in which an employee owned a substantial 
interest an employee of the board as well as the actual employee 
himself 
that way rules on such things as conflicts of interest and 
ethics would apply not only to board employees but to the actions 
of companies in which they held a substantial interest 
while that is certainly the literal interpretation of that 
provision such an interpretation would of course be 
unenforceable quillian wrote to martin last week accordingly 
we have decided after further research and reflection that the 
definition cannot and should not be interpreted literally 
pope scientific based in menomonee falls wis manufactures 
laboratory glassware and instruments while it has done work for the 
government from time to time it would have little or no occasion to 
bring it into contact with the federal home loan bank board 
in letters to the milwaukee sentinel and usa today martin 
complained that under the literal interpretation of the boards 
rules i would have had to report on federal financial disclosure 
forms the entire interest of pope as if i were its sole owner 
until martin became a member of the bank board in 1987 he was 
pope scientifics chairman his wife ann owns 51 percent of the 
company and is its president his son geoffrey is vice president 
martin also said that there is no such requirement that would 
compel him to sell his interest in the company 
however gary davis chief counsel for the office of government 
ethics said that once martin made a promise to divest he either 
had to do it or explain why not 
he has a requirement to act on the terms of his ethics 
agreement unless he provides an explanation for the change in 
conditions davis said 
using the range categories on financial disclosure forms martin 
listed his 29 percent stake in the company as being worth between 
100000 and 250000 
martin did sell other financial holdings when he joined the bank 
board he had held stock in mgic investment corp and was vice 
president of mortgage guaranty insurance corp he sold that stock 
resigned the post and promised not to take part in matters affecting 
that company or the mortgage insurance industry 
the bank board which regulates and audits the nations savings 
and loans has been overrun with work as that industry has sunk into 
such deep financial trouble that president bush has proposed a 
massive federal bailout 
some of the boards paperwork has fallen through the cracks 
for the last any number of months weve been like onearmed 
paper hangers quillian said 
but in the present circumstances it seemed like it was well to 
drop everything and get this out on paper which weve now done 
quillian said 
asked what the present circumstances were he replied you 
guys writing about it

kadi umarou emerged from a 
helmetshaped granary of golden straw her arms laden with millet 
stalks and headed home past a dozen other new granaries built for 
the best harvest in 20 years 
this country on the southern edge of the sahara desert which has 
been forced to ask the world for food repeatedly for more than a 
decade is feeding itself this year 
rains last spring and summer were plentiful and farmers say 
conditions for planting hadnt been better in 30 years the 
government reported a grain surplus of more than 200000 tons after 
the harvest last fall enough to carry the country through this 
springs planting 
pastures are green and herds are increasing bellies are full and 
children are smiling things are as good as they have been in a 
long long time 
my children eat now when they want my husband is strong i am 
less afraid and still there is more grain mrs umarou said 
speaking in the tribal language of djerma through a translator 
but in a region where problems are profound a year as good as 
1988 shows just how bad things really are 
ernest gibson an official with the us agency for international 
development in niamey about 20 miles away said bumper harvests in 
this west african nation are so rare some villagers didnt know what 
to do 
in one village they have gone a whole generation without 
anything left over so they didnt know how to construct granaries 
the government sent a team to teach them gibson said 
from mauritania on the atlantic coast across to ethiopia in the 
east the situation was much the same with the countries on the vast 
arid border south of the sahara reporting better than average 
rainfall in 1988 record harvests were reported in burkina faso 
chad and mali 
if it rained for 20 years you would have healthy people in 
niger said gibson but you have to turn that abundance into 
productive sustainable nonagricultural activities if not when 
the rain stops in the 21st year you will need emergency food 
many experts in development agencies say wealthy people here tend 
to invest their money abroad exceptions are those who build houses 
in the capital to rent and others who buy agricultural products and 
horde them for resale 
there is a surplus of millet prices have fallen and there is 
no government price support said olav bakken jensen of care 
the rich merchants buy it hold it until there isnt any food and 
then resell it often to aid agencies at inflated prices who 
distribute it as emergency food they cant go wrong and the poor 
farmer who needs the cash has no choice but to sell 
even one obvious benefit of the good harvest wellfed 
youngsters has a sobering side 
of course the children born this year will get a better 
start said jensen but then there will be more babies more 
marriages by people who have been putting off getting married for 
years even the government has informally asked people to not use 
their extra income to buy too many wives but this is precisely what 
is happening 
in the eastern province of zinder mike edwards of tulane 
universitys school of public health has been weighing babies in a 
project for care he has found some surprising results the number 
of children suffering acute malnutrition has decreased since the 
famine of 1984 but the number of children with chronic malnutrition 
is on the rise 
those who were starved as infants have not yet recovered he 
said and malnutrition is tied to more than simply how much a child 
eats 
millet is good and children this year are getting lots of 
millet but they are not getting the variety of protein and vitamins 
babies need for muscle growth a baby needs quality not just 
quantity edwards explained 
still any respite in the harsh environment cant help but boost 
morale 
in the first year or two of drought a person can retain some 
hope said horacio soares director of the agricultural weather 
station set up to monitor conditions after the disastrous 107273 
drought 
but after years and years you just give up with rain people 
feel happier theyre willing to cooperate with government programs 
and even push for more help with development

liberian president samuel doe 
one frustrated american participant said doe could not be 
persuaded to abandon his practice of maintaining an extracurricular 
budget outside the governments control 
the premature termination roughly halfway into the twoyear 
project coming as it does on the heels of a congressional freeze on 
aid to liberia may be prompting doe into action 
doe a former army sergeant who took power in a bloody 1980 coup 
is considering a trip to the funeral of japans emperor hirohito in 
hopes of meeting president bush liberian officials and dissidents 
say 
although the evolving situation remains in flux analysts are 
concerned it could prompt a renewal of threats against us 
interests in the coastal african nation which is supported largely 
by us foreign aid and investment 
the project which stemmed from does efforts to boost us 
support and introduce some order into his government finances was 
billed as a 155 million program when it was signed in 1987 
the unusual arrangement which gave american experts the right to 
cosign liberian government checks was made possible by the historic 
links between the united states and liberia a country of 23 
million residents that was founded in the 19th century by freed 
slaves 
all but one or two of the 17 experts who have stayed behind to 
complete computerization programs are now back in the united 
states said fred berger vice president of lewis berger 
international which conducted the project under contract to the 
us government 
the team was frustrated by lack of support from doe and by his 
practice of maintaining a budget outside the governments control 
berger said 
a statement by the agency for international development said the 
project achieved progress in getting the government to meet its 
payroll on time pay pensions and increase tax receipts 
unfortunately progress was not uniform and some serious problems 
could not be resolved said the statement 
dissidents and congressional staffers said the team discovered 
that doe manages part of the government budget like a discretionary 
slush fund which was outside the purview of the american experts 
a spokesman at the liberian embassy paul yarl declined to 
discuss the project saying only that it had been completed in a 
satisfactory manner 
specifically revenues from the governmentowned corporations for 
forestry and petroleum products which account for about 40 percent 
of the states income were handled directly by doe said amos 
sawyer an exiled liberian political scientist who heads a dissident 
organization in the united states 
doe uses these funds to cater to various whims sawyer said for 
example when liberias soccer team beat ghana last year doe 
declared a national holiday and gave the team 1 million 
but berger said doe also used the money for public works projects 
and to pay back official bank loans 
doe has not protested the recent setbacks in relations with 
washington said us embassy spokesman david krecke in a telephone 
conversation from monrovia 
but there is concern that doe may renew past threats against us 
communications facilities and military access rights officials 
said they spoke on condition of anonymity 
liberia experts say he has not acted on these threats in the past 
because too much of his economy depends on american investments 
the united states has been the bulwark of liberias economy 
pouring 434 million in financial aid between 1980 and 1986 there 
also is some 400 million worth of private us investment in 
liberia much of it in rubber plantations iron ore mining and 
forestry 
the united states maintains a relay station for voice of america 
broadcasts to africa and southern europe officials said there is 
also a diplomatic communications facility that handles traffic from 
us posts in africa to the united states 
the us coast guard is involved in running a tracking station 
for navigation in the region officials said 
economic aid to liberia which suffers from a crushing debt 
burden and foreign exchange shortages was frozen last year after 
the state department failed to certify that the country had made 
progress in rectifying human rights abuses officials said 
as a result congress has so far withheld 22 million in aid 
about onethird of the funds allotted to liberia according to aid 
the state departments recently released report on human rights 
says liberias record was set back in 1988 by several adverse 
developments including the unexplained deaths of several men 
while in detention for unsubstantiated charges of plotting a coup

six months ago angry miners shut down 
the deep coal mines ringing this desolate city in southern poland to 
demand the government recognize solidarity 
now the miners seem to be within reach of their goal but some 
fear that even a free trade union will not be enough to fight the 
poverty that caused them to strike in the first place 
since feb 6 government and solidarity representatives have been 
talking in warsaw and they are near agreement on terms to reinstate 
the union after a sevenyear ban 
their eyes shadowed with coal dust the miners talked quietly 
last week while waiting to greet solidarity leader lech walesa at 
the manifest lipcowy mine where the first strike began 
things havent changed much we dont know what it is were 
going to get and we dont know when said jan pilat whose job 
during the strikes was to sound the alarm when police prepared to 
rush the mine gates 
walesa came to manifest lipcowy to tell solidarity activists how 
the talks in warsaw 220 miles to the north were proceeding 
local union leader alojzy pietrzyk calls jastrzebie a city of 
just more than 100000 people a concrete reservation 
but in the 1960s and 70s thousands of workers flocked to 
jastrzebie attracted by the promise of good wages and housing in 
the new apartments the government had slapped together 
in its haste to attract workers to mine the nearby rich lodes of 
black coal the government left a few things out 
stores are few and poorly stocked a couple of restaurants and a 
few movie theaters and discos can be found hidden among the high 
rises 
now there is a housing shortage and young miners are forced to 
spend years living in workers hotels 
there is nothing to do and nothing to buy said one miner 
alfred rutkowski things are really hard and i dont think theyll 
get better 
what bothers miners most is a pay system that forces them to work 
for bonus money on saturday and sunday to earn enough to survive 
and primitive working conditions that claimed the lives of 85 miners 
in poland last year 
it was disgust over managements failure to honor raises 
negotiated by the official trade union alliance opzz that led to the 
strike at manifest lipcowy when miners opened their pay envelopes 
aug 15 
the strike spread rapidly to other mines in poland and the no 1 
demand became the reinstatement of solidarity the east blocs first 
free trade union it had operated legally for 16 months before being 
outlawed in 1982 
walesa agreed to suspend the strikes when authorities proposed 
talks with the opposition and promised to include solidaritys 
future on the agenda 
but the coal miners were skeptical and it took a visit from 
walesa and hours of hard bargaining to persuade them to stop the 
strike on its 19th day 
the miners see solidarity as the only means by which they can 
present grievances in negotiations with management 
during his visit tuesday walesa told miners i know you are 
tired with your work these conditions with what is happening on 
the market with your families but i would like to talk to you 
without censorship so i could understand my mistakes and your 
strivings 
the workers asked walesa how he could trust the government he 
said he lacked specific answers but urged the miners to help rebuild 
poland 
everything shows now there is a civilized solution we have 
to have a bit of responsibility he said 
i appeal to you to build organizations there are so many 
problems you have to approach them in an organized way walesa 
said 
solidarity regional leader adam kowalczyk needed no pep talk 
while some workers hounded walesa for autographs after the meeting 
kowalczyk scurried around and pressed miners to take freshly printed 
solidarity signup sheets 
management says they still dont want to talk to us but they 
arent stopping us from organizing and there is a lot to do said 
kowalczyk

the national weather service is struggling 
through a budget crunch hoping to delay the threatened closing of 
weather offices until they can be replaced by new automated 
equipment in a few years 
over the long term the agency seems likely to close a hundred or 
more of its nearly 250 local offices replacing them with an 
extensive network of automated informationgathering equipment 
but even as that planning is underway officials are trying to 
cope with a money shortage in the current fiscal year that could 
grow even more severe in 1990 
the reagan administration annually has proposed closing large 
numbers of weather offices to save money 
and although congress has thwarted that in the past a hiring 
freeze has had to be imposed this year and some local offices may be 
in jeopardy because of the lack of money 
the current fiscal year is expected to end with the weather 
service short between 10 million and 28 million although national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said things are looking brighter than they 
were a few weeks ago 
noaa spending proposed by former president reagan for 1990 
meanwhile was set at 114 billion down from 119 billion in the 
current fiscal year 
and while the national weather service was marked for somewhat of 
an increase within that budget that has to include money to cover 
the purchase of new radar and observation equipment and a 
supercomputer 
the reagan proposal called for staff cuts consolidations of 
offices and for private weather services to take on more specialized 
forecasting tasks while the government concentrates on general 
forecasts and warnings 
full details of the reagan proposal were not released by the 
office of management and budget but word on capitol hill was that 
the plan could have required closing as many as 62 local weather 
offices this year and 77 more in 1990 
congressional sources said the bush administration may be 
reconsidering whether such drastic cuts are necessary noaa 
officials said they are discussing with omb ways to keep offices 
open but details were not being made public 
however the two pages slated to include the list of station 
closings were left blank when the 1990 noaa budget was sent to the 
printers according to warren kane of the senate appropriations 
subcommittee that oversees noaa 
some closings may occur in cases of obvious duplication where 
stations are relatively close together he said 
once new automated equipment is in place more extensive office 
closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would 
not be hindered noaa officials say but that would occur over 
several years perhaps as long as a decade 
noaa officials say the automated observing equipment is planned 
for installation in three times as many locations as there are 
currently weather offices 
the national weather service employees organization however has 
said that the closings eventually could affect a hundred offices or 
more 
and noaa officials privately admit that after the reorganization 
is complete they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices 
compared to the current 250 or so reductions in staff would occur 
by attrition they say 
the longterm the weather service modernization plan was 
originally scheduled to be sent to congress last week but that has 
been delayed 
a complicating factor is the fact that many top officials of the 
commerce department leave office march 1 and others remain on the 
job but unsure whether they will be transferred or replaced 
the office of management and budget says the noaa budget is part 
of a group of domestic programs frozen at 1989 levels included in a 
136 billion pot of programs subject to negotiation with 
congress

they met in the maine legislature on the 
republican side of the aisle the ravenhaired representative from 
auburn seated directly behind the handsome young floor leader from 
bangor 
when she decided to run for congress in 1978 they got together 
to map out campaign strategy over the years their shared interest 
in politics blossomed into something more 
the decadelong courtship between rep olympia snowe and gov 
john r mckernan will culminate this week in an exchange of marriage 
vows 
what holds our relationship together is the fact that we love 
politics said snowe now in her sixth term in congress for 
some that becomes a dividing factor but in our case that obviously 
hasnt been the situation 
we both have our own careers and they happen to be in the same 
field said mckernan a former twoterm congressman who was 
elected governor in 1986 we understand the pressures that are on 
each other 
the wedding friday at the greek orthodox church of the holy 
trinity in lewiston snowe is of greek descent will begin the 
second marriage for both 
the announcement of their pending nuptials three weeks ago evoked 
surprise that two of a small states most prominent political 
figures could have kept a romance of nearly a decade relatively 
private 
a hushhush affair marveled one of snowes constituents 
frances boisvert of lewiston nobody seemed to know anything about 
it but its nice 
snowe who turns 42 on tuesday was widowed in 1973 when her 
husband was killed in an accident while driving home from the 
legislature where he served in the house she entered politics by 
running successfully for his seat 
the 40yearold mckernans first marriage ended in divorce in 
1978 he has an 18yearold son peter 
mckernan and snowe realize they will spend most of their time 600 
miles apart one in washington the other in the state capital of 
augusta getting together on weekends and during congressional 
recesses 
they will try as much as possible to coordinate their schedules 
and expect to divide their time between the blaine house the 
executive mansion in augusta and snowes home in auburn 35 miles 
away 
the most important factor in any relationship is 
communication snowe said describing their daily telephone 
conversations talking about what happens during the day to each 
of us makes it feel were not that far away 
snowe and mckernan said they believe their careers will insulate 
them from the problems of other politicians whose marriages broke 
because they were unable to balance their political responsibilities 
with the demands of family life 
in other marriages mckernan noted only one of them is 
involved in politics and the other one gets left behind a lot 
they acknowledge their differences in personality he is 
deliberate an outgrowth of his legal training she tends to rely 
more heavily on instinct 
the romance blossomed while the two were in washington serving 
as maines delegation in the house their private joke on their 
trips home your district or mine 
the relationship was never splashed across the front pages but 
neither was it concealed whenever the subject was broached by 
reporters snowe and mckernan acknowledged that they dated each 
other but offered no elaboration 
the reaction to their engagement has been positive they said 
with congratulatory calls from president and barbara bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis referring to his and snowes 
shared ethnic background dukakis told mckernan that mixed 
marriages work especially if one of the partners is greek 
mckernan is a protestant 
their honeymoon will be a weekend in new york with dinner and the 
theater both must be in washington the following week snowe to 
tend to her congressional duties and mckernan for a meeting of the 
nations governors 
while the wedding itself will be limited to family members and 
close friends the couple mailed invitations to 7500 friends and 
political supporters for a reception the following week at the 
augusta civic center

rep john lewis a liberal democrat and black 
veteran of the civil rights wars of the 60s is willing to put his 
enthusiasm for white conservative republican jack kemp in the 
language understood on the poor street corners of america 
he can walk the walk and he can talk the talk lewis said 
recently of the bush administrations housing chief 
lewis deliberate use of an expression more familiar in the black 
neighborhoods he represents than in the white suburbs that produced 
kemp was meant to communicate the meaning was clear despite their 
differences this man kemp is ok hes all right 
lewiss comment last week came after two days of tramping with 
the former pro quarterback through those atlanta neighborhoods in 
kemps first look at inner city problems since becoming secretary of 
the housing and urban development 
kemp went oneonone with atlantas black leaders and veterans of 
the civil rights struggle of the 1950s and 60s such as lewis 
mayor andrew young and the family of the late martin luther king jr 
offering them his own brand of bubbly irrepressible excitement 
about the power of unleashed free enterprise 
all welcomed him warmly and seemed to confirm what kemps 
supporters were arguing during his unsuccessfully presidential 
campaign last year kemp architect of the 1981 income tax cuts now 
so identified with ronald reagan has a strong reservoir of good 
will among blacks 
we have serious problems as you well understand coretta 
scott king widow of the late civil rights leader told him you 
lift our spirits because you have hope they can be solved 
taking control of hud kemp heads a department important for 
urban blacks because it administers the federal programs for housing 
and redevelopment of blighted cities programs that are 
dramatically reduced after eight years under president reagan kemp 
hopes to make hud the catalyst for new incentives to attract private 
development into those same neighborhoods 
kemps support among blacks could be of benefit to the new 
administration and to the republican party as bush and new 
republican national chairman lee atwater set out to win black 
support away from democrats and it could benefit kemp in the future 
theres no question that a candidate who can attract the 
support of rockribbed conservatives and urban blacks would make one 
hell of a candidate said kemps political consultant roger stone 
kemp himself tried to sidestep the political questions that is 
tangential he said the best politics is to do a good job 
many cite kemps background in professional football where was 
quarterback team captain and president of the players union as a 
source of black support he has maintained friendships with 
prominent blacks and has hired wendell wilkie gunn a black 
conservative and former reagan white house aide as his chief of 
staff 
he knows his safety and indeed his life depended on the ability 
of black linemen said the rev joseph e lowery head of the 
southern christian leadership conference 
but it is also due to kemps enthusiastic talk about doing 
something to solve the housing problem facing the poor more than 
just his proposals for enterprise zones and other inducements to 
attract private business into the inner cities kemp has raised 
expectations just by talking about making progress on housing that 
trait is even more noticeable coming on the heels of a relative 
eightyear silence by his predecessor sam pierce 
he has the kind of creative mind that i admire young a 
democrat and former congressman said right now things are so 
bad that weve got to work together and solve problems we can get

scoowvtswc9y7 new job 
with the highest visibility on domestic policy in the 
administration he was trailed through atlantas streets by a bus 
full of reporters and television cameras he plans a second tour 
next week of homelessness in northeastern cities 
but kemps high visibility and bold talk carries risk 
he is given to sweeping statements and boundless expectations 
which democrats are no doubt recording for replay in four years if 
he falls short 
i want to eliminate poverty kemp told one group in atlanta 
theres not going to be any homelessness unless we turn our backs 
and let it happen he told another 
kemp has acknowledged the need for more affordable housing 
without promising any more federal spending to build it bushs 
budget proposal for fiscal 1990 contains no new spending on public 
housing and the budget deficit provides little reason for housing 
advocates to expect even kemp can come up with new spending 
initiatives 
some democrats have begun to suggest that kemp with his 
visibility and big talk has overplayed his hand 
he has clearly upstaged the president and that is usually not 
smart politics democratic party spokesman mike mccurry said 
he runs the risk of overpromising himself early mccurry 
added hes setting himself up for a long fall 
mrs king seemed to be offering kemp a similar caution as well 
when they met with the citys black leaders 
from everything weve heard you say we think you mean 
business she said if something happens and there is not the 
follow through youre going to have a lot of disappointed people

a cbs affiliate isnt inviting the network

focused on the citys crime problem and was misleading and very 
superficial the affiliates news director said 
our video files will not be open to cbs nor will any editing 
facilities or satellite equipment be available any story you do 
you will do on your own you wont have our help joe duke news 
director of local affiliate wwl said in a letter to cbs news 
president david burk 
duke wrote to protest a report on cbs evening news done by 
correspondent peter van zant during mardi gras earlier this month 
the report began with a brief mention of our mardi gras 
celebration and juxtaposed that with a series of murder scenes and 
a long discussion of our crime problems duke wrote 
although there has been an increase in murders this year duke 
said that to combine the elements of mardi gras and the crime 
problem in a very quick piece creates a simplistic misleading and 
very superficial look at our city and in no way reflects what the 
community is doing to solve the problem

he was not familiar with the situation and could not comment he 
referred calls to another spokesman but a message left on his 
telephone answering machine wasnt returned 
new orleans had almost a slaying a day during january and police 
said they found the body of the 34th victim of the year saturday

graduating cadets during commencement exercises at the philippine 
military academy 150 miles north of manila 
ignore them she ordered ignore them out of patriotism 
ingore them out of prudence this country this government and this 
leader have more strength than appearances suggest 
graduates of the nations only military academy spearheaded the 
six armed attempts to topple mrs aquino since she took power in the 
february 1986 civilianmilitary uprising against president ferdinand 
marcos 
troops here and in manila were placed on maximum alert in advance 
of sundays commencement because of rumors that rightwing

the republican national committee said it will 
seek to censure david duke the former ku klux klan leader who won a 
seat in the louisiana state legislature saying he is a 
charlatan who does not reflect gop principles 
david duke is not a republican rnc chairman lee atwater said 
in a statement released by the party hes a pretender a 
charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any 
organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of racial 
and religious bigotry and intolerance 
we repudiate him in his views and we will take steps to see 
that he is disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the 
official winner in saturdays election atwater said 
what does it take to be a republican other than registering 
yourself as a republican i think hes atwater typical of some the 
republican leadershipin that he doesnt really have his finger 
on the pulse of the people and know what a real republican is 
dukes campaign manager howie farrell told the associated press in a 
broadcast interview 
i think that hes way off base and needs to reassess where he 
stands when the dust settles i think hell find that hes probably 
further out of the mainstream of republicanism than is david duke 
in unofficial results saturday night duke narrowly defeated 
homebuilder john treen to represent a state house district in 
metairie a suburb of new orleans duke registered with the gop two 
days before qualifying to run in the house race treen also is a 
member of the republican party 
rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said that if duke is officially 
certified the winner atwater will call a meeting of the partys 
executive committee within the next week to consider a motion of 
censure against duke 
the motion proposes that the republican party reject and 
condemn david duke his beliefs and the hate and fear he promotes 
and reaffirm its commitment to equal opportunity for all regardless 
of race creed religion sex or national origin 
it also would preclude duke from receiving any type of aid from 
the republican party such an action would be unprecedented within 
the party ms goodman said adding i would not imagine that 
there would be a single person on the rnc executive committee who 
would disagree with this 
atwater speaking in atlanta at a georgia republican party 
function saturday night acknowledged the partys involvement in the 
louisiana race is a very unusual thing for the national party to 
do but this man does not deserve to be in office 
president bush and former president reagan both aided treens

david duke a former grand wizard of the ku 
klux klan narrowly defeated homebuilder john treen to win a seat 
saturday in the louisiana legislature after a campaign peppered with 
charges of racism 
duke had 8456 votes or 51 percent and treen had 8232 votes 
or 49 percent a scant 224vote difference 
duke hailed his victory as the greatest upset in the history of 
louisiana politics 
i dont think theres been a candidate in recent history who 
has been more attacked slandered lied about and hurt in the way i 
was hurt and our good people were hurt in this campaign he said 
in a victory speech 
duke 38 and treen 63 battled it out for a month to represent 
the almost allwhite house district in metairie a new orleans 
suburb with about 21000 voters both men ran as republicans 
treen called duke a disaster for our area 
i know what this man really is he said the public 
doesnt or they wouldnt have voted the way they did hes a master 
of deception he conned them into believing he is something he is 
not 
fearing a duke victory and an embarrassment for the gop 
president bush and former president reagan threw their considerable 
weight behind treen a longtime party functionary 
nearly 78 percent of the voters turned out for the runoff 
election 
gop chairman lee atwater denounced duke in a statement issued 
saturday night by leslie goodman spokeswoman for the republican 
national committee 
david duke is not a republican atwater said hes a 
pretender a charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking 
for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of 
racial and religious bigotry and intolerance 
we repudiate him in his views and we are taking immediate steps 
to see that he is disenfranchised from our party 
goodman said that if duke is certified the winner atwater will 
call a meeting of the gop executive committee to present a formal 
motion for censure which goodman said would be an unprecedented 
action 
asked about atwaters remarks duke said he cant do that who 
does he think he is the people have spoken 
three of the candidates who lost in the primary have said they 
would file a lawsuit if duke won challenging whether he lived in 
the district for a year as required by state law 
democrat state rep ron gomez said dukes election would probably 
be challenged by the legislature on the residency issue 
howie farrell dukes campaign manager said his camp was 
concerned that treens supporters might try to tamper with voting 
machines before the result is certified 
all they gotta do is flip a button here a button there and 
its a new race he said 
duke won 33 percent of the vote to lead a field of seven in the 
jan 21 primary treen got 19 percent 
under louisianas open primary system the top two votegetters 
in a primary regardless of party face each other in a runoff if no 
candidate receives more than half the vote the seat opened up when 
metairies representative was elected to a judgeship with about 
three years left in a fouryear term 
the election returned the spotlight to duke who in the 1970s was 
photographed in a nazi uniform and boldly removed the hood of his 
white robe to become an international spokesman for the klan 
its an era that duke claimed to be sorry for but treen said he 
didnt believe that 
i regret it because people might think im racially or 
religiously intolerant duke said 
duke left the knights of the ku klux klan in 1980 accused by 
another leader of selling secret membership rolls he formed the 
national association for the advancement of white people which he 
says is a civil rights organization for everyone 
the final days of the race brought renewed charges that duke 
still was associated with rightwing extremists including 
examerican nazi leader ralph forbes of arkansas duke acknowledged 
forbes had been campaign manager in his 1988 bid for the presidency 
as a member of the populist party 
in the general election he ran in 15 states and drew less than 
05 percent of the national total vote 
he began his presidential bid as a democrat but was repudiated by 
party officials he got no delegates at the democratic national 
convention 
two days before qualifying for the house race he registered with 
the gop but the republican national committee also rejected him 
fearful the charismatic duke would overshadow the mildmannered 
treen the committee enlisted their top two politicians in the 11th 
hour of the campaign bush and reagan to try to keep duke from 
going to the legislature as a member of their party 
the backing from bush and reagan is unprecedented in a local 
legislative race state and national gop officials said locally an 
archbishop senators a university president and democrats voiced 
their support for treen or their opposition to duke 
letters from bush promoting treens candidacy arrived at most 
homes in the district by election day 
i cant help but tell you of the high regard i have for one 
candidate in the race for the 81st district john treen reagan 
said in the heavily played radio spot 
the race also attracted international attention with reporters 
from british dutch french west german and other foreign 
newspapers covering it 
treen was state campaign chairman for bushs 1980 presidential 
bid his brother dave was louisiana governor from 1980 to 1984 he 
also was a member of the states rights party of louisiana in the 
1950s which he said was not formed as a racist group although many 
members were segregationists 
i left that behind a long time ago treen said 
despite the celebrity of the race louisiana property taxes 
remained a key issue 
duke promised to reject any attempts to reduce the states 
75000 homestead exemption treen supports gov buddy roemers 
plans to revise the state tax code plans that could include raising 
property taxes by reducing the homestead exemption

an aide has urged former president nixons friends 
to stonewall it when producers ask for help in making a television 
version of the book the final days a newspaper reported 
nixon reportedly hated the book by bob woodward and carl 
bernstein which gave a detailed account of the last days in the 
watergatebattered white hous and blames it for a stroke suffered 
by his wife pat 
in a memo to a few dozen nixon loyalists aide john taylor said 
abc is asking for help on a film about the nixon presidency 
without saying the project is based on the final days the miami 
herald reported saturday 
because of the singularly odious and vicious nature of this 
project we are asking everyone in deference to the nixon family 
to refuse to have anything to do either with this project or indeed 
for the time being with abc taylor wrote 
it may well be that the producers wish to recruit other of 
president nixons friends and family and are therefore covering up 
the true nature of the project as long as possible the memo says 
they must be aware of the reaction that they would get from rn 
loyalists at the mention of the books title 
woodward who is helping with the movie says theres no coverup 
on the producers part 
this is the classic enemieslist mentality that led to all the 
trouble woodward said friday my question to mr taylor is 
dont they ever learn

president najib declared a nationwide 
state of emergency saturday and replaced seven nonparty members of 
cabinet in moves apparently aimed at consolidating his partys power 
najib blamed us aid to afghan guerrillas in part for the state 
of emergency which sharply reins in civil liberties 
the emergency was announced on staterun radio and television by 
najib who said it was needed to ensure peace and security in 
afghanistan 
it came three days after the last soviet soldiers who had been 
backing najibs army in its war with moslem guerrillas left the 
country 
on saturday night darilanguage television and radio announced 
najibs shakeup of seven nonparty members of 28member cabinet a 
move confirmed by the government sunday 
replaced were the ministers of higher education commerce 
education light industries and foodstuffs public health civil 
aviation and repatriation 
najib however appointed a nonparty member to become minister 
for islamic affairs a post that had been created in october but was 
vacant five other posts are held by nonmembers of najibs peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan 
the government also ordered 500 party members in kabul to report 
for military duty in an effort to maintain security in the capital 
during the day saturday troops tanks and armored personnel 
carriers appeared at most intersections in kabul and soldiers were 
stationed on the roofs of buildings 
foreign ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani told foreign 
journalists that under the state of emergency troops would have the 
right to open fire if they believed reporters or photographers were 
behaving suspiciously 
the city of 225 million people remained relatively calm but 
guerrillas surround kabul and many diplomats believe the government 
will collapse shortly 
in islamabad pakistan afghan guerrilla leaders nominated 
mohammad nabi mohammadi as acting president and ahmad shah as acting 
prime minister of an interim government that would take over if 
najibs government fell 
a special council of 400 delegates was to formally approve the 
appointments sunday 
afghan government radio reported that five people were killed and 
four injured saturday in rocket attacks mounted by moslem guerrillas 
in various parts of afghanistan 
the state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limit 
constitutional rights that protect against confiscation of property 
and searches of property provide for confidentiality of 
corresondence and telephone conversations allow peaceful assembly 
and demonstrations protect freedom of expression and provide for 
freedom from compulsory labor 
najib said the emergency was temporary but he did not set a 
time limit under the constitution an emergency can last three 
months but can be extended with the consent of the national assembly 
amani said clandestine activities that were terrorizing the 
afghan people prompted the declaration speaking at a news briefing 
he said these activities included the circulation of night 
letters unsigned pamphlets warning residents to stay off the 
streets close their businesses and stay away from the airport 
these created an air in which people were being terrified of a 
rocket attack on kabul amani said 
amani also said the refusal of the united states and pakistan to 
halt the supply of arms to the rebels made the state of emergency 
necessary 
a state of emergency has been imposed in afghanistan once before 
in 1978 after the communists seized power in a military coup it 
was lifted in 1979 the same year soviet troops intervened in the 
civil war 
the soviets announced all their troops had been withdrawn 
wednesday the deadline set by a unmediated accord signed last 
year the guerrillas were not a party to the accord and have vowed 
to overthrow najibs government 
the constitution allows the government to declare an emergency 
when it deems that the countrys independence sovereignty 
territorial integrity and internal security are impossible to 
maintain due to war danger of war disturbances of war or similar 
conditions

police raided the home of black 
activist winnie mandela on sunday and said they took fingerprints 
and found traces of blood four of her bodyguards were arrested 
brig gen jaap joubert who is heading the investigation into 
the death of a 14yearold black activist who was allegedly abducted 
and beaten at the house said the fingerprints and blood samples 
would be tested 
police also took bags of clothes belonging to her bodyguards 
four of whom were arrested 
more than 20 policemen with rifles surrounded and guarded the 
house during the eighthour search 
police searched through mrs mandelas belongings but did not 
take any of them said a journalist at the scene 
joubert who directed the search is also investigating the 
disappearance of two young men last seen in the company of mrs 
mandelas bodyguards in november and the slaying of a soweto doctor 
who is reported to have seen the 14yearold boy after he was beaten 
police spokesman col lj haasbroek said two people had been 
arrested in connection with the doctors slaying but would not say 
whether they were among the four bodyguards detained sunday he 
would not elaborate 
the rev frank chikane generalsecretary of the south african 
council of churches said saturday that mrs mandela had decided to 
remove the young bodyguards from her home after receiving such 
orders from her husband jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela 
the raid came one day after a minister said mrs mandela agreed 
to remove from her home bodyguards accused of abducting and beating 
14yearold stompie seipei 
mrs mandela 54 is the wife of jailed african national congress 
leader nelson mandela he urged his wife to get rid of the 
bodyguards during her visit wednesday at a prison farm near cape 
town according to the rev frank chikane general secretary of the 
south african council of churches 
mandela 70 has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government 
major antiapartheid organizations in south africa have 
dissociated themselves from mrs mandela whom they accuse of 
complicity in the abduction and beating of the teenager 
mrs mandela smiling and cheerful came out to greet reporters 
during the raid and offered them refreshments she made no comment 
when the raid ended her secretary said she was resting 
mrs mandela formed the mandela united soccer club in 1986 
saying she wanted to provide recreation for youths congregating on 
streets but they grew into a organization of bodyguard who 
antagonized the community 
the anc has referred to the soccer teams activities as 
unbecoming whereas leaders in south africa accused it of waging 
a reign of terror in soweto 
the controversy over the soccer club came to a head last month 
when three men told a community meeting of 150 top antiapartheid 
activists that the bodyguards had dragged them to the mandela home 
and beaten them the men said seipei was with them but was hurt 
more seriously and was taken away after two days 
mrs mandela has said she was not home when the abductions 
occurred

a professional clown who admitted 
trying to pay a teenage boy to have sex with him has been given 
probation with orders that he continue therapy including punishing 
himself with ammonia or electric shock to inhibit such urges 
the sentence given friday to marvin matthow 56 who works as a 
clown at childrens parties was criticized by deputy district 
attorney karla hansen who sought a prison term because matthow is a 
twotime offender 
while in prison for a similar sex offense hansen said matthow 
advertised for boys ostensibly to serve as apprentices but 
actually to use for sex 
i dont think there is any way the court can ensure that young 
boys wont be victimized by this defendant again hansen said 
after court recessed 
district judge richard toth said the fiveyear probation term was 
proper because the therapy matthow has been undergoing is worse 
punishment than anything our prison system offers 
since november when matthow admitted asking a 17yearold boy to 
engage in sex for money matthow has been voluntarily under 
treatment at the behavioral medicine institute in atlanta 
his treatment includes sniffing ammonia or enduring an electric 
shock whenever he has an urge to have sex with an adolescent male 
at first the treatment was supervised by the staff institute 
officials say matthow has progressed to where he is allowed to 
inflict the punishment himself and document the punishment by tape 
recording it 
he is currently an outpatient at the institute under 
surveillance by institute staff who make sure he is acting normally 
institute officials said 
the technique is widely recognized for treating people who are 
attracted sexually to children said larry lanzotti the colorado 
springs probation officer who recommended probation for matthow 
atlanta psychiatrist alfred messer who is nationally known for 
his work with sex offenders said of the institutes approach 
its ok its a good program

in the aftermath of a landmark 2175 million 
jury award marc christian thinks about his former lover rock 
hudson and the question that haunts him still why did he do it 
why did hudson hide from christian the secret that went to bed 
with them for eight months that the movie star had aids 
i dont know why he did it christian reflected he took 
that to the grave with him i dont know if he just couldnt face 
the fact that he was dying a lot of people dont believe in their 
mortality when theyre famous you see your image up there on the 
screen and maybe he thought he would live forever 
or maybe he said hudson was used to having others handle his 
problems 
he had been a star since he was 23 everything in his life was 
delegated christian said in an interview i think he had some 
help in making the decision not to tell me but even if others were 
trying to influence him he should have been man enough to tell me 
christian 35 who sued hudsons estate and secretary for 
emotional distress was awarded 145 million wednesday and an 
additional 725 million in punitive damages friday 
born in hollywood and raised in southern california christian 
thought of becoming a baseball player tried being a rock musician 
and with his blond good looks dabbled in acting and modeling he 
was working on a music history project and volunteering in political 
campaigns when he met hudson in 1982 
he maintains that the actors fame meant almost nothing to 
him living in hollywood he had gone to high school with several 
actors 
fame for me was a turnoff he said i had met a lot of 
stars who were in love with themselves and i had no idea if rock 
would be shallow 
but the first time we spent in this apartment listening to 
music i almost forgot he was famous he was so really down to 
earth he made me feel at ease 
later when they became livein lovers he said i didnt think 
about the fame much sometimes it was fun to be caught in the 
afterglow of it we would go out to dinner and someone would ask him 
for an autograph 
his sweet memories turn bitter when he discusses what he now 
knows that hudson concealed his aids diagnosis from him while they 
continued to have sex 
hudson 58 died on oct 5 1985 three months after the public 
and christian learned he had the deadly sexually transmittable 
disease 
he made a tragic decision not to tell me said christian 
aside from that he was a very nice generous man but its 
outrageous i really resent the fact he didnt tell me 
christian has tested negative for exposure to the aids virus but 
said he fears contracting the disease if im carrying aids im 
dead he said if i dont come down with it he has put me 
through three years of hell 
he has been celibate since he learned of hudsons diagnosis he 
said 
he said filing suit was traumatic i initially asked the estate 
for 300000 christian recalled i said if i get aids i have

tarin kot is 60 miles from the nearest key highway and has little 
strategic importance but its capture would bring to six the number 
of provincial capitals to fall to the insurgents since soviet forces 
began leaving afghanistan on may 15 
the guerrillas are said to control 90 percent of the countryside 
but najibs troops still hold most urban centers 
more troops tanks and armored personnel carriers appeared on

security staff at londons heathrow airport began 
searching for a bomb hidden in a radiocassette player on nov 22 
one month before such a device destroyed pan am flight 103 the 
sunday telegraph reported 
the transport department had warned airline security staff to 
look for a japanesemade radiocassette player containing sheets of 
the powerful czechmade explosive semtex the newspaper said 
it cited only unidentified sources at heathrow for its report 
it said the warning came after police in west germany raided 16 
houses and apartments occupied by suspected radical palestinians on 
oct 27 and found an air pressureactivated bomb hidden in a radio 
police investigating the dec 21 explosion of the boeing 747 said 
last week they believe a radiocassette player hid explosives that 
blew up the plane over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people 
aboard and 11 on the ground 
on friday the transport department publicly advised all airlines 
using british airports to examine passengers radios computers or 
other electronic or electrical equipment for possible bombs 
a spokesman said the recommendation was aimed mainly at 
batteryoperated transistor radios laptop computers and cassette 
recorders in which explosives could be hidden rather than smaller 
electrical items such as hair dryers 
the sunday telegraph said that following the transport 
departments fall warning security technicians at heathrow built a 
replica of the suspected device and used it to train staff 
it quoted unidentified sources at heathrow as saying the 
transport department memo warned of a toshiba beat bomb player 
which would have two different types of batteries but would not 
play 
it would have two actuating devices the first a timer which 
would activate the second a barometric device the newspaper 
said this would detonate the explosives once the aircraft reached 
a predetermined height 
a transport department spokesman said sunday we dont comment 
on advice we give to airlines and all were saying is as with all 
warnings the threat was assessed and appropriate advice issued to 
the industry

the national weather service is facing a 
shortage of money and a reorganization that could lead to the 
closing of many local weather offices over the next several years 
the money available for the current fiscal year likely wont 
cover costs and the budget under discussion for next year could be 
even worse 
at the same time administrators are trying to complete a 
longrange reorganization plan aimed at consolidating offices 
through the use of new electronic equipment 
the weather service currently has nearly 250 local offices across 
the country and administrators hope to keep most of them running for 
at least the next few years while automated observation equipment 
can be purchased and installed 
then closings could be phased in gradually perhaps taking as 
long as a decade according to agency officials 
but the budget crunch is more immediate 
the current fiscal year is expected to end with the weather 
service short between 10 million and 28 million the shortfall has 
prompted a hiring freeze and a search for other savings according 
to several national oceanic and atmospheric administration officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noaa spending proposed by former president reagan for fiscal 
1990 meanwhile was set at 114 billion down from 119 billion 
in the current fiscal year 
while the national weather services portion of the noaa budget 
increases slightly under the budget that includes money to buy new 
radar and observation equipment and a supercomputer 
according to congressional sources the reagan proposal called 
for closing as many as 62 local weather offices this year and 77 
more next year as part of a consolidation move that would shift many 
specialized forecasting tasks to private weather services 
congressional sources said the bush administration may be 
reconsidering whether such sharp cuts are needed and that 
discussions are underway to keep the local weather offices open for 
the time being anyway 
warren kane of the senate appropriations subcommittee that 
oversees noaa said that some closings may occur in any case where 
stations are located fairly close together 
once new automated equipment is in place more extensive office 
closings will be easier to defend because weather forecasting would 
not be hindered noaa officials say but that would occur over 
several years perhaps as long as a decade 
the national weather service employees organization has said that 
the longterm closings could affect 100 offices or more and noaa 
officials privately admit that after the reorganization is complete 
they expect to have fewer than 150 local offices instead of the 
nearly 250 today 
the longterm weather service modernization plan was scheduled to 
be sent to congress this week but has been delayed partly because 
of the change in administrations which has caused confusion over who 
will be in top policymaking decisions at the commerce department 
concerned members of the house and senate who want some answers 
about the direction the weather agency is going complained that 
they dont know who at commerce to call for hearings

former president richard nixon says that 
president bush has the chance to effect a seachange in the 
ussoviet relationship but should beware of moving incautiously 
or giving too much away to the kremlin 
nixon who dealt with thensoviet leaders nikita s khrushchev 
and leonid i brezhnev has also met with president mikhail s 
gorbachev describing him as in a class of his own he is their 
match in tenacity and forcefulness but outstrips them in realism 
quickness and intelligence 
we must keep in mind that his talent and capabilities can just 
as easily make the world a more dangerous place as they can 
contribute to greater global security nixon wrote of gorbachev in 
the current edition of the magazine foreign affairs 
while his reforms give reason for a reappraisal of the wests 
policy toward the soviet union we must bear in mind that the causes 
of the cold war moscows domination of eastern europe and 
aggressive foreign policies around the world still endure nixon 
wrote 
those who parrot today a fashionable slogan the cold war is 
over trivialize the problems of western security wrote nixon 
who was forced to resign as president in august 1974 during the 
watergate scandal 
we must make gorbachev choose between a less confrontational 
relationship with the west and the retention of his imperial control 
over eastern europe between a continuing race in arms technology 
and arms control agreements that could create a stable strategic and 
conventional balance and between access to western credits and 
continuing soviet adventures in the third world nixon wrote 
in the 20page article nixon offered a host of suggestions for 
bush 
key among them were a proposal to meet early with the heads of 
us allies to formulate joint arms and trade policies toward the 
soviet union before agreeing to a summit with the kremlin chief 
gorbachev needs a summit far more than the president said 
nixon 
it is imperative the former president wrote that bush and 
the other leaders of the industrialized democracies issue a joint 
statement in conjunction with joint arms control proposals that 
educates their publics on the nature and scope of the soviet 
threat 
nixon had some harsh words for former president reagan because of 
proposals that reagan endorsed at the iceland summit in 1986 for the 
eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons and the strategic arms 
reduction treaty now under negotiation 
the danger in the draft treaty wrote nixon is that it reduces 
the number of us targets more drastically and quickly than it cuts 
soviet landbased intercontinental ballistic missiles which are 
first strike weapons 
bush has suspended those negotiations pending review of all us 
strategic policies and white house national security adviser brent 
scowcroft a nixon aide has made statements similar to those in the 
foreign affairs article 
nixon wrote that bush must repeat his formulation that progress 
in reducing nuclear arsenals be linked to reducing the sizable 
soviet edge in conventional forces 
the american president should demand that any treaty require 
sharp cuts in heavy soviet icbms and at the same time move ahead 
with deployment of a singlewarhead us icbm such a step would 
reduce the number of soviet warheads and launchers while increasing 
the number of us targets producing greater stability nixon 
maintained 
nixon also urged the administration to continue the support of 
anticommunist guerrillas in afghanistan nicaragua and angola and 
to press gorbachev to withdraw soviet support for prokremlin 
regimes in those nations

a pipeline in siberia leaked a huge mushroomshaped 
cloud of lethal flammable gas that threatened two villages but a 
helicopter crew exploded the cloud before it injured anyone pravda 
reported sunday 
the communist party daily said the poisonous and explosive 
fog was detonated by a rescue crew in an mi8 helicopter who fired 
a flare pistol into it that touched off a thunderous explosion and 
a fire that shot more than 300 feet into the air and measured nearly 
2000 feet in diameter the paper said 
prvada said no one happened to be in the vicinity of the fire 
which eventually burned out itself 
the leak in the pipeline carrying pressurized propane ethane 
hexane and other light hydrocarbons from siberia to the volga region 
of central russia took place tuesday night pravda said 
when the gas which was liquified at a pressure of 75 pounds per 
square inch escaped from the pipeline it turned into a 
mushroomshaped cloud ready to explode at any second pravda 
said 
noticing a sharp drop in pressure the pipeline crew shut down 
all compressor stations on the pipeline within 10 minutes and the 
helicopter set off to look for the poisonous cloud the paper said 
its crew found a white fog suspended in the air 120 miles from 
the city of tobolsk which is 1200 miles east of moscow in western 
siberia 
the cloud threatened a railway station and two small villages so 
the helicopter crew decided to detonate it pravda said for many 
kilometers it became as light as in broad daylight it said 
fire engines bulldozers excavators tractors and more than 30 
workers set off from the petroleum center of tyumen 150 miles 
southwest of tobolsk for the site of the explosion according to 
pravda 
by the time they arrived the fire had subsided and it died out 
completely a day later the newspaper said 
it said the damaged section of the pipeline was replaced

a selfdescribed monster a thrill 
killer at 15 whose reputation is that of new yorks most dangerous 
inmate is defending himself at his attempted murder trial and 
trying to put the system on trial 
willie bosket jr charged with stabbing a prison guard is 
shackled hand and foot in court but when he sits down at the defense 
table he flashes a smile at reporters and surveys the scene before 
turning his attention to the neatly prepared files on his desk 
hes not proclaiming innocence he admitted in opening arguments 
that he stabbed the guard 
articulate and intelligent at the trial bosket said he hopes his 
appearance will focus attention on problems he perceives within the 
states legal system he says he stabbed the guard to retaliate 
against injustices committed against him in prison but the 
prosecutor calls him a master manipulator 
each and every day i stand in this courtroom i laugh at this 
system because there aint a damn thing that it can do to me except 
to deal with the monster that it has created bosket said in his 
opening statement 
courtrooms are nothing new for bosket 26 who has been shuffled 
in and out of the legal system since he was 9 years old 
im a monster thats come back to haunt this system and i will 
dog this system until it is in its grave bosket promised in 1987 
at the time the guard was stabbed at the shawangunk correctional 
facility on april 16 1988 bosket was serving 25 years to life for 
assault arson and being a persistent felon he also had three years 
remaining to serve on a previous conviction 
in 1978 at age 15 bosket prompted legislators to change the way 
the state treats violent juveniles when he murdered two men and 
injured another in an eightday crime spree 
he told authorities he did it for the experience new york 
city mayor edward koch called him a willful maddog killer 
bosket was tried as a juvenile and sentenced to only five years 
but later that year bowing to public pressure thengov hugh carey 
and the legislature enacted tougher juvenile laws that allow 
teenagers under 16 to be tried as adults for violent crimes 
bosket grew up in harlem the product of a broken home he never 
knew his father willie bosket sr who graduated phi beta kappa 
from the university of kansas while a federal prison inmate and 
eventually died in an escape attempt 
he once boasted to a detective that he had a record of robbery 
arrests that began when he was 9 by age 10 he had been convicted 
of attacking a younger child with a knife and sent to a detention 
center at age 12 bosket was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as an 
emotional zombie 
after the guard was stabbed a special box cell was built for 
bosket at the woodbourne correctional facility in sullivan county 
his meals are slipped in through a slot cut into iron bars 
television cameras monitor his every move 24 hours a day 
when bosket leaves his cell for any reason he must first stick 
his feet through a slot to be manacled and then his hands to be 
cuffed three guards watch him when he gets his daily hour of 
exercise alone in a small fencedin area the prisoners hands and 
feet remain manacled 
ulster county judge francis j vogt ruled that bosket also must 
remain in shackles during this trial his hands and legs manacled 
and linked to a chain around his waist 
in spite of those restraints bosket has conducted his 
crossexaminations with intelligent articulate questions referring 
to himself in the thirdperson he has strayed from a professional 
demeanor only occasionally smiling or chuckling to himself when 
something did not go his way 
he clearly has established intelligence and also knowledge of 
the courtroom chief assistant district attorney donald williams 
said during a break in the trial thursday 
im not surprised hes one of the most manipulative people 
ive ever come across williams added appearances can be 
deceiving 
when its all over bosket knows he will return to his cell 
where even the guards are forbidden to talk to him 
if convicted bosket could be sentenced to another prison term of 
up to 25 years to life which would have to be served consecutively 
to his present sentence

just a 20minute walk east of the spires of 
londons financial district and the dome of st pauls cathedral 
signs of england give way to the sounds and smells of the asian 
subcontinent 
the mosques wailing call to prayer drowns out the toll of the 
church bell swishing sari robes replace pin stripes and the smell 
of roast lamb and spice fills the air in brick lane the new 
world for britains latest immigrants people from bangladesh 
the first arrivals stepped off boats three decades ago and 
settled in the east end neighborhood like the jews once predominant 
in brick lane the bangladeshis have struggled to learn english 
find shelter and work and preserve their culture 
a century ago brick lane was an area of infamous squalor where 
jack the ripper stalked his victims 
its jewish residents began leaving after it was heavily bombed 
during world war ii now 160000 bangladeshis the single largest 
concentration in britain inhabit the lowbuilt houses and narrow 
streets 
they have built five mosques in a squaremile area and opened 
leather shops and grocery stores filled with chutneys and mangoes 
the bangladeshis also have adopted a higher profile in demanding 
their rights as moslems 
they want more segregation of boys and girls in public schools 
where their children are in the majority and government money for 
their private schools 
another issue these days is salman rushdies novel the satanic 
verses which many moslems say slanders islam 
not all support iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis call 
to kill rushdie and his publishers but they vociferously denounce 
the novel as an insult to their faith 
in many ways the issue is not about rushdies book said iqbal 
wahhab editor of the asian herald an englishlanguage weekly 
it was about the reassertion of moslem values onto british 
society which they feel have been ignored he said 
the bangladeshis have begun to think of england as home 
five 10 years ago our people sent all money to bangladesh and 
think im just working here said siraz miah a 28yearold 
whose tiny leather factory sits above a narrow staircase strewn with 
leather scraps 
now we think its our country now people have house and 
business now is better 
amid the acrid smell of chemicals his 12 workers stitch 300 
jackets a week on old sewing machines surrounded by headhigh piles 
of hide they are among the fortunate 27 percent of east end 
bangladeshis are jobless 
it was factories like miahs that prompted prince charles during 
a 1987 visit to liken brick lanes workplaces to sweatshops 
something must be done said the heir to the british throne and 
londons business community responded with 26 million in donations 
for projects to create jobs 
many of the earliest bangladeshis to settle in london were ships 
cooks who had few skills and came alone intending to return home 
someday 
families followed sometimes nearly a decade later because of 
britains tightening immigration laws and a community grew now 
their children speak with cockney accents 
we have heard that moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go 
to discos its worrying us what comes next said daslimali a 
leader of the east london mosque near brick lane 
others trust the collective identity forged in brick lane to 
teach their children 
nowadays lots of bangladeshis are here so our children know 
how we behave said taiyabur rahman 55 who came in 1959 to open 
the first bangladeshi travel agency in london as long as our 
children are with us they wont be lost 
but while life improves problems remain 
racist violence a threat wherever britains 800000 asian 
immigrants are clustered is acute in the tower hamlets neighborhood 
the tower hamlets association for racial equality says it 
received about 2500 complaints of racial harassment in 1987 mostly 
involving beatings and broken windows it also said seven asian 
homes were set afire 
brick lane still has a few reminders of its jewish past 
including an allnight bagel shop and the j minsky and sons textile 
store 
sidney minsky whose father started the business in 1902 eagerly 
shows a visitor around asian stores in old tenements 
the asians show you how a business can be run he said

members of the baltimore symphony orchestra 
return to the concert hall this week after ratifying a contract that 
assures a minimum 1040 a week in the 19911992 season and closes 
the longest strike in american symphony history 
by the end of the fouryear 46 million contract players will 
earn 35 percent more than the 770 weekly minimum they received at 
the end of the threeyear pact that expired in september unlike 
many orchestras the musicians in the baltimore symphony are paid 
for a 52week year 
the contract was approved late saturday by a vote of 787 
we think its an excellent settlement and it meets the players 
needs for parity with the orchestras of st louis and cincinnati 
said charles underwood the players representative in negotiations 
he referred to the musicians demand that their wages be on a par 
with those of orchestras they consider peers 
the new agreement reached after a 22week walkout was agreed to 
after an allday negotiating session thursday and approved friday by 
members of the bso board after 84 canceled concerts the orchestra 
will return to its home at meyerhoff hall for a performance thursday 
hopefully well be able to face the future and become a better 
and deeper institution said john gidwitz the orchestras 
executive director we will work so that this will never happen 
again 
the 46 million cost of the contract is in line with the 
financial plan of the orchestra and will be paid for by very 
ambitious fundraising he said 
ticket prices may go up modestly but we do not anticipate 
dramatic rises he said we want to keep them affordable 
horn player peter landgren said he had lost 20000 during the 
strike but said it was worth every penny because we have the 
satisfaction of knowing that we had to be dealt with and that we 
were not manipulated 
to help bring an end to the strike gov william donald schaefer 
pledged 161000 more state support for fiscal 1990 in addition to 
the 486000 already in the state budget proposed for next year

china is making plans to build its first permanent 
nuclear waste dumps in preparation for its first nuclear power 
stations an official report said sunday 
the first two dumps likely will be in zhejiang province on the 
east coast where a 300megawatt nuclear power plant is to start 
operating next year and in northwest china where nuclear weapons 
are tested china daily said 
the newspaper quoted pan ziqiang director of the safety 
department of staterun national nuclear industry corp as saying 
that all chinas nuclear waste has been put in concrete basement 
storage facilities good for only 10 years 
he said the plan is to move the waste to proposed new facilities 
of steel containers buried 15 to 90 feet underground 
most of chinas nuclear waste has been generated by the military 
but growing amounts are being produced by scientific labs hospitals 
and nonmilitary industries 
the startup of the qinshan nuclear power plant in zhejiang next 
year and of the 1800megawatt daya bay plant in southeast chinas 
guangdong province by 1993 will add substantially to the amount of 
waste produced 
the china daily did not say how much nuclear waste currently is 
in temporary storage the amount the new power plants will produce 
nor the planned capacity of the proposed new dumps 
in recent years china has decided to turn to nuclear power to 
compensate for dwindling supplies of coal and other fossil fuels 
which hamper economic development

some consumer activists are back to pushing 
nofault auto insurance but others think a more general overhaul of 
insurance regulation is a better way to go 
nofault emerged in the 1960s as a counter to rising premiums 
slow resolution of lawsuits and paltry payments 
fourteen states adopted nofault in one form or another but only 
three michigan new york and florida have the high barriers to 
lawsuits that characterize the pure nofault concept 
but a 60 percent premium increase in five years has made auto 
insurance an issue again california voters recently voted to 
require a 20 percent rollback 
it is in this climate that nofault is getting another look 
the idea behind nofault is that accidents are inevitable and 
that often as not who was at fault is difficult or impossible to 
determine under a nofault plan accident victims collect their 
medical expenses and wage losses from their own insurance companies 
without having to make a claim against the other driver which means 
a lawsuit if the other drivers insurer refuses to pay 
nofault does not deal with collision theft and other coverages 
some consumer groups believe an expansion of nofault coverage 
though beneficial should await abolition of the insurance 
industrys exemptions from antitrust laws mostly in ratesetting 
and on revision of state laws limiting competition 
the new nofault drive comes from a group called new start 
led by virginia knauer consumer adviser to presidents nixon ford 
and reagan the founders were james brown director of the center 
for consumer affairs at the university of wisconsin at milwaukee 
and a longtime nofault activist the rev robert j mcewen 
professor of economics at boston college

the consumer federation of america the national insurance 
consumer organization and consumers union on sunday released a poll 
of 1008 people in which 72 percent of respondents believed their 
premiums were too high and 41 percent believed them much too 
high 
fortyone percent supported elimination of antitrust exemptions 
for insurance companies with 26 percent opposed nofault insurance 
was supported 49 percent to 37 percent and government provision of 
limitedcoverage lowcost policies was backed 69 percent to 26 
percent 
stephen brobeck executive director of the consumer federation of 
america said auto insurance reform has become the consumer 
movements top priority 
 
end embargoed portion 
 
organizations close to consumer advocate ralph nader such as 
public citizen and congress watch are skeptics on nofault 
nader himself distributed a column on auto insurance earlier this 
month that never mentioned nofault but supported the rest of the 
agenda backed by the consumer groups pushing widespread insurance 
changes 
the most basic and longer term reform is redirecting this giant 
profitable industry toward loss prevention the constant advocacy 
for safer cars better bumpers lower repair costs from superior 
engineering safer highways and drivers nader wrote 
mike johnson insurance specialist for congress watch an 
organization often associated with nader said litigation 
really isnt where the major costs are 
thirtyfive cents of every premium dollar go to administer the 
system and nofault wouldnt touch that 35 cents he said 
roughly half of every insurance premium dollar is returned to 
claimants not all of whom sue and 15 cents goes to their 
lawyers studies show 
if all nofault means is people are being compensated less 
generously we can save plenty of money by cutting benefits 50 
percent said johnson no fault doesnt address the real reasons 
for the inflation in auto insurance costs 
bob hunter director of the national insurance consumers 
organization which he described as spiritually affiliated with 
nader said what we have now is a deregulated cartel fixing 
prices to protect its least efficient members 
abolition of the antitrust exemptions would favor the efficient 
whose administration costs less than 30 percent of premium income 
he believes 
a truly competent package of legislation would save 20 to 25 
percent of premiums through efficiencies of competition and better 
regulation but nofault itself would knock only about 5 percent off 
premiums he said 
there are only 60 actuaries in all the state insurance 
departments aetna has 120 said hunter an actuary himself 
if forced to choose between nofault and changing the regulatory 
scheme i would take the one that saves the money hunter said 
and leave nofault to later 
the american insurance association backs nofault as do many 
companies in michigan new york and florida it has reduced 
losses and stabilized premiums said spokesman dave snyder who 
called new start a welcome addition 
every economic study done by a legitimate economist has 
concluded that the industry is highly competitive especially in 
auto insurance with hundreds of participants he said 
brown said the differing consumer group strategies are merely 
parallel efforts in the same fight 
one of the chief virtues of nofault is prompt payment the 
naderite strategy does nothing to achieve that father mcewen 
said 
it also does nothing to discourage frivolous lawsuits which many 
companies settle for 3000 to 5000 just to get them out of 
their hair he said 
members of the association of trial lawyers of america are the 
lawyers who collect onethird of damage awards they win and have 
managed to keep nofault at bay in state after state with the 
argument that no one should be deprived of the right to sue 
under nofault said association president bill wagner of tampa 
fla accident victims rapidly see the economic power of the 
insurance companies used to deprive them of all their rights 
wagner believes the companies far from throwing money at 
nuisance lawsuits to make them go away resist too many claims too 
hard

law enforcement authorities from around the 
country will meet this week in quantico to compare notes hoping to 
fill in more missing pieces of the puzzle left by serial killer ted 
bundy before his execution last month 
the fbi will hold the conference at its national center for the 
analysis of violent crime 
one of the agents was with bundy prior to his death and will be 
sharing that information with law enforcement officials fbi 
spokesman bill carter said friday in a telephone interview from his 
washington dc office we have invited police officers from all 
over the country 
an fbi statement said the conference was being coordinated among 
interested law enforcement agencies who had been involved with bundy 
before his execution bundy died jan 24 in floridas electric chair 
for the 1978 slaying of sixthgrader kimberly diane leach of lake 
city fla 
the conference had been planned for quite some time to get a 
resolution on some of the cases that might be out there carter 
said 
the handsome articulate bundy a onetime law student who became 
the nations bestknown serial killer for years had cockily 
maintained his innocence in the string of killings for which he was 
a suspect 
but during his final days bundy confessed to the slayings of at 
least 23 women in four states and gave information that linked him 
to other killings some investigators have said they believe his 
real total is 100 or more 
in all bundy has been suspected at one time or another in 
killings in washington state oregon idaho utah colorado 
vermont new jersey and pennsylvania he was convicted of three 
killings in florida 
carter said special agent william hagmaier who is assigned to 
the center was present at bundys request at the interviews 
hagmaier had interviewed bundy several times in the past as part of 
the centers research into serial violence carter said 
salt lake county sheriff pete hayward said sunday that two 
detectives dennis couch and jerry thompson were leaving for 
quantico on monday and would be there all week 
couch interviewed bundy two days before his execution and at 
that time bundy claimed responsibility for eight killings in 
utah during the mid1970s when he was a law student at the 
university of utah hayward said 
we linked bundy to five of them but there was some comment 
that he was responsible for eight and were very much concerned 
which ones they are he said 
hayward said the detectives would mainly try to coordinate all 
of the information developed by other investigators to see if 
theres anything more that we can put into the cases we have open 
here 
carter said he did not know how many law enforcement officials 
would be attending the conference fbi officials in quantico did not 
return telephone calls from the associated press on friday

police investigating the murder 
of a young black activist detained four men at winnie mandelas home 
sunday and said they found traces of blood during a predawn raid 
there 
radio reports said the men served as mrs mandelas bodyguards 
this is a thorough search of the premises where the alleged 
attacks and assaults took place according to witnesses said maj 
gen jaap joubert chief of the investigation into the death of 
stompie seipei 14 the boys body with the throat slit was found 
last month dumped in soweto the sprawling black township outside 
johannesburg 
south african police released a videotape of their operation 
showing officers without gloves searching trunks of clothing 
leafing through photograph albums and collections of african 
national congress literature and lifting up what appeared to be 
bloodsoaked sneakers a knife and a pair of gardening shears 
the camera focused on spots on the walls of some back rooms where 
the detained men lived staterun radio south africa said the spots 
were spatters of blood 
three soweto men have said mrs mandelas bodyguards abducted 
them and the boy and beat them at the mandela house they say mrs 
mandela wife of imprisoned anc leader nelson mandela was involved 
mrs mandela 54 has denied being at home when the four were 
brought there but she has defended their abduction and said they 
probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged 
homosexual activities at the methodist church residence where they 
lived the church denies her allegations 
we have found fingerprints and blood samples which will be 
sorted out in the laboratory said joubert he said police will 
try to prove in court that members of the socalled mandela united 
soccer team who live at mrs mandelas home and act as her 
bodyguards assaulted the boy who died 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches told a news conference saturday that mrs 
mandela had decided to remove the young men from her home at her 
husbands instruction 
major antiapartheid leaders inside south africa and the exiled 
african national congress president have publicly criticized mrs 
mandelas association with the soccer team 
joubert said one of those detained during the 4 am raid was 
jerry richardson identified as team coach others arrested at the 
house were not named but radio south africa said they were mrs 
mandelas bodyguards 
joubert said police also arrested two other men elsewhere in 
soweto who will be charged with murdering sowetos dr abu baker 
asvat community leaders have told newspapers that asvat examined 
seipei after he was beaten mrs mandela said asvat was a witness to 
her charges of sexual abuse 
police also raided five other premises connected with mrs 
mandela including the home of a freelance journalist joubert 
said he did not identify the others 
the alarm went off and dogs barked as policemen entered the back 
houses at mrs mandelas home according to the film it shows mrs 
mandela her daughter zindzi and grandchildren in their bathrobes 
richardson was filmed in his underwear putting on his pants and 
shirt while a policeman asked him to identify men who ran away when 
the raid started 
state television broadcast those scenes from the film which 
police made available to foreign reporters the same day they do not 
usually release material so quickly 
law and order minister adriaan vlok has promised foreign 
journalists he will release any information on the case as quickly 
as possible which also is unusual 
the film showed joubert directing the search while mrs mandela 
went about her daily chores provided refreshments to journalists 
waiting on the front lawn she was heard chatting laughing and 
listening to nat king cole music 
police searched through mrs mandelas belongings but did not 
take any of them said a journalist at the scene

seattle a boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of 
hightech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new air force b2 
stealth bomber in order to save money according to a published 
report sunday 
the supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation 
suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a 
fictitious inspector 11 
the seattle times reported that an internal memo declared that 
boeing advanced systems had the testing of incoming fasteners 
curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into 
fraud in the aerospace fastener industry only suspect parts 
would be tested the memo stated 
among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by boeing 
were hightech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a chatsworth 
calif company called voishan a division of fairchild industries 
the newspaper said 
boeing advanced systems in seattle uses voishan nuts and bolts 
boeing is manufacturing classified parts for the stealth bomber 
made by the northrop corp 
two weeks ago 20 federal agents armed with search warrants 
seized 52 crates of documents test equipment and fasteners in a 
raid on voishan the newspaper said 
the agents were searching for evidence to support allegations 
made by three past and present voishan workers that no testing was 
done on the fasteners but the fasteners were given a stamp of 
approval by a fictitious inspector 11 
the times said tests done on highperformance titanium fasteners 
used to hold together everything from engines to airframes were of 
particular concern 
the newspaper also obtained boeing and voishan shipping 
documents that stated in the week before the raid boeing advanced 
systems received two shipments of more than 200 voishan titanium 
fasteners with test reports certified by inspector 11 
the times quoting an unidentified source said those parts were 
only two of many similar shipments designated for the b2 project 
last year 
according to a memo obtained by the newspaper a qualitycontrol 
manager at boeing advanced systems ordered the routine testing of 
incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped apparently to save 
money 
the feb 18 1988 memo directed at top managers of the boeing 
b2 program stated effective immediately routine receiving 
inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped only those 
fasteners identified as suspect will be suspect to test the memo 
said the company expected to save 53000 by reducing testing from 
march to october last year 
boeing spokesman paul binder confirmed that the memo was 
legitimate but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the 
b2 program 
the company said its own investigation into the safety of the 
voishan fasteners had turned up no problems the times said 
fairchild industries voishans parent company said last 
tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against 
voishan 
fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it 
shipped any unsafe fasteners and said boeing resumed fullscale 
testing of voishan parts two weeks ago after the voishan raid 
the task force made up of agents of the fbi the internal 
revenue service the navy air force and us attorneys office and 
a grand jury in seattle are looking into charges of fraudulent 
testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners 
boeing stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is 
cooperating with the task force it also said it has its own 
screening processes to test incoming parts

man its cold in north dakota so cold 
says byron chamberlain that the state should rename itself to 
manitscolda 
chamberlain a high school assistant football coach from 
sheridan wyo was declared the winner sunday in the billings 
mont gazettes tongueincheek contest to rename north dakota 
the gazettes contest was in response to a campaign by north 
dakota state sen tim mathern to rename the state dakota 
mathern said he wanted to dispel the notion that his state is some 
sort of arctic wasteland and blamed the north in north dakota 
for the misconception 
but gazette readers didnt buy that line as most of the 159 
entries in the gazettes contest zeroed in on the states propensity 
for cold winters 
there was darn dacolda zipdacoatup weardakotanhat 
saskatchacolda subtopia and for those who put things 
bluntly land of the frozen dead 
chamberlains firstplace prize was a oneway bus ticket from

a dance troupe from the soviet union is back on 
tour again with a new schedule of appearances after being stranded 
for two weeks when their financial backing fell apart 
the 59 members of the donetsk state opera and ballet theatre set 
out by bus saturday for a sunday night performance in north branch 
nj ending an unexpected twoweek stay at the belvedere hotel 
hotel front desk manager donald steurnagle 31 had tears in his 
eyes when he embraced each of the departing ukrainian performers 
ive been in the hotel business 10 years and ive never been 
involved personally with guests before steurnagle said after they 
left they were such good people they brought me gifts all the 
time i will miss them 
the ballet troupe had planned a 15city us tour 
but when the soviets refused to allow three wellknown dancers to 
join the company for its american debut performances us and 
mexican investors withheld 200000 in financial support saying the 
three stars had been promised 
that left the troupe of young relatively unknown dancers in the 
lurch and cast into doubt the future of their performances in such 
cities as columbus ohio and chicago 
while us benefactors scrambled to find backing for a new tour 
contributors donated food liquor and money the belvedere and the 
lyric opera contributed meals the lyric held a benefit performance 
trips were arranged to the national aquarium and the us figure 
skating championships in baltimore the united states information 
agency helped arrange a white house trip 
finally last weekend a new york concert management firm icm 
artists and the howard gilman foundation in new york announced the 
booking at north branch plus seven performances at new yorks city 
center to be followed by seven more performances in washington 
other cities have been added as well 
mikhail baryshnikov artistic director of the american ballet 
theater and a director of the gilman foundation and who lived in 
gilmans home after defecting from the soviet union in the 1970s 
offered scenery costumes and rehearsal space 
vladimir shukmeikim the troupes artistic director said 
saturday the dancers had dreaded returning to the soviet union under 
a cloud of apparent artistic failure 
i think this situation was so unusual and it would have been 
difficult to explain that it was not our fault but the impresarios 
who signed the contract he said 
at saturdays departure lyric president robert pomory shared 
embraces and kisses with the dancers and several of them threw him 
into the air in celebration of his support 
im their brother and mr pomory is their father steurnagle 
said 
its like i developed a whole new entire family pomory added

moderate afghan guerrillas unhappy 
with nominees for an interim government for their nation on sunday 
walked out of a meeting called to elect a president and prime 
minister 
qaribur rehman saeed a spokesman for a guerrillaoperated news 
agency said the special consultative council of about 400 delegates 
will meet again monday despite the standoff involving the seven 
afghan guerrilla groups based in pakistan 
four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hardline 
islamic fundamentalists who want to establish a strict 
fundamentalist state in afghanistan the three moderate groups want 
a more liberal state similar to the governments prior to the 
communist coup in 1978 
moderate factions walked out sunday and sources said even 
representatives of hardline guerrilla groups argued against a 
proposed government headed by ahmad shah as prime minister 
ahmad shah is a product of disunity not unity a guerrilla 
official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
shah is a senior political official of the hardline 
ittehadeislami guerrilla group 
we wont be part of this shameful government said a 
spokesman for the moderate national islamic front of afghanistan he 
also spoke on condition of anonymity 
sources who attended the council session said members of that 
group were among the guerrillas who walked out 
the nominee for acting president of the interim government is 
mohammad nabi mohammadi head of the moderate 
harakatiinquilabiislami guerrilla group 
the guerrilla groups are deeply divided over sharing power and 
the nominations of mohammadi and shah were seen as a compromise on 
who would lead afghanistan if its sovietback government collapses 
the soviets withdrew their last troops from afghanistan on 
wednesday and the guerrillas have vowed to overthrow the communist 
government of president najib 
on saturday saeed said a vote scheduled for sunday on the 
nominations was expected to be a formality because the council 
delegates were in agreement 
after sundays session however he said it was not clear when 
the vote would be held the council also is to appoint a cabinet 
the council which convened feb 10 was expected to conclude 
after the vote 
if the guerrillas seize power they would hold elections within 
six months to form an elected council or shura that would appoint 
a permanent head of state and ratify a government officials say 
outside the meeting site a pakistani police officer shot to 
death a fellow officer police officials said the shooting was 
unrelated to the afghan council session some witnesses said it was 
a vengeance killing 
as the guerrilla leaders began leaving the compound where the 
council meeting was held some stopped momentarily to watch as an 
ambulance removed the body of the slain police officer 
afghans and journalists milling outside the meeting fled for 
cover when the other officer opened fire 
he paced nervously in front of the body for more than 30 minutes 
and kept plainclothes officers at bay 
a superior then arrived and talked him into surrendering he was 
disarmed and fell to his knees and wept

the number of police has not kept pace with the 
crime rate in the district of columbia the murder capital of the 
united states and union officials are urging the mayor to hire more 
officers 
the homicide rate so far this year is terrible proof that we 
cannot wait gary hankins chairman of the fraternal order of 
police labor committee recently told mayor marion s barry jr 
the number of crimes reported in the city grew from 52431 in 
1986 to 61884 last year but the number of police remained the 
same 3958 officers 
the crime rate is growing even faster this year with 75 people 
murdered by last week putting the city on a course for 600 murders 
shattering the record 372 set last year 
the crisis prompted police chief maurice t turner jr to declare 
a crime emergency starting tuesday the chief city attorney 
frederick d cooke jr said the step would allow police to reassign 
officers without giving the 28 days notice required in an agreement 
with the fraternal order of police 
police blame crack cocaine for the upsurge in crime and say 
drugs are responsible for 60 percent of the murders this year and 
last 
morale on the force is at an alltime low because so many young 
people are being drawn into the lucrative drug trade say union 
officials 
this cant go on forever hankins warned theres no 
slowdown in the drug trade and burnout is getting to be a real 
problem 
the number of police officers has dipped since the early 1970s 
when there were 5000 the number was 3958 from 1984 through last 
year rose to 4130 this year and was slated to increase by 200 by 
1990 
police chief turner says that the key is not adding police but 
intercepting drugs before they hit the street 
you can always use more officers but i think more officers 
will end up in more drug arrests turner said we have to attack 
the supply side because if we dont do that well get to the point 
where 20000 officers wont be enough 
city jails and courts are already clogged by drug arrests 
since the start of operation clean sweep against drugs in august 
1986 more than 45000 people have been arrested for drugrelated 
offenses city prisons are so overcrowded that inmates are being 
sent to facilities as distant as walla walla wash 
the city may have neither the money nor the means to increase the 
force rapidly the 1988 budget was 34 million in deficit and the 
number of officers eligible to retire is high 250 annually over the 
next three years 
it will take years to actually bring these recruits on board 
and for them to mature to a high level of effectiveness hankins 
said in the meantime well be losing officers

the election of former ku klux klan leader 
david duke as a republican to the louisiana legislature drew quick 
cries of dismay from civil rights organizations and a call for his 
repudiation by the republican party 
david duke is not a republican said lee atwater chairman of 
the republican national committee hes a pretender a charlatan 
and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he 
can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious 
bigotry and intolerance 
unofficial totals showed duke narrowly defeated homebuilder john 
treen in saturdays special election for a seat in the louisiana 
house duke registered with the gop two days before qualifying to 
run in the race treen is a longtime gop party official 
rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said in washington that if duke is 
officially certified the winner atwater will call a meeting of the 
partys executive committee to consider an unprecedented motion of 
censure against duke if passed it would preclude duke from 
receiving any type of aid from the party 
we repudiate him in his views and we will take steps to see 
that he is disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the 
official winner in saturdays election atwater said in a 
statement issued late saturday 
civil rights groups reacted with similar rejection of the 
policies espoused by the former grand wizard of the knights of the 
ku klux klan 
dukes election if verified is a gain for the forces of 
racism and bigotry said ai botnick regional director of the 
antidefamation league in new orleans anyone who believes he has 
changed also believes in the tooth fairy 
american jewish committee president theodore ellenoff issued a 
statement in new york saying while there has been significant 
progress in recent years in containing bigotry in america this 
development reminds us that there is much more work to be done 
arthur j kropp president of people for the american way a 
nonpartisan constitutional liberties organization called dukes 
election a victory for the dark side of american politics the 
politics of race his victory is a defeat for all who want to 
replace the ugliness of racism with a society that respects the 
rights of all

more than 10000 people at a sunday mass 
in southeast poland recalled the birth eight years ago of the banned 
independent farmers union and expressed optimism it soon will 
operate freely again 
government and opposition negotiators agreed in principle last 
week to legalize rural solidarity the union representing the polish 
countryside was banned along with workers solidarity in the 
december 1981 martial law crackdown 
solidarity and rural solidarity are separate but mutually 
supporting organizations 
today we are witnessing the beginning of a process in which the 
truth is becoming visible again bishop ignacy tokarczuk said in a 
sermon at the service marking the anniversary of the feb 18 1981 
agreement that legalized rural solidarity 
we welcome with cautious hope the understanding that it is 
better to talk than to fight he said 
the bishop said they were witnessing the bankruptcy of a 
political system without god 
he warned against being too trusting of authorities promises 
we have to talk but do not allow cheating he said we have 
the support of a united society which is pressing and demanding its 
rights 
at the end of the mass messages of support from workers around 
the country were read 
the huge modern church on the outskirts of rzeszow 190 miles 
southeast of warsaw was filled literally to the rafters with 
worshipers crammed into the staircase leading to its roof 
the moods are so radical that people demand that we prepare 
some kind of protest for them said artur balazs a member of 
rural solidaritys national council and one of the negotiators at 
the current talks with the government on polands future 
balazs and union chairman jozef slisz said they were preparing a 
draft of a new law about legalizing rural solidarity 
we have been talking to farmers for two days here and now we 
are drawing our conclusions said slisz it has been a good 
lesson for us we will go to warsaw and see what the effects are 
the farmers movement continued to function despite the ban and 
leaders said there has been a surge of interest in recent weeks 
more and more farmers are joining the union and there is a great 
revival of the movement in the countryside said slisz 
he said farmers councils already are functioning openly in 36 of 
polands 49 provinces and he expects the number to grow 
slisz said farmers worried most about the low prices they receive 
for their produce which he said has not kept pace with increases in 
the cost of seed fertilizer fodder and machinery

hundreds of sympathetic cards and letters 
are helping louise and john bundy emerge from the dark shadow of 
their serialkiller son but they remain upset over the celebration 
accompanying his execution 
i can go along with people believing in the death penalty but 
you cant be happy about it it isnt to be a joyous celebration 
mrs bundy said in the couples first interview since ted bundys 
execution jan 24 
in a story on the interview sunday the morning news tribune of 
tacoma reported the couple also has received some 400 cards from 
people who were moved by the suffering of the killers mother and 
stepfather 
this is just to let you know all people are not cruel and 
sadistic people my thoughts and prayers are with you all one 
woman wrote 
ted bundy died in floridas electric chair for the 1978 murder of 
12yearold kimberly diane leach of lake city fla some 
investigators believe he may have killed up to 100 people 
until her son started confessing to at least 23 murders in the 
days before his execution mrs bundy said she believed he was 
innocent 
when his confessions came out it was all like a blow right 
between the eyes she said this was not the ted we had raised 
we never saw anything to indicate it 
bundy was born in 1946 at a home for unwed mothers and the boy 
was raised partly by his grandparents mrs bundys parents 
during his first few years mrs bundy married john bundy in 1951 
and he then adopted young ted 
but mrs bundy said her son had a normal childhood and 
discounted her sons contention during his final days that exposure 
to pornography kept by his grandfather had affected him 
we did everything parents of the 50s and 60s did she said 
even down to reading dr spock 
bundy wrote his parents a final letter on the eve of his death 
saying in part nothing i can say can ease your pain it is a 
terrible thing i know but i have to try to make it right to tell 
the truth 
i do love you you were wonderful parents 
the night before the execution the bundys remained at home until 
midnight talking with ted on the telephone and with visitors the 
family went to a friends house at midnight and waited out the 
morning with about 30 friends and church members 
nobody had to call and tell us it was over we knew it she 
said along about 715 or so i guess it was 415 here i just 
knew that ted was all right i knew it was over i felt more at 
peace at that moment than i had for 13 years 
on the day he was executed crowds of people gathered outside the 
florida penitentiary where they waved frying pans and shouted 
burn bundy burn 
mrs bundy said she was angered by the comments of an 
investigator that her son was born to kill 
no beautiful child is born to kill he was not born to do 
that she said 
her husband john said he and his wife have been unable to 
determine why ted became a killer 
we talk about it and try to figure out down the line what it 
was like i say it was something he more or less kept under 
cover he said 
so far as figuring out why its not going to be figured 
out said bundy

evangelist jimmy swaggart struggling 
amid charges of sexual misconduct said sunday that his television 
ministry lost 15 million in january and still needs an influx of 
donations to stay on the air 
swaggart who declared war on pornographers he said are 
trying to destroy his ministry said last week that he would be off 
the air after feb 26 unless supporters provided enough money 
during his weekly tv program shown sunday swaggart said 
followers had responded to the plea but that more donations were 
needed to continue the broadcast to all areas 
on feb 26 if we do not continue to receive support we will 
lose some stations he said 
although swaggart did not reveal how much money had been 
received he said the ministry posted a 15 million loss in 
january a month he said is traditionally the worst month for 
television evangelists 
last month penthouse magazine quoted a new orleans 
stripogram dancer as saying she posed nude for swaggart a 
charge that he labeled sunday as a scam a lie from a to z 
catherine mary kampens story is similar to that of a new orleans 
prostitute who said swaggart paid her to pose nude for him an 
allegation that led to swaggarts ouster from the assemblies of god 
and a sharp downturn in the fortunes of his ministry 
on feb 21 1988 swaggart made a tearful confession to an 
unspecified sin from the pulpit of his baton rouge church 
i am not discounting any sin or mistake that jimmy swaggart has 
committed or made he said during sundays program so please 
understand that i have stood up as possibly no man in history has 
ever stood up and blamed no one but myself before the whole wide 
world 
but if satan succeeds in getting you to zero in on that and 
thats all you see then he will succeed swaggart said 
swaggart repeated his charge that penthouse published the story 
even though it had been given evidence that kampens story was 
false penthouse has said it stands by the story swaggarts 
attorneys have said a libel suit is being prepared

the known world population of one of the 
rarest plants in north america has increased more than tenfold with 
the discovery of about 100 of the endangered plants in the aleutian 
islands 
before the discovery of the aleutianshield fern plants last 
summer on adak island biologists thought only six of the plants 
were left on earth botanists examining plant life on the islands 
mount reed found the new pocket of shield ferns not far from 
previously known plants 
the fern is unique to two islands in the aleutians botanists say 
they believe it is a survivor from preglacial times living in a 
few mountain areas that escaped the glaciers the harsh climate in 
those areas and possible grazing by animals prevented the ferns from 
spreading after the glaciers receded they say 
the discovery has raised hopes the ferns will not become extinct 
biologists from the federal fish and wildlife service are 
studying ways to protect the surviving plants and help the 
population grow perhaps by growing the plants in a controlled 
environment said walter o stieglitz regional director for the 
agency

research shows a oncepromising aids drug that 
has become a popular underground treatment is unlikely to be 
effective against the killer disease according to a report 
published sunday 
oral dextran believed to be used by thousands of people infected 
with the aids virus does not appear to be significantly absorbed 
into the bloodstream apparently rendering it ineffective the los 
angeles times reported 
the preliminary results of governmentsponsored studies on humans 
and animals have been known to researchers for more than a month 
without a public announcement dr frank e young commissioner of 
the us food and drug administration told the times 
he said the decision to remain quiet reflected the preliminary 
nature of the data and his fears that an announcement could dash the 
hopes of people with aids taking the drug 
the japanesemanufactured drug had been considered a promising 
experimental therapy after studies showed the compound could prevent 
the aids virus from infecting immune system cells in test tubes and 
interfere with the virus ability to kill the cells 
but young said early findings that the drug is not significantly 
absorbed into the bloodstream suggest oral dextran does not have 
the promise of effectiveness that a lot of people thought and that 
we hoped prior to having this information 
dr daniel hoth director of the aids program at the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases cautioned that the 
results are preliminary and that it is theoretically possible 
for the compound to be absorbed over time 
officials at the institute and university researchers are hoping 
to better answer questions about oral dextran based on data now 
being reviewed from a sixmonth 60patient study of the drug 
i dont think there is any great mystery about why there has 
been no announcement hoth said we are dealing with scientific 
complexity and we want to make sure that everything is pulled 
together before making a strong public statement 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the bodys 
ability to fight off disease and infection there is no known cure 
but therapies using the drug azt appear to prolong the lives of some 
aids patients 
young said he felt compelled to answer honestly questions 
about the effectiveness of oral dextran as another treatment 
in the meantime he strongly warned people against injecting the 
drug directly into their bloodstream saying the practice could be 
very very harmful 
dextran a potent blood thinner can cause bleeding infections 
or severe allergic reactions when it is injected previous data has 
suggested oral dextran taken by mouth does not have harmful effects 
oral dextran an inexpensive drug manufactured by ueno fine 
chemical industry ltd of osaka japan has been sold in japan for 
many years as a treatment for atherosclerosis or fatty collections 
in the arteries 
the drug has been imported over the last two years by buyers 
clubs organized by people infected with the aids virus 
the fda has allowed aids patients to legally import small 
quantities of unapproved medicines for personal use against aids and 
other diseases

other peoples money at the minetta lane theater is a skate 
across the frozen pond of corporate takeover playwright jerry 
sterner guides the audience fast through the jargon poison pill

secretary the acting of mercedes ruehl who was in the film 
married to the mob nearly equals conways 
when larry the liquidator and kate meet both smart with savvy 
charm and wit the verbal sparks fly 
kate is hampered by jorgenson in her fight to keep the company 
from being taken over he is so principled that he wont use any 
ploy that harms the employees or the stockholders

away he refuses because he can make more by not going away though 
kate is working for hometown and mother its clear that the game is 
also the thrill

environmentalists across the country will 
fight attempts to build the nations first commercial spaceport at a 
site on the northern part of kennedy space center a florida 
activist warns 
this is one of those fallonyourswordanddie issues said 
charles lee senior vice president of the florida audubon society 
the state hopes to build a 58 million spaceport florida within 
three years at either kennedy space center or the adjacent cape 
canaveral air force station 
but more than a dozen environmentalist and civic groups plan to 
oppose any attempt to locate the spaceport on a part of the space 
center known as shiloh that is managed as a park by the merritt 
island national wildlife refuge 
if the shiloh site remains you will probably see opposition to 
spaceport florida on a nationwide level lee said 
building at shiloh would increase construction costs by 20 
percent but state officials prefer it because they want to avoid 
restrictions on funding and access posed by using a military 
installation according to chris shove director of the state 
department of commerces space programs office 
lee said letting public officials give chunks of parkland for 
commercial ventures would set a bad precedent the launch facility 
also would restrict public access to the wildlife refuge and 
canaveral national seashore and highly toxic rocket fuels would 
endanger nearby environmentally sensitive areas critics of the 
proposal say 
we all support putting it at canaveral air force station 
said reid hughes a volusia county environmentalist perhaps it 
would be best to eliminate the controversy now and drop the shiloh 
site 
state officials met with environmental and civic groups friday in 
orlando to answer questions and more meetings will be held 
if significant environmental impact is shown at shiloh the 
project will be stopped shove said but i dont think theres 
been any evidence of that yet 
under the shiloh plan the state initially would build one launch 
pad on a 50acre area as demand increased for commercial launches 
three more pads could be added he said

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
met sunday with king hussein and said he hopes to persuade israeli 
officials this week to abandon their stubborn stand against the 
arabs 
shevardnadze offered new proposals for advancing the peace 
process saturday in damascus the first stop on his 10day middle 
east tour 
he left amman for egypt on sunday night after a 7hour stay and 
told reporters that he would meet both israeli foreign minister 
moshe arens and palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafat in cairo 
he is also to visit iraq and iran before returning home feb 27 
from a trip that is pushing the soviet union closer to the heart of 
middle east peace efforts 
shevardnadze told reporters before his talks with hussein that he 
was giving the king a letter from soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
that touched on the middle east issue and the peaceful march to 
solve this question 
he also met separately with prime minister zaid rifai and foreign 
minister marwan kassem 
only through dialogue and convincing can one overcome the 
stubbon israeli stand shevardnadze said in a news conference 
before leaving damascus i hope i can convince him arens 
shevardnadze said in jordan that the plo and arabs had made great 
efforts toward an international conference the rest now awaits 
the israeli position we will discover it through our meetings with 
the israeli foreign minister 
shevardnadze is the first soviet foreign minister to visit 
jordan a country which historically leaned to the west 
asked on departure about resuming relations with israel broken 
during the 1967 arabisraeli war the soviet minister replied 
first let us convene the conference and then there will be no 
problems on diplomatic issues 
restoration of relations is an israeli condition for a soviet 
role in peace talks and the two nations recently began consular 
contacts 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir told israel radio on sunday 
that the meeting with arens would be a positive phenomenon 
he also said he would welcome arabisraeli peace talks under us 
and soviet sponsorship a plan suggested by former us secretary 
of state george shultz in 1987 
but shamir did not refer to the proposals shevardnadze revealed 
saturday night in damascus for a unsponsored middle east peace 
conference within six to nine months 
the soviet minister suggested the foreign ministers of the five 
permanent un security council states britain china france the 
soviet union and united states begin preparation for the 
conference 
they would then contact the parties involved and assume the 
function of a preparatory body for the conference 
the united nations as a whole also help the parties involved work 
out their differences he said 
but he told reporters in amman that no country can come up with 
a proposal acceptable to all parties from the beginning what is 
required a united effort to prepare an acceptable plan to convene 
and international conference 
therefore i say i do not have a special proposal in my 
pocket 
shevardnadze said in syria he had sent a letter to us secretary 
of state james baker before his tour and that he would meet baker in 
vienna on march 6 to coordinate stands on the middle east 
shevardnadzes tour is evidence of a growing soviet role in 
middle east peace efforts at a time that us action is largely 
stalled by the change of administrations in washington

a former principal accused of making 
racist remarks about blacks to white students acknowledges some of 
the allegations made by black teachers a school administrator said 
charles walker who is white resigned friday as principal of 
northeast high school because of a letter from several black 
teachers alleging that he told white cheerleaders that associating 
with blacks would degrade them and that black students are 
inferior to them because of their color 
mr walker confirmed some of it but not all of it in mr 
walkers opinion there was sufficient substance to render him 
ineffective donald hoover associate superintendent of east baton 
rouge parish schools said saturday 
hoover said walker acknowledged an error in judgment in calling 
the meeting with the white students but that the situation was 
not as dramatic as painted 
some of the things that letter said he had said are not true 
hoover added stating outright that blacks are inferior to whites 
mr walker vehemently denies that 
walker has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for 
comment he will be assigned to the school systems central office 
hoover said 
i think it was a good move to move him out of the reach of 
children people like that should not go into education in a 
multiracial system said g washington eames president of the

a realestate developer who recently 
purchased one of newports famed mansions has riled some of his 
neighbors by building a fence along the popular cliff walk 
joseph mele who paid 2 million for the mansion once owned by 
novelist edith wharton said he decided to build the fence because 
hikers on the cliff walk were crossing his property and leaving 
litter behind 
a number of residents have complained in recent weeks that the 
fence would force strollers onto dangerous rocks closer to the ocean 
than the present route of the walk which winds around several miles 
of the rhode island coastline 
the way hes pushing the walk out to the edge of the water 
hes putting peoples lives in danger said resident robert byron 
i really dislike it when people say that im taking something 
away when im putting something up on my own property said mele 
of washington adding that he has left plenty of room for hikers 
in some places ive left them 30 yards he said except 
for a couple of places i left enough room for people to walk side 
by side

the us department of energy is being so 
secretive about its uranium processing plant in nearby fernald that 
federal investigations and cleanup efforts have been hampered a 
newspaper reported sunday 
investigators from the us environmental protection agency and 
staffs of senate and house members have complained of heavy secrecy 
by the energy department the cincinnati enquirer reported 
the problem with these people at the energy department is 
that they think harry truman is still president and the cold war is 
still going on the newspaper quoted an unidentified senate staff 
member as saying 
the newspaper cited several examples of difficulties 
investigators claim to have encountered 
the energy department told federal and state epa investigators 
that documents they requested cannot be obtained but then provided 
copies of those documents to cincinnati lawyers suing the plants 
former operator nlo inc for 300 million 
ive never seen a situation like this said stan chesley 
lead attorney in the suit on behalf of people who live and work 
within a fivemile radius of the plant 
i assumed naively that every governmental agency cooperates 
with every other governmental agency theyre so used to hiding 
behind clouds of secrecy that they cant seem to come into the 80s 
and get the problems resolved 
rep thomas luken dohio an outspoken critic of fernald was 
told by the energy department that the federal epa had withdrawn its 
inspectors from the plant before telling the company now under 
contract to operate the plant westinghouse materials co of ohio 
that it had done so 
the energy department filed court papers last fall saying it had 
ignored and underfunded pollution control at fernald but did not 
tell westinghouse company spokesmen learned of the controversial 
filing which provoked widespread outrage and a congressional 
hearing in conversation with a reporter the enquirer reported 
westinghouse which is supervising cleanup said it finds its 
credibility dented when it is asked to comment on revelations it has 
not heard about 
the energy department denies secrecy over the plant is a problem 
in an organization as big as doe theres always an opportunity 
to improve communications but theres nothing deliberate going 
on said spokesman steve wyatt at the agencys oak ridge tenn 
operations office which oversees fernald 
critics say the energy departments resistance to sharing 
information ranges from embarrassing to dangerous cleanup cannot 
start until the agencies accurately account for radioactive and 
chemical waste at the plant 
the federal centers for disease control is awaiting a complete 
accounting of radioactive emissions from the plant during its 
38year history so it can begin its study of possible health effects 
on workers and neighbors of the plant

authorities arrested two people on charges they tried 
to give topsecret nato documents to the soviet union including 
information on a new computer system that can direct an entire 
battle news reports said sunday 
the arrests broke one and perhaps two kgb operations the reports 
said 
it could be the biggest counterespionage operation in europe 
in recent years said romes la repubblica 
prosecutors and police confirmed two people were arrested for 
espionage but refused to give details saying the investigation was 
continuing 
the italian news agency agi reported sunday the arrests ended two 
separate kgb operations in italy 
the reports about the affair carried by newspapers and the 
staterun rai television identified those arrested as giorgio 
stancich an electronics technician living in yugoslavia and 
natalino francalanci a fur dealer from pontedera near pisa 
francalanci 51 was arrested feb 11 in the ligurian port city 
of la spezia stancich 42 was arrested thursday near the adriatic 
port of trieste the reports said 
newspapers said francalanci traveled often to eastern europe on 
business rai said his arrest was in connection with nato research 
on antisubmarine warfare 
agi said that francalanci was linked to an alleged soviet effort 
to procure information about the making of fiber optics for industry 
and the military 
stancich worked for iret a joint italianyugoslavian firm in 
trieste that manufactures electronic communications systems for 
civilian and military use the reports said he commuted to work 
from skofje just across the border in yugoslavia where he lives 
the reports said stancich was arrested while trying to cross the 
border with documents related to a highly advanced electronic 
warfare project known as catrin said to be one of the most 
sophisticated systems of its kind and destined for use by nato 
the project still under development involves computer systems 
capable of directing activity on an entire battefield including 
ground and air operations the reports said 
milans corriere della sera reported that the operation was 
coordinated across the yugoslav border by kgb agents apparently 
working without the knowledge of the yugoslav government the 
newspaper quoted unidentified sources as identifying one agent as a 
former tass news agency correspondent in rome 
rai said the classified information was to have been sent from 
yugoslavia to kgb agents in austria 
agi said that in the other operation the kgb was seeking to 
obtain information on the technology used by otomelara a la spezia 
firm that makes fiber optics 
it said italian agents posing as suppliers of information 
discovered that two italians had been bringing information about the 
technology to the kgb in vienna 
agi said the two italians were francalanci and another man who 
had escaped to another unidentified country

about 200 black prisoners in natal 
province are refusing to eat until they receive the same sort of 
attention that authorities gave another group of fasting inmates 
lawyers said sunday 
the natal province prisoners have been on a hunger strike since 
last week and their attorneys say they are trying to arrange a 
meeting with law and order minister adriaan vlok 
vlok last week met with another group of civil rights lawyers 
representing about 200 other hunger strikers in the cape and 
transvaal provinces vlok agreed to free a number of detainees in 
the next two weeks 
both groups whose members are being held without charges under 
state of emergency regulations began hunger strikes to demand that 
they either be freed or charged 
but lawyers for the natal province hunger strikes in a 
statement said they are unsure whether vloks promise applies to 
their group 
the attorneys said about 200 detainees are on a hunger strike in 
the westville prison in durban the prison at pietermaritzburg and 
in police cells throughout the province 
a total of about 300 prisoners initially went on a hunger strike 
three weeks ago to protest their jailing some subsequently ended 
their strike and others joined it they are represented by two 
groups of lawyers and it was difficult to determine how many remain 
on a hunger strike 
more than 20 hunger strikers have been hospitalized prompting 
vlok to hold meetings last week with lawyers clergymen and 
relatives of about 200 detainees 
for the first time he received information other than that 
supplied by his policemen on why certain people were considered a 
danger to the community 
vlok said saturday that in the future he would assign a senior 
police officer to investigate factors such as family circumstances 
the detainees attitudes and his job possibilities so that those 
things can be considered in deciding whether a detainee should be 
freed 
monitoring groups have said more than 30000 people mostly 
black have been detained for some period of time during the state 
of emergency which permits indefinite incarceration without charges 
or trial 
vlok has never given a total figure but the periodic reports he 
must make to parliament have added up to approximately 30000 he 
said two weeks ago that there were fewer than 1000 people in 
detention at that time 
the national state of emergency was declared on june 12 1986 
and some of the hunger strikers have been held without charge since 
then

irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
sunday rejected the apology of british writer salman rushdie and 
exhorted moslems around the world to send him to hell for his 
novel the satanic verses 
in a statement issued by the official islamic republic news 
agency khomeini said the imperialist foreign mass media are 
falsely alleging that officials of the islamic republic said that if 
the author of the satanic verses repents the execution order 
against him would be abolished this is denied 100 percent 
even if salman rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man 
of time it is incumbent on every moslem to employ everything hes 
got his life and wealth to send him to hell khomeini was quoted 
as saying 
khomeini patriarch of the islamic revolution last week 
sentenced rushdie to death for his novel which moslems say insults 
islam 
but iranian president ali khamenei allied with socalled 
pragmatists led by parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani sought to 
defuse the crisis friday by saying rushdies life would be spared if 
he apologized and repented 
rushdie in hiding under the guard of scotland yard issued an 
apology saturday 
khomeinis latest statement appeared to leave no room for a 
negotiated settlement of the issue which has put britains newly 
restored relations with iran in jeopardy 
a bounty of 52 million has been put on rushdies head by 
iranian religious leaders since khomeini issued the death sentence 
in his message sunday khomeini also called on nonmoslems to 
help carry out the death sentence against rushdie 
if a nonmoslem becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the 
ability to execute him quicker than a moslem it is incumbent on 
moslems to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action the 
statement said 
neither khomeinis statement nor irna referred to the presidents 
offer of a reprieve reflecting a widening rift in the iranian 
hierarchy over the rushdie affair 
in london a spokesman for the british foreign office said we 
heard of this report with great concern we shall be considering 
carefully its implications 
this subject will of course be discussed in brussels by the 
foreign affairs council on monday when foreign secretary sir 
geoffrey howe is to raise the issue the spokesman said he spoke on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with british practice 
the 41yearold rushdie born to a moslem family in india has 
not been seen in public since thursday two days after khomeinis 
first decree 
in his apology issued through an agent rushdie said as author 
of the satanic verses i recognize that moslems in many parts of 
the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel i 
profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to 
sincere followers of islam 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes their religion by 
portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggesting that he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather 
than receiving it directly from god 
the satanic verses is banned in iran india pakistan 
bangladesh egypt and south africa 
publishers in france west germany greece and turkey have 
decided not to publish the book and some bookstore chains in the 
united states have pulled it from their shelves 
in new york sunday a spokesman said cardinal john j oconnor 
criticized both the satanic verses and those who threaten its 
author and implied catholics should avoid reading the novel 
he oconnor encourages everyone not to dignify the 
publication of this work which has been viewed by moslems as highly 
sacrilegious and offensive said msgr peter finn a spokesman for 
the cardinal 
in canada the government decided to allow entry of the book 
after a review determined it was not hate propaganda as defined 
by canadian law national revenue minister otto jelinek announced 
canada had blocked imports of the book after receiving a complaint 
from a moslem group 
the european conference of foreign press associations sunday 
called khomeinis order an act of terrorism against freedom of 
conscience of religion and of opinion values which are held to be 
the truest expression of a civil and more human world 
representatives of the group in rome for a threeday meeting 
sent a telegram to the iranian ambassador to italy and to the holy 
see 
in yugoslavia the leading communist party daily began printing 
excerpts of the satanic verses in its early monday edition 
the printing of the excerpts in the daily borba coincides with 
the arrival monday of khamenei on a threeday visit to yugoslavia 
the iranian presidents first official trip to a european country

lebanons top moslem and christian religious 
leaders arrived in kuwait on sunday for talks aimed at ending the 
14yearold lebanese civil war and avoiding permanent partition of 
the country 
the talks to begin monday were organized by the sevenmember 
arab league committee charged with seeking a settlement of the 
political crisis that has left lebanon without a president for the 
past 147 days 
the leaders arriving from beirut sunday were maronite catholic 
partriarch nasrallah sfeir greek catholic patriarch maximos hakim 
sunni moslem grand mufti sheik hassan khaled the acting chairman of 
the supreme shiite moslem council sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin 
and the supreme religious judge of the druse community sheik mursel 
nasr 
the greek orthodox patriarch of antioch ignatius hazim spiritual 
leader of an estimated 300000 lebanese flew from his home in the 
syrian capital damascus 
they were met by kuwaiti foreign minister sheik sabah ahmed who 
heads the arab league panel also on the panel are the foreign 
ministers of jordan the united arab emirates tunisia sudan and 
algeria and the leagues secretarygeneral chedli klibi 
before his departure patriarch sfeir appealed to lebanese army 
commander gen michel aoun and christian militia leader samir geagea 
to avoid a recurrence of the clash between their forces last week 
that shook lebanons christian heartland aoun and geagea are both 
maronites 
police said 76 people were killed and 200 wounded during two days 
of fierce fighting between aouns 20000 christian regular soldiers 
and the 6000 iregulars of geageas lebanese forces militia the 
christians main force in the civil war with moslems 
the first stage of the talks was held in tunisia last month when 
the committee probed the crisis separately with aoun who heads the 
christian cabinet in lebanons dual government and with his sunni 
rival acting prime minister salim hoss 
the two governments emerged when president amin gemayel appointed 
aoun prime minister of a caretaker military cabinet on sept 22 
minutes before his 6year term ended parliament was unable to 
convene to elect a successor 
moslems rejected aouns appointment contending it violated an 
unwritten national covenant dating to lebanons independence from 
france in 1943 this covenant gave the premiership to the sunnis 
the paliamentary speakership to the shiites and the presidency to 
the maronites 
lebanon has been divided into moslem and christian de facto 
cantons since the 1975 outbreak of the civil war that has claimed 
more than 130000 lives 
each enclave has been rocked by internal power struggles 
aoun who makes no secret of his hopes to become lebanons next 
president is pressing for an unconditional withdrawal of geageas 
militias from christian east beirut and all its suburbs as a 
precondition for peace 
geagea says he will withdraw if he gets guarantees that the 
syrian army and the iranianbacked hezbollah will withdraw from west 
beirut

relatives of pan am flight 103 
victims organized a committee sunday to push for a congressional 
investigation of the flights bombing and to step up airline 
security 
if we dont organize ourselves in an effective way it will 
be very difficult to go forward said paul hudson an attorney and 
former counsel to the new york state crime victims compensation 
board who started the network 
hudsons daughter melina 16 was aboard the jetliner when it 
blew up over lockerbie scotland on dec 21 killing all 259 
aboard including 35 students enrolled in a syracuse university 
program and 11 residents of lockerbie 
weve come to assist each other in our grief hudson said 
weve come to try to insure that there are no more flight 103 
disasters for the air and families 
seventyfive to 100 relatives many with photographs of their 
lost loved ones pinned to their chests attended the meeting at a 
restaurant to form the victims of pan am flight 103 committee 
last week officials announced that the terrorists bomb which 
destroyed the boeing 747 was traced to a portable radio stored among 
the luggage the plane was en route from london to new york 
besides giving support and aid to grieving relatives the 
committee will push for a congressional investigation of the 
bombing said bill ammerman whose brother tom was aboard flight 
103 
some committee members already have met with their local 
lawmakers including us sens daniel moynihan dny al damato 
rny and bill bradley dnj 
airline security procedures have not improved enough since the 
explosion hudson said it is far less than what is required to 
give confidence in the security of the system he said 
the group will campaign for stronger security measures including 
installation of devices that detect plastic explosives 
the families approved a resolution that calls for the resignation 
of paul bremer us ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism the 
group said bremer should resign because he has said airplane flight 
crews and passengers do not need to know about all bomb threats 
bremer said earlier this month that the state department will 
make sure any airline travel warning issued to government employees 
about terrorist threats will also go to the general public 
he told the house foreign affairs committee the american embassy 
in moscow violated policy in posting a warning about pan american 
flights from frankfurt to the united states 
the warning which was not made public came eight days before 
flight 103 was bombed 
it is not our policy to alert government officials and not the 
general public to such a threat bremer said at the time there 
is and can be no double standard 
but bremer said the threats should not be announced at all 
because it would encourage copycat terrorist threats 
the victims of pan am flight 103 committee want major 
international airlines to make public their policies regarding bomb 
threats

vietnams foreign minister said sunday 
that a delay in finding a settlement to the cambodian conflict may 
delay withdrawal of his troops from the country 
the best is a political solution but we must prepare for the 
worst if others dont want an early solution then we must be 
prepared for the worst nguyen co thach told a news conference at 
the second round of multilateral peace talks 
he repeated earlier promises that hanoi would pull out its forces 
by september if a political settlement can be reached by cambodias 
warring factions otherwise the withdrawal could be delayed until 
december 1990 he said 
since 1970 cambodia has suffered through a fiveyear war a 
reign of terror by the khmer rouge from 1975 to 1978 the vietnamese 
invasion on christmas day 1978 and a continuing guerrilla war 
millions have died in the land also known as kampuchea 
after years of deadlock the warring parties and their neighbors 
met informally in july in the first tentative step toward peace 
the threeday gathering that opened sunday is the second attempt 
to end the vietnamese occupation and push the tenuous negotiations 
toward an international conference on the countrys future 
the key players in the negotiations are vietnam the government 
it set up in phnom penh in early 1979 and a threefaction 
resistance coalition 
also attending the talks are reprsentatives from laos and the 
association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia brunei 
singapore the philippines and indonesia 
indonesia arranged the talks as aseans gobetween with its 
communist neighbors 
thachs remarks and a speech by prime minister hun sen of the 
phnom penh government appeared designed to put early pressure on the 
resistance coalition and their allies 
the position of the two kampuchean parties are still quite far 
apart hun sen said in prepared remarks 
postponement would only delay the vietnamese armed forces 
withdrawal and the supply of military aid as well as to only prolong 
the foreign interference into the kampuchean conflict he said 
the resistance coalition includes the khmer rouge by far the 
strongest militarily anticommunists led by former prime minister 
son sann and followers of former head of state prince norodom 
sihanouk 
sihanouk who heads the coalition boycotted the jakarta meeting 
because hun sen rejected his plans for peace hun sens own peace 
plan has been rejected by the other side 
sihanouks son prince norodom ranaridh told the news conference 
he was representing his father and would also function as spokesman 
for the coalition sundays opening consisted mostly of formalities 
and a dinner 
mutual consultations were planned monday morning with a plenary 
session in the afternoon

a strong earthquake hit the capital and much of 
northern japan on sunday killing one person and injuring another 
shaking buildings and briefly halting some train and airline 
service officials said 
the quake registering 56 on the richter scale hit at 927 pm 
737 am est said a spokesman for the meteorological agency the 
agency placed the epicenter about 36 miles underground near 
utsunomiya 60 miles north of tokyo 
the quake also shook all of northern honshu japans main island 
a stretch about 360 miles long but it caused no tidal waves the 
spokesman said 
a local fire department official said monday that shigeo ohikawa 
78 was taken to a hospital in matsudo east of tokyo after 
suffering shock he later died of a heart attack the japan 
broadcasting corp and kyodo news service said 
a 61yearold man also was injured after he was hit on the head 
by a falling vase at his home in ibaraki 63 miles northeast of 
tokyo a national police agency official said the man was taken to 
a nearby hospital for treatment said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
about 300 households in chiba state east of tokyo were forced to 
go without electricity for about 70 minutes after a power supply 
line was cut in the wake of the tremor the police official said 
japan railways officials said trains in northern japan were 
halted for about five minutes while local train service near 
utsunomiya was still suspended 90 minutes after the temblor 
officials at the new tokyo international airport in narita 40 
miles northeast of tokyo said they had closed the main runway to 
check for damage but after 13 minutes the runway was reopened 
subway trains in tokyo also were stopped temporarily including a 
twominute shutdown of the hibiya line which runs under downtown 
areas 
we checked to see if there was any damage said an official 
less than one hour after the quake but everything was all right 
and the trains are running fine 
in central tokyo the quake rattled plate glass windows for about 
a half minute shook clocks on the wall and made chairs wobble 
japan is in a very active seismological area and has suffered 
several major earthquakes in the past the biggest this century was 
in 1923 when about 140000 tokyo and its neighboring yokohama 
residents died in a quake and fires 
the richter scale devised in 1935 is openended with each 
digit representing a tenfold increase in magnitude thus a 66 
reading is ten times greater than a 56 
on the richter scale 50 can cause considerable damage while a 
60 can mean severe damage in populated areas

the roman catholic church on 
sunday urged guerrilla leaders and politicans to reach an accord 
this week that will bring peace in the country 
guerrilla leaders and representatives of all major salvadoran 
political parties are to meet in mexico on monday to discuss a rebel 
demand that the march 19 elections be delayed until september 
the rebels say they will recognize the legitimacy of the next 
elected government if the balloting were delayed and if safeguards 
against fraud were in place 
monsignor gregorio rosa chavez auxiliary archbishop of san 
salvador said the date of elections is one of the points of the 
guerrilla proposal most easily resolved 
our emphasis is this how by changing the date of elections 
do we achieve a complete guarantee that the war will end in by 
september if that can be achieved i think that not only some 
parties but the immense majority would say of course well change 
the date of elections 
the rebels have boycotted and condemned as sham the previous 
elections this decade 
the government of president jose napoleon duarte and the armed 
forces have all but ruled out acceptance of the guerrilla propsosal 
guillermo ungo presidential candidate of the leftist democratic 
convergence and a participant in mondays meeting told the 
associated press on saturday he did not expect much to come of the 
mexico talks 
a breakthrough would depend on unanimous acceptance of 
postponement by the political parties the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance which is favored to win in march has opposed 
postponement 
an estimated 70000 people have been killed in the 9yearold 
civil war between the leftist guerrillas and the usbacked 
government

a boeing subsidiary may have curtailed testing of 
hightech nuts and bolts destined for use in the new air force b2 
stealth bomber in order to save money according to a published 
report sunday 
the supplier of those nuts and bolts is now under investigation 
suspected of supplying substandard parts stamped as approved by a 
fictitious inspector 11 
the seattle times reported that an internal memo declared that 
boeing advanced systems had the testing of incoming fasteners 
curtailed just as a federal task force began the investigation into 
fraud in the aerospace fastener industry only suspect parts 
would be tested the memo stated 
among the parts that may have escaped routine testing by boeing 
were hightech titanium nuts and bolts manufactured by a chatsworth 
calif company called voishan a division of fairchild industries 
the newspaper said 
boeing advanced systems in seattle uses voishan nuts and bolts 
boeing is manufacturing classified parts for the stealth bomber 
made by the northrop corp 
two weeks ago 20 federal agents seized 52 crates of documents 
test equipment and fasteners in a raid on voishan the newspaper 
said 
the agents were searching for evidence to support allegations 
made by three past and present voishan workers that no testing was 
done on the fasteners but the fasteners were given a stamp of 
approval by a fictitious inspector 11 
the times said tests done on highperformance titanium fasteners 
used to hold together everything from engines to airframes were of 
particular concern 
the newspaper also obtained boeing and voishan shipping 
documents that stated in the week before the raid boeing advanced 
systems received two shipments of more than 200 voishan titanium 
fasteners with test reports certified by inspector 11 
the times quoting an unidentified source said those parts were 
only two of many similar shipments designated for the b2 project 
last year 
according to a memo obtained by the newspaper a qualitycontrol 
manager at boeing advanced systems ordered the routine testing of 
incoming shipments of some fasteners stopped apparently to save 
money 
the feb 18 1988 memo directed at top managers of the boeing 
b2 program stated effective immediately routine receiving 
inspection testing of fasteners is to be stopped only those 
fasteners identified as suspect will be subject to test the memo 
said the company expected to save 53000 by reducing testing from 
march to october last year 
boeing spokesman paul binder confirmed that the memo was 
legitimate but declined further comment on it or any aspect of the 
b2 program 
the company said its own investigation into the safety of the 
voishan fasteners had turned up no problems the times said 
fairchild industries voishans parent company said last 
tuesday in a statement that it is investigating the charges against 
voishan 
fairchild said there has been no claim from customers that it 
shipped any unsafe fasteners and said boeing resumed fullscale 
testing of voishan parts two weeks ago after the voishan raid 
the task force made up of agents of the fbi the internal 
revenue service the navy air force and us attorneys office and 
a grand jury in seattle are looking into charges of fraudulent 
testing and falsified documentation of aerospace fasteners 
boeing stated that it is not a target of the investigation and is 
cooperating with the task force it also said it has its own 
screening processes to test incoming parts

now a swiss citizen withdrew sunday from the seventh city of 
linares international chess tournament after organizers denied his 
request to exclude a soviet judge 
korchnoi told reporters he had sent a letter to the tournaments 
organizers saying he would not play if viktor baturisnky of the

soviet chess federation when he played anatoly karpov in 1974 two 
years before he sought asylum in the west karpov won 125115

partiality in the match in which he played karpov for the right to 
play bobby fischer of the united states for the world title 
korchnoi was scheduled to meet vasili ivanchuck of the soviet 
union sunday in the opening match of the 14day tournament 
i will only admit as a great concession that the organizers 
could make baturinsky a guest of honor but nothing more said 
korchnoi 
julio gallardo president of the linares tournament organizing 
committee said sunday he had not received korchnois letter 
luis rentero technical director of the tournament proposed that 
francisco mena of spain be the judge in the matches played by

korchnoi left for madrid after a onehour meeting between 
players judges and members of the organization who confirmed 
baturinskys position as main judge he said he felt insulted by the 
organizers

the only candidate to replace premier ciriaco de mita 
as leader of italys most powerful party said sunday he would not 
try to bring down the government 
arnaldo forlani is expected to be named secretary of the 
christian democrat party during its fiveday special congress which 
began saturday 
his nomination was seen as a major defeat for de mita who 
considers forlani too conservative to back his programs in 
parliament and a threat to de mitas 10monthold coalition 
government 
forlani indicated sunday that de mita would have to heed the 
wishes of a new leadership 
in a 1hour speech to party delegates forlani called for 
support for the government which he said had lacked steady backing 
as it tried to cut the huge public deficit 
the governments existence will never be threatened by 
maneuvers in the party forlani said 
but it is on the issue of an economic cure that the future of 
the government and of the alliance of governing parties rides 
he warned 
the party secretary is seen by many as the most influential 
politician in italy since the christian democrats have dominated 
every government for four decades 
de mitas candidates for secretary were defeated in party 
wrangling prior to the congress nonetheless the premier tried to 
ensure support for his programs by asking congress saturday to give 
his leadership a vote of confidence 
in his speech at a sports stadium in a neighborhood built by 
dictator benito mussolini forlani called for party unity and 
indicated the government would receive continued support if it stuck 
by the wishes of the party 
if we the christian democrats proceed united the government 
also will be at an advantage and can reinforce its actions 
forlani said 
de mita 61 from the partys left wing insisted on remaining 
party secretary when he became premier last april saying it 
provided the government with stability but many people that too 
much power was concentrated in de mitas hands 
forlani 64 who was premier in 198081 went into the congress 
with the support of the partys center faction believed to control 
about onethird of the 1312 delegates he also had the backing of 
the about 20 percent of the delegates loyal to foreign minister 
giulio andreotti 
after forlanis speech leaders of the partys left wing said 
they would not block his candidacy de mita was expected to be named 
party president a largely ceremonial post 
the christian democrats have been increasing their vote total in 
recent years after nearly being overtaken by the communist party in 
the early 1980s 
one de mita adviser former sen francesco donofrio admitted 
that forlanis nomination marked a defeat for the premier but he 
noted the positive result of having obliged the new majority to 
approve de mitas political line with a formal motion

seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from 
a towboat sunday on the ohio river and spilled an estimated 40000 
gallons of fuel into the river after striking a railroad bridge 
piling officials said 
recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had diluted 
said rich carter assistant chief of the ohio environmental 
protection agencys office of emergency response 
no impact has been observed thus far he said 
all other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw 
their water from wells or underground aquifers carter said the 
rivers speedy flow makes the spill unlikely to have much effect on 
water supplies or aquatic life he said 
the rainswollen ohio river crested saturday at 522 feet inches 
above flood stage and was falling sunday the spill posed the most 
immediate threat to the louisville ky water system about 100 
miles downstream 
gasoline tends to float on the waters surface and authorities 
said water systems served by the river could close their intakes 
until the gasoline floats past the spill occurred downstream from 
the intakes of cincinnatis water system officials said 
the barges containing leaded and unleaded gasoline were being 
pushed down river by the towboat mv super america from an ashland 
oil inc refinery at ashland ky to an ashland products terminal 
on the river in cincinnati 
ashland spokesman roger schrum and the coast guard said two of 
the barges were leaking 
officials at the scene said several other towboats helped 
recapture the loose barges carter said the leaking barges were 
being drained of their remaining gasoline sunday night at the 
ashland facility and at a standard oil co facility in nearby 
bromley ky across the ohio from cincinnati recovery of the 
gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted carter said 
the incident occurred about 945 am and river traffic was 
flowing normally by afternoon said coast guard lt chuck polk said 
the railway bridge owned by norfolk amp southern railroad was 
inspected and was apparently not damaged said herb nugent terminal 
trainmaster for norfolk amp southern the bridge is at ludlow ky 
within view of downtown cincinnati

the central bank ordered all 
monetary exchange operations suspended for a day monday when new 
exchange measures to encourage exports and fight inflation were to 
be announced 
the sunday night order affected only exchange operations the 
central bank said banks were expected to open as usual 
the suspension is aimed at facilitating announcement of 
modifications that will be made in the exchange market the 
central bank communique said 
the modifications will be announced tomorrow monday the 
bank said their objective is to increase activity on the free 
market and provide increased incentive to exports at the same time 
minimizing the impact of inflation 
the communique did not elaborate 
the bank said there will be no changes in exchange rates 
involving imports or for any commercial and special exchange rates 
the central bank communique followed a series of closeddoor 
meetings by president raul alfonsins economic team headed by 
economy minister juan v sourrouille 
in recent months the central bank spent more than 13 billion 
trying to hold down the dollar as a way to control inflation bank 
officials disclosed on feb 5 that they would discontinue that 
policy and ordered private banks and exchange houses closed feb 6 
a threetier system of exchange rates including official 
special and free rates was announced feb 7 
on feb 7 the dollar sold for 27 australs on the free market at 
the close of business the previous friday it sold for 1770 
australs the fluctuations continued last week at the close of 
business on friday the dollar sold for 2650 
the problem as usual was inflation which was an unexpectedly 
high 89 percent in january a rise from decembers 68 percent and 
novembers 57 percent 
in august alfonsin implemented a program of voluntary wage and 
price controls budget cuts and small regular devaluations in the 
austral 
to convince argentines not to put their money in dollars which 
deprives the banking system of funds and drives up interest rates 
the central bank made plenty of dollars available interest rates 
were kept attractively high though well below levels of july and 
august 
through november the plan seemed to work inflation and monthly 
interest rates both returned to single digits the dollar rose 
modestly and of crucial importance argentines purchasing power 
recovered from the months when it lagged behind inflation 
critics pointed out however that any improvement was illusory 
because it was obvious the dollar was undervalued and as soon as 
that was common knowledge speculators would buy dollars in 
anticipation of profits 
the bubble burst in the first week of february when argentines 
bought 486 milliod to near 20 percent a month

authorities were considering whether he should face charges in an 
irish court

belgian authorities in november refused a british request for his 
extradition and flew him home on a military aircraft accompanied by 
a prison doctor the irish government also refused to extradite him 
saying he would not receive a fair trial in britain 
the affair led to an angry exchange between british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and belgian prime minister dr wilfried 
martens at a european economic community summit in december irish 
prime minister charles haughey publicly snubbed mrs thatcher there

a controversial special relief program for 
nicaraguan immigrants is being dismantled and city officials say 
its time for the newcomers to fend for themselves 
you have to kick them out of the nest said martha torres a 
volunteer dispatching some of the last nicaraguans under city care 
to new homes 
the city had assembled two shelters to handle the more than 300 
aliens who were living in the bobby maduro miami stadium they were 
lated placed in more than 80 apartments across dade county 
by thursday city workers sent off the last people from the 
shelters and did not plan to reopen them again 
most of the immigrants placed by the city wont have to pay their 
own rent until midmarch and city officials said they wont be 
offered further help 
the assistance drew criticism from black leaders in the wake of 
last months disturbances in miamis black neighborhoods they 
claimed hispanic immigrants were granted special privileges from the 
city while blacks were relatively ignored and have always been left 
to fend for themselves 
critics of the citys recent decisions say the nicaraguans are 
unlikely to be able to become selfsufficient because most wont 
have work permits while immigration officials decide whether they 
will be permitted to stay 
these people have really been thrown to the lions said 
vivian correa a volunteer at st louis catholic church which is 
continuing to provide food for some families 
they have no papers no money correa said they have no 
way of getting a job 
while the immigrant migration continues to dade county it has 
diminished in recent weeks most new arrivals are being absorbed by 
family and friends officials said

us and european negotiators agreed over the 
weekend to a 75day cooling off period in their increasingly 
abrasive trade war involving american beef containing growth 
hormones as they intensified their search for a compromise to 
resolve the dispute 
us trade representative carla hills holding her first 
discussions as the bush administrations top trade negotiator said 
saturday substantial progress had been made in the two days of talks 
with representatives of the 12nation european community 
frans andriessen the ecs top trade negotiator said sunday the 
agreement could help the two sides resolve the meat dispute 
i dont say we are close to a solution but i think we are now 
in a situation which makes it easier to come to a solution 
andriessen said upon returning to brussels from washington 
the two sides agreed to establish a highlevel task force to 
study the issue over the next 75 days with the goal of coming up 
with ways to export hormonefree american beef to europe 
the task force will also consider an american demand that a panel 
of experts should be established to consider whether growth hormones 
constitute a health risk 
we made good progress in working out a procedure with respect 
to our differences in the hormone area mrs hills told reporters 
after the meeting ended we have a highlevel task force to deal 
with that issue to work out the differences if at all possible 
andriessen said talks with officials of the new bush 
administration gave him the impression we have a very positive 
environment for cooperation 
he said us officials still contested the prohibition against 
hormonetreated beef but they have accepted now that to ship the 
meat they have to comply with our requirements 
both president bush and european officials have expressed a 
desire to defuse the trade dispute fearing that the battle could 
aggravate tensions just at a time when the new administration is 
trying to forge closer ties with its european allies 
the current trade dispute began on jan 1 when the europeans 
imposed a ban on shipments of us beef because the meat contained 
growth hormones used to fatten american cattle 
the reagan administration charged that the european action which 
affected about 100 million in annual meat shipments represented an 
unfair trade barrier and that there was no scientific evidence that 
the hormones were a health threat 
in retaliation the americans slapped 100 percent tariffs on 100 
million worth of european products ranging from canned tomatoes to 
fruit wines and instant coffee those tariffs are just now showing 
up in higher prices at us grocery stores 
the weekend negotiations were held in an effort to avoid a 
counterretaliatory step threatened by the europeans on monday when 
the governing body of the european community will meet to consider 
imposing 100 percent tariffs on 100 million of american exports of 
walnuts and dried fruit 
andriessen said saturday he could not speak for the european 
council of ministers but he indicated that the progress made in the 
talks would likely postpone the second round of retaliation 
andriessen told reporters at a later briefing saturday the united 
states had indicated it would lower its 100 million in tariffs by 
an amount equal to the shipments of hormonefree beef that the 
united states is able to make 
he said consideration would be given to doubling the quota for 
highgrade beef last year the united states shipped 32 million 
worth of such beef to europe such a step would make it more 
profitable for us ranchers to raise hormonefree beef 
mrs hills and andriessen also reported progress between the two 
sides over the us demand to end all tradedistorting farm 
subsidies a position the europeans have strongly objected to 
a us official briefing reporters on the condition that the 
officials name not be used said that the united states offered a 
new proposal on the contentious farm subsidy issue and the matter 
was to be discussed by mrs hills andriessen agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter and ray macsharry the european communitys 
commissioner in charge of agriculture during talks on march 10 and 
11 in brussels 
the current round of talks being held to liberalize world trade 
known as the uruguay round have been stalled because of american 
and european differences over farm subsidies 
european officials characterized the getacquainted talks which 
also included commerce secretary robert a mosbacher as helpful in 
understanding the position of the new administration 
trade between the united states and the european community 
totaled 165 billion last year making the 12nation community 
americas largest trading partner 
bush referring to the beef dispute in his first address to 
congress said last week that the major industrial countries needed 
to rise above fighting about beef hormones to building a better 
future to move from protectionism to progress 
a basis for compromise on the beef question was put forward by 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
the texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle from 
birth through slaughter giving them tests for artificial hormones 
and establishing enforcement procedures texas officials say that 
similar programs meeting european standards have been proposed by 
brazil and new zealand 
american officials have been anxious to get the dispute resolved 
because the battle had raised questions about american beef 
the health ban is a signal that something is wrong with our 
beef mrs hills said last week nothing is wrong with our 
beef 
nearly half of american cattle are now treated with growth 
hormones the us food and drug administration has maintained 
throughout the dispute that the daily production of hormones in 
humans even in children is far higher than the miniscule levels 
left in meat from treated animals

a federal judge is being asked to declare illegal 
many of the secret tape recordings made by undercover fbi agents 
during a twoyear probe of suspected fraud at the worlds two 
largest futures exchanges according to reports published saturday 
the chicago suntimes and the chicago tribune reported that 
lawyers representing commodity traders are contending their clients 
should not be forced to hand over documents or appear before a 
federal grand jury because evidence against the traders came from 
improper recordings 
us attorney anton valukas and the fbis chicago office have 
declined to confirm that an investigation is ongoing into allegedly 
fraudulent trading practices at the chicago mercantile exchange and 
the chicago board of trade 
but traders who have been subpoenaed and their attorneys have 
disclosed some aspects of the investigation 
several defense attorneys said in letters to government 
prosecutors and in closeddoor arguments before chief us district 
judge john grady that many of the tape recordings made by fbi agents 
amount to unauthorized wiretaps the newspapers reported 
while at least two lawyers identified by the suntimes declined 
to confirm the filings that newspaper and the tribune quoted 
unidentified sources as saying the motions were made in the last two 
weeks 
the lawyers argue that fbi agents who posed as traders could only 
legally tape conversations in which they participated and 
conversations in which the agents participated have not been 
challenged the newspapers said 
federal law requires investigators to obtain court orders before 
taping conversations of people who have no reason to believe their 
discussion might be recorded otherwise taping such conversations 
amounts to eavesdropping and violates federal law defense 
attorneys have argued 
shouldts of the investigation because of illegal wiretaps 
could refuse to cooperate with investigators and use that fact in 
their defense in any subsequent court proceedings

theres an eightoutoften possibility of a 
work stoppage against eastern airlines as a march 3 strike deadline 
set by the militant machinists union approaches an official of the 
eastern pilots union says 
frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air crp is 
looking at the abyss the evil empire is tottering wright b 
george a member of the eastern master executive council of the air 
line pilots association said in an interview sunday 
sixteen months of talks on wages between miamibased eastern and 
the international association of machinists have resulted in no 
settlement and the union will be free to strike legally march 4 if 
a 30day coolingoff period mandated by the national mediation board 
expires without a new contract 
the coolingoff period expires at midnight est march 3 
intensified talks involving eastern management the machinists and 
federal mediators are due to start on wednesday in washington 
the two unions representing pilots and flight attendants at 
eastern have said they would honor any picket line set up by the 
machinists who represent about 8500 mechanics baggage handlers 
and other ground personnel 
we understand the risk of striking george said the 
worst thing that can happen to us is that we lose our jobs 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said the airline is 
guardedly optimistic that the dispute will be settled without a 
strike 
we dont want a strike a strike is not in the companys or the 
unions best interest he said matell reiterated easterns vow to 
continue operating in the event of a strike 
many financial analysts and other observers believe a bruising 
strike against eastern could jeopardize the airlines survival 
eastern recently reported a record net loss of 3354 million in 
1988 nearly double its 1817 million loss the year before revenue 
dropped to 38 billion from 44 billion in 1987 
the airlines latest contract offer to the machinists calls for 
150 million in wage cuts 
george conceded that lorenzo could well put eastern into chapter 
11 bankruptcy liquidate its assets or sell it outright 
he said pilots union officials have set up a meeting with wall 
street analysts and eastern creditors later this week in new york to 
discuss the risk to creditors if there is a strike the pilots held 
a similar session with analysts alone last september 
eastern currently has 550 million to 650 million in cash 
reserves roughly equivalent to its accounts payable george said 
matell put the reserve figure at around 400 million 
eastern has substantial cash reserves the spokesman said 
we keep our creditors well informed and they know that they have 
no cause for concern 
george insisted a strike will occur if rational heads dont 
prevail the 3400 eastern pilots he said have been seeking 
talks with management for months with job security their primary 
issue 
tom matthews easterns senior vice president for human resources 
and chief labor negotiator has told the pilots the company plans to 
contact their union on tuesday to discuss a schedule for 
negotiations 
however matell said talks with the pilots have been made more 
difficult by wednesdays scheduled start of supermediation with 
the machinists which will tie up easterns top negotiators he said 
the situation also has been complicated by the pilots union having 
recently changed the members of its negotiating committee
