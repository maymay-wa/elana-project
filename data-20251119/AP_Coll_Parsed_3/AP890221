iran recalled all its ambassadors from european common market 
nations tuesday and britain expelled an iranian envoy as the 
diplomatic battle grew over ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death 
threats against author salman rushdie 
in washington president bush said he supported the retaliatory 
moves by the european countries 
however offensive rushdies book the satanic verses may be 
to moslems inciting murder and offering rewards for its 
perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of civilized 
behavior bush said 
the united states does not have diplomatic relations with iran 
bush noted existing economic sanctions against iran and said i 
dont know where well go from there 
in ottawa foreign minister joe clark said tuesday that canada is 
withdrawing its charge daffaires from tehran for consultations on 
the death threats issue but is leaving one diplomatic 
representative in iran 
irans official islamic republic news agency said irans 
diplomatic recall was in response to mondays decision by the 12 
nations of the european economic community to withdraw their envoys 
from tehran for consultations 
iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani called the eec move 
a big mistake 
the eec decision is a clear sign which proves claims that 
the issue of this blasphemous book is a plot designed by western 
imperialism to fight true islam irna quoted him as saying 
we do not fear such threats we are prepared to follow our 
own path at a cost said rafsanjani 
the confrontation over rushdie appeared to be eroding efforts by 
some iranian officials including rafsanjani to strengthen ties 
with more nations despite opposition by fundamentalist hardliners 
although rafsanjani was not quoted as endorsing the death 
sentence his comments indicated iranian leaders were closing ranks 
in the face of retaliation for khomeinis death call 
president ali khamenei a rafsanjani ally said friday that 
rushdie might be pardoned if he repented and apologized rushdie a 
moslem himself apologized the next day but khomeini ignored the 
overture and renewed the death threat 
irans deputy foreign minister mohammad javad larijani said 
tuesday that although iran stood by its statements on rushdie it 
had not dispatched death squads to kill the author 
we have not closed the door on negotiations nor have we opened 
the door for confrontation larijani said in an interview with 
irna 
at the united nations secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
appealed to iran to spare the lives of rushdie and his publishers 
the 41yearold indianborn author has been in hiding with his 
wife in britain where he lives 
the common market nations stoppe short of breaking relations with 
iran but said that in addition to recalling top diplomats they 
would suspend highlevel visits to and from iran 
britain a market member went a step further by recalling its 
entire embassy staff on tuesday it announced it was expelling the 
iranian charge daffaires and his aide 
it is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal 
relationship with iran foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe told 
the house of commons 
sweden and norway followed the common market and recalled their 
ambassadors and sweden threatened to cancel a trade mission to 
tehran next month unless the death warrant were rescinded 
finland and austria summoned the iranian ambassadors to their 
nations to express disapproval of irans actions 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes their religion by 
portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as prostitutes and 
suggesting that he wrote the koran the holy book of islam rather 
than receiving it from god 
the novel was met with critical acclaim when viking published the 
547page book in britain in september 
it was not until last week on the eve of its publication in the 
united states that khomeini ordered moslems to track down rushdie 
and kill him 
publishers in france west germany greece and turkey then 
canceled plans to publish the book bookstores in japan and many in 
the united states pulled the novel from their shelves 
many independent booksellers continued to stock the novel 
however the new york times reported that based on last weeks sales 
the satanic verses will be listed as the second bestselling 
hardcover fiction book in the march 5 issue of the new york times 
book review 
a fullpage advertisement wednesday in the times announcing 
publication of the book proclaimed free people write books free 
people publish books free people sell books free people buy books 
free people read books the ad was signed by the association of 
american publishers the american booksellers association and the 
american library association 
in a letter tuesday to premier michel rocard of france the more 
than 500 authors in the french chapter of the international pen club 
called for publication of the satanic verses and said they were 
confident authorities could assure the publishers safety 
in west germany internationally acclaimed novelist guenter grass 
said a group of 24 writers will publish the book under an agreement 
with the publisher which said last week it feared for its employees 
in yugoslavia the belgrade daily borba stopped printing excerpts 
from the novel after anonymous callers threatened violent 
reprisals according to a newspaper employee who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
former israeli lawmaker shmuel flattosharon invited rushdie to 
stay in his 27room home in a tel aviv suburb and offered to buy 
the rights to the novel in the countries where publishers have 
balked 
we have a lot of problems here but security is not one of 
them flattosharon said 
in the british house of lords lord paget raised the possibility 
of a nuclear strike against iran if rushdie were murdered 
is there nothing we can do when the ayatollah is going around 
saying whos afraid of the big bad bomb he asked 
speaking for the government lord trefgarne replied we seek an 
improvement in our relations with iran and not a descent to the 
jungle

sultan ali kishtmand a ranking member 
of the ruling communist partys politburo and a hardliner tuesday 
took over many of the duties of prime minister government sources 
said 
moslem guerrillas meanwhile fired a salvo of rockets into the 
afghan capital killing one person and injuring three others on the 
ninth anniversary of an uprising against the sovietbacked 
government 
mohammad hasan sharq stepped down as prime minister monday and a 
21member supreme military council took power 
staterun kabul radio said kishtmand who served as prime 
minister for seven years until may 1988 is in charge of supervising 
the governments council of ministers 
government sources speaking on condition of anonyumity said 
this means the 52yearold kishtmand will effectively be the prime 
minister 
the return to power of of kishtmand the only prominent shiite 
moslem in president najibs government is seen as another move by 
najib to consolidate the power of his communist government 
shiites make up only 17 percent of afghanistans population but 
they account for about 40 percent of the refugees from which many of 
the guerrillas are drawn 
najib appointed sharq a noncommunist as prime minister last 
may in an unsucessful bid to seek a powersharing agreement with the 
moslem guerrillas 
in islamabad pakistan a committee of afghan field commanders 
and scholars sought to reach a consensus tuesday on the makeup of an 
interim government for afghanistan more than 400 delegates to a 
special afghan council or shura cancelled tuesdays session 
while the committee wrestled with a blueprint for a provisional 
government 
the commanders and scholars took over the job of nominating an 
interim government after guerrilla leaders paralyzed by differences 
between moderates and fundamentalists failed to break a deadlock 
monday 
the guerrillas rocket attack on kabul was the first since 
thursday when at least seven people were killed 
the foreign ministry said the fatal rocket in tuesdays assault 
hit near a government refugee office in northern kabul three other 
rockets hit southeastern kabul but there were no reports of 
casualties 
the guerrillas hold most of the countryside and are trying to 
close in on the cities which mainly are held by government troops 
at the headquarters of the secret police the foreign ministry 
displayed a huge cache of arms and explosives and said the 
guerrillas had planned to use them tuesday to attack buildings and 
bazaars 
many had markings from the united states britain egypt sweden 
china and italy officials said others were made in pakistan where 
the most powerful guerrilla groups are based 
moammad omar a state security agent said the weapons were 
seized monday in a well in eastern kabul 
business was brisk at some shops in kabul tuesday but others 
were closed to mark the anniversary of the antisoviet uprising 
the 1980 revolt occurred two months after soviet troops entered 
afghanistan to bolster a marxist government soviet soldiers fired 
on moslem protesters who emerged from their homes shouting god is 
great 
dozens of people were reported killed 
among the weapons displayed by the government were plastic 
explosives that agents said came from pakistan chinesemade hand 
grenades british mortar shells egyptian rockets italian fuses for 
mines swedish circuit testers and chinese rifles 
there also were political pamphlets one printed in english and 
the local language dari said we will contine our jihad holy 
war until the withdrawal of the last soviet soldier 
the final soviet troops once estimated at more than 100000 in 
afghanistan withdrew last wednesday under a unmediated accord 
over the weekend najib declared a state of emergency and shook 
up his government to consolidate control 
in geneva tuesday an investigator appointed by the united 
nations said both sides in the civil war continue to violate the 
human rights of afghans 
austrian law professor felix ermacora said reliable reports 
suggest dfghan police still widely use torture and mistreatment as 
part of interrogations 
his report also listed alleged incidents cited by a variety of 
corroborating sources in which rebels had killed more than 100 
afghan soldiers and civilians since september

the old dream of wiping out grain surpluses by 
turning corn into fuelgrade alcohol is a long way from coming true 
but progress continues according to industry and farm officials 
the national corn growers association for example says ethanol 
blends will be introduced this fall in the phoenix ariz area to 
comply with the states new clean air law 
blended fuels basically 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent 
gasoline are said to cut automobile carbon monoxide emissions by as 
much as 25 percent another alternative is petroleumbased mtbe or 
methyltertiarybutylether which can reduce emissions by 10 
percent 
the corn producers said denver initiated the nations first fuels 
program using ethanol and mtbe blends a year ago and that the 
success of the denver program was instrumental in passage of 
arizonas clean air law 
an estimated 340 million bushels of corn were used to produce 800 
million gallons of ethanol for fuel blending last year with blends 
representing 8 percent of all gasoline sales in 1988 the 
association said 
the renewable fuels association a washingtonbased trade 
association representing the ethanol industry said more than 84 
billion gallons of ethanolgasoline blends were sold in 42 states 
last year the association said more than 60 ethanol plants are 
operating in 23 states representing a private investment of more 
than 25 billion 
ethanol use in gasoline to make gasohol was spurred by the 
second oil embargo by opec countries in the late 1970s the 
association said and by a rush of subsidies from the federal and 
state governments 
the fervor at the time also prompted hopes that burdensome grain 
surpluses could be used as feed stock thus bolstering the nations 
farm economy as well as contributing to the fuel supply 
what is even more significant is that this superior record of 
growth has been sustained through good economic conditions and 
bad the association said this past year unusually high grain 
prices caused by the drought and nearrecord low oil prices 
threatened to severely weaken this industry 
but while three plants were forced to shut down temporarily 
little production capacity was lost and sales have remained quite 
strong 
the agriculture department has not viewed ethanol possibilities 
with the enthusiasm of the corn and industry associations there are 
economic problems that wont go away simply because ethanol sounds 
like a good idea says the departments economic research service 
ethanol gained support as it also promised environmental 
benefits and new markets and uses for corn and other surplus 
crops the agency said in a recent background paper but the 
sense of urgency over the need to develop alternative fuels 
dissipated as petroleum prices declined 
but public attention once again is being drawn to alcohol fuels 
to help reduce pollution ease dependence on foreign oil and to 
provide a greater market for farm crops 
compliance deadlines of the clean air act passed and the 
standards are still unmet the report said us petroleum 
imports have increased to the high levels of the early 1970s 
as to the future usda analysts said ethanols success will 
depend on energy environmental agricultural and trade policies 
those are factors that will determine the prices costs and 
competitiveness of the ethanol industry 
the us fuel ethanol industry was created by a mix of federal 
and state subsidies loan programs and other incentives the 
report said 
a handful of large plants produce most of the us ethanol the 
report said the eight largest owned by five companies accounted 
for nearly 75 percent of the operating capacity in 1986 
ethanol is exempt from 6 cents of the 9cent federal excise 
tax through september 1993 the report said at the 10 percent 
blending rate that exemption is effectively a 60centpergallon 
subsidy many states provide similar financial incentives averaging 
20 to 30 cents per gallon 
the federal government also helps with loan guarantees to 
encourage plant construction but most of these plants have not 
been successful the report said only one of the three plants 
with loans guaranteed by the energy department was operating and 
paying off its loans by early 1988 
at usdas farmers home administration spokesman marlyn aycock 
said loan guarantees for 11 plants were initially obligated but that 
only three are currently in operation 
aycock said fmha has made no ethanol loans since 1984 and that 
the maximum had been reduced by half from 20 billion per plant to 
10 million 
the usda background report said the production of ethanol so far 
has not significantly affected income for farmers participating in 
government commodity programs 
moderate levels of ethanol production would only slightly 
affect total farm revenue and income the report said it is 
unlikely that modest increases in ethanol production would drive 
market prices for corn to exceed current target price levels in the 
federal commodity programs within the next 8 to 10 years

antiamerican protesters are 
challenging south koreas policies toward the united states and 
sparking more us criticism here than at any time in four decades 
from student radicals yelling yankee go home to farmers 
denouncing us agriculture imports south koreans are venting their 
frustration and anger at one of their oldest allies 
when president bush visits seoul next monday he will find what 
one newspaper warns is a society quite different from the one he 
saw as vice president in april 1982 
dont come to korea bush yell radical students punctuating 
the words with raised clenched fists 
criticism of the united states is no longer relegated to private 
conversation american flags are torched and effigies of uncle sam 
or bush are burned 
some 12000 angry farmers battled thousands of riot police with 
clubs and firebombs outside the national assembly this month and 
denounced the united states for trying to force open south koreas 
agricultural market 
radical students staged a series of attacks on us facilities to 
demand an end to american influence they vowed to hold nationwide 
antigovernment antius demonstrations to coincide with the 
presidents visit 
arson violence destruction and lawlessness cannot be 
tolerated said president roh taewoo in demanding an end to 
protests 
every us president since the korean war except richard nixon 
has visited seoul but none has come during a time of more public 
animosity against washington policies 
businessmen laborers and students who have never thrown a 
firebomb are heard to complain that south korea is victimized by 
unfair trade pressures and rude yankee arrogance 
when asked their nationality by a korean us citizens rarely 
acknowledge that they are american the us embassy and the us 
military have cautioned citizens against wearing clothing which 
labels them from the usa 
the united states is no longer a sacred cow said a western 
diplomat requesting anonymity america is no longer the patron 
saint of south korea 
the united states has played roles in past dictatorial 
governments and we oppose the visit of us president bush claims 
a labor alliance demanding investigations into corruption and human 
rights abuses of the past ussupported authoritarian government 
a few weeks ago the united states said it was considering 
closing its cultural center in the provincial capital of kwangju 
180 miles south of seoul because of repeated violent attacks and 
concern for the safety of its staff 
kwangju was the scene of a bloody nineday civil uprising in 
1980 many opposition and dissident figures claim the united states 
shared responsibility for the kwangju incident by acquiescing in a 
militarybacked south korean government plan to quell the uprising 
the united states denied the charge 
although public protests appear outwardly to have scant impact on 
relations and radicals have little public support government 
leaders warn that growing antiamerican sentiment could endanger 
south koreas interests in washington 
the government lost no time in apologizing publicly for the 
kwangju center attacks and appealed to radical students not to 
damage traditional koreaus friendship 
the assistant foreign minister kim sukkyu reflects the 
thinking of many when he says antiamericanism is a minority view 
and a passing phenomenon despite loud voices and antiamerican 
activists 
more than half of south koreas 40 million people have been born 
since the korean war ended 35 years ago and long time observers 
link the intensity of antiamerican feeling to the age of the 
participant the younger the person the more likely he or she is to 
feel the united states has taken its relationship with south korea 
for granted 
the korean peninsula has been divided into the capitalist south 
and the communist north since the end of world war ii in 1945 the 
united states helped south korea fight the 195053 korean war 
against the north and keeps 42000 troops stationed in the south 
under a mutual defense pact 
radical students and dissidents feel the presence of us troops 
stand in the way of unification talks with the north and have 
demanded the withdrawal of all us forces they also demand the 
halt to this years joint ussouth korea military exercises called 
team spirit 
a more realistic relationship is needed between the two 
governments say both protesters and some politicians a 
relationship which recognizes south koreas economic potential and 
place in global politics 
the united states is seouls leading trade partner korea sold 
america goods worth 8 billion more than it bought from the united 
states last year considerable pressure has been placed on the 
koreans to liberalize their import regulations to help balance the 
deficit 
antiamerican comment became acceptable socially after last 
falls olympic games when south koreans of all ages had their 
frustration and resentment against the united states stoked by what 
they regarded as unruly behavior of us athletes and biased 
coverage by nbc

when the oil and the good times were flowing 
louisianas populist system of government seemed to make sense give 
the people a free ride and let the businesses pay now oil has 
crashed louisiana has suffered through four years of economic 
depression and economists say recovery isnt possible without a new 
system a reformist governor is trying to do just that but breaking 
with the populist past doesnt come easy this second of two parts 
of bad times on the bayou explores this louisiana revolution 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the 34story louisiana state capitol 
casts a long shadow over the white marble statue of huey long but 
these days it seems the statue is casting the longer shadow 
an unconquered friend of the poor the inscription on longs 
adjacent tomb says who dreamed of the day when the wealth of the 
land would be spread among the people 
the populist ideas of the kingfish who governed from 
19281932 still influence the fiscal structure of the state 
spread the wealth protect the poor 
homeowners receive a 75000 property tax exemption making the 
average home tax free automobile license plates cost only 3 a 
year city councils cant raise taxes without a vote of the people 
businesses bear much of the burden through taxes and fees 
but the way of doing business that huey long helped build is 
crippling the state now economists say without the oil windfall 
state and local budgets cant be balanced schools and hospitals are 
suffering unemployment has soared and new businesses are scared 
away by the tax structure 
its ironic what is supposed to be good for the people now 
acts to their detriment said university of new orleans economist 
tim ryan 
added business leader eugene schreiber director of new orleans 
world trade center weve got to change we cannot do business in 
the old ways painful as it is its forced us to wake up 
but waking up isnt easy in the land of the big easy as new 
orleans is called 
after a string of legislative victories and a fierce round of 
budget cutting and borrowing gov buddy roemers initial attempt at 
overhauling the tax structure failed in the state house 
the harvardeducated conservative democrat has in his own words 
poked every bear in the forest while inciting a revolution in 
louisiana 
he won education reform campaign finance reform tort reform 
workers compensation reform even unemployment insurance reform 
but when it came to fiscal reform when it came to dismantling the 
last vestiges of the populist past roemer lost 
cant a familys home be the one thing thats not taxed roemers 
opponents asked 
i believe in paying our own way that is a break from louisiana 
tradition roemer said it doesnt come easy 
along the way roemer is also compiling a spectrum of political 
enemies ranging from populists to labor unions to teachers public 
opinion polls are divided on the maverick reformer 
the question remains what happens if he cant complete the 
revolution 
it would be more of the same wed be a slave to saudi arabia 
a wasteland a welfare state roemer said adding that people 
with the means to move away would do so 
politicians he said are beginning to realize that 
fiscal reform has become the vortex of louisianas struggle to 
climb out of a depression that began when the price of oil fell by 
more than half in 198485 tens of thousands lost jobs and both 
businesses and workers left the state 
and taxes on oil which used to account for 40 percent of the 
louisiana state budget plummeted the state long known for its 
big spending ways hadnt put anything aside for dry years it 
hadnt spent much on developing a strong economic base outside of 
oil in fact it hadnt even had a balanced budget in the 1980s 
until roemer took office 10 months ago even though it has a 
balanced budget law 
its debt reached 2 billion 
we could not make the payroll the week after i took office 
roemer said 
now state promoters planners and business leaders all buzz with 
talk about louisianas recovery if there is fiscal reform 
when the price of oil was 40 a barrel hardly anybody 
worried said schreiber the businessman who chaired a governors 
task force on labor 
having all these advantages made everyone in the state very 
lazy louisiana has not been competitive in business schreiber 
said its only really now that the state is pulling its act 
together 
the day after reform failed last october two companies 
considering louisiana announced plans to build in texas other 
businesses considering a relocation or expansion in the bayou state 
are holding off until they see if reform passes said louisianas 
chief of economic development connie lewis 
wall street bond brokers set out informal guidelines for what 
would be necessary to raise the states bond rating currently just 
one notch above junk bonds low bond ratings means the state must 
pay higher interest on its debt roemer has accomplished all but one 
item fiscal reform said his chief of staff steve cochran 
they watch us very closely he said 
the battle will probably be waged this spring when roemer comes 
back to the legislature with a plan last time his package passed 
the state senate but came up 10 votes short of the necessary 
twothirds margin in the house 
the opposition focused on roemers plan to cut by twothirds the 
75000 homestead exemption the nations highest it was led by a 
county tax assessor lawrence chehardy who saw reform as an attempt 
to raise taxes and cripple the average homeowner 
people in louisiana read horror stories in other states where 
property taxes did go wild said chehardy government taxes 
everything cant there be one thing in life a person can have 
without being taxed 
chehardy says lawmakers should cut the budget and if there are 
any tax increases taxpayers should get a chance to vote 
but roemer and his top aides insist the budget has been cut so 
much more than 500 million that further reductions could 
cripple the state already they worry about the declining quality 
of care at statefinanced charity hospitals and the ability of 
cities like new orleans to get by without the traditional state 
support 
and the next fiscal year budget has a projected deficit of 734 
million the total budget is 42 billion but only 22 billion is 
discretionary spending money that isnt tied to court orders or 
debt payments 
cutting that much 734 million would shut more and more 
hospitals cut transportation money and higher education said 
commissioner of administration dennis stine that is in my mind 
shutting down government 
still the early talk of next junes budget is a revolutionary 
concept by itself in louisiana a state that at times balanced its 
budget for only threequarters of the year and hoped oil prices 
would go up

john keker the lawyer prosecuting oliver north 
in the irancontra trial has a reputation for intuitively making 
the right move in a courtroom 
in a civil lawsuit lawyers for a bank abruptly asked one of 
kekers clients whether he would waive the attorneyclient privilege 
of confidentiality 
reacting to the unorthodox request keker quickly said his client 
an investor who alleged he had been defrauded would agree to a 
waiver if the bank was willing to waive the same privilege covering 
conversations with its attorneys 
the bank backed down 
representing an insurance company accused of overcharging its 
customers keker on crossexamination asked an expert witness to 
select from a stock of well over 100 files the one he considered to 
be the most egregious example of overcharging 
robert a van nest a partner in kekers san francisco law firm 
recalls that keker spent a minute familiarizing himself with the 
contents of the file selected by the expert and then proceeded to 
tear the witness apart 
two things about john said van nest his tenacity and his 
intuition 
he doesnt let a point drop he will fight all the way to 
whatever is there 
hes remarkably intuitively skilled in a courtroom its a 
great athletes intuition to know where the ball is and where 
everything is on the field john has that kind of intuition he has 
an ability to respond to the evidence 
kekers ability to kind of sense where the witness is going 
is a rare skill in todays lawyer said van nest so many of 
us take deposition after deposition and theres nothing to predict 
kekers weaker points he has as many weaknesses as the san 
francisco 49ers said van nest 
the north case will be kekers first as a prosecutor but his 
abilities as a defense lawyer translate easily to the other side of 
the courtroom says william t mcgivern jr chief assistant us 
attorney for the northern district of california 
hes always been aggressive and he can bring that aggression to 
the prosecution side said mcgivern hes aware of the moves of 
a defense lawyer having been one himself 
in short keker can try a case theres no doubt about that 
said mcgivern who as a prosecutor has been involved in several 
cases in which keker has been a defense attorney 
a vietnam war veteran who served in the marines and was wounded 
in combat keker is a graduate of princeton university and yale law 
school and a founding partner of keker amp brockett in san francisco 
he has successfully defended movie maker george lucas in a civil 
lawsuit and won a case in which his client a san francisco society 
figure and architect was accused of vehicular manslaughter 
after the irancontra affair erupted in 1986 keker sought work 
with independent counsel lawrence walsh 
john felt there was an important lesson here for americans who 
care about the democratic process and he was intent in participating 
in the investigation for that reason said van nest 
van nest said keker had concerns that those involved appeared to 
have been hiding the ball running foreign policy without the 
consent of representatives of the people 
the political and legal implications struck me as enormous 
keker said of the irancontra episode in an interview last year with 
the los angeles times 
keker 45 has more than 15 years as a trial lawyer and relishes 
the role 
when you go to court he told the times you get a chance 
to be a hero which is a thing that most people repress the desire 
for you also get a chance to fail enormously 
that sort of edge is something that people who are trial 
lawyers usually like you get a chance to do the right thing you 
get a chance to do it in a stylish way

the federal foreign aid agency says the time 
has come for a radical reshaping of the way the united states 
allocates the billions of dollars a year it passes out to other 
nations 
the recommendation was contained in a 158page report issued 
monday by the administrator of the agency for international 
development alan woods 
the challenges of todays problems and tomorrows cannot be 
met with yesterdays solutions suitable as they may have been to 
yesterdays problems the report said 
the study which made no specific recommendations for policy 
changes said the aid program no longer seems able to fulfill its 
original mandate of helping poor countries achieve the transition 
from dependency to selfsufficiency 
somewhere between 1949 and the present the original concept of 
aid as a transitional means of helping countries become 
selfsufficient has been lost it said 
is todays us foreign aid fostering healthy development 
towards independent prosperity or simply postponing the day of 
reckoning for governments unwilling or unable to take the 
politically painful steps needed for their own development the 
report asked 
all too often dependency seems to have won out over 
development the report said 
a principal conclusion calls for radically reshaping future 
official assistance programs to face new realities and to coordinate 
government assistance with us private sector involvement in 
providing humanitarian aid education and overseas investment 
this reshaping must be both an immediate concern and a major 
longterm national priority nothing less will serve the national 
interests of the united states the report said 
woods noted in comments to a group of reporters that no country 
has graduated from less developed to developed status in the 
past 20 years 
all this is in sharp contrast to the marshall plan of the late 
1940s and early 1950s when an ambitious us aid program helped 
put western europe on its feet and then was terminated 
one problem highlighted by the report is that succeeding 
congresses and administrations prodded by the dominant crises and 
interest groups of the moment have piled differing and often 
conflicting foreign assistance objectives on top of each other 
this dizzying array ranges from winning friends for the 
united states to alleviating poverty to countering the soviet 
union and to finding markets for american farm products the report 
said 
in a december speech rep lee hamilton dind a member of a 
bipartisan house task force on foreign aid said the 33 separate 
statutory objectives for foreign assistance are so numerous that 
they do not provide meaningful direction 
all of these 33 objectives may be worthy i probably voted for 
most of them however a program that pursues all objectives 
risks accomplishing none of them he said 
complicating fulfillment of these objectives has been a decline 
in the amount of aid appropriated from 19 billion in 1985 to 14 
billion this year hamilton said 
the woods report suggested that developmental success has less to 
do with foreign aid levels than with the internal policies of 
recipient countries 
where development has worked and is working the key has been 
economic growth it said and this is largely the result of the 
individual nations making the right policy choices and making the 
most of their internal human and material resources 
the report said growthoriented policies are a constant among 
success cases regardless of the level of aid they have received 
which are sometimes greater and sometimes less than the levels 
received by developmental laggards 
it said the impressive development of first japan and later 
taiwan and south korea in east asia is proof positive that the right 
donor program and guidance when matched by the right recipient 
policies can result in a smooth transition from dependence to 
selfsufficiency

since taking office in may gov buddy roemer has balanced a 
state budget for the first time in the 1980s hes steered a package 
of reforms through the legislature including political campaign 
reform and education reform yet he lost his most important battle 
overhauling the states populist taxing structure 
here in excerpts from an interview with associated press 
regional reporter scott mccartney roemer discusses his goals and 
concerns for louisiana from his baton rouge la office 
</TEXT>

question what are you trying to do to this state it seems like 
theres a revolution going on 
answer it really is we inherited the highest unemployment 
rate in america and a budget that was in shambles for a variety of 
reasons for example the price of oil in last years budget was 21 
a barrel oil never saw 21 it was a phony figure which exasperated 
the deficit weve got it oil which is currently around 17 a 
barrel at 1380 thats how tough we are 
as a result i think the business community in the state and 
outside of the state knows that somethings happening in louisiana 
our unemployment rate is beginning to go down it was above 12 
percent when i took office its now about 95 
q is it the attitudes in the state that youre bumping up 
against 
a we had a state and i love louisiana but we had a state where 
big money beat big ideas and thats a loser were trying to 
reverse it its not done weve got a ways to go we need to 
rewrite our tax code to give businesses incentives to grow jobs i 
tried i failed by a close margin well try it again and win it 
when we do that all of the ingredients will be in place 
watch us i want to warn texas and the other states of the 
southwest watch us 
q is it fair to say what youre really doing is throwing out the 
past throwing out the populist government throwing out the legacy 
of huey long 
a right in part i want to be fair to huey because he had many 
great points huey built the roads in this state to tie farms to 
market he gave children free textbooks so when we say were 
breaking with the past i really dont think of huey long i do 
think of the populist strain where theres something for nothing and 
everybody else pays the bill we are trying to break from that 
i believe in paying our own way that is a break from louisiana 
tradition it doesnt come easy 
q what would happen if tax reform doesnt pass 
a it would be more of the same wed be a slave to saudi arabia 
wed be a slave to how many times opec can get together and jack the 
price around wed be a wasteland a welfare state those who are 
without hope those who are without means wont move they cant 
theyre stuck those with an education with financial mobility are 
going to vote with their feet theyre going to leave and for the 
first time the politicians are beginning to realize that 
every bear in the forest ive poked now is the time to do it 
there are some who think that if i do my job right i could never 
get elected to another public office 
q do you believe it 
a might be true 
q do you care 
a i dont i would be totally satisfied four years from now 
to prop my feet up on the desk and say well done 
q do you think things can turn around that quickly 
a yes in terms of public perception and attitude thats the 
real fight the fight is not the unemployment rate that goes up and 
down with national trends and a lot of things out of our control 
youll see an improvement over four years and fairly dramatic but 
what needs to turn around is attitude 
i found many people in this state who had given up who felt 
louisiana could not change who felt that we were a slave to our 
past who felt that the populist politicians owned louisiana 
theyre beginning to realize now that we are winners not me we 
this states a winner

not so long ago american policymakers would 
be concerned about the forthcoming sinosoviet summit the first one 
in 30 years but thats no longer the case and the meeting is not 
likely to blemish president bushs trip to beijing this weekend 
if sinosoviet rapprochement contributes to the stability of 
the region and the globe then it is all to the good said one old 
asia hand who is helping plan bushs trip 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs scheduled visit to 
beijing in may will end the sinosoviet rift and highlight kremlin 
concessions on the three points the chinese have said were 
preventing improved relations for a decade 
gorbachevs meeting with senior chinese leader deng xiaopeng 
will be the first sinosoviet summit since nikita s khrushchev met 
with mao tsetung in 1959 mao and khrushchev later argued over 
ideology and soviet and chinese troops clashed in the 1960s and 
1970s along the 4670mile border 
the reason the chinese are welcoming the soviet leader and that 
the united states does not object is the marked shift in kremlin 
foreign policy in the four years gorbachev has been in power 
according to scholars and government experts 
before agreeing to meet with the russians the chinese wanted the 
soviets out of afghanistan the vietnamese out of cambodia and a 
reduction of soviet troops along the border 
the kremlin has met or started to meet all of those conditions 
the last red army soldier left afghanistan last week ending a 
bloody and futile nineyear occupation 
vietnam a close military ally of the soviet union has removed 
some of the more than 100000 troops it sent into cambodia in 1978 
and agreed to negotiations over withdrawing the rest 
in 1987 the soviet union withdrew 12000 of its troops from 
mongolia on the chinese border and last december gorbachev 
announced unspecified further reductions in the estimated 50000 
troops remaining there 
the sinosoviet summit in short derives from gorbachevs 
efforts to change soviet policies and to make friends rather than 
enemies around the world 
there could be a summit only if the soviet union changed its 
pattern of behavior from the last two or three decades said 
stephen morris a fellow at the russian research center at harvard 
university 
the things that brought the soviets and the chinese together 
are the same things that brought the soviets and the americans 
together said morris a specialist on soviet relations with asian 
nations 
a state department specialist on asia who spoke on condition he 
not be further identified noted that both the chinese and the 
soviets have stressed that the normalization of their relations will 
not affect their ties with any other country in other words the 
united states 
if the soviets fully meet the conditions laid down by the 
chinese said the government expert that will be a big plus for 
stability in the region 
bush announcing his trip to china indicated that the time had 
passed for the kind of geopolitical maneuver that opened the door of 
uschinese relations in the 1970s the china card played by 
thenpresident nixon against the kremlin 
well i dont know what signal it sends in that regard but let 
me just remind you that im the one who does not believe in playing 
the soviet card or playing the china card bush said on jan 
28 
the most recent senior us official to visit china thendefense 
secretary frank c carlucci said in beijing last september that 
we think the relaxation of tensions between china and the soviet 
union would be healthy for world peace and stability 
a report from the conservative heritage foundation in washington 
concluded that a beijingmoscow summit need not bode ill for the 
united states 
the united states does not necessarily gain if chinesesoviet 
relations remain cool nor does the united states necessarily lose 
of those relations improve wrote heritage analyst andrew b brick 
relations between the communist giants has already improved in 
recent years noted brick and the two are natural trading partners 
with similar economies a long border and natural resources that 
the other needs 
under a bilateral trade pact signed in 1985 said brick the 
soviet union has become chinas fifth largest trading partner with 
barter exchange rising from 260 billion in 1981 to 18 billion 
last year and expected to reach 6 billion by 1990

more and more swedes are calling in sick 
from their jobs and authorities say they plan to try to find out if 
they are faking abuses in one of the worlds most liberal welfare 
systems may be costing billions in sick pay 
a recent study by the swedish employers association said the 
average swedish worker in industry missed 27 days a year for illness 
in 1987 compared with 18 days in west germany 16 in france and 11 
in britain 
a recent opinion poll indicated that 86 percent of those 
questioned suspected their colleagues of cheating official 
statistics show that sick pay costs have increased by 50 percent 
over the past three years 
swedens sick pay plan has traditionally been based on the honor 
system under a 1987 reform bluecollar workers joined other wage 
earners in being entitled to 90 percent of their pay when they are 
off sick starting from the first day they stay home 
the government handles the payments but most of the money comes 
from taxes paid by employers 
in the swedish system an employee who is ill calls his social 
insurance office and later signs a form stating the nature of the 
illness a doctors certificate is required only if the worker is 
home for a week or more 
one form of abuse is simply for an employee to call in sick when 
hes not however authorities say its even more common for workers 
to file for sick pay and go to work anyway getting sick pay in 
addition to regular pay its difficult to check 
if i knock on the door and nobody opens what is my proof 
yvonne stroberg a local official said recently on swedish 
television she suggested more telephone checks with employers 
rather than home visits by inspectors 
the national accounting board described another scheme in a 
report late last year it said some people collect payments for sick 
leave parental leave and student grants for the same period 
karl gustaf scherer director of the national social insurance 
board said on television his organization would increase its 
supervision 
in bandhagen south of stockholm the local office started a 
threeweek campaign to check all claims on certain days 
sick leave pensions and various other social benefits are 
expected to cost 20 percent of the gross national product this year 
illness benefits last year amounted to 5 billion 120 million 
more than sweden paid for defense 
one option under study is to let employers take over sick 
payments for those absent from work up to two weeks saving the 
government money and paperwork the employer would then claim a 
refund from the authorities 
unions have opposed the plan margareta svensson at the 
bluecollar general confederation of unions said it would permit 
employers to put pressure on employees 
there would be people who would not dare to be off ill if 
their employer controlled sick payments she said 
since benefits are administered locally there is no official 
overall picture of cheating nationwide 
a random check by insurance offices in the west coast town of 
halmstad indicated 20 percent of all sick claims were false and the 
figure was 15 percent in neighboring varberg svenska dagbladet said 
another study reported by the dagens nyheter newspaper said a 
threeday check of claimants in the northern province of jamtland 
showed all 180 cases were valid 
the national accounting boards report said illness claims valid 
or not varied strongly by location the 10 districts with the 
highest absenteeism were lowincome suburbs of swedens three 
largest cities 
the head of the social insurance office in rinkeby a stockholm 
suburb inhabited mostly by immigrants topped the list with an 
absentee rate almost twice as high as the national average 
people out here have heavy monotonous dangerous and boring 
jobs said gun britt johansson head of rinkebys social insurance 
office

president bush will use his upcoming trip to 
south korea to reaffirm the us commitment to that countrys 
security while seeking improved access for american products in 
south korean markets us officials say 
on the final leg of a trip that also will take him to japan and 
china bush plans to spend 4 hours in seoul the south korean 
capital there he will meet with president roh taewoo and other 
officials and visit some of the more than 40000 us troops 
stationed in the country 
bush departs wednesday for tokyo where he will attend fridays 
funeral of japanese emperor hirohito he will spend two nights in 
beijing before flying to seoul on monday 
although us officials are delighted with the political and 
economic development of south korea in recent years there is 
growing impatience over south korean barriers to us exports 
including beef and fruit 
the result is a lopsided trade imbalance in south koreas favor 
about 10 billion last year on total twoway trade of slightly more 
than 30 billion 
korea has free access to us markets korea should now open 
up said one state department official who spoke on condition 
that he not be identified further 
another irritant in the relationship between the two countries is 
the large us military presence in the capital area us and south 
korean officials have been engaged in discussions designed to ease 
the frictions 
there is a small but determined radical movement in south korea 
which is driven primarily by antiamericanism 
the radicals have attacked the us cultural center in kwangju 
several times over the past month a principal rallying cry recently 
has been opposition to the bush visit 
south korea is a far different country today from the one which 
bush saw in 1982 his last visit there 
the countrys unpopular military dictatorship has been replaced 
by a democratically elected government and south korea now ranks 
among the world leaders in economic growth rates 
the united states has made a major contribution to south koreas 
prosperity accounting for 34 percent of the countrys exports 
it is quite a change from the situation in the country during the 
decade after the armistice ended the korean war in 1953 when the 
destitution there was such that some us officials recommended 
suspending all economic assistance considering the countrys future 
prospects to be beyond hope 
south korea has been playing an increasingly active role 
internationally establishing trade and diplomatic ties in eastern 
europe and hosting the olympic games last september 
last fall roh began making peace overtures to north korea and 
asked thenpresident reagan to complement south koreas steps with 
gestures of his own 
reagan responded by liberalizing rules for us diplomatic 
contact with north koreans encouraging cultural exchanges between 
the two countries and easing restrictions on tourist travel and the 
export of humanitarian items to north korea 
a subsequent exchange of notes included a north korean proposal 
for formal diplomatic discussions which the united states regarded 
as unacceptable because it undercut south koreas position 
still us officials have been encouraged by an apparent easing 
of tensions recently on the peninsula an area long viewed as having 
the potential for an outbreak of eastwest hostilities because of 
the major stake that both superpowers have there

the polisario guerrilla front says it 
will hold a second round of talks next week with moroccos king 
hassan ii to discuss extending a truce and a political solution for 
the disputed western sahara 
polisario leader mohammed abdelaziz speaking to a news 
conference monday also dismissed the newly declared fivenation 
union of north african arab states as unviable as long as the 
conflict over western sahara is unresolved 
it is like building houses on a volcano which can erupt at any 
time abdelaziz said speaking through a translator 
the leaders of morocco algeria mauritania libya and tunisia 
declared the union on friday but did not disclose details on how it 
will function 
one likely result would be a suspension of aid and support by 
algeria for the polisarios 13year war to free western sahara from 
moroccan rule 
morocco annexed most of the former spanish territory in 1976 
abdelaziz said he received word sunday that king hassan had 
agreed to meet a polisario delegation next week but the date and 
venue was not set 
the king first met the polisarios for two days in early january 
the guerrillas later declared a ceasefire for february to improve 
the climate for the fivenation summit in marrakech abdelaziz said 
asked if the truce could be extended he said he hoped the 
meeting with hassan will be an occasion to transfer the truce into 
a political agreement 
he said the polisarios would not relinquish the demand for 
sovereignty over all of western sahara and rejected the idea of 
autonomy under a moroccan flag 
the options which should be put to the inhabitants in a 
referendum are total independence or integration into morocco for 
us the only choice is total independence he said 
the polisario delegation was in sweden as guest of the governing 
social democratic party it was to meet prime minister ingvar 
carlsson opposition leaders and swedish red cross officials

donald trump can buy hotels he can buy football 
teams he can buy casinos and airlines but he cant buy respect 
spy magazine calls him a shortfingered vulgarian cartoonist 
berke breathed takes trumps brain and installs it in the skull of 
bill the cat the foul feline of bloom county a daily news 
columnist writes that when she needs cheering up she watches 
donald trump do something silly 
the stand up new york comedy club devoted a night to ridiculing 
trump for two hours comics drew laughter with readings from 
trump the art of the deal and took their own potshots 
suggesting for example that he bought a parisian landmark and 
renamed it the arc de trump 
the 43yearold billionaire does not believe he deserves this 
tidal wave of derision which rises along with his success and 
prominence but trump who declined to be interviewed thinks he 
understands it 
those who dont like me dont know me and have never met me 
he told time magazine my guess is that they dislike me out of 
jealousy 
not so say trumps detractors they dislike him on merits 
hes just an everyday slob with too much money he just doesnt 
have enough taste to keep his name off of things said breathed 
the sequence about trumps transplanted cerebrum breathed said 
is born of his conviction that trump looks too smooth and polished 
on the outside he should look like bill the cat 
trump is no stranger to the funny pages he also appeared within 
the past year in doonesbury garry trudeau showed trump tossing 
casino chips from the deck of his 282foot yacht the trump 
princess to small boats below this obviously was not the 
quality image trump wants to project 
i did pretty well in school but for the life of me i really 
cant understand what doonesbury is about trump has said he 
suggested trudeaus wife televisions jane pauley has a lot more 
talent than he does 
critics have found fault with trumps taste when he announced 
last month that he intended to close that plaza hotel landmark of 
bogus hawaiiana trader vics a closing that he delayed when the 
threat of the bars demise improved business trump said he was 
doing so not because of any hostility to samoan fog cutters and 
similar drinks but because the bar was tacky 
wildly tacky riposted village voice reporter guy trebay

does donald trump think a waterfall wall is the acme of subtle 
design 
critics have found fault with trumps ego and penchant for 
selfpromotion daily news columnist gail collins writing about a 
new board game based on trumps wheeling and dealing noted that 
trump the game contained approximately nine million photos 
of donald trump 
the game is meant for players 12 and up and i suppose there 
could be worse things to give your 12yearold than a game that 
encourages him to act like donald trump uzi the crack dealer 
for example she mused 
critics have found fault with trumps dedication to building 
glitzy buildings in a city where homelessness and poverty are 
endemic one group staged a brunch for the homeless this month in 
front of the plaza along with a public shaming of its owner 
trump did not attend

out of business within a year now each issue contains a countdown 
of our death foretold last week an outraged trump claimed that 
the father of a spy executive had suggested spy would ease up on 
trump if the trump shuttle offered the magazine to passengers spy 
said this was a joke 
the irreverent and irascible magazine is fixated on the big t 
on the eerily stiff hairdo of trumps wife ivana on trump

kenyan diplomats are lobbying congress to block 
a threat by several congressmen to limit aid to kenya because of 
alleged human rights abuses 
the effort follows some acerbic criticism by the head of the 
house panel that appropriates money for foreign aid it will be a 
cold day in youknowwhere before this committee earmarks money for 
kenya said rep david r obey dwis at a recent hearing on 
human rights in africa 
earmarking is a method congress uses to guarantee that select 
countries receive a certain amount of foreign aid making them 
immune from administration attempts to shift assistance to other 
priorities the bulk of us foreign aid is earmarked for about 20 
countries leaving the administration little room for maneuvering 
with the aid 
economic aid for kenya has been earmarked for the past three 
years skillful efforts by kenya and its lobbyists last year brought 
the military component of the assistance under the protection of the 
earmark too despite obeys objections 
kenya got 15 million in military aid which accounts for about 
60 percent of all us military assistance to subsaharan africa 
and an additional 45 million in economic and development funds 
kenya supporters in the administration and on capitol hill cite 
the access granted by the strategically placed country to us navy 
ships at mombasa and to air force planes at its airfields as reason 
enough for the financial support 
but since last fall when the aid was appropriated for fiscal 
year 1989 several other congressmen have joined obey head of the 
house appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations in 
criticizing what they view as kenyas deteriorating human rights 
situation 
william gray a member of obeys committee who also serves as 
chairman of the democratic caucus in the house issued a statement 
at the same hearing critical of kenya 
gray said kenya which had been a shining star in africa and a 
model for its neighbors over many years had been turning in a 
different direction in recent years resulting in an erosion of its 
human rights record 
specific charges against kenya by human rights groups as well as 
the state departments annual international human rights report 
include the stifling of political opposition by banning political 
parties and jailing dissidents 
critics also object to recent constitutional amendments that 
allow president daniel arap moi to dismiss judges and to detain 
criminal suspects without trial for up to 14 days 
but kenyan ambassador denis afande said critics fail to 
understand that kenya is acting strictly within the bounds of its 
own constitution and laws kenya is trying very hard to respect 
the rule of law he said in an interview the criticism here is 
very demoralizing to my people 
other african nations have much worse records than kenya he 
said and many kenyans feel their country is being picked on 
unfairly we were very surprised by all this afande said

as many as 7000 people were evacuated 
from their homes monday after a leaking crude oil tank at a chevron 
plant created a noxious cloud of gas with traces of hydrogen 
sulfide officials said 
more than 20 people were treated and released at hospitals for 
minor reactions to the fumes most for fume inhalation officials 
said 
chevron officials said they were monitoring air quality in the 
area of the leak since it was discovered in the early afternoon and 
described the gaseous release as a miminum health hazard that 
created a terrible odor 
most crude oils in texas have sulphur in them and that means 
their gas containes hydrogen sulfide which is listed as one of the 
hazardous chemicals said chevron spokesman art spencer 
hydrogen sulfide is a flammable poisonous gas with a 
characteristic odor of rotten eggs 
were doing continuous monitoring and were finding that 
theres nothing there that is hazardous to health and were also 
finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening 
spencer said 
but the odor got so strong that the city emergency response 
unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of it he 
said 
authorities described the evacuation as the largest in recent 
years in this coastal city a heavily industrial area near the 
louisiana border 
weve had some real bad fires at these plants where people were 
injured and killed but even then we never had an evacuation of this 
magnitude and ive been here 28 years said port arthur police 
sgt cedric clayton 
sgt mark blanton estimated late monday that 5000 to 7000 
people were evacuated from a densely populated 14 by 17block area 
on port arthurs west side about 3000 people were being housed at 
three schools that were opened as emergency shelters he said 
officials decided after a late meeting with chevron officials 
that the evacuation would continue until at least 7 am tuesday 
blanton said 
it appears the spill is under control but the odor is still 
present and were going to keep it evacuated until then he said 
adding that chevron tests show a mimimal amount of hydrogen sulfide 
is present 
at least 24 people were examined at local hospitals as a result 
of the leak officials said 
as far as im aware plans are just to treat and release 
them said doctors hospital spokesman dan bleyhl nobody 
suffered anything really bad 
a chevron employee discovered the leak around 130 pm monday 
officials said the leaking tank has a capacity of about 300000 
gallons but its exact content was not known because it was 
connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit 
spencer said 
crews were using vacuum trucks monday evening to remove the 
spilled crude from a ditch surrounding the tank but spencer 
estimated the task could take two or three days to complete

a cavein in a gold mine shaft killed 
three miners in this northeastern ontario city the mine manager 
said 
the three bodies were brought up from a depth of 1200 feet about 
five hours after mondays accident said robert perry general 
manager of the placer dome mine near the quebec border 
one member of a fourman mining crew who was above ground when 
the cavein occurred had reported his fellow miners missing perry 
said

a major tobacco company advertised its cigarettes 
as just what the doctor ordered at the same time it began a 
defense of smoking against growing evidence of serious health 
hazards according to newly released documents 
reports and memorandums passed between the research firm ad 
little inc and liggett amp myers tobacco co since the 1950s were 
gathered by a boston attorney in a 1987 liability suit against 
liggett and released by the us supreme court earlier this month 
more than 1200 pages of the documents reviewed by the associated 
press indicate that liggett officials knew their product posed a 
health hazard but that they denied the dangers to themselves 
smokers and the surgeon general 
the documents highlights of which were cited in the liability 
suit against liggett in newark nj by survivors of a heavy 
smoker prove nothing said liggett the maker of lampm and 
chesterfield cigarettes 
the charge that liggett suppressed information was rejected by 
the court and the jury said liggett attorney donald cohn in 
other words weve been through all this and it ended up a big zero 
and that was a 5month trial 
in that case a federal jury in june found liggett partly 
responsible for a smokers lung cancer and awarded 400000 to her 
widower antonio cipollone but the jury cleared liggett and two 
other cigarette makers lorillard inc and philip morris inc of 
conspiring to mislead the public about the risks of smoking 
clearly they liggett had enough evidence to conclude that the 
product was harmful to humans said dr gregory connolly head of 
massachusetts antismoking office 
they conducted counteradvertising programs to keep people 
smoking and they modified their products to allay public fear 
without producing anything safer weve paid an extremely heavy 
price in terms of human lives 
the documents show that after a 1954 review of existing studies 
ad little and liggett moved ahead with their own research and 
began often despite strong hints of hazards a long defense of 
smoking 
liggetts advertising in the 1950s included the line rosalind 
russell says lampm filters are just what the doctor ordered other 
ads proclaimed nose throat and accessory organs not adversely 
affected by smoking chesterfields and play safe smoke 
chesterfields 
when edward r murrow reported in 1954 that smoking appeared to 
cause lung cancer liggett asked ad little to put the damaging 
information into a more favorable light the response was three 
short statements to be read after an episode of dragnet 
before this year is ended about 20000 people in the united 
states will get lung cancer twice as many will probably die in 
automobile accidents one statement said there is no real proof 
that the smoking of cigarettes is a cause of lung cancer now there 
is only an association and a suspicion dont lets be fooled by 
mere suspicion 
ad little scientists prepared a paper for presentation at a 
private conference in june 1960 in durham nc the site of 
liggett headquarters that referred to statistics linking smoking 
with lung cancer and said data showing tobacco smoke caused skin 
cancer in laboratory animals are confirmed by experiments which 
were run in our own laboratories 
tobacco companies took the position that they could publicly deny 
any link between cancer and smoking as long as they could point to 
air pollution drinking or any other possible factor in cancer rates 
in humans said northeastern university law professor richard 
daynard leader of the tobacco liability project which tracks 
research and litigation on smoking 
on a legal level its outrageous theres a clear duty to 
warn he said 
the surgeon general released the first government report linking 
smoking to lung cancer heart disease and emphysema in 1964 
a february 1963 ad little inhouse draft on smoking and 
mortality rates prepared in anticipation of the surgeon generals 
report states that researchers felt there was a statistically 
significant not merely apparent relationship between cigarette 
smoking and death rates 
but liggett told the surgeon general in april 1963 that any 
assessment of the effects of cigarette smoking would be highly 
speculative

armenians are rebuilding their cities and towns 
hit by the dec 7 earthquake but it is proving harder for them to 
recover from the ethnic strife with neighboring azerbaijan that 
began a year ago a former moscow correspondent recently returned to 
an armenian village to gauge the aftermath of both upheavals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in this backward armenian village torn 
apart last year by bitter ethnic strife and a devastating 
earthquake the rival mountain people are finding it easier to mend 
bones than fences 
despite edicts from moscow that national differences be cast 
aside and despite the daunting task of postdisaster recovery the 
peasants of kursali are loathe to let go of the hate for 
azerbaijanis that has given them solace through severe tragedy 
the longsimmering hostility between armenians and azerbaijanis 
that broke open a year ago forced the 1100 residents of this 
ancient village to choose sides against friends and neighbors 
there had been little trouble here but in an excess of 
adherence to the adage that blood is thicker than water kursali 
came to typify the headlong rush into ethnic trauma that wracked 
armenia before the earthquake 
nearly 1000 armenians sought refuge here after rioting and 
murder in the azerbaijani port of sumgait some crowding into the 
hillside homes of relatives and others swapping the places they 
abandoned for stone hovels left behind by azerbaijanis made to pay 
for the crimes of their distant countrymen 
kursali was in the midst of such turmoil that officials have no 
clear idea how many people were here when the dec 7 earthquake 
struck destroying every dwelling and visiting death on every family 
for us every day is like the day of the earthquake its 
horrible said alavina mirzoyan whose husband was killed when the 
house across the rutted road tumbled into ruins with him inside 
she lives with her three children and two elderly inlaws at a 
cold windswept campsite among the rubble that used to be their home 
her sisterinlaw nora bagiryan contends the family cannot be 
evacuated because of bureaucratic tangles and the fact that they 
delayed leaving until her brothers body was found two weeks after 
the earthquake 
now theyve stopped evacuating people and look what these 
children must live with she lamented breaking into sobs 
with no longstanding ties to the area the family fears it will 
fall to the bottom of the housing allocation lists in the hands of 
officials of the closeknit villages surrounding spitak the city 
hit hardest by the earthquake 
the spitak regions mayor vresh adjyan showing west german red 
cross representatives the village they have proposed to rebuild 
conceded there has been a halt to evacuations but promised the 
family their plight would be addressed 
we came here on nov 13 after we traded our home in azerbaijan 
for this grigory bagiryan said motioning to a pile of twisted 
beams and shattered stone walls we dont have jobs here or a home 
or anything and the azerbaijanis are laughing at us 
only two ruined homes away akhmed gosanov tells a sad tale from 
the other side of the controversy 
the azerbaijani farmer lived all of his 65 years in the spacious 
stone home his grandfather built raising seven children and tending 
a prosperous plot of fruit trees 
but the armenians who had been his friends through life drove him 
and other azerbaijanis from the village when the flood of refugees 
arrived and ethnic hatred spread swiftly through the overwhelmed 
community 
the home was taken over by armenians but gosanov retains 
ownership of it and the rights to farm the land 
we never had any problems here the bewildered farmer said 
we want to live here but the armenians wont let us 
with his family safe in the azerbaijani city of kirovabad 
gosanov has been camped in freezing weather in a sod hut that he 
built in the corner of his property he makes daily forays into 
nearby spitak to plead for a fair price for his property and losses 
ive lived here all my life my father died here and my 
grandfather died here gosanov said and now the armenians are 
trying to throw me out 
the armenian officials of the spitak region have offered him only 
a fraction of what his rights to the private plot are worth he 
contends 
the ethnic conflict that has separated gosanov from his armenian 
neighbors stems from centuriesold differences and distrust between 
the christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis 
long suppressed by the official soviet facade of multinational 
brotherhood hostility broke open in the first days of 1988 when 
armenians began demonstrating in demand of annexation of a mostly 
armenian region of azerbaijan nagornokarabakh 
the protests were initially peaceful but counterdemonstrations 
by azerbaijanis turned violent on feb 28 zealots went on a 
rampage of atrocity killing 26 armenians and six others in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait 
interethnic turmoil rocked the caucasus mountain area 
intermittently throughout last year and the earthquake that killed 
25000 people did nothing to defuse the widespread tensions 
president mikhail s gorbachev lashed out at the demonstrators 
after a visit to the earthquakestricken area but in distant 
regions such as spitak and kursali the local officials can do little 
to soften the strife they often share the antimoslem sentiments of 
their fellow armenians 
kursali which is expected to be rebuilt this year likely will 
continue to be plagued with discontent as the homeless masses with 
rival claims to residence here struggle to rebuild and return to the 
old ways 
the armenian refugees from azerbaijan who were welcomed with 
open arms last year now are competing for the sturdy new homes to 
be built here claims of favoritism and injustice are expected to 
flourish when the houses are finished late this year 
spitak and nearby villages were evacuated after the earthquake 
but the injured are recovering and returning to see what of their 
lives is salvageable 
nothing is getting better said alexander gukasyan an 
armenian refugee from azerbaijan recuperating at a red cross field 
hospital in stepanavan another of the hardesthit cities the 
azerbaijanis continue to throw us out even when we have no place to 
go

breathe deeply to greet the day not in mexico 
city it has some of the dirtiest air in the world 
it burns the eyes and nose hides the spectacular snowcapped 
volcanoes outside the city and leaves tourists with a smell more 
memorable than the sights seen dimly through the haze 
doctors say the pall is a hazard for the metropolitan areas 19 
million residents and the public outcry has become loud enough to 
force at least some government action 
for all of us who live here it is shortening our lives said 
homero aridjis an writer of prose and poetry who speaks for the 
group of 100 artists and intellectuals an environmental protection 
group 
studies indicate athletes who exercise outdoors suffer reduced 
lung capacity patients with respiratory illnesses recover slowly 
embassies offer early retirement or weekends out of the smog 
schools closed in january one of the worst months for pollution 
since the middle of 1986 the question has been who is going to 
take responsibility for the effect this has on children said 
humberto bravo of the national universitys center for atmospheric 
studies who has been studying air pollution since the 1950s 
were not only contaminating more but it is increasing faster 
and in a way that is more damaging to health said ramon ojeda 
mestre director of pollution control 
pollution is not a top priority however for peasants who 
continue to arrive from the countryside in large numbers seeking 
work 
do you think they are going to be very worried about the 
environment when theyre at a subsistence level wondering what am i 
going to eat said margarita castillejos of the colegio de 
mexico a graduate school and think tank 
ozone the main contaminant is caused largely by automobile 
exhaust and exceeded mexicos acceptable level of 11 parts per 
million at least 323 days last year according to government records 
in los angeles synonymous with smog in the united states the 
ozone standard of 12 parts per million was violated on 174 days in 
1988 
mountains ring the valley of mexico and what goes into its air 
has a hard time getting out winds carry pollution from the 
industrial north of the valley to the residential south 
hernan cortes the spanish conqueror first saw tenochtitlan the 
citys aztec ancestor 35 miles away between the 17000foot peaks 
of popocatepetl and iztaccihuatl that was in november 1519 it 
seldom can be seen from that distance now 
officials and environmentalists blame the 3 million cars and 
other vehicles for 80 percent of the nearly 5 million tons of 
pollution expected this year 
few mexicans can afford new cars officials estimate 60 percent 
of those in the valley need repairs and 1 million more than nine 
years old 
the three chief polluters among the valleys 35000 industries 
are owned by the government an oil refinery in a densely populated 
neighborhood and two electric plants that burn heavy fuel oil 
adding to mexico citys pollution problems is its altitude of 
7400 feet which creates more pollution by preventing engines from 
burning fuel efficiently and abundant sunshine that causes a 
chemical reaction creating ozone 
wind adds other elements dust from dry lake beds and fecal 
matter and garbage particles from open air dumps 
the main problem doctors report is aggravation of asthma and 
other respiratory illnesses 
the children we are studying are going to be people who have 
chronic illnesses ms castillejos said they may not die but 
they arent going to have a healthy life 
norberto miranda torres a policemen on the busy paseo de la 
reforma said some officers have had to go to the doctor and it 
turned out that even their lungs were affected when they spit its 
black i have a friend they sent out of the city for 15 days on 
doctors orders 
dr daniel aguilar angeles of the governments general hospital 
said a patient from mexico city with respiratory or digestive 
illnesses is more difficult to treat than one from the provinces 
he doesnt respond to the treatments or responds badly said 
aguilar who heads an association studying pollution effects 
dr ruben shturman said a study he is conducting on athletes in a 
downtown park indicates at least onethird suffer respiratory 
impairment compared with less than 10 percent of the general 
population the air is so bad that making lungs more efficient is 
harmful he said 
the more they exercise the more polluted the air is the worse 
the potential for damage he said shturman works out on a 
treadmill and small trampoline in his lab with an air purifier 
going 
facing growing demand for action the government last year began 
auto emission checks and extended school christmas vacations through 
january 
a new program calls for better studies of contamination sources 
increased monitoring use of low sulfur fuels in the refinery and 
other facilities and better control of industrial emissions 
catalytic converters and unleaded gasoline will be phased in by 
the early 1990s officials say 
ojeda mestre the pollution control director said the program is 
expected to cut pollution this year by 20 percent

a young womans scathing public reply to a college 
students classified ad seeking a wife has touched off a heated 
public debate over the low social status of intellectuals in a 
country that once prized learning 
wielders of pens like you are less than beggars people like 
you who take the world prize for being behind the times are nothing 
but fools she wrote in a letter published in the zhejiang 
workers news where the lovelorn student placed his ad 
the tale was retold monday in the national newspaper for 
intellectuals the guangming daily neither the woman nor the 
student was identified 
learning is not food on the table ideals are not money to 
spend the woman wrote modern women eat money and people like 
you who wield pens and dont have money can only marry 50yearold 
housewives if you do marry a housewife advise your children not to 
go to school five years of elementary school is enough everyone 
nowadays uses calculators 
tell them to sell softshelled turtles an expensive 
delicacy and they can become multimillionaires 
the letter published in coastal zhejiang province late last 
year touched a sensitive spot in society the guangming daily 
said 
the zhejiang workers news was inundated with phone calls and 
nearly 700 letters from readers who agreed with the woman or offered 
consolation to the young man 
this view that learning has no value is just a temporary 
phenomenon wrote one reader shao guoqin 
but many teachers researchers and writers fear their low status 
has become a permanent feature of modern chinese society after 
centuries in which scholars ruled china and learning was the only 
way to advance those with college degrees have become one of the 
poorestpaid groups in cities 
a survey by the beijing statistics bureau last year found that 
college graduates earned an average of 9 less each month than 
illiterates 
most college professors earn far less than the 54 per month that 
is common for factory workers 
scholars traditional status first was undermined by mao 
tsetungs distrust of them and the revolutionary leaders emphasis 
on the wisdom of simple peasants 
since maos death in 1976 intellectuals no longer face attack as 
class enemies instead in a society newly concerned with making 
money they have watched inflation erode the spending power of their 
fixed salaries while factory workers have been encouraged with pay 
bonuses 
our brains are stuffed with learning but are our pockets 
jingling one college graduate wrote to the zhejiang workers 
news we can only haggle with the peddlers a penny for cabbage 
two cents for radishes women treat college students with disdain 
and some people in society look down on them isnt it because 
theres no money in studying 
surveys found that intellectuals have less leisure time than 
other urban residents and live an average of 58 years 10 years less 
than the national average due apparently to poor nutrition and hard 
work 
college students worried about their futures repeatedly have 
put up posters protesting the poor status of intellectuals 
the problem has been a theme of all student protests in recent 
years including rallies and a poster campaign last june at beijing 
university that began when a student was killed by a group of 
unemployed youths 
students also have protested by dropping out official reports 
said the number of undergraduates quitting school rose 45 percent 
last year while the number going on to postgraduate studies fell 75 
percent

when the curtain rises on the metropolitan 
operas twostory new production of salome it looks like a set 
for a kurt weill opera or maybe cabaret it cries out german 
decadence in the time the nazis came to power 
it doesnt make salome any more universal to set it in the 
century in which richard strauss composed it rather than in biblical 
times but it works even for an audience which has heard salome 
often before the production and eva marton as salome provided some 
chilling moments 
miss marton is exceptional her voice soars through dense 
orchestration mature technique gets her there but she keeps her 
voice sounding young 
salome is young and director nikolaus lehnhoff has directed 
carefully in that direction her acting conveys that salome doesnt 
understand the lust that draws her to john the baptist when he 
flings her from him she has childish tantrums 
after john the baptist is beheaded miss martons voice becomes 
maturesounding and she seems to be bragging about a kinky lust she 
now does understand 
two or three small excesses could be trimmed so the theatrical 
experience isnt broken by inappropriate laughter the stage is 
slanted but a woman pushed away by a man probably wouldnt roll over 
twice from the shove when miss marton starts her dance she removes 
the long pink gloves that match her girlish gown and twirls the 
gloves like a stripper before throwing them to herod 
richard cassilly sounded wagnerian as herod keeping a full voice 
centered to punch it authoritatively through the large orchestra 
helga dernesch was glamorous as salomes mother herodias mark 
baker sounded very good as narraboth the young guard captivated by 
salome he replaced neil rosenshein who was ill 
the set is like nothing else the met has seen the main stage 
looks like the basement of a castle with walls of black bricks a 
gate at the back and a rectangular hole in the floor the dungeon 
where john the baptist called jochanaan in the opera is kept 
bernd weikl sounded commanding as jochanaan but his standing 
against the gate arms outstretched like jesus on the cross was 
another effect used too often 
miss martons dance of the seven veils was a success she began 
with graceful arm motions and no veils in sight as she danced she 
removed the skirt of her dress and sheer underskirts throwing them 
into the dungeon she finished in a simple white dress 
marek janowski conducted superbly gil wechsler had spotlights 
follow principals through the general gloom and put two fixed 
spotlights on jochanaan lehnhoff from hannover germany was 
making his met directing debut set and costume designer jurgen 
rose a native of bernburgsaale east germany also made his met 
debut

jesse jackson made an appeal monday for the 
earliest possible parole of soul singer james brown saying 
brown had been a model prisoner and an inspiration to others 
jackson met with brown for more than 90 minutes to discuss the 
singers health his trouble with the law and his stay at the state 
park correctional institute near columbia 
the rev al sharpton a selfstyled civil rights activist from 
new york and longtime protege of brown met jackson at the airport 
sharpton asked to join the meeting with brown but south carolina 
corrections officials refused 
neither sharpton nor jackson was not on browns list of approved 
visitors but jackson had received prior permission authorities 
said the chicago minister and south carolina native said he wanted 
to meet with brown and learn more about the case 
he said he had spoken with gov carroll campbell and sen strom 
thurmond rsc to see what could be done for brown 
jackson said his intention was not to criticize any of the legal 
aspects surrounding the case including the sixyear sentence brown 
received 
the appeal really is for mercy jackson said 
he said he also wanted to clear up misconceptions about browns 
convictions jackson said brown is concerned that the public 
mistakenly thinks he was charged with the use or possession of drugs 
and that he shot at police 
brown in a statement read by jackson said i am not on 
drugs 
the 55yearold entertainer who lives in beech island is 
serving a sixyear sentence at the minimumsecurity prison after 
being convicted in january of an array of charges stemming from a 
twostate highspeed chase on sept 24 
judge hubert long said then that brown must undergo examination 
and treatment for any drug or alcohol problem he might have as part 
of his sentence on the south carolina conviction brown was 
convicted in georgia and south carolina 
authorities said the chase began after brown disrupted an 
insurance seminar in an augusta ga office building by walking in 
with a shotgun before officers could arrive brown left the 
building and a chase began 
brown pleaded guilty in georgia to having no state license tag 
reckless driving driving with a suspended license attempting to 
flee or elude police carrying a deadly weapon to a public 
gathering simple assault and improper lane change 
he was fined 1000 and given a sixyear sentence that runs 
concurrently with the sixyear sentenced he received in south 
carolina for failing to stop for authorities during the chase 
brown will be eligible for parole in south carolina in august 
1991 but georgia authorities say their state law provides brown 
must serve until march 10 1992 on the sixyear sentence before he 
would be eligible for parole 
jackson said prison officials told him brown was an inspiration 
to other prisoners and to corrections department employees 
brown is popular with other inmates said francis archibald 
director of the south carolina department of corrections some 
prisoners have had their pictures taken with the man who is known as 
the godfather of soul archibald said 
brown works in the kitchen and sings in a church choir at the 
center he said

the tribe circled in a ritual dance then sat to applaud as the 
men women and children of each subsequent tribe arrived for a week 
of debates speeches and other events 
for the first time amazon tribes were together to discuss common 
concerns 
the indians are protesting the proposed kararao and babaquara 
dams on the amazons xingu river if built the reservoirs would 
flood about 3000 square miles of jungle displacing 7000 of the 
220000 indians who remain in brazil 
about 5 million indians roamed the country when the portuguese 
arrived in the 1500s and settled what is now south americas 
largest nation 
anthropologists have expressed fears about the indians continued 
survival as hundreds of thousands of nonindian homesteaders 
ranchers and prospectors stream into the amazon annually chopping 
and burning away the rain forest and ignoring demarcations of native 
tribal areas 
we want the government to rethink the dams jorge terena of 
the terena tribe told a cheering crowd packed into the community 
center the land is sacred to us it has the roots of our culture 
and our ancestors 
we will not accept the dams said david yanomami of the 
primitive yanomami tribe the river will rise the fish will die 
the game will move away 
later in the day thousands of farmers and local shopowners 
marched through altamira a town of 38000 carrying placards saying 
dams mean more jobs and more progress and gringos leave us in 
peace 
i know the indians will have problems but im in favor of the 
dams said raimundo castro bastos owner of an altamira bar i 
believe the dams will bring development and progress for us 
government and industry leaders say the energy provided by the 
dams is vital for the growth of this third world nation 
the government representative to the meeting fernando mesquita 
president of the brazilian environment institute spoke to whistles 
and boos from the crowd which included native indian leaders from 
around the world hundreds of foreign and brazilian 
environmentalists and droves of journalists 
we recognize that great indignities were committed against the 
indian people but now it is a question of national awareness we 
are here to listen mesquita said 
the late december shooting death of internationallyknown amazon 
ecologist francisco mendes who fought against the destruction of 
the rain forest by ranchers increased international awareness of 
the movement to preserve the jungle and protect its native peoples 
environmentalists are concerned that slash burning of the rain 
forest is contributing to the warming of world temperatures and 
destroying both a vital source of oxygen and an important habitat 
for animal and plant life 
the ecologists are trying to discourage foreign lending 
institutions from putting money into brazilian development projects 
considered harmful to the enviroment and native peoples 
foreign governments and environmental groups have for example 
proposed that brazil swap part of its 115 billion foreign debt for 
promises to preserve parcels of jungle territory 
president jose sarney for his part has said he doesnt want any 
meddling in domestic affairs by foreigners

president augusto pinochet says that 
although the constitution prevents him from running for reelection 
he will still pick the candidate he wants to succeed him and will 
not step down as army chief 
im going to tell you soon whom we must support in 
presidential balloting scheduled for dec 14 the rightwing general 
told cheering supporters on sunday in temuco 370 miles south of 
santiago 
lets stay together lets not quarrel among ourselves the 
72yearold army commander said in his speech carried by santiago 
newspapers on monday we should not yield the field to those other 
gentlemen in the opposition 
congressional elections also will be held dec 14 
the temuco speech quickly drew fire from opposition leaders who 
called pinochets remarks a threat to any future elected government 
pinochet was ending an eightday tour of southern chile during 
which he made clear that he plans to retain a key role in chile once 
he steps down from the presidency in march 1990 
the 55000men army is by far the most powerful of the armed 
services and the key to pinochets hold of power for more than 15 
years 
under a 1980 militarywritten constitution pinochet is allowed 
to remain army commander for eight years after leaving the 
presidency he must hand power over on march 11 1990 to the winner 
of the december election 
andres zaldivar vice president of the centrist christian 
democratic party said monday of pinochets remarks thats 
unacceptable pinochet should leave the army as a gesture of 
dignity 
pinochet took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the 
elected government of salvador allende a marxist who died in the 
takeover 
pinochet was obliged to call the elections after losing an oct 5 
referendum in which he sought voters approval to remain in power 
until 1997 
after the referendum defeat the propinochet forces split at 
least two politicians formally announced their candidacies for 
president and conservative business leaders are actively promoting 
the nomination of pinochets 39yearold finance minister hernan 
buchi 
several small groups also asked that a formula be found probably 
a constitutional amendment to allow pinochet to run he insists 
however he definitely will not be a candidate the constitution 
bars him from running 
but pinochet has made it clear that he plans to play an active 
role in the campaign and the election by telling his followers for 
whom to vote 
the opposition says it plans to seek a single presidential 
candidate leaders of a coalition of 17 opposition parties are 
scheduled to pick the nominee next month among at least four 
contenders 
patricio aylwin a former senate president is considered the 
frontrunner 
aylwin is president of the christian democrats the largest 
opposition party and was the oppositions chief spokesman during 
the campaign for the referendum

the peoples daily the voice of the communist 
party and chinas leading newspaper is trying out a new look in an 
attempt to win back readers by giving them more of the news that 
interests them 
the paper has seen its circulation fall 20 percent a year 
recently currently 4 million papers are printed a day the most of 
any daily in china but only 2 percent of subscribers are private 
citizens 
in a frontpage letter monday to its readers the paper said the 
change would increase the amount and the timeliness of news it also 
said it would work to reflect the opinion of the people and help 
employ public opinion to bring our paper closer to the masses 
closer to life 
not bad for day one said a retired official as he read the 
paper in downtown beijing i guess you could say its glasnost 
with chinese characteristics 
in the past the paper has been filled with reports about 
bureaucrats opening a meeting here and closing one there tidbits of 
important information were often buried 
breaking news such as plane crashes and important government 
decisions was either not reported or published late and with scant 
details the paper paid infinite attention to theoretical issues of 
little import to everyday life 
many chinese used to read the paper to gauge the latest shift in 
the political wind but as the society has become more concerned 
with economic development than ideology the papers usefulness 
and its readership has diminished 
mondays editions differed from previous weeks but only slightly 
international news was displayed on page one several breaking 
stories were reported with current details an unusual report 
appeared on the status of chinas military draft more photographs 
lined the pages 
they wouldnt have had this a while ago said kang kexing 
pointing to a story about hundreds of fishermen illegaly trawling 
for eels on the yangtze river before theyd only report it after 
it ended 
a companion story asked the agriculture ministry for reaction 
telephone interview by the paper read the headline 
they seem to be showing off here said kang very pleased 
with themselves for reporting this so soon 
other readers pointed to a story on salman rushdies apology to 
moslems angered by his book the satanic verses 
in the past it seemed that the only international news we got 
were things almost directly related to china said one reader 
this has nothing to do with china that seems to be a change and 
a good one 
the changes are limited however the peoples daily like all 
chinas papers and publications remains run by a government very 
concerned with what is read by its people 
newspaper officials interviewed monday said they believed the 
change would help the circulation which has dropped further since 
january when the paper doubled in price to about 5 cents 
readers on the street were less enthusiastic 
theres no comparison between this and some of the other 
papers said yang gong a 23yearold university student 
indeed the peoples daily is by far the stodgiest of the four 
dailies with the highest circulation in china 
the no 2 paper the workers daily although generally 
conservative occasionaly comes out in favor of greater power for 
the staterun labor union next in line the legal daily often is 
filled with lurid stories of murders and rapes 
the no 4 paper china youth news is one of the most interesting 
publications in china over the last seven months it has written on 
labor strife prostitution homosexuality and the uses of liquor for 
bribery 
the peoples daily was boring before and its boring now 
said chen daqin a worker in his 20s as he peered against a glass 
case holding mondays editions on bustling wangfujing street 
theyve changed the soup but the prescriptions the same

more industries must conduct joint research 
with government support to cope with foreign competitors in 
critical electronics areas a panel of industry academic and 
government experts recommends 
the survival of the us industrial base in vital electronics 
sectors is at stake said a statement issued after a workshop 
meeting last week held under the aegis of the institute of 
electrical and electronics engineers 
it said participants at the workshop had reached a consensus that 
to address the problem we endorse industryled consortia with 
government cooperation and support 
the ieee is a new yorkbased professional association with more 
than 250000 members worldwide 
john richardson chairman of the ieees committee on 
communications and information policy said the consortia envisioned 
by the panel would go beyond efforts currently being mounted by 
sematech a consortium of us companies developing advanced 
technology for computer chipmaking 
consortia similar to sematech are needed because sematech alone 
will not do the whole job he said sematech is a good start 
but that only addresses one part of the industry 
during last weeks meeting richardson said it was explored as 
to how far along the spectrum of research development 
manufacturing and commercialization these consortia should go the 
consensus was that they certainly should stop short of 
commercialization 
the workshop involving about 60 participants from industry 
academia and government was held feb 14 at the washington 
headquarters of the national research council 
a majority of the workshops participants agreed that the 
situation involving foreign competition was serious but they 
decided to shy away from estimating specifically how much it will 
cost to turn things around 
there was widespread if not unanimous agreement that the us 
electronic industries are in deep trouble that there is a fighting 
chance to recover that this will have its costs and that these 
costs will be nontrivial but there was a reluctance at this early 
stage to mention a dollar figure for government support or private 
investment richardson said 
alan mcadams an economics professor at cornell universitys 
johnson graduate school of manageent said the panel put most 
emphasis on developing initiatives in three areas highdefinition 
television advanceddesign memory chips and highresolution 
computer systems 
we think that these initiatives will have enormous benefits to 
the domestic economy mcadams said one trouble with talking 
about cost is that people forget about benefits we believe that 
whatever we recommend will have payoffs manyfold greater than 
cost 
the workshop stressed the importance of developing dualuse 
technologies that meet both civilian and military needs 
mcadams noted that the defense advanced research projects agency 
has committed about 30 million and put out a call for proposals in 
the area of highresolution computer systems 
we applaud the fact that theyve acted quickly and that they 
recognize that these are multiuse technologies with both military 
and civilian implications he said 
participants at the workshop also looked for government support 
of the electronics initiatives from the commerce departments 
national institute of standards and technology 
last weeks meeting followed a position statement adopted jan 25 
by the ieees technology activities council 
the statement said that the united states must immediately 
reestablish significant technological capability and domestic 
manufacturing of worldclass products by usowned firms based on 
electronic and related technologies that serve both civilian and 
military purposes 
the situation is critical it said a proactive stance by 
the federal government is required if these goals are to be 
achieved

when president bush arrives in japan for the 
funeral of emperor hirohito a parade of kings presidents and prime 
ministers will begin streaming into the us embassy in tokyo for a 
chat with him 
during bushs twoday stay as many as 15 to 20 foreign leaders 
will have an audience with him 
funerals may be the most convenient way for meetings of heads 
of state says robert a scalapino director of the institute of 
east asian studies at the university of california at berkeley 
funerals seem to be a place where people can meet without too 
much being written into it scalapino wrote recently it doesnt 
seem contrived 
john f kennedys funeral provided the setting for many 
highlevel meetings in washington likewise the funeral in moscow 
of soviet leader leonid brezhnev provided an opportunity for 
meetings of heads of state 
many of the dignitaries bush will see have talked with him during 
his eight years as vice president but there is a big difference 
now bush is no longer the understudy 
first on the visitors list will be french president francois 
mitterrand 
bush arriving in tokyo after a flight of more than 15 hours 
will go directly to the us embassy for a luncheon meeting with 
mitterrand as he dines with the french leader bushs body clock 
will tell him it is about midnight wednesday in washington but in 
tokyo it will be about 2 pm thursday 
bush is expected to nap on air force one on the way to asia to 
help adjust to the 14hour time difference 
blocks of time have been set aside for other meetings on thursday 
night friday afternoon and saturday morning 
the entire list of bushs visitors has not been released but his 
guests are expected to include several mideast leaders jordans 
king hussein egyptian president hosni mubarak and israeli president 
chaim herzog 
others who will see bush are pakistans prime minister benazir 
bhutto president suharto of indonesia president corazon aquino of 
the philippines king juan carlos of spain and president mobuto sese 
seku of indonesia 
bush also will meet with japanese prime minister noboru takeshita 
at akasaka palace and with emperor akihito at the imperial palace 
in compiling bushs guest list white house officials considered 
the nature of relations with countries whose leaders expressed an 
interest in seeing the president officials said 
they also looked at whether there were shared interests as well 
as whether there was a past personal relationship 
white house officials consulted with japanese officials to make 
sure they would not take offense at bush for using the occasion of 
the funeral for private meetings 
we checked with the japanese and they said it was perfectly 
correct to do so said a white house official in fact the 
official said the japanese are pleased that tokyo will be the site 
of such highlevel meetings 
the president will receive dignitaries one by one at the american 
embassy across the street from the okura hotel where hes staying 
most of the meetings will run between 20 to 30 minutes longer if 
translations are necessary 
immediately after his last bilateral meeting saturday bush will 
depart for a twonight stay in china the second country on a 
threenation journey 
the los angeles times reported today that while bush is in 
beijing he plans to meet with chinese human rights activist fang 
lizhi the times quoted sources as saying fang has been invited to a 
reception that bush will attend sunday at the american embassy in 
beijing 
fang an outspoken critic of the chinese communist party is an 
internationally recognized astrophysicist and has often been 
compared to soviet dissident andrei sakharov the meeting would mark 
the first time that a us president has met with a chinese 
dissident in beijing 
the president also will stop briefly in south korea before 
returning to washington monday night 
white house officials are playing down expectations of major 
developments from the talks 
they are largely a renewal of acquaintances or introductions 
discussions of broad topics of mutual interests one official said 
you cant expect too much substantial accomplishment or 
resolution of thorny issues in a 20 to 30 minute meeting the 
official added

actual wreck itself 
he said a helicopter had been dispatched to the site 
the area around the base was hit by strong thunderstorms and 
flashes of lighting through much of the night air force officials

the crash 
the plane crashed in a forested swamp in the middle of the 
testing range at eglin the air forces headquarters for nonnuclear 
arms testing the spokesman said 
theyve found one of the engines in a creek said lynn 
jurkovic a dispatcher at the nearby fort walton beach fire

in the 1960s leo whalen watched a news 
report about the home of the nations 36th president and decided 
that lyndon b johnsons ranch needed a few ducks 
so he wrote a letter and proposed a trade mallards to put in the 
water on johnsons property in exchange for a lone star lbj ranch 
hat 
it seems that you have a deal lbjs aide earl deathe jr 
replied 
the presidential pact was a feather in whalens cap but no big 
deal for his whistling wings inc beak broker to the world the 
whalen family is to mallards what the wrigleys are to gum only more 
so 
each year 200000 mallards are born in this town of 1100 which 
lies 10 miles east of the mississippi river in the northwestern 
corner of illinois theyre sold to conservation groups university 
researchers hunting clubs foreign palaces and even a few 
restaurants around the globe 
we originally started as a hunting club but it never really 
got off the ground said the founders son bill whalen who 
shares duckkeeping duties with his sister marianne whalen murphy 
dad brought the idea home from europe after world war ii but 
at that time we were too far from any major city to draw hunters so 
we diversified and simply went into raising the birds he said 
because mallards are the most popular hunting ducks whistling wings 
stuck with them 
weve grown up with it says mrs murphy and its grown 
with us when you pick up the phone you never know who youre 
going to be talking to 
once it was a caller from japan inquiring about ducks for 
emperor hirohito chilean officials asked if they could send a plane 
to get some eggs and the brookfield zoo in suburban chicago bought 
a duck each week for an 11foot anaconda snake 
it just wouldnt take anything else said zoo reptile curator 
ray pawley 
whistling wings has 4000 breeding ducks each hen produces at 
least 40 eggs that hatch in incubators after 27 days 
ducks sell for 155 to 1550 depending on the age of the duck 
and size of the order younger ducks cost less 
mrs murphy and her brother deal ducks out of a small office in 
the center of hanover a few miles south near the town sign that 
welcomes travelers to the worlds mallard duck capital is the 
farm where ducks are kept in pens during late fall and winter 
when the weather turns warm most newborn mallards are driven to 
a chain of small private lakes on 300 hilly acres in jo daviess 
county 
we want to raise them in their own environment bill whalen 
explained as he took a visitor around the scenic duck territory icy 
and bare in winter 
by truck or plane theyre shipped to 48 states and points beyond 
sometimes unintentionally 
mom took some into chicago once for a flight to florida mrs 
murphy said the plane was hijacked to cuba onethousand birds 
headed to tallahassee became cuban ducks

mexico has asked washington to abandon its 
plan to dig a ditch near san diego along a fourmile stretch of 
border that drug smugglers and illegal immigrants now cross in 
vehicles 
us officials have said the 8footdeep 14footwide ditch was 
originally planned to improve drainage along the border on the 
relatively flat otay mesa 
but more recently they said it could also discourage narcotics 
traffickers and illegal aliens from crossing the border in cars and 
trucks on friday us immigration and naturalization service 
commissioner alan nelson said construction could begin within two 
months and should be completed by summer 
in a statement late monday the foreign ministry asked the state 
department to abandon plans to dig the ditch and immediately begin 
a study of other alternatives that would permit a quick and 
acceptable solution to the problem of flood waters on the otay 
mesa 
ministry officials reacted with surprise in late january to news 
reports that one purpose of the planned ditch would be to deter drug 
smugglers and illegal immigrants 
they said they had only been told the ditch about 25 miles 
southeast of downtown san diego was meant to improve drainage 
the project has since been criticized by people on both sides of 
the border some have likened it to the berlin wall and several 
mexican congressmen called it an unfriendly gesture 
immigration officials say the isolated otay mesa is the most 
popular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1950mile 
usmexico border 
about onethird of the 12 million illegal immigrants seized in 
the united states last year were rounded up on the mesa officials 
say up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegally 
into san diego each month 
the foreign ministry statement came three days after nelson told 
a meeting of mexican and us governors from border states that the 
ditch would prevent illegal drugs and aliens from entering the 
united states 
but he emphasized that its primary purpose would be drainage 
i hope it will be understood for what it is and what it is not 
at no time was there an intent to send a negative message to 
mexico he said during the 7th international border governors 
conference in the northern city of saltillo

the tokyo stock exchanges leading stock index today 
plunged from its latest record high and the dollar gained sharply 
against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 19700 points or 061 
percent closing at 3198008 that was its first closing below the 
32000yen level since feb 14 when it ended at 3198289 
it had set a record high closing of 3217708 on monday 
the plunge in the index resulted mainly from the dollars quick 
rise on the foreign exchange market said an analyst with nomura 
securities japans largest brokerage 
he also said prospects for a tighter economic policy in the 
united states possibly leading to higher interest rates 
discouraged investors from buying stock while awaiting congressional 
testimony by us federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
scheduled later today 
expectations of higher interest rates generally discourage stock 
buying the analyst added 
in addition he said institutional investors feared the nikkei 
had risen too high recently and were selling to take profits 
in active trading with first section volume estimated at 12 
billion shares steel and real estate shares were among losers 
in currency dealings the dollar closed at 12715 yen up 140 
yen from mondays 12575yen finish the dollar opened at 12660 
yen its low for the day and went as high as 12735 yen 
the dollars sharp rise was prompted by expectations of greenspan 
suggesting a tighter us economic policy later today dealers said 
higher us interest rates tend to make dollardenominated 
investments more attractive to foreigners 
some traders avoided major moves before greenspans testimony

engraved hatchets hidden in the woods as part of an athol tradition

lovestruck 
the yearling moose appeared in the area thursday and moved close 
to john calderwoods farm sunday 
hes not going to leave now calderwood said monday 
calderwood and a state game warden believe the moose is male but 
they dont think it has amorous intentions 
the game warden said he probably wandered off from his mother 
and is lonely said calderwood who raises horses on his burnt 
swamp farm 
the mares arent fond of the onlooker and move to the far side of 
their enclosed pasture whenever the moose approaches the fence he 
said 
theyre not letting him out of their sight calderwood added 
calderwood said he isnt feeding the animal because he doesnt 
want to encourage it to stick around he said he hopes the moose 
will depart before his mares begin going into heat in the next three 
weeks 
if a vermont farmers experience in october 1986 is any guide 
calderwood could have a long wait a lovesick moose wandered onto 
larry carraras farm in shrewsbury vt became enamored with his 
hereford cow jessica and stayed for 76 days the romance attracted 
attention worldwide and prompted a nashville tenn man to write a 
song about the unlikely couple

an effort to have the magpie declared the 
state bird was beaten back by ruffled lawmakers but only after a 
legislator proposed a unique designation state scavenger 
state sen bill yellowtail extolled the magpies virtues in 
pushing a bill to have it replace the meadowlark as the state bird 
he said the magpie is selfsufficient and hardy like montanans 
and praised it for staying in the state during bad weather as well 
as good unlike the migrating meadowlark 
the meadowlark right now reclines on a bahama beach bedecked 
in sunglasses and bermuda shorts and drinking a mint julep 
yellowtail said 
but other lawmkers denounced the magpies eating habits and its 
noisy chattering 
sen judy jacobson said legislators who live in the capital for 
part of the year shouldnt criticize those who head south for the 
winter 
where would you be living today if people in helena didnt go 
south for the winter she asked wed all be in tents on the 
capitol lawn 
jacobson suggested the meadowlark retain its post and the magpie 
be designated as the state scavenger a move the senate approved 
3414 
id like to honor both of these birds in the way that they 
ought to be honored she said

corrupt officials in chinas army are recruiting 
epileptics criminals schizophrenics deaf mutes and people who 
cant read threatening the modernization of the army the nations 
leading newspaper says 
the report monday in the peoples daily was one of several in the 
staterun press recently on the difficulties of drafting and keeping 
good soldiers 
they have appeared as the peoples liberation army gets ready for 
its annual draft which was moved up this year from autumn to march 
1 
an army with no education is a stupid army the peoples 
daily said in todays world where military science is flying 
ahead a stupid army will fail 
last week the liberation army daily ran two stories on how a 
thief and rapist became a soldier after his father gave the wife of 
a military official a job the articles said such occurrences are 
common 
mondays peoples daily cited one regiment in which 433 men 
claimed to have a high school level education when they were given 
a test only 4 percent passed and 37 percent got a grade of zero 
of the 150 new conscripts another company got last year the 
majority were gamblers fighters thieves and hooligans the 
report said one man was wanted for murder another for escaping 
from jail one headed a criminal organization 
in one division 200 of the 733 soldiers were shorter than the 
5foot3 cutoff point 
deaf mutes sick people also become soldiers the report 
said schizophrenics epileptics are also not rare 
everybody in my county fills in the draft form the same way 
said one illiterate soldier when asked why he claimed to have a high 
school education on his draft card we fill it in as we wish and 
whatever we say thatll do for the truth i cant write so i had my 
cousin fill it in 
a western military analyst said the annual draft was moved up 
this year to force soldiers to undergo an extra winter training 
period in their three years of service the extra exercises will 
help in the selection of officers and strengthen the militarys weak 
winter fighting capacity he said 
conscription is supposed to play a key role in chinas program to 
modernize its military and abandon chinese leader mao tsetungs 
philosophy for guerrilla warfare peoples war 
under that strategy china threw the largest number of people in 
the smallest amount of space and tried to overwhelm its enemy but 
heavy losses suffered in 1979 during a border war with vietnam 
signaled its death knell 
reforms in the last nine years have cut at least 1 million men 
from the military leaving fewer than 3 million in uniform 
standards for new soldiers have been raised today 70 percent of 
divisional leaders have college educations compared with 16 
percent in 1982 
china started buying advanced weapons from the west and 
developing its own arms industry last year it reinstituted a 
ranking system after a 23year ban and elite fighting squads began 
practice 
serious problems have developed in the draft however 
attracted by the opportunites available under current economic 
reforms many men dont want to be soldiers others who lack the 
educational cultural or physical standards still look to the 
military as a way out of the countryside 
the military is in a bind said the military attache who 
spoke on condition of anonymity the only people who want to be 
soldiers are hillbillies but the system has changed no more is it 
just a rifle and a sleeping bag and off you go sunshine 
corruption is rife as thousands of qualified men bribe officials 
to let them out of military service and others who dont qualify pay 
to get in 
in addition the defense budget has been cut drastically from 
about 175 percent of all state expenditures in 1978 to 8 percent 
today many officers want early retirement to seek their fortunes 
elsewhere

bill baird says hes more worried than at any other 
time during the 26 years hes fought for birth control and abortion 
rights 
baird fears that his work which led in part to the 1973 supreme 
court decision legalizing abortion may swiftly come undone and 
hes concerned that no one understands whats at stake in the 
growing battle between anti and proabortion activists 
i see war predicted baird i see that this nation has a 
real potential to turn into northern ireland unless people take 
seriously this holy war being waged 
baird 56 believes women are about to lose important civil 
rights allowing them to have abortions and to choose birthcontrol 
devices he views the onslaught against abortion as the result of an 
aggressive rightwing agenda initially promoted by the reagan 
administration 
the real root of the antiabortion movement is to keep women at 
home waiting with the pipe and slippers he said its called 
control 
baird says he began his crusade in the early 1960s when a woman 
died in his arms after a selfinflicted abortion attempt with an 
eightinch coat hanger baird believes that american women may be 
forced to return to that era 
i grieve over the fact that america seems fast asleep at the 
wheel baird said during a recent interview at his counseling and 
referral clinic in boston americans should wake up and learn that 
freedom isnt free 
despite his years battling antiabortion activists baird has 
never taken a public stance on the morality of choosing an abortion 
and i never will he said we men have been telling women 
what to do for too long when im asked the question in debates i 
always say ill never get pregnant it isnt up to men to decide 
for women 
baird often travels with a voluminous file of old press clippings 
that detail his brushes with the law like his 1967 arrest for 
distributing contraceptives to boston university students 
for a man closely associated with the oncerevolutionary concept 
of sexual freedom baird leads a nearmonastic life 
he has lived 400 miles apart from his wife and four children for 
almost 15 years the decision to live separately came after his 
children became the target of death threats baird moved them to an 
undisclosed town somewhere in new england and lives alone behind a 
sixfoot high fence on new yorks long island 
bairds two other counseling clinics are in hempstead and 
hauppage on long island his clinics do not offer abortions because 
they became too expensive to perform he said 
baird said he is painfully lonely and admitted that his 
children harbor some resentment over his work and the familys 
separation 
but nothing can stay him from his crusade he said he recently 
worked night and day on behalf of a comatose new york woman who was 
allowed by a judge to have an abortion earlier this month over the 
objection of antiabortion activists 
i see myself as the candle that lights the darkness of 
ignorance and sexism baird said i dont have much money but 
im the most stubborn man youll ever meet in your life 
baird is most bitter about a 1971 incident in which he gave a 
lecture on birth control before an audience that included a mother 
and her 14month old child and was arrested for corrupting a minor 
he also served three months in prison for distributing 
contraceptives he said he still remembers how i felt standing in 
the ashes after his hempstead clinic was firebombed in 1979 
he has been shot at spat at and reviled even by some feminists 
but he will not be deterred 
i will die fighting this cause he said i eat sleep and 
breathe your rights

southwest of seattle and registered 30 on the richter scale the 
center said 
the quake was felt in the south seattle suburbs of federal way 
renton enumclaw and skyway the center said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase

many of the first visitors to a new museum at the 
former texas school book depository went directly to the sixthfloor 
spot where lee harvey oswald allegedly fired the shots that killed 
president kennedy 
it took me back that view it really did said pat radmacher 
of granbury one of 1700 people who visited the sixth floor museum 
which opened during the presidents day holiday monday in what is now 
the dallas county administration building 
the southeast corner has been made to appear as it did when 
oswald ate lunch there nov 22 1963 waiting for kennedys 
motorcade visitors may not share oswalds perch which has been 
sealed off with glass but see a view of elm street close to it 
i got a big lump in my throat when i saw this window said 
danny veno of dallas ive waited a long time to see this a long 
long time 
the 9000squarefoot exhibit organized by the dallas county 
historical foundation contains 350 photographs 30 artifacts a 
30minute audio tour and six films running a total of 40 minutes 
our purpose is not to preserve the memory of that death 
dallas county judge lee f jackson said at a dedication ceremony 
it is not in our power to preserve what already lives so 
powerfully any more than we could erase or escape this history 
the lessons of history found here will be passed like a torch 
to all generations 
about 26 years ago america was wounded said the rev g 
james christopher of the st mark african methodist episcopal zion 
church but today we stand here whole again 
dallas residents often have debated whether there should be 
official recognition of the kennedy assassination in the city where 
he was killed 
the sixth floor christopher said shows dallas has finally 
reconciled the pain of the past with the promise of hope for the 
future 
although it was packed with people the museum was very quiet 
save for some small talk and a couple of children asking quesions 
fouryearold jeremy livingston looked up at his father jerome 
livingston a computer programmer from new york 
why would anyone want to kill a president the boy asked

iran recalled all its ambassadors from 
common market countries today a day after the 12 european countries 
recalled their envoys to protest ayatollah khomeinis execution 
order against novelist salman rushdie 
the move by the foreign ministry was in direct reponse to the 
common market foreign ministers decision in brussels belgium on 
monday to recall their ambassadors from tehran the official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
irna did not specify the countries from which the iranian 
ambassadors were withdrawn and it was not immediately known in what 
common market countries iran has maintained ambassadors 
in britain for example tehran has been represented by a charge 
daffaires 
irans foreign ministry said in a statement that respect for 
islam and its values will remain an inviolable principle in 
relations between iran and other countries irna said 
the communique said that khomeinis weekold order for rushdies 
death for blaspheming islam with his book the satanic verses was 
a consensus judgement of all moslem leaders throught the world 
the agency reported 
the dispatch monitored in nicosia said the foreign ministry 
deplored the refusal of the european community to condemn the book 
and criticized the communitys support for a work it said blasphemes 
islam 
britain announced monday it would withdraw all its diplomats from 
tehran and request that iran recall its representatives in london 
khomeini had refused to accept rushdies apology for offending 
moslems with the book affirming his call for moslems to kill the 
naturalized briton who is reportedly in hiding under police guard 
britain stopped short of actually severing ties while its 
partners in the common market said they would recall their envoys 
for consultations 
many moslems say the satanic verses portrays the prophet 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggests that he rather than 
god wrote the koran islams holy book 
the novel has been banned in pakistan bangladesh iran india 
egypt and south africa publishers in france west germany greece 
and turkey have canceled plans to publish it and it has been pulled 
from bookstore shelves in japan many us bookstores have also 
removed the novel from display 
the novel has also prompted moslem protests around the world in 
pakistan and india earlier this month seven people were killed in 
protests against it

an experimental bonemarrow transplant that ended 
in death five years ago for david the boy in the plastic 
bubble is helping other children with the same immune system 
disorder to survive without isolation 
his life certainly had an impact on mankind if only our lives 
could have as much of an impact said dr william shearer davids 
primary physician at texas childrens hospital 
david was born with severe combined immune deficiency syndrome 
or scids a disorder that left him without protection against 
disease at the time children with the disorder died because there 
was no treatment 
doctors placed david in a clear plastic bubble immediately after 
birth and increasingly bigger bubbles as he grew to protect him from 
germs while researchers worked on a treatment 
david whose family name was never released to the public died 
feb 22 1984 of blood cancer contracted shortly after he underwent 
a bonemarrow transplant designed to free him from the bubble 
no other child lived like david and because of the treatment 
there has not been another bubble boy 
today at texas childrens hospital many children with scids are 
being treated successfully with the improved transplant treatment 
shearer said a handful of hospitals across the country also perform 
the transplant 
gone are the strict sterile conditions that made david a prisoner 
of his disorder children with the condition stay in the hospital 
before and after transplant visitors need only wash their hands and 
be healthy 
scids also is being identified earlier thanks to pediatricians 
who are more aware of the disorder when they see children who 
have unusual infections they think maybe this child has a similar 
problem to david shearer said 
about one out of 100000 babies have scids 
the treatment involves taking about a quart of bone marrow from a 
donor either a sibling or a parent and injecting it into a vein 
if the transplant is successful cells known as lymphocytes in the 
marrow form the core of a healthy immune system 
sixteen children have been treated at texas childrens in the 
past five years including one boy who successfully underwent the 
procedure while david was dying eleven are still alive 
threemonthold ana ruth calderon was released from the hospital 
three weeks ago after receiving a marrow transplant 
she is fat and sassy doing well shearer said 
shearer said neither he nor davids parents look back at whether 
anything could have been done differently 
they went for a chance at the time when the technology was 
right the doctor said and for one reason or another it worked 
out in a very sad way

president mikhail s gorbachev will for the first 
time visit the chernobyl power plant site of the worlds worst the 
nuclear disaster during his current trip to the ukraine radio 
moscow reported today 
gorbachev found out monday in kiev the republics capital that 
the dangers of nuclear power are still very much on the minds of 
ukrainians 
in a street encounter broadcast by soviet television an elderly 
woman asked gorbachev why another nuclear power plant was being 
built in the crimea 
the area contains some of the countrys most popular beach 
resorts and is home to 2 million people 
gorbachev said he was aware of worries about the plants safety 
he also said american specialists who helped plan nuclear power 
plants in earthquakeprone japan had been asked to study the crimean 
facility 
construction is under way gorbachev said but if the 
conclusion of the specialists is that it is not advisable to build 
a station there then it will be turned into a training center for 
personnel not an atomic power station 
he assured the woman that the government now takes a cautious 
approach to nuclear power 
radio moscow said today that gorbachev was preparing visits to 
chernobyl and slavutich a nearby town built to house plant workers 
the broadcast did not say exactly when gorbachev would be at 
chernobyl where an explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor on april 
26 1986 killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud 
around the world 
gorbachev today arrived in lvov a center of railway engineering 
automobile assembly and oil refining the city of 753000 residents 
is about 260 miles west of kiev where gorbachev began his trip 
monday 
last month 10 soviet scientists wrote a letter to the communist 
party newspaper pravda calling for construction of the crimean plant 
to be stopped they said it was not designed to withstand 
earthquakes of the magnitude possible there 
since the chernobyl accident the soviets have moved away from 
complete faith in the safety of nuclear power and public opposition 
to it has grown 
nikolai lukonin the nuclear power minister announced in 
december that six projects to build nuclear plants or add more 
reactors at existing stations had been scrapped because of 
earthquake danger or tougher standards 
the soviet press is also increasingly reporting on the growing 
health problems from chernobyl last week moscow news said cancer 
cases have doubled and calves are often born without heads and limbs 
in a region 30 miles from chernobyl where people were not evacuated 
during the disaster 
also at mondays street encounter in kiev gorbachev said the 
confusing electoral system he ushered into law in december already 
needs reform 
we will review the results of the campaign carry out the 
necessary corrrections gorbachev said he was not specific 
the new law creates a 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
a twothirds of whose members will be elected by the public on march 
26 
onethird of the deputies however will be chosen by the 
communist party its affiliates unions social and political 
organizations

the attorney for the mother of a boy who died 
during an asthma attack says emergency dispatcher tapes prove 
paramedics were not attacked before they refused to enter a housing 
project to help the child 
however the speech pathologist who prepared a transcript of the 
tapes found a key segment was unintelligible and neither supported 
nor contradicted the paramedics contention that they were driven 
away by a barrage of eggs and rocks 
the 9yearold boys mother sharon jarnagin has said there was 
no such attack on the ambulance on dec 12 when her son carl was 
stricken 
her attorney david kremin contends that the tape recordings 
which were released publicly at a news conference monday refute the 
fire department paramedics version which has been supported by 
city officials 
on the recording neither paramedic says anything about being the 
target of missiles kremin said 
the fire department which oversees emergency medical activities 
is still vigorously defending the paramedics and their actions 
spokesman scott lagreca said after the tapes and transcripts were 
released 
it was a sad sad case but we feel our people were correct in 
their actions and our policy is sound 
he declined to comment further citing the 60 million lawsuit 
filed by mrs jarnagin against the department and the city 
harry dubnick an attorney for the city said kremin was wrong 
theres no doubt in my mind they did the proper thing he 
said of the paramedics 
but kremin said more than a dozen witnesses will swear that 
nothing was thrown at the rescue workers 
the recordings cover about 32 minutes of telephone and radio 
conversations among the two paramedics the ambulance dispatcher 
the police department and the boys relatives who made eight calls 
to an emergency number dec 12 
according to the transcript northwestern university speech 
pathologist thomas d carrell prepared from recordings kremin said 
he had obtained from city authorities ms jarnagin initially called 
at 414 pm 
she requested an ambulance at the dearborn homes housing project 
on the south side saying her son was having a severe asthma attack 
and losing consciousness 
about five minutes later an ambulance was dispatched followed 
by a police squad car the tapes show 
at 428 pm one of the paramedics radioed the dispatcher that 
they were leaving the housing project 
in carrells transcript the exchange goes 
ambulance uh we had a unintelligible were leaving the scene 
dispatcher ill get the police in there 
ambulance no were not hanging around were leaving the scene

a small earthquake rattled suburbs south of here 
but there were no reports of damages or injuries authorities said 
the quake at 1048 pm monday was centered about 20 miles 
southwest of seattle and registered 30 on the richter scale 
according to the national earthquake information center at golden 
colo 
the qauke was felt in federal way renton enumclaw and skyway 
the center said 
state patrol offices in bellevue and tacoma however said they 
received no phone calls from residents living in the area 
the last quake in the puget sound area occurred last tuesday and 
was centered near mount vernon about 60 miles north of seattle it 
measured 40 on the richter scale and also caused no damage or 
injuries 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 75 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the scale can cause slight damage

emperor hirohito will be laid to rest friday in an 
elaborate ceremony modeled on shinto rituals chosen by few modern 
japanese when departing this world 
only 7 percent of all japanese are mourned with the rituals of 
japans ancient indigenous shinto beliefs 90 percent are remembered 
with buddhist ceremonies and another 3 percent with christian 
services says kiyoshi yokoyama an official of the all japan 
funeral directors cooperative 
buddhism brought to japan from china about 1300 years ago has 
been the predominant religion in japan for centuries coexisting 
with shinto folk beliefs from 1600 to 1867 families were required 
to be registered at buddhist temples and priests became responsible 
for funeral rites 
even the imperial family who are believed to be descended from 
shinto gods long observed buddhist memorial services until the 
government established shinto as a state religion in 1868 
traditionally japanese place the ashes of the deceased in stone 
family tombs similar to those used in western christian cemeteries 
but attitudes toward the dead differ greatly from those in the west 
according to shinto and buddhist beliefs failure to provide 
proper funeral rites will deny the dead their final rest spirits 
that are not properly cared for will return to haunt the living it 
is believed 
a death in a japanese family is usually announced with a notice 
in black and white on the door a mortuary is summoned to prepare a 
wake which is usually held in a temple or in the home 
a white reception tent is often erected and blackandwhite 
funeral wreaths on tall poles surround the home a black suit and 
tie and for women a black kimono or dress with white pearls is the 
customary attire 
unlike hirohito whose body was sealed in a coffin after his 
death jan 7 most japanese are cremated before burial the custom 
of embalming does not exist in japan and cremation is believed to 
purify the soul 
tokyo and most other cities require that bodies be cremated due 
to a lack of space for gravesites an urn containing the cremated 
remains is placed in the family grave 
the tradition of giving koden or incense money to a bereaved 
family persists because funerals are costly ranging from about 
1600 for simple services held at home to about 60000 for a 
deluxe funeral in a temple 
for seven weeks after death the spirit is believed to hover 
nearby if proper rites are observed over the years it eventually 
goes to a buddhist afterworld or joins the pantheon of ancestral 
shinto gods the japanese believe influence the living 
reverence for the dead or ancestor worship is a way of life in 
japan that could perhaps be described as a way of keeping in touch 
with departed family members 
as in many asian cultures family members especially eldest 
sons are expected to care for the souls of their dearly departed 
with memorial services at specified intervals and with offerings of 
food incense and prayers at gravesites and at altars in their homes 
some traditional homes have two family altars a kamidana or 
godshelf for shinto gods and a butsudan or buddhist altar 
housing small tablets bearing the names of ancestors 
once a year in july or august japanese return to their home 
villages where most family graves are located and invite the 
spirits of their ancestors to spend the obon festival with them 
graves are swept and sprinkled with water in a ritual of 
purification 
the festival is a time for family reunions and community dances 
that originated as a way of entertaining and pleasing ancestral gods

the government freed 50 more 
detainees today after hunger strikes were halted at two prisons but 
scores of detainees continued to fast elsewhere and police said 20 
were hospitalized 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament he had signed 
release warrants for 50 detainees he did not say how many took part 
in hunger strikes to demand they be freed or brought to court 
about 225 detainees still are refusing food at prisons in the 
southern cities of durban pietermaritzburg and east london their 
lawyers said 
police reported 20 hunger strikers in east london were 
hospitalized monday four days after they and six fellow detainees 
began fasting 
civil rights lawyers said about 200 detainees in durban and 
pietermaritzburg have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks 
vlok has agreed to meet lawyers for the detainees but no date has 
been set 
the first wave of hunger strikes started jan 23 and involved 
nearly 300 detainees held without charge in port elizabeth and at 
diepkloof prison outside johannesburg some detainees at those 
prisons went three weeks without food then broke their fast after 
vlok promised to review their cases and release a substantial 
number 
eight detainees were freed friday 
vlok has won widepsread praise even from antigovernment 
leaders for agreeing to meet with lawyers parents and clergymen 
representing the hunger strikers he told parliament he would 
continue these discussions and i trust the entire hunger strike 
will soon be something of the past 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches on monday visited a johannesburg hospital where 
some diepkloof hunger strikers are recovering he said it was 
possible the fast would resume if the detainees were dissatisfied 
about the numbers released in the next two weeks 
many of the hunger strikers have been held more than two years 
under the 32monthold national state of emergency police can 
arrest anyone they believe may be a danger to the public safety 
vlok decides periodically based on police reports whether the 
detainee should remain incarcerated detainees do not have to be 
brought to court and charged and they can be kept in custody for as 
long as the government pleases 
monitoring groups say more than 30000 people mostly blacks 
have been detained during the state of emergency vlok has never 
given a total figure but he said two weeks ago that there were 
fewer than 1000 people in detention at that time

1984 bhopal gas disaster poured into the capital by train today to 
protest a supreme court order settling their case 
a spokesman said they made the 16hour journey from bhopal to 
seek justice and relief for the worlds worst industrial disaster 
which has killed at least 3403 people by government count 
more than 20000 people are listed as seriously affected by the 
leak of methyl isocyanate and deaths attributed to it continue at 
the rate of at least one a day more than 500000 damage claims have 
been filed 
the protesters from bhopal today blocked the road to the supreme 
court demanding a reversal of the feb 14 order that instructed the 
union carbide corp to pay 470 million as full and final settlement 
of all claims arising from the leak 
the government had sued for 3 billion from the danbury 
connbased company whose indian subisidiary owned the plant 
some of the demonstrators had not eaten since the train journey 
began monday afternoon at least five protesters were admitted to 
hospitals today suffering from shortness of breath and exhaustion 
said vc shukla a member of parliament from the opposition jan 
morcha national front party 
many more in the crowd looked ready to collapse and talked 
between gasps for breath they complained they had no water to drink 
since arriving in new delhi 
placards depicted prime minister rajiv gandhi on his knees before 
a devil throwing a coin they proclaimed slave india salutes 
killer carbide 
riaz ahmed qureishi who lost two children in the gas leak said 
the protesters did not accept the award and demanded the hanging of 
former union carbide chariman warren anderson 
killers of one prime minister are hanged but killers of 
thousands of people escape with only a small payment he said 
referring to the jan 6 hangings of two sikhs convicted in the 1984 
assassination of prime minister indira gandhi 
the government is working on how to divide the award among those 
who have claimed damages

for bhopal gas victims group said she did not know the amount but 
it was very little 
my husband is very ill in hospital my sister died and my

we have been betrayed by the court said shukla a former 
chief minister of madhya pradesh state where bhopal is located 
he said the protesters will march to parliament on wednesday and 
would ask the supreme court to review the verdict 
we are outraged that the government should have agreed to the 
order without consulting even the relief agencies shukla the 
opposition legislator said after losing four years what was the 
sudden hurry to settle for so little 
parliament opened a 3monthlong session today and president 
ramaswamy venkataraman made no mention of the union carbide

starting today santa monica residents 
can fire off a complaint to city hall look for a job or check to 
see if the latest best seller is at the library all by tapping a 
few computer keys 
touting itself as the city of the future santa monica was to go 
on line with a computer system that will allow residents with 
personal computers a direct hookup with city hall 
officials say they will answer each computerized missive with a 
reply sent to that persons own computer 
but residents can use the system to do more than complain about 
municipal problems they can comb the computer network to find out 
such things as where to get parking permits and dog licenses what 
events are scheduled at the pier and the santa monica civic 
auditorium which city agencies are hiring and whether or not the 
books they want to pick up at the local library have already been 
checked out 
eventually the system will be used to apply for licenses and 
permits said assistant city manager lynne c barrette 
the idea is the brainchild of community activist michael hill 
this is a marvelous way to access the city staff reports 
said hill who suggested the computer network two years ago you 
can play a truly effective role people who feel disenfranchised can 
find a way to be a part of government 
not all reaction to the system has been positive however 
some officials fear the computer system will give this seaside 
community an an image as an elitist city catering to affluent 
personal computer owners they hope to overcome that by setting up 
computer terminals at the library and other public centers to give 
everyone access 
computer experts expressed concern that neither the public nor 
bureaucrats may be ready for such an innovation 
it may overburden ambivalent department heads and city 
employees who want to be responsive but arent getting additional 
resources said judith payne a social scientist at santa monicas 
rand corp think tank 
the cost of setting up the system has been nil however the 
350000 system called public electronic network was a gift from 
two computer companies hewlett packard provided the hardware and 
metasystems inc donated the software programs 
the system is designed to work with any model personal computer 
there is no charge to use the network although frequent users will 
see their phone bills increasing officials said

after weeks of amorous but clumsy courting a 
female california condor laid an egg scientists hope will prove 
fertile and produce a condor chick for the endangered species 
captive breeding program 
the egg was noticed monday after los angeles zoo researchers 
reviewed a videotape of activity in the condors plywood nest box 
and briefly saw it as the condors traded places from the nest to the 
outside 
the couple a male condor named cuyama and a female named 
cachuma had piqued the interest of observers on sunday when they 
showed signs indicating an egglaying was near 
they were showing great interest in each other nibbling each 
other and following each other around to the nest box and scraping 
around as though making a nest in the sand said mike wallace 
curator of birds at the zoo and supervisor of its captive condor 
breeding program 
he said the egg was the first for the los angeles zoo program a 
condor egg laid in captivity was hatched last year in the program at 
the san diego wild animal park 
only 28 of the endangered california condors remain alive 14 in 
captivity at the los angeles zoo and 14 more in san diego 
scientists hope the vultures which are north americas largest land 
birds with 9foot wingspans will reproduce enough so that some can 
be returned to the wild in five to 10 years 
the breeding program has removed all known california condors 
from the wild environmentalists have complained that other captive 
breeding programs have met with only limited success 
the egg will be removed from the nest and placed in incubation 
sometime wednesday wallace said as part of the breeding program 
scientists hope to have the birds produce as many as three 
fertilized eggs during the january to april mating season 
if you remove the first egg as soon as its laid they will 
recycle and go into another mating ritual and within 30 days lay 
another egg he explained 
experts will know in seven to 10 days whether the egg placed in 
the incubator is fertilized wallace said if it is the chick 
should hatch in 55 to 66 days 
cuyama and cachuma both 6 years old and new to the courting 
ritual have shown an interest in each other for the past few weeks 
with cuyama waltzing around cachuma with outstretched wings wallace 
said 
we had seen attempts on cuyamas part to copulate but they 
were not good ones because its his first time and hes learning 
how wallace said 
the other six condor couples at the zoo also have been in 
courtship over the past week

an illinois judge ruled that the widow of writer 
john cheever has done her part to settle a contract dispute with an 
independent publishing house over a collection of her husbands 
stories 
the order from cook county circuit judge roger j kiley jr says 
mary cheever fulfilled her obligation to academy chicago publishers 
by providing it 15 uncollected stories of her choosing the new york 
times reported today 
the publisher had planned a volume of 68 stories but was stopped 
from bringing it out last year when mrs cheever sued contending 
the august 1987 contract was invalid because promises to her of 
consultation and control over the books content had not been kept 
last september kiley ruled that the contract was valid he also 
proposed a compromise under which mrs cheever would submit 12 to 15 
of the 68 stories last week he ruled that the stories she 
submitted fulfilled that obligation 
thomas leavens a lawyer for the publishers said academy chicago 
had not decided whether to appeal 
mrs cheevers lawyer martin garbus said she was now free to 
edit her husbands stories in a collection of her own 
cheever who was awarded the pulitzer prize for fiction in 1979 
died in 1983

defense minister abdelmagid khalil has 
resigned charging the governments reluctance to negotiate an end 
to sudans southern civil war has isolated the country two 
newspapers reported today 
the independent newspaper alayam said khalil quit after 
returning from an unannounced visit to jordan and iraq where he 
apparently was refused new military and financial aid 
aladwa another independent newspaper said khalils letter of 
resignation charged the foreign policy adopted by the government 
does not lead to a unified internal front nor to stability and has 
also led to the isolation of the country both in the arab and 
outside world 
the newspapers quoted information minister beshir omar as saying 
prime minister sadek mahdi has accepted khalils resignation he did 
not name a successor alayam speculated that mahdi will assume the 
defense portfolio he held from the time he was elected prime 
minister in 1986 to june 1988 when he appointed khalil 
mahdi canceled a trip to japan to attend the funeral of emperor 
hirohito because of the emergency circumstances according to 
omars statement vice president idris banna and the fivemember 
supreme council will represent him at the funeral the statement 
said 
khalils letter said government policies have weakened the 
countrys ability to acquire military and economic assistance 
the governments rejection of the peace plan and its reluctance 
to move in the direction of peace in the country has affected 
sudans reputation in the outside world 
the united states this month urged an end to the almost 
6yearold civil war and said it would try to promote a peace 
settlement washington has linked further us aid to ending the 
war and other friendly western and arab donors say there is an 
urgent need to end the fighting 
john garang the useducated renegade colonel who leads the 
sudan peoples liberation army signed a peace plan nov 16 with 
mohammed osman mirghani leader of sudans democratic unionist 
party at the time the democratic unionists belonged to the 
governing coalition of mahdis umma party and the national islamic 
front of moslem fundamentalist hassan turabi 
although his party endorsed the plan mahdi refused to let the 
government act on it in december the unionists left the coalition 
because of the governments position on the peace plan and its 
handling of the economy mahdi formed a new government in february 
with the national islamic front as the junior partner 
the front rejects a key rebel demand abolition of harsh islamic 
laws that are applied to all sudanese regardless of religion 
sudan is divided into the minority christians and animists of the 
south a black people and the dominant moslems of the north who 
are arabic

the supreme court today agreed to referee a 
dispute between the us government and american businesses stemming 
from the 1981 settlement of the iran hostage crisis 
the court said it will review a ruling that businesses recovering 
money from irans government do not have to pay a portion of it to 
the us government 
the financial deal that freed the 52 american hostages from iran 
included release by the us government of billions of dollars in 
frozen iranian assets the settlement also set up a process 
permitting those with claims against iran to take them to an 
international tribunal 
the supreme court in 1981 upheld the power of former president 
jimmy carter to approve the settlement 
that question was not at issue in the case acted on today in 
which sperry corp and sperry world trade inc made a claim against 
iran 
the companies leased computer systems to iran during the 1970s 
before the hostage crisis severed relations between the united 
states and iran 
after the hostages were freed in january 1981 the sperry 
corporations were awarded 28 million by the international tribunal 
set up to handle claims against iran 
congress in 1985 passed a law requiring those who win such claims 
to pay to the federal government 15 percent of the first 5 million 
recovered and 1 percent of amounts over that 
the fee is to reimburse governmental expenses in helping resolve 
the claims 
the government said the sperry corporations owed it 42000 
a federal appeals court here ruled last august that the fee is an 
unconstitutional seizure of private property by the government 
whatever the fee was thought to be it was a taking of 
sperrys money to help settle the national crisis a burden the 
government must bear on behalf of all of us the appeals court 
said 
justice department lawyers in seeking supreme court review said 
tens of millions of dollars are at stake some 127 million already 
has been deducted by the government from awards to successful 
claimants 
the governments appeal said it is reasonable to require those 
that win claims against iran to defray the 4 million the us 
government spends each year to help operate the iran claims process 
the case is us vs sperry corp 88952

the supreme court today allowed kentucky to 
begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law requiring parental notification 
the justices without comment turned down an emergency request 
by prochoice advocates seeking to block the law until a federal 
appeals court rules on its constitutionality 
at issue was the laws provisions for parental notification and 
consent 
as passed by the state legislature the law required that 
unmarried girls under 18 seeking abortions first obtain the written 
informed consent of both parents 
the law challenged quickly by the american civil liberties 
union never has taken effect 
but us district judge charles m allen in louisville last aug 
23 ruled that the law with certain modifications could be enforced 
allen previously had struck down the mandatory twoparent 
requirement a separate provision requiring that parental consent 
forms be notarized and the imposition of criminal liability on any 
doctor who does not get the consent of both parents if both are 
available 
allen said those provisions impermissibly interfere with a girls 
constitutional right to have an abortion 
but in his ruling last august allen said the state could require 
that girls living with both parents get their informed consent or 
as an alternative get permission from a judge before obtaining an 
abortion 
if the girl lives with only one parent or legal guardian allen 
said she only needs the consent of that person 
allens ruling is being challenged before the 6th us circuit 
court of appeals but the appeals court refused to block enforcement 
of the abortion regulations pending its review 
in seeking emergency help aclu lawyers said allens decision 
inappropriately rewrote the kentucky law to make it pass 
constitutional muster 
they said numerous affidavits from doctors and other health 
providers introduced as evidence in the kentucky case have 
demonstrated the burdensomeness of the informed parent consent 
requirement and the attendant increase in cost and medical risk to 
the minor through delay 
the laws opponents say informed consent means that parents 
likely would have to visit a hospital or abortion clinic before 
approving of the procedure 
the emergency request said the law would lead some young girls 
to delay or avoid seeking professional help and medical care 
when they believe they are pregnant 
it said enforcement of the kentucky law should be blocked because 
two similar cases one from ohio and one from minnesota currently 
are pending before the supreme court 
the justices have not yet said whether they will grant review to 
the ohio and minnesota controversies 
in each of those cases the disputed abortion laws are not in 
effect 
the case is eubanks vs wilkinson a582

the supreme court today voted to resolve a 
significant dispute over the freedom of information act while 
agreeing to keep the identities of the legal combatants a secret 
the justices said they will decide whether a government law 
enforcement agency must surrender to a government contractor being 
investigated for possible fraud certain documents received from 
another agency 
much of the case is cloaked in secrecy including the identity 
of the contractor and the government agencies involved presumably 
to protect the contractors reputation 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals based in new york city 
ruled last june 23 that the soughtafter government documents must 
be released to the contractor but supreme court justice thurgood 
marshall on jan 30 blocked any such release until the high court 
considered the governments appeal 
the documents at issue are 1978 letters a government agency 
referred to in court papers as the john doe agency exchanged with 
the contractor identified as john doe corp about the contractors 
billing practices 
those letters became relevant in 1986 during a grand jury 
investigation of possible fraudulent practices by the contractor 
and they were tranferred from the john doe agency to a federal law 
enforcement agency identified in court papers as john doe 
government agency 
the contractor under investigation filed an foia lawsuit in 1987 
seeking all documents that are related in any way to the subject 
matter of the 1978 correspondence 
a federal trial judge ruled against the contractor saying 
release of the documents would jeopardize the grand jury 
investigation 
but the 2nd circuit court ruled that the foia requires surrender 
of the documents 
an exemption in the law for materials compiled for law 
enforcement purposes does not apply in this case the appeals 
court said because the letters were not originally obtained or 
generated for law enforcement purposes 
in the appeal acted on today justice department lawyers argued 
that the june ruling would seriously impair the ability of 
numerous federal agencies to conduct their law enforcement 
responsibilities and hinder an important law enforcement 
investigation 
the case is john doe agency vs john doe corp 881083

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether los angeles must pay damages to a taxi company that went out 
of business after the city intervened in a dispute between the 
company and its drivers 
the court will review a ruling that barred golden state transit 
corp from winning any money from the city 
the los angeles city council refused in 1981 to renew golden 
states taxi franchise because the cab company was snarled in a 
labor dispute with a teamsters union local that represented its 
drivers 
golden state with 400 cabs had been the citys largest taxi 
operator until 1980 the teamsters called a strike for the same day 
the city was to consider renewing the franchises of 13 cab companies 
golden state went out of business after failing to win renewal of 
its franchise 
the supreme court in 1986 ruled that los angeles officials 
improperly interfered in violation of the national labor relations 
act 
the justices said then that local governments lack authority to 
tip the balance in labor disputes by defining what economic 
sanctions either side might suffer 
but the high court ruling left it unclear what remedy was 
available to golden state 
the case went back to the lower federal courts and last 
september the 9th us circuit court of appeals denied compensatory 
damages to the defunct taxi company 
the appeals court noted that a federal judge following the 
supreme court ruling in 1986 ordered los angeles to grant golden 
state a fouryear franchise and pay the market value of the 
companys assets less what it received in bankruptcy proceedings 
the company said that was a hollow victory since it had 
liquidated its assets when it went out of business 
the 9th circuit court said golden state was not entitled to 
compensatory damages under a federal civil rights law generally 
invoked by individuals rather than businesses 
the appeals court said the civil rights law does not provide 
monetary damages in such cases for violations of the national labor 
relations act 
the appeals court also rejected the taxi companys argument that 
the federal courts have inherent power to award damages in such 
cases 
the case is golden state transit vs los angeles 88840

the supreme court today threw out an emergency 
request by antiabortion activists who had sought to prevent a long 
island ny man from having an abortion performed on his comatose 
wife 
the abortion was performed earlier this month after state courts 
and supreme court justice thurgood marshall rejected the request 
in a highly unusual move the antiabortion activists persisted 
in seeking supreme court action even after the case was made moot by 
the abortion they sought help from supreme court justice antonin 
scalia who referred it to the full court 
john short and john broderick of the long island righttolife 
group had challenged rulings that appointed martin klein of upper 
brookville as legal guardian of his wife nancy 
that designation allowed him to order the abortion 
mrs klein 32 fell into a coma after suffering brain damage in 
a car accident dec 13 she was about 18 weeks pregnant when the 
abortion was performed 
her husband had been told by doctors that mrs klein would have a 
better chance of survivla if the fetus she was carrying was aborted

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether people who do not own property may be excluded from 
membership on a public body authorized to recommend a reorganization 
of local government in the st louis area 
the court said it will hear a challenge to the makeup of the st 
louis cityst louis county board of freeholders 
the board of freeholders was created to write a proposed charter 
for reorganizing the city and county government structure the board 
also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the city and 
county governments 
any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a 
referendum 
board members were ppointed by the mayor of st louis the county 
executive and the governor of missouri 
state representative robert j quinn a st louis county resident 
who does not own property said his rights were violated by a state 
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder 
board to property owners 
quinn suing for himself and all others in the city and county 
who do not own property said the exclusion violated the us 
constitutions guarantee of equal protection under law 
but the missouri supreme court ruled last september that the 
federal constitutional protection does not apply because the 
freeholder board does not have general governmental powers 
the board of freeholders serves only to recommend a plan of 
reorganization to the voters of st louis city and st louis 
county the state court said it can recommend property 
taxes and sales taxes but it cannot levy and collect them in sum 
the board of freeholders has no general governmental powers 
the state court said the st louis case is not covered by past 
us supreme court rulings that struck down property ownership as a 
qualification for membership on a city school board or regional 
airport commission

the supreme court let stand rulings that the 
public has no right to attend the socalled summary jury trials 
held in some legal disputes 
the justices without comment rejected arguments by newspapers 
in three ohio cities that trial judges should be barred from 
conducting such proceedings in secret 
the newspapers lawyers had asked the high court to rule for the 
first time that the constitution provides a public right of access 
to judicial proceedings in civil or noncriminal cases 
the court in 1980 ruled that the public has a right to attend 
criminal trials even when defendants object the justices since have 
expanded that ruling to cover jury selection and pretrial 
proceedings in criminal cases 
but the court never has ruled that such a right of access exists 
as well for civil trials and proceedings 
the appeal acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit by three ohio 
utilities against general electric co over the design and 
construction of the william h zimmer nuclear power plant 
the suit alleged that ge sold the utilties dayton power and 
light columbus and southern electric and cincinnati gas and 
electric co a nuclear reactor container system it knew was 
incapable of operating in a safe manner 
us district judge s arthur spiegel presided over a summary 
jury trial in the case in which lawyers for both sides presented 
summaries of their evidence 
the jurys verdict in such proceedings is advisory and 
nonbinding unless both sides agree otherwise the verdict is 
supposed to be a reliable indicator of a full trials outcome 
sparking attempts to settle so a full trial will not be necessary 
since first introduced in 1980 summary jury trials have been 
used in at least 65 federal courts in about half the states 
in the ge case the judge ruled that the summary trial would be 
closed to the public and ordered the parties lawyers and jurors 
never to reveal anything that occurred during the proceeding he 
also permanently sealed the trial transcript 
the cincinnati post the dayton daily news and the columbus 
dispatch challenged the closure but the 6th us circuit court of 
appeals ruled against them last aug 18 
the appeals court said summary jury trials are more akin to 
settlement conferences than real trials and that the public 
therefore has no right to attend or see the transcript 
there is no historically recognized of right to summary jury 
trials in that this mechanism has been in existence for less than a 
decade the appeals court said adding there is general 
agreement that historically settlement techniques are closed 
procedures 
in seeking supreme court review lawyers for the three newspapers 
argued public confidence will be lost if judges may respond to 
their expanding dockets by disposing of cases through secret 
courtroom proceedings and permanent gag orders 
this court cannot expect that public confidence so vital to an 
effective judiciary will thrive where judges conduct decisive 
courtroom proceedings behind closed doors in permanent 
courtimposed secrecy the appeal contended 
but lawyers for ge discounted what they called the appeals 
great flourishes of hyperbole and urged the justices to reject 
it 
the case is cincinnati post vs ge 88813

the supreme court today refused to let states 
and state agencies be sued for alleged violations of federal 
copyright law 
the court without comment turned away a radford va case that 
highlighted a conflict between the constitutions 11th amendment 
shielding states from federal lawsuits and copyright law requiring 
all suits be filed in federal court 
photographer richard anderson sued radford university a 
staterun school and some school officials over the unauthorized 
use in 1982 of copyright photographs 
a federal trial judge dismissed the school and its officials as 
defendants ruling that the 11th amendment protects them against 
such suits 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal by a 
21 vote last july 20 
the appeals court noted a 1985 supreme court decision that 
congress may abrogate the states constitutionally secured 
immunity from suit in federal court only making its intention 
unmistakably clear in the language of the statute 
congress did not do so in passing the copyright act of 1976 the 
appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for anderson argued that 
the 4th circuit court misinterpreted the 1976 copyright law they 
said the law was intended to make states generally accountable for 
copyright violations 
because the jurisdiction of the federal courts is exclusive in 
copyright cases the effect of the 11th amendment defense is not 
simply to relegate the injured party to a suit in state court but to 
deny any damage recovery at all against state infringers the 
appeal said 
the association of american publishers the association of 
american university presses and the american intellectual property 
law association sided with anderson in friend of the court 
briefs 
whenever the 11th amendment has previously been found to 
preclude federal court jurisdiction some other forum has been 
available one of those briefs told the justices for anderson 
and all others holding copyrights however no relief can be sought 
in state courts 
the case is anderson photography vs radford university 88651

a us navy captain said 
today he would have rescued vietnamese boat people his ship found in 
the south china sea if he had been correctly informed of their 
desperate plight 
capt alexander balian 48 of los angeles accused critics of 
unfairly judging him in hindsight 
he has been before a navy courtmartial since feb 10 on charges 
of failing to adequately assist the more than 80 vietnamese refugees 
his ship the uss dubuque encountered june 9 as it sailed for the 
persian gulf 
thirtyone of the refugees died and survivors resorted to 
cannibalism before they were rescued by filipino fishermen june 27 
after 37 days at sea united nations officials said 
balian his voice choking with emotion said if he had known the 
desperate conditions aboard the vietnamese craft there is no 
doubt in my mind i would tow them to my side and embark them thats 
what i did on two previous occasions 
he said he ordered his executive officer lt cmdr stanley 
halter to determine if the refugee boat was seaworthy 
finally the report came back no engine and i surmised they 
had a good sail balian said 
he also said he was told they could make it on their own if we 
gave them food and water which were provided 
under crossexamination balian insisted he was not responsible 
for the refugees resorting to cannibalism 
i am being charged with giving insufficient assistance he 
said what is sufficient assistance youre saying i should have 
embarked them i should have embarked them on hindsight 
during the afternoon session trial judge capt james freyer 
rejected a prosecution attempt to offer as evidence a fitness report 
on balian 
freyer said out of the jurys presence that the report was 
highly prejudicial and implied balian was guilty 
balian was relieved of command of the dubuque in august after the 
vietnamese reported the incident to un officials in the 
philippines 
he was acquitted thursday of a charge of failing to assist a 
vietnamese who drowned 
balian today denied allegations that he ordered crew members not 
to throw life rings to some of the vietnamese who swam toward the 
ship he said he did order an interpreter to tell swimmers to move 
away for fear they would be injured by the ships propellers 
he also denied previous testimony by a crew member chief petty 
officer luis ilano that he had advised the vietnamese simply to 
follow the sun to reach land 
balian said he ordered the interpreter to give the refugees a 
navigational chart and mark their position

the supreme court today allowed the food and 
drug administration to impose strict controls on the use of drugs by 
veterinarians for experimental treatment of some animal diseases 
the court without comment rejected arguments by an illinois 
drug distributing company that the government wrongly is interfering 
with the treatment of serious animal illnesses 
the fda seized a large quantity of drugs july 9 1986 from 
schuyler laboratories inc in rushville ill 
the drugs are in bulk form veterinarians mix them with other 
drugs to create new medications to treat certain diseases for which 
the fda has not approved finished drugs 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals which upheld the fda 
seizure last july said the federal agency had looked the other 
way for decades in declining to enforce rules against the 
veterinarians 
but the appeals court said the fda reacted to the growing 
practice of mixing experimental drugs by deciding to cut off 
supplies 
schuyler laboratories acts as a middleman purchasing the 
unblended drugs from the manufacturer and selling them to 
veterinarians 
schuyler was accused of violating fda regulations that require 
drug labels to carry directions for their use the bulk drugs do not 
carry directions 
the company said preventing veterinarians from mixing their own 
drugs could have devastating consequences for the animals that 
provide the basics of the american food supply 
schuyler said there are no fdaapproved drugs to treat acute 
inflammations respiratory infections and other diseases that can 
wipe out dairy herds and other cattle 
but the federal agency defended its cautious approach to 
licensing new drugs for treating animals it can take years of 
testing to determine for example whether new animal drugs can 
cause cancer in humans who consume the animal products federal 
officials said 
the 7th circuit court while noting that many veterinarians 
find this state of affairs deplorable said the fda is acting 
within its powers 
no individual veterinarian will possess complete knowledge of 
the efficacy of a novel drug compound let alone of its persistence 
in the food chain the appeals court said 
schuyler laboratories failed to show that the fda policy is 
arbitrary or capricious the appeals court said 
the case is 91 kg containers vs us 88614

television evangelist jimmy swaggart failed 
today in his supreme court bid to kill a 90 million lawsuit by a 
defrocked evangelist who swaggart accused of adultery in 1986 
the court without comment rejected arguments that marvin 
gormans suit against swaggart and others unconstitutionally 
entangles louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine and 
discipline 
gorman was a pastor of the first assembly of god church in new 
orleans when swaggart accused him of immoral dalliances with 
several women 
gorman resigned from his ministry a day after a july 1986 meeting 
of church leaders in which swaggart aired his allegations and gorman 
admitted to one instance of immoral conduct 
swaggart and other assembly of god officials did not consider 
gormans resignation valid however and he was formally dismissed 
only after the accusations were read to his congregation 
in february 1988 swaggart himself tearfully confessed to an 
undisclosed sin a new orleans prostitute later said swaggart paid 
her to perform sex acts while he watched 
swaggart was defrocked by the assemblies of god last april 8 
after refusing to step down from the pulpit for at least a year 
he returned to his ministrys family worship center in baton 
rouge la and resumed his television programs but the fortunes of 
jimmy swaggart world ministries have not recovered fully from the 
1987 scandal 
last month penthouse magazine published an article in which a 
new orleans stripper told about performing sexual acts for swaggart 
calling her story diabolical and slanderous fiction swaggart 
has threatened to sue the magazine he also said his television 
ministry would end this month unless he received enough donations to 
overcome pornographers who are trying to sabbotage his 
broadcasts 
penthouse said the stripper catherine mary kampen detailed the 
alleged relationship with swaggart in a deposition for lawyers 
representing gorman in his lawsuit against swaggart and others 
gorman contends among other things that he was defamed and 
libeled by swaggart 
swaggart and the 13 other defendants sought to have gormans suit 
dismissed arguing that it violates religious freedoms for courts to 
preside over disputes stemming from church discipline 
the secular courts are without jurisdiction to hear his 
claim lawyers for swaggart contended 
the cases are swaggart vs adler 881080 and treeby vs gorman

the 35 fine a houston lawyer was assessed in 1986 for not buckling 
up 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal question 
refused to hear raymond d richards jrs arguments that requiring 
him to wear a seat belt while driving a motor vehicle violates his 
fundamental right to be free from bodily restraints 
texas courts also rejected richards arguments although along 
the way one judge ben g levy voted for him 
dissenting from an opinion of the court of appeals for the first 
supreme judicial district of texas levy wrote that allowing the 
state to punish someone for not wearing a seat belt might lead to 
punishment for smoking cigarettes for not brushing ones teeth or 
for being foolish 
in a recent interview richards said he had spent a lot of 
time but not a significant amount of money in contesting his 35 
fine

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
the pandering conviction of a hollywood movie producer who hired 
actors to peform sex acts in a pornographic film 
the justices without comment let stand a california supreme 
court ruling that harold freemans conviction on charges of 
procuring people for purposes of prostitution violated his freedom 
of expression 
freeman president of the hollywood video production co is in 
the business of producing and marketing adult films he produced 
and directed a 1983 film called caught from behind part ii 
for the movie freeman hired actors and actresses who as part of 
their roles engaged in various sex acts 
los angeles county prosecutors charged freeman with five counts 
of pandering based on his hiring five actresses who performed in 
the movie freeman was not charged with any violation of the states 
obscenity laws and the movie was not formally judged to be obscene 
freeman was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail amd five 
years probation he also was ordered to pay 10000 in restitution 
and a 100 fine 
the state supreme court threw out freemans conviction last aug 
25 ruling that californias pandering law should not have been 
applied to him 
freeman was not procuring people for the purpose of prostitution 
the state court said because there is no evidence he paid the 
acting fees for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification his 
own or the actors 
the state court added that even if what the films participants 
engaged in could be classified as prostitution the application of 
the pandering statute to the hiring of actors to perform in the 
production of a nonobscene motion picture would impinge 
unconstitutionally upon first amendment values 
the constitutions first amendment guarantees freedom of speech 
and expression 
on feb 1 justice sandra day oconnor turned down an emergency 
request by county prosecutors seeking to postpone the effect of the 
state supreme courts ruling until their formal appeal was 
considered 
oconnor predicted that the prosecutors formal appeal would be 
rejected because the state court ruling was based on an 
interpretation of state law and was thus binding upon this 
court 
the cases are california vs freeman 881054 and applegate vs 
freeman 881050

the supreme court today let minnesota state 
troopers claim the costs of their workday meals as tax deductions 
the justices without comment rejected government lawyers 
arguments that lower court rulings allowing the deductions invited 
innumerable claims by the millions of americans who eat meals 
while on the job 
minnesota state highway patrol troopers karl w christey and 
steven l pillsbury claimed such deductions for the tax years 1981 
and 1982 
the internal revenue service denied the claims but in a 
subsequent lawsuit seeking tax refunds a federal trial judge and the 
8th us circuit court of appeals ruled for the troopers 
christey had deducted 96266 and 88028 respectively for his 
meals while on duty pillsbury claimed 944 and 968 respectively 
for the same years both men made their claims under that part of 
the internal revenue code allowing deductions for ordinary and 
necessary business expenses 
the supreme court in 1977 ruled that new jersey state troopers 
could not claim the costs of their onduty meals as tax deductions 
but that case was decided on another portion of the tax code 
minnesota troopers are required to eat their meals in a public 
restaurant adjacent to a highway whenever practical 
they must report by radio before beginning their meals and make 
sure they supply the telephone number or code number of the 
restaurant where they are eating 
no more than two troopers may eat together and they must eat at 
certain times they may not bring meals from home 
in its ruling last march 2 the 8th circuit court acknowledged 
that the costs of someones meals most often is a personal expense 
and not taxdeductible 
but the appeals court agreed with us district judge paul 
magnuson that the number of dutyrelated restrictions and 
requirements concerning their meals effectively extended the 
performance of the troopers duties from patrol cars on highways to 
tables in restaurants 
the appeals court added this is not a case in which the 
taxpayers are attempting to deduct the cost of their meals merely 
because they are working overtime or working through their meal 
break or where business activities make meals at home 
inconvenient 
in seeking supreme court review justice department lawyers said 
the appeals court was wrong and that meal costs are personal not 
business expenses 
the troopers expended these funds because they were hungry not 
because the highway patrol required it the government appeal 
said the meals were a personal benefit to them just like the 
meals that other types of workers consume during the workday 
the appeal contended that the lower court rulings invited 
innumerable claims for their deduction depending upon the outcome 
of an undefined inquiry into the almost infinite variety of 
circumstances of each persons employment 
government lawyers said the appeals court ruling encourages 
substantial factbound litigation which will have major deleterious 
effects on tax administration 
the case is us vs christey 881023

about 7000 people returned to their 
homes today after they had been evacuated because of a stinking gas 
from a refinerys leaking crude oil tank police said 
the evacuation order was lifted at 530 am police officer al 
gillen said all the roads are reopened everything is back to 
normal as it was before the leak 
the gas which escaped monday from a leaking tank at a chevron 
refinery contained hydrogen sulfide a flammable poisonous 
chemical that smells like rotten eggs 
the leak first discovered in the afternoon was not considered a 
serious health threat but at least 24 people were examined at local 
hospitals officials said no serious injuries were reported 
an estimated 5000 to 7000 people were asked to leave their 
homes in this coastal city near the louisiana border and about 
3000 stayed in emergency shelters overnight said police sgt mark 
blanton the rest found lodging on their own 
police barricaded a 17by14block area in the western portion of 
the heavily industrial city 
weve had some real bad fires at these plants where people were 
injured and killed but even then we never had an evacuation of this 
magnitude and ive been here 28 years said police sgt cedric 
clayton 
we decided to evacuate the entire area simply as a safety 
precaution he added there are a lot of elderly people who live 
in that particular area and there are two or three public housting 
complexes 
chevron officials said they had been monitoring air quality in 
the area of the leak since early monday afternoon and described the 
gaseous release as carrying a miminum risk but a terrible odor 
most crude oils in texas have sulphur in themand that means 
their gas contains hydrogen sulfide which is listed as one of the 
hazardous chemicals said chevron spokesman art spencer 
were doing continuous monitoring and were finding that 
theres nothing there that is hazardous to health and were also 
finding that the hydrocarbon smell in the air is lessening 
spencer said but the odor got so strong that the city emergency 
response unit decided to go ahead and evacuate people downwind of 
it 
st mary hospital spokeswoman jody roberts said doctors treated 
20 people many of whom complained of headaches watery eyes or 
breathing difficulties four patients also were treated at doctors 
hospital 
a chevron employee discovered the leak around 130 pm monday 
and reported it around the same time that the first calls began 
arriving at police headquarters officials said 
spencer said the leaking tank has a capacity of about 300000 
gallons but its exact content was not known because it was 
connected to an automatic pump that fed into a refining unit 
crews were using vacuum trucks this morning to remove the spilled 
crude from a ditch surrounding the tank spencer estimated the task 
could take two or three days to complete

today 
we are having difficulty reaching the site said stovall 
the water in the area is five feet deep

the supreme court today refused to hear the 
appeal of a former ku klux klan leader in north carolina convicted 
of criminal contempt for his role in a paramilitary organization 
the court without comment rejected arguments that former klan 
leader glenn f miller was denied a fair trial 
miller was sentenced to six months in prison and placed on 
probation for three years for criminal contempt 
he also was sentenced to five years in prison in a subsequent 
case in which he pleaded guilty to illegally possessing hand 
grenades and issuing a declaration of war againsts blacks jews 
and homosexuals 
miller who testified for the government in prosecutions against 
other white supremacists was placed in the federal witness 
protection program and given a new identity 
the case acted on today stems from a 1984 lawsuit filed by bobby 
l person accusing miller and the carolina knights of the ku klux 
klan with violently intimidating blacks to prevent them from 
exercising their rights 
a court consent decree that settled the suit in 1985 barred 
miller and the klan from operating a paramilitary organization or 
engaging in military exercises or training in furtherance of a 
civil disorder 
about a year later miller was accused of criminal contempt for 
violating the consent decree the klan organization meanwhile had 
changed its name to the white patriot party 
morris dees of the southern poverty law center which represented 
person filed the criminal contempt complaint and in an unusual 
development acted as prosecutor in the contempt proceeding for 
about two months 
in june 1986 the us attorneys office in north carolina was 
placed in charge of the case dees was allowed to continue as an 
assistant to the us attorneys office in prosecuting the complaint 
miller was convicted of criminal contempt after a jury heard 
testimony that his ultimate goal was the armed overthrow of the 
government 
miller said his rights were violated for a number of reasons he 
argued that dees continued to be in charge of the prosecution after 
june 1986 and was biased against him 
miller also said all blacks should have been barred as 
prospective jurors because they stood to benefit from the court 
order miller was charged with violating 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld his conviction last 
august 
the appeals court said there was adequate evidence that the us 
attorneys office and not dees was in control of the case 
the appeals court also said miller failed to show that no black 
could serve as an impartial juror in a case involving a white 
supremacist 
the case is miller vs person 88792

playwright vaclav havel today was 
convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a 
rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion 
havel czecholovakias bestknown dissident was charged with 
inciting people to participate in the banned jan 16 rally and for 
obstructing the duty of a public official 
on the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term 
of two years on the second to another six months in prison havel 
was found guilty of both offenses in a oneday trial 
the prosecution of havel and other opposition activists has gone 
on despite widespread criticism at home in the east bloc and the 
west that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with 
dissent seven other activists from the charter 77 human rights 
committee and other independent movements also went on trial today 
authorities banned a number of western diplomats and 
representatives from human rights organizations from the trials 
havel 52 who helped found the charter 77 movement has been 
harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his 
1975 open letter to communist party leader gustav husak accused 
authorities of creating a bureaucratic order of grey monotony that 
stifles all individuality 
havel was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in 
jail in 1979 authorities have banned his plays which are widely 
acclaimed in productions abroad 
earlier today more than 100 havel sympathizers had jammed a 
small stairwell leading to the courtroom loudly cheering him police 
led him to the trial 
havels brother ivan said havel did not take part in a jan 16 
flowerlaying ceremony in a downtown prague square but was detained 
on the square an hour later 
the seven other defendants all activists with charter 77 and 
other independent groups face hooliganism charges in connection 
with the jan 16 gathering the charges carry a maximum twoyear 
jail sentence 
the seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of 
jan palach the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier 
to protest the sovietled invasion that quashed communist reforms in 
czechoslovakia 
the arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest 
in prague since palachs death 
ota veverka one of the seven charter 77 human rights group 
activists being tried said what happened on wenceslas square was 
not a criminal act but an assault by police 
most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to 
lay flowers in palachs memory and no demonstration was planned 
more than 2000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for 
the government to release the dissidents 
it was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment 
intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public 
the trials also have drawn an official protest from the hungarian 
writers union as well as criticism from the united states britain 
and other western governments and groups 
last month nato warsaw pact and 12 other european nations 
agreed on new human rights accords in vienna 
britain and the united states have charged that the trials 
violate the spirit of those accords nine independent groups in 
czechoslovakia have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new 
accords to protest the trials 
those on trial are charter 77 activists sasha vondra and jana 
sternova and independent activists veverka nemec jana petrova 
stanislav penc and petr placak

camouflaged combat fatigues replaced pastel 
nursing uniforms at the staterun general hospital where the rhode 
island national guard was called in to replace striking workers for 
the second time this year 
the guard is prepared to stay there as long as necessary 
said patrick kirby chief of staff for gov edward d diprete after 
nurses and attendants at the 480bed hospital walked out in a 
contract dispute monday 
seven of the 110 guard troops sent to the hospital had nursing 
training the rest were given nonmedical tasks such as feeding 
washing and dressing patients 
i think its a very dangerous situation for patients in fact i 
think its lifethreatening said thomas romeo director of the 
state department of mental health retardation and hospitals not 
all the individuals up there right now know exactly what theyre 
doing theres not a lot of tolerance for error 
citing the possible harm and the illegality of strikes by state 
employees the state sought a court order to force the employees to 
return to the hospital which mostly handles longterm patients 
superior court judge antonio s almeida said he would issue a 
ruling today after listening to lawyers from both sides present 
their arguments 
joe fargnoli president of local 1350 of the american federation 
of state county and municipal employees said the main issue in the 
contract dispute is not money but the hospitals refusal to fill 
vacant jobs 
we only want the state to honor its contract with us and pull 
together with the employees to restore normality and security here 
at the hospital he said 
patient louise baran herself a registered nurse said she felt 
comfortable about the care she was receiving although she didnt 
fault either side in the dispute she said she was disappointed it 
had reached the point of a walkout 
however 56yearold connie prior a quadriplegic who has been at 
the hospital for two years was incensed by the walkout 
i think this is totally uncalled for ms prior said 
number one should be the patients 
more than a dozen acutecare patients have been transferred to 
other hospitals since the walkout began and the facility has 
stopped admissions officials said 
doctors reported to work as usual monday but about onefifth of 
the 89 attendants and fewer than half the 13 licensed practical 
nurses showed up for the first shift officials said about half the 
26 registered nurses honored the picket line said dan caley a 
spokesman for the state health agency 
diprete called out the national guard late sunday after the union 
voted 41 to reject a proposed 53centanhour raise offered in 
return for concessions on staffing 
a previous fourday sickout ended jan 31 when the guard was 
called in 
under the hospitals latest offer starting salaries for 
attendants would go from 16600 to 17600 and for nurses would 
increase from 18800 to 20000 he said 
contract negotiations broke off friday and no new talks were 
scheduled 
the hospital appealed for volunteers to augument the national 
guard dan mccarthy coordinator of hospital volunteers said the 
facility was seeking about 30 general helpers and 16 nurses only 
about two dozen people volunteered monday said a volunteer 
coordinator who would not give her name 
one striker a therapist who would not give her name said she 
felt no qualms about the walkout i think its for a good cause 
she said we have a medical emergency staff on call in case 
anything should happen its not like were totally abandoning 
them

twentyfive children were rescued from a school bus trapped in 
raging floodwaters as more rain returned today to parts of kentucky 
and tennessee not yet recovered from last weeks downpours 
the ohio river spilled over its banks from louisville ky to 
cairo ill and was expected to continue rising all week the 
national weather service said the high water and stiff current shut 
down a ferry and hindered barge loading 
smaller rivers were also on the rise from kentucky to louisiana 
after a weekend respite from storms that had dumped up to 11 inches 
of rain over the area last week 
the weather service issued a flash flood watch for all of 
tennessee for eastern and southeastern kentucky and west virginia 
and parts of mississippi alabama virginia and ohio 
flooding closed roads and damaged homes in florence ala early 
today and roads were reported under water in central tennessee 
after more than 2 inches of rain fell monday evening 
in western kentucky a 19yearold woman died monday when she 
lost control of her car on a wet highway and hit a truck 
in the central part of the state which received up to 3 inches 
of rain in 24 hours searchers on monday discovered the body of one 
of two men missing since their van got stuck in high water in hardin 
county last thursday the search for the other man resumed this 
morning 
about 50 miles west in stanley ky a school bus tilted on its 
side in flood waters up to its midsection the children and driver 
were inside the bus for at least 30 minutes before they were rescued 
and loaded into two small boats according to firefighter rick 
fulkerson of the stanley volunteer fire department 
none of the children was injured richard coy a daviess county 
sheriffs deputy who discovered the bus said there were some tense 
moments before the boats arrived because the bus was slowly sinking 
in the ditch 
the boat ride was fun but getting stuck wasnt fun said 
fifthgrader marshall coleman it was kind of scary a whole bunch 
of people were crying 
the ohio river ferry between cave in rock ill and marion ky 
shut down monday and its operator bill patton predicted it would 
be out for at least a week 
the river covered the road on the kentucky side patton said 
its swift and full of trees and logs and everything else 
northbound river traffic was having a hard time fighting the 
current patton said while 10 mph is the average speed going 
upriver towboats were fighting to reach speeds of 2 mph 
the ohios high level has interfered with operations at the 
owensboro riverport authority grain cant be loaded onto barges 
again until water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a 
fixed loading spout said port director janet douglas 
of kentuckys major rivers those in the western half of the 
state posed the greatest problems with the new rainfall because of 
backwater flooding from the ohio the weather service said 
the rolling fork and green rivers in central and southwestern 
kentucky respectively were above flood stage today 
at west point ky which lies just south of the ohio mayor gene 
smith said water had receded a few inches monday but 42 houses that 
had to be evacuated the day before remained flooded 
the flood knocked out pumps at a waste treatment plant causing 
raw sewage to be discharged into the river smith said but he said 
the worst appeared to be over 
based on our oldtimers and based on the forecast were not 
anticipating any additional flooding he said 
despite the new rain tennessee officials said only a few 
families in the portland area northeast of nashville had to be 
evacuated due to flooding 
at 1 oclock this morning things looked really dim said 
cecil whaley an operations officer for the tennessee emergency 
management agency we had that front with all that rain coming in 
from arkansas that was supposed to hit us but it turned off and 
headed toward northern mississippi and alabama instead 
in obion county in northwestern tennessee about 130 people 
remained away from their homes after being flooded out last week 
tennessee officials also found at least one bright spot the town 
of lebanon which was hard hit by last weeks floods appeared to be 
escaping the newest round of flooding 
i dont understand these things said said bob cayler 
operations officer with the tennessee emergency management agency 
i just report them

the supreme court ruled today that states may 
use antiracketeering laws to fight pornography but invoked 
freespeech rights to ban the states from seizing before trial the 
contents of adult bookstores 
the justices threw out an obscenity conviction against a fort 
wayne ind bookstore because authorities seized its contents 
before trial but by a 63 vote the justices said prosecutors still 
may use the states antiracketeering law to renew the obscenity 
case 
justice byron r white writing for the court said the 
constitutions freespeech protections do not bar states from using 
alleged acts of obscenity as a basis for an antiracketeering law 
given that the antiracketeering statute totally encompasses 
the obscenity law if the latter is not unconstitutionally vague 
the former cannot be vague either white said 
in other matters acted on today the court 
allowed kentucky to begin enforcing a 1986 abortion law that 
includes provisions for parental notification 
refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a hollywood 
producer for hiring actors to peform sex acts in a film the 
california supreme court had thrown out the conviction as violating 
the producers freedom of expression 
rejected a constitutional attack on a texas seat belt law 
letting stand a 35 fine against a houston lawyer for not buckling 
up 
the court declined to kill a 90 million suit against 
evangelist jimmy swaggart by a defrocked evangelist who swaggart had 
accused of adultery 
let stand rulings that the public has no right to attend 
socalled summary jury trials held in some legal disputes three 
ohio newspapers had sought to force such proceedings to be held in 
open court 
agreed to referee a dispute between the us government and 
american businesses over whether firms receiving money because of 
claims against iran must pay part of the money to the u s 
government 
indianas racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act is 
patterned after the muchused federal act that bears the same 
acronym rico 
states are using such laws with increasing frequency as a 
powerful new wepaon to fight obscenity and organized crime 
white said the indiana law went too far in permitting prosecutors 
to padlock adult bookstores before obscenity trials 
while the constitution generally permits seizure of suspected 
contraband material white said it is otherwise when materials 
presumptively protected by the first amendment are involved 
probable cause to believe that there are valid grounds for 
seizure is insufficient to interrupt the sale of presumptively 
protected books and films he said 
in a dissenting opinion justices john paul stevens william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall said the obscenity charges against 
fort wayne books inc should be thrown out 
stevens writing for all three said indianas law violates the 
constitution by permitting the seizure of a bookstores contents 
after an obscenity conviction 
stevens noted that the law allows the seizure based on a judgment 
that two items sold by the store were obscene 
the law allows prosecutors to cast wide nets and seize the 
obscene those nonobscene yet sexually explicit items even those 
devoid of sexual reference stevens said 
the law was used in march 1984 against three fort wayne 
bookstores selling sexually explict material law enforcement 
officials padlocked the stores and seized all inventory 
the three fort wayne stores were allowed to reopen in april 1985 
but only one fort wayne books remains in business 
the supreme court today also upheld rulings that permit the 
howard county ind sheriffs office to charge ronald sappenfield 
with distributing obscene material and violating the state rico law 
that case has yet to go trial 
the cases are fort wayne books vs indiana 87470 and 
sappenfield vs indiana 87614

i didnt mean to lie but i got really scared and didnt know 
what to do or who to tell anderson said in a statement filed in 
city court i am very sorry for all the problems that i have 
caused i was just scared about this

president bush said today the allegations 
against john tower have been gunned down by a thorough fbi 
report and he called on the senate to move swiftly to confirm the 
former senator as secretary of defense 
fielding questions from reporters at the white house bush said 
he had personally reviewed the fbi background report on tower 
what i got from it was that there has been a very unfair 
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo over and over again 
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up he said 
tower has been plagued by reports of womanizing and problem 
drinking and by questions about his financial ties to defense 
contractors the senate armed services committee had postponed a 
vote on the nomination while the fbi report was being compiled and 
may decide today or wednesday when to vote 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee had no immediate response to the presidents declaration 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine told reporters he 
didnt know when the committee would act on the nomination but 
noted that the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been at 
the request of the white house 
mitchell also said it was premature to speculate about 
whether the senate would hold a closeddoor session to review the 
tower file 
the fbi report was delivered on monday to the white house which 
forwarded it to the senate committee 
i hope that the senate will move forthrightly on this 
nomination the president said 
published reports have said the fbi found that tower drank 
excessively in the 1970s but no longer does so asked about that 
and whether the former senator had undergone treatment bush replied 
i say there is no evidence of any kind of disease of 
alcoholism none none whatsoever 
towers nomination has become the longestrunning controversy in 
the early weeks of the new administration and bush has gone out of 
his way today to demonstrate support for his nominee at several 
turns 
ive never wavered in my support for john tower he said 
id say all of these charges weve read about have been rumor 
and a lot of it vicious rumor 
john tower is qualified to be secretary of defense hell be a 
good secretary of defense the allegations against him that have 
been hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of 
fact bush added 
with his appearance in the white house briefing room the 
president gave his personal stamp to what his senior aides already 
had been telling reporters about the fbi report 
it was very exhaustive interviews with anybody and 
everybody press secretary marlin fitzwater said of a 140page 
report delivered to the white house on monday and quickly 
handcarried to capitol hill by the presidents counsel c boyden 
gray 
it did not corroborate the personal charges against the 
former senator nor did it show any problems with illegal campaign 
contributions said fitzwater 
the wall street journal reported in todays editions meantime 
that as a senator from texas profited from a lucrative oil 
investment arranged in 1981 by a corpus christi lawyer whose son was 
nominated to the federal bench by tower 
towers financial disclosure forms indicate he put up no capital 
and financed his entire investment with a fiveyear promissory note 
from a nowdefunct san antonio bank the newspaper said 
the money was used to purchase machinery which was leased to a 
corpus christi drilling firm under terms that allowed tower to pay 
off the note while earning about 25000 from the rental payments 
and resale of the equipment in 1986 it said 
the newspaper citing unidentified people familiar with towers 
finances said the late hayden head sr was instrumental in 
arranging the transaction which closely coincided with the 
appointment of hayden head jr to a federal judgeship 
a spokesman for tower denied there had been any quid pro quo 
between the oil investment and the judicial nomination the journal 
said 
at the capitol on monday nunn seemed reticent to discuss the 
latest development in the troubled tower confirmation process 
just before going into a closeddoor meeting with gray nunn was 
asked whether the white house statements made him feel pressure to 
move quickly to a committee vote 
the only pressure i feel is to get the facts before 
making this decision he replied 
however while awaiting the report nunn had also said were 
not going to hold up a vote in the committee any longer 
he and sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the 
panel indicated that if new questions arise later they could be 
dealt with later in the confirmation process 
nunn and warner said in advance of the meeting with gray that 
they would make no comment to reporters afterward gray eluded 
reporters after giving the report to the two senators 
although they did not elaborate on a specific timetable in brief 
remarks to reporters on monday nunn and warner had indicated 
previously that the committee might vote on the nomination by the 
end of the week if the fbi report was received early in the week 
mitchell has said he will bring the tower nomination to a prompt 
vote on the senate floor once the committee decides what it wants to 
do 
towers nomination has been stalled by numerous allegations of 
excessive drinking and womanizing many senators also expressed 
concerns about their former colleagues close ties to defense 
contractors tower received more than 1 million as a consultant for 
major defense firms since he left the senate in 1985 
meanwhile staff members of nunns committee met monday with 
berne indahl a state department security officer indahl had been 
sent to geneva in 1986 to investigate allegations of security 
breaches in the us delegation to missile talks with the soviet 
union while tower was a member of the contingent said congressional 
sources who requested anonymity 
on sunday indahl had spoken to investigators of a house 
subcommittee about a separate inquiry that had turned up allegations 
against tower at that meeting the sources said indahl 
corroborated a report that tower while in geneva had used his 
secretaries as mistresses 
the sources would not go into detail on what indahl told the 
house committee

announcement after a period of prolonged and careful 
deliberation i have determined that i can better represent the 
values and the priorities of north floridians in the state of 
florida as a republican

mississippi river the 2nd congressional district stretches along 
the states northern border from near panama city to just west of 
jacksonville and includes tallahasse the state capital

in state elections but recently have been showing more support for 
republican candidates especially in the last two presidential 
elections

democratic congressional seats the 4th and 6th congressional 
districts eroded the democrats majority in the delegation in the 
senate republicans gained one of floridas seats when connie mack

states may not offer the equivalent of patent 
protection for utilitarian and design ideas left unprotected by 
federal law the supreme court ruled unanimously today 
the justices killed a lawsuit in which a florida boat 
manufacturer charged that its design for a fiberglass recreational 
boat was duplicated illegally by a competitor 
the court said only congress and not individual states can 
decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design 
ideas 
it is for congress to determine if the present system of design 
and utility patents is ineffectual in promoting the useful arts in 
the context of industrial design justice sandra day oconnor 
wrote for the court 
she said a florida law that would have protected the boat 
manufacturers design conflicts with the strong federal policy 
favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent 
protection 
bonito boats inc in 1976 developed an original hull design that 
was marketed as model 5vbr 
a hardwood model was created from engineering drawings and the 
model was then sprayed with fiberglass to create a mold the mold 
then was used to produce the finished fiberglass boats for sale 
no patent was obtained for the utilitarian or design aspects of 
the hull or for the process by which the hull was manufactured 
after the model 5vbr proved a marketing success the florida 
legislature enacted a law that in effect gave bonita boats a 
statelevel monopoly for making hulls that way 
bonito boats later invoked the state law in suing thunder craft 
boats for allegedly using the same process a florida trial judge 
upheld by the state supreme court threw out the lawsuit after 
ruling that the state law giving protection to bonito boats 
creativity impermissibly conflicts with federal patent law 
todays decision upheld the state court rulings 
congress has considered extending various forms of limited 
protection to industrial design either through the copyright laws or 
by relaxing the restrictions on the availability of design 
patents oconnor noted 
congress explicitly refused to take this step in the copyright 
laws and despite sustained criticism for a number of years it has 
declined to alter the patent protections presently available for 
industrial design she said 
the case is bonito boats vs thunder craft boats 871346

playwright vaclav havel today was 
convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison for his role in a 
rally commemorating a student who killed himself to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion 
havel czecholovakias bestknown dissident denied charges that 
he incited people to antistate and antisocialist activity 
in the oneday trial he was convicted of inciting participation 
in the banned jan 16 rally and for obstructing the duty of a public 
official 
on the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum term 
of two years on the second to another six months in prison 
prosecutors had asked for a oneyear term but judge helena hlavata 
ruled on a ninemonth prison term and rejected a proposed fine 
the prosecution of havel and other opposition activists has gone 
on despite widespread criticism at home in the east bloc and the 
west that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly with 
dissent seven other activists from the charter 77 human rights 
committee and other independent movements also went on trial today 
authorities banned a number of western diplomats and 
representatives from human rights organizations from the trials 
havel 52 who helped found the charter 77 movement has been 
harassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his 
1975 open letter to communist party leader gustav husak accused 
authorities of creating a bureaucratic order of gray monotony that 
stifles all individuality 
havel was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years in 
jail in 1979 authorities have banned his plays which are widely 
acclaimed in productions abroad 
he told the court that charter 77 was a peaceful organization 
whose sole intention to ensure respect for human rights 
for 12 years we have offered dialogue on these things for 12 
years the state power has not responded to our initiative havel 
said 
more than 100 havel sympathizers had jammed a small stairwell 
leading to the courtroom loudly cheering him earlier today when 
police led him to the trial 
havels brother ivan said havel did not take part in a jan 16 
flowerlaying ceremony in a downtown prague square but was detained 
on the square an hour later 
the seven other defendants all activists with charter 77 and 
other independent groups face hooliganism charges in connection 
with the jan 16 gathering the charges carry a maximum twoyear 
jail sentence 
the seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory of 
jan palach the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlier 
to protest the sovietled invasion that quashed communist reforms in 
czechoslovakia 
the arrests came during a week of protests that were the largest 
in prague since palachs death 
ota veverka one of the seven charter 77 human rights group 
activists being tried said what happened on wenceslas square was 
not a criminal act but an assault by police 
most of the defendants said they came separately to the square to 
lay flowers in palachs memory and no demonstration was planned 
more than 2000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling for 
the government to release the dissidents 
it was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishment 
intellectuals sided with opposition activists in public 
the trials also have drawn an official protest from the hungarian 
writers union as well as criticism from the united states britain 
and other western governments and groups 
last month nato warsaw pact and 12 other european nations 
agreed on new human rights accords in vienna 
britain and the united states have charged that the trials 
violate the spirit of those accords nine independent groups in 
czechoslovakia have appealed to all 35 states that signed the new 
accords to protest the trials 
those on trial are charter 77 activists sasha vondra and jana 
sternova and independent activists veverka nemec jana petrova

the supreme court ruled today that states may 
not give preferential treatment to religious publications by 
exempting them from sales taxes imposed on other books newspapers 
and magazines 
by a 63 vote the justices said a nowdefunct texas statute 
violated the constitution 
the decision presumably will force the state to give sales tax 
refunds to nonreligious publications or impose the levy against 
religious organizations that were exempt 
five justices william j brennan thurgood marshall john paul 
stevens harry a blackmun and sandra day oconnor said the texas 
law violated the constitutions required separation of church and 
state 
justice byron r white said the law violated freepress 
guarantees in the constitution by taxing nonreligious publications 
while exempting others solely on the basis of religious content 
dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
brennan writing only for himself marshall and stevens said 
texass previous sales tax exemption for religious publications 
lacks a secular objective and effectively endorses religious 
belief 
moreover brennan said nothing in the constitutions guarantee 
of the free exercise of religion bars states from imposing such 
taxes on religious periodicals 
in a separate concurring opinion blackmun and oconnor said 
while the texas law violates the separation of church and state 
some exemptions for religious publications could be constitutional 
for example said blackmun in an opinion joined by oconnor 
a state statute might exempt the sale not only of religious 
literature distributed by a religious organization but also of 
philosophical literature distributed by nonreligious organizations 
devoted to such matters of conscience as life and death good and 
evil being and nonbeing right and wrong 
in a dissenting opinion joined by rehnquist and kennedy scalia 
said the ruling appears to topple exemptions for religious 
publications granted by many other states 
in short religious tax exemptions of the type the court 
invalidates today permeate the state and federal legal codes and 
have done so for many years scalia said 
texas imposed a sales tax on books and periodicals from october 
1984 through october 1987 but the law exempted periodicals 
published or distributed by a religious faith and that consist 
wholly of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith 
the texas legislature revoked the sales tax on all books and 
periodicals in october 1987 
texas monthly a general interest magazine with a circulation of 
about 280000 challenged the exemption for religious publications 
after it paid more than 149000 in sales taxes in 1985 
the magazine is seeking a refund of the money 
the supreme court in 1987 struck down an arkansas tax imposed on 
sales of general interest magazines but exempted newspapers and 
religious professional trade and sports magazines 
the court in that case said states have a heavy burden of proof 
to justify taxing publications based on their content 
the texas law presented a different situation everything but 
religious publications had been taxed 
the case acted on today is texas monthly vs bullock 871245

bush now ill be glad to take a couple of questions 
as you know were leaving on this trip tomorrow and there may be 
some on that which i doubt laughter 
terry 
q mr president whats your reaction to irans death threats 
against the british author salman rushdie and do you think that the 
british allies or that the western allies should impose economic 
sanctions against iran in retaliation 
a well i strongly support the ec12 declaration in response to 
the iranian threats against rushdie 
however offensive that book may be inciting murder and offering 
rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the norms of 
civilized behavior 
and our position on terrorism is wellknown 
in the light of irans incitement should any action be taken 
against american interests the government of iran can expect to be 
held accountable 
and so that is my view on it and i think the ec12 did the right 
thing 
q how about the economic sanctions part of it 
a they will be discussing that im sure but i dont know where 
we go from there 
as you know we have certain economic sanctions and ill be 
meeting in i know ill be talking to president mitterrand and i 
expect this subject will come up and maybe others but brent are 
we in im not sure exactly of the bilaterals were having but it 
will be a matter 
helen and then well start moving around trying to get to the 
back of the room 
q basically in a way a question about your trip there is a 
widespread perception that you dont have a foreign policy that you 
have permitted the russians to move into the vacuum in the middle 
east you were surprised on central america that your go slow 
attitude really has let the russians grab the ball 
a well ive never heard such an outrageous hypothesis 
laughter 
the fact that the soviets you failed to point out that the 
soviets moved out of afghanistan 
some good things happening 
i dont worry about a trip by mr shevardnadze to the middle east 
i have no worry about that 
q inaudible 
a no it happened just this week 
and theyre out of there 
i dont worry about that 
and we have a foreign policy 
we are reviewing appropriately eastwest relations the way we 
look at south america 
but this doesnt trouble me one bit 
weve established and are following on with certain principles 
that are out there 
and i think that jim baker when he came back made very clear that 
the nato alliance still looks to the united states 
ill have an opportunity to discuss a lot of things as we go on 
this particular trip 
so i simply dont agree with that 
i really hadnt ever heard such a negative approach to foreign 
policy 
q inaudible 
a middle east policy its to encourage discussions between king 
hussein and the israelis 
and to build on the progress that has been made already 
and i think it was ive already said that i think it was very 
useful the changes that the plo advocated 
now we want to see that theres some followon there 
so the policy is set 
i campaigned on what the policy is 
and i think its quite clear 
the question is what specific steps we take next and i dont 
want to be rushing out because mr shevardnadze went to the middle 
east 
id like to have for the first step we take of that nature to be 
a prudent step 
so the principles are there and i think were you know weve 
got to now flesh that out and figure out what we do specifically 
yes

a university of virginia professor cautioned 
today against taking drastic action to combat the atmospheres 
greenhouse effect until scientists learn whether it causes droughts 
heat waves and other climatic changes 
our policy should be commensurate with the state of our 
scientific knowledge dr patrick j michaels told a house energy 
and commerce subcommittee studying the global warming problem 
dr stephen schneider a scientist for the national center for 
atmospheric research agreed that better information is needed but 
he said action was needed now as insurance against catastrophic 
change 
the greenhouse effect gives you an additional reason to redce 
burning of fossil fuels and take other action to benefit the 
environment the boulder colo climate specialist said 
the subcommittee was told that it may take two decades to learn 
whether the greenhouse effect is responsible for temperature changes 
like the searing heat waves of last summer 
schneider and michaels agreed that scientists are unable to 
attribute last summers heat to the buildup of greenhouses gases 
and schneider showed the committee slides of news articles that he 
said prematurely blamed last summers temperatures on the building 
up greenhouse gases 
schneider said another decade or possibly two will be 
required to be sure that the warming of the 1980s the warmest 
decade recorded on a global basis will continue into the 1990s 
and beyond 
i expect it will but i cant prove it of course he said 
michaels a professor of environmental sciences said climate 
experts have a clouded vision of future global warming and told 
lawmakers that basing sweeping environmental policy on such 
uncertainties is especially risky even if the policy is otherwise 
rational 
michaels has warned in past statements against public 
hysteria and the politics of fear toward global warming 
the greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earths atmosphere 
trap radiant heat near the planets surface the more gases the 
more heat 
the gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they 
are to outgoing infrared energy mars a planet with a thin 
predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere has a mean temperature that 
is below that of deep freezers venus with a thick largely carbon 
dioxide atmosphere is hotter than an oven 
the earths atmosphere on the other hand has been just right to 
support life it has not become an iceball because of heat trapped 
by greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane fluorocarbons nitrous 
oxide 
in addition to natural buildup the greenhouse gases have 
increased dramatically because of human activities including 
burning of fossil fuels coal oil and gas and destruction of 
tropical rain forests 
the problem comes in trying to predict the future 
michaels denied that hes trying to throw roadblocks in the way 
of sensible environmental policy and agreed global climatic 
change is potentially the most serious environmental disturbance 
ever created by technological man 
but he added my purpose is rather to underscore that policy 
should be commensurate with the state of scientific knowledge 
although theres no single set of figures to show how much the 
erth has warmed michaels said the planet at best appears to have 
warmed up only half as much as our average forecasts indicate it 
should have 
he added that the greenhouse effect may be causing a rise in 
nighttime temperatures only a potentially beneficial effect that 
could lengthen growing seasons and it is well known he added 
that longterm climate records sometimes warm because their 
surroundings become more urbanized 
schneider in proposing action now suggested steppedup 
investments in efficient energy production accelerated testing of 
nonfossil fuel alternatives development of climateadapted crop 
strains coastal planning to deal with rising sea levels and storm 
surges 
delaying rapid change can buy us time to adapt more easily and 
provide insurance against the not remote possibility of catastrophic 
rates of change he said

five children died when a fire raged through an apartment complex 
in chester pa and four children died in a new york city row house 
blaze while playing with matches or a lighter authorities said 
in both fires monday hysterical mothers watched helplessly as 
flames destroyed their homes and families 
in new york two mothers desperately threw buckets of water on 
what authorities called a wall of fire but to no avail 
in the pennsylvania fire police officer michael kruczaj said he 
arrived at the scene to find 25yearold michelle arnold outside her 
burning apartment holding one of her six children a critically 
injured 13monthold boy 
my babies my babies theyre still inside ms arnold 
shouted at kruczaj he recalled later 
but the officer said the fire and smoke were too thick for him to 
attempt rescuing ms arnolds other five children three boys and 
two girls 2 to 6 years old all died in the blaze 
the fire started monday afternoon under a bed and officials 
suspect the children may have been playing with matches fire capt 
joseph cliffe said the official cause remains undetermined 
authorities said early reports of an explosion were erroneous 
thirtynine of the 80 twostory units in the crosby square 
apartment complex were damaged authorities said it was not known 
how many people were in the building at the time of the fire or how 
many were evacuated 
witnesses said ms arnold was outside the apartment building 
talking to friends when the fire broke out she ran inside and was 
able to rescue her 13month old son marlon just before kruczaj 
arrived authorities said 
marlon was in critical condition today with burns over 70 percent 
of his body and suffering from smoke inhalation officials said 
the new york fire broke out monday afternoon in a brooklyn 
apartment 
according to fire department spokesman efrain parrilla four 
children were playing in a bedroom and their mothers sisters gail 
and devoria murray were in a kitchen at the rear of the home when 
they smelled smoke 
when they went to investigate they found one door blocked by a 
mattress and another door blocked by a bunk bed parrilla said 
devoria and gail tried to put out the fire with pots and pans 
of water but it was to no avail that mattress was like a wall of 
fire parrilla said 
harry isaacs a neighbor said the sight of the two hysterical 
mothers trying to douse the flames was enough to give you 
nightmares 
by the time we got there they were gone they had no 
chance said fire lt philip mcdonnell 
he said firefighters found the children ages 4 to 8 atop one 
another on the lower portion of a bunk bed on the top floor of the 
threestory brick building 
fire marshal john regan said it appeared the children had been 
playing with matches or a lighter 
an unused smoke detector was found in a closet regan said

postal workers accused of traffic violations 
must stand trial in state courts a unanimous supreme court ruled 
today 
the decision limits the federal governments power to block some 
state prosecutions of federal workers 
the justices ordered two us postal service mail carriers to 
stand trial in california state courts 
both cases stem from traffic accidents in santa clara county 
in one kathryn isabella mesa was accused of 
misdemeanormanslaughter after her mail truck collided with and 
killed a bicyclist in the other shabbir a ebrahim was charged 
with speeding and failing to yield after his mail truck collided 
with a police car 
both defendants succeeded in tranferring their cases to a federal 
court but the 9th us circuit court of appeals in 1987 sent the 
cases back to the state courts 
the supreme court today upheld the appeals court ruling 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court rejected 
justice department arguments that permitting state prosecutions in 
such cases could interfere with federal officials in performance of 
their duties 
only if a federal issue is directly at stake may a prosecution be 
shifted to federal court oconnor said she also noted that 
transferring cases like traffic violations to federal court would 
impose heavy burdens on local state prosecutors 
we can discern no federal interest in potentially forcing local 
district attorneys to choose between prosecuting traffic violations 
hundreds of miles from the municipality in which the violations 
occurred or abandoning those prosecutions oconnor said 
a federal law providing for removal of states cases to federal 
court was enacted in response to new englands opposition to a trade 
embargo declared during the war of 1812 between the united states 
and great britain 
federal customs officials were given authority then to board 
vessels in order to collect duties assuring they would avoid 
prosecution in state courts for any alleged misconduct in the 
performance of their duties 
the 9th circuit court had noted that in the california case there 
was no claim by the mail carriers that their allegedly illegal 
conduct was justified by the duties they were performing 
the case is mesa vs california 871206

iran recalled its ambassadors from common market countries today 
a day after the 12 european countries decided to withdraw their 
envoys from tehran to protest ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order 
that novelist salman rushdie be killed 
iran said its move was in direct reponse to the european economic 
communitys decision monday to recall ambassadors from tehran and 
suspend highlevel diplomatic exchanges 
hours later britain which already said it would withdraw its 
entire embassy staff from tehran announced it was expelling the 
iranian charge daffaires and his aide to protest the death threats 
it is neither possible nor sensible to conduct a normal 
relationship with iran british foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe told the house of commons 
president bush said today he strongly supports european countries 
that have withdrawn their ambassadors from iran 
however offensive that book may be inciting murder and 
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the 
norms of civilized behavior bush said 
the united states has no diplomatic relations with iran 
in a communique the iranian foreign ministry called khomeinis 
weekold order for the death of rushdie a consensus judgment of 
all moslem leaders throughout the world irans official islamic 
republic news agency reported 
many moslems consider rushdies book the satanic verses 
blasphemous although some moslems have criticized khomeinis order 
that rushdie be killed the book has been banned by seven nations 
including india egypt and pakistan 
irna quoted the foreign ministry communique as saying respect for 
islam and its values will remain an inviolable principle in 
relations between iran and other countries 
britain said monday it was withdrawing its embassy staff from the 
iranian capital and closing its embassy the two countries resumed 
diplomatic relations in november after a 17month break 
rushdie born into a moslem family in india now lives in london 
and is a british citizen the novel was first published in britain 
in september 
sweden and norway although not members of the common market 
recalled their ambassadors from iran today foreign minister sten 
andersson of sweden said his nation also will cancel a visit by a 
trade delegation scheduled for next month unless the death threat 
against rushdie is rescinded 
the european communitys foreign ministers at a meeting monday 
in brussels belgium decided to recall their countrys ambassadors 
for consultation at britains request 
prime minister hussein musavi of iran called the ec action a 
useless maneuver certain to harm the european community rather 
than iran irna reported he said it was the western countries 
which need to win irans favor rather than the other way around 
the agency said 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani criticized the 
recall as a big mistake and said it proved rushdies novel was a 
plot designed by western imperialism to fight true islam irna 
reported 
we do not fear such threats he added we are prepared to 
follow our own path at an cost 
irna quoted moslem leaders in tehran as calling for severing ties 
with britain because british colonialism and the great satan the 
united states had played a basic role in insulting the prophet 
mohammed 
the statement called rushdies novel slanderous and asked the 
worlds moslems to carry out khomeinis order that the author be 
killed 
iranian clerics have put a 52 million bounty on the authors 
head rushdie is reportedly in hiding under police guard 
many moslems say the satanic verses portrays the prophet 
mohammeds wives as prostitutes and suggests that he rather than 
allah was the source of the koran islams holy book 
the novel has prompted moslem protests around the world in 
pakistan and india seven people died in the protests 
publishers in france west germany greece and turkey have 
canceled plans to publish rushdies book and it has been pulled 
from bookstore shelves in japan many us bookstores have also 
removed the novel from display 
in a letter today to premier michel rocard of france the more 
than 500 authors in the french section of the international pen club 
called for publication of the satanic verses the authors said 
they were confident authorities could assure the publishers safety 
last week christian bourgois the french publisher with rights to 
the novel said it was suspending publication to protect its 
employees 
on monday iranian leaders met at khomeinis home to reaffirm the 
execution order and iranian television showed the 
fundamentalist patriarch sitting on a balcony above a crowd of 
several hundred men who waved clenched fists and chanted death to 
america and long live khomeini 
after khomeini called for rushdies killing iranian president 
ali khamenei said an apology from rushdie might lead to a pardon 
the 41yearold writer apologized saturday for any distress his 
book has caused moslems 
but khomeini rejected the apology neither he nor irna made any 
mention of khameneis statement on the issue suggesting a split in 
iranian leadership 
the decision by the european countries to recall their 
ambassadors was a setback for iranian moderates hopes of improving 
relations with western nations iran recently has expressed interest 
in bolstering ties and receiving aid to help rebuilt its economy 
battered by eight years of war with iraq

president bush calling irans death threats 
against author salman rushdie deeply offensive to the norms of 
civilized behavior today backed european countries that have 
withdrawn their ambassadors from iran 
bush was asked about further us sanctions against the 
government of ayatollah khomeini who has called on muslims to send 
rushdie to hell noting existing economic sanctions against 
iran bush said only that i dont know where well go from there 
bush also said american booksellers deserve the protection of the 
law against threats of retaliation if they display copies of 
rushdies novel the satanic verses several book dealers 
including two large chains have taken the book off the shelves 
however offensive that book may be inciting murder and 
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the 
norms of civilized behavior said the president ive just laid 
down how i feel in terms of in this case the imam exhorting people 
to go out and commit murder 
at a meeting with reporters on the eve of a sixday trip to the 
far east bush also reiterated his support for his embattled 
pentagon nominee john tower and urged the senate to move 
forthrightly to approve the nomination 
the president said the allegations that have held up action on 
towers nomination were very unfair treatment of this man by rumor 
and innuendo he said a new fbi report released monday had 
gunned down the allegations of misconduct 
i saw this as a reaffirmation of what i knew all along john 
tower is qualified to be secretary of defense he added 
anybody thats been through this ordeal will be stronger not 
weaker bush said 
bush who leaves wednesday for japan south korea and china was 
asked at one point if the united states had given up momentum in 
foreign affairs to the soviets whose foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze has been in the middle east on a peace mission 
bush brushed off the suggestion as preposterous 
later when asked what the soviet role in the region ought to be 
he replied i think it should be a limited role and i think 
thats what its going to be 
i dont want to be stampeded by the fact that the soviet 
foreign minister takes a trip to the middle east he said in my 
view thats a good thing 
at a meeting in brussels monday of the 12 foreign ministers of 
the european community nations it was decided to withdraw 
diplomatic representatives from iran in the wake of khomeinis call 
for the assassination of rushdie an indianborn british citizen 
living in london 
rushdie has been in hiding under police protection since the 
threat 
iran announced today it was withdrawing its diplomats from 
european nations 
bush called reporters to the white house press room to announce 
that secondterm rep bill grant of florida was switching his 
registration from democratic to republican 
this is good news for our party not only in florida not only 
in the south but nationally bush said 
grants defection startled democratic leaders it took me by 
surprise house speaker jim wright said i hope hes happy 
on other topics bush 
sought to allay some us fears that the japanese own too much 
american property it is important if we believe in open markets 
that people be allowed to invest here just as id like to see more 
openness for american investors in other countries we have to 
do a better job of knocking down barriers to american products 
overseas he said 
said id like to find some way to do something about easy 
access to automatic weapons but the president a strong opponent of 
gun control added that i want to be the president that protects 
the rights of people to have arms 
declared im not ruling anything in or out on star wars 
the nuclear defense shield asked about budget aide richard darmans 
statement that further star wars development was conditional on the 
outcome of a 90day review bush said im not going to close any 
doors or open any were going to have to make some tough 
choices lets wait and see what the review produces 
conceded that his effort to defeat former ku klux klan leader 
david duke in louisiana may have been viewed by voters as improper 
or overkill but he added that dukes record is one of racism 
and bigotry and im sorry i just felt i had to speak out duke 
was elected as a republican to a seat in the louisiana house

q mr president the fbis final or presumably final report on 
senator tower is now in you are reported to have read some of it 
the senate committee has it i would like to know what you got from 
it and also whether you have any reason to believe that the senate 
will go forward any reason from private conversations with members 
of the armed services committee will go forward with a favorable 
vote on this nomination 
a what i got from it and i reviewed some of the more the 
parts that related to some of the allegations against tower what i 
got from it was that there has been a very unfair treatment of this 
man by rumor and innuendo over and over again rumors surfacing 
with no no facts to back them up 
and i saw this as a reaffirmation of what ive felt all along 
and that is that john tower is qualified to be secretary of defense 
he will be a good secretary of defense although the report didnt 
answer that 
but the allegations against him that have been hanging over this 
simply have been gunned down in terms of fact 
and so thats positive 
and i had a little preview so when i held my thumbs up i was 
glad to get that report 
and i hope that the senate will move forthrightly on this 
nomination 
so and i dont know brit what where it stands 
i talked to i had some of the leaders down this morning but 
the only one i got to talk to on this was bob dole 
and id like to see it go forward obviously 
q if i might follow 
a i have never wavered in my support for john tower 
q if i could follow up sir theres a report in the wall street 
journal this morning that senator tower promoted a federal judgeship 
for the son of a man with whom he had done business for his own 
personal benefit and i was wondering if thats news to you sir 
and if or if it troubles you in any way 
a i never heard such a report and id you know one thing 
after another 
and youre telling me something i dont know anything about 
yes 
q mr president does this announcement by congressman grant 
this morning overcome the embarrassment to the party of the election 
saturday of david duke a former member of the ku klux klan and do 
you intend to you came out for his opponent in the election so 
did former president reagan what does the party do next about david 
duke 
a well ill leave that to lee 
but i strongly support what our national chairman lee atwater has 
said in this matter 
and maybe there was some feeling in metairie la that the 
president of the united states involving himself in a state 
legislative election was improper or overkill 
ive heard read that 
and i cant deny that 
but what i can affirm is i did what i did because of principle 
and lee has done what he has done because of principle and this man 
his record is one of racism and bigotry and im sorry i just felt 
i had to speak out 
but whether it helped or hurt i dont know 
q mr president you said during your speech to the joint 
session of congress that your support for the strategic defense 
initiative was unqualified but the office of management and budget 
director richard darman when he briefed on your budget said that 
it was conditional on the outcome of this 90day review thats 
coming up is it or is it not conditional and would you rule out 
curtailing the program to an accidental launch protection system 
a im not ruling anything in or out 
i have stated my support for the principle of sdi 
i have not favored what some would call premature deployment 
but on the other hand i will be very interested in seeing what this 
overall review comes up with and im not going to close any doors or 
open any in regards to this or any other systems 
were going to have to make some tough choices on defense 
im aware of that and so lets wait and see what the review 
produces 
lesley 
q mr president back on john tower if we could youve said 
that the process has been unfair and i would like to ask you 
specifically about sam nunn who some people say will now run 
defense policy because john tower has been so weakened and damaged 
by this drip drip drip of allegations

oliver l north placed himself above the 
law by lying to congress and shredding documents to conceal his 
support of the nicaraguan rebels a prosecutor told jurors today at 
the opening of the former presidential aides irancontra trial 
associate independent counsel john w keker said norths lies to 
congressional committees and to the attorney general amount to a 
crime that goes to the soul of our selfgovernment 
but norths lawyer brendan sullivan countered that the 
defense says to you he is not guilty on all charges he never broke 
the law he followed instructions of higher authority 
keker then sullivan delivered their opening statements each 
describing a different north the first person to go on trial in the 
irancontra affair 
he was doing his job as he understood it he was doing his duty 
as he understood it sullivan said if he didnt then there 
could be death resulting to the people he worked with and dangers 
resulting to the united states 
the need for secrecy is no excuse for lying to congress 
keker told the jury lying to congress is a crime 
you dont have to be a political scientist to understand why 
thats so keker said congress enacts the law the president 
approves it and enforces it if they start lying to eachother our 
system of government is not going to work 
a year after it passed the 1984 boland amendment banning us 
military assistance to the nicaraguan contras congress received 
news reports that north then a marine lieutenant colonel was 
secretly raising money for the rebels from foreign countries and 
private donors and providing tactical military advice 
north and his boss at the time national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane decided they didnt want congress to know what colonel 
north had been doing they decided they would not tell congress 
keker said they decided they would place themselves above the law 
and not tell congress about colonel norths activities 
similar inquiries a year later were met with false answers from 
north including a meeting with the house intelligence committee at 
the white house when the national security council aide looked 
them right in the eye and he lied keker said 
he said north pocketed some of the travelers checks a contra 
leader gave to him to cover expenses incurred helping the rebels 
colonel north used that 4000 like it was his personal piggy 
bank to buy groceries tires and take his family on a trip 
keker said 
north also accepted installation of a security fence around his 
great falls va house from arms dealer richard v secord who had 
helped sell us arms to iran and divert 15 million in profits to 
buy weapons for the contras the prosecutor said 
the armsforhostages deals with iran were kept secret from 
congress until october 1986 when the roof caved in on this house 
of cards with public disclosures about the irancontra affair he 
said 
when north went to his office on nov 21 1986 the first thing 
he did was take some of the records and change them to make it look 
like what he had been doing he hadnt been doing for the last two 
years keker said 
he wanted to hide that he had already twice lied to the 
congress of the united states keker said and also wanted to hide 
that he and others had diverted money from the iranian arms sales 
to help the contras 
he went into his office and began to change the records shred 
the records destroy the records keker told jurors two days 
later when he lied to thenattorney general edwin meese iii he 
had placed himself above the law again 
north sat raptly at attention as keker spoke occasionally taking 
notes 
norths wife betsy was escorted to her seat in the packed 
courtroom by security guards midway through kekers opening 
statement 
some 100 lawyers reporters and members of the public began 
lining up outside the courtroom for opening arguments in the 
longawaited trial 
the crush of spectators prompted court officials to announce that 
only 15 seats would be set aside for the public including some 
aides to independant counsel lawrence walsh who were hoping to 
observe the proceedings from the audience 
the defense contends that reagan was personally involved in 
offering inducements to third countries to support the contras 
opposing the leftist government in nicaragua and that reagan and a 
handful of top administration officials then directed a coverup of 
the arrangement 
if north hid the arrangement from congress sullivan suggested in 
court filings last week it was because he was directed to do so by 
the president and his aides 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has spent much of the 11 
months since north was indicted wrestling with problems stemming 
from balancing the use of classified material against norths right 
to a fair defense 
national security concerns by the reagan administration led to 
the dropping of the two central charges against north the trial was 
delayed last week due to fears by us intelligence agencies that 
north would be allowed to spill out in the courtroom a mass of 
classified material damaging to the national security 
in a tartly worded opinion issued in december gesell accused the 
defense of trying to force disclosure of irrelevant but sensitive 
classified information to scuttle the case 
the judge rejected a justice department request for more 
stringent controls over state secrets that north wants to present in 
his defense the next day as a jury was being chosen attorney 
general dick thornburgh launched efforts to get the trial delayed 
setting off a complex fight with independent counsel walsh who 
wanted the case to go forward immediately 
thornburgh got the assurances he was seeking last wednesday and a 
supreme court stay that had delayed the trial was lifted 
through it all the jury selected in the case waited to be called 
by gesell 
the nine women and three men jurors chosen feb 9 have one thing 
in common they had almost no exposure to norths nationally 
televised congressional testimony in 1987 in which he admitted 
under limited immunity from prosecution many details touching on 
the events that led to the criminal charges against him 
the jurors include an electronics technician a cashier a clerk 
typist at the labor department a clerical worker who says i dont 
like the news and an unemployed former office manager who says she 
recalled that north was selling something to iran 
north faces 12 criminal charges indicted last march he is the 
first figure in the irancontra affair to come to trial he could 
face up to 60 years in prison and 3 million in fines if convicted 
on all counts 
former national security adviser john poindexter and arms 
supplier albert hakim also face criminal charges in the case but 
along with secord are to be tried separately later 
gesell dismissed two central charges against north on jan 13 
conspiracy and theft counts that accused north of diverting more 
than 14 million in us iran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan 
rebels 
us intelligence agencies feared damage to national security and 
as a result walsh asked to have those two counts thrown out

the rumors and hes not been promulgating a lot of endless 
rumors that have proved to have no basis in fact 
none 
so hes done but the idea that he will run defense policy i 
think hed be the first to say thats not true 
he will be a key player in it and i hope that hell be able to 
support senator tower 
q is senator tower damaged in his ability to speak out for the 
pentagon now that 
a no 
q he has had such a lengthy process 
a no 
anybody thats been through this ordeal with be stronger not 
weaker 
yes 
q but senator nunn is concerned about these reports of senator 
towers drinking problems and the fbi report acknowledges that the 
senator apparently did have a drinking problem in the 1970s do you 
think hes overly concerned and why are you so convinced that this 
wont present a problem 
a because i know senator tower 
i have talked to a lot of people that have worked with senator 
tower

that would make me if i were a senator vote against senator tower 
now senator nunn hes got to reach his own conclusions and i 
think hes been fair

but i hope he reaches the same conclusion that i have reached 
yeah in the back 
q mr president washington dc and other big cities have been 
besieged with violence lately do you see any role at all that the 
federal government can play to help in that area

the supreme court today told federal judges to 
be tougher in secondguessing decisions by pension and welfare plans 
that deny benefits to workers 
in ruling unanimously in a case involving the firestone tire amp 
rubber co the justices said federal judges must evaluate such 
cases just as if the pension and welfare plan officials had not yet 
made any decision 
some federal courts instead have been employing a less stringent 
standard of review generally not disturbing decisions by plan 
officials unless they are found to be arbitrary or capricious 
the dispute ruled on today stemmed from firestones selling its 
plastics division in 1980 to occidental petroleum corp 
the sale affected some 500 workers at firestone plants in 
pottstown pa west caldwell nj perryville and salisbury md 
and baton rouge la 
nearly all the workers were given the opportunity to keep their 
jobs under the new ownership and most accepted 
some workers sought certain benefits from firestone including 
early retirement and severance pay that were included in the three 
firestone welfare and pension plans 
the company denied the benefits it also refused to release 
information about the benefit plans to workers who sought it on 
grounds that the workers no longer were employed by firestone and no 
longer participants in the plans 
the workers sued charging firestone with violating the federal 
employee retirement and income security act of 1974 erisa 
a federal judge threw out the suit ruling that firestone did not 
act in an arbitrary or capricious manner 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated the suit 
the appeals court said workers claims must be examined more closely 
in such cases writing for the supreme court today justice sandra 
day oconnor said the appeals court was right 
oconnor said the more stringent standard of judicial review 
should apply unless the plan gives its administrator or other 
officials the discretionary authority to determine eligibility for 
benefits or to construe the terms of the plan 
the justices told the 3rd circuit court to restudy the issue of 
whether the workers seeking information about the welfare and 
pension plans from firestone qualify as participants who are 
entitled under erisa to such information 
the case is firestone vs bruch 871054

local officials welcomed a plan taking 
effect today to arrest unqualified applicants for political asylum 
but advocates for central american immigrants criticized it as 
meanspirited 
while more than 100 immigrants lined up today to apply for 
political asylum six people including three nuns began a fast 
outside the detention facility in protest of the new immigration and 
naturalization service policy 
we dont plan to finish this fast until we have a specific 
answer from the us government said jose amaya a salvadoran 
residentalien 
amaya said the group was demanding refugee status for salvadoran 
aliens and an end to us military aid to their country their 
protest was in front of the ins port isabel service processing 
center a 315acre detention facility 15 miles northeast of 
brownsville where asylum applications are taken 
on monday alan c nelson commissioner of the ins office here 
said the federal agency will speed up its processing of asylum 
applications and take a tough line on frivolous claims 
for months local elected officials have called on the federal 
government to relieve the burden placed on their communities by 
homeless central americans 
from the standpoint of the city i think it will be good in 
terms of taking people and providing for them in a humanitarian 
way said brownsville mayor ygnacio garza whose city is texas 
southernmost 
the ins plan which will take several weeks to phase in will 
bring more than 500 federal workers to the brownsville area the 
agency will add 269 people to its 375member border patrol between 
del rio and brownsville a stretch of more than 300 miles it also 
will increase its staff of asylum adjudicators in brownsville from 
16 to 74 
immigrants who apply for asylum but dont qualify will be placed 
in detention centers if necessary the ins will build a tent city 
capable of holding up to 5000 detainees officials said 
harlingen mayor bill card whose city on feb 10 evicted the ins 
from its asylumprocessing office over alleged health and safety 
violations described the plan as a good initial first step 
but advocates for the immigrants decried the plan 
brownsville immigration attorney linda yanez said a lengthy 
appeals process a shortage of qualified attorneys and clogged 
immigration court dockets will mean lengthy detention for many under 
the new procedure 
i think were going to see detention for years said ms 
yanez 
a group called the brownsville ad hoc refugee committee 
criticized the new policy as a meanspirited attempt to deter 
political refugees from applying for political asylum 
several local churches helped provide bus tickets for central 
americans who had until midnight monday to leave the area legally 
said mervin mosbacker sr of church world service a nonprofit 
interdenominational relief group 
since jan 9 the ins has been prohibited by a court order from 
restricting the travel of asylum seekers many of whom go to 
california or florida the restraining order expired today 
the adjudication and detention plan announced monday could not 
have been implemented had the order been in place 
nelson said he hoped the plan would slow the wave of immigration 
he said threatened to empty out central america 
we think people will realize in central america that its not 
worth spending your life savings to pay a smuggler to get you into 
the united states because you will not get to stay and work here if 
you do not have a legal basis to come he said 
those denied under the new plan will be placed in deportation 
proceedings held in ins custody and will appear before immigration 
judges where they may resubmit asylum cases 
previously central americans who were denied asylum were given 
30 days to leave the country 
single adults will be held in ins detention centers nelson said 
the ins will put family groups and unaccompanied minors under less 
restrictive custody in shelters operated by the justice departments 
community relations service where they must report for daily roll 
calls 
detention facilities listed in the plan include 1100 beds at the 
ins port isabel service processing center 200 in laredo and 200 in 
el paso 
nelson said a tent camp might be built for up to 5000 people at 
the port isabel center if the population continues to accumulate 
at the current rate the ins estimates that 100000 central 
americans this year would pass through the brownsville area the 
main entry point for asylum seekers from that region 
in the recent past the us has provided political asylum to 
nicaraguans in particular but the ins maintains that most central 
american immigrants do not qualify because they are seeking better 
economic conditions rather than fleeing political persecution

a convicted child molester who taught at a 
cherokee indian school for 14 years said today in videotaped 
testimony to congress that he was surprised he was able to continue 
the illicit activity for so long 
this is strictly hindsight looking back it certainly is a 
phenomenon thats hard to understand said paul wade price who is 
serving a 10year sentence in butner federal correctional 
institution in butner nc 
price pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation but in 
the tape he admitted for the first time that he had abused at least 
25 boys while he taught at the cherokee school in western north 
carolina 
under questioning by ken bellen counsel to a special 
investigative unit of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
price said no one ever tried to stop him even though he believed 
that they knew of his sexual activity with the boys 
prices testimony came as the committee began its third week of 
hearings into corruption of various kinds on the nations indian 
reservations 
a former supervisor of price testified that he was instrumental 
in having price removed from his division as a seventhgrade teacher 
at western carolina universitys campus lab school in 1971 arthur 
justice then director of the lab school had a son who was in the 
seventh grade at the school when price taught there 
justice said that his son told him of cases of sexual molestation 
by price with other seventhgraders on an overnight camping trip 
justice said he told the school superintendent about the incident 
and the superintendent waited until the end of the year to dismiss 
price 
justice said that when he found out that price was teaching at 
the bureau of indian affairs school on the cherokee reservation he 
wrote a letter to the school principal and warned him about price 
however price was not dismissed until 14 years later 
justice said that while all 50 states have child abusereporting 
laws the federal government does not 
in 1974 congress required states to enact such laws as a 
requirement for receiving federal aid 
justice who has had experience in enforcing these laws said 
even a suspicion of child abuse must be reported and a followup 
investigation must be conducted within 24 hours 
i strongly believe there needs to be some federal 
legislation he said he said there is no federal law to stop 
price from going to another indian school and committing the same 
crime again 
at the close of his testimony price said 
ive had time of course in prison to reflect over this and 
the seriousness of it fondling is you know in my mind i was 
thinking it really doesnt hurt anybody but i know now how much it 
does hurt we just must find a way to help the children first and 
of course the molesters also above all the children who really 
dont know what theyre getting into

a well i hope so 
but certainly in washington we have a responsibility its a 
federal city and a lot of the funds come obviously come from the 
federal government 
but there isnt any easy answer to that and yet i you know 
campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law on being tough on 
criminals on more prison space 
and i think that those things all will be caught up in our new 
antidrug effort that im looking to bill bennett to lead 
and so its a complicated problem where everybody in the country 
has a stake in it 
everybody should be trying to do something about it 
and yes i think the federal government has a role in that 
q if i may follow is there any federal money for it is this 
something that you really do not have the resources to attack 
a yes there will be federal money and i wish we had more 
yeah charles 
q mr president 
q mr president 
a how far do we go to be democratic here 
no thats too far here laughter 
q mr president you said in answer to helens question that you 
wanted your first step in the middle east to be prudent what do you 
mean by a prudent step what do you have in mind 
a what i have in mind is i dont want to just send somebody 
charging off on a mission to counter mr shevardnadzes trip to see 
mubarak and others 
lets do something thats going to hopefully have results 
and im not saying we have to know that a trip by the secretary 
or a trip by instructions to an ambassador are going to result in 
a settled policy everythings settled in the middle east 
but i dont want to be stampeded by the fact that the soviet 
foreign minister takes a trip to the middle east 
so its in my view thats a good thing 
q what role do you think mr shevardnadze and the soviets could 
and should be playing 
a i think it should be a limited role and i think thats what 
its going to be 
q mr president 
a and thats exactly the way it should be and i think the people 
in the middle east feel that way 
but the fact that he goes there really shouldnt be bad 
yes 
q mr president if the west germans 
a viewed with alarm 
q if the west germans refuse to modernize shortrange weapons 
will that hurt the alliance in the long run and perhaps result in 
the denuclearization of europe 
a too hypothetical a question jerry for me to answer

president bush said tuesday the federal 
government has a responsibility to help curb an increase in 
drugrelated homicides in the nations capital 
we have a responsibility as a federal city but there isnt 
any easy answer to that he said in answer to a question at a news 
conference 
i campaigned strongly on enforcing existing law on being tough 
on criminals on more prison space i think all those things will be 
caught up in our new antidrug program yes i think the federal 
government has a role in it 
he said there will be federal money and i wish we had more 
but he did not elaborate 
the district of columbia has recorded 80 homicides so far this 
year compared with 51 by feb21 a year ago the citys 372 
homicides last year set a record for the city about 80 percent of 
the deaths were drugrelated according to a study released last 
week 
bush a member of the national rifle association said last week 
he was worried about the proliferation and use of firearms in 
washington and elsewhere but still wanted to be a president who 
protected the rights of people to have arms 
he said that states should enforce existing laws and that he 
would strongly oppose any attempt to outlaw semiautomatic weapons 
its hard very hard to do but thats my position and im not 
going to change it he said in an interview with several reporters 
last wednesday 
look at the laws on gun control and youll find where some of 
the more stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are procured 
there and weapons are used there so youre not going to get me to 
do anything other than to say im very concerned about this 
the district has one of the nations toughest gun laws 
dozens of states as well as congress are considering measures 
to outlaw the manufacture sale or possession of a variety of 
semiautomatic weapons

representatives of 16 countries arrived tuesday for 
emperor hirohitos funeral and concern for the safety of visiting 
world leaders grew with the discovery of two homemade projectiles 
near tokyos airport 
the projectiles were in launchers aimed at the heavily guarded 
airport about 40 miles east of the city and apparently were 
planted by radicals opposed to fridays state funeral a police 
official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said a timer 
also was found he declined to say at what time it was set 
cargo traffic and flights through narita international airport 
and tokyos domestic airport will be restricted this week and 
32000 police have been mobilized in tokyo 
officers were stationed at checkpoints throughout the city and 
patrolled downtown neighborhoods they also have searched homes 
along the funeral route 
authorities say the massive police presence is justified by 
japans small but active radical groups and by fears that 
international terrorists could attack as visiting leader 
officials say representatives of 163 countries will attend the 
funeral 
workers on tuesday made final preparations at the funeral site in 
a tokyo park 
hirohitos son emperor akihito and empress michiko met briefly 
with finnish president mauno koivisto and his wife tellervo at the 
akasaka palace it was the royal couples first meeting with foreign 
dignitaries since hirohito died jan 7 
they are expected to meet other heads of state and visiting 
royalty during the week 
prime minister noboru takeshita is to meet with about 40 of the 
55 heads of state who plan to attend the funeral and foreign 
minister sousuke uno will meet about 90 foreign officials the 
foreign ministry says 
many of those talks will last less than half an hour but 
takeshita plans longer meetings with president bush and president 
francois mitterrand of france 
the diplomatic contacts began tuesday with a meeting between 
deputy foreign minister takakazu kuriyama and his soviet 
counterpart igor a rogachev 
they discussed plans for talks in march on a peace treaty to 
formally end world war ii hostilities and settle a longstanding 
territorial dispute involving sovietheld islands the foreign 
ministry said 
foreign officials also will meet among themselves british 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe has scheduled talks with chinese 
foreign minister qian qichen to discuss hong kongs return to 
chinese control 
many japanese proudly see the large number of countries attending 
as a sign that japan finally has been accepted internationally after 
its disastrous role in world war ii 
but there were reminders of lingering ill feelings in several 
nations including south korea china australia new zealand and 
britain there were disputes over who to send to the funeral because 
of memories of the war fought in hirohitos name 
japanese who oppose the state funeral including radicals say 
hirohito led japan into world war ii and failed to stop the 
oppressive actions of the militarist government of the time 
japans parliament adjourned monday until after the funeral 
giving takeshita a respite from criticism at home over an 
embarrassing stockprofiteering scandal that has shaken his 
governing liberal democratic party three cabinet members have 
resigned in connection with the scandal

margin 
we were very careful said sam altobello registrar of voters 
for jefferson parish in the new orleans suburb 
the official count from saturdays special election was taken to 
the courthouse where the numbers will be shipped by special courier 
to baton rouge in time for the opening of a special legislative 
session wednesday

his taking office at the outset of the session 
state rep odon bacque a freshman legislator said he plans to 
challenge the seating of duke when he is to be sworn in 
bacque the only registered independent member in the house said 
he will challenge dukes seating on grounds that duke did not live 
in the district for a year as required by law 
duke has maintained that he did live in the district and on 
sunday dismissed further questions about it as frivolous 
duke 38 defeated homebuilder john treen 63 in saturdays

president bushs journey to japan will take him 
inexorably down a path of war memories punctuated by visions of 
being shot down at sea and losing two navy buddies in combat 
but if attending emperor hirohitos funeral on friday presents a 
painful reminder of the war with japan bush isnt saying so 
im doing whats right he said recently 
bush a former navy aviator whose plane was shot down over the 
pacific by the japanese in 1944 said we have a good relationship 
with japan i want to see it even better and this doesnt concern 
me a bit and youre talking to a person who was in combat in world 
war ii i feel you look ahead not always look back you do whats 
right 
its the right thing to do 
bush visited japan twice as vice president in 1982 and 1984 
in his 1987 autobiography looking forward bush shows little 
reluctance to talk about what happened sept 2 1944 
the young navy officer and two other crew members gunnery 
officer william g ted white and radiomantailgunner jack 
delaney had taken off in a tbm avenger on a mission to knock out a 
japanese radio facility on chichi jima one of three islands in the 
bonin chain about 600 miles from tokyo 
bush described in graphic detail how his plane was blown from the 
sky and how he managed to ride a torn parachute to the water 
ultimately to be picked up by a navy rescue ship the uss finback 
as he neared the water bush wrote i looked around for delaney 
and white but the only thing in sight was my parachute drfiting 
away 
bush wrote about the letter he sent his parents six days after 
his rescue in which he described my feelings at the time 
i try to think about it as little as possible he wrote in 
the book yet i cannot get those two out of my mind i know i 
wont be able to shake the memory of this incident and i dont 
believe i want to completely 
two days before his inauguration jan 20 bush was reunited with 
about three dozen of his war buddies hosting a nostaligic party for 
surviving fellow pilots radiomen and gunners and sharing 
remembrances with them 
in a recent telephone interview from his home in rogers ark 
don kohler the submarine torpedoman who helped pull bush from his 
bobbing life raft said i think he feels the need to go there for 
the total relationship between their country and our country 
theyre a major entity in the world economy 
kohler who is 64 like bush said he shares the presidents view 
that you should forgive and forget i dont know what part 
hirohito had in running the country into war but believe me i 
think most people in japan today want to forget about the war 
kohler added i know there are other people in the united 
states who have strong feelings the other way 
former sen jeremiah denton rala who was a north vietnamese 
prisoner of war for eight years described bush as a giant of a 
man who wants to avoid showing any feeling of vindictiveness 
toward the japanese 
bush is traveling to japan with an interest in the commonality 
of humankind and with altruism toward his fellow man denton 
said in a telephone interview 
he seems to understand the japanese people and the japanese 
people understand him said denton 
denton said that while he has not returned to vietnam he 
believes that americans caught in wars seldom hold lingering 
bitterness toward the people of a nation that has warred against the 
united states 
i feel very lovingly frustrated toward the people of vietnam 
he said 
a presidential scholar at the university of virginia larry 
sabato said that bush is in the noblesse oblige tradition and 
part of noblesse oblige is sublimating oneself to the common good 
my personal feeling is that if he does have lingering 
bitterness hes suppressed it sabato said hes going to be 
busy having meetings with world leaders he really wont have that 
much time to concentrate on the personal aspect of it hell be so 
busy that i dont think hell have much time for personal 
reflection

q mr president ill ask you a japan question 
a shoot laughter 
q with the summit starting tomorrow how do you reasssure 
those americans who are afraid of japanese economic power who think 
that they are buying and are owning too much of the united states 
economy 
a i tell them that the japanese have the are the third largest 
holder of investment in the united states behind the uk and the 
netherlands 
i tell them that it is important if we believe in open markets 
that people be allowed to invest here just as id like to see more 
openness for american investors in other countries 
i tell them that we have to do a better job in knocking down 
barriers to american products in the various markets 
i tell them dont get so concerned over foreign ownership that 
you undermine the securities markets in this country 
we have horrendous deficits and foreign capital joins domestic 
capital in financing those deficits 
so i also tell them i have a responsibility as president in terms 
of our technology in terms of our national security and i intend 
to exercise that responsibility 
gerry 
q yes mr president i think what concerns some people about 
senator tower is the fact that he has admitted that he had a 
drinking problem in the 70s and he hasnt really had any kind of 
treatment program or been enrolled in any kind of treatment program 
what do you say to people about the potential of a relapse 
a i say that he that there is no evidence of any kind of the 
disease alcoholism none none whatsoever 
and that would be something that would be that your question is 
addressed to 
and id say that i looked at the reports with this in mind and i 
didnt listen to rumors 
i didnt listen to mindless allegations 
i was fair enough to look at the facts 
and ive known senator tower and known him professionally and 
known him as a friend 
and i do not think that these charges that are tried and then 
shot down and then tried again and then shot down again have 
helped the process 
and so i am not about to make a judgment on some rumor or some 
innuendo 
and weve looked at the facts 
and i think the report speaks to the fact that a lot of the 
charges most oh id say all of these charges that weve read 
about have been rumor and a lot of it vicious rumor 
and so i am convinced that he is not only capable of doing this 
job but will do it in an outstanding way 
q mr president 
a how many more have we got 
q on the budget 
a who is that voice i hear in the back 
could it be sarah mcclendon 
q no 
a well sorry its a democracy

the supreme court in a case involving alleged 
fraud in a 20yearold business merger today limited the ability of 
people to seek additional damages after winning a lawsuit 
the 90 ruling in a case from georgia restricts the ability of 
purported fraud victims to sue a leading accounting firm 
the case arose out of the 1969 merger of cavalier bag co and 
et barwick industries inc 
the owners of cavalier bag myles guykenneth and robert 
osterneck charged in a 1975 lawsuit that the financial health of 
barwick industries was overstated 
the osternecks sued barwick officials and ernst amp whinney an 
accounting firm that had prepared the allegedly inflated financial 
statements 
after nearly 10 years of pretrial maneuvering the case went to 
trial in 1984 and the barwick company and its offficials were 
ordered to pay the osternecks more than 26 million in damages plus 
946000 in interest 
but the osternecks lost their case against ernst amp whinney 
they then appealed seeking to revive the case against the 
accounting firm that appeal was filed at the same time that the 
osternecks request for interest payments against the barwick 
officials was pending in court 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled that the osternecks 
bid for damages against the accounting firm must be treated as a 
motion to amend the original judgment that the osternecks had won 
therefore the appeals court barred the osternecks from pursuing 
a separate appeal against ernst amp whinney while at the same time 
they were seeking additional interest payments against the barwick 
officials 
the supreme court today upheld the appeals court ruling 
justice anthony m kennedy writing for the court said handling 
appeals in this manner helps avoid piecemeal appellate court review 
of lower court judgments 
the case is osterneck vs ernst amp whinney 871201

a unanimous supreme court today gave lawyers 
added incentive the possibility of biggerthanbargainedfor legal 
fees to represent those who claim their civil rights were violated 
the court ruled in a louisiana case that the losing side in some 
civil rights lawsuits may be forced to pay the winning sides 
lawyers more than the lawyers originally had sought 
the normal rule in us courts is that each side pays its own 
lawyers but congress has altered that rule in about 200 
feeshifting laws and allowed the winning side to collect its 
lawyer fees from the losing side 
most notably such fee awards are available to people who 
successfully sue over civil rights violations 
arthur j blanchard who said he was assaulted without 
provocation by a st martin parish sheriffs deputy james bergeron 
was awarded 10000 in damages by a federal jury 
the presiding judge also awarded blanchard 7500 in lawyer fees 
which bergeron was ordered to pay 
but the 5th us circuit court of appeals reduced the lawyerfee 
award to 4000 after noting that blanchard and his lawyer had a 
contingencyfee agreement in which the lawyer was to get 40 percent 
of any damage award 
the appeals court said the 40 percent contingency agreement 
effectively placed a cap on any lawyerfee award that could be made 
writing for the supreme court today justice byron r white said 
no such cap exists 
if a contingent fee agreement were to govern as a strict 
limitation on the award of attorneys fees an undesirable emphasis 
might be placed on the importance of the recovery of damages in 
civil rights litigation white said 
the intention of congress he said was to encourage 
successful civil rights litigation not to create a special 
incentive to prove damages and shortchange efforts to seek effective 
injunctive or declaratory relief 
the justices told the 5th circuit court to reconsider its 
lawyerfee award ruling in blanchards case 
the case is blanchard vs bergeron 871485

that mr rogers is one honest adult 
that at least is what fred rogers says he wants to give the 
kids who watch his tv program 
thats what i long for them to have as many honest adults in 
their lives as possible he said in an interview with parents 
magazine 
the host of mr rogers neighborhood said the slick look and 
frantic pace of many shows baffle him 
all i know is that im offering myself as i am and as i do 
what im creating is not something false to me he explained 
and there must be those who feel that their truth is in this kind 
of mayhem 
what i believe and hope comes through on the program is that 
each person is unique that each person is valuable and that each

president bush met with congressional leaders 
today in an effort to propel budget talks forward but a top house 
budget writer said details on tough choices were still missing 
rep leon e panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said the hourlong breakfast session at the white house 
dealt more with process than with details of the 116 trillion 
spending plan 
it was important for us to emphasize were on the right track 
and we are panetta told reporters after the meeting 
but he added when does he bush start to make the tough 
choices thats part of the process here to find out what the 
choices are 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said the meeting 
was not a discussion about details but an effort to discuss 
how we might proceed in the future to discuss the process 
the session included democratic and republican leaders from both 
houses as well as heads of the congressional budget appropriations 
and taxwriting committees 
seated at the center of one side of the long rectangular table in 
the cabinet room the president refused to answer reporters 
questions during a brief phototaking session 
bush has vowed to be an active player in shaping spending cuts 
needed to get the governments annual budget deficit under the 100 
billion required by law for the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 
congress faces an april 15 deadline for completion of its version 
of the budget 
bushs participation in the budgetwriting process is unusual in 
that it comes less than two weeks after he submitted his proposed 
116 trillion spending plan before any votes on spending decisions 
have been held by committees in either chamber 
its a ratchetingup of the process presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said in advance of todays meeting 
its purpose is to keep the momentum going said fitzwater 
noting that it was bushs first meeting with congressional leaders 
since the presidents address to a joint housesenate session nearly 
two weeks ago 
fitzwater said bush hopes discussions will continue during his 
absence but that talk has not yet reached the negotiating stage 
id say its in the consultation and discussion stage he said 
white house budget director richard darman meanwhile opened two 
days of testimony before the senate and house budget committees with 
a defense of bushs spending plan as realistic leaving the details 
of spending cuts for future negotiations was acknowledging where 
those decisions would be made he said 
but democrats on the senate budget committee said they saw it as 
a political ploy 
i just dont see this as a serious initiative said sen 
ernest f hollings dsc where are the cuts going to come 
from said committee chairman jim sasser dtenn we just dont 
know from looking at the bush budget 
democrats say bush listed politically popular initiatives on 
child care education and homelessness but did not list the 
approximately 10 billion in cuts that must be made in other 
programs to pay for the increases leaving those unpopular choices 
to share with congress 
fitzwater counters that some 800 pages of details have been 
made available to congress in addition to the 193page budget 
document that bush submitted on feb 9 
they contain a number of policy options he said but not 
necessarily specific cuts a number of various options 
when pressed monday to say whether bush had recommended budget 
reductions in specific areas fitzwater replied cuts that the 
group might consider 
indeed papers obtained by the associated press show the 
administration avoided in those documents putting its stamp on any 
particular set of cuts options listed included adoption of former 
president reagans budget choices or freezing programs at last 
years levels without allowing for inflation 
blank spaces were left for final decisions presumably to be 
worked out in negotiations with congress 
the documents also suggest that the definition of a flexible 
freeze is itself flexible and still being developed 
the bush budget released feb 9 defined the freeze as a package 
of 136 billion in domestic programs held at this years spending 
levels without inflation some of those could be increased but 
only if others were decreased to keep the total the same 
the papers sent to congress last week showed the 136 billion 
included a small piece of the defense budget about 6 billion 
earmarked for programs such as atomic research 
bush made three outoftown speeches on his fiscal 1990 budget 
proposal last week capping the appearances with a declaration in 
st louis last friday that he wanted a quick and early resolution 
to the budget crisis 
i am committed to working closely with my friends on the hill 
to help them meet the target date set by the grammrudmanhollings 
law for an april 15 budget resolution he said 
that law which requires a balanced budget by 1993 calls for a 
deficit in the fiscal year that begins oct 1 of no more than 100 
billion down from an estimated 160 billion this year failure by 
congress and the administration to meet that target could result in 
automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
in the proposal he submitted which was intended to amend the 
fiscal 1990 budget offered by reagan in january bush said he wanted 
to increase spending in a number of social areas 
but democrats have been pushing him to spell out where he would 
make 10 billion to 11 billion in necessary cuts to pay for the 
emphasis he wants to give certain programs especially in view of 
bushs notaxincrease pledge 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine suggested monday 
that democrats will have their own agenda 
talking to reporters covering the aflcio executive council 
meeting in bal harbour fla mitchell said for example that it 
was his intention to schedule early floor debate on legislation to 
increase the minimum wage which has been frozen at 335 an hour 
since 1981 
mitchell said the democrats bill would not contain a subminimum 
youth training wage that bush has proposed but the maine democrat 
said it was possible the bill would be amended on the floor

q i want to ask you about gun control all over the country 
a who 
q the parents and the people now dont leave me dont 
leave me laughter 
a sarah 
q all over the country the parents now are going to city hall 
about this in cleveland they just had a vote the polls are being 
taken mothers are up in arms about this something is going to have 
to be done about stopping guns and you say youre for them 
a for what 
q thats what you said the other day that you were not going to 
stop be for the ban on gun control 
a id like to find some way to do something about these 
automated weapons 
id like to see some way to enforce the laws that are already in 
the books about automated ak47s coming into this country 
and id like to find a way to be supportive of the police who are 
out there on the line all the time and maybe there is some answer 
to it 
but i also want to have be the president that protects the 
rights of people to have arms 
and that 
q inaudible 
a so you dont go so far that the legitimate rights on some 
legislation are you know impinged on 
q sir thats what we said last year but now 
a sarah look at the laws on gun control and you find where some 
of the most stringent gun control laws exist that weapons are 
procured there and weapons are used there 
so youre not going to get me to do anything other than to say 
look im very concerned about this id like to find a way to do 
something about this and were going to take a hard look to see 
what we can do about it if anything that would be helpful 
but whenever there is a crime involving a firearm there are 
various groups some of them quite persuasive in their logic that 
think you can ban certain kinds of guns and i am not in the mode 
i am in the mode of being deeply concerned and would like to be a 
part of finding a national answer to this problem 
now weve got time for one more right in the middle you can 
fight about it laughs 
q speaking of rights i want to ask if it disturbs you at all 
the american booksellers were forced to take mr rushdies book 
intimidated into taking mr rushdies book off the shelves and if 
youd given any thought to some sort of federal protection to help 
them defend the 
a the answer is yes and federal protection would be to enforce 
the laws that exist against people doing violence and of course 
im concerned about that 
who wouldnt be 
owen gets the followup and them im leaving 
q budget question 
a i know theres an overwhelming owen has got the last 
question and i get the last word laughter

a judge today recommended that amoco corp be 
ordered to pay about 115 million to france and nearly 90 french 
citizens or businesses damaged by millions of gallons of oil spilled 
in a 1978 supertanker accident 
retired us district judge frank mcgarr sitting as a special 
master recommended an increase of about 30 million in his original 
852 million judgment against the oil company 
us district judge charles norgle will enter a final judgment 
virtually all parties to the case had asked mcgarr to reconsider 
his january 1988 decision issued before his retirement as a federal 
judge 
amoco and the french plaintiffs immediately indicated they were 
likely to appeal todays ruling 
a lot of people wont be happy the recommendation is a mixed 
bag but the oyster growers for one will be pleased theyre in 
line for the biggest revision said attorney warren marwedel who 
represented a number of oyster syndicates two french regions and a 
number of other plaintiffs affected by the spill from the amoco 
cadiz supertanker 
its a very conservative traditional opinion marwedel said 
things like the loss of enjoyment and environmental claims were 
not given the consideration we had sought 
amoco attorney franck cicero said the company was pleased with 
mcgarrs recommendation 
if you look at the total awarded so far theyve only got about 
3 percent of what they originally claimed cicero said the 
judge indicated again he thought they were overreaching and there 
were some duplicate claims 
cicero said amoco is proceeding with litigation against the 
spanish builder of the amoco cadiz astilleros espanoles sa 
the amoco cadiz ran aground two miles off the brittany coast 
march 16 1978 the huge tanker which had lost the use of its 
rudder had been under tow through the english channel by a 
germanowned tug when the towlines snapped in hurricaneforce winds 
and heavy seas 
the liberianregistered supertanker carried 223000 tons or 68 
million gallons of mostly iranian light crude oil valued at 24 
million the spill the largest ever from a tanker caused an oil 
slick more than 10 miles across and 80 miles long 
the plaintiffs include more than 90 villages from frances 
brittany coast groups of oystermen and fishermen property owners 
and environmentalists they had initially sought more than 11 
billion in damages

anglers who find nothing appealing about the 
great outdoors when their catch comes up short will be able to tip 
the scales in their favor with a new device fax machines 
beginning in may fishermen on lake michigan will be able to use 
fax machines to receive the latest weather satellite maps 
the maps will tell where the cold water meets warm water which 
is where steelhead trout swim said allen miller a spokesman for 
the project of the sea grant institute at the university of 
wisconsinmadison 
the change in temperatures and water coming up from lower 
depths tends to concentrate bait fish and insects which in turn 
attracts the trout miller said 
satellites send information including the surface water 
temperature to a receiver in wallops island va the information is 
relayed to the university by another satellite

the campus may be dull and brown these 
days but 60 tons of manmade snow will give prospective students a 
different view of williams college 
because of a snowless winter in the berkshires the college 
monday trucked in the snow for photographs for a williams 
promotional brochure 
were not faking anything philip f smith director of 
admissions said as workers spread the white stuff from a nearby ski 
area in front of a dormitory and the geology building we are just 
hoping to get some good winter shots 
student models posed amid the manmade drifts about 30000 copies 
of the brochure are mailed to high school students each year 
by late tuesday morning only a lump or two of the imported 
snow was left the campus was soggy under a springlike rain and 
temperatures were expected to reach the unseasonable 50s said 
spokeswoman ellen barek 
the northern berkshire mountains which normally receive 50 to 55 
inches of snow by this time of year have received only about 18 
inches said john hockridge of the new england weather associates 
office in nearby north adams 
we only get to redo this brochure once every five years said 
james kolesar of the colleges publicity office to have a 
brochure of williams that did not have winter shots would be very 
dishonest

a house panel was told tuesday that the nation 
should react to the greenhouse effect on global warming by using 
natural gas instead of coal and by developing safe and publicly 
acceptable nuclear power 
robert m white president of the national academy of 
engineering said these are among measures needed to prevent further 
buildup of greenhouse gases that could be responsible for global 
warming 
white and three other witnesses cautioned that scientists still 
do not know whether burning of fossil fuels and other human 
activities will cause significant temperature changes leading to 
heat waves and drought 
one witness university of virginia professor patrick j 
michaels told a house energy and commerce subcommittee it would be 
more prudent to await more study before making drastic policy 
decisions 
our policy should be commensurate with the state of our 
scientific knowledge the professor of environmental sciences told 
the energy and power subcommittee 
michaels said climate experts have a clouded vision of future 
global warming and added basing sweeping environmental policy 
on such uncertainties is especially risky even if the policy is 
otherwise rational 
the greenhouse effect occurs when gases in earths atmosphere 
trap radiant heat near the planets surface the more gases the 
more heat 
the gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they 
are to outgoing infrared energy 
in addition to natural buildup greenhouse gases have increased 
because of human activities including burning of fossil fuels 
coal oil and gas and destruction of tropical rain forests 
the problem comes in trying to predict what will happen in the 
future projections are now made by scientists using mathematical 
models that are only approximations of the real atmosphere 
white told the panel not to wait for more study to take action 
suggesting we can intervene through more efficient use of fossil 
fuels and incentives to use those that contribute least to the 
carbon dioxide building per thermal unit 
for example shifts from coal to natural gas as well as 
intensified efforts to develop nofossil energy sources such as 
passively safe and publicly acceptable nuclear power are desirable 
we can work with other nations to reduce tropical 
deforestation these actions should slow the climate warming 
dr stephen schneider a scientist for the national center for 
atmospheric research in boulder colo agreed with white that 
action was needed now as insurance against catastrophic change 
its a question of what kind of risks do you want to take with 
the planet he said 
dr daniel l albritton of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration said even after more is learned about the greenhouse 
effect on global warming lawmakers still might not be able to learn 
how the trend would affect their own regions 
the national academy of engineering is a private organization 
created by the national academy of sciences

a judge ruled tuesday that the jurors 
selected to try mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and eight 
associates in a 1985 rubout will be sequestered but their names 
will not be kept secret 
the 59yearold scarfo and his codefendants are accused of 
plotting and carrying out the slaying of frank frankie flowers 
dalfonso who was gunned down on a street near his home 
detectives said dalfonso had showed disrespect to scarfo by 
joining a rival mob faction 
scarfo could be sentenced to death if convicted 
he was convicted last year in a federal racketeering conspiracy 
case of running the philadelphiasouth jersey mafia from his 
atlantic city home 
assistant district attorney charles grant on tuesday sought to 
have the names and addresses of all prospective jurors kept 
anonymous but common pleas judge eugene clark refused 
he found no evidence that jurors would be threatened if their 
identity was known said michael pinsky an attorney for one of 
scarfos codefendants 
the judge ruled however that the 12 jurors and six alternates 
when chosen will be sequestered in a hotel jury selection is 
expected to take two weeks 
scarfo has been in jail since 1987 and is serving a 14year 
sentence for conspiring to extort 1 million from a developer he 
was acquitted in may of ordering the assassination of a rival and 
awaits sentencing in the racketeering case

here ataglance are highlights of the major 
actions taken tuesday by the supreme court 
 
pornography 
the court ruled that states may use antiracketeering laws to 
fight pornography but invoked freespeech rights to ban the states 
from seizing before trial the contents of adult bookstores 
the justices said authorities unlawfully seized the contents of a 
fort wayne ind bookstore before any materials in the store were 
judged obscene at a trial 
but by a 63 vote the justices said prosecutors still may use 
the states antiracketeering law to renew the obscenity case 
the cases are fort wayne books vs indiana 87470 and 
sappenfield vs indiana 87614 
 
religious books 
 
the court ruled that states may not give preferential treatment 
to religious ublications by exempting them from sales taxes imposed 
on other books newspapers and magazines 
by a 63 vote the justices said a nowdefunct texas statute 
violated the constitution the decision presumably will force the 
state to give sales tax refunds to nonreligious publications or 
impose the levy against religious organizations that were exempt 
the case is texas monthly vs bullock 871245 
 
summary trials 
 
the court let stand rulings that the public has no right to 
attend the socalled summary jury trials held in some legal 
disputes 
the justices without comment rejected arguments by newspapers 
in three ohio cities that trial judges should be barred from 
conducting such proceedings in secret

first time that the constitution provides a public right of access 
to judicial proceedings in civil or noncriminal cases 
the case is cincinnati post vs ge 88813 
 
evangelists 
 
television evangelist jimmy swaggart failed in his bid to kill a 
90 million lawsuit by a defrocked evangelist who swaggart accused 
of adultery in 1986 
the court without comment rejected arguments that marvin 
gormans suit against swaggart and others unconstitutionally 
entangles louisiana state courts in matters of church doctrine and 
discipline 
the cases are swaggart vs adler 881080 and treeby vs gorman 
881058 
 
freedom of expression 
 
the court refused to reinstate the pandering conviction of a 
hollywood movie producer who hired actors to peform sex acts in a

freeman 881050 
 
abortion

appeals court rules on its constitutionality 
the case is eubanks vs wilkinson a582 
 
iran assets 
 
the court agreed to referee a dispute between the us government

irans death sentence on novelist salman rushdie 
has appalled european intellectuals and stung them into a concerted 
protest that appears to be spreading throughout the nonmoslem world 
we find ourselves caught up in a religious war edward 
mortimer a british commentator wrote tuesday 
in london authors and free speech advocates announced they would 
seek support for a world statement to be published in newspapers 
internationally 
expressions of disgust came from mexican novelist octavio paz and 
the australian government american writers led by pen american 
center president susan sontag also have begun mobilizing and 
president bush added his condemnation tuesday 
rushdies novel the satanic verses has been judged 
blasphemous by moslems because of its treatment of the prophet 
mohammed and the koran islams holy book 
moslem protests began in britain soon after the novels 
publication last fall but their demonstrations and public 
bookburnings were widely regarded as more as a curiosity than as a 
threat 
then came last weeks riots in pakistan and india that claimed at 
least six lives followed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death 
sentence on rushdie and his publishers 
almost immediately british playwright harold pinter led a group 
of writers to prime minister margaret thatchers doorstep to demand 
action over an intolerable and barbaric state of affairs 
the british governments initial tactic apparently was to wait 
and see whether an apology from rushdie might lift the death threat 
rushdie who had gone into hiding issued an apology saturday for 
causing offense to islam when that had no effect the government 
decided with its european economic community partners to get tough 
on monday the 12 eec countries resolved to withdraw their envoys 
from iran noneec countries also took action sweden recalled its 
ambassador and the austrian swiss and finnish governments summoned 
iranian diplomats to express their condemnation 
in france the affair has dominated the headlines patrick 
marnham a british writer and journalist in paris believes french 
intellectuals have responded much more vigorously than their british 
counterparts would have done if a french writer was under threat 
theyre really outraged he said in an interview 
after the books french publisher suspended publication to 
protect its employees from khomeinis retribution the weekly 
levenement du jeudi proposed that french publishers put the book 
out en masse and share responsibility nearly 20 publications and 
publishing houses said they would participate 
more than 500 authors belonging to the french section of the 
international pen club wrote to prime minister michel rocard 
demanding action to ensure the book was published 
in west germany writer hans magnus enzensberger said a group of 
authors including internationally renowned guenter grass had 
agreed to explore ways of publishing the satanic verses after 
its german publisher pulled out 
several dutch newspapers and weeklies are to publish an ad signed 
by some 850 intellectuals supporting rushdie and dutch foreign 
minister hans van den broek has canceled a visit to iran 
the irish writers union wrote to the irish times saying irelands 
own history of religious censorship should rally its writers to 
rushdies defense 
spanish novelist juan benet called the death threat savagery 
and the madrid newspaper el pais quoted octavio paz as saying it 
seems incredible to me that in the 20th century a writer could be 
sentenced to death for writing whatever he chooses 
the norwegian and danish authors unions said they deplored the 
death threat and publishers in those countries said they would go 
ahead with translations 
italian novelist alberto moravia denounced the death threat on 
television while in overwhelmingly moslem turkey novelist orhan 
pamuk published a newspaper article defending rushdies right to 
free speech 
if there is one thing that insults the islamic countries it is 
the decision to announce a bounty for the muirder of the authors of 
other countries and assign murderers to kill them he wrote 
mortimer writing in the financial times said the real lesson of 
the affair was its global nature pitting western concepts of 
freedom against islamic fundamentalism 
britain is no longer an island he wrote nor is europe for 
that matter and nor is north america

president bush condemned irans death decree 
against british novelist salman rushdie as deeply offensive to the 
norm of civilized behavior and warned on tuesday that tehran would 
be held accountable for any actions against american interests 
bush said he strongly supports the decision of european 
governments to recall their ambassadors and chief diplomats from 
iran in protest of ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis order for the 
assassination of rushdie the author of the satanic verses a 
novel that many moslems consider blasphemous 
on another matter bush said he was not concerned that soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadzes diplomatic trip to the middle 
east would diminish the us role in the region 
asked what role moscow should play in the middle east bush said 
emphatically i think it should be a limited role and i think 
thats what its going to be 
bush said he would not send somebody charging off on a mission 
to counter mr shevardnadzes trip 
the president made his comments at a hurriedly called news 
conference at the white house on the eve of his departure for a 
fiveday asian trip to attend the funeral of emperor hirohito in 
japan followed by stops in china and south korea 
bush used the opportunity to urge the senate to move 
forthrightly to approve the embattled nomination of john tower as 
secretary of defense after repeated allegations of womanizing 
excessive drinking and questions about towers relationship with 
defense contractors 
bush said the allegations amounted to very unfair treatment of 
this man by rumor and innuendo over and over again the president 
said a new fbi report released monday gunned down the 
allegations of misconduct 
saying tower will be a good secretary of defense bush declared 
ive never wavered in my support for john tower 
up until now bush has been silent on the worldwide controversy 
over the ayatollahs death threat against rushdie an indianborn 
british citizen who now is hiding under police protection 
many moslems say rushdies book portrays the prophet mohammeds 
wives as prostitutes and suggests that he rather than god wrote 
the koran islams holy book 
bush said that however offensive that book may be inciting 
murder and offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply 
offensive to the norm of civilized behavior 
in the light of irans incitement should any action be taken 
against american interests the government of iran can expect to be 
held accountable the president added 
asked if he hoped european nations impose economic sanctions 
against iran as the united states did years ago they will be 
discussing that im sure but i dont know where we go from there 
a number of booksellers including some of the nations largest 
chains have taken the satanic verses off the shelves bush said 
that stores should have protection of the law if they decide to go 
ahead and sell a book of this nature 
he said we are in an open society none of us like everything 
thats written 
meeting in brussels on monday the 12 foreign ministers of the 
european community nations decided to withdraw diplomatic 
representatives from iran on tuesday iran announced it was 
withdrawing its diplomats from european nations 
bush called the press conference to announce that secondterm 
rep bill grant of florida was switching his registration from 
democratic to republican 
this is good news for our party not only in florida not only 
in the south but nationally bush said 
asked his views about another republican former ku klux klan 
leader david duke who was elected to a seat in the louisiana house 
of representatives bush said his own attempt to keep duke from 
winning may have been viewed by some voters as improper or 
overkill 
however bush said dukes record is one of racism and bigotry 
and im sorry i just felt i had to speak out 
on other topics bush 
said id like to find some way to do something about easy 
access to automatic weapons but the president a strong opponent of 
gun control added that i want to be the president that protects 
the rights of people to have arms 
tried to allay some fears that the japanese own too much 
american property it is important if we believe in open markets 
that people be allowed to invest here just as id like to see more 
openness for american investors in other countries we have to 
do a better job of knocking down barriers to american products 
overseas he said 
declared im not ruling anything in or out on star wars the 
planned defense shield against nuclear missiles asked about budget 
aide richard darmans statement that further star wars development 
was conditional on the outcome of a 90day review bush said im 
not going to close any doors or open any were going to have to 
make some tough choices lets wait and see what the review 
produces

the government freed 50 
detainees tuesday after a hunger strike in two prisons was halted 
but at least 226 detainees still are fasting elsewhere police and 
lawyers said 
police said they have hospitalized 20 of the hunger strikers who 
are demanding they be freed or put on trial many have been held 
without charge for more than two years 
law and order minister adriaan vlok told parliament he signed 
release warrants for 50 detainees 
he said the hunger strikes were orchestrated outside prisons by 
opposition groups seeking to discredit the south african 
government 
inside the prisons it is the work of a small group of 
ringleaders hardened leftist activists who by means of cruel 
intimidation control the group to such a degree that many detainees 
are too afraid to break away vlok said 
veteran antiapartheid legislator helen suzman said detainees 
decided on their extremely dangerous course only after 
exhausting all avenues for airing their grievances 
by what criteria does the minister vlok decide that people 
must be kept away from the community she asked he should not 
be worried about saving face he should be worried about saving 
lives 
hunger strikes continued in the southern cities of durban 
pietermaritzburg and east london 
police said 20 hunger strikers in east london were hospitalized 
monday four days after they began fasting with six fellow detainees 
civil rights lawyers said at least 200 detainees in durban and 
pietermaritzburg have begun hunger strikes in the past two weeks 
vlok has agreed to meet lawyers for these detainees but no date has 
been set 
the first hunger strike started jan 23 and involved nearly 300 
detainees held without charge in port elizabeth and at diepkloof 
prison outside johannesburg that strike was suspended last week 
when vlok promised to review detainees cases and release a 
substantial number 
eight detainees were freed friday 
vlok has been commended even by antigovernment leaders for 
agreeing to meet lawyers parents and clergymen representing the 
hunger strikers 
however antiapartheid leader rev frank chikane said monday 
some detainees who recently quit their hunger strike could resume if 
they are dissatisfied by the number of releases in the next two 
weeks 
under the 32month state of emergency police can arrest anyone 
they believe might endanger public safety vlok decides 
periodically based on reports from police officers whether the 
detainee should remain incarcerated 
monitoring groups have said more than 30000 people mostly 
blacks have been detained for some period of time during the 
emergency vlok has never given a total figure but he said earlier 
this month there were fewer than 1000 people in detention 
on tuesday he said no youths under 16 were in detention he said 
there were 22 detainees who were 16 years old and 30 who were 17

archbishop helder camara has turned 
80 an age at which many clergymen slip quietly into retirement but 
the human rights crusader of the 1960s and 1970s remains an 
outspoken defender of the poor at the request of pope john paul ii 
following the popes instructions i will not hang up my 
spikes the roman catholic leader said 
in accordance with church rules camara known worldwide as dom 
helder the portuguese title for the high clergy had to retire at 
75 as archbishop of recife and olinda on brazils northeast coast 
but maintained his title 
im as busy now as i ever was said the short slight 
prelate seeming even smaller in a voluminous khaki cassock adorned 
with a simple wooden cross the interview came amid a heavy schedule 
of speeches and celebrations marking his 80th birthday feb 7 
during a rightwing military regime in the worlds largest 
catholic nation from 1964 to 1985 camara denounced torture and 
human rights abuses in the face of death threats and a machinegun 
attack on his parish house 
the generals branded camara the red bishop and banned his 
name from news broadcasts his supporters nominated him for the 
nobel peace prize 
those dark days have ended but brazils chronic poverty persists 
with the collusion of powerful economic interests he says 
the forces behind these conditions are wellknown large 
multinational corporations create great problems here he said 
the multinationals have very different attitudes in their own 
countries from those they have in ours 
in 25 years as archbishop camara has condemned the 
exploitation of the third world by the industrialized nations 
he also has criticized communist powers for imposing their will on 
smaller countries but reserves his harshest words for his main 
cause these days land reform 
its a scandal he said how can 20 percent of the people 
own 80 percent of the land in a country 34 times the size of 
germany 
since 1980 more than 1000 people mostly landless peasants 
have been killed in brazil in rural property disputes 
the church supports land reform but it doesnt intend to be 
political no violence or radicalization the archbishop said 
asked if he agreed with progressive clergymen who endorse land 
invasions by the homeless camara paused this business of 
invasions is funny he said i laugh when these big landowners 
say my land was invaded where did they get it wasnt that an 
invasion 
camara said the pope also is very well informed about the 
land reform issue he thinks its now possible to end this 
scandal he said 
although the pope has emphatically told priests to stay out of 
politics and has punished radical brazilian theologists in 1980 he 
met in recife with camara then considered a nonperson by the 
military government 
on live nationwide and international tv john paul embraced dom 
helder and said this man is a friend of the poor he is my 
friend 
camara remembered that with emotion 
the pope is greater than many people think he said he is 
as great as john xxiii that pontiff who reigned from 195863 
was widely known for his warm human character 
the archbishop said he is not discouraged by the immense social 
problems in this country of 144 million where modern skyscrapers 
exist sidebyside with miserable shantytowns and where the world 
bank says the income distribution between the rich and the poor is 
the most unfair in the world 
one thing i learned from young people when the problems are 
absurd the solutions become a passion he said

president idris banna and the fivemember supreme council will 
represent him at the funeral the statement said 
another newspaper aladwa said khalils letter of resignation 
charged the foreign policy adopted by the government does not lead 
to a unified internal front nor to stability and has also led to 
the isolation of the country both in the arab and outside world 
it said government policies have weakened the countrys ability 
to acquire military and economic assistance 
the united states has urged an end to the nearly 6yearold civil 
war and said it would try to promote a peace settlement washington 
has linked further us aid to ending the war and other friendly 
western and arab donors say there is an urgent need to end the 
fighting 
john garang the useducated renegade colonel who leads the 
sudan peoples liberation army signed a peace plan nov 16 with

governing coalition of mahdis umma party and the national islamic 
front of moslem fundamentalist hassan turabi

president bush said tuesday he would not be 
rushed by highprofile soviet diplomacy into framing a new us 
policy to deal with the arabisraeli confict 
he said the soviets should play only a secondary role in the 
region and i think thats what its going to be 
i dont worry about a trip by mr shevardnadze to the middle 
east bush said at a white house news conference i have no 
worry about that 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze is in the area for 
talks with arab leaders and also moshe arens the israeli foreign 
minister the session with arens in cairo is widely interpreted as a 
bid by moscow for a larger role in trying to set up mideast peace 
talks 
bush and james a baker iii the us secretary of state are 
pondering their moves after a month in office during a tour of nato 
capitals last week british spanish and dutch leaders among others 
urged baker to take advantage of what they perceived to be 
moderation by the palestine liberation organization 
baker told them he would have us diplomats explore the 
situation in the area and that he would report back to the western 
europeans at the opening of arms control negotiations between the 
north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact in vienna 
early next month 
at bushs news conference when the president was told by one 
questioner there was a perception he did not have a foreign policy 
he said ive never heard such an outrageous hypothesis 
in fact bush said we have a foreign policy in which 
eastwest relations south america and the middle east are all under 
review 
he said shevardnadzes trip which involves the first visit by a 
highlevel soviet official to egypt in 17 years doesnt trouble 
me one bit 
besides bush said he would have an opportunity to discuss a 
lot of things with other nations leaders on his own trip with 
baker to tokyo for the funeral of emperor hirohito of japan 
bush and baker are expected to meet with king hussein of jordan 
president hosni mubarak of egypt and president chaim herzog of 
israel while they are in tokyo 
the president said his policy was meant to encourage 
discussions between hussein and israel and to build on the 
progress that has been made already 
at the same time bush said the plo had advocated very useful 
changes apparently he was referring to chairman yasser arafats 
declaration last year that he accepted israels right to exist and 
had renounced terrorism 
the question is what specific steps we take next bush said 
and i dont want to be rushing out because mr shevardnadze went 
to the middle east id like to have for the first step we take of 
that nature to be a prudent step 
the president added i dont want to be stampeded by the fact 
that the soviet foreign minister takes a trip to the middle east 
in the past the soviets have backed radical arabs and kept their 
distance from israel with whom they broke relations after the 1967 
middle east war 
shevardnadzes meeting with arens on wednesday could step up a 
resumption of diplomatic ties while his stop in cairo where he will 
also see arafat separately on wednesday suggests support for egypt 
and mainstream arab positions 
and yet bush said the role of the soviets in mideast diplomacy 
should be a limited role and i think thats what its going to 
be and thats exactly the way it should be and i think the 
people in the middle east feel that way but the fact that he goes 
there really shouldnt be bad

law enforcement officers from around the 
country tuesday met to analyze what ted bundy said before his 
execution and determine which victims can be tied to the serial 
killer 
the fbi is holding the weeklong conference of about 20 law 
enforcement officers at its national center for the analysis of 
violent crime 
there are a lot of people out there a lot of agents who have 
wondered if bundy has committed crimes in their area fbi 
spokeswoman kathy bradford said theyve done them before on other 
serial killer cases because they serial killers have a tendency to 
move around the country 
its just a matter of sifting through the facts and seeing what 
we can come up with 
the goal is to learn as much as possible about bundy so other 
convicted killers present or future cannot file appeals attempting 
to shift guilt for their crimes onto bundy said florida deputy 
attorney general jim york 
i sure dont want a bunch of spurious appeals trying to blame 
everything in the world on bundy he said 
ms bradford said details of the closeddoor conference will be 
annouced friday or monday 
bundy was executed in florida last month for the murder of a 
schoolgirl 
the former law student maintained his innocence during 10 years 
on death row but as his appeals ran out and his execution date 
neared he confessed to at least 23 slayings in washington state 
colorado utah and florida 
in some instances bundy implicated himself in slayings in which 
he had not been a suspect or ones that investigators were unable to 
match to any known killings 
some law enforcement experts claim bundy may have been involved 
in 100 or more slayings of young women in oregon idaho vermont 
new jersey and pennsylvania 
agents will try to establish bundys movements from the time he 
reached puberty in washington until his arrest in florida the fbi 
said 
defense attorneys had asked the governor of florida to delay 
bundys execution to give him time to tell more about unsolved 
slayings the appeal was denied

playwright vaclav havel whose 
works are performed to acclaim abroad but banned in his homeland 
has become a symbol of resistance to czechoslovakias communist 
authorities 
on tuesday havel was convicted of participating in a banned 
rally and sentenced to nine months in prison it was the latest 
government move against the countrys bestknown dissident since the 
1950s 
books with the lined face of the blond mustachioed writer are 
not found in czechoslovak libraries or bookshops but havels 
outspoken human rights statements have brought him admiration beyond 
his works 
what is encouraging is that the young people know him his 
brother ivan said in an interview this week at the prague flat the 
two share with their wives this is paradoxical whatever happens 
bad to him whatever happens good to him everything only increases 
his popularity 
when the 52yearold havel was invited on stage at a folk music 
festival in september 5000 people cheered 
when the authorities surprisingly allowed an independent 
demonstration in prague on dec 10 crowds chanted long live 
havel before he could speak 
about 100 sympathizers gave the same chant tuesday when havel was 
led to court and more than 2000 czechoslovak intellectuals 
including communist party members had signed petitions for havels 
release 
born oct 5 1936 the son of a civil engineer who built several 
famous prague landmarks he first encountered difficulties with 
authorities in the 1950s when his bourgeois background barred him 
from university studies 
between 1963 and 1968 in a flowering of czechoslovak culture 
that produced many wellknown films and writers havel had three 
plays performed in prague 
but after the sovietled invasion of 1968 havel was among dozens 
of writers whose works were banned in their homeland 
a critical open letter to communist leader gustav husak in 1975 
and his part in founding the charter 77 human rights movement in 
1977 led to almost constant harassment and detention 
in the letter to husak havel accused the communist authorities 
of creating a bureaucratic order of grey monotony that stifles all 
individuality 
true enough the country is calm havel wrote then calm as 
a morgue or as a grave wouldnt you say 
in 1979 when havel was convicted for sedition and sentenced to 
four years in prison nobody in czechoslovakia spoke up for him 
but he already was wellknown in the west where he received 
numerous awards and his plays drew critical praise 
in giving havel the erasmus prize in 1986 the rotterdambased 
erasmus foundation said he was driven by the search for truth in 
its purest form and lauded his ability to be critical of societies 
in both east and west 
havel has refused many invitations to go to the west fearing 
that would mean leaving behind his native prague and his wife of 24 
years olga last year a book of his letters from prison to olga 
havel was published in the west 
he would like to travel in eastern europe he told the associated 
press in an interview last year but i dont think they will give 
me a passport he added with a smile

a senior palestinian official urged the 
soviet union on tuesday not to restore ties with israel before 
washington and the jewish state support an international middle east 
peace conference with the plo 
yasser abedrabbo a member of the palestine liberation 
organizations ruling 15man executive committee also accused 
washington of stalling in a dialogue with the plo to gain time for 
israel to crush a 14monthold palestinian uprising in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
washington is pushing moscow into an unconditional resumption 
of ties with israel offering in return only promises of a wider 
soviet role in the middle east he said in an interview from the 
plos headquarters in tunis 
we dont believe the soviets will fall into this trap he 
said 
abedrabbo made his comments as soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze was visiting middle east capitals in a major initiative 
to break the stalemate in the middle east peace effort and assert 
moscows influence in the region 
shevardnadzes 10day fivenation tour the highestranking 
soviet mission in the region in nearly 20 years underlined moscows 
increasing credibility in arab world following its military 
withdrawal from afghanistan and its efforts to moderate the plos 
policies 
abedrabbo said plo chief yasser arafat would ask shevardnadze 
about the possible restoration of israelisoviet ties broken after 
the 1967 middle east war in a meeting wednesday in cairo 
we believe any resumption of sovietisraeli ties should be 
linked to the convening of an international conference attended by 
the plo he said 
israel and the united states have rejected plo participation in 
any such forum 
abedrabbo is also deputy leader of the marxist democratic front 
for the liberation of palestine and headed the palestinian side in 
negotiations with the united states that began in december he said 
he still has no idea when the usplo dialogue suspended after 
president bush took office last month will resume 
washington lifted its 13year ban on public dealings with the plo 
after arafat explicitly recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
us officials said the talks were suspended because the new 
adminstration wanted to review us policy in the middle east but 
abedrabbo said this was nothing but a pretext 
the reality is that washington is trying to gain time for 
israel to crush the uprising in the occupied territories so the 
pressure for a middle east peace settlement will ease 
but theyre ignoring a reality which even the israelis are 
slowly accepting that its impossible to suppress the uprising and 
return to the situation that existed before the uprising was 
launched 
at least 380 arabs and 15 israelis have been killed since the 
uprising against israeli rule began dec 8 1987 
abedrabbo repeated a statement by arafat that israeli leaders 
have made indirect contacts with the plo on peace initiatives and 
the uprising through third parties 
what theyve been saying through these third parties is 
different from their public statements he noted 
these messages are coming regularly and on a weekly basis if 
israeli leaders continue to deny that theyve been in touch with us 
then we shall be forced to uncover everything he said without 
elaboration 
israeli leaders have denied that there have been any direct or 
indirect contacts made with the plo which it regards as a terrorist 
organization

president bush and his budget director on 
tuesday prodded congressional leaders to join them in budget 
negotiations but democrats responded by chiding them for 
withholding their views on where spending cuts should be made 
talk of more talks was put on hold while with bush heading for 
japan congress began budget hearings amid efforts to extract more 
detailed information from the white house 
weve got an administration here that wants to embrace the 
concept of a lineitem veto but wont give us a lineitem budget 
said sen jim sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee 
the president met at the white house early tuesday with sasser 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and other top republicans and democrats from 
capitol hill 
it was the first such meeting since bush revealed his 116 
trillion fiscal 1990 budget in a speech to congress on feb 9 
lawmakers said they told the president that before negotiations 
could begin they needed more detail especially on how he would pay 
for the new programs he wants for education the environment child 
care and other areas 
and they said the prognosis was poor for some of the specific 
recommendations he did include such as a reduction in the capital 
gains tax rate 
bush contends cutting the rate about in half to 15 percent 
would result in more taxes being paid because economic activity 
would increase democrats not only doubt the presidents supplyside 
math but contend the tax is a giveaway to the rich since poor 
people have few capital gains 
the meeting was polite but it dealt more with schedules than 
substance participants said 
the symbolism is very good we havent really gotten down to 
substance wright said predicting that once work begins some 
serious differences will emerge on issues such as a 5 billion 
medicare cut one of the handful of spending cuts bush did detail 
it was important for us to emphasize were on the right track 
and we are said rep leon panetta dcalif the house budget 
committee chairman but panetta asked when does he start to make 
the tough choices thats part of the process here to find out what 
the choices are 
bushs budget director richard darman appearing before the 
senate budget committee defended the white house budget including 
bushs proposal for a flexible freeze on 136 billion in 
existing programs 
those programs mostly in domestic agencies would be kept at 
last years spending levels with selected increases allowed only if 
offsetting cuts were made the white house has refused to say where 
it would cut and where it would support increases 
going into further detail now had little appeal for the 
administration he said since the chances were close to zero 
that congress would agree with the administrations policy choices 
we look forward to learning of other proposals and to 
discussing them on the merits darman said we mean to be 
cooperative darman said all of the budget not just the flexible 
freeze was negotiable 
sen bennett johnston dla told him you get an a for 
mood but while thats important in congress he said agreeing on 
a budget is going to take more than a good mood 
sen ernest f hollings dsc said he thought the white house 
was trying to take political advantage and get congress to join in 
on putting something over on the public 
we cant find it cant catch it and you say come on over to 
the white house and well let you in on it he told darman whom 
he described as more jack be nimble than david stockman former 
president reagans budget director 
sen pete v domenici rnm the senior republican on the 
budget committee said he disagreed with the democrats on the need 
for fine detail 
i dont think we have to know the details but rather an overall 
view he said however he told darman it was wrong to use the 
word freeze for both pentagon spending which would increase 
with inflation and domestic programs that would be stuck at last 
years spending levels 
at another hearing before a house appropriations subcommittee 
education secretary lauro cavazos said he did not know how much 
money bush is proposing for his departments fiscal 1990 budget 
there will be no set number until after the budget negotiations with 
congress he said 
rep david obey dwis said failure to suggest ways to pay for 
441 million in new education programs sought by bush cast doubt 
over the seriousness of the proposals 
it is certainly legitimate to question whether those are in 
fact real initiatives or public relations initiatives which might 
become real at a later date he said

the company that suggested us importers 
of its american flags switch the made in taiwan label to made 
in usa said it wants nothing more to do with us protectionism 
general manager ni fengming said his company has switched to 
making national flags for canada japan west germany and australia 
after the 1987 suggestion to switch labels failed to get many us 
orders 
we stopped sales to the united states about two years ago 
because our products were strongly rejected ni fengming general 
manager of ming teh said in an interview i guess americans hate 
to see their national flag made by foreigners 
the businessman added american protectionism is really scary 
although ni says his company no longer exports american flags to 
the united states because of protectionism and the appreciation of 
the taiwan dolla both us and taiwan officials have expressed 
concern over ming tehs labelswitching suggestion 
the us customs service has ordered closer scrutiny of american 
flags from ming teh following complaints from american flag 
manufacturers and several members of the us congress 
an official at taiwans board of foreign trade said tuesday 
authorities have started an investigation to determine whether ming 
teh violated any law 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said taipei 
would take measures to discourage any labelswitching ideas 
ni stressed his company never changed the labels on its flags he 
said a salesperson suggested in june 1987 promotional letters that 
us importers remove made in taiwan tags from the companys 
halffinished exports and add a made in usa label once 
processing was completed in the united states 
ming teh dyed and printed the american flags and us companies 
did cutting and sewing according to ni 
the huge taiwan trade surplus with the united states has led to 
friction between the two countries last year the surplus was 104 
billion on total trade of 3643 billion 
mou tun an official at the china external trade development 
council said ming teh was just trying to be considerate by 
offering an alternative to us importers who wanted to buy 
taiwanmade flags but did not want to upset us flag makers

the supreme court said tuesday it will consider 
relaxing significantly the socalled exclusionary rule that bars 
from criminal trials any evidence police seized unlawfully 
the court said it will use a case from chicago to decide whether 
statements made by a criminal defendant after an unlawful arrest may 
be used by prosecutors to contradict a defense witness trial 
testimony 
the court previously has allowed prosecutors to use unlawfully 
seized evidence to contradict a defendants own trial testimony but 
the justices never before have allowed the use of such evidence to 
rebut other witnesses testimony 
the illinois supreme court by a 43 vote allowed such evidence 
to be introduced at the trial of darryl james sentenced to 30 years 
in prison for a 1982 murder 
james was 15 when arrested in his mothers beauty parlor for two 
aug 30 1982 shootings he was tried as an adult 
prosecutors said james shot and killed geliria boyd and wounded 
another youth in a latenight confrontation on a south chicago 
street 
several prosecution witnesses identified james as the triggerman 
and testified that on the night of the crime he had long 
reddishbrown hair at his trial james had short black hair 
james did not testify at his trial but two defense witnesses 
testified in his behalf one said that james had short black hair 
the night of the shootings 
prosecutors then won court permission to let a police detective 
testify that james when arrested said he had long reddishbrown 
hair the night of the crime 
the trial judge previously had ruled that james arrest was 
unlawful because police at the time did not have a court warrant or 
probable cause to suspect him of committing a crime as a result 
the police detective was not allowed to testify directly about what 
james had told him the night of the arrest 
but the detective was allowed to testify about james remarks to 
rebut the defense witness testimony 
in a related case from michigan the court said it will decide 
whether evidence obtained unlawfully after a defendant has been 
arraigned can ever be used in court 
a michigan appeals court said no and threw out tyris lemont 
harveys 1986 conviction in detroit on charges of criminal sexual 
conduct he had been sentenced to six to 10 years in prison 
the state court said harvey was entitled to a new trial because a 
police officer should not have been allowed to testify about 
comments harvey made during an unlawful police interrogation six 
days before his trial 
the testimony was not offered as part of the prosecutions case 
but only to rebut some of harveys trial testimony 
the state court acknowledged that evidence obtained in violation 
of a defendants fourth or fifth amendment rights to be free from 
unreasonable police searches and the privilege against 
selfincrimination sometimes may be used to rebut or impeach a 
defendants testimony 
but it ruled that the statement made to the police officer 
violated harveys sixth amendment right to effective legal help 
a statement so acquired may not be used for any purpose 
including impeachment the state court ruled 
the ruling was appealed by wayne county prosecutors 
the cases are james vs illinois 886075 and michigan vs 
harvey 88512

seven months after a risky escape by boat from 
vietnam to hong kong le van deng said tuesday he is ready to take 
another risk and return to his communist homeland 
i miss my parents and family the 29yearold told reporters 
who visited the argyle street holding center where he and 79 other 
vietnamese are awaiting repatriation 
they are expected to return to vietnam next month and will be the 
first group of boat people to go home voluntarily from this british 
colony which has more than 25000 vietnamese languishing in camps 
deng speaking through an interpreter said he was afraid of 
being imprisoned in vietnam but would go back anyway because he was 
homesick for his family he decided he wanted to go home a month 
after his july 17 arrival in hong kong 
other vietnamese who plan to go back also mentioned their 
families left behind 
dien tan sang 30 who fled to hong kong with his wife and three 
children said he decided to return because my parents are in 
vietnam and there is nobody to take care of them 
dien who spoke as his 4yearold son sat weeping in his lap 
said he did not know whether he would be punished when they 
returned asked if he were frightened he slowly shook his head and 
said i am not afraid 
both men said they were from the vietnamese town of quang ninh 
and that they fled to hong kong about 500 miles northeast of 
vietnam because others had done so the trips typically are made in 
overcrowded and rickety craft 
reporters previously had not been allowed to speak with the boat 
people who have agreed to return home 
only 22 boat people voluntarily returned to vietnam from hong 
kong between 1979 when nearly 70000 arrived and 1988 
but a tough new hong kong policy that no longer accepts all boat 
people as eligible for resettlement appears to have convinced some 
vietnamese to return home 
the argyle center group was issued travel documents by an 
official hanoi delegation that visited the colony this month 
they were among the more than 10000 boat people who have arrived 
since the hong kong government introduced a policy in june under 
which vietnamese face forced repatriation unless they can prove they 
fled their homeland because of persecution 
most boat people who have arrived since the new policy took 
effect wont be granted refugee status and those who are eligible 
for resettlement might have to wait years before they are accepted 
by another country 
hong kong officials have said they hope smooth repatriation of 
the first group will lead other boat people to volunteer to go home 
vietnam and the united nations signed an agreement late last year 
on the voluntary return of boat people under it hanoi agreed to 
treat returnees well and the international organization is to 
provide them with assistance

a second round of multilateral peace 
talks on cambodia ended without agreement tuesday as negotiators 
failed to bridge major differences between the warring factions 
we havent reached agreement on many points said indonesian 
foreign minister ali alatas who organized the threeday talks on 
many points further discussions will have to be done 
a statement cited differences among the four warring cambodian 
factions notably establishing an interim government 
it said participants agreed the cambodians will continue 
discussions among themselves alatas said results of those talks 
would determine when to resume multilateral discussions 
the jakarta talks were aimed at ending vietnams 10year military 
occupation of cambodia they brought together leaders of vietnam 
its ally laos the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia and 
three allied guerrilla groups opposing it the communist khmer 
rouge and noncommunist forces of sihanouk and son sann also 
participating were members of the association of southeast asian 
nations which backs the resistance brunei indonesia malaysia 
the philippines singapore and thailand 
the cambodian factions clashed throughout the talks and in more 
than one arena 
according to a thai military officer khmer rouge and cambodian 
government troops broke a lull of several weeks on the eve of the 
talks to trade heavy mortar and artillery fire saturday and sunday 
near the key thai border town of aranyaprathet the officer who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said he did not know if there were 
casualties 
at the talks the provietnamese government insisted it be 
allowed to govern while elections are held the guerrillas demanded 
the phnomh penh regime be replaced by a provisional government of 
all four factions 
how can you hold free elections in a communist state said 
sihanouks son and representative prince norodom ranariddh 
sihanouk boycotted the talks because he said his proposals already 
have been rejected 
vietnams representative foreign minister nguyen co thach was 
more upbeat telling reporters the conference has been 
successful 
vietnamese officials first met the resistance at the first 
multilateral talks in july that also was marked by bitter clashes 
but from it emerged the consensus that a withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops in cambodia must be linked to preventing a return to power by 
the khmer rouge 
on monday ranariddh said the talks had to fail because the real 
solution lay with the soviet union which arms the 5000070000 
vietnamese soldiers in cambodia and china which arms the 
guerrillas he said nothing would be achieved before the may 1518 
sinosoviet summit the first in 30 years 
both communist powers recently have softened their positions and 
declared their commitment to a negotiated cambodian settlement 
however the jakarta post newspaper tuesday quoted hun sen 
premier of the provietnamese government in cambodia as saying i 
do not believe my ally the soviet union will ever put pressure on 
me 
millions have been killed in cambodia since 1970 when a coup 
ended sihanouks 30year rule cambodia became engulfed in the 
usvietnam war and the khmer rouge regime that seized power in 
1975 killed hundreds of thousands in slave labor camps and execution 
chambers in trying to create a new agrarian society

eighty sick and wounded iraqi prisoners of 
war arrived home tuesday after being freed by iran with some 
falling to kiss the ground as they stepped off the plane 
also on tuesday a united nations official said the first 
unsponsored meeting between iraqi and iranian officers has been 
postponed indefinitely it had been scheduled for wednesday 
the 80 pows are the first of 260 sick and wounded prisoners iran 
said it would free to mark the 10th anniversary of its revolution 
earlier this month 
iraqi officials at baghdad international airport said the 
iranians informed the red cross they would repatriate 83 prisoners 
but later said three had asked for political asylum 
a senior iraqi officer speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the allswiss international committee of the red cross had informed 
them 16 of the 260 prisoners opted to stay in iran 
military police kept reporters away from the pows who all wore 
gray track suits at least 10 were in wheelchairs or carried on 
stretchers 
gini antone a doctor of the international committee of the red 
cross who accompanied them on the plane from tehran said the 
prisoners were sick but there were no serious injuries 
antone said morale was high during the 2hour flight with 
prisoners looking forward to returning home 
iraqi medical staff at the airport said the pows will be taken to 
a military hospital for more tests and will stay as long as they 
need treatment 
most returnees were taken prisoner in early days of the war 
which started in september 1980 
a jet chartered by the red cross committee carried them home 
the plane will return to tehran to bring the second batch of 
prisoners wednesday and the final group should arrive thursday said 
arnold luethold deputy director of the red cross delegation in 
baghdad 
a unsponsored ceasefire halted the war aug 20 but peace 
negotiations have stalled and an agreement to exchange prisoners in 
november collapsed over mutual recriminations of bad faith 
including the numbers requesting asylum on both sides 
the red cross has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 
19284 iranians in iraqi hands but un officials estimate they 
total 100000 
further delays to the peace process were announced by a un 
official who said the two countries cannot agree on where their 
mixed military group should meet 
they were to meet wednesday along the road between the iraqi town 
of khanaqin and the iranian border town of qasreshirin in the 
central sector of the war front and ceasefire line 
officials refused to say which country expressed reservations on 
the venue un officials are trying to negotiate a solution 
the military officers were supposed to handle issues arising from 
implementation of the ceasefire

the planned parenthood federation of america 
took aim at leaders of the prolife movement tuesday in a new 2 
million national campaign to keep abortions safe and legal 
the campaign will try to mobilize more than 1 million people to 
work at the local state and national levels on public education 
about abortion and the consequences of women losing the right to 
choose to end their pregnancy 
in addition planned parenthood is running advertisements in 
national magazines and newspapers around the country charging that 
prolife leaders oppose not just abortion but contraception and sex 
education as well 
one of the ads quotes fundamentalist jimmy swaggart as saying 
sex education classes in our public schools are promoting 
incest and randall terry a leader of the campaign to block 
abortion clinics as saying i dont think christians should use 
birth control 
the purpose of the ads is to educate americans about the tactics 
and hidden agendas of the other side said david andrews acting 
president of planned parenthood 
we believe the more the american people know about the people 
who are opposing abortion rights in america the more compassionate 
theyre going to be in supporting abortion rights he said 
the national right to life committee which claims to be the 
largest prolife organization in the country accused planned 
parenthood of using scare tactics in their ads 
theyre taking instances and blowing them out of proportion 
said leonard dinegar theyre scaring women into believing that 
anyone who is prolife is also against contraception and is in favor 
of putting women who have had abortions in jail 
dinegar said his organization takes no position on the issue of 
contraception 
but andrews insisted that abortion opponents are giving americans 
a preview of what to expect if the supreme court in its upcoming 
review of its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion allows abortion 
rights to be limited 
one need to look no further than the case of nancy and martin 
klein he said referring to the comatose new york woman whose 
husband had to fight prolife attempts to stop him from allowing 
doctors to terminate his wifes pregnancy in hopes of improving her 
chances for survival 
the millions of americans who were profoundly offended by this 
monstrous attack on a familys privacy must remember that we will 
face scores of cases like this if the supreme court weakens in any 
way the current laws regarding abortion andrews said 
in getting its message to the public planned parenthood hopes to 
catch the eyes of the supreme court justices who could severely 
limit abortion rights granted under the courts 1973 roe v wade 
decision 
they do not live in a vacuum said they are just as 
prone to read and be influenced by the media and public opinion 
polling and the force of public pressure that can be brought to bear 
on an issue like this 
a louis harris poll of 1248 randomly selected adults surveyed 
last month found that 56 percent favor retaining roe v wade while 
42 percent want the decision overturned and 68 percent oppose a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions while 29 percent are in 
favor the poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points 
part of planned parenthoods strategy is to organize republicans 
to tell president bush that in a kinder gentler america there is 
no room for backalley abortions andrews said 
make no mistake andrews said backalley abortions will 
result if the opponents of abortion succeed abortion has always 
been and will always be available even when and where it is 
illegal 
planned parenthood said it would spent 2 million from its 
national budget on the campaign and supplement that with resources 
from its 178 affiliates across the country

shevardnadzes 10day middle east initiative faces its toughest 
test wednesday when he meets israeli foreign minister moshe arens in 
an effort to sell israel on his peace plan arens warned that 
arranging peace talks could be a lengthy process 
peacemaking in the middle east is a very difficult exercise it 
is a painfully slow process but we are both convinced that very 
intensive efforts have to be made to try to put momentum in the 
process and try to move the process forward arens said 
egypts foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid speaking to 
reporters after meeting arens also indicated that preparatory moves 
might take a long time 
we will keep on discussing and talking and having a dialogue a 
means we believe in even if the dialogue takes a long time he 
said 
israel is adamantly opposed to talks with the palestine 
liberation organization which it views as a terrorist group it 
also has serious reservations about the soviet concept of an 
international conference which would include the plo 
we are trying to persuade israel to enter negotiations with 
the plo shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with egyptian 
prime minister ahmed sidqi 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir leaving on a fourday trip 
to france was chilly toward the soviet proposal of a unsponsored 
middle east peace conference 
we dont believe the international conference can serve the 
cause of peace but it was their the soviets idea so it is not 
surprising they should raise it shamir said 
he did not however rule out further discussions and israeli 
officials have hinted some compromise might ultimately be possible 
to overcome israels fears that such a conference would be biased 
against the jewish state 
on the eve of shevardnadzes meeting with arens there was rising 
speculation that it might set the stage for restoration of 
diplomatic relations between moscow and jerusalem moscow severed 
ties after the 1967 middle east war when israel captured arab lands 
arens declined to comment on the prospects for renewing ties with 
moscow but the prospect clearly alarmed plo officials 
yasser abedrabbo head of the plos information department and a 
member of the organizations 15man executive committee said the 
soviets should not renew relations unless israel accepted an 
international conference 
washington is pushing moscow into an unconditional resumption 
of ties with israel offering in return only promises of a wider 
soviet role in the middle east abedrabbo said in a telephone 
interview plo headquarters in tunis 
we dont believe the soviets will fall into this trap he 
said 
israel has insisted it would accept a soviet role in peacemaking 
only if ties are renewed 
shevardnadze was vague about what might happen concerning 
israelisoviet ties he restated moscows position that the lack of 
relations was not normal and said israel knows the means for 
bringing about a change 
the soviets have indicated they would like to see israel take a 
demonstrative step to match arafats statements in december that he 
accepted israel and renounced terror 
shevardnadze met earlier with abdelmeguid to review his 
proposal unveiled earlier in syria that the un security council 
and its five permanent members lay the groundwork for a peace 
conference to be convened within nine months the five permanent 
council members the united states the soviet union britain 
france and china would sit as a preparatory committee to arrange 
the conference 
egypt and the soviet union agreed on the importance 
convincing israel of the importance of peace withdrawal from the 
occupied territories and giving palestinians selfdetermination 
an egyptian foreign ministry official said on condition of anonymity 
shevardnadze was scheduled to meet with arafat on wednesday about 
the time that arens was flying home to israel 
we are trying to persuade israel to enter negotiations with 
the plo shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with egyptian 
prime minister ahmed sidqi 
shevardnadzes threeday cairo visit has been the focal point of 
a middle east tour that has prompted questions about whether moscow 
snatched the peacemaking initiative from the united states 
in washington president bush denied he had yielded ground to the 
soviets and said he didnt want to be rushed into sending an 
emissary to the middle east 
he said soviet involvement was a good thing and he wanted to 
take prudent steps that would produce results

the prosecution demanded on tuesday 
that lebanese militant hussein hariri be sentenced to life 
imprisonment for hijacking an air afrique dc10 in 1987 and killing 
a french passenger 
prosecutor willy heim said the horror of the crime barred any 
leniency toward the 22yearold defendant he described as a killer 
blinded by conviction 
in a brief statement hariri identified in court as a member of 
the proiranian shiite hezbollah group said he regretted the death 
of passenger xavier beaulieu but that the hijacking was not an act 
of terrorism but was combat 
hariri faces charges of murder and hostagetaking in the trial in 
federal criminal court that began monday the fivejudge panel 
hearing the case is scheduled to announce a verdict and sentence on 
friday 
heims final arguments came after testimony by passengers and 
crew members including by a chief steward the congolese chief 
steward andre memba who he said he was an eyewitness of the 
executionstyle slaying of beaulieu 
an american on the plane said tuesday that he began writing his 
will after the frenchman was killed 
beaulieu was shot from behind and at close distance after a 
threeminute deadline set by hariri for the refueling of the dc10 
at geneva airport 
hariri told the court earlier he did not intend to kill beaulieu 
but that he fired without aiming when the 28yearold frenchman 
whose head was covered with a blanket made a threatening move memba 
said beaulieu was seated when he was shot and that hariri was 
standing behind him 
the witness was bought the way i bought the customs 
official hariri protested in french it was a reference to the 6 
bribe he paid to slip by controls at bangui the capital of central 
africa where he boarded the plane with a 765 millimeter pistol 
140 rounds of ammunition and 562 grams of tnt 
the french pilot edouard artizzu testified that a plo 
representative nabil ramlawi who negotiated with hariri at the 
request of swiss authorities was to be credited for talking the 
hijacker out of killing a second passenger 
hariri earlier said ramlawai who heads the palestine liberation 
organizations geneva mission was a traitor and blamed him for 
the failure of his mission 
the plane bound for paris was diverted over northern italy july 
24 1987 with hariri demanding the release of lebanon and 
palestinian prisoners held by french west german and israeli 
authorities the ordeal ended when crewmembers overpowered hariri 
while swiss police stormed the plane 
in earlier testimony the lone american hostage in the drama said 
he wrote his will on a page of a travel journal after he saw 
beaulieus body taken off the plane by two stewards 
this was the first point at which i really expected to die 
too said peter w schroth 42 i prepared a will which i gave 
to the steward 
schroth a lawyer and hartford conn businessman was the first 
passenger directly threatened by hariri while he was collecting 
passports to sort out french nationals 
he said hariri picked him after he was unable to turn over his 
passport because it was in his suitcase 
he placed his pistol against the back of my head and shouted to 
the other passengers look at this man if anyone moves he will 
die

president bushs plan for rescuing the savings 
and loan industry is based on overly optimistic economic assumptions 
and understates the programs true cost by billions of dollars 
private analysts said tuesday 
the white house office of management budget released figures 
tuesday showing among other assumptions 
longterm interest rates falling 3 percent in two years to the 
lowest point in 20 years 
savings and loan deposits growing at an annual rate of 72 
percent even as the government will be curbing highflying 
fastgrowing institutions 
these assumptions are highly optimistic exceedingly 
optimistic said bert ely a financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va theyre just not realistic 
if the administrations interest rate projections are off the 
government will have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more a 
year to finance the borrowing 
if the deposit growth is lower than predicted then insurance 
premiums paid by the industry will fall far short of the 32 billion 
projected over the next decade that will mean taxpayers will have 
to pay more 
bushs plan calls for raising 50 billion by selling bonds over 
the next three years the bonds will be sold in an offbudget 
arrangement which means the government will have to pay more in 
interest than on normal treasury borrowing 
the omb plan shows the special sampl bonds carrying a rate 03 
percentage points higher than longterm treasury rates thats a 
shade optimistic according to robert litan a banking expert with 
the brookings institution 
more importantly however the government shows longterm 
treasury rates falling from about 92 percent now to 62 percent in 
1991 which would be the lowest rate since 1968 
to say that thats optimistic is the understatement of the 
year litan said 
analysts said the deposit projections are in line with the growth 
rate of the past 10 years but are likely too high if the 
administration follows through with other parts of its reform 
program sampls under the bush plan would not be allowed to grow 
unless their owners put up more of their own money 
theres no way thrift deposits are going to grow that fast in 
light of the capital requirements ely said 
he also said the interest rate projections imply a very low rate 
of inflation and in the unlikely event that occurred it would make 
it much harder to meet the deposit growth targets 
meanwhile the house banking committee on tuesday looked at 
requiring independent certified public accountants hired by 
individual sampls to exchange information with federal regulators on 
whatever they uncover in their audits 
the committee was reviewing a general accounting office check of 
11 failed sampls in texas which found that accounting firms including 
some of the nations largest failed to uncover problems in six of 
the 11 
while the six institutions showed a net worth of 44 million in 
the independent accountants audits their net worth five to 17 
months later when they failed was a negative 15 billion said 
assistant comptroller general frederick d wolf 
the committees chairman rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates the sampl industry 
should have uncovered the audit problems long ago 
of the six audits found deficient by the gao and these 
include some of the most renowned horror stories the bank board 
has not taken action against a single one he said 
in another development rep frank annunzio dill who heads 
the house subcommittee overseeing sampls said the federal deposit 
insurance corp which insures commercial bank deposits may be too 
overworked to take on oversight the sampl industry 
as part of the presidents reform proposal the fdic would get 
jurisdiction over nearly 3000 sampls however annunzio who is 
fighting to keep sampl regulation separate from bank regulation said 
the fdic in the last two years has not conducted onsite safety and 
soundness examinations at hundreds of commercial banks under its 
oversight 
with over 200 bank failures last year we should be stepping 
up the number and frequency of bank examinations instead the 
bush plan will saddle the insurer of deposits in these banks with 
significant new responsibilities he complained

nato negotiators will offer to reduce 
some of the alliances conventional forces in europe when they meet 
officials of the sovietled warsaw pact in arms talks next month a 
us official said tuesday 
stephen ledogar the us representative at the upcoming arms 
negotiations said the proposal will be below but not too far 
below existing levels for the western alliance 
ledogar speaking on a us government satellite broadcast from 
washington said the north atlantic treaty organization was still 
working on its position for the talks on reducing conventional 
forces in europe scheduled to begin early next month in vienna 
we will be approaching the problem by trying to reduce the 
asymmetries the disparities which in almost all defense 
categories are in favor of the east he said 
we will not simply recommend that the east do all of the 
reduction but we for our part will offer to do some of the 
reduction too he said 
asked by a questioner about reports in germany that the west 
would offer a 5 percent cut in conventional forces ledogar replied 
while the percentage you mentioned is not firmly nailed down it 
is within the ballpark 
the western alliance contends the soviets and their allies have 
built up a huge superiority in conventional or nonnuclear forces 
in europe 
the 16 nato nations and the seven of the warsaw pact will take 
part in the negotiations which will cover the area from the atlantic 
ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
ledogar said the western nations would like to focus the initial 
bargaining on reducing main battle tanks artillery and armored 
troop carriers to equal levels 
the western approach he said will be to try to concentrate on 
those military equipments and armaments that give to one side or the 
other the capability to launch a surprise attack or sustained 
largescale offensive activity 
previous eastwest talks on reducing forces in europe called 
the mutual and balanced force reductions negotiations ended early 
this month after dragging on for more than 15 years without 
resolution the two sides could not agree on mutual troop strength 
and methods to police an eventual withdrawal 
ledogar declined to speculate on how long the upcoming talks 
might go on

fish and wildlife service officials in an 
effort to keep the spotted owl off the endangered list ordered 
changes in a report which originally said the bird may face 
extinction according to a general accounting office report released 
tuesday 
the gao an arm of congress said officials ignored scientific 
evidence and ordered revisions in a study prepared by biologists in 
the agencys northwest regional office scientists had concluded 
that unless logging was slowed in ancient forests of the northwest 
the owl could face extinction 
the timber industry in the northwest has opposed any effort to 
name the owl a threatened or endangered species fearing that such a 
move would disrupt logging in public forests environmentalists have 
advocated protecting the owl as part of their campaign to halt 
logging of old growth forests 
while changes are an inevitable part of any draft report review 
process the nature of the changes made in this case and the way 
they were made raise questions about whether objectivity was 
maintained the gao said 
the fish and wildlife service an interior department agency 
which determines what should be designated for protection as 
threatened or endangered is required to consider only biological 
factors in making its decision 
the service concluded in december 1987 that the owl which lives 
only in old growth forests of oregon washington and northern 
california was not endangered and refused to grant a petition 
requesting that the bird be protected 
the gao said decisions on whether to classify a bird animal or 
plant as endangered can often be surrounded by highly emotional 
debates centered on the decisions possible economic consequences 
rather than its biological merits 
in such cases especially the fish and wildife service needs to 
be able to demonstrate that its review process and ultimate 
decisions have been thorough independent and objective as 
possible gao said there is evidence the spotted owl process 
did not meet such standards 
the gao said agency management officials substantially changed 
the body of scientific evidence found in the original report 
the revisions had the effect of changing the report from one 
that emphasized the dangers facing the owl to one that could more 
easily support denying the listing petition the gao said 
the agencys decision not to list the owl as endangered was 
challenged in court and a federal judge has given the service until 
may 1 to provide additional information on how it reached its 
decision 
an agency spokesman on tuesday declined comment on the gao 
report we would like to at least read it first said craig 
reiben a fish and wildlife service spokesman 
the fish and wildlife services decision not to list the 
spotted owl as an endangered species appears to have been based on 
politics not science or law said rep gerry studds dmass he 
said he planned to ask fish and wildlife service director frank 
dunkle about the case at a hearing wednesday 
rep peter defazio dore said the gao report shows the 
decision not to protect the owl was a simple case of political 
expediency winning out over sound scientific evaluation and good 
policy 
we need the scientific facts about the spotted owl not the 
biased views of political appointees at the department of interior

oliver norths criminal trial opened tuesday 
with the prosecutor portraying him as a liar who places himself 
above the law but with norths lawyer defending him as a patriotic 
marine who obeyed unflinchingly the orders of his commander in chief 
north now retired from the service listened intently as 
prosecutor john keker told the jury the defendant had lied time and 
again to his president and to congress about the irancontra affair 
chief defense lawyer brendan sullivan countered that north a 
former top national security council aide worked in a secret world 
where he always acted with the approval of his superiors he acted 
always with the best interests of his country 
thus the two sides squared off for the oftdelayed first trial to 
come out of the irancontra affair a trial that may take as much as 
five months to complete 
the first testimony comes wednesday morning when rep lee 
hamilton dind the former chairman of house intelligence 
committee takes the stand 
keker told the jury tuesday that north had profited personally by 
using travelers checks furnished by a contra leader and on a 
broader scale had told lies that amounted to a crime that goes to 
the soul of our selfgovernment 
you will hear he considers himself a patriotic person but 
there is no higher patriotic purpose than to protect our system of 
government keker said to lie to congress because you mistrust 
it then is a crime and not a defense 
sullivan did portray north as a patriot saying he believed in 
the marine motto semper fidelis always faithful 
he lived with that marine corps motto he was always faithful 
to country to commander in chief to his family to those whose 
lives depended on him said sullivan 
and yet said the defense attorney lt col oliver north has 
in the end been abandoned by his government 
norths eyes moistened as sullivan wound up his opening statement 
almost in a whisper 
the lawyer said that north was the troubleshooter at the national 
security council and if a secret mission had to be accomplished 
it was let ollie do it 
when congress decided not to support the nicaraguan freedom 
fighters in 1984 sullivan said the president was angry and 
he vowed he would find a way to support them 
reagan ordered national security adviser robert mcfarlane to 
keep them together body and soul and it was then the job of ollie 
north sullivan said 
he recited a lengthy version of the history of the irancontra 
affair to the jury some of whose members appeared to be nodding 
off sullivan noted that while the reagan administration was barred 
by law from directly helping the contras officials solicited funds 
for the cause from other countries 
he quoted reagan as saying privately at the time if this leaks 
out well all be hanging by our thumbs outside the white house 
until we find out who did it 
north followed the opening statements of keker and sullivan with 
unflagging interest he sat upright during the presentations which 
took four hours sometimes looking toward his wife betsy who was 
in the front row of spectators 
the courtroom was filled to its 120seat capacity with reporters 
taking 60 the public got only 15 and the rest went to assorted 
lawyers prosecutors and government security experts us district 
judge gerhard a gesell allowed four representatives of intelligence 
agencies in court to monitor the large amounts of classified 
information expected to be revealed publicly in the trial 
north is charged with 12 criminal counts nine of them having to 
do with deceiving congress and the president the other three 
involve charges that he personally profited from the irancontra 
affair 
the need for secrecy is no excuse for lies keker said 
at one point he said a house committee had met with north in 
the white house seeking the truth about the situation 
the committee looked oliver north right in the eye and north 
looked them right in the eye and he lied keker said 
keker said north took 4000 of the 90000 in travelers checks 
that contra leader adolfo calero gave him to cover expenses 
colonel north used that 4000 like it was his personal 
piggybank for groceries tires and to take his family on a trip 
keker told the jury 
keker called norths fabrications to a presidential inquiry an 
extraordinary criminal act by a man who at some point stops 
playing by the rules and places himself above the law 
but sullivan countered that north never broke the law that he 
followed the instructions of the highestranking officials of the 
united states of america 
north was a marine lieutenant colonel with 20 years service and a 
distinguished vietnam war record when he resigned from the service 
after his indictment last march 
sullivan who became known nationally during the 1987 
congressional hearings on the affair held up thumb and forefinger a 
quarterinch apart and told the jury he never had this much 
criminal intent 
north testified at the hearings under immunity from prosecution 
for anything he might say keker working for independent counsel 
lawrence e walsh had to develop his evidence for the trial without 
recourse to the hearing transcript 
keker told the jury that the bible says there is a time and place 
for everything 
when the time came for oliver north to tell the truth he 
lied keker said when the time came to come clean he shredded 
erased and altered when the time came to let the light shine in he 
covered up

the supreme court said tuesday it will use a 
case involving an abandoned movie project to examine penalties for 
law firms accused of breaking a rule against needless lawsuits 
the court agreed to hear an appeal by a defunct new york city law 
partnership ordered to pay 50000 for violating the rules 
the case stems from a lawsuit filed by northern j calloway an 
actor who plays the character david on televisions sesame 
street 
calloway sued marvel entertainment group and others accusing 
them of copyright and other violations on a proposed animated 
science fiction movie to be called the skyrider 
calloway sought 44 million in damages 
a federal judge imposed 100000 in sanctions against calloway 
50000 against his attorney ray leflore and 50000 against the 
now dissolved law firm of pavelic amp leflore 
the penalties were imposed for violating a court rule aimed at 
preventing frivolous lawsuits and herassing and delaying tactics by 
lawyers 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in upholding the penalties 
against leflore and the law firm last august said calloways 
case was at all times very weak from the very beginning his case 
suffered from obvious and grave weaknesses 
for example the appeals court said none of the people sued made 
any money from the proposed movie project and most lost money on the 
venture 
in its appeal to the supreme court pavelic amp leflore said the 
50000 sanction against the firm should be thrown out because only 
leflore and not the firm signed key papers in the suit 
leflore did not appeal to the high court to throw out the 50000 
penalty against him personally 
the case is pavelic amp leflore vs marvel entertainment 88791

computerequipped citizens can fire 
off an angry electronic letter to city hall see if their favorite 
book is at the library or check the bus schedule in a pioneering 
program switched on tuesday 
experts say santa monicas public electronic network is at the 
leading edge of a national trend linking local governments to their 
constituents through computers 
this affluent coastal los angeles suburb began enrolling computer 
owners in the service tuesday and city manager john jalili said 
interest appeared high though a customer count for the free service 
wasnt immediately available 
once a citizen has been enrolled and assigned a password to get 
into the system he or she will be able to tap into city files on 
proposed developments and other city council action find out how to 
get city permits and licenses get schedules for city services and 
get a range of consumer advice 
theyll also be able to sound off directing electronic mail 
at council members department heads and the public at large 
the city promises to respond 
i love it said michael hill a teacher and active citizen 
who was the first to sign up for pen we live in an electronic age 
and we have this technology that allows us to use computers to 
access information 
he planned to fire up his home computer tuesday afternoon to 
offer some ideas on how to fit a park improvement project into the 
new budget 
then ill probably email electronic mail the information 
services department head and congratulate him on a job well done 
hill said 
the system is housed in a computer separate from the citys 
internal data processing to head off the threat of hackers 
seeking inside information or planting destructive viruses 
although santa monicas system appears to go further than most 
many local governments around the country are experimenting with 
computer citizen communications said ted shogry of public 
technology inc a washington dc group that researches 
technology for local governemnts 
kansas city mo and hillsborough county fla have 24hour 
city halls which allow citizens to browse through reams of 
information using computer kiosks set up in public places he said 
the organization is planning a 12city test later this year of a 
videotext information system linking citizens with their 
governments the cities have yet to be chosen 
charlotte nc and fort worth texas have voice mail 
systems for callers to get recorded information on a variety of 
services and problems he said 
its attracting a lot of interest by local governments across 
the country shogry said theres a growing awareness of how 
telecommunications and computer technology can be used to involve 
more people 
santa monicas jalili sees the system as a way to improve service 
to citizens 
first of all its going to stop the phone game where people 
are transferred to eight different places jalili said and 
there are people who during their work day cant call in and when 
they get home city hall is closed 
of course many people who need help or information from city 
hall dont have personal computers 
in santa monica known for the liberal politics of such celebrity 
residents as actress jane fonda project organizers are sensitive to 
the perception theyre bypassing the poor 
terminals have been installed in all libraries and there are 
plans to put them in recreation buildings and in a senior citizens 
center under construction 
elsewhere the equipment put in public places is designed for 
easy use by those who arent familiar with computers some have 
touchsensitive screens to make typing unnecessary and all have 
simple instructions to lead users throught the microchip maze 
my personal opinion is that for the electronic democracy to 
become a reality the needs of the poor or less educated will have 
to be kind of aggressively addressed shogry said 
in the case of santa monica a survey found 33 percent of 
residents owned personal computers and 23 percent had modems the 
devices needed to allow the computers to communicate over telephone 
lines 
for now the experiment is free to the city and to subscribers 
the 350000 system was a gift from two computer companies hewlett 
packard co donated the machines and metasystems inc provided the 
software 
but fees arent ruled out in the future said jalili depending 
on how much staff time is involved

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday defended 
a government order freezing cooperatives out of the medical 
business saying the private business was taking up too many 
government resources 
his remarks broadcast on the evening tv news program vremya 
came on a visit to lvov on his trip to the ukrainian republic 
the 57yearold soviet leader toured a television factory 
addressed city scientific and cultural leaders and held discussions 
with groups of citizens at the airport and on street corners 
the official soviet media said gorbachev will visit the chernobyl 
area on his trip nearly three years after the worlds worst nuclear 
power plant disaster occurred there 
gorbachev said in response to a complaint from an elderly woman 
about medical cooperatives that moscow officials heard some medical 
equipment was not being used in the staterun system so it would be 
ready for cooperatives which charge their patients 
after 2 or 3 oclock everything worked fine gorbachev said 
it turned out that in the first part of the day it was being 
prepared to be used for cooperatives 
in late december the government ordered cooperatives out of the 
medical field tv stores and other potentially highprofit services 
that also require relatively big investments 
government officials said they moved against medical cooperatives 
to ensure public health 
but leaders of the cooperative movement saw it as an effort to 
keep them out of profitable areas 
gorbachev has pushed the cooperative movement as a means to 
provide goods and services that the staterun economy cannot or will 
not provide he said the soviet union needs them but should control 
them through taxation and efforts to limit the amount of money their 
workers can earn 
lvov a railway automobile assembly and oil refining city with a 
population of 753000 lies 260 miles west of kiev in a part of the 
ukraine that became part of the soviet union only at the end of 
world war ii 
lvov is still a center of ukrainian nationalism 
gorbachev toured the elektron factory and factory workers told 
him about plans to increase output of tv sets which tass said were 
in short supply 
aside from being scarce soviet television sets are notoriously 
dangerous the staterun press has carried articles saying 
sovietmade color tv sets are prone to explode and are a major cause 
of fires 
gorbachev found out monday in kiev the republics capital that 
the dangers of nuclear power are still much on the minds of 
ukrainians 
in a street encounter broadcast on television an elderly woman 
asked gorbachev why another nuclear power plant was being built in 
the crimea 
the area contains some of the countrys most popular beach 
resorts and is home to 2 million people 
gorbachev said he was aware of worries about plant safety he 
said american specialists had been asked to study the crimean 
facility 
construction is under way he said but if the conclusion 
of the specialists is that it is not advisable to build a station 
there then it will be turned into a training center for personnel 
not an atomic power station 
an explosion and fire at a nuclear reactor at chernobyl on april 
26 1986 killed at least 31 people and sent a radioactive cloud 
around the world 
since then the soviets have moved away from complete faith in 
the safety of nuclear power and public opposition to it has grown 
last week moscow news said cancer cases have doubled in a region 
30 miles from chernobyl where people were not evacuated

senate democratic leaders said tuesday that 
congress will review a law governing the use of national security 
secrets in criminal cases because of the legal tangle created by the 
trial of oliver north 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the use of 
an independent counsel to prosecute north on charges of lying to 
congress about the irancontra affair had not been anticipated in 
the law covering how to handle secret evidence 
in this case the balance which the law assumed would be there 
does not exist mitchell told reporters it is obvious that the 
prior administration and this administration is not eagerly seeking 
prosecution indeed its political interest lies in no trial at 
all 
to help ensure that the administration did not forfeit the north 
case for political reasons the senate intelligence committee held a 
closeddoor session to hear from cia director william webster on the 
administrations reasons for dropping conspiracy charges against 
north in january norths trial on 12 other charges began tuesday 
we heard from members of the intelligence community who shared 
their national security concerns about information that could be 
developed during the course of the trial now under way said sen 
david boren dokla chairman of the intelligence panel 
boren declined to say whether he was satisfied that those 
concerns were legitimate or to characterize websters level of worry 
about the classified information saying he did not want to open 
himself to charges of influencing the case 
congress passed the classified information procedures act in 
1980 propelled by a spate of cases in which defendants threatened 
to disclose government secrets as part of their defense against 
criminal charges 
the law defines national security secrets and allows a trial 
judge to screen such information before a trial to determine whether 
the material can be used in open court the judge can dismiss a case 
or specific counts of an indictment if the government objects to 
disclosure of classified information 
the same law requires the justice department to report to 
congress on cases not prosecuted or charges dropped because of fears 
of disclosure of secrets 
we will carefully review the law when this is over to see if 
changes are necessary mitchell said 
we are dealing with situations here which might not have been 
anticipated by the law when it was written added boren it 
would be appropriate for us to reflect upon when all is said and 
done in the north case

the government said tuesday it will change 
a monument inscription saying the nazis killed more than 4000 
polish army officers during world war ii it cited a polish red 
cross document that indicates the soviets killed them 
the announcement came from government spokesman jerzy urban who 
stopped short of saying that the soviets were guilty of the crime in 
the katyn forest in western russia he also did not say what the 
warsaw monument will read 
we expect that this problem will be explained by the two sides 
and on the basis of more comprehensive information urban told a 
news conference 
urban referred to a broadcast by radio moscow on monday which 
according to urban said the red cross report was serious evidence 
requiring serious examination that the katyn crime was committed by 
soviet security forces in the stalinist epoch and not by the 
nazis 
the 12foot granite monument at warsaws powazki cemetery has an 
inscription at its base saying it is to polish soldiers victims 
of hitlerite fascism resting in the ground of katyn 
urban said the government also plans to move the monument now in 
an outoftheway corner of the cemetery 
the massacre in the katyn forest 12 miles west of smolensk is 
one of the most searing issues in polishsoviet relations and for 
years the word itself was too sensitive to be uttered in public 
official postwar histories all maintained the officers were 
killed by nazis in winter 1941 but most poles and western 
historians have said they were killed by the soviets in the spring 
of 1940 when the soviet union and nazi germany were still allied 
in addition to the 4300 bodies found at katyn 11000 other 
officers are unaccounted for and presumed dead after they were 
imprisoned in the soviet union in the first days of world war ii 
the officers represented about half of polands prewar officer corps 
the monument blaming the nazis for katyn was erected in april 
1985 and unveiled without public notice after some family members of 
katyn victims erected unauthorized crosses at the site in memory of 
the slain officers the crosses were taken down 
each aug 1 and nov 1 dates when poles remember their war dead 
large groups of people gather at the monument and many use candles 
and flowers to cover over the inscription they regard as false 
a joint committee of polish and soviet historians created in 
april 1987 is examining the katyn issue as part of an effort to 
correct blank spots in the two countries history 
in november the soviet newspaper izvestia reported that the 
soviet council of ministers approved plans for a monument in katyn 
for prisoners of war but the report gave no construction schedule

national republican party officials were in 
conflict with lousiana gop legislators tuesday over how to react to 
the election under the gop banner of former ku klux klansman david 
duke 
duke won a seat in the louisiana house of representatives on 
saturday and national party chairman lee atwater declared the party 
had no intention of accepting him as a member 
under atwaters direction a resolution was prepared declaring 
that duke was not a republican in gesture deed or belief 
the resolution is expected to be adopted by the partys 11member 
executive council which will confer by telephone friday 
however in baton rouge la republican legislators said they 
saw no reason to reject duke 
we cant be responsible for what he did before he was 
registered as a republican said rep art sour a republican i 
dont understand what atwater is talking about censure him for 
what the only control we have over him is what hes done since hes 
been a republican 
we will see if mr duke is what he says he is or what the media 
says he is said rep peppi bruneau of new orleans gop caucus 
chairman if hes what he says he is he has no problem he got to 
the house the same way everybody else did 
atwater also voiced concern that his effort to denounce the 
former ku klux klansman plays right into his hands by giving 
duke a new forum 
im going to refrain from discussing mr duke anymore 
atwater told reporters at the white house 
for national party officials the election of duke came as the 
gop was launching an intensive campaign to win support among blacks 
who have voted overwhelmingly democratic in national elections 
at a brief news conference tuesday president bush conceded his 
endorsement of dukes opponent might have been viewed by louisiana 
voters as improper or overkill 
but the president said i did what i did because of principle 
this man his record is one of racism and bigotry and im 
sorry i just felt i had to speak out 
duke 38 defeated homebuilder john treen 63 in saturdays 
election for a seat in the louisiana house of representatives 
despite endorsements for treen by bush former president reagan and 
the most powerful political figures in the suburban new orleans 
area both candidates were registered as republicans 
i have no desire to impeach him from office said atwater 
the gop chairman said he wanted republicans to officially 
disassociate ourselves as a party from mr duke 
atwater noted that duke had previously run for office as a 
democrat and had reregistered as a republican only three days 
before the election 
he is not a man who i think stands for either party said 
atwater hes an opportunist theres a 20year career there 
in which he was a man of the swastika vehemently antisemitic 
vehemently racist 
the gop chairman said he would henceforth refrain from discussing 
the duke matter because it plays right into his hands what he 
wants is to get into a prolongued argument with me on television 
any other kind of media 
hes a very effective demagogue and im not going to give him 
an opportunity to do that any more im not going to let myself 
become a dupe in his play to get more free media coverage 
atwater reiterated his contention that duke does not represent 
our party in any shape form or fashion

a frenchman fell to his death doing what he 
had done more than anyone else in the world parachute jumping 
he would jump with anybody anytime said ted mayfield 
founder of the pacific parachute center where 59yearold roch 
pierre charmet died monday when his parachute failed to open 
properly that was his whole life 
charmet who held the world record for the most parachute jumps 
with more than 14000 had made six jumps when he went up for what 
was to be the last for the day 
mayfield on tuesday recalled that on the way up charmet played a 
french drinking song something about knights of the round table 
drinking wine on a harmonica he recently learned to play charmet 
jumped out at 2500 feet 
normally you wait three or four seconds and pull out a 
handdeployed pilot chute said mayfield i could see him 
fighting with something at 500 feet the pilot chute came out then 
just a ball of material is all we could see 
he pulled the release on his backup parachute but it was too 
late mayfield said charmet landed on a stack of lumber 
an investigator from the federal aviation administration arrived 
tuesday to inspect the parachute gear which charmet had packed 
himself 
charmet lived in montlhery france and was an instructor with 
the parachute institute of france authorities said 
small and lightly built with a gray beard and long gray hair he 
learned to jump while serving with the french foreign legion in 
algeria in the 1950s and his 14600odd parachute jumps were 
recognized as the world record by the united states parachute 
association mayfield said 
his favorite saying was only skydivers know why birds 
sing mayfield said its the freedom he would feel of leaving 
the aircraft and being able to fly thats what he felt 
for the past 15 years charmet had been spending a few months 
each winter in this town of 2400 people situated about 45 miles 
southwest of portland 
he originally came here because he fell in love with a girl 
traveling in france who was from here mayfield said he 
followed her here when he arrived she was married to somebody else 
he liked the area and the people here so he just came back every 
year 
while in sheridan charmet jumped repeatedly and broke the world 
record here last year 
charmets passion was accuracy jumping leaving an airplane at 
2500 feet and landing on a 5centimeter target 
hed make like 800 jumps in three months mayfield said he 
would line up four or five parachutes pack them all then make four 
or five jumps he would do this all day long

the legislature meets in special session 
wednesday to debate gov buddy roemers second plan to overhaul 
louisianas tax system 
roemer who pledged during the 1987 campaign to change the 
states populistbased tax system to lighten some of the burden on 
businesses in order to create jobs saw his original outline fail 
before lawmakers in october 
legislators said their chief objection was a proposal to lower 
the states 75000 homestead exemption from property taxation to 
25000 roemer has dropped the proposal conceding it is 
politically impossible now 
its much more of a consensus plan roemer said of the 
revamped proposal the legislature has been much more intimately 
involved in this its not everything id like to have but i think 
its possible to pass 
roemer said his plan would reduce state sales taxes by 100 
million increase income taxes by 175 million give businesses a 
tax break and create a highway airport and port construction 
program through a 4cent excise tax on gasoline 
the 75 million tax break for businesses would be made up through 
income tax increases mostly in the upperincome levels the 
governor said 
roemer said the move would help create jobs in a state plagued by 
unemployment of more than 10 percent and help stabilize state 
government which has stumbled through several fiscal crises since 
the collapse of oil prices and faces a 654 million shortfall for 
the 198990 budget year 
if the plan receives the necessary twothirds vote from both 
chambers parts of it such as the income tax increase still must 
be approved by the voters on april 29 in the form of a 
constitutional amendment 
getting voters to back the plan may be the most difficult task 
one of roemers legislative floor leaders predicted 
rep ron gomez chairman of the house taxwriting committee said 
the program may be read by some voters as shifting business taxes 
on the backs of the people 
thats because weve operated so long under the rule of dont 
tax you dont tax me tax the man behind the tree well theres 
no one left behind the tree said gomez

a group of palestinians attacked and stabbed an 
israeli soldier during an army raid in a small west bank village 
late tuesday and the wounded soldier opened fire killing one of 
his assailants the army said 
elsewhere in the occupied west bank and gaza strip army gunfire 
wounded eight palestinians on tuesday including a 14yearold hit 
in his thigh a 13yearold shot in the leg and an 18yearold 
critically wounded in the shoulder arab doctors said 
businesses in the occupied territories remained shut for a third 
straight day in the longest work stoppage ordered by underground 
uprising leaders 
observance of the strike was seen as a key test of the strength 
of proplo leaders of the uprising that began on dec 8 1987 the 
rebellion has killed 384 palestinians and 16 israelis 
dedi zucker a leftwing legislator said tuesday that most 
palestinian victims in the west bank were killed during army raids 
in remote villages and a growing number of the fatalities were 
teenagers rather than adults 
zucker of the citizens rights movement said a new israeli 
human rights group called image was formed this week to rouse public 
awareness of complaints of abuses by soldiers in the territories 
which were captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war 
people are ignoring what is happening zucker told a 
gathering of the foreign press association in jerusalem 
an army spokesman said a band of palestinians attacked troops 
making a security sweep on tuesday in abu dis a village of 3000 
about three miles east of jerusalem and that one of them stabbed 
and slightly wounded a soldier while the others assisted in the 
attack 
he said the injured soldier fired on the group killing one arab 
and that the others were detained the spokesman who remained 
anonymous under army rules did not elaborate and it was not 
immediately clear whether the victim actually did the stabbing or 
assisted in it 
an official at east jerusalems mukassed hospital identified the 
man as 57yearold mohammed said rishik and said he was shot in the 
heart 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted family 
members as saying rishik was shot inside his house by men in 
civilian clothes but the army spokesman said he definitely 
participated in the attack 
zucker said a study of the 322 palestinians the army says were 
killed in the first 13 months of the uprising showed most west bank 
victims were from isolated villages rather than refugee camps often 
considered hotbeds of antiisraeli activity 
he said the raids are often staged to root out popular committees 
who declare autonomy from israeli authorities 
zuckers contentions challenged a key army assertion that 
soldiers use violence in the occupied territories mainly in response 
to stoning and firebomb attacks on troops and civilians 
an army spokesman said raids in villages were essential to 
maintaining order on west bank highways 
zucker whose party advocates a separate palestinian state urged 
the army to help prevent shootings by soldiers by giving stiffer 
punishments to troops convicted of violating openfire regulations 
also tuesday police officials said a jewish cabbie whose taxi 
burst into flames in the west bank on feb 8 was killed by a fire 
resulting from a technical fault in his vehicle and not a firebomb 
attack as earlier believed 
immediately after the death jewish settlers stoned arabowned 
cars and injured two palestinian motorists

the bush administration on tuesday targeted 
south korea and the 12nation european community for possible trade 
sanctions if the countries do not agree to lower trade barriers 
blocking us export sales of telecommunications equipment 
the decision was announced by us trade representative carla 
hills who acted after a fivemonth investigation required under the 
1988 trade act 
the law requires the united states to open negotiations with 
countries deemed by us trade officials to be blocking sales by 
american firms of telecommunications equipment 
if the talks dont succeed in removing trade barriers within a 
year the law requires the administration to impose trade sanctions 
however the administration has the option of extending the talks 
for as long as two more years if us officials believe that 
progress is being made 
the announcement said the decision was made by mrs hills after 
reviewing comments from industry labor other federal agencies 
members of congress and foreign governments 
criteria for the examination included not only trade barriers 
but also each nations market potential and any measurable progress 
that it might be making toward trade liberalization the trade 
office said in a statement

more than 100 jewish youths shouting free 
the pollards now took their case tuesday to the rainy steps of 
the justice department where they demanded a reexamination of the 
sentences and treatment of convicted spy jonathan pollard and his 
wife 
we will not be silent said jacob davidson president of the 
north american jewish students network which organized the rally 
of high school and college students most of them from the new 
yorknew jersey metropolitan area 
although attorney general dick thornburgh was not in town and no 
one from his office came outside to meet with the demonstrators 
davidson said i want them to know this issue is not dead 
pollard 34 was sentenced in april 1987 to life in prison after 
he was convicted of supplying classified us documents to israeli 
agents his wife anne hendersonpollard 28 was given a fiveyear 
sentence as an accessory to her husbands illegal possession of the 
documents 
nothing he turned over to israel damaged american society in 
any way said davidson comparing pollards situation with that of 
john a walker jr who provided countless us navy secrets to the 
soviet union 
both pollard and walker are serving life sentences at the federal 
prison in marion ill they are eligible to request parole after 10 
years 
mrs pollard whose sentence made her eligible for parole after 
20 months or last december was turned down by the parole board 
last summer said her father bernard henderson all three had 
pleaded guilty as part of pleabargain arrangements 
justice department spokesman loye miller said the pollard case 
is closed and there is no reason to reopen it he has attorneys and 
if they can make some kind of a legal point the legal process is 
open to them 
meanwhile israeli sources said elyakim rubinstein an envoy from 
prime minister yitzhak shamir was meeting this week with us 
officials in washington to try to work out an arrangement that would 
remove the threat of indictment or subpoena from four israelis 
connected with the pollard case 
the four israelis are col aviem sella pollards handler irit 
erb a secretary at the israeli embassy who photocopied the 
documents pollard provided yosef yagur an israeli attache who was 
one of pollards liaisons with israel and rafi eitan who was in 
charge of the pollard project all are in israel and have stayed 
away from the united states out of fear of arrest

soviet military forces left 10 million to 30 
million land mines behind them when they pulled out of afghanistan 
posing a tremendous impediment to the safe return and 
resettlement of millions of refugees a defense department official 
told congress on wednesday 
the official edward w gnehm jr deputy assistant secretary of 
defense for near eastern affairs said the pentagon operating under 
united nations auspices has begun a comprehensive program of mine 
awareness and disposal training for afghan refugees in camps inside 
pakistan 
a state department witness reported meanwhile the soviets have 
halted air strikes into afghanistan from bases inside soviet 
territory ending the largest remaining problem of active warfare in 
the country 
howard schaffer deputy assistant secretary of state for near 
eastern affairs said also that because the level of human need 
inside the country is enormous the bush administration is 
taking a fresh sympathetic look into the possibility of 
extending humanitarian assistance 
he also said without offering an explanation the state 
department is confident that whatever government emerges in kabul in 
the aftermath of the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
will be neither communist nor messianic islamic 
testifying before the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asian 
and pacific affairs gnehm said a 40person military training team 
part of a project dubbed operation safe passage has been 
dispatched to pakistan and will spend six months increasing the 
awareness of large numbers of afghan refugees of the threats they 
will face as they return to their homes 
he said afghan teams will be trained and given special equipment 
to neutralize and dispose of land mines in their country 
gnehm said that training posters have been produced in some of 
the principal languages of afghanistan which warn thousands of 
people have been martyred by mines dont touch mines they are 
deadly and all kinds of mines have been placed in afghanistan 
gnehm called the training program an unprecedented application 
of special military skills for alleviating suffering from the 
aftermaths of a terrible and brutal war 
estimates of the number of mines range from 10 million to 30 
million gnehm said most of the mines are antipersonnel devices 
that have been scattered almost indiscriminately 
responding to questions he said that while the soviets have said 
they would they were defusing mines and were giving the communist 
government in kabul maps showing their location to our knowledge 
neither of these things has happened 
he said the locations of the mines would be extremely difficult 
to map since many of the antipersonnel devices were sewn from planes 
and helicopters 
he said an another danger is posed by the fact that heavy rains 
have washed some of the explosive devices down from hill and 
mountainsides into valleys used for farming 
gnehm also reported that since the first flight of an air force 
c5 cargo plane to pakistan in march 1986 there have been a total 
of 76 relief flights carrying more than 47 million pounds of excess 
defense department property and privately donated supplies all 
intended to aid the refugees 
additionally he said some 680 injured afghan citizens have been 
flown to western europe egypt and the united states to receive 
medical treatment

a retired judge tuesday recommended a 30 million 
increase in his 852 million judgment against amoco corp for 
oilspill damage from the 1978 wreck of a supertanker off the french 
coast 
the revised award would be shared by the government of france 
which would receive the single largest portion 444 million and 
some 100 french towns affected by the spill that fouled 100 miles of 
coastline 
frank mcgarr who retired as a us district court judge after 
his 1988 ruling continues to serve as special master in the case 
and made the recommendation after being asked by parties in the case 
to reconsider the award 
the recommendation is subject to approval by another federal 
judge no date has been set for a final judgment 
both sides objected to the revised award as well and vowed to 
appeal none of the money has been paid the towns had received 73 
million in the original judgment and sought an additional 8 million 
but received only 200000 more 
todays damage determinations continue to support the position 
the amoco parties have maintained throughout that the claims of 
damage from this unfortunate incident were exaggerated 
chicagobased amoco said in a statement 
what we will be asking the appeals court to do is recognize the 
damage to the environment the livelihoods of the people in 
brittany and the quality of life said attorney barry kingham 
who represented the towns association of oystermen and fishermen 
hoteliers and the two french counties most affected by the spill 
the judge refused to recognize those damages and he continues 
to reject them he simply gave outofpocket expenses for the 
cleanup effort 
attorneys for both sides said the revised award totals about 115

rep bill grant a littleknown democratic 
congressman from a conservative district in the florida panhandle 
bolted to the republican party on tuesday in a move president bush 
hailed as good news for our party 
grant easily won election twice as a democrat even as his state 
was moving toward republican candidates 
florida is on the move bush who met with grant about the 
switch last week said before network television cameras the 
nation i think benefits from this 
house speaker jim wright leader of house democrats said 
it took me by surprise but thats everyones choice i hope 
hes happy 
grant 46 a former banker from the small town of madison in the 
states panhandle was officially changing his voter registration 
later in the day 
his switch tips the balance in the makeup of floridas house 
delegation leaving it at 10 republicans and 9 democrats and 
breaking the democratic partys longtime majority 
bush said the change is good news for our party not only in 
florida not only in the south but nationally 
democratic national chairman ron brown said im frankly not 
real concerned about it but some other democrats voiced outrage 
that grant would change parties so soon after the election and rep 
beryl anthony dark chairman of the democratic congressional 
campaign committee said finding a democratic challenger would be a 
top priority for the committee 
charles whitehead florida state democratic chairman called 
grant a political opportunist who plans to run for statewide 
office he said grant should resign and seek his seat again as a 
republican 
whitehead said grant supported democratic presidential nominee 
michael dukakis last year and after appearing at a joint campaign 
event emphatically requested that he be allowed to have 
photographs made with governor dukakis 
bush was asked if grants change helps the party overcome its 
embarrassment at the election saturday of david duke a former 
leader of the ku klux klan to a seat in the louisiana legislature 
as a republican 
bush defended his stated opposition to duke and that of lee 
atwater the national gop chairman but acknowledged that maybe 
there was some feeling in metairie la that the president of the 
united states involving himself in a state legislative election was 
improper or overkill 
grant met with the president thursday about changing party 
affiliation and made his decision over the weekend said republican 
consultant charles black 
black who knew grant through mutual political friends put grant 
in contact with atwater who arranged the meeting with the president 
grant said his switch is not going to change my values nor 
will it change the way that i vote 
after a period of prolonged and careful deliberation i have 
determined that i can better represent the values and the priorities 
of north floridians in the state of florida as a republican he 
said 
another florida congressman andy ireland switched from the 
democratic to republican party four years ago 
the most successful of the recent party switchers has been sen 
phil gramm of texas who became a republican in 1982 as a house 
member and later won election to the senate unlike the later 
florida defectors however gramm resigned his seat when he made the 
switch and then won election to his old seat in the special election 
that followed 
grant served four years in floridas state senate before winning 
election to the house in 1986 when 12term rep don fuqua a 
democrat retired grant won 51 percent of the vote in a 
fivecandidate primary and had no republican opponent in the general 
election 
grants 2nd congressional district stretches along the border 
with georgia from near panama city to just west of jacksonville and 
includes tallahassee the state capital 
last fall two republican upsets in races for traditionally 
democratic congressional seats eroded the democrats majority in the 
florida delegation at the same time republicans picked up one of 
floridas senate seats with the retirement of democrat lawton chiles 
grant has been active in the democratic party and had figured in 
speculation for a possible run for governor in 1990 he drew 
publicity last summer for his unsuccessful campaign in support of 
sen bob graham for the democratic vice presidential nomination 
rep guy vander jagt chairman of the national republican 
congressional committee called grants switch further proof that 
we are moving toward majority status 
grants decision hardly changes the overall house balance 
however democrats have a 258175 advantage with two vacancies 
after the switch

private donors

president bush plans to nominate career 
diplomat john negroponte as ambassador to mexico the white house 
announced tuesday despite objections in that country 
when word spread last month of bushs intention to nominate 
negroponte a number of prominent mexicans recommended that their 
government reject the appointment because of his role in supporting 
the reagan administrations central america policy 
negroponte served as ambassador to honduras during reagans first 
term and later worked as deputy director of the national security 
council 
bush and mexican president carlos salinas de gortari held a 
friendly meeting after bushs election last november but the 
prospective appointment of negroponte has still become an issue 
between the two governments 
negropontes strong identification with reagans central america 
policy comes against a background of long years of mexican hostility 
to the us approach to that region 
the criticism has come from both the right and left 
national authorities have the right to keep officials who are 
highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming 
posts in mexican territory said diego fernandez a leader of the 
conservative national action party 
amalia garcia of mexicos largest leftist party also urged 
salinas to reject the appointment 
and a member of the centerleft authentic partys congressional 
delegation oscar mauro ramirez said negroponte is an expert in 
combatting latin american libertarian forces 
the uproar over negroponte prompted the outgoing us ambassador 
to mexico charles pilliod to predict that relations are going to 
improve further because negroponte has always done his job with 
efficiency and dedication 
negroponte said tuesday in a telephone interview i am very 
honored that president bush has nominated me for this extremely 
important position if confirmed by the senate i sincerely hope 
that during my tenure as ambassador i can make a positive 
contribution to usmexican relations 
the most difficult issue facing the two countries is how to deal 
with mexicos 103 billion foreign debt another problem is mexicos 
objection to a us plan to dig a ditch near san diego to reduce 
border crossings by drug smugglers and illegal immigrants 
negroponte 49 was deputy assistant to reagan for national 
security affairs beginning in 1987 and before that served two 
years as assistant secretary of state for oceans and environmental 
and scientific affairs 
he was ambassador to honduras from 1981 to 1985 he entered the 
foreign service in 1960 and served in hong kong vietnam greece and 
ecuador and as a member of the us delegation to the paris peace 
talks on vietnam in 19681969

a government regulatory agency concluded 
tuesday that the chicago board of trade the worlds largest futures 
market does a poor job of detecting abuses and investigates 
potential violations sluggishly 
the commodity futures trading commission which reviewed the 
board of trades performance from july 1987 to april 1988 said the 
boards routine computer surveillance program was not properly 
tailored to efficiently identify potential trading abuses 
the commission staff believes that significant modifications 
to the surveillance program are necessary for an effective 
system the report said it called on the exchange to expand the 
number of futures contracts reviewed per month the amount of 
trading activity examined each day and the number of traders 
analyzed 
a similar criticism was levied by the agency in its last review 
of the board of trade in 1986 but received little public attention 
however the latest report comes as a federal grand jury in chicago 
is reviewing evidence from a twoyear fbi undercover investigation 
of widespread alleged abuses at the board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
in reaction to the fbi probe congress is closely scrutinizing 
both the chicago markets and the commissions oversight of them the 
agencys legislative authorization expires sept 30 and congress may 
demand reforms before passing it 
the commission praised the board of trade on several points 
saying it effectively collects information on and monitors general 
market activity it thoroughly investigates specific complaints from 
customers or referrals from other traders and it levies appropriate 
punishments for violations 
however the agency said the exchange did not interview all 
individuals who might have had knowledge of questionable activity 
and it noted undue delays in completing investigations 
the completion of numerous investigations was unduly 
delayed because of the lack of timely supervisory review the 
report said 
in response to the report board of trade officials noted that 
the exchanges directors voted earlier this month to spend 1 
million this year to improve the exchanges computerized trade 
reconstruction system which is designed to catch improper trades 
officials estimated then that the system was about 90 percent 
effective in catching abuses they said the upgrade would increase 
the systems effectiveness to 100 percent 
they also noted that over the past three years the exchange has 
expanded its investigative office by 75 percent 
we are always looking for constructive criticism about our rule 
enforcement record from the cftc board of trade president thomas 
r donovan said in a statement 
the cftc report took note of the improvements but said it is 
too soon to evaluate the changes 
meanwhile reps glenn english dokla and thomas coleman 
rmo on tuesday asked the cftc to delay approving new futures 
contracts until the completion of a house agriculture committee 
review of the agency and the fbi probe 
eric hauser an aide to english who is in charge of the 
committees review said the request would affect three active 
applications for new foreign exchange futures contracts filed by the 
chicago mercantile exchange

president bush on tuesday denounced as 
vicious rumor allegations against defense secretarydesignate 
john tower and declared they had been gunned down by a thorough 
fbi report a senate committee vote on the embattled nominee was 
tentatively scheduled for thursday 
urging the senate to move forthrightly on the nomination 
bush said at a news conference that he had personally reviewed 
portions of the fbi report into towers alleged drinking 
philandering and financial improprieties 
what i got from it was that there has been a very unfair 
treatment of this man by rumor and innuendo over and over again 
rumors surfacing with no facts to back them up the president said 
members of the senate armed services committee meanwhile 
scrutinized the report which the white house forwarded to committee 
chairman sen sam nunn dga and ranking republican john warner of 
virginia late monday 
the two senators said in a statement that the committee would 
meet in a closed session wednesday and hoped to vote thursday 
assuming that members of the committee have read and analyzed the 
latest fbi report 
asked about the closed committee session nunn later told 
reporters i want to hear what other people think too this is a 
committee decision not a decision by the chairman or the ranking 
members all the members will have access to all the information 
one republican on the committee sen john mccain of arizona 
said he had reviewed the fbis findings and saw nothing to 
disqualify tower i do not understand the problems that others 
have and i hope they will be more specific he said 
another committee gop member sen malcolm wallop of wyoming 
said he read the report and his reaction was one of deep personal 
anger at the system which permitted so many unsubstantiated 
charges wallop told the associated press that the allegations 
have proven to be unfounded and meanspirited and said he plans 
to vote for tower 
and senate minority leader bob dole of kansas said we ought to 
have a unanimous vote for tower 
but rep mickey edwards rokla a prominent conservative said 
tower should withdraw his nomination because he has lost the 
credibility needed to promote bushs defense agenda 
i think john tower has a substantial problem edwards told 
reporters i dont think that has anything to do with who hes 
sleeping with or whether he has one glass of wine before he goes to 
bed or two 
edwards said the question is whether tower a former republican 
senator who once chaired the armed services committee can be 
credible in dealing with defense contractors after accepting nearly 
1 million from major weapons manufacturers as a consultant since he 
left the senate in 1985 
brent scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
acknowledged in a briefing that policymaking is being undermined 
because bush has not been able to assemble his full team of pentagon 
and state department officials 
i think it is in a way unfortunate that the president doesnt 
have his national security team in place as yet of course that 
is a problem in making new policy scowcroft said but were 
moving ahead and im comfortable with that 
bush responding to reporters questions at the white house said 
he was convinced that he tower is not only capable of doing this 
job but will do it in an outstanding way 
published reports have said the fbi found that tower drank 
excessively in the 1970s but no longer does so asked about that 
and whether the former senator had undergone treatment bush replied 
i say there is no evidence of any kind of the disease 
alcoholism none none whatsoever 
bush said the report speaks to the fact that a lot of the 
charges id say all of these charges that weve read about 
have been rumor and a lot of it vicious rumor 
the president said the allegations against tower that have been 
hanging over this simply have been gunned down in terms of fact 
ive seen nothing in there that would make me if i was a 
senator vote against senator tower bush added 
senate majority leader george mitchell of maine told reporters he 
didnt know when the committee would act on the nomination and said 
the delay in the confirmation proceedings had been at the request 
of the white house 
warner said he met monday night with kenneth adelman the former 
arms control chief who in published reports last week was critical 
of towers conduct as a us negotiator in geneva warner said 
adelman had expressed an opinion based on facts the committee 
already had in its possession 
in another development the house commerce and energy oversight 
and investigations subcommittee met tuesday with former arms control 
chairman max kampelman as part of the panels separate inquiry into 
department of energy security clearances 
the house subcommittee is planning a closed session wednesday 
with berne indahl a state department security officer indahl had 
been sent to geneva in 1986 to investigate allegations of security 
breaches in the us delegation while tower was a member of the 
contingent 
indahl told investigators sunday that the separate probe had 
turned up allegations against tower said congressional sources who 
requested anonymity at that meeting the sources said indahl 
corroborated a report that tower while in geneva had used his 
secretaries as mistresses 
meanwhile the wall street journal reported in tuesdays editions 
that as a senator from texas tower profited from a lucrative oil 
investment arranged in 1981 by a corpus christi lawyer whose son 
tower recommended for nomination to the federal bench 
bush asked about the report at his news conference said i 
never heard such a report and youre telling me something i 
dont know anything about 
a spokesman for tower on tuesday denied there had been any quid 
pro quo involving the oil investment and the judicial nomination

leading dissident vaclav havel was 
convicted tuesday for his role in a banned rally and sentenced to 
nine months in jail in a trial that drew criticism at home in the 
east bloc and the west 
in a sixhour trial judge helena hlavata found the 
worldrenowned playwright guilty on charges of inciting citizens to 
take part in banned demonstrations and obstructing police officers 
havel was taken into custody jan 16 after gatherings in central 
prague and his continued incarceration has sparked unprecedented 
calls for his release at home and abroad 
the prosecutor had demanded a oneyear sentence for havel and a 
fine of about 2500 but ms hlavata decreed a ninemonth sentence 
which havel appealed and said no fine was necessary 
each time havel was brought to the courtroom during three breaks 
in the trial supporters kept in an adjacent stairwell by police 
yelled long live havel and demanded his freedom western 
reporters outside the courtroom said at least three people were 
detained 
in another courtroom seven other dissidents face hooliganism 
charges from their attempt to lay flowers jan 16 in memory of jan 
palach a student who burned himself alive 20 years ago to protest 
the 1968 sovietled invasion that trial was adjourned until 
wednesday 
in a closing speech havel defiantly declared he was not guilty 
of inciting people to attend a commemoration jan 15 for palach in 
pragues wenceslas square or of ignoring appeals to leave the square 
the next day 
i do not feel guilty but if punished will accept the sentence 
as a sacrifice for a good cause nothing in the light of the 
ultimate sacrifice of jan palach havel said 
he rejected what he said were prosecution attempts to label him 
antisocialist and antistate saying these labels have lost 
any semantic meaning through overuse 
in different stages of life three general secretaries were 
labeled like this slansky husak and dubcek havel said 
referring to former communist party chiefs rudolf slansky executed 
after a show trial in the 1950s current president gustav husak and 
alexander dubcek who headed the prague spring reforms of 1968 
but was replaced by husak in 1969 
havel a founder of the charter 77 human rights movement who has 
spent four years in jail after being convicted of sedition said the 
movement always had sought peaceful dialogue with the authorities 
warning voices of this kind were not listened to and today the 
present power harvests what it has sown the fruit of its proud 
attitude he said 
among the two dozen people in the tiny drab courtroom were 
havels wife olga his brother ivan and ivans wife dasha the 
only journalists were four czechoslovak reporters a soviet reporter 
and a correspondent from the associated press 
the family which has not been allowed to visit havel in jail 
was granted a fiveminute chat after sentencing ivan havel said his 
brother was touched by the support he has received inside and 
outside czechoslovakia 
seven witnesses were called including plainclothes police 
officer maj peter zak who said he had seen havel around the square 
before arresting him 
the prosecution argued on the charge of obstructing police 
officers that havel failed to obey warnings to leave the square 
several hundred had formed there jan 16 after the other dissidents 
were arrested for trying to lay the flowers 
until august when 10000 people marched in prague on the 20th 
anniversary of the 1968 invasion there had been no mass protests in 
the city for 19 years 
seven of the other dissidents on trial are members of charter 77 
and other independent groups formed in the last year in what 
activists say is a sign of the increasing dissatisfaction and thirst 
for reform in czechoslovakia an eighth dana nemcova is 
hospitalized and will be tried separately 
the case against havel on the incitement charge centered on an 
appeal broadcast via western radio stations after he received an 
anonymous letter on jan 9 the letter purported to be from a group 
of students who said they would use a commemoration for palach jan 
15 to repeat his act of selfimmolation 
havel argued he had a responsibility to dissuade anyone from such 
an action and said he telephoned the appeal to the western radio 
stations after his efforts to get it on czechoslovak state tv failed 
ms hlavata read transcripts from radio free europe and the 
british broadcasting corp to support the prosecution case 
a crowd of 5000 people gathered jan 15 on wenceslas square and 
was broken up by riot police using batons tear gas water cannons 
and dogs 
other demonstrations occurred that week in prague at the same 
time czechoslovakia had committed itself to new human rights accords 
at a helsinki conference in vienna 
the international helsinki federation whose representatives from 
the united states and austria were denied permission to attend the 
trial said havels jailing contravened the 1975 helsinki final act 
and the vienna accords 
in hungary where the communist party has legalized independent 
groups the official writers union protested havels detention in a 
public letter 
in czechoslovakia more than 2000 intellectuals some of them 
party members signed a petition calling for his release 
the banned rightist confederation for an independent poland 
organized a rally that drew about 1000 people to the main square of 
krakow poland to hear speeches supporting havel said robert 
bogdanski a spokesman for the solidarity information service he 
said authorities detained four people 
the west german government condemned havels sentencing saying 
it violates the spirit of recent human rights accords 
swedish foreign minister sten andersson said in a statement in 
stockholm that the sentencing indicates czechoslovak authorities 
dont respect the commitments they have made regarding human 
rights 
karel kyncl of the londonbased monthly magazine index on 
censorship said on british broadcasting corp tv news its 
turning the clock back to stalinism

leftist guerrillas attacked the 
countrys most important army base and an engineer detachment 
tuesday killing eight people and wounding 17 
the attacks came as representatives of el salvadors major 
political parties met in mexico with top commanders of the guerrilla 
army to discuss a modified insurgent electoral proposal the rebels 
say could end the war 
rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not only 
continue but will escalate said the farabundo marti national 
liberation fronts radio 
the 9yearold war has killed an estimated 70000 people most of 
them civilians 
the early morning attack on the 4000member 1st brigades 
headquarters was the fifth on a major military installation in this 
capital since november with jurisdiction over the capital and its 
environs the brigade headquarters is considered the countrys most 
important military installation 
the commander of the 1st army brigade reported no casualties 
inside the downtown base and that damage was negligible but he 
refused to allow journalists inside 
the rebels used two pickup trucks fitted with catapults the 
detonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs and 
simultaneously blows up the vehicle 
the explosion of one of the vehicles killed pedro martinez about 
70 years old and his wife maria teresa about 65 who lived in a 
house near the headquarters 
the rebels also attacked the headquarters of the detachment of 
engineers in zacatecoluca 35 miles southeast of san salvador 
officers there said three soldiers including a major were killed 
at zacatecoluca one civilian and a civil defense trooper were 
killed in fighting nearby 
martinezs body lay on the sidewalk in front of his humble home 
an hour after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded at 620 am 
col orlando zepeda commander of the first brigade said mrs 
martinez whose legs were blown off by the blast died on the way to 
the hospital he said three people all civilians were wounded by 
the explosions

hit the truck in which they were traveling one civilian and one 
civil defense trooper were killed in a clash in a nearby village 
canjura said 13 soldiers and one civilian were wounded in the 
fighting there was no immediate word on guerrilla casualties 
in mexico the guerrillas proposed that elections be postponed 
from march 19 to june and that a ceasefire be insituted it was a 
switch from previous demands the election be postponed until 
september but left constitutional problems unresolved 
the constitution calls for president jose napoleon duarte to 
leave office on june 1 rightwing and center political parties have 
opposed any change in that date and the army has hinted of a coup if 
duarte overstays 
the guerrillas say the parties are hiding behind the constitution 
because they dont want to negotiate seriously

communist leaders have asked historians 
and jurists to determine whether political trials in the 1950s were 
rigged an official said tuesday 
the move could be a step toward rehabilitating leaders of the 
1956 anticommunist uprising some of whom were executed and buried 
in unmarked graves 
the communist party leadership on the second and final day of a 
central committee meeting also heard a report on the new 
constitution which is to leave out any reference to the leading 
role of the party and allow a multiparty system 
gyoergy fejti secretary of the party central committee said the 
party has asked that a panel of legal experts and historians look 
into the period from 1946 to 1962 to expose any possibility of 
rigged procedures at trials conducted during that period 
in search of a public consensus we must strive to see that 
suitable amends are made to those affected within the rehabilitation 
process fejti told a news conference at the close of the meeting 
but he appealed for patience and understanding saying the 
historical review would take time and we dont know what the 
results will be 
the announcement came less than 10 days after the 108member 
central committee partially reassessed the 1956 revolt that meeting 
was provoked by leading reformer imre pozsgay who said the revolt 
that for 32 years was termed a counterrevolution was a popular 
uprising 
the leadership of the ruling hungarian socialist workers 
communist party reached a compromise formulation saying the revolt 
had both popular and counterrevolutionary elements 
the revolt led by imre nagy against the regime of the stalinist 
matyas rakosi started oct 23 1956 and was brought to a bloody 
end nov 4 that year when it was quashed by soviet troops 
nagy and his associates were executed in june 1958 according to 
a ministry of justice decree issued at the time he and his 
associates were sentenced to death for conspiracy to overthrow the 
hungarian peoples democratic system 
there have been repeated calls in hungary for the rehabilitation 
of nagy and his associates authorities announced recently that they 
would allow their reburial in marked graves 
the purpose of the meeting ending tuesday was to review main 
concepts in the new constitution that will allow a multiparty 
system place greater emphasis on human and civil rights and 
strengthen political institutions including giving the president 
and parliament a larger role 
fejti presented the main concepts of the new constitution which 
is to be adopted next year 
we do not see the need and sense of the constitutional 
formulation on the leading role of the communist party he was 
quoted by the official mti news agency as saying 
however he added that this does not mean that the hswp 
hungarian socialist workers party renounces the political effort 
and intention that it wishes to remain the determining factor of the 
social processes mti said 
justice ministry officials said in december that the draft of the 
new constitution did not contain a reference to the leading role of 
the party 
fejti said it is necessary to set down in the new law the 
criteria that groups will be allowed to form if they are in 
harmony with the values and efforts formulated in the constitution

the energy departments master plan for 
refurbishing its nuclear weapons plants puts too little emphasis on 
environmental cleanup at the decrepit facilities a general 
accounting office official told a house panel tuesday 
j dexter peach the gaos assistant comptroller general also 
raised questions about the departments proposal for building two 
new nuclear reactors to produce tritium a perishable gas used in 
the manufacture of nuclear warheads 
the agency the investigative arm of congress has prepared more 
than 50 reports on pollution and operational problems in the weapons 
industry since 1981 and has been critical of the energy departments 
past management of arms plants 
peach told a house armed services subcommittee that the energy 
departments plan if carried out would revitalize the nations 
nuclear weapons complex by the year 2010 but would leave key 
environmental problems unsolved the plan envisions spending at 
least 244 billion over the next 21 years with 32 billion is 
earmarked for cleaning up environmental damage 
in our opinion the plan does not adequately address the 
cleanup of existing facilities and decontamination of facilities as 
they are retired from service peach said 
the energy department plan was endorsed by former president 
reagan shortly before he left office president bush has not said 
whether he supports it 
james d watkins bushs designated energy secretary has not 
commented publicly on the modernization report but he was almost 
certain to face intense questioning about it at his senate 
confirmation hearing wednesday 
peach in his testimony said congress should closely review the 
energy departments announced plans to build two new reactors to 
produce tritium the departments only existing tritiumproducing 
reactors are shut down because of safety and technical faults and 
they are expected to be permanently retired in the 1990s 
the energy department wants to spend 68 billion to build the 
two new reactors some critics have questioned the need for both 
reactors in view of the possibility that future ussoviet arms 
control deals could reduce the need for tritium 
troy e wade ii the departments acting assistant secretary for 
defense programs told the house panel the high cost of building the 
new reactors was justified 
it is an issue of capacity to assure the necessary supplies 
over the next two decades he said adding that it would be 
prudent to have new reactors based on two different technologies in 
order to guard against possible failures 
peach criticized the energy department master plan for failing to 
spell out how and over what time period the environmental damage 
caused by nuclear weapons production such as contaminated soil and 
groundwater could be cleaned up 
uncertainty still exists not only regarding the size of the 
problems but also regarding the extent to which doe sites can be 
cleaned up some locations may be irreversibly contaminated peach 
said 
peach said the master plan calls for spending 401 million in the 
coming budget year on environmental cleanup that eventually will 
cost up to 70 billion 
several members of the house panel including john spratt 
dsc also criticized the energy department saying it has put 
more emphasis on nuclear materials production than on safe and 
environmentally sound operations 
ray berube the departments deputy assistant secretary for 
environment said there is no current immediate public health and 
safety risk posed by the weapons plants he said there would be a 
threat if the environmental issues were put off 
wade meanwhile said the department still expected to restart at 
least one of its tritiumproducing reactors at the savannah river 
plant in south carolina by the end of the year he said a firm 
timetable would be available next month

boris n yeltsin the maverick former moscow party 
chief called himself a close supporter of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policies tuesday as he sought to represent the capital 
in a new legislative body 
yeltsin fired by gorbachev in november 1987 after he criticized 
the communist partys style of leadership was one of 10 candidates 
for nomination to go before an electoral commission of almost 900 
members in the chandelierlit redandwhite hall of columns in 
downtown moscows house of unions 
from the viewpoint of the strategy of external politics i 
fully support him yeltsin said from the viewpoint of the 
strategy of internal politics fully from the viewpoint of tactics 
i have my own opinion 
thats only natural he added 
the burly 57year old yeltsins shock of white hair stood out at 
the podium and his voice boomed through the hall 
the commission is one of the stages set up by a confusing 
electoral law approved last december candidates for a new 
2250member congress of peoples deputies nominated by workers 
collectives must pass through the commissions before they are placed 
on the ballot for the march 26 election 
the commissions can place all the candidates on the ballot or 
limit it to any number the house of unions gathering met late into 
the night to choose the slate for a seat in the congress that will 
represent all of moscow 
it originally was to consider the candidacies of human rights 
campaigner andrei d sakharov and politburo member vitaly i 
vorotnikov but both pulled out sakharov demanded to be considered 
as a candidate from the academy of sciences and vorotnikov opted to 
run in voronezh a city south of moscow 
while one commission met in the house of unions another reviewed 
a list of candidates for a moscow district that included 
controversial editor vitaly korotich of ogonyok magazine 
yeltsin who became first deputy chairman of the state 
construction committee after falling out with gorbachev still has a 
large following in moscow 
dozens of his supporters held yeltsins portrait and banners at 
police barricades around the building and yeltsins sevenminute 
address to the electoral commission was interrupted six times by 
applause 
but yeltsin faced stiff competition from yevgeny brakov director 
of the giant zil automobile factory and former cosmonaut georgy 
grechko 
brakov presented a mainstream program supporting gorbachevs 
reforms and focusing on the need for better supplies of food and 
consumer goods 
he was nominated by 33 workers groups compared to 19 for yeltsin 
several brakov supporters taunted teltsin saying they did not 
want a candidate who was not a moscow native 
yeltsin built his career in the ural mountains city of sverdlovsk 
before moving to the capital in 1985 
under the election law candidates may be nominated in more than 
one geographical area in the initial campaign stages yeltsin also 
has been nominated in sverdlovsk where he could stand a better 
chance of being elected than in moscow 
until he was removed as a candidate member of the partys ruling 
politburo in february 1988 yeltsin was one of the staunchest 
backers of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness 
but gorbachev accused him of being overly ambitious and blaming 
others for his mistakes 
yeltsin said in his speech that bureaucrats seeking to retain 
their privileges comprised the biggest danger to reform he urged 
that the number of government ministries be cut 
yeltsin said the soviet union must create a system that will not 
allow stalinist abuses in the future 
hospitalized with heart trouble after being dismissed as moscow 
party chief yeltsin said he now was physically healthy and ready 
to fight

the leaders of west germany and 
britain on tuesday unexpectedly scheduled an april summit meeting 
after two days of facetoface talks failed to resolve differences 
over nuclear missiles 
british prime minister margaret thatcher unsuccessfully tried to 
persuade chancellor helmut kohl to go forward with the replacement 
of shortrange nuclear missiles in west germany 
at the end of the talks with kohl in frankfurt mrs thatcher 
also confidently predicted that the european economic communitys 
withdrawal of topranking diplomats from iran will be very 
successful 
the 12 eec nations decided on the move after iran called for the 
death of author salman rushdie author of the novel the satanic 
verses which moslems believe is blasphemous 
during a postsummit news conference kohl and mrs thatcher 
faced a round of questions replacing the approximately 600 lance 
nuclear missiles in west germany 
constancy is a very good factor mrs thatcher said 
referring to her governments insistence on replacement of the 
missiles constancy and consistency in politics are very strong 
very rare alas all too rare 
in a joint statement the two leaders reaffirmed the stance of 
the march 1988 nato summit which called for nuclear weapons to be 
kept up to date where necessary they also agreed to meet in 
april in kohls hometown of oggersheim to discuss the missile issue 
we shall meet again before the next nato summit in may with 
the objective of making it a success and i dont think we can go 
further than that at present she told more than 150 journalists 
gathered at frankfurts city hall 
last week kohl and visiting us secretary of state james a 
baker attempted to minimize differences over the missile issue 
kohl wants the decision on replacing the weapons put off until 
1991 or 1992 after next years national elections 
nato calls the plan modernization but west german officials 
say it really is the replacement of the aging lance missiles with 
new longerrange missiles capable of traveling about 300 miles the 
lance missiles pointed at east germany and czechoslovakia have a 
range of nearly 75 miles 
west germany fears that replacing the missiles could derail 
efforts to improve eastwest relations

two men arrested at the home of 
black activist winnie mandela appeared in court tuesday on charges 
of murder abduction and assault 
jerry richardson and jabu sithole were not asked to enter pleas 
at their arraignment in soweto magistrates court their case was 
postponed for a week 
it is part of a growing scandal surrounding the wife of jailed 
african national congress leader nelson mandela and a group of 
unofficial bodyguards who lived at her home in soweto the huge 
township outside johannesburg 
in a british broadcasting corp television interview broadcast 
tuesday mrs mandela again denied involvement in the murder of 
14yearold activist stompie seipei and accused south african 
authorities of trying to divide the countrys black majority to make 
it easier to release her husband 
it would suit the government to release comrade mandela to this 
present situation where he has nowhere to go to in the sense that 
here he would find a community he led 26 years ago as divided as 
ever she said 
the bbc said the interview was conducted within the last 24 
hours at her home in soweto 
that it could even be dreamt that i would be responsible for 
the murder of a child when i have spent all my life fighting against 
these injustices appalls me she said 
mrs mandela said police have not so far questioned her about the 
killing 
sithole was a member and richardson described himself as coach of 
the bodyguards who called themselves the mandela united soccer club 
antigovernment leaders last week accused mandela united of 
waging a reign of terror they renounced mrs mandela and urged 
their followers not to associate with her 
richardson and sithole are accused of helping to beat up four 
blacks at mrs mandelas home in december one of them seipei was 
found murdered in january 
the three surviving young men have implicated the bodyguards in 
their abduction and also say mrs mandela was involved 
according to their lawyer 
police raided mrs mandelas house before dawn sunday and 
arrested four men including richardson and sithole the other two 
have been released 
they reportedly removed a pair of bloodsoaked sneakers a knife 
clubs whips and a pair of gardening shears police also took 
samples of what state radio reported were bloodstains from the walls 
of some back rooms where the bodyguards lived 
mrs mandela 54 has denied being at home when the three men and 
seipei were brought there but she has defended their abduction and 
said they probably were slapped to get them to talk about alleged 
homosexual activities at the methodist church residence where they 
lived the church denies her allegations 
in a related development a former member of mandela united has 
been charged with the killing of another team member 
andrew ekaneng 20 appeared briefly in court monday but was not 
requested to enter a plea to a murder charge in the death of maxwell 
madonda who was fatally stabbed last week in soweto 
ekaneng had a knife wound that stretched from one ear to the 
other the south african press association reported the independent 
news agency said members of mandela united attacked their former 
colleague and left him for dead but he survived 
last week mrs mandela followed her husbands instructions and 
decided to remove the bodyguards from her home 
the scandal has damaged the credibility of a woman who was at the 
forefront of the fight to end white minority rule in south africa 
her husband the countrys most revered black leader has been 
jailed for 37 years of their 40year marriage mandela is serving a 
life sentence for plotting to sabotage the government

seven gun owners assisted by the 
national rifle association prepared tuesday to ask the california 
supreme court to rule that state law preempts city bans on 
semiautomatic rifles in stockton and los angeles 
the two cities enacted ordinances this month after a gunman 
killed five children and wounded 30 other people at a stockton 
elementary school on jan 17 
the gun owners including two stockton residents and two los 
angeles police officers prepared to file suit directly to the state 
supreme court because the two cities and other communities that have 
enacted similar laws are in different state appellate districts 
said richard gardiner assistant general counsel for the nra 
the case belongs in the high court because it is of significant 
statewide importance gardiner said 
four of the plaintiffs told a news conference at a universal city 
hotel that the city ordinances take away rights and instill fear 
that the bans will lead to action against other types of firearms 
gardiner and the gun owners said that rather than controlling 
guns the justice system should deal more strongly with criminals 
such as the stockton gunman patrick purdy who killed himself after 
the schoolyard massacre 
im paying the price that unfortunately the man who committed 
the crime in stockton is not alive to pay said bill hilburn a 
department of energy engineer who lives two miles from the stockton 
school nobody is more outraged about what happened in my 
hometown 
tony acevedo 35 complained that the stockton city councils 
action makes him a criminal for owning such weapons 
donald castillo of los angeles an aerospace electronics 
engineer said he was interested in target shooting with such guns 
and he worries the bans will lead to attacks on other civil 
liberties 
im here because im scared to death castillo said 
andre coulombe a financial consultant in los angeles said he 
works with a youth explorer group and fears he will no longer be 
allowed to engage in such activities as firearms instruction which 
he says teaches discipline 
gardiner identified the other three plaintiffs as robert feeley 
a los angeles lawyer and sgt louis salsedo and officer george 
luczy both los angeles police officers 
los angeles officials said they will delay any attempts to 
enforce the ban on possessing the weapons until march 1 several 
other proposed gun bans are being considered in various committees 
of the legislature 
the nra counsel asserted that the city bans are really against 
all semiautomatic rifles he said the mechanism of the socalled 
military style assault rifles are the same as other types of 
semiautomatic rifles the only real difference he said is that the 
militarystyle weapons have certain external additions like 
bolts on the barrels or attaching bayonets 
gardiner preferred to use the term selfloading rather than 
semiautomatic and asserted that semiautomatic weapons that have come 
into question are not assault rifles he said only the fully 
automatic military versions of those guns which fire repeatedly 
rather than once with each trigger pull are assault rifles 
the whole thing is largely a media creation and needs to be 
treated as such gardiner said

a former teacher who admitted molesting boys as 
young as age 8 while he worked at a bureau of indian affairs school 
told congress tuesday he was surprised it took authorities so long 
to stop him 
paul wade price who is serving the third year of a 10year 
prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to one count of child 
molestation said in the videotaped testimony he molested at least 
25 students over the 14 years he taught at the cherokee elementary 
school in western north carolina 
price said his victims were primarily boys aged 8 through 12 
one that was the age group i was teaching and secondly im 
sure that there was the possibility that younger children dont 
generally tell things as the older children do he said under 
questioning by ken ballen chief counsel to a special investigative 
unit of the senate select committee on indian affairs 
price has been a prisoner at the butner federal correctional 
institution in butner nc since 1986 
the testimony came in the third week of hearings by the 
committee which has been looking into various alleged misdeeds on 
indian reservations within the bia and among other agencies that do 
business with indians 
after hearing testimony on contracting irregularities and 
organized crime involvement in indian gaming operations the 
committee is now concentrating on the problem of child sex abuse on 
reservations 
price told ballen he was surprised that he could continue his 
activity on and off for 14 years 
this is strictly hindsight price said looking back it 
certainly is a phenomenon that is hard to understand 
in 1974 as a provision for receiving federal aid congress 
required the states to enact laws mandating that individuals who 
suspect sexual abuse in a school report it to the authorities but 
there is no such federal law and state statutes do not apply to 
indian reservations and bia schools 
two teachers testified that they knew or heard rumors of prices 
activities but despite complaints to school authorities nothing 
was done until the fbi began its investigation in 1985 following a 
mothers complaint 
the mother keneithea haigler said that when she told the school 
superintendent that her 8yearold son had been molested by price 
they let me know that they knew what this teacher was doing and 
they were just waiting for some mother to come in and do something 
about it 
another mother patricia tramper said price threatened the boys 
if they discussed the matter with their parents 
price who was unemotional during his taped interview said at 
its close that he believes he always wanted to get caught because he 
could not stop himself from his activities 
ive had time of course in prison to reflect over this and te 
seriousness of it he said 
fondling is you know in my mind i was thinking it really 
doesnt hurt anybody but i know now how much it does hurt he 
said 
we just must find a way to help the children first and of 
course the molesters also above all the children who really 
dont know what theyre getting into he said telling the panel 
that he himself had been molested at the age of 8 
later witnesses from the bia said that despite a new policy 
requiring school personnel to report cases of sex abuse the bia 
does not get much information william mehojah bia branch chief for 
indian elementary and secondary school programs said no 
disciplinary action has ever been taken for failure to report 
mehojah and the others advocated enactment of a federal law 
similar to those in the states making failure to report alleged sex 
abuse a crime the opinion was echoed by two fbi agents who 
investigate crime on indian reservations in arizona and the dakotas 
and law enforcement officials working for the bia and local 
authorities 
fbi agent david small said interviews with pedophiles have 
indicated that child molesters gravitate to indian reservations 
because there is little supervision and they usually are in remote 
areas making it easy to prey on children 
robert haley general chairman of the indian law enforcement 
section of the international association of chiefs of police said 
investigation of child abuse cases are sometimes hampered by tribes 
which refuse to let the children off the reservation to testify 
mehojah said many teachers have gone to work before background 
checks were complete because of paperwork delays

dukakis was sentenced tuesday to a seven to 10year state prison 
term on an array of corruption charges or three years on top of his 
current federal prison term 
allowing for early release the judge who sentenced gerard t 
indelicato said he anticipated the former bridgewater state college 
president would spend 2 years behind bars on the federal and state 
charges then serve a lengthy probation 
indelicato administered an adult education program designed to 
help immigrants and the illiterate he was considered the mastermind 
of a plan that involved paying inflated classroom rent and receiving

counts of forgery larceny conflict of interest filing a false 
income tax return and lying to the state under a plea bargain

placed on file under massachusetts law the state reserves the 
right to prosecute those charges at a later date 
on the two forgery counts superior court judge robert w banks 
imposed a sentence of 7 to 10 years in the maximumsecurity prison 
in walpole with three years to be served after indelicato finishes 
the federal term under state law indelicato would be eligible for 
parole after one year 
on the other six counts he pleaded guilty to indelicato received 
concurrent sentences that would have totaled 18 to 25 years if 
imposed consecutively 
the 42yearold norwood resident is serving his federal prison 
term in pennsylvania 
indelicatos attorney steven brooks called the sentence 
severe for a public official who made a few mistakes but he 
did not say whether he would appeal 
as a special assistant to the governor indelicato is the 
highestranking dukakis administration official to face criminal 
charges dukakis has publicly condemned indelicatos actions and 
said his administration cooperated in the state and federal 
investigations 
last july indelicato was sentenced to 2 years in prison after 
pleading guilty in us district court in boston to five charges of 
conspiracy mail fraud and tax evasion in a scheme involving his 
brother and two other men to skim more than 80000 from the adult 
education program funded by the federal government and run by the 
state 
his case centered on activities that began between 1979 and early 
1983 he was dukakis education adviser from february 1983 to 
september 1986

the united states will send 20 
million worth of military equipment in the first us military aid 
to argentina since the 1982 falklands conflict the ministry of 
defense said tuesday 
ministry spokesman horacio altamirano said the equipment included 
spare parts for about 20 helicopters and 200 armored personnel 
carriers 
the deal was signed tuesday by gen fred woerner chief of the 
us southern strategic command and argentinas army chief gen 
francisco gassino altamirano said 
the us embassy did not return phone calls for comment 
the aid is the first since argentina and britain clashed in 1982 
over the south atlantic islands that britain owns and calls the 
falklands and argentina claims and calls the malvinas the united 
states supported britain in the conflict 
argentinas military budget has been cut in half to about 2 
percent of the gross domestic product since civilian president raul 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 ending a military regime that 
had been in power for nearly eight years 
officers have complained about not having enough money to draft 
and train recruits fly jets or buy the parts needed to keep 
foreignmade equipment running including m113 armored personnel 
carriers and bell helicopters 
the lack of equipment and the low military budget in general was

the new leader of paraguay has promised to help 
fight drug trafficking and cooperate in hunting nazi war criminals 
who may be hiding in the south american nation the first 
congressman to visit paraguay since the coup said tuesday 
rep bruce a morrison dconn said gen andres rodriguez told 
him during an hourlong meeting last week that rodriguez wants to 
change the reputation of paraguay as a refuge for thieves and 
scoundrels to a very different more positive place 
in our conversation the provisional president was very 
specific he even assured me that he is willing to receive requests 
from those who hunt war criminals because he wants to end 
paraguays historic reputation as a haven for exnazis drug dealers 
and third world dictators morrison said 
the congressman said rodriguez also promised to help fight drug 
trafficking paraguay is known as a key moneylaundering center for 
cocaine profits and there have been reports that rodriguez received 
some of the profits 
but morrison who later in the day briefed state department 
officials on his visit cautioned that the bush administration 
should base its policies toward paraguay on future actions not 
promises 
im not in any position to make a judgement about whats inside 
his head i think we have to judge him by the actions he takes 
morrison said there have been steps and theyre not 
insigificant 
rodriguez 65 ousted president alfredo stroessner in a coup feb 
3 stroessner came to power in a 1954 coup and used torture to 
repress political opposition in his early years of power later he 
eased up on the most blatant human rights violations relying on 
harassment detentions and explusions 
rodriguez already has vowed to respect human rights and pledged 
to respect freedom of the press abc color a prominent 
investigative newspaper shut down for nearly five years has been 
allowed to reopen 
but many are skeptical about how far reform will go under 
rodriguez who until recently was an ally of stroessner and who does 
not consider the former president a dictator 
this week rodriguez said elections will be held may 1 despite a 
request by the opposition to delay them opposition party leaders 
who had little chance under stroessners election rules wanted more 
time to organize they are considering an election boycott 
morrison said the quick election in the wake of the coup is 
clearly favoring the majority colorado party of rodriguez over 
the opposition but there are many people who would say that 
even a signficant delay of several months wouldnt be likely to 
allow the opposition to overcome the problem of years and years of 
being out of power

thousands of ethnic albanians stopped 
work or went on a hunger strike in troubled kosovo province tuesday 
protesting alleged antialbanian policies official media and 
sources said 
official sources interviewed by telephone in the regional capital 
of pristina told the associated press that the southern province is 
on the verge of a general strike 
also tuesday the official tanjug news agency reported a police 
official beat up a journalist who wrote about alleged corruption 
one of a string of recent attacks on yugoslav reporters 
the protest in kosovo was triggered by a hunger strike of more 
than 1000 ethnic albanian miners who refused to leave their pits at 
the trepca lead and zinc mine the miners allege discrimination by 
communist authorities in yugoslavias largest republic serbia of 
which kosovo is an adminstrative part 
thousands of other ethnic albanians in the economically depressed 
province walked off their jobs in other kosovo towns tuesday in 
support of the miners demands that the communist party chiefs of 
yugoslavia and serbia stipe suvar and slobodan milosevic come to 
talk with them media reports said 
the trepca miners near titova mitrovica 125 miles south of 
belgrade protested the official serbian policy that labeled them 
demonstrators nationalist and separatists when they took to the 
streets last november the state tanjug news agency said 
medical teams were sent to the trepca mines where some of the 
protesters have refused to take water and food for the past 24 
hours the provincial communist leadership has opened an emergency 
session to discuss the labor unrest tanjug said 
although ventilation in the shafts is being maintained the 
potential danger of an accident in the mine is very real agim 
bajrami a trepca employee told the ap adding that the miners had 
sealed off all the pit entrances not allowing anybody in 
the ambitious serbian party leader milosevic has been seeking 
to curtail the autonomy of kosovo which won broad independence from 
serbia by the current yugoslav constitution adopted in 1974 
serbian leaders want more control in kosovo to protect the slav 
population allegedly persecuted by the ethnic albanians who make up 
85 percent of the provinces population 
in november the trepca miners marched to pristina to protest the 
dismissal of some top provincial officials as demanded by serbias 
leaders and were joined by up to 100000 ethnic albanians 
in the southern republic of montenegro reporter milovan brkic 
was assaulted monday in the police headquarters in the capital 
titograd by ratko micunovic a department head of the state security 
police tanjug said 
brkic who had published a story claiming micunovic and other 
state security officials were corrupt lodged a formal complaint and 
was assaulted again by a group of unindentified thugs waiting 
outside tanjug said he was taken to a hospital for treatment of 
severe head and other injuries 
police said micunovic was suspended from duty pending an 
investigation tanjug reported 
last week a woman television reporter was beaten up by an 
unindentified attacker who first vilified her for a recent program 
in which she presented the albanian viewpoint in kosovo 
last month a police cordon prevented several dozen rowdies from 
breaking into the belgrade offices of the zagreb vjesnik daily 
angry about allegedly critical stories about serbias policies in 
kosovo

angry amazon indians thrust lances and 
machetes at government electric power officials tuesday in a second 
day of heated debate over a proposed hydroelectric dam that would 
flood tribal lands 
more than 500 indians from 37 native groups packed the citys 
community center for the historic encounter of tribes in this east 
amazon city 2000 miles northwest of rio de janeiro 
the meeting is the first united political movement by the native 
tribes and seeks to block construction of the kararao dam on the 
xingu river an amazon tributary brazil says the energy is vital 
for development in this land of 144 million people 
tempers flared when jose lopes engineering director for 
eletronorte the government amazon power company told the indians 
the dam would not raise the river beyond its present level 
youre lying everything you say is a lie shouted tuira a 
kayapo indian woman as she strode through the crowd and brandished a 
machete in lopes face 
her words in kayapo were translated into broken portuguese by 
chief paulo paiakan he said her gesture is one of our traditions 
it does not mean war 
kayapo warrior uhte also protested angrily and repeatedly thrust 
a redfeathered lance at the company offical 
we dont know what energy means i was raised on game fish and 
wild honey in the forest why didnt you consult us about the dam 
said uhte with paiakan translating 
the indians some wearing a greenandyellow feathered headresses 
and black warpaint on their faces and bodies raised their war clubs 
in a sign of agreement 
lopes said eletronorte was preparing an environmental impact 
report on the kararao project if the dam affects indian land it 
must be approved by congress he said 
brazils indian population has been decimated by development 
projects such as hydroelectric dams and the transamazon highway 
there are about 220000 indians left in brazil down from an 
estimated 5 million when the country was discovered by portuguese 
explorers in 1500 
the dam is not a reality until construction starts and that 
wont happen for at least five years lopes said he said 
eletronorte has scrapped plans for other contested amazon dams at 
babaquara and iriri 
chief paiakan also complained that indians had not been consulted 
about the name of the dam kararao is a kayapo war cry he said 
to our youths the government is calling us to war paiakan said 
lopes promised the project would be given a white name 
earlier in brasilia interior minister joao alves said the 
government would not consider stopping the kararao project he said 
the dam was fundamental for brazils future and would dislocate only 
about 280 indians 
kararao will generate 11 million kilowatts of electricity alves 
said second only to the itaipu dam the worlds largest located 
on brazils southwestern border with paraguay 
brazilian and international environmental groups attending the 
fiveday meeting said the kararao project was probably unstoppable 
i dont think its likely theyll stop construction of kararao 
but that doesnt mean the meeting is a waste said barbara 
bramble a director of the washingtonbased national wildlife fund 
this could be a real milestone in the formation of alliances 
among amazonian peoples to work together to save the place they live 
in 
joining the protesters was british rock star sting who told the 
amazon indian chiefs he was starting an international campaign to 
raise money to create a huge amazon national park he said the 
campaign would begin april 12 in paris 
im not here on behalf of one people if the rain forest dies 
all of us are in danger sting said 
he said he got permission for his project from president jose 
sarney

the president of the american federation 
of teachers says that unions havent been quick enough in keeping up 
with changes in the workforce 
and albert shanker espouses unorthodox methods of restoring the 
stature of unions in the workplace including the schools where his 
members teach 
among his proposed changes in the education system are abolishing 
the department of education and placing its duties in the labor 
department firing incompetent teachers and transforming high 
schools into campuslike environments where students have some 
flexibility in choosing classes 
in this country we go on the pendulum swing system shanker 
said tuesday during a breakfast meeting with reporters covering the 
aflcio executive council meeting here first we had tough schools 
with rigorous standards where most kids are pushed out then we move 
to soft schools where everybody graduates but very few learn 
anything 
now we go back to the other way shanker said its pretty 
clear that if you have two ways of doing things and neither is 
working its time to find a third way 
that third way in shankers view might include ideas unions 
have traditionally opposed including the use of parttime teachers 
a shortage of qualified math and science teachers has made the use 
of parttimers a viable approach that labor should support although 
those teachers are unlikely to join the union shanker said 
we have to encourage nontraditional methods said shanker 
who has been president of the 690000member aft since 1974 
he carries that approach over to overall union organizing a 
oncemilitant union leader calling on his colleagues to relax the 
standards he says are partly to blame for the declining share of 
unionized workers in the united states 
unions themselves have not adequately recongnized the changing 
of the labor force shanker said its the failure in many cases 
to switch the nature of your appeal fast enough 
as the demographics of the workforce change to include fewer 
workers in highrisk factory jobs and more in whitecollar 
professions unions must change equally fast to appeal to 
professionals shanker said 
included in those changes he said should be new membership 
categories such as associate memberships that would offer workers 
who are not members of a collective bargaining unit some union 
services 
that concept is the subject of a heated internal debate that 
delayed the scheduled release this week of a major report on labor 
organizing hardliners object to the concept of associate 
memberships on grounds that labor is conceding too much in its drive 
to fill up membership rolls 
shanker will get a chance to discuss his proposal to merge the 
labor and education departments with labor secretary elizabeth dole 
on wednesday when they visit a dade county school that is part of a 
highly successful pilot program that gives teachers a say in school 
budgets and management 
i think we have to treat these kids as though they are 
workers shanker said we need to create the perception that 
school is a good place for them

amnesty international appealed to the bulgarian 
government tuesday for information about ethnic turks imprisoned 
mainly for peacefully opposing a forced assimilation campaign 
the londonbased human rights group said some members of 
bulgarias turkish minority have been jailed on terrorism or 
espionage charges for protesting a namechanging policy which took 
effect four years ago and some have been tortured 
many were among hundreds arrested in 1984 and early 1985 for 
resisting or protesting the assimilation campaign which restricted 
language and religion and forced turks to give up their islamic 
names 
the bulgarian authorities have charged many with criminal 
charges like terrorism or hooliganism but amnesty international 
believes that the real reason for their imprisonment may be their 
nonviolent opposition to the assimilation campaign the report 
said 
in addition an increase in independent human rights activities 
in the past year has been followed by a crackdown on activists 
amnesty warned in a report 
amnesty international said bulgaria ratified in 1970 the 
international covenant on civil and political rights which 
guarantees free expression association and movement 
amnesty international is calling on the government to end 
violations of these basic rights it said in the report 
the group seeks information on more than 150 prisoners mostly 
from the 900000strong ethnic turkish minority which makes up about 
10 percent of the population said the report 
since 1984 the bulgarian government has denied that a turkish 
minority exists in the country it also says there are no human 
rights abuses 
ahmed hasanov aptullov a 29yearold philosophy lecturer from 
sofia university and three others were arrested after producing 
leaflets in 1986 rallying turks to oppose the assimilation amnesty 
international said 
they were imprisoned for eight to 10 years each amnesty 
international considers them prisoners of conscience the human 
rights groups term for people who use nonviolent means to express 
themselves 
the report described in detail the cases of 11 prisoners of 
conscience and said amnesty international seeks information on 
another 144 prisoners 
the group said another prisoner of conscience ismail mehmedov 
hyuseinov was arrested in 1985 for refusing to accept his new name 
and applying to emigrate to turkey 
he was badly beaten in prison but released to internal exile 
after losing 88 pounds on a hunger strike the government said he 
was freed in 1987 but amnesty international said it has been told 
he remains in exile in northwest bulgaria 
other prisoners have been tortured by prolonged beating on the 
soles of the feet the report said 
amnesty international said it has long been concerned about 
prisoners of conscience in bulgaria and welcomed the recent 
dialogue begun with the bulgarian government 
it said bulgarian authorities supplied information in 1987 after 
repeated requests by amnesty international the group met with some 
officials including a newly formed committee on human rights in 
1988 
the report said concerns remain and reliable information has been 
scarce because of censorship and contradictory official statements 
name changes have made identification difficult

president bush preparing tuesday to visit 
asia defended japans right to invest in the united states despite 
indications that many americans consider tokyo a greater threat than 
the kremlins military power 
meanwhile bushs national security adviser brent scowcroft 
said the president intends to use his fiveday trip to japan china 
and south korea that starts wednesday to underscore that the 
united states is an asian power 
brushing aside a suggestion that bush is taking off on his first 
overseas voyage before he has put in place a cohesive foreign 
policy scowcroft said the president is not trying to make quick 
headlines but instead wants to shape policies that will aid us 
in where we think wed like to be at the end of the century 
scowcroft made public an ambitious agenda of a dozen 1530 minute 
meetings in tokyo between bush and kings presidents and prime 
ministers from around the world who will join in attending the 
funeral of emperor hirohito who died jan 7 more than 150 
countries will be represented at the funeral 
bush asked at a news conference how he would reassure americans 
who think the japanese are buying and are owning too much of the 
united states economy pointed out that japanese investment in 
this country ranks third behind that of britain and the netherlands 
bush said he reassures worried americans by telling them that 
it is important if we believe in open markets that people be allowed 
to invest here just as id like to see more openness for american 
investors in other countries 
bush suggested that japans purchase of us government bonds 
helped this countrys finances we have horrendous deficits and 
foreign capital joins domestic capital in financing those 
deficits he said 
bush said the united states must do more to remove barriers in 
foreign markets to american goods 
a washington postabc news poll published tuesday said that more 
than 40 percent of those who responded in the telephone survey of 
1512 adults said they saw japans economic power a greater threat 
than the soviets military power 
scowcroft said bush will take advantage of the presence of over 
60 heads of government or state to hold discussions with as many as 
time permits 
he ticked off scheduled meetings with the leaders of egypt 
israel jordan singapore pakistan thailand west germany france 
belgium turkey brazil and nigeria and said more may be added 
many of those countries have pressing problems the brazilian 
economy for example is strained by debts owed to us banks and 
the japanese scowcroft did not predict any agreements as a result 
of the talks but he said the mere act of personal contact at the 
top could ease the way for future agreements 
what id like to underscore is the importance here not with 
how long the meets necessarily are and how much substance but the 
significance of a facetoface opportunity to get at least out on 
the table a few issues for discussion he said thats very 
very important and it eases the sense of communication between 
countries after that if youve had this kind of personal contact

military officers plotted for months 
to oust president ferdinand marcos and sped up their plans after the 
public was angered by cheating in the 1986 election against corazon 
aquino a leading conspirator said wednesday 
navy capt rex robles said reformminded officers initially 
planned to establish a transitional council to run the country until 
new elections could be held later they threw their support to mrs 
aquino 
in an interview with radio station dzrh robles said the reform 
the armed forces movement planned to move against marcos in december 
1985 but postponed their move after he called a snap election 
for the following february 
so we decided to postpone until sometime after elections 
around april or may in the summer robles said when there was a 
backlash against cheating in the elections we accelerated it 
robles made the remarks on the third anniversary of a military 
mutiny when officers led by thendefense minister juan ponce enrile 
and thenvice chief of staff lt gen fidel ramos announced they 
were breaking with marcos 
that triggered a massive popular uprising during which hundreds 
of thousands of civilians poured into the streets to defend the 
mutineers against marcos troops marcos fled manila three days 
later for exile in hawaii 
enrile and ramos declared their support for mrs aquino both she 
and marcos claimed victory in the elections of feb 7 1986 which 
the roman catholic hierachy and foreign observers said were marked 
by unprecedented fraud 
our plan was if we succeeded in ousting marcos or asking him to 
step down we would set up a transition council either five to 
seven members robles said our agreement was whoever joined the 
transition council would not run in the election which we would hold 
because it would be unfair 
robles did not explain why the officers dropped the transitional 
council in favor of mrs aquino the reform movement included former 
lt col gregorio gringo honasan sought in the violent august 
1987 attempt to topple mrs aquino 
movement members frequently have complained that they were never 
given credit for their role in ousting marcos 
in the interview robles said marcos found out about the plot but 
was uncertain when it was to be launched robles said the 
conspirators leaked a series of possible dates to confuse marcos 
supporters and force them into a series of security alerts

newly elected state rep david dukes 
opponent filed a court motion tuesday seeking to block the former ku 
klux klan grand wizard from taking the legislative seat he won last 
saturday 
the motion filed by homebuilder john treen asks that dukes 
candidacy be declared illegal because he lives outside the new 
orleans district that elected him state law requires a oneyear 
district residency by candidates 
district judge clarence mcmanus said he was studying the request 
and probably would decide the matter wednesday morning 
duke said late tuesday that he met the residency requirements 
in every respect its a frivolous challenge duke has said he 
has proof he lived in the district a nearly allwhite bedroom 
community of new orleans 
earlier tuesday state gop legislative leaders said duke probably 
would be accepted by republicans as one of their own if hes seated 
in the house when it convenes for a special session wednesday a 
freshman independent had said he would raise the residency issue 
but democrats and republicans alike had said they didnt expect the 
move to succeed 
both duke and treen ran as republicans 
treens motion filed along with a district resident asks that 
treen be declared the winner according to the motion duke listed a 
home address outside the district when he qualified as a democratic 
primary candidate for president on jan 15 1988 and for state 
primaries 
the motion also asked for a temporary restraining order 
forbidding the secretary of state from certifying duke as the winner 
until mcmanus decides whether duke fulfilled the residency 
requirements 
however the secretary of states office certified the results 
tuesday after jefferson parish registrar sam altobello officially 
counted the votes from saturdays race and found dukes 227vote 
margin of victory intact 
duke gave the thumbs up and smiled broadly tuesday at the 
announcement 
im just really proud to live in america duke said im 
also looking forward to an end to the hoopla 
im anxious to meet with the legislators he said i have a 
lot to learn 
if the republican legislative caucus lets him in duke will be 
one of 18 republicans in the 105member house there are six 
republicans in the 39member senate 
also tuesday republican national chairman lee atwater softened 
his aggressive campaign to drive duke from the party saying he 
feared such a public forum might be exactly what the man wanted 
republican legislators tuesday said they saw no reason to reject 
duke from the caucus despite atwaters repudiation of him as a 
charlatan the legislature convenes in special session wednesday 
to take up tax issues 
rep odon bacque of lafayette said monday he intended to 
challenge duke on grounds that he did not live in his district for 
the required year 
we will see if mr duke is what he says he is or what the media 
says he is said rep peppi bruneau of new orleans gop caucus 
chairman if hes what he says he is he has no problem he got to 
the house the same way everybody else did 
there is at least one precedent for a state legislature refusing 
to seat a member because of his views said dan oconnor of atlanta 
a spokesman for the southern legislative conference of the council 
of state governments 
julian bond was barred from taking a seat in the georgia 
legislature in january 1966 because of his opposition to the vietnam 
war the us supreme court in december 1966 said bond had to be 
seated since the only issue was his political views 
both president bush and former president reagan endorsed treen in 
the runoff election after duke won atwater vowed to have duke 
censured and barred from using the gop name 
a resolution is expected to be adopted by the partys 11member 
executive council which will confer by telephone friday 
at a brief news conference tuesday bush conceded his involvement 
might have been viewed by louisiana voters as improper or 
overkill 
duke 38 registered as a republican days before filing as a 
candidate he left the klan in 1980 but remains the president of the 
national association for the advancement of white people which he 
describes as a civil rights group for everyone 
im certainly not the david duke i was during my years in the 
klan but im certain ive grown like all people do mentally 
spiritually he said at a news conference tuesday in baton rouge 
i believe in the civil rights of all people i think the criticism 
ive endured will be muted by my activities in the house of 
representatives 
we cant be responsible for what he did before he was 
registered as a republican said rep art sour a republican i 
dont understand what atwater is talking about censure him for 
what the only control we have over him is what hes done since hes 
been a republican 
democratic rep ron gomez legislative party leader said he 
hoped duke would be seated without problems 
if anyone wanted to challenge duke they should have done so 
when he qualified as a candidate he said

los angeles the grammys return to los angeles after being wined 
and dined last year in new york and the word is out the city of 
angels is going to have to show the music academy an especially good 
time 
the grammy awards and the emmy awards and the academy awards 
they just kind of come and go and los angeles does its thing said 
michael greene president of the national academy of recording arts 
and sciences 
but that laidback attitude is disappearing after the awards show 
won the keys to the city in new york last year mayor ed koch said 
he would like the music folks back in the big apple at least every 
other year 
what we tried to do was turn a onenight event into a four or 
five evening event to encourage people to come to the city said 
jonathan tisch chairman of the new york host committee for the 1988 
grammy awards 
there is a lot of prestige but you certainly cannot ignore the 
financial aspect said tisch president and chief executive 
officer of loews hotels 
he estimated grammy visitors and the television show brought 
about 40 million to the city 
there were some very interesting and culturally lifting 
moments and that was one of the things that new york really 
provided it makes the nominees feel really special greene said 
recently 
for the first time los angeles has countered new yorks 
hospitality with its own friendship campaign consisting of several 
events revolving around wednesdays awards ceremony 
this years threehour awards show will be broadcast live on cbs 
beginning at 8 pm est top nominees include folk singer tracy 
chapman with six nominations and jazz vocalist bobby mcferrin with 
five the shows host will be comedian billy crystal 
the awards are voted by the los angelesbased academys 6000 
members for the best musical performances and songwriting this is 
the 31st year for the awards and the show has been held in los 
angeles every year except five 
this year the los angeles welcomes the grammy awards committee 
a panel of business leaders selected by mayor tom bradley is 
overseeing receptions and making sure the grammy folks are welcome 
in los angeles 
its the same formula used by bradley to attract the olympics to 
los angeles in 1984 
what we see is a foundation for building a longerterm 
relationship said james l stewart executive director of the 
grammy committee which has raised 200000 from businesses to pay 
several events 
stewart said the academys directors decide where to hold the 
awards ceremony and none of the possible host cities have a chance 
to make bids 
the committees events included a grammys in the schools program 
held friday at hamilton high school where a music academy attracts 
students from all over the 300squaremile los angeles school 
district performers included composerconductor henry mancini jazz 
drummer stix hooper and tonight show saxophonist peter 
christlieb 
a grammy night on the town on sunday showcased jazz in the city 
of angels with performances throughout the city by benny carter and 
his trio trumpeter dizzy gillespie singer billy eckstine and art 
blakey and the jazz messengers 
during a gala reception monday at the gene autry western heritage 
museum the music academys presidents award was given to autry 
stewart said the host committee representing the city but not 
funded by it made political sense 
an activity like the committee most people would not 
consider that to be an appropriate public funds expenditure he 
said but bringing together the civic leadership of this city to 
do something like this is highly appropriate 
no matter what los angeles does to make the grammy guests and 
show feel welcome in the city greene has made it clear he is 
ambivalent about where the show should be held 
as far as the show itself los angeles and new york are each 
centers of music centers of culture greene said we dont have 
a problem booking the show at either location

more forcefully to keep criminals off the streets 
the student leaders told reporters that a university employee 
whom they identified as carlos yepez perez was killed in cross fire

rescuers used a helicopter 
bulldozers and bridgebuilding equipment in an unsuccessful search 
tuesday for the eight people aboard an air force cargo plane that 
crashed and burned in a swamp 
an officer who waded through 5footdeep water to reach the site 
said no bodies were found and it was unlikely anyone could have 
survived 
from the looks of it thats the conclusion any reasonable 
person would draw said col howard oakes commander of eglin air 
force base in the florida panhandle 
the fourengine c141b jet based at norton air force base at san 
bernardino calif crashed monday night about four miles north of 
hurlburt field while on its landing approach

bulldozers and other heavy machinery to build a halfmile dirt road 
through the swamp and bridge a creek so vehicles could reach the 
crash site wednesday 
the site is within eglins 720squaremile military reservation 
which is used for training maneuvers and weapons testing 
the c141 location along with heavy rains that have been 
falling since the crash are hampering rescue and recovery efforts 
said technical sgt david torrence an eglin spokesman 
rescuers arrived by climbing down a rope from a hovering 
helicopter or by wading through water and underbrush torrence said 
oakes said the front part of the aircraft was severely damaged 
and its left wing was completely sheared off the rear twothirds of 
the plane was visible but the nose was obscured by thick foliage 
he said 
army rangers who have a camp on the reservation were conducting 
manuevers in the area and were the first to arrive about 30 minutes 
after the crash oakes said 
they saw the fireball he said 
small fires burned hours after the crash no munitions were 
aboard said col dale stovall commander of the 1st special 
operations wing at hurlburt 
an air force safety team is investigating the accident stovall 
said there were severe thunderstorms in the area at the time but he 
declined to say if weather figured in the crash 
the 32 million c141b is capable of carrying up to 200 soldiers 
in combat gear the huge aircraft has a wingspan of 160 feet and is 
168 feet long the only us cargo plane larger than a c141 is the

roof off an elementary school in north carolina causing sewers to 
back up in alabama and dumping still more rain on floodweary 
kentucky and tennessee

twisters in a wide band from the gulf coast states to new england 
with georgia alabama tennessee kentucky and the carolinas the 
hardest hit 
in north carolina a house under construction near lillington 
collapsed in the high winds killing one worker and injuring three

school in morven nc while classes were in session said 
sheriffs dispatcher elaine lear in wadesboro no one was injured 
and pupils were sent home 
we had just had our tornado drill last week so that children

seconds they were perfect you could not ask for them to be any 
better

several small planes at anson county airport four people received 
minor injuries when the wind tossed around trailer homes near eagle 
springs and zions grove said a dispatcher 
up to 3500 customers were without electricity in the rockingham 
and wadesboro areas carolina power and light spokesman kyle hampton 
said 
temperatures reached the high 80s in some florida cities tuesday 
but a cold snap was expected to push readings into the teens by 
wednesday the forecast forced the national weather service to 
cancel its annual statewide tornado drill planned for wednesday 
because severe weather was on the way 
you dont want a test going on when you have the real thing 
said forecaster ray biedinger 
kentucky and tennessee which logged up to 11 inches of rain last

the lebanon junction levee after the rolling fork of the salt river

second man who had been in the van

water levels fall enough for the barges to move under a fixed 
loading spout said port director janet douglas she didnt expect

on higher ground said traffic manager ron edge but the high water 
levels have prevented unloading incoming soybean shipments 
heavy rains blocked sections of at least 170 roads in 56 of 
kentuckys 120 counties on tuesday said don armstrong a spokesman

what if television news had been around to report 
on historic events such as the crusades 
the producers of timeline asked that question and the 
result a sixpart series on pbs premieres tonight 
the answer is it would look pretty dumb 
the series premieres tonight with the crusades 1187 the 
other episodes airing in coming weeks are the black death 
1361 the vikings 1066 the fall of byzantium 1453 
the mongol empire 1247 and granada 1492 
if this is what it takes to make people swallow history lessons 
were doomed anyone dim enough to need former network newsman steve 
bell dressed in medieval costume no less to explain the plague 
in sound bites will sit still only long enough to realize this is 
not the monty python sketch it at first appears then switch to 
whos the boss 
the only immediate use for the sixpart series would seem to be 
presenting it to caged junior high schoolers 
first theres the problem of making what is basically a 
historical documentary look like a news report so there are 
confusing graphics on top of various scenes declaring the footage 
file or live from the year 1187 or whatever of course 
correspondents in period costume with names such as owen of 
canarfon or siboletto of zimbabwe also confuse the viewer since 
they are intercut with interviews with participants in the 
events then if that werent enough were presented with 
explanations of past events that led up to the current 
situation labeled 91 years ago for instance 
the history lesson is perfectly serious even though it seems 
john cleese will appear at any moment but there are lame attempts 
at humor the programs are interrupted occasionally by period 
commercials such as one hawking chimneys a new concept 
the dramatizations are impressive in their careful attention to 
authentic detail in the costumes and sets if not in the rather 
overly enthusiastic acting the series was taped on locations in 
turkey england and spain 
but the programs are extremely wordy the basic problem with 
timeline is that it ultimately is not like television news 
television news would never bombard viewers with so much information

elsewhere in television 
how good is your childrens show youve got a new childrens 
program but you dont know if its good or not what do you do 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television has 
five questions producers and presenters of childrens programming 
should ask themselves 
1 does the program have something to say instead of just 
something to sell 
2 would you submit it to an international animation or film 
festival for an award 
3 would you put it at the top of a list for the lawyer who is 
defending you against a stations challenge 
4 would parents tape it if their children were at the dentist 
5 would you mention it by name if your childs teacher asked you

to lean into the winds of inflation even taking 
the risk that the economy will fall flat on its face to reinforce 
economic reasoning and bolster its strength when political spending 
dreams get out of hand 
these are two of the historic missions of the federal reserve an 
always controversial often misunderstood sometimes misguided 
powerhouse 
it has no set image to some people including the presidents who 
nominate its chairmen it is an arrogant bully to others it is a 
nervous nellie its worryred eyes seeking economic dangers hidden 
from the perception of others 
in this regard it has been accused of removing the punch bowl 
just as the fun begins which is to say that at the height of the 
economic celebration it seeks to keep its head so that everyone can 
drive home safely from the party 
it reports to congress but some congressmen have railed against 
it and had no impact at all it keeps secrets rarely is there a 
leak of inside discussions and seldom does it explain its moves in 
great detail 
oddly the feds reticence gets it more space in the media than 
almost any member of congress or any cabinet officer could command 
it also is the subject of endless speculation in the investment and 
political communities 
generally it maintains an intellectual aloofness from political 
assaults on the other hand it has been accused again and again of 
timing its economic moves to help reelect the incumbent party of 
creating election year booms 
the fed thus has many faces and many images at different times 
but not now seldom has its mission been more explicit it is going 
to face down the threat of inflation by slowing the american 
economys growth rate 
moreover it intends to get the job done before inflation does 
work its way into the economic marrow not forgotten is the 1970s 
experience when the fed for whatever reasons allowed inflation to 
gather such steam it took the highest interest rates of the century 
and a deep recession to stop it 
as usual it has supporters and dissenters and sometimes the two 
are combined wall street is said to gain confidence from the feds 
position on inflation but some of those wall streeters are 
attracting the money of clients with forecasts of economic growth 
much higher than that prescribed by the fed 
many people including respected economists and even president 
bush feel the inflation danger is overstated by his actions as 
chairman alan greenspan couldnt disagree more relentlessly he 
has forced up interest rates 
such action it often is contended threatens to replace one 
danger inflation with another recession judging by its actions 
the fed agrees that there are indeed two dangers and that recession 
is the more acceptable 
so far the feds antiinflation policy not only hasnt stopped 
the economy in its tracks but hasnt been able to slow the growth 
rate to a target of only 25 percent or thereabouts many economists 
still expect growth of 35 percent this year 
as the fed seems to view the situation growth at 35 percent 
would so stress on the nations plant capacity and labor force in 
both instances compelling the use of the least efficient of each 
that price increases would follow 
but critics as there always are when the fed is involved 
contend that by raising interest rates the fed will force companies 
to forego investments in greater plant capacity and more efficient 
technology and methods

just a 20minute walk east from the spires of 
londons high finance and the dome of st pauls signs of england 
melt away into the sounds and smells of the asian subcontinent 
the mosques wailing call to prayer drowns out the the toll of 
the church bell swishing sari robes replace pinstripes and the 
scents of roast lamb and spice perfume the air in brick lane the 
new world for britains latest immigrants people from 
bangladesh 
since the first bangladeshis stepped off the boats three decades 
ago some 30000 have streamed into this part of londons east end 
like the jews once predominant here they have struggled to learn 
english find shelter and work and preserve their culture 
a century ago brick lane was an area of infamous squalor where 
jack the ripper stalked his victims in world war ii it was heavily 
bombed and soon jews began moving out leaving the lowbuilt houses 
and narrow streets to what has become the largest single 
concentration of britains 160000 bangladeshis 
initially arriving for transient work they have brought 
families built five mosques in a squaremile area of tower hamlets 
borough and opened leather shops and grocery stores filled with 
chutneys and mangoes one mosque used to be a synagogue 
having laid down roots and grown in number the bangladeshis have 
also discovered selfassertiveness and have adopted a higher 
profile in demanding their rights as moslems 
they want more sexual segregation in statefunded schools where 
their children are in the majority as well as government money for 
their private schools 
salman rushdies novel the satanic verses became an issue in 
midfebruar among the bangladeshis 
not all supported ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis call to kill 
rushdie and his publishers but they were vociferous in denouncing 
the novel as an insult to their faith islam 
in many ways the issue wasnt about rushdies book said iqbal 
wahhab editor of the asian herald an englishlanguage weekly 
it was about the reassertion of moslem values onto british 
society which they feel have been ignored 
the bangladeshis have begun to shed the immigrant mentality and 
think of england as home 
five 10 years ago our people send all money to bangladesh and 
think im just working here said siraz miah a 28yearold 
whose tiny leather factory is up a narrow staircase strewn with 
leather scraps 
now we think its our country now people have house and 
business now is better 
his 12 workers stitch 300 jackets a week on old sewing machines 
surrounded by headhigh piles of hide and the acrid smell of 
chemicals they are among the fortunate twentyseven percent of 
east end bangladeshis are jobless 
it was factories like this that prompted prince charles during a 
1987 visit to liken brick lanes workplaces to subcontinent 
sweatshops 
something must be done said the heir to the british throne and 
the business community responded with 15 million pounds 26 
million in donations for jobcreation projects 
syed bodrul islam who works the tower hamlets center for small 
business a jobpromotion agency says his focus is with the younger 
generation like miah 
a former social worker islam helps his clients apply for 
interestfree loans for businesses ranging from shops to market 
stalls 
many were not educated even in bangladesh he added but 
the younger generation are very important 
the old people who came years ago have a lot of problems they 
cant read or write some came over with 5000 or 6000 
pounds 9000 to 17000 in 1960 
arriving mostly from the sylhet region of bangladesh formerly 
east pakistan many early settlers were ships cooks with few 
skills and little english who came alone intending to return home 
someday 
families followed sometimes nearly a decade later because of 
britains tightening immigration laws and a community grew now 
their children speak with cockney accents 
we have heard that moslem girls choose boyfriends freely and go 
to discos its worrying us what comes next said daslimali a 
leader of the east london mosque near brick lane 
others trust the collective identity forged in brick lane to 
teach the children 
nowadays lots of bangladeshis are here so our children know 
how we behave said taiyabur rahman 55 who came in 1959 to open 
the first bangladeshi travel agency in london 
as long as our children are with us they wont be lost 
but while life improves problems remain 
racist violence a threat wherever britains 800000 asian 
immigrants are clustered is acute in tower hamlets the tower 
hamlets association for racial equality says it received about 2500 
complaints of racial harassment in 1987 mostly over beatings and 
broken windows it reported seven arson attacks on asian homes none 
of which caused injuries 
speaking little english and a dialect that has no written form 
immigrants are often cut off from police jobs and social services 
with a birthrate five times above the national average men must 
feed five to seven mouths on the lowest average wage of any ethnic 
minority in britain a 1987 house of commons report said 
but it noted the strengths of the community particularly its 
culture and extent of selfhelp within families 
the district still has a few reminders of its jewish past an 
allnight bagel shop or the j minsky and sons textile store but 
the jews do not seem bitter about the newcomers 
sidney minsky whose father started the business in 1902 eagerly 
shows a visitor around asian stores in old tenements 
the asians show you how a business can be run he said

this is as remote a 
place as you can get in africa the largescale map of the bayanga 
region shows only primeval forest crossed by rivers with not a 
single paved road 
in this heart of darkness hundreds of miles from the nearest 
village mans closest relative in the animal kingdom the lowland 
gorilla has found his last refuge a sanctuary of sorts from pygmy 
tribes and others who hunt him for his flesh and his hide 
the gorilla is an endangered species and theoretically under 
tough protection in the central african republic but the government 
has neither the money nor the personnel to enforce the protective 
laws 
there are two main groups of gorillas in africa the mountain 
gorilla in rwanda and eastern zaire whose habitat and life style 
have been fully explored and the lowland gorilla who remains 
largely a mystery 
the mountain gorilla can be seen from peak to peak and gradually 
allows himself to be approached as he becomes familiar with human 
beings 
the lowland gorilla is supremely shy and elusive explains 
richard w carroll of the yale university school of forestry and 
environmental studies in new haven conn 
carroll who has made the gorilla his lifes work rarely gets 
close enough to strike up an acquaintance in more than five years 
work almost exclusively concentrated on the lowland gorilla carroll 
has yet to get one accustomed to the human presence in the forest 
he estimates that a desolate area of 40000 square miles of 
forest where the central african republic cameroon and the congo 
meet may still have at least 90000 gorillas permanently settled 
there with the exception of rare logging camps along he rivers 
there is no human activity in this area and the gorillas have until 
recently remained undisturbed 
in recent years the logging camps have developed and there has 
been heavy illegal poaching for meat and the ivory of elephants 
who are the other main inhabitants of the region 
in the central market in bangui the central african capital 220 
miles to the east stands are piled high smoked monkey meat a local 
delicacy 
gorillas taste like monkeys only better said pierre somse 
who is carrolls pygmy guide and there is more of them 
carroll who lives in bayembe with his wife and 3yearold 
daughter has been trying to teach the pygmies why the gorillas are 
best left alone its an almost hopeless task 
the pygmies go after the gorillas with bows and arrows but 
larger africans those brought in to work the logging camps use 
rifles and even machine guns carroll said 
they bribe the pygmies to help them by giving them clothes and 
liquor in some areas we find snares made of cables stolen from the 
logging companies every few yards along trails used by the 
gorrillas 
the gorillas eat the fleshy leaves of the everpresent 
gingerlike aframomum shrub the fruit of tropical trees and the 
eggs of termites 
its quite common to see a 400pound silverback gorilla climb 
more than 100 feet up into the trees to get at the fruit carroll 
said they love that more than anything 
they will even build a nest up in the trees and sleep there 
in some areas on the ground gorilla nests are visible every five 
or six yards but the gorillas scamper away when they sense a human 
being approach 
carroll has been trying to persuade the central african 
government to set up a wildlife reserve in the remote southwestern 
tip of the country but in reality the effort is useless unless the 
other two governments in the area the congo and cameroon cooperate 
meanwhile the poaching goes on even poorly paid wildlife guards 
sometimes find it more worth their while to hunt gorillas and 
elephants and the dense forest paradoxically helps to protect the 
poachers from the guards 
it would help to be able to get a radio tag on the animals 
carroll said we have to crawl on our hands and feet to get close 
to them and even then we dont see them til we are a foot or two 
away with a radio we could find a place ahead of them and watch 
them coming 
he said the gorillas share 90 percent of human genetic materials 
and as such are by far the closest animals to man 
but he deplored the ineffectiveness of the present system of 
control and the inability of local governments and european and 
american organizations to stop the poaching 
recently we were in a camp on the sangha river where it forms 
the border with the congo a congolese gunboat came up the river and 
ordered us to get out of there we were clearly in the car 
central african republic but quite obviously we were interfering 
with their poaching

the green consumer movement is gaining momentum 
in western europe and environmentalism is becoming mainstream 
now many europeans need only to go to the neighborhood 
supermarket if they want organically grown vegetables lowmercury 
batteries or what have become known as environmentfriendly diapers 
and crueltyfree cosmetics those marketed without being tested on 
laboratory animals 
consumers increasingly are demanding products that dont cost 
the earth and companies are seizing the new opportunity experts 
say 
people realize that by exercising choice on the high street 
main street they can change the way the environment is treated 
said virginia bottomley a british environment official 
theres a growing acceptance that we cant go on using and 
destroying the worlds natural resources 
she was one of 11 speakers at a recent london conference of 
officials from government industry and environmental groups called 
attracting the green consumer 
robin sadler an advertising consultant told the conference 
green issues are not just flavor of the month this could become 
the worlds central project for the next century 
here are just some of the steps governments have taken 
the 12nation european economic community and 23 other countries 
have committed themselves to cutting back the use of cfcs or 
chlorofluorocarbons by 50 percent by the end of the century cfcs 
used as propellants are thought to deplete the earths protective 
ozone shield 
italy plans a 100lire 8cent tax on consumers for each 
nonbiodegradable plastic bag they take from the store 
the netherlands is offering tax breaks to people who buy cars 
that meet strict antipollution standards 
west germany for years has put blue angel labels on products 
that meet its environmental standards the scandinavian countries 
the netherlands france japan and canada are following suit 
queen elizabeth ii has switched her fleet of cars to leadfree 
gasoline and her son prtince charles has banned aerosol sprays from 
his home 
green consumerism offers many opportunities to companies but 
confronts them with a complex market the experts said 
the highest levels of concern are shown by the more affluent 
groups of society said dorothy mackenzie a marketing expert but 
there are lots of different green consumers they are motivated by 
different concerns and have widely different patterns 
they range from 1960sstyle hippies and currentday guppies 
green yuppies to mothers concerned about their childrens future 
she said 
the green opportunities mean companies can make money directly 
by selling green products as well as indirectly by enhancing their 
reputation 
our reputation clearly helps our business said john hume 
director of johnson wax ltd the british subsidiary of the 
similarly named us household products maker his company removed 
cfcs from its aerosols in 1986 a costly exercise and labels 
products environmentfriendly 
disposable diapers are one of the latest products to go green and 
earn the reputation of being environmentfriendly procter and 
gamble joining other companies is selling chlorinefree diapers in 
six countries the chlorineprocessed diapers contain tiny residues 
of the highly poisonous chemical dioxin 
safeway plc no relation to the us supermarket chain has 
removed contentious or detrimental ingredients from its own 
products such as artificial color in its ownbrand orange soda 
it also recycles its cardboard and offers its customers free 
recycled paper bags it has built a cfcfree refrigeration center in 
scotland 
the british confectioner cadbury ltd is among companies that 
have opted for a link with a worthy cause in 1985 it began donating 
a percentage of sales of a chocolate wildlife bar to the world 
wildlife fund to help endangered animals the animals are depicted 
on the bars labels 
research has found that consumers are willing to pay more for 
environmentfriendly products 
marek mayer an expert on environmental issues said some west 
german retailers are believed to charge more for products that carry 
the blue angel label even though some of these products are 
cheaper to make 
julia hailes coauthor of the green consumer guide said 
green products initially will cost more but their prices will 
decline as they are massproduced 
despite green consumerisms growing momentum both consumers and 
companies remain reluctant to embrace it wholeheartedly the experts 
said 
organic produce still represents less than 5 percent of safeways 
total produce sales said tony combes a director the governments 
mrs bottomley lamented that only 2 percent of the auto fuel 
consumed in britain is unleaded 
people will not do what they say they do for the environment 
unless its very easy sadler said personal benefit may still be 
the key to adopting green issues the idea of doing something for 
the common good is still not a motivation for people yet 
unfortunately 
the experts said the threat of consumer criticism is very real 
theres a very great danger that we could have an inconsistency 
here of polluting the environment while producing green products 
hume said for instance he added leadfree gas might reduce air 
pollution but its manufacture produces at least one highly toxic 
byproduct 
walter guthrie a manager at boots microcheck group a chemicals 
maker said some manufacturers have made preservativefree claims 
when the product didnt need to be preserved in the first place 
these attempts to mislead the consumer should be actively 
discouraged

three weeks later the television invitation to call carries a 
sotto voce addendum ten dollars a call 
this particular operation is offered by one of a group of 
companies known usually as omni phone inc of seattle although in 
texas the name is hdl inc the marketing and promotion is handled by 
a firm called the megaquest group based in seattle the companies 
employ about 500 people and operate in about 30 cities domestically 
plus all of canada and in london rotterdam paris and australia 
one of the satellite companies phonequest was the one that 
engineered the santa calling show it was syndicated to 30 domestic 
and four foreign markets when the seattle station began getting 
irate calls it quickly ran a warning to children with the printed 
words telling them to ask mom and dad first why did phonequest 
which has used the program for four years rely on the electronic 
dialing technique a spokesman said it was to prevent children from 
dialing the wrong number 
when one of the firms 970 numbers in new york city was dialed 
and reached after several abortive tries a pretentiously sexy 
female voice answered and offered to be companionable when the 
phone bill came in it registered four calls and two additional 
minutes the charge was 7980 even though three of the calls never 
produced an answer when the number was called back post billing 
this was the conversation 
hi welcome to party line 
how much does this call cost 
you didnt hear the recording 
there was no recording 
nineteen ninetyfive 
goodbye 
that number also was advertised on television with an attractive 
young woman adding under her breathless message 1995 a call 
it so happened that particular number was another omni phone 
enterprise betsy superfon known erroneously in the trade as 
betsy superphone is chief executive officer of the 
seattlebased firm 
she says the company offers everything from soap opera updates to 
joke lines from dialaninsult to group access lines she outlined 
plans to go into other areas with information storage and retrieval 
via voice a kind of telephone postal service as well as 
interconnections between computers and varying menues available on 
a single line to get specific data for instance in sports that the 
caller desires 
there is also a proposal to acquire her firm from herself and 
partners joel and rebecca eisenberg they claim a 1987 net income of 
not less than 4 million the wouldbe acquirer is a texas firm 
called wurltech industries of houston which is listed on the new 
york stock exchange as a billiard table manufacturer it was 
recently quoted at about a dollar a share 
of the unanswered but chargedfor calls ms superfon said she 
would refund any justifiable costs on receipt of a complaining 
letter she said there is a quality control program to prevent such 
errors 
would she continue the current gab line and adult services in 
light of her future plans 
absolutely people are lonely have been lonely and always will 
be lonely 
besides for many people the phone lines provide a real service 
for companionship even though many of the people who link up by 
voice rarely see each other telephones are really safe she 
says 
there is already the beginning of a second generation of 
telephoneline dating from new york city comes word of a fax 
or facsimiletransmitter club which for a few hundred dollars will 
let you fax your message to someone elses fax and never hear their 
voice if you dont want to 
industrywide most dialit entrepreneurs would talk only on a 
notforattribution basis 
chris elwell editor of the information industry bulletin one of 
the few authoritative sources in the dialit industry says using 
the telephone for information is nothing new new york telephone 
operators have been giving the time of day since the late 1920s 
with the weather and traffic information following the old operator 
and the party line were avenues for news and gossip 
advertising is a major expense for todays purveyors small 
operations rely on wordofmouth and matchbook covers to pass on

bigger operators use television evening television movies are 
interrupted with all kinds of invitations sometimes attractive 
young women purring theres a party on your line whenever you 
want call as often as you want 
businesses that deal in sex have never been known for truth in 
advertising but the expansion and invasion of the information 
telephone services sanctioned by state and local authorities is 
becoming troublesome to many 
in california the state legislature and the public service 
commission made it mandatory for the telephone company to block 
lines to such calls at the customers request pacific bell has a 
suit pending against a dozen dialaporn operators to force them to 
cease and desist on the basis that they are damaging pacific bells 
reputation 
new york telephone says it makes an effort to survey the talk 
lines and operators are required to provide monitors who can cut off 
disruptive or obscene callers while this works on some lines it 
doesnt seem to work on others 
new york telephone will now block dialit calls from residences 
for free until this january there was a 5 charge businesses must 
pay 10 and up depending on the number of lines 
the company will also cancel the charges the first time if the 
customer complains that a child or teenager made the calls without 
parental permission after that the customer is urged to have the 
line blocked or keep their youngsters off the phone 
the phone company loses nothing it gets half the charge whether 
the dialit service collects or not one west coast company says 
uncollected calls cost it 400000 a year 
southern bell shut down dialaporn services in miami and atlanta 
in 1984 and so far has been upheld by the courts 
the option of blocking calls apparently did not reach vilma 
lantiqua a 49yearold mother of a 17yearold high school dropout 
in new york city her son sergio had run up a 1400 phone bill 
calling various party lines in desperation she put the phone in her 
daughters padlocked bedroom so one night in january sergio broke 
into his mothers bedroom stuffed a sock in her mouth and strangled 
her police said 
the us supreme court has agreed to hear a case this spring in 
which a california dialaporn operator sable communications in the 
los angeles area is challenging bans on dialaporn as abridgements 
of freedom of speech 
the law under contest is a 1988 federal statute that bans 
sexually explicit telephone message services the law prohibits any 
obscene or indecent communications for commercial purposes over 
interstate lines it provides for fines up to 500000 and prison 
terms up to two years 
whatever course the supreme court decides there are a number of 
area phone companies which fearing adverse reaction will affect the 
telephone information business in general are planning to curtail 
or segregate the pornographic and gab lines 
the revenues are important one new york state official said the 
information services help subsidize the general telephone services 
those services which cater to homosexuals are more serious than 
other gab lines they permit callers to talk with a group or 
barhop by pressing a designated key on pushbutton phones one 
operator of such lines says they perform a real service all the 
more critical in the gay community since the aids epidemic 
talking to someone before jumping into bed with him is a good 
thing to do he says gays take this more seriously than do the 
straights who tend to goof off and hambone on the gab lines 
most often dialit profits are illusory a gamble at best 
quality equipment is expensive some devices running 2000 a line 
or more they force a telephone line capable of carrying two 
voices to carry six to eight 
most operations start with bright ideas some never come to 
fruition some fail for lack of continuing innovation it is a 
copycat business some reserved lines are still vacant there are 
thousands more available 
the reason one said is that the field is littered with dead 
bodies lost fortunes yet there are 200 million telephones out 
there each a potential market 
like many new ideas these days this one started in the western 
states ominously that is where some of the harshest controls are 
showing up 
but gab lines are not likely to go away as one frequent caller 
says its cheaper than going out

editors note at costellos restaurant a new york watering 
place where celebrities are legendary herbie has found a home at 
age 83 he is by popular acclaim the worlds worst waiter his 
customers would have it no other way 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
herbie pischler stands at the counter 
motionless his back to the thinning crowd his pencil rests idly on 
his order pad 
is he adding a check figuring his tips no the noonday rush has 
been wearing on herbie he is taking a nap 
give him a moment soon his head will jerk upward and he will 
resume his slow shuffling among the tables at costellos restaurant 
in effortless affirmation of the title his fans have voted him the 
worlds worst waiter 
those who dispute the title point out herbies occasional 
displays of dining room efficiency 
should a customer ask for another roll for example herbie often 
reaches in his pocket where he keeps a supply saving all those 
steps to the kitchen when one customer asked what the creamy stuff 
was on his sandwich herbie scooped up some on his finger and licked 
it butter he said and shuffled on 
the restaurant was founded in 1928 by tim and joe costello irish 
immigrants of happy memory who discovered shortly after stepping 
off the boat that running a speakeasy was more profitable than 
driving a truck 
from the beginning the genial irishmen attracted an assortment of 
new yorkers who appreciated a stalwart drink an uncomplicated menu 
and good cheer 
costellos walls are decorated with original works by americas 
most noted cartoonists beginning with james thurber and its roster 
of regulars over the years included ernest hemingway john 
steinbeck aj liebling charles addams walt kelly and legions of 
uncelebrated working folk always a most tolerant clientele 
herbie found a home there that was 22 years ago the longest he 
has ever held a job in all that time few have learned his last 
name he is just herbie 
he won the title of worlds worst waiter back in 1974 by popular 
acclaim of awed customers who observed him at work and also learned 
something of his past 
no official document certifies the title but in 15 years no 
challenger has come forward and so the folks at costellos figure it 
is herbies by default a clipping on the wall from a british 
publication is documentation enough that the title is truly 
international 
you will hear no criticism of herbie at costellos instead a 
pastime among a group at the end of the bar is to make side bets on 
whether herbie gets the right order to the right customer without 
accident 
herbies completion rate says tim costello the proprietor 
and son of the founder is about 75 percent 
im not as young as i used to be herbie replies at my age 
youre bound to make a few mistakes 
herbie will be 83 on july 31 he was born in ludwigshafen 
germany where the zeppelin made its appearance at about the same 
time in fact herbie and the zeppelin are of similar design sort 
of eggshaped herbie asleep or awake stands 5foot6 a wizened 
gnome with thin gray hair and hazel eyes 
at 16 he took a job as cabin boy on a german merchant ship and 
made his way to argentina in time he became second steward on the 
presidential yacht docked in buenos aires where his true greatness 
was first noticed 
is the report accurate he was asked that he spilled a bowl of 
soup on the prince of wales who had come aboard for a state dinner 
no says herbie it is not true i spilled the soup on the 
colonel sitting next to him only a little got on the prince 
it was not my fault herbie hastens to add the carpet 
tripped me

jobless herbie wandered around europe and in 1929 came to 
america not a good year to find a job herbie joined the army and 
became a mess cook as they are called in herbies case perhaps 
aptly 
when the depression wound down herbie left the army and resumed 
the career that led to his deserved acclaim 
he began as a dishwasher in new york and worked his way to the 
bottom building an impressive resume 
i worked at the old plaza hotel the ambassador the english 
grill the astor then i went to florida and worked in the fancy 
places at miami beach 
i went to chicago and worked at the edgewater beach hotel i 
worked in west virginia at the greenbrier you know the 
greenbrier 
were you a good waiter herbie 
one of the best you couldnt work at those places unless you 
were one of the best 
were you ever fired 
never never 
why did you move around so much 
when you are young you must move you mustadventure 
did you ever have any noteworthy adventures at any of those 
places 
are you asking did i spill a pot of coffee on that columnist 
guy walter winchell yes i spilled the coffee 
the carpets fault 
the carpets fault 
a few more stains on the linoleum happily costellos has no 
carpet or on herbies pants and shirt sleeves for that matter are 
viewed here merely as badges of honest if at times maladroit labor 
indeed tim costello and his partner pete tully consider herbie 
and his www title as an asset 
it is a rare attitude in this bottomline town where familyowned 
restaurants with individual traditions and values have become almost 
extinct 
since prohibitions repeal in 1933 costellos has had to move 
three times to stay alive but never farther than half a block it 
has been at its present spot at 225 east 44th since 1974 with each 
move its most cherished movable treasures went with it the bar 
the back bar the thurber drawings herbie 
the bar is of cigarettescarred oak rubbed to a warm patina by 
three generations of elbows 
three generations of mementos decorate the back bar above an 
array of bottles rises a clutter of photographs and testimonials 
and above these hang an assortment of gifts from grateful customers 
they include a cavalry saber from the spanish civil war a tc 
branding iron from stanley walker new york editor turned texas 
rancher and the remains of a blackthorn walking stick that 
hemingway broke over the head of john ohara in 1944 not in anger 
but on a bet 
the story from an eyewitness is that ohara claimed blackthorn 
was the only wood that couldnt be broken over an irishmans head 
hemingway bet he could break that very stick over the head of that 
very irishman 
he padded oharas head with napkins laid the stick on the 
napkins and took hold of each end brace yourself john he 
said and pulled down until the stick cracked 
at costellos legends abound 
herbie the worlds worst waiter is already one of them

editors note americas love affair with the robot apparently 
has gone sour orders for the mechanical marvels have been on the 
decline in recent years after reaching a peak in 1984 one reason 
is robots are still pretty dumb and corporations are hesitant to 
invest large amounts of money to develop smarter models 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
scientists in the 1950s proclaimed the robot 
the wave of the future it would free housewives of drudgery and 
fill factories with a tireless steelcollar work force but in many 
ways the wave has been a washout 
robots can paint cars salvage nuclear fuel and even assist in 
brain surgery but theyre still pretty dumb and they are far from 
the science fiction promise of comic books and movies 
robots now are significantly better than 30 years ago but that 
doesnt necessarily mean we are anywhere close to an r2d2 or 
c3po says raj reddy director of the robotics institute at 
carnegie mellon university referring to the robot characters in the 
movie star wars 
orders for americanmade robots have been falling since their 
peak of 501 million in 1984 according to the robotics industries 
association 
experts say automating a factory is more complicated than just 
buying a robot and putting it on the assembly line in addition 
they say some industrial robots are too complicated and prone to 
failure and when they do work they dont always fit in with 
factory operations 
about 33000 robots work in the united states mostly in 
manufacturing with automakers buying at least 40 percent says 
robots association spokesman jeffrey a burnstein 
its not a revolution its an evolution burnstein says 
robots are another new productive technology in the same way that 
computers were 
japan is the worlds leading robot user followed by the united 
states west germany and france 
robots are still dumb reddy says theyre dumb because we 
havent taken the trouble to put the pieces together not because we 
dont know how that takes money and time and effort and we dont 
have the money 
but todays robots can 
see they dont see like humans but they can recognize forms 
and shapes and measure distances through sonar ranging devices and 
lasers 
hear and speak they use computers that recognize thousands of 
words 
smell their sensors can detect smoke or fumes 
move they most often roll on wheels but some models hop on one 
leg and others walk with as many as eight legs ambling like a 
spider on uneven terrain 
touch they can recognize texture and the force of a movement 
such as pressing 
many robots have one or two of these abilities to some degree 
but creating a competent robot that combines most or all of them has 
been difficult 
in addition scientists have found its difficult to match human 
abilities that most people take for granted such as the dexterity 
of a finger or the ability to identify objects 
the rule of thumb is that if you think the job is easy then 
its usually difficult says takeo kanade codirector of the 
carnegie mellon institute the list of things that robots can do 
better than humans is much much shorter than the list of things 
robots cannot 
industrial robots can perform many tedious tasks with precision 
including welding assembling painting packaging and loading yet 
burnstein estimates that less than 5 percent of american companies 
have installed even one robot 
japanese companies which have installed more than twice as many 
robots as american companies have been more willing to invest in 
robots that take years to pay for themselves burnstein says 
robots are very expensive to make and they can do very 
little says hans moravec senior research scientist at carnegie 
mellon its hard to find a job for them that actually pays off 
moravec says the industrial robot is about as smart as an insect 
the robots working on the assembly line today might well be 
compared to spiders he says they do their jobs competently 
but its a narrow job 
industrial robots often shut down when even the slightest thing 
goes wrong forcing humans to their aid says donald michie chief 
scientist of the turing institute of glasgow scotland which 
conducts research into artificial intelligence

michie is trying to develop computers that learn from experience 
a technology that could result in robots that adjust to changing 
circumstances and learn from mistakes 
moravec believes technology will enable robots to have humanlike 
intelligence in about 50 years 
service robots a new breed are moving off the factory floor to 
handle work in hazardous environments help the disabled or just 
sweep floors underwater robots are examining lake bottoms and doing 
risky deepsea work 
doctors at memorial medical center of long beach calif have 
performed more than 35 brain operations with the help of a robot arm 
that guides surgeons as they drill into the skull 
research is under way at carnegie mellon on a sixlegged robot to 
explore the surface of mars in the next decade and on a car that can 
drive itself university researchers also made robots to remove 
radioactive waste from the crippled three mile island nuclear plant 
near harrisburg 
kg engelhardt director of the universitys health and human 
services lab is developing a robotic work station that allows the 
disabled especially those without the use of their hands to work 
in an office the station should be marketed by the end of the year 
selling for less than 50000 she says 
tish pferdehirt 44 a vocational rehabilitation counselor in 
pittsburgh helps test the station with paralyzed legs and only 
limited use of her arms she knows firsthand the benefits of such a 
helpmate 
it does all kinds of things from getting a book off a shelf for 
me to turning off a radio to picking up a file and putting it in 
an inout box she says 
the work station has an arm that turns bends and swivels as ms 
pferdehirt speaks commands into a microphone it fetches things 
looks up telephone numbers and dials the phone 
ms engelhardt hopes to make the robot work on projects 
independently such as shredding paper when she is not there thus 
making it more valuable 
joseph f engelberger has big corporate backers for his service 
robots 
projects in the works at engelbergers transitions research corp 
of danbury conn include development of robots that will sweep or 
scrub floors in airports or supermarkets and fetch drugs for 
pharmacists in mailorder warehouses 
another engelberger robot is helpmate a nurses aide that 
delivers meals to hospital patients and makes other deliveries such 
as taking a urine specimen to a lab 
helpmate designed to use elevators and negotiate hallways as it 
moves by itself on wheels is being tested and engelberger said it 
will go on sale for 40000 by years end 
engelberger hopes to get corporate backing to build his dream 
robot a 50000 household helper that would prepare light meals 
clean house and clear snow but he cant figure out how to teach it 
to make beds 
he estimates it would take up to 14 million and 2 years to 
develop but american companies so far have been unwilling to make 
the initial investment 
engelberger helped pioneer an industrial robot more than 30 years 
ago but the history of the automaton goes back farther 
the whole idea of building a mechanical man is fairly old 
moravec says there were clockwork automatons built by swiss and 
french clocksmiths in the 18th century and 17th century 
the term robotics was coined in 1942 in a science fiction story 
by isaac asimov from the word robot which was coined in 1921 by 
czech playwright karel capek 
in 1954 american inventor george devol filed a patent for a 
programmable robot arm whose movement was controlled by punched 
program cards in 1958 devol and engelberger formed a company to 
build the machines 
their first industrial robot was installed in 1961 in a general 
motors corp plant 
engelberger says visions in the 1950s of a robotfilled world 
fizzled when the promises outran technology 
everything was supposed to become automated he says it 
was all blue sky but the technology wasnt available the 
technology is just becoming available but i have a difficult time 
convincing people we can do it today

editors note for centuries they were the playgrounds of the 
rich but in recent years the lavish health spas of west germany 
have depended mainly on the aging and infirm who could take the 
waters at government expense now the pendulum is swinging again and 
guess who gave it a big push healthconscious yuppies known among 
germans as schickimickis have discovered the spa scene 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
west germanys mostfamous 
health spas like this 19th century playground for the rich royal 
and renowned are enjoying a renaissance among an emerging class of 
european yuppies 
take a look and get looked at is one of the advertising 
slogans luring a hedonistic crowd into the spa social scene that for 
the past 30 years has been dominated by the weak and aging 
in a period of federal belttightening the resorts that in the 
postwar years have focused on governmentsponsored health care are 
now turning back to the healthy and wealthy who bestowed their 
original fame 
a modest trimming of social security benefits that took effect 
with the new year promises to cut into the ranks of 84 million 
cure guests who take the waters each year in west germany 
but administrators of the most distinguished baths say they had 
long been expecting fiscal conservatism to catch up with the cushy 
health care system 
some like baden baden bad aachen and wiesbaden have begun 
catering to a new generation of guests a younger crowd of 
wellheeled professionals known among germans as schickimickis 
sequined and tuxedoed the elite envoys of the 30to40 set 
saunter and gamble in the path of feodor dostoevski and kaiser 
wilhelm in baden badens glittering casino dwindling in number are 
the elderly and ailing bingo players in an adjacent parlor of the 
kurhaus 
a sprawling sevenpool glassenclosed bathing temple 
completed three years ago draws 1500 guests a day increasingly 
from among younger couples and singles who come here for long 
weekends to play tennis relax and flaunt their newfound prosperity 
hans berg manager of the german bathing association office in 
bonn says the spas are attracting a broader group of guests and 
becoming less dependent on the publicly insured clientele 
under the 1956 legislation that set up todays elaborate social 
security net west germans are entitled to a spa treatment as often 
as every three years if their doctors recommend it 
until this year the federally funded health insurance network 
paid the full cost of a three or fourweek bathing cure for those 
recuperating from illness or taking a respite from the stresses of 
work or family life 
cure clients must now pay 10 percent of the cost of their 
treatments which run an average of 2750 for four weeks plus most 
of their hotel and food expenses 
we dont know exactly what effect the changes in the law will 
have on the industry and we hope this isnt too strong a blow 
berg says but we have been enjoying a steady growth over the past 
year or two of younger visitors and by younger i mean those in 
their 30s who want to go away for a few days for a small vacation 
rather than a cure 
josef bartholemy baden badens spa association general manager 
contends the cutbacks are shortsighted 
some of those who would benefit from rest and recuperation will 
put off taking a cure because of the expense then end up in the 
hospital which will cost more for a few days than a preventative 
cure he says 
but spa administrators expect that a trend among younger germans 
to take better care of their health promises to more than compensate 
for an expected drop in visits by guests on social security 
the changes in our clientele have had a positive economic 
effect says sigrun lang chairwoman of baden badens spa 
association while the guest here for a publicly funded cure is 
often on a restricted budget during his fourweek stay those 
staying for a threeday convention or a long weekend tend to spend a 
lot in the shops and the casino 
a slender 40ish executive mrs lang says the more successful 
spas are cashing in on the younger generations growing absorption 
with health and appearance 
despite a nationwide unemployment rate of 85 percent a new 
affluence is visible among the younger collegeeducated crowd in 
major cities like hamburg and munich and like their baby boom 
contemporaries in the united states west germans in their 30s and 
early 40s are gradually moving into the upper echelons of government 
and industry 
foreign guests continue to account for more than a quarter of the 
spa patronage with wealthy americans arabs japanese and europeans 
replacing the russian nobility of the last century 
fewer turn to the mystic healing effects of water to cure serious 
illnesses these days but the younger generations frequenting the 
spas are bringing along new health challenges for the resorts to 
tackle 
the opulent art deco complex at bad nauheim for example now 
offers a program to break the smoking habit 
bad mergentheim nestled in a scenic valley of vineyards along 
the famous romantic road attracts a new clientele with its 
weightreduction course 
bad aachen at the threenation crossroads with belgium and 
holland where charlemagne took the waters 1200 years ago now 
offers stressmanagement clinics 
managers of smaller spas and the hotels and restaurants supported 
by cure guests are nervous about the effects of the streamlining 
they point out that only a few dozen of the 264 officially 
recognized health spas in west germany are esteemed enough to get by 
on the clientele that pays its own way 
there is no other industry here except the spas says elke 
requeer treatment director at the city cure house in bad 
muenstereifel a scenic hamlet in the foothills of the eifel near 
the border with belgium we dont get a lot of younger visitors 
here because most of our patients are elderly and the atmosphere 
must remain quiet 
school director anita meinhardt of fulda taking a cure at baden 
baden this winter at her own expense said the federal cutbacks are 
unlikely to deter those strongly in need of rest and may encourage 
more personal responsibility about ones health 
referring to her countrymens propensity to drink and smoke more 
than other europeans she contended that one shouldnt expect the 
government to provide an allexpensepaid cure for a lifetime of bad 
living habits

editors note he trudged the frozen wilderness around the great 
lakes in the middle of the 19th century spreading the christian 
religion among the indians while establishing his missions bishop 
frederick baraga also put the spoken tongues of the ottawa and 
ojibwa indians into written words some say he performed miracles 
and for years have been urging the roman catholic church to have him 
canonized as a saint 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
scholars count the miracles and pat and myra 
ellico count the winters as michigans snowshoe priest travels a 
long path toward possible sainthood 
to many around here bishop frederick baraga a roman catholic 
missionary who spent a lifetime converting indians to christianity 
in the 19th century is a saint already they believe canonization 
of baraga is inevitable 
there isnt much doubt in our minds we believe he is a 
saint says the rev guy thoren at the sacred heart church in 
lanse where baraga built his last mission 
thorens mother was part of the first move to canonize baraga 
that began 37 years ago since then the church has approved 
baragas writings and has verified his sanctity now it must accept 
the miracles 
either it will be very soon or it will be an extremely long 
process says regis walling who for five years has gathered 
baraga material and sent it to rome i have no doubt that it will 
happen 
while walling works for the catholic diocese pat and myra ellico 
keep the faith at the baraga shrine in lanse 
the elderly couple sells trinkets to the tourists who stop at the 
shrine to see a 35foot brass and copper statue of the traveling 
priest when they can they sit strangers down over hot tea and 
cookies and tell them of their candidate for sainthood 
baraga was born in 1797 the son of wealthy landowners in 
frenchoccupied slovenia now a part of yugoslavia the young priest 
left a fractured church in his homeland in 1830 to establish 
missions among the ojibwa and ottawa indians in the northwest 
territory 
he spent 23 years among indians and settlers on lakes michigan 
and superior traveling hundreds of miles by canoe snowshoe and 
even ice floe spreading the gospel and putting the ottawa and 
ojibwa tongue into written words 
baraga used the indians as guides he also relied on them as 
rescuers for sometimes he was found to be wandering in circles in 
the winter wilderness 
his feats are legendary to the people of the northern woods 
where a county town and state park are named after him 
the yugoslavian people also remain keenly aware of their native 
son they send representatives to marquette each year for ceremonies 
remembering him 
but baraga sometimes encountered hostility among the native 
americans he worked with their reaction then and now has been 
mixed 
there are those who realize the chippewa ojibwa would have 
moved west or simply disappeared if it hadnt been for him 
walling says he helped save them by giving them a written 
language 
then there are some who feel all white men missionaries 
included led to the destruction of the indian nation actually i 
think the real cause was alcohol 
i guess there is mixed feeling says the rev john hascall a 
catholic priest who is also an ojibwa pipe carrier religious man 
and president of the national takakwitha council based in montana 
missionaries came close to robbing the ojibwa and other indians 
of their native beliefs in god or kije manito the great spirit 
hascall says 
baraga did not understand that he adds he thought he was 
converting pagans

im not demeaning father baraga anybody bringing christ would 
enrich us his every effort was to build us up which he really did 
accidentally by preserving our language he was a man who was 
sincere which made him in the indian way a holy man 
donald lapointe a 58yearold ojibwa grew up with the baraga 
legend handed down from his father and grandfather 
they held him in reverence he says one of my earliest 
memories was seeing a picture of him 
baraga built homes and schools for the ojibwa and purchased 500 
acres of land for the tribe lapointe says just recently the 
keweenaw bay tribe obtained the deed for the land from the marquette 
diocese 
today baragas outpost at lanse is surrounded by an ojibwa 
reservation where children read their history in the language baraga 
penned 
summers at the shrine are crowded with tourists but winter 
leaves the ellicos alone with a friendly doberman pinscher named 
hans and the silent baraga statue shrouded in snow 
schoolchildren come out now and then to burn candles by the 
shrine a state plaque nearby marks an ancient indian trail that 
heads south to wisconsin at least one missionary is believed to 
have died on the frozen path 
this is the time of year the ellicos who have tended the shrine 
for 14 years notice the increasing cold and dream of retiring and 
moving south 
pat and his brother once envisioned a tourist motel and 
restaurant on the bluff overlooking keweenaw bay but his brother 
died and the bishop baraga foundation asked if he would donate land 
for the shrine pat ellico agreed 
artist jack andersons robed priest stands high on a giant 
metallic cloud atop copper arches that end in five tepees one for 
each of the indian missions baraga founded 
to walling baragas own life was the greatest show of divine 
intervention 
that he survived under the conditions he lived that was more 
a miracle than anything else she says he traveled from lanse 
to duluth minn on snowshoes his eyes froze shut and he survived 
with no harm 
walling has given rome other evidence though from there a 
franciscan priest father bruno korosak sends them on to the sacred 
congregation of saints 
there are over 110 very strong cases of miracles or 
intercessions walling says 
one involved baraga county clerk bernard lambert who led the 
effort in the early 1970s to build the baraga shrine thoren says 
lambert who was crippled with arthritis at 28 died last year 
he was totally invalid and then he walked thoren says i 
believe the statue was done in 1971 in thanksgiving 
the catholic community has not waited for rome to begin sending 
prayers to baraga the faithful carefully pass among themselves 
relics of his existence thread from his woolen socks and splinters 
of wood from his burial casket 
a hubbell womans cancer completely vanished after she prayed to 
baraga with thread from his socks in her hands walling says 
my mother had a thread thoren says when my brother became 
a sky diver she gave it to him then he gave it to a friend who was 
dying of cancer 
the cancer victim died but the thread was preserved a precious 
token 
if the miracles are accepted baragas writings must be presented 
in a document that explains the context of his work a process 
walling says is twothirds complete then the real journey begins 
as the vatican considers baraga first for veneration beatification 
and finally canonization

editors note its one of 3000 to 4000 tiny publishing houses 
across the country mom and pop operations that are looking for 
quality not quantity and not expecting to make a lot of money and 
at the holy cow press jim perlman is bullish on imagination 
controversy and minorities

holy cow a oneman publishing house milking 
the midwest for poetry and prose and not pulling for a bestseller 
yep and they call it just that holy cow press 
ask the boss jim perlman the owner publicity agent production 
department accountant and lone editor 
if i really wanted to make a lot of money id publish 
cookbooks selfhelp or a lot of childrens books he says 
instead perlman focuses on the literary works of a select group 
of writers who explore controversial issues and experiment with 
ideas he settled on holy cow as a moniker for its shock value and 
because it reflects the midwestern roots of his writers most of 
whom are women or nonwhite 
i like risktaking says perlman who works out of his rented 
home i still think that poetry is where important new 
groundbreaking philosophies are going to come out 
the minneapolis native founded the press in 1977 between stints 
as a student at the university of arizona and the university of 
iowa in august he moved the business to duluth where his wife 
deborah petersenperlman works as a communications professor at the 
university of minnesotaduluth the couple have three children under 
the age of 6 
hes terrific says rachel tilsen of hudson wis a member 
of midwest villages and voices a competing small press based in 
minneapolis hes very respectful of the writer and he has a very 
creative image of the finished book and a wonderful knowledge of 
language he puts it together 
tilsens mother 88yearold meridel le seuer is one of the 
poets and storytellers in whom perlman has taken an interest 
perlman delights in her activist background including her being 
blacklisted by the late sen joseph mccarthy during the red scare 
i really dont want a bestseller perlman says it would 
take up a lot of time and i just dont want to be famous for one 
book i really want to do work with high literary standards 
perlman pores over 30 to 40 manuscripts a month but packages only 
six to eight books a year to avoid the foreclosure that would be 
certain if holy cow published only poetry perlman says he is 
beginning to dabble in quality childrens books 
reprints of le seuers sparrow hawk a historical tale about 
a young american indian and the story of johnny appleseed are 
already on the market perlman plans to reprint other le seuer books 
about davy crockett abraham lincoln and lincolns mother 
dan odegard owner of odegard books in minneapolis says holy 
cow is one of about a dozen independent presses in minnesota that 
publish books rich in literary value 
they fulfill a market that wouldnt be filled by large 
publishers odegard says 
reviews are important to perlman because he rarely sees monetary 
rewards he says lewis hyde once wrote in the nation magazine that 
holy cow was one of the best small presses in the united states 
thats no small accomplishment considering the country supports 
between 3000 and 4000 independent publishers the majority of 
which are run by one or two people 
a good review to me says it has some value even if it 
doesnt sell perlman says 
perlman who welcomes suggestions from his authors about the 
design of their books says his most disappointing experience came 
when he endured an abrasive pompous writer only to have the book 
fail commercially and critically he declined to be specific 
you just dont know how its going to be received perlman 
says sometimes a book just lies there acting like its dead 
other times it flies brother songs a poetry anthology written 
by men about fatherson brotherbrother and other male 
relationships has sold 6000 copies since its first printing in 
1979 to become holy cows most successful title 
perlman says the book is one of my answers to the feminist 
concerns from a male point of view 
other holy cow books in print or nearing publication are star 
quilt a book of poems by roberta hill whiteman an american 
indian studying at the university of minnesota fun and games a 
collection of short fiction by black writer clarence major and 
the invisible musician poems by ray a young bear a resident 
of the mesquakie tribal settlement near tama iowa 
i found the most passion in the work of minorities perlman 
says i dont think that many white writers can see from the top 
side whats going on in the culture 
so what makes brother songs and other poetry by holy cow good 
perlman says hes bullish on imagination and clarity subject 
matter is a close second 
and when its all wrapped in a binding it better be as wholesome 
as fresh milk when it comes to spelling and grammar 
thats real important to me perlman says most of my 
creative talent goes into editing 
if a holy cow book sells for 10 at bookstores perlman is 
likely to receive about 450 from each sale from that he must draw 
his salary pay for production and publicity and dish out royalty 
fees to the authors who are paid cash advances in some cases 
hes usually satisfied if a poetry book sells 1500 copies and a 
book of prose 3000 to 4000 copies but there are no guarantees 
because he sinks what little profit there is into the production 
of more books perlman says he is seeking nonprofit status from the 
internal revenue service as a nonprofit enterprise holy cow 
would be in a better position to seek grants from taxexempt 
philanthropic organizations and give perlman enough cash to hire a 
staffer and increase his volume to about 10 books a year 
im not a capitalist pig perlman says but i hope within 
the next year or two i can make a regular working wage

brian dennehy is at a point in his acting 
career where he no longer needs to do television yet unlike many 
film stars he refuses to turn his back on the small screen 
his latest tv appearance comes sunday in day one a 
prestigious drama on cbs about development of the atomic bomb hes 
completing the feature film street legal then hes off to 
moscow and tokyo for stage appearances as lopakhin in the cherry 
orchard 
most of television today is just a diversion dennehy says 
im at a point where im not expected to do tv my response is 
that if decent likeminded artists dont do tv we cant complain 
we have a social responsibility 
dennehy says day one is a balanced look at the decision to 
build and drop the atomic bomb 
its an attempt to understand the enormous accomplishment in 
building that weapon in 2 years without computers he says and 
it looks at the politics of deciding to use it the cold war may 
become a historical artifact so its important that we understand 
how it started 
dennehy stars as gen leslie r groves the man who built the 
pentagon and was the ramrod behind the supersecret manhattan 
project david w rintels produced the threehour drama and wrote 
the screenplay based on peter wydens book 
the movie also stars david strathairn as dr j robert 
oppenheimer and michael tucker as leo szilard with appearances by 
hume cronyn as james f byrnes hal holbrook as gen george c 
marshall richard dysart as president harry s truman david ogden 
steirs as president franklin d roosevelt and barnard hughes as 
harry l stimson 
dennehy on this day is at a hilltop park in culver city preparing 
for a nights work on street legal hell soon be up to his 
knickers in muck as a maverick police lieutenant who stumbles upon 
an international political conspiracy its his first solo starring 
role in a feature film 
im sweating out finishing this picture so i can get to moscow 
for rehearsals he says im probably the only guy who plays 
cops jumps on a plane to rush to moscow to show the russians how to 
play chekhov with a british director 
dennehy grew up in brooklyn where he was an allcity high school 
football tackle and played the title role in a senior class 
production of macbeth he got a degree in history at columbia 
university then spent five years in the marine corps including 
eight months in vietnam afterward he worked at a variety of jobs 
while honing his skills in offoffbroadway plays

roles in looking for mr goodbar foul play fist 
butch and sundance the early years and 10 among his later 
roles gorky park best seller silverado legal 
eagles cocoon and fx 
dennehy who has three daughters from an earlier marriage 
recently married jennifer arnott an australian costumer designer he 
met while doing return to snowy river one daughter elizabeth 
is in the cbs soap opera the guiding light she bears a striking 
resemblance to glenn close and since fatal attraction she has 
had some difficulty being cast in commercials 
another daughter kathleen is also an actress and has a small 
role in street legal his third daughter deidre attends 
medical school in chicago 
dennehy starred in two tv series big shamus little shamus 
and star in the family he was in the miniseries pearl and 
his most recent tv appearance was as a bounty hunter on an episode 
of cagney amp lacey under consideration as a spinoff series 
im at the point where i can do what i want he says i 
want to do good things the tragedy of television is that theres so 
little that is good but the networks are in trouble and theyre 
turning back to creative people 
back on the subject of his character in day one dennehy 
says groves is a fascinating guy he believed in his country he 
believed in accomplishments he believed in the work ethic he 
wasnt a very sophisticated man he was the one man with the 
extraordinary mind intellect discipline leadership and ambition 
to accomplish the task of building the bomb 
people now tend to look at oppenheimer as a hamlet who was 
never certain about the bomb once the deed was done and the bomb 
was dropped oppenheimer was a man who could not help but examine 
what he did and feel a terrible guilt groves on the other hand 
never doubted that it was necessary to save american lives

backstage at the american conservatory 
theater august wilson takes a pull on a cigarette and ponders the 
differences between regional theater and broadway 
one is about the work and the other is about money says the 
pulitzer prizewinning playwright broadway and broadway producers 
could care less about the work about the content of the work 
their concern is how are we going to get people into the 
theater to see whatever it is it could be the worst thing 
imaginablethats the way the producers think 
he allows that there are some happy coincidences when quality 
and profit overlap 
wilsons pulitzer prizewinning play fences enjoyed a 
successful broadway run and won a new york drama critics circle 
award and a tony 
he won another critics circle award for ma raineys black 
bottom which ran for six months but didnt make a profit a third 
broadway show joe turners come and gone closed at a loss 
after a brief run 
those three plays are part of a cycle of 10 works wilson is 
writing about the black experience during each decade of the 20th 
century it was acts production of joe turner that brought 
wilson to san francisco and he liked what he saw in a cast led by 
roscoe lee browne 
wilson is in the enviable position of having many offers from 
many quarters 
he has just completed the first draft of his play about the 
1960s tentatively titled two trains running and is working on 
the screenplay for fences he also has plans for some short 
stories a mystery novel more poetry and a performance piece called 
seven guitars that he says will diverge from his more 
traditionally structured plays 
all this work flows from a man who grew up on the poor side of 
town dropped out of school in ninth grade worked at odd jobs and 
got started as a writer by jotting down lines in restaurants and 
bars 
but it is that background that makes wilson what he is a keen 
observer of the sweat grit pain and injustice that marks life in 
americas underclass 
although his father had a presence in the household wilson 
was raised by his mother in pittsburghs hill district a melting 
pot of jews and syrians blacks and whites where he shared two rooms 
with three sisters and two brothers 
his first poems were written anonymously in the seventh grade to 
a pretty classmate named nancy ireland 
i would write these poems and leave them on her desk he 
says that lasted until nancy took up with a boy named anthony i 
always figured that she thought anthony was the one writing the 
poems 
nancys loss was the worlds gain as wilson continued to write 
poetry some were published in anthologies and the author found he 
could always pick up a few dollars reading some poems here and 
there 
but mostly he worked odd jobs terrible jobs for some terrible 
bosses 
one time i was an elevator i was not an elevator operator i 
was the elevator a mens clothing store was on the third floor and 
my job consisted of running from the first floor to the third floor 
when anyone came in to pick something up they had three tailors 
up there so they stayed pretty busy 
i didnt mind because i would read until someone came in 
in 1968 as black americans were debating the character of their 
culture and looking for ways to change their role in society wilson 
felt a need to contribute as an artist and with a friend founded 
the black horizon theater he knew nothing of theater at the time 
so the first thing i did was to go to the library and find a book 
on how to direct a play 
since we had a theater i ran right home and said let me write 
a play well i sat down and wrote a play and the characters did 
not talk and i said well this playwriting business is not for 
me 
he wrote a few oneact plays then went back to poetry 
to this day he says hes familiar with only one play by 
shakespeare and one by chekhov he has never seen a play by henrik 
ibsen david mamet or sam shepard ive never read raisin in the 
sun either i saw the movie 
the foundation of wilsons writing he says is the blues 
the reason im able to do what i do is because all the ideas 
and characters come out of the blues i listen to the music which i 
see as a cultural response of an entire people to the world that 
they find themselves in 
in 1978 wilson moved to st paul minn and got a job writing 
scripts for its science museum an actress from the museum invited 
him to see a play and wilson came away thinking he could do it 
better that gave birth to jitneys a play about gypsy cab 
drivers in pittsburgh 
that was the first realistic play i wrote 
it was also the start of wilsons 20th century cycle 
jitneys was set in 1971 fullerton street set in 1941 
followed because i wanted to write about the clash of the rural 
south and the urban north 
after that i wrote ma raineys black bottom which was set 
in 1927 and i felt why dont i just continue to do this and then 
fences was the 50s 
joe turner was set in 1911 piano lesson takes place in 
1936 
his intent in two trains running which takes place in the 
1960s is to show the relationship of blacks to the rest of american 
society 
once i had that as my focus i discovered the relationship was 
not very much unlike that of a slave community back during slavery 
although there is freedom and the emancipation proclamation a lot 
of the relationships still exist and so i thought i could show that 
relationship and the real problem 
the real problem in america is the labor problem thats why 
blacks were brought to america from africa as a labor system which 
is ironic at one time all blacks were working and now nobodys 
working

editors note once banned by the russian czars the balalaika 
is the most beloved musical instrument in the soviet union now a 
soviet orchestra on a tour of 40 us cities is introducing 
americans to the sound produced by an instrument which is something 
like a guitar but with some big differences 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there may be some scots who cant bear the 
bagpipe but its a rare russian who badmouths the balalaika 
the balalaika is the instrument most close to the russian 
soul says sergei lukin one of the 82 members of the osipov 
balalaika orchestra which is on a tour of 40 american cities 
through march 9 it is very tender very touching it starts 
singing in the hands of a real master 
whats a balalaika well its a stringed instrument somewhat 
like a guiter but is triangular shaped usually has only three 
strings and comes in a variety of sizes 
americans may remember the sound from laras theme on the 
sound track of the film dr zhivago 
lukin plays the domra which looks like a roundbodied banjo its 
flat front the size of a dinner plate many balalaikas sound best 
apparently mixed with complimentary instruments such as the domra 
lukin and other members of the osipov the soviet unions top 
balalaika orchestra were interviewed through an interpreter 
were doing all kinds of songs sad and merry they all depict 
the state of a soul says nikolai kalinin the orchestras 
conductor and artistic director 
there are really rhythmic energetic songs you want to dance 
when you hear them adds singer nadja babkina founder of the 
babkina folk ensemble which is on tour with the orchestra 
miss babkina who wears her long hair dramatically forward over 
one shoulder says that in the 16th century balalaika players were 
dispersed and their instruments were burned because they were 
thought to be diverting peoples attention from the church 
thats why a law was signed by our czar that all these groups 
of amateur artists should be destroyed and the instruments also 
she says russian people tried to hide these instruments in the 
18th century someone said it was time to renew them 
why dont you ask how to play it asks alexander gorbachev 
41 holding his wooden balalaika that was made in 1910 by a man 
named nalimov the stradivarius of balalaika makers 
then he demonstrates drawing his right index finger across the 
strings like a violin bow 
it is such a strong finger he can even open a bottle says 
sergei butushin who plays an array of horns that he has made some 
with bells made of cows horns 
i go to a place where they kill cows and take quickly their 
horns butushin says we have several such places in moscow 
the balalaika used mainly for playing folk music is more 
popular in rural areas but it is not unknown in the cities 
vladimir byeloblotsky 38 playing some jazz riffs on his bass 
balalaika says he was born in moscow and heard the balalaika as a 
child 
i started playing contrabass like in the symphony orchestra 
he says then i was very fond of jazz and i played in a jazz 
orchestra which went away from the soviet union and now is in the 
united states now im playing this bass balalaika and im really 
very happy i think that is the thing i wanted to do 
gorbachev who plays prima balalaika the main one of the 
five sizes of balalaikas in the osipov orchestra started on the 
accordion like his father 
i joined music school when i was 15 years old gorbachev 
says i heard balalaika and i liked very much the sound and i 
started seriously studying this instrument i was born in moscow but 
my relatives came from villages 
conductor kalinin explains that orchestra members and aspiring 
members alike must audition each year seniority doesnt count if 
somebody proves not so good he retires he says 
accordion player igor konovalov says i was born in 1941 when 
the germans were very close to moscow in the second world war my 
mother went to a village and i was born with an accordion in my 
hands at that time in villages it was the most popular 
instrument at night people came out of their homes and sat on 
benches and started playing 
i started playing the gormoyan which is a purely russian 
accordion when i was 12 
kalinin 45 the orchestra conductor for 10 years was once a 
professional singer his wife plays domra in the orchestra the 
youngest of their three children now 5 waved his hands like a 
conductor by a kind of inheritance his father says before 
he could talk 
butushin whose interest in horns crowded out his earlier 
balalaika playing has been in the orchestra for 20 years since he 
was 15 and has been on all its american tours in 1969 71 and 
77 
lukin 31 started out playing the cello as a boy in music school 
i was so small and the cello was so big and heavy i thought it 
was better if i played this domra he says since then i deeply 
love this instrument 
this domra player is the best in the soviet union kalinin 
says hes concert master in the orchestra he treats his domra 
like a beloved woman 
lukins wife also plays domra in the osipov orchestra and in the 
american concerts they play a duet which they encore with a scott 
joplin rag 
the osipov balalaika orchestra is the soviet unions biggest and 
best conductor kalinin says 
it was founded by vassily andreyev in 1919 consisting of eight 
players kalinin says he dressed the balalaika in a tuxedo 
conductor nikolai petrovich osipov later added other instruments 
and commissioned composers after his death in 1946 the orchestra 
was named for him 
the sound caught on outside the soviet union kalinin adds 
after andreyev led a tour balalaika orchestras were formed in 
countries all over the world

joe clark the principal of eastside high school in paterson 
nj decided that a baseball bat was as good an educational tool as 
books his controversial tactics are the focus of the new warner 
bros film lean on me the movie is reviewed this week by 
education writer lee mitgang who has covered the clark controversy 
and film critic bob thomas in sidebyside reviews 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
anyone who has ever met joe clark the principal of eastside high 
school in paterson nj knows that he would never allow a film 
crew into his school unless for the greater glory of joe clark 
this is after all the same joe clark who in 1987 virtually 
barred a state monitoring team from inspecting his building 
so its hardly a surprise that lean on me a new warner bros 
film shot on location at eastside and purporting to be based on the 
true story of the tough principal turns out to be little more 
than blackboard jungle propaganda aimed at vindicating clarks 
batandbullhorn educational methods 
warner bros has sunk a long way since last april when it made 
its commendable foray into the school world with the vastly superior 
stand and deliver a film with twice the plot and a hundred 
times more character development than this latest stand and 
deliver was about a high school math teacher in a los angeles 
barrio school who proved that inner city kids respond to the same 
kinds of positive things that rich kids do adults who really care 
clark by contrast captured headlines in recent years as the 
principal who restored order to an innercity school described by 
local prosecutors as a cauldron of violence 
in the seven years clark has run eastside he has indeed tamed 
this once graffitiscarred school 
his methods shocked some but pleased many others including 
thenus secretary william j bennett whose frequent praise helped 
make clark a national celebrity he prowled the hallways with a 
baseball bat and bullhorn suspended hundreds of students and made 
it clear to all that the sign in his office one way my way 
applied to teachers and students alike 
lean on me paints clark as a principal who bleeds for his 
kids but will stop at nothing including breaking labor and fire 
laws cursing out his superiors and humiliating teachers to 
achieve his aims 
clark won headlines as a black educator who blamed his schools 
problems on a failed social welfare system 
hardly have the opening credits finished rolling before the film 
has made sure no one has missed any of these points 
it opens with a brief shot of eastside high in more idyllic days 
in 1967 the school was mostly white boys wore ties clark then a 
young teacher wore a dashiki 
twenty years later we see a very different eastside with 
graffiti covering anything standing still long enough to be 
spraypainted girls openly molested drugs freely dispensed fights 
commonplace 
into the breach steps clark his challenge brush aside the 
smallminded politicians and school board restore order and raise 
standardized test scores quickly enough to avoid a state takeover of 
the school 
hey no sweat 
morgan freeman turns in a credible performance as clark 
capturing nicely clarks selfrighteousness the script by michael 
schiffer doesnt leave much room for character development but that 
wasnt the point of this film anyway clark himself had this to say 
of freeman as filming proceeded last june hes a good actor but i 
dont think anybody can fully portray me theres only one joe 
clark 
how true

if any critics organization offered an award for the most 
manipulative director the lifetime achievement award would surely 
go to john g avildsen consider his ability to rouse audiences to 
anger revulsion and especially the overwhelming joy of victory 
over impossible odds in such films as joe save the tiger 
rocky neighbors and the karate kid 
the new warner bros release lean on me is quintessential 
avildsen from the very first frame he grabs the viewers and plays 
their emotions with the skill of a disc jockey at a disco turntable 
you cheer and weep tears of joy despite the realization that you are 
being shamelessly used 
the film is based on the headlinemaking career of joe clark the 
black educator who turned the paterson nj eastside high school 
from a ghetto jungle into a model of achievement wielding a 
symbolic baseball bat michael schiffers script obviously takes 
liberties with the facts since it is orchestrated in a series of 
audiencestirring sequences 
joe clark morgan freeman is a zealous teacher whose fierce 
temper and outspokenness has relegated him to being principal of a 
white grammar school when eastside high is threatened with a 
takeover by the state because of a dismal academic record the mayor 
alan north and school superintendent robert guillaume 
reluctantly enlist clark as eastside principal 
clark begins by ousting all the drug dealers and goofoffs 
painting over the graffiti and haranguing both students and 
teachers he goes overboard alienating his staff and making an 
enemy of a powerhungry activist lynne thigpen clark is jailed 
for locking the school doors to keep out drug dealers but you can 
guess who triumphs in the end 
schiffer who also wrote the slambang colors has provided a 
messy screenplay overloaded with shouted speeches and offering an 
improbably sentimental climax that would make frank capra seem like 
chekhov but for those willing to leave cynicism at home lean on 
me can be a moving experience thanks in large part to morgan 
freemans powerful presence he is a marvel of raw energy commanding 
force 
beverly tyler has the relatively thankless role of clarks 
longsuffering assistant but she performs admirably the students 
are uniformly great 
norman twain produced the film which is rated pg13 mostly for 
language and violent action refreshingly the film makes little use 
of expletives which might have abounded in such a film running 
time 104 minutes

skerritt is the manager of a sleek mirrored highrise building

its an eighties nightmare the building becomes a stunning 
surreal maze of endlessseeming stairwells filled with mirrored 
walls with spectral images with crazy elevators that go crazy and 
demonic cars in a frozen parking garage 
note that all the special effects were shot oncamera some of 
them are ingenious and utterly simple and awfully scary 
director gary sherman couldnt get all the originals stars and 
couldnt afford the costly opticals and other lab effects so he and

a fish called wanda cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
one of the biggest boxoffice surprises of the season was a 
fish called wanda a juicy jewel heist romp starring john clease 
who also wrote the screenplay and michael palin of monty 
python fame kevin kline and jamie lee curtis 
wanda is the type of comedy we long to see but only get once 
every decade its wacky sophisticated obvious raunchy 
irreverent delicious and a laugh a minute 
george tom georgeson otto kline wanda curtis and ken 
palin pull a diamond heist and immediately set to doubletriple 
cross each other wanda and otto set up george and get him arrested 
for the crime but before the cops take him off in cuffs he hides 
the key to the safety deposit box in which the gems are hidden in 
kens fish food ken finds the key and hides it in the treasure box 
in his beloved fish tank where his prize fish is an angel also named 
wanda stay tuned for a tragic scene later in the movie featuring 
little wanda 
the only witness who can place george near the scene of the crime 
is a little old lady who owns three tiny dogs ken decides to kill 
her so she wont be able to testify he misses three times go 
figure but the bit as cruel and crazy as it is is also one of the 
funniest running gags on film 
cleese is georges defense counsel archie leech another gag 
for film buffs wanda decides to seduce archie in order to learn 
where george has hidden the loot only problem she falls in love 
with him 
otto her true love a maniacal former cia operative who will 
just about kill anyone who calls him stupid keeps close watch 
on wanda and archie like in putting stethoscopes to windows while 
they attempt to make love inside 
kline is brilliant as otto who fancies himself an intellectual 
because he reads nietzsche but as wanda tells him calling him 
stupid is an insult to stupid people he prances storms postures 
and leaps in and out of the type of character cleese made 
institutional as basil fawlty in fawlty towers 
palin as the animalloving stutterer ken is a delight cleese 
plays it pretty straight this time but gets big laughs for his 
russian striptease and for the scene in which his wife comes home 
just a little too early while wanda is there 
curtis however is the weak link in an otherwise sprightly 
flick she has no timing for comedy shes fortunate though in 
having a superb cast to keep her afloat 
dont rent a fish called wanda buy it this is a video to 
see again and again and again

honky tonk angel mca patty loveless 
 
patty loveless crystal clear voice lends a subtle rather than 
overpowering quality to her music so honky tonk angel her 
third album doesnt score an immediate knockout 
but its an enjoyable if not spectacular record that sounds 
better with repeated listening 
loveless works in the same musical territory as such hip country 
traditionalists as emmylou harris rodney crowell and rosanne cash 
shes at her best however with the popleaning ballads if you 
think and im on your side 
also worth hearing is her rendition of the great dont toss us 
away her version with backround vocals by crowell is more 
understated than the lone justice original but no less powerful as 
loveless makes a plea for keeping a romance alive even as all around 
it seems like everyone weve known their loves grown cold 
loveless band featuring fiddler mark oconnor and the always 
impressive albert lee on guitar is solid throughout on an album 
that sort of like a good concert opening act gives the sense of 
hearing an artist who may have something great in her future

symphonies no 24 26 27 and 30 by wolfgang amadeus mozart 
prague chamber orchestra conducted by sir charles mackerras telarc 
 
for listeners not enchanted with performances on original 
instruments but who want freshsounding more authentic versions of 
pre20th century works there is a middle course sir charles 
mackerras and the prague chamber orchestra take it in this telarc 
recording of four middle symphonies by the 17yearold mozart 
the orchestra is scaled back a harpsichord added and the style 
of playing is that of original instrument recordings though the 
instruments are modern the strings make more biting attacks and 
lean into the beginning of notes and the flutes and oboes leave out 
vibrato the sound is brisk and lean and full of life and the 
musicians play with a controlled exuberance 
there is a little too much echo to the sound a result probably 
of the recording site the castle of dobris in prague mackerras 
sometimes lets things move along a little too briskly though there 
are loving moments especially in the masterful slow movement of no 
27 perhaps the best part of the disc the main theme is a 
descending string passage capped by plucked notes in the cello 
which become their own counter theme in the next section 
as william mallochs fine linear notes point out these 
symphonies are numbered out of chronological order nos 26 and 27 
were written before mozarts julyseptember 1773 visit to vienna 
and nos 24 and 30 after oddly no 24 sounds the earliest with 
its simple descending threechord main theme in the first movement 
no 26 sounds the most operatic and was indeed used as an overture 
to a play no 30 is full of humor a lighthearted romp in the 
opening molto allegro movement followed by a stately andantino 
menuetto and haydenesque surprise ending in the final presto 
the vienna trip was mozarts third to the european music capital 
as a 7yearold prodigy he jumped into the lap of empress maria 
theresa and gave her a kiss for her praise the next time he got a 
gold watch in 1773 he got another audience but not the court 
appointment he had hoped for the empress in a letter compared the 
evertouring genius to a travelling beggar

it could have been an actors nightmare 
starring in a movie while the man youre portraying is always there 
peeping over your shoulder but for morgan freeman the results were 
great 
freeman who received an academy award nomination last year for 
his supporting role as the terrifying pimp in street smart is 
the star of warner bros lean on me he plays the role of joe 
clark the new jersey principal who turned a drugridden wasteland 
into a model high school with the symbolic weapons of a baseball bat 
and a bullhorn 
not only is joe clark alive and functioning at eastside high in 
paterson he was also present while lean on me was being shot at 
eastside 
joe was there before we started says freeman since we 
filmed in the school and school was in session he was there every 
day doing his job 
you want to know if that was daunting yes incredibly daunting 
the first week and a half or two i didnt know how i was going to 
do it 
how much of the performance is morgan freeman and how much is joe 
clark 
all of the performance is morgan freeman he replied what 
morgan freeman could bring in the way of joe clark was largely due 
to joe clark he was very available to me extremely helpful very 
supportive he made it easy despite my own sense of inadequacy 
but freeman still had to create a character not merely imitate 
joe clark 
thats what i lost sight of he admitted i went into this 
watching him and thinking i got to be joe clark rather than 
ive got to give a performance i had to straighten myself out on 
that it was like trying to make a studebaker look like a buick 
freeman was pleased to report that clark has seen the film and 
has given his seal of approval thats the seal that counts 
said freeman i really wanted him to like the movie i like him a 
lot 
not everyone agrees clark was tagged crazy joe because of 
some of his tactics including the chaining of school exit doors to 
keep out drug dealers or his initial act of expelling 300 
underachieving and troublemaking pupils freeman however 
dismisses clarks critics 
he is universally beloved by his students and thats all that 
counts people who disagree with him are meaningless theyre off in 
some kind of ivory tower i dont think they even know what he did 
some might argue that clark has been operating a fascist state 
so what answers freeman what do you think a school is 
its not a democracy you cant teach democracy if you cant catch 
the attention of the students no school i ever went to was a 
democracy 
his schools were in chicagos south side an area not unlike 
paterson morgan had been born in greenwood miss but his family 
moved north when he was young he remembers school as being much 
more orderly than what joe clark faces 
the streets were what i had to negotiate the schools were not 
a problem he remarked once you got through the doors of 
school you were safe there the teachers had control 
what lean on me represents is what happened to schools 
particularly in the inner cities in the 60s and 70s the schools 
were taken over by the students and the teachers were shortchanged 
their caseloads and classrooms were entirely too large their 
ability to discipline miscreants was undermined by supreme court 
rulings about corporal punishment in schools and their salaries 
were so low that they became secondclass citizens 
freeman first fell in love with acting in the third grade when 
he portrayed little boy blue in a class pageant in the seventh 
grade he won the illinois state prize as best actor in a drama 
contest but his real ambition was to become a hotshot pilot with 
a scarf around my neck and strafe the enemys flag 
in the air force he became a radar technician instead after his 
discharge he realized what he really wanted to do was act and he 
enrolled at los angeles city college to learn the basics his first 
professional job was dancing at the 1964 new york worlds fair then 
he joined a touring company of the royal hunt of the sun 
freeman managed to earn a living in plays such as hello 
dolly with pearl bailey and cab calloway and purlie and in 
tv shows such as pbss the electric company then in 1980 the 
jobs inexplicably stopped he still doesnt know why except maybe 
he was too outspoken in rejecting material he deemed substandard 
the drought lasted two years and he credits paul newman with 
helping him get work again casting him in a film the big 
breakthrough came with street smart 
i always wanted to play a pimp he admitted and this guy 
was real critics thought so pauline kael even theorized in the 
new yorker is morgan freeman the greatest american actor 
street smart which starred christopher reeve was released 
early in 1987 to soso business freemans achievement might have 
faded from view except that los angeles times critic sheila benson 
suggested to cannon films publicist lynn kwit that his performance 
deserved an oscar campaign 
his reaction to the academy nomination 
i felt fine it was like having a pat on the back and well 
done you sort of kick the dirt and say aw gee thanks 
laughing and try to hold onto your sense of self and not go off 
flying halfcocked its just a pat on the back

before georgia okeeffes painting of the 
lawrence tree left connecticut on a traveling show for the national 
gallery 16 months ago the trunk had been at the bottom and the 
branches at the top 
now its going back to the wadsworth atheneum in hartford with 
the tree standing on its head 
curators say on its head is what the artist intended when she 
painted the towering pine at author dh lawrences ranch north of 
taos 60 years ago but one of them adds that the national gallerys 
decision to show it that way has caused a firestorm of 
controversy 
in her last 10 years okeeffe chose at least three times to show 
the tree upright on a poster in a television documentary and in a 
book of her collected works the wadsworth similarly displayed it 
reaching upward toward a starlit sky but her final intentions were 
never made clear okeeffe who had lived near abiquiu since 1940 
died in santa fe in 1986 at the age of 98 
i warned the curators at the national gallery that this would 
become a subject of discussion of course if georgia okeeffe were 
alive one word would clarify it says juan hamilton a fellow 
abiquiu artist who was okeeffes helper and confidant during her 
last 13 years 
the viking press and hamilton say her 1976 book version was 
intentional 
okeeffe went over every one of the plates she approved 
everything says viking executive editor amanda vaill 
okeeffe and hamilton also displayed the painting with the tree 
upright on a wnettv pbs documentary in 1977 
in 1981 she gave the santa fe chamber music festival the right 
to use the painting on a poster again indicating a preference for 
the upright tree and the festival last month reprinted 5000 copies 
showing it that way 
this was the agreedupon orientation for our poster festival 
marketing director daniel kosharek says 
betsy kornhauser curator of american painting at the wadsworth 
says the artist left the question of how to hang the work up to the 
gallery when the wadsworth acquired it in 1979 
she said she looked at the tree from several directions and 
several ways and she felt that the painting could be hung from any 
direction kornhauser said 
the wadsworth chose to hang it with the tree reaching toward the 
top edge of the canvas but kornhauser is convinced that the 
national gallery research is correct and from now on the wadsworth 
will show the painting with the tree pointing toward the bottom 
in a 1929 letter to rebecca strand okeeffe wrote of her 
fourmonth trip to new mexico including a visit to the lawrence 
ranch i also got a painting of the big pine tree as you see it 
lying on that table under it at night it looks as though it is 
standing on its head with all the stars around pretty good for 
me 
in a 1931 letter to art critic henry mcbride okeeffe remarked 
that a picture of the painting in an art magazine lost the point by 
showing it standing on its ear that tree should stand on its 
head 
photos of a 1931 exhibition show the tree inverted as well 
hamilton says the artist was a little more flexible than some 
of the viewers of this work and either way may be considered 
correct today 
she was a person involved in change she wasnt a stagnant 
person hamilton says if she was hanging a show she would 
allow herself to do something similar and hang a painting 
differently 
jack cowart curator of 20th century art at the national gallery 
in washington agrees okeeffe was not wedded to first decisions 
about her work 
we dont mean to bind her to the prior decision but we would 
think that the 1930s decision had a greater pertinence to the 
original inspiration he said 
cowart cited the inverse visual logic that the artist had in 
the 30s other okeeffe paintings could be hung in multiple 
directions including the 1929 black hollyhock painted at mabel 
dodge luhans taos adobe 
despite the documentation cowart says the decision to show the 
lawrence tree in its original orientation touched off a firestorm 
of controversy 
weve been dealing with it since the exhibition opened they 
think theyve caught us in a mistake we didnt realize that the 
viking book would have such an indelible impact on the publics 
memory 
the national gallery tour was timed to coincide with the 100th 
anniversary of okeeffes birth and should honor her creative 
intent cowart says this inversion was not a caprice or whimsy 
it was out of reverence to the piece 
and from here on its a tossup he added with a laugh 
hamilton says okeeffe would have gotten a laugh out of it too 
probably nothing would have amused miss okeeffe more than 
people worrying about whether her painting was right side up or 
right side down says hamilton one of three copersonal 
representatives of the okeeffe estate and cocurator of the 
national gallery show 
the traveling exhibition closed feb 5 at the metropolitan museum 
of art in new york the show also visited chicago and dallas after 
opening in washington in november 1987 it now heads for los angeles 
for a march 31 opening 
however the lawrence tree wont be included in the los angeles 
visit which was tacked onto the schedule as an afterthought the 
painting returns to the wadsworth because the owners felt it had 
been away long enough

more than a year after a mysterious debilitating 
illness placed her career on hold entertainer lola falana says 
living has replaced the stage as her no 1 priority 
after a lifetime in the spotlight one brush with death and a 
second illness that left her partially paralyzed falana 46 has 
turned her back to the entertainment grind that has dominated her 
personal and professional life 
i want my life back she said in a recent interview in her 
apartment overlooking the las vegas strip where she performed for 
more than two decades the demands of my career had become very 
draining very depressing i wont lock myself in again so that i 
have no space to dream im not rushing back to that kind of world 
falana nearly died in 1983 when she suffered peritonitis 
following abdominal surgery in november 1987 she was diagnosed by 
doctors in las vegas and at ucla medical center as having multiple 
sclerosis a neurological disease that short circuits the central 
nervous system 
her sizzling dance routines a trademark since she wowed broadway 
in golden boy with sammy davis jr in the 1960s had been 
stilled in the summer of 1987 when she found her strength sapped by 
the illness 
she and her longtime manager joe schenk agree she will never 
dance again and she says shell never go back to life on the road 
she doesnt have the heart or the health 
i spent a good part of my life in airports sleeping on planes 
how chic is that 
she hasnt dismissed the idea of performing in her hometown of 
las vegas on a limited basis but wants nothing more to do the 
hassle of the road 
im learning to hear my body she says stress is the main 
factor in all diseases i need calm the whole world is hurry up 
well excuse me but i dont want to play ive matured into 
understanding what is important for my health 
since i was 14 ive been on every circuit of nightclub there 
is and if ive missed one i dont want to see it what is there to 
dedicate your career to one more dressing room that you find in the 
basement of a building 
whatever triggered this im not going to let it happen to me 
again 
i just got a second chance to learn how to live she said 
her voice rising im in charge when you get a second chance at 
life youd be amazed at how wide awake you become 
longtime friends such as davis wayne newton and julio iglesias 
have encouraged her to follow her heart mind her health but not 
close the door on her career 
they say you cant give up your gift but they also tell me 
its important that i get well 
in her mind she doesnt want to perform again schenk said 
the dancing is gone shell never do that again 
schenk believes the stenuous dance routines that were a falana 
trademark helped accentuate her problem 15 months ago falana 
believes she is totally recovered from the disease 
her health grew progressively worse in the summer and fall of 
1987 
the last performance i did was the worst i ever did she 
recalled of an engagement in orlando fla in august 1987 i 
couldnt feel my left foot touch the floor i had no rhythm in my 
left leg my vocal chords were collapsing everything was flat 
there was no lola on stage 
i was afraid to stray away from the piano because i needed it 
for support it was a scared person up there i couldnt switch the 
mike from one hand to the other i dont even remember the show 
except thinking how can i get off the stage 
by that fall she was bedridden she moved to an apartment after 
falling down the stairs at her home by nov 2 the left side of her 
body was paralyzed 
i couldnt move my arm or leg she recalled 
determined to lick the paralysis and the gloomy outlook of her 
doctors she said she began climbing small mountains propping 
herself up on an elbow grabbing a bed railing to try and sit up 
something inside was telling me youre not as helpless as you 
think 
by the 15th day after her diagnosis she decided to go to a 
shopping mall 
i had a limp a little drag in my left leg she recalled 
if i walked slowly it would look like i was just shopping just 
strolling if someone noticed i kissed it off by saying i had 
stubbed my toe 
after five months of therapy she was able to raise her left arm 
over her head now she wants to spend her time letting others know 
that faith in god can sometimes be a miraculous medicine 
beneath the pizzazz of show business is a fickle streak that 
leaves her cold 
ive seen people get every imaginable accolade but if they get 
one day older than the world thinks they should be they drop them 
like they have no talent at all she said 
show business is not the master to follow it does not love you 
back it takes what it needs and if you can get your share out of 
it good for you if not too bad goodbye 
some of the greatest actors and actresses in the world are 
sitting in a home someplace and cant even get a job to buy food 
with dignity 
whats ahead for lola falana 
im planning on being healthy being well meeting a marvelous 
gentleman someday settling down being his wife 
now that ive seen all the games all the glitter all the 
illusions im ready for the real things in life human relations

who the heck is tobias wolff to be writing his 
memoirs 
thats the question that wolff an awardwinning short story 
writer whose name elicits admiration in literary circles but blank 
looks outside of them pondered in a recent interview 
its a query hes fielded a lot lately with the publication of 
this boys life a memoir atlantic monthly press 1895 and 
it makes him a little defensive 
these are not my memoirs in the sense of famous people i have 
known or wonderful places i have been its an account of what its 
like to come of age in this country said the author citing frank 
conroys stoptime and mary mccarthys memoirs of a catholic 
girlhood as like works 
but doesnt it take a kind of arrogance for a writer to decide 
his life is as interesting as his fiction 
it requires i would say more courage than arrogance to write 
a memoir he said i think theres a certain amount of arrogance 
inherent in writing anything because what youre in essence doing 
is going up to complete strangers and saying im so interesting 
that youre just going to have to spend 20 to spend three hours in 
my company 
you have to be willing to get your neck chopped off when you 
write a memoir its a kind of humbling activity rather than the 
other way around 
this account of growing up in bluecollar chinook wash and 
other roughandtumble locales in the 1950s has received high praise 
for its honest and unsentimental evocation of childhood 
wolff who begins the book as a 10yearold cadging his mother 
into buying him souvenirs he knows she cant afford and ends it with 
his getting kicked out of prep school has resisted all temptation 
to make either himself or his childhood idyllic 
the youth we see in these pages the young tobias preferred the 
name jack during this period after jack london breaks school 
windows pelts cars with eggs sneaks the family car out on joy 
rides and in an ultimate ruse forges references and school records 
to get himself admitted to prep school 
much of the deliquency is a rebellion against a totalitarian 
stepfather dwight who berates and occasionally beats the boy and 
forces him to do demeaning tasks such as spending weeks shucking 
prickly horse chestnuts that are then allowed to mold 
wolff 43 is the author of two short story collections back 
in the world and in the garden of the north american martyrs 
and a novella the barracks thief which won the 1985 
penfaulkner award 
he is also the younger brother of the novelist and former 
newsweek critic geoffrey wolff although the two grew up in separate 
households geoffrey was raised by his father on the east coast 
while tobias traveled with his mother out west 
geoffrey wolffs wellreceived the duke of deception 
published in 1979 was a chronicle of his father a charismatic con 
artist constantly reinventing himself a man who once fasttalked 
his way into an aeronautics position with a bogus resume it is 
uncanny how the young jack duplicates his fathers deceptive 
behavior even though the elder wolff was a virtual stranger to him 
wolff is a nervously energetic man whose mind races far faster 
than his answers to an interviewers questions with the result that 
he is constantly restarting sentences or leaving them unfinished he 
is dressed in jeans a plaid shirt and reeboks that belie his 
professorial status he has taught creative writing at syracuse 
university in new york for the past eight years 
the author believes that it is a very powerful myth in our 
culture for adults to remember growing up as a magical and happy 
time and that he had altered his childhood memories to fit that 
notion until he started working on this book 
and then i discovered a darkness in those years that i had 
forgotten about glossed over its like women who remember years 
later in analysis that their fathers abused them you think how 
could they go on all these years without remembering this but we 
do he said 
this boys life ends with jack being dismissed from the prep 
school being academically unprepared for the rigorous curriculum he 
had duped his way into and joining the army 
in the interview wolff picked up where the book leaves off 
describing his duty tour in vietnam and wandering through europe 
afterward he fell in love with oxford england and discovered that 
he could attend the university even without a high school degree if 
he could pass the grueling entrance exams he crammed for eight 
months hiring tutors to instruct him in english literature and 
history latin and french passed the exams and went on to graduate 
he then returned to the united states working briefly for the 
washington post where he got fired when he lazily didnt 
doublecheck an obituary that turned out to be a prank from there 
he went to california got a stegner fellowship at stanford 
university and started publishing stories 
wolff said he has no plans to make a book out of the material of 
his adult self and is currently finishing up a collection of short 
stories and has plans for two novels 
looking back on this boys life wolff said he finds himself 
talking about jack in the third person as if he were a character he 
created instead of his youthful self 
the very act of writing about him make him something on the 
page makes him different from me he said i find myself 
feeling amused at some of the things he does i feel affection 
irritation i have the feelings toward him that i might have 
toward a son

homer joy recently got a call from a woman who 
had once scolded him for his noisy guitar playing and singing 
joy 43 said the former neighbor recalled the confident young 
musicians reply 35 years ago that she wouldnt yell at him after 
she heard his songs on the radio 
the apologetic call came after his song streets of 
bakersfield was nominated for a grammy as country song of the 
year and joy was nominated as songwriter of the year 
now joy hopes the song that also helped buck owens and dwight 
yoakam receive a grammy nomination for country duo of the year will 
also help him find a record company to distribute a gospel album 
it was 16 years ago that joy wrote and recorded the streets of 
bakersfield about the frustration he felt while recording a 
soundalike album of hank williams sr songs at owens 
bakersfield calif studio 
it just wasnt what i wanted to do joy said during a recent 
interview but because he was under contract with buck owens 
enterprises he finished the project then insisted that producer 
bob morrison listen to him play a song hed written 
i really got kind of redneck about it joy said but the end 
result was that owens heard the song and loved it and had joy 
record it 
the streets of bakersfield was a top 10 hit in 1973 for joy 
a native of heber springs ark 
joy had another hit single with john law in 1974 and owens 
freddie hart and other bigname country singers were recording his 
songs he performed on the same bill with nashville stars such as 
roy clark mel tillis and tanya tucker 
the version of the streets of bakersfield recorded last year 
by owens and yoakam hit the top of the country charts but in the 
years between his version and the latest version of the song joy 
hit rock bottom 
joy said he and owens mutually agreed to end his contract in 1976 
because of artistic differences after that he proved unable to 
cope with the pressures traveling and temptations of being a rising 
star after joy and his wife of 15 years lois divorced in 1978 
his life changed 
i sold 45 million records and then i had everything i owned 
in a cardboard box in 1983 joy said it was a real disaster 
but the downandout wanderer who as a boy would sneak out of 
saturday movie matinees to sing with salvation army bands on 
streetcorners in spokane wash said he got a dose of salvation 
that helped him recover and gave him a new outlook on his music 
i accepted the lord six years ago joy said he and lois 
remarried in june 1983 and the following year a daughter bethany 
was born 
the joys have seven children along with his wife sons morgan 
and preston accompany their father on the album of gospel songs hes 
recording at a studio in spokane 
my wife and i said a prayer a year ago and it couldnt have 
been more than three weeks later that dwight and buck did the song 
on the country music awards anniversary show he said 
their record was released last july and hit no 1 on oct 15 but 
joy said that was just a start 
i believed streets of bakersfield was no 1 with a bullet 
that it being no 1 was just really the beginning of things he 
said and its turned out to be true 
its been good for everybody this song has touched and were 
really thankful our prayer was that we could have a way to finance 
our gospel album 
for that project joy picked the 10 best songs hes written since 
he became a christian six years ago they are songs hes sung in 
performances at missions penitentiaries and christian services at 
rodeos 
i havent ever written a song that isnt based on truth he 
said including his old songs about getting drunk or stoned 
womanizing and all those other kind of things but i dont believe 
in those things now 
there was a time when i did and i lived like that so now we 
try to live what we write now 
joy still enjoys playing secular music and he says his 
gospel songs arent an attempt to stuff the bible down peoples 
throats 
we just try to do what we believe in and hope it will touch 
people like the streets of bakersfield touched a whole lot of 
people 
hes well aware that the success of a song revived after 16 years 
doesnt guarantee a good response for a new gospel album 
this thing with streets of bakersfield will get it listened 
to joy said but im not ignorant and i know that the album 
has to stand on its own aside from anything else and i believe it 
will

scientists know a lot about smell they know it 
weakens as we get older it varies depending on a persons sex and 
ethnic background and it involves more than just the nose what 
they generally dont know is why 
within the scientific community smell has always taken a back 
seat to the other senses probably because we dont live in an 
olfactory world we live in a visual world a world of sounds 
said dr john s kauer a new england medical center researcher 
trying to determine brain function using the nose 
last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the 
path of an odor impulse through the brain of a salamander the work 
produced a movie or series of colorenhanced pictures showing 
that the brain is a parallel processor handling many signals 
simultaneously like a supercomputer 
the research may have implications for the study and treatment of 
brain tumors by helping differentiate between tumors and normal 
tissue 
scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory 
oddities as a link between premature decline in smell and 
alzheimers disease a protein that ferries odor molecules through 
the nose the fact that half of all people between ages 65 and 80 
suffer major loss in the sense of smell and the trait peculiar to 
some nasal nerve cells to regenerate 
theyre the only neurons in the human body that undergo this 
spontaneous renewal and spontaneous decay kauer said 
some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at 
medical advancement but at the bottom line in union beach nj 
dr craig warren heads a research and development team for 
international fragrances and flavors inc a company that produces 
scents for soaps perfumes and other products made by hundreds of 
companies around the world 
smell warren said is the one sense for which the mechanism 
for perception is unknown scientists know how odor molecules are 
gathered by smell neurons but they dont know how a few similar 
types of receptor cells can distinguish between thousands of 
different odors 
research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than 
the nose warren said when blindfolded most people cannot 
discriminate a lemon from a lime or an orange from a grapefruit 
iff regularly brings in dozens of smell samplers usually women 
to rate and react to fragrances with emphasis on how the fragrances 
can alter mood in the process warren has found that 10 percent and 
15 percent of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of 
smell 
at the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of 
smell 
mary brooks 35 of philadelphia took an uncommon route to this 
fairly common problem beginning in 1972 she began to experience 
what amounted to smell hallucinations she thought she smelled an 
unpleasant odor when there was no odor present years of anguish and 
unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain sugery in which her 
olfactory nerve was removed ending her hallucinations but leaving 
her incapable of smelling 
it can be very dangerous she said ive already burnt 
things in the oven and i didnt know it and there are smoke alarms 
everywhere but on the other hand it doesnt bother me not to smell 
because i still sense that im breathing and smelling the same as 
you are 
brooks doctor was richard doty director of the university of 
pennsylvania smell and taste center patients include the aged and 
professionals like wine tasters firefighters police officers gas 
company workers inspectors and cooks whose lives and livelihoods 
can depend on the sense of smell 
there have always been problems that people had and theyve had 
no place to turn in the past doty said its a frontier of 
science which really hasnt even been touched on 
thats no accident kauer said our world doesnt require it 
we really dont go out and forage for food by sniffing along the 
ground that evolution took place millions of years ago 
doty daniel a deems and stanley stellar published a report in 
august in the journal neurology linking the loss of smell and 
parkinsons disease a year earlier a similar study linked the loss 
of smell to alzheimers disease a new area of research will try to 
determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway for viruses or 
chemicals that contribute to those maladies doty said 
the general subject headings scientists have explored give an 
idea of the scope of smell research the influence of body tilt on 
the sense of smell and the effect of mouth movement swallowing and 
spitting studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting 
distinctions korean americans appeared to have particularly acute 
ability to identify smells black americans in one sampling had 
trouble with cedar and cheddar cheese whites had trouble with 
gingerbread native japanese scored poorly on clove and fruit punch 
despite this mountain of research a key question that puzzles 
scientists is precisely how the sense of smell works 
at johns hopkins university dr solomon snyder last summer 
identified a carrier protein that ferries odor molecules up the 
nose the discovery occurred inadvertently in a search for receptors 
that play a key role in distinguishing smells snyder said but 
another possibility as to why the receptors havent been found is 
that they dont exist 
other factors sight sound and environment for example help 
provide the brain with cues in identifying smells he said but 
the fundamental discrimination is going to be in the nose

a new method of wresting radioactive 
uranium from natures grasp is ready for commercial use and could 
put the united states at the forefront of the 2 billion enrichment 
industry a scientist says 
i can get real excited about the economic incentives said 
robert merriman an associate director of oak ridge national 
laboratory and program manager for development of atomic vapor laser 
isotope separation but i have to confess i believe the principal 
reasons we want to be in the business in the long term are our 
energy security and our national security we cannot become 
dependent on foreign suppliers for yet another one of our fuels 
uranium235 the form needed for bombs and nuclear reactors 
comprises only about 07 percent of the metal in nature to be 
useful that concentration must be increased to 3 percent to 4 
percent resulting in enriched uranium 
the united states still uses gaseous barrier diffusion developed 
during world war ii and since refined to enrich uranium the 
uranium is converted to a gas and pumped repeatedly through a series 
of ceramic filters because u235 is lighter than the most common 
isotope u238 it passes through 
but gaseous barrier diffusion done in the united states at 
plants in portsmouth ohio and paducah ky is costly i believe 
the technology in our gaseous diffusion plants is the best in the 
world but mother nature just dictated a lot of kilowatt hours for 
that approach merriman said 
eighty percent of the cost of gaseous barrier diffusion is the 
electricity he said our expectation is that over the next decade 
energy prices will drive our cost up to the point where our prices 
are not competitive 
the portsmouth plant also is awaiting cleanup of tons of 
radioactive waste 
avlis chosen in 1985 as the preferred us method makes use of 
the fact that the different electron energies of u235 and u238 
absorb different colors of light lasers are tuned so they emit a 
combination of colors absorbed only by u235 atoms which then emit 
an electron leaving the atom positively charged and capable of 
separation using electromagnetic fields 
this process according to the department of energy is vastly 
more efficient than gaseous barrier diffusion or a third technique 
using centrifuges to spin off the lighter u235 the centrifuge 
process uses less electricity but lost out to avlis for government 
sponsorship in this country 
the united states two main competitors for the nuclear fuel 
market are urenco a consortium of britain the netherlands and west 
germany that uses the centrifuge process and a consortium of spain 
belgium france and italy that uses a french diffusion plant with a 
nuclear power plant dedicated to it 
merriman said he is confident avlis has matured to the point of 
commercial deployment and maybe just in time 
duke power is studying a venture with urenco to build a uranium 
enrichment plant in the united states using european technology 
avlis has all the attributes of the kind of technology the 
country is looking for merriman said it uses about 10 percent 
of the electricity of gaseous diffusion its very compact and its 
a hightech endeavor 
the components of avlis have demonstrated they would work on a 
commercial scale he said its now a question of getting the 
engineering done to make it work cheaply so we can compete and 
build a plant i dont have any doubt well get there 
the goal is to operate an avlis plant to enrich uranium at half 
the cost of current technology merriman estimates a commercial 
avlis plant with an output equivalent to that of the paducah gaseous 
diffusion plant would cost about 15 billion to 2 billion and take 
eight or nine years to build it could be built in modules and 
phased in as market conditions dictate he said

karl fuls was angry and frustrated after losing 
his legs to circulatory problems what i needed was to talk to me 
now he says 
therapists counselors doctors social workers nobody helped 
me how much money i could have saved how many dead ends i could 
have avoided 
savvier now and far more selfsufficient fuls last august set up 
the broken wing a nonprofit organization that matches the newly 
disabled with a person of the same sex age background and handicap 
to discuss strategies for coping 
everybodys got questions fuls 62 said sitting in a 
motorized chair at the rehabilitation institute of pittsburgh during 
a recent meeting three of the 16 people were in wheelchairs three 
had canes and several wore leg braces 
theyre not going to ask a doctor theyre not going to ask a 
therapist they will ask questions to people like themselves how do 
you put makeup on how do you take a shower is my sex life over 
things like this he said 
its all new i cry being with somebody like you helps you 
can even laugh said mary ann tomko a 50yearold grocery 
employee who sought moral support and practical advice from 
broken wing members after her right leg was amputated abovethe knee 
last fall because of a blood clot 
her parents with whom she lives accompany their only child to 
meetings 
it affects me too i thought i was going to die eleanor 
tomko 71 said her eyes filling with tears 
john mccrorey 57 whose left side has been paralyzed for eight 
years because of a stroke thrives on helping others the former 
engineer regularly chats with an advertising executive whos 
recovering from a stroke its just good to talk about our mutual 
problems its like losing half of your body and dragging it along 
with you your body commits suicide 
its good to have hope theres light at the end of the 
tunnel 
occupational therapist annie miller the broken wings secretary 
acknowledges there are innumerable support groups to which the 
handicapped can turn but they operate on a communication or 
verbal level 
they get together they meet they discuss and emotionally they 
may feel better about their disabilities 
the broken wing offers more than just emotional support and 
conversation we are out there to provide a service to physically 
make people more independent miller said 
fuls had no idea how much hed learned about coping most of it 
the hard way until 1984 when he was leafing through his diary 
he began writing about his health problems a year before being 
diagnosed with arteriosclerosis after his fourth and final 
amputation in 1982 for example his wheelchair rolled backward down 
a ramp outside his house only later did he learn he needed a 
special chair for amputees that accounts for the imbalance 
i was mad he said it made me start thinking 
soon afterward the idea for a network to nurture independence 
was born 
after several years of research and planning the broken wing 
finally was chartered last august with headquarters at fuls home in 
suburban white oak 
forty strong and growing the broken wing is seeking grants for 
office space and a computer system that would link the longtime 
disabled to the newly handicapped eventually nationwide since late 
january fuls has been talking to support groups in search of 
volunteers 
his message is simple do they remember how hard it was for 
them to adjust to a handicapped lifestyle and would they be willing 
to have someone else benefit from their experience

adverse weather forest service 
searchanddestroy missions and its own insatiable appetite have 
slowed the advance of the western spruce budworm that has spread 
across millions of acres this decade 
the outbreaks are clearly on the decline said james hadfield 
of the us forest service the infestation has been the worst one 
that we have ever experienced in terms of the extent of area 
defoliated and damage caused 
the tiny brown caterpillar was first spotted in 1980 on 5000 
acres near cove ore it has spread through oregon and washington 
primarily east of the cascades feeding on needles of fir and spruce 
and destroying vast numbers of understory firs growing in the 
shadow of mature trees 
the effects will continue to be felt as long as 70 years out 
because of the effect on the growth of trees hadfield said 
adverse weather at critical developmental stages and forest 
service eradication efforts using chemical and biological pesticides 
have helped reduce the infestation in addition trees in areas 
where the budworm has been present for several years are so damaged 
that they cant sustain the insect 
budworms defoliated 28 million acres last year down from 42 
million in 1987 and from a peak 6 million in 1986 we ar still 
predicting a very extensive area of defoliation in 1989 even though 
the intensity of the defoliation by and large will be pretty 
light hadfield said 
the forest service plans to test a new biological pesticide 
bacillus thuringiensis which homes in on budworms on two plots of 
1000 and 10000 acres in wallowawhitman national forest in 
northeastern oregon

it took modern radiological techniques to 
take the wraps off two mummies at the albany institute of history 
and art demonstrating that the bodies were of a man and a woman 
and that the woman had a fake toe 
the toe possibly made of a ceramic material may have been the 
womans ticket to the afterlife said curator tammis groft 
egyptians believed people had to be physically intact to enter the 
hereafter and attempts were often made to restore missing body parts 
during mummification groft said 
albany medical center radiologists used standard xrays and 
computed tomography scans which provide a computerenhanced 
crosssection image of a body to study the mummies one of which 
was only partially wrapped 
that mummy was a man as museum experts had suspected since 
acquiring the mummies in 1909 it may have been a priest known as 
ankhefenmut who was buried in the temple of mut at karnak in thebes 
groft said 
we were pretty sure the partially unwrapped mummy was a male 
he said the xrays confirmed it showing a male pelvis and 
genitalia but the wrapped mummy remained a mystery until we saw 
the xrays 
the radiology tests showed that both are from the 21st egyptian 
dynasty circa 1085 to 945 bc both probably died of natural 
causes experts theorize since the tests didnt reveal any trauma 
to their bodies its estimated that the man died in his 50s or 60s 
and that the woman was about a decade younger

a wild legume that has been eaten in 
eastern north america for nearly 5000 years needs less fertilizer 
than potatoes and yields three times the crude protein says a 
researcher who sees it as a food crop 
the groundnut or rosary apios americana is a small 
climbing vine that produces clusters of edible pealike seed pods 
and tubers it grows along sandy creek banks through bushes and 
over fallen trees 
historically the plant is important because very few crops 
native to north america have been domesticated said 
horticulturalist william blackmon of louisiana state universitys 
agricultural experiment station 
a legume like peas peanuts and soybeans the groundnut produces 
nitrogen and so needs less fertilizer than some food plants 
blackmon said the plant can survive frost and other conditions 
unsuitable for many other crops 
the tubers taste like a cross between an irish potato and a 
peanut when boiled and can be used in casseroles corn bread and 
stirfry cooking work is just beginning on recipes and other uses 
for the groundnuts which are edible but harder to produce and might 
be processed into flour 
blackmon has been joined by researchers at the university of 
minnesota and north carolina state university he began sending 
seeds to home gardeners in the united states and 16 other countries 
in 1986 with mixed results 
these were wild seeds and some of the wild seeds were just not 
productive he said a lot of times youll have a gardener 
wholl be real clever and will come up with something thats 
productive 
blackmon is trying to develop a plant with a more compact vine 
and with tubers closer to the stem to facilitate mechanical 
harvesting 
i think that in some places it might be very beneficial to the 
world food supply he said the thing will stay stored in the 
ground so you dont have to store it you can pull it when you 
need it

overweight people could control their 
appetites without jangled nerves and drug dependency if a european 
appetite suppressant under study here for a french pharmaceutical 
company proves successful 
university of florida psychologist neil rowland recently 
completed a preliminary study of the effect of dexfenfluramine on 
laboratory rats fattened either by an eatallyouwant feast of 
chocolatechip cookies and sweetened milk or by surgically neutering 
the animals to control hormone levels 
in either case we end up with fat rats they overeat and put 
on the human equivalent of 50 extra pounds in a few weeks rowland 
said we then administer the drug to the rats through surgically 
implanted capsules what we find is that on this drug the rats show 
considerable sustained weight loss 
as long as they are given the drug they keep the weight off 
that is one drawback common to all diet drugs he said whether 
its with rats or people as long as they are given drugs they tend 
to keep weight off but once they stop the drug they gain back 
weight 
dexfenfluramine which has been available in europe for several 
years has several advantages over more traditional diet drugs 
rowland said it does not have any stimulant properties if 
anything one side effect is mild sedation because of that it has 
absolutely no abuse potential 
and based on european clinical tests the drug which rowland is 
testing for the french drug company servier produces little of the 
nausea or drowsiness often associated with other appetite 
suppressants 
there are many theories about how it works he said it 
may send a premature message to the brain that the stomach is full 
or it may be affecting body metabolism my feeling is that it is 
working at several different levels in the body which is fortunate 
because that tends to enhance its effectiveness

independent oilexporting nations are 
likely to agree to cut their crude production to give another boost 
to prices a top opec official predicted 
it is in their interest to reduce the supply so that we can 
reach 18 dollars a barrel subroto secretarygeneral of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries said monday 
the 13 nations that comprise opec agreed in november to slash 
production as of jan 1 in an effort to raise prices to their target 
of 18 a barrel 
the agreement sparked a rally that has lifted the average price 
of a basket of crudes monitored by opec to about 16 a barrel up as 
much as 5 from late november 
opec officials want nations outside the cartel to join them in 
trimming output to spur another price pickup 
representatives of a group of independent countries were meeting 
tuesday in london to discuss cuts they met last month with opec 
representatives 
there is definitely a positive sign that not only for our 
interest but for their own interest they will do something in 
reducing the supply subroto a former indonesian oil minister 
said in an interview 
the more they cut from their production of course the sooner 
we can see it in dollars a barrel he said 
he declined to speculate on the level of cuts the nonopec 
nations might put in place but he said it was likely they would 
make an offer to opec possibly next month 
one participant at the nonopec meeting said in london monday he 
was fairly optimistic about this meeting because were all very 
friendly 
subroto predicted crude prices would definitely reach 18 in the 
second half of 1989 
new opec figures he said show member nations complied in 
january with the new output accord the agreedment set an overall 
ceiling or quota of 185 million barrels a day for the 13 nations 
in the first six months of this year 
according to opec figures 12 countries supplied a total of 1742 
million barrels a day in january just under the quota of 1751 
million barrels 
the cartel said figures from the united arab emirates had not yet 
been received that nation however has persistently overshot its 
target in the past according to private analysts its current quota 
is 988000 barrels a day 
subroto said the supply figures were a sign that we are abiding 
by our quota 
private analysts estimated opec exceeded its ceiling in january 
by about a million barrels a day 
opec said however it measures the quota by figuring crude 
production and the amount of oil put into or taken out of stock 
production which it defines as the amount of crude measured at 
storage facilities was 1813 million barrels a day in january for 
the 12 reporting countries 
it was the first time the cartel released monthly production 
figures 
nonopec nations sending representatives to tuesdays meeting 
were oman mexico egypt malaysia china angola and colombia the 
soviet union norway the yemen arab republic the canadian province

just as texans are hearing reports of an economic 
revival and new plans for reviving savings and loans theyre faced 
with yet another industry crisis insolvencies in dozens of the 
states insurance companies and the collapse of one of its largest 
the 54 million failure of national county mutual fire insurance 
co which had an estimated 100000 policyholders triggered a state 
inquiry into the state board of insurance and the industry itself 
with 42 texasbased insurance companies and 98 that do business 
in the state being liquidated fears are growing that texas insurers 
are following the same road as sampls 
the potential is there said state rep eddie cavazos 
dcorpus christi house insurance committee chairman of budget and 
oversight i dont think we have gotten to the bottom of the pit 
of insolvent insurance companies and the closer we get to the 
bottom the more horror stories i hear 
a state auditors report issued last week estimated the 
liabilities of insurance companies in receivership exceeded their 
assets by an estimated 200 million to 300 million as of aug 31 
state officials say the factors that bedevil the insurance 
industry are the same as those that endangered the thrifts lax and 
inept regulators depressed real estate and oil markets and 
freespending company officials 
in 1987 texans paid an estimated 26 billion for insurance 
premiums the audit said 
the audit urged the insurance board to make identifying 
financially troubled insurance companies its highest priority 
regulators came under sharp criticism for their handling of 
national county whose president robert h walker is believed to 
be in switzerland 
the insurance board staff knew about national countys problems 
as early as 1986 but did not move to place the dallasbased casualty 
and property insurer in receivership until oct 24 1988 
a legislative report showed it took an average of more than one 
year from the time examiners knew a company was in deep financial 
trouble and the time it was placed into conservatorship 
in december when insurance commissioner doyce lee resigned under 
pressure he described the agency as under siege trying to keep up 
with the insurance industry after years of being understaffed and 
underfunded while the sour economy brought on record insolvencies 
during 1987 the agency was reorganized and its staff expanded 
from about 850 employees to 1300 board members said the 
reorganization contributed to the problems 
but state sen john montford dlubbock blamed inept 
management 
theyre running at a pace that would have worked in the 
1930s he said 
montford who chairs the state senate affairs committee that 
conducted hearings on national countys failure has sponsored 11 
bills aimed at restructuring the insurance board also being drafted 
is a measure that would set up an oversight panel 
regulatory and criminal investigations are under way to determine 
what led to national countys insolvency the costliest in texas 
history the companys primary business was automobile insurance for 
highrisk drivers 
insurance board liquidator james t odiorne has filed a lawsuit 
against walker and his sons alleging that walker and perhaps 
others diverted premium money to affiliated companies 
also named in the suit are texas national insurance co southern 
life investment co bent tree national bank western fire amp 
casualty insurance co ltd walker national general agency inc and 
superior premium finance inc 
as in the savings and loans crisis consumers could end up 
footing part of the bill to pay claims which are expected to total 
40 million 
initially claims will be paid through the texas property and 
casualty guaranty fund supported by healthy insurance companies but 
subsidized indirectly by the state 
tax credits the state gives to insurance companies that 
contribute to the guaranty fund translate into lost state treasury 
revenue leaving taxpayers to make up the deficit 
the new insurance commissioner aw woody pogue said he 
expects more failures but none of the magnitude of national county 
weve made a lot of changes on the board he said im very 
optimistic that weve turned it around

robert h walker may have swiped more than 20 
million from the insurance company he led before it became one of 
texas largest industry failures 
or he may be the most prominent insurance industry figure to fall 
victim to the havoc wreaked on the texas economy by the oil and gas 
industry collapse 
or both 
state and federal investigators trying to understand the failure 
of walkers company national county mutual fire insurance co may 
have to wait for his explanations first they have to find him 
the tycoon they say has ignored subpoenas and may have fled the 
country 
the 58yearold walker rose and fell in grand texas style buying 
rounds for patrons of his giant honkytonk sailing a 
multimilliondollar yacht and flying several private planes before 
being caught in the economic pinch 
by the time national county was taken over by the state board of 
insurance in october 1988 the propertycasualty insurer was more 
than 50 million in the red the size of the failure prompted a 
crisis of confidence in the states insurance regulators who have 
been accused by some lawmakers of failing to act quickly to help the 
companys estimated 100000 customers 
mr walker is allegedly an example of what can happen when you 
have this lethargic attitude by a regulatory agency said state 
sen john montford 
montford serves on the senate state affairs committee which has 
subpoenaed walker to appear at a hearing 
insurance board attorney susan martin said that based on reliable 
sources she believes walker is in switzerland 
walker is accused of concealing fraud and funneling premiums from 
national county to walker general agency his dallasbased holding 
company that owned the insurance operation according to a lawsuit 
filed by national countys stateappointed receiver james odiorne 
the state has seized some of walkers property including two 
sterling silver decorative saddles valued at 100000 apiece 
walker owned a home in dallas and a ranch in the texas hill 
country his fortune was spread among more than 60 small companies 
and real estate properties 
until he transferred his control last year walker was part owner 
of the million dollar cowboy bar a jackson wyo honkytonk with 
saddles for barstools silver dollars embedded in the bar and an 
11000squarefoot dance floor he and two others bought the saloon 
in 1979 
walker became wellknown in the small tourist town during his 
visits several times a year stopping at the million dollar he 
often would buy a round for the house and occasionally fly friends 
to las vegas 
mostly he just partied said david hauser who managed the 
million dollar for eight years he was a nice guy we seemed to 
get along real fine 
walker could not be reached by the associated press calls to 
family members were unanswered calls to national county were 
referred to the liquidation office of the state board of insurance 
but walker has said he tried to save the company at the expense 
of his luxurious lifestyle 
i never kept money from the company he told the dallas 
business journal last fall adding that he expected to be accused of 
taking about 28 million from national county he said he offered to 
contribute 3 million to the company to help recapitalize it but 
the state turned him down 
walker told the journal national county was crippled by the loss 
of a reinsurance contract with dallasbased republic insurance group 
republic began providing reinsurance in 1984 for national county 
under a sevenyear contract that anticipated 15 million worth of 
business transferred to the reinsurer each year 
in 1985 national county transferred about 120 million in 
premiums to republic eight times the anticipated amount and 
republic suspended the contract a spokesman for the reinsurer said 
republics decision was upheld in courtordered arbitration 
which walker said rendered national county unable to maintain its 
insurance portfolio primarily automobile coverage to highrisk 
drivers 
republic which had honored previous reinsurance contracts with 
national county refused to enter another 
walker began cutting back national county took in more than 200 
million in premiums at its peak but was down to 50 million by the 
time state regulators took over last fall 
as the insurance companys troubles grew so did those in 
walkers other enterprises particularly real estate investments for 
which hed guaranteed payments before the energy collapse devastated 
the texas economy 
i would think that he did what almost every businessman in 
dallas on a big roll did when the tap went dry said nicholas 
ricco owner of diversified insurance systems inc of dallas 
hed just go to other taps that are available 
ricco said he and walker talked only a handful of times in the 
past five years but theyve known each other for 25 years 
this lack of integrity ive heard about goes against the 
grain ricco said i saw him honor agreements with everyone for 
years including me even to the detriment of himself 
the us postal inspectors office in dallas is leading a 
criminal investigation of national countys failure to determine if 
fraud was involved inspector jesse horton said 
walker is also embroiled in several lawsuits stemming from unpaid 
real estate loans and other soured investments

consolidated gold fields plc has rejected as 
inadequate a sweetened 57 billion hostile takeover offer by 
minorco sa 
the board intends to resist the bid strongly said 
consolidated gold fields chairman rudolph agnew who advised 
shareholders monday to take no action in response to the offer the 
largest bid ever for a british company 
this renewed bid which is of questionable value bears no 
relation to the underlying worth of the company and is clearly not 
meant to be taken seriously by shareholders agnew said 
under british takeover rules minorco the investment arm of the 
south african oppenheimer familys mining empire needed to renew 
its bid by thursday or risk having to wait till next fall to bid 
again by announcing its offer now minorco gets nearly three months 
to proceed with its takeover attempt 
the renewed bid follows approval friday by the european community 
commission which conducted an informal inquiry into whether the 
proposed acquisition of the gold mining group would result in a 
monopoly of platinum markets 
it also follows clearance by britains monopolies and mergers 
commission earlier this month minorcos original bid automatically 
lapsed when the matter was referred to the commission in october 
minorco faces at least one more major legal hurdle the offer is 
conditional on minorco winning its appeal against a us court 
injunction which blocked it from acquiring more than 30 percent of 
consolidated gold fields shares 
minorcos offer would top nestle sas 26 billionpound or 46 
billion purchase of british confectioner rowntree plc last year 
the latest bid is worth 14 pounds or 2478 a share in cash and 
stock for a total of 32 billion pounds or 57 billion minorcos 
previous offer was 1306 pounds or 2312 a share in cash and 
stock for a total of 29 billion pounds or 51 billion 
consolidated gold fields shares rose 8 pence to 1443 pounds on 
londons stock exchange monday suggesting that investors believed 
minorco eventually might make an even sweeter bid 
minorcos shares rose 10 pence to 766 pence 
most analysts were surprised by the latest bid having expected 
minorco to offer between 15 pounds and 16 pounds a share 
by putting forward a bid on the low side minorco might be buying 
time while it overcomes obstacles to the takeover analysts said 
minorcos latest offer isnt the end of the game said 
christopher spreckley a mining analyst at clalexanders laing and 
cruickshank there might be another pound per share in it 
minorco also might be hoping to force consolidated gold fields to 
disclose the price at which it values itself 
this is a sighting shot consolidated gold fields agnew 
said they dont know what to pay and they want to get our 
defenses open 
based in luxembourg minorco is 60 percentowned by the 
oppenheimers anglo american corp gold mining giant and the diamond 
mining group de beers consolidated mines ltd it already owns 296 
percent of consolidated gold fields shares 
part of consolidated gold fields defense in the past five months 
has been to raise objections to minorcos south african connections 
sir michael edwardes minorcos chief executive said we have 
now cleared all the uk and european regulatory hurdles put in 
minorcos way by the gold fields board 
minorco believes that the owners of gold fields should now be 
given the opportunity to consider the new offer on its merits and to 
determine the issues which affect them as shareholders he said 
minorco told the european commission it would sell all 
consolidated gold fields platinum interests should a takeover 
succeed 
minorco also has said it intends to sell other minority stakes 
held by consolidated gold fields including a 49percent stake in 
newmont mining corp of the united states 48 percent in renison 
goldfields consolidated ltd of australia and 38 percent in gold 
fields of south africa ltd 
this would leave minorco with consolidated gold fields arc 
construction materials businesses in britain and the united states 
and with gold fields mining corp in north america

the number of working oil and gas rigs increased 
this week by 20 to total 766 after plunging last week by 34 baker 
hughes inc reported tuesday 
a year ago the count totaled 978 last week the count was 746 
baker hughes reported tuesday 
baker hughes economist ike kerridge said the count usually drops 
off during late december through late march or early april 
the rig count is a widely watched industry index of drilling 
activity and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for 
oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a federal law primarily designed to compensate injured 
longshoremen also applies to railroad employees who work at dockside 
coalloading facilities 
the court in cases involving three injured workers in virginia 
said it will hear arguments by railroads seeking to protect 
themselves from potentially costly lawsuits 
the virginia supreme court ruled last year that the 
longshoremens and harbor workers compensation act does not cover 
the railroad employees 
instead the state court allowed three injured rail workers to 
seek potentially greater compensation under the federal employers 
liability act 
the railroads said the compensation provided by the 
longshoremens act should be the exclusive remedy for the three rail 
employees 
the workers are nancy j schwalb and william mcglone who did 
cleanup jobs for the chesapeake and ohio railway co and robert j 
goode jr a machinist for the norfolk and western railway co 
all three worked at coalloading terminals in the hampton roads 
va area 
ms schwalb suffered a serious head injury jan 11 1983 when 
she fell from a catwalk while going to a nearby area to pick up 
spilled coal mcglones arm was nearly severed as he was picking up 
coal from beneath a moving conveyor belt feb 1 1983 goode 
suffered a hand injury while repairing loading equipment feb 11 
1985 
the three sued the railroad company that employed them under the 
federal employers liability act 
lower courts in virginia threw out their lawsuits on grounds that 
the workers were doing jobs essential to the loading of coal at the 
terminals and thus were eligible for compensation only under the 
longshoremens act 
but the state supreme court reinstated the suits deciding the 
rail employees jobs were not covered by the longshoremens act 
justice department lawyers supported the railroads ensuing 
appeals to the nations highest court 
they said the three workers could get potentially lucrative 
albeit uncertain relief under the employers liability law 
but government lawyers said in other cases restricting the scope 
of the longshoremens act could mean workers in similar jobs would 
be forced to sue under state laws that provide less compensation for 
the injured 
that result would be plainly inconsistent with congress 
intent in 1972 when it amended the longshoremens law to expand 
its coverage the government lawyers said 
the association of american railroads also urged the supreme 
court to overrule the virginia court 
the association said its members employ some 300000 workers who 
if injured could sue them for compensation if the virginia court 
ruling were applied nationwide 
the cases are chesapeake and ohio vs schwalb 871979 and 
norfolk and western vs goode 88127

of fridays strong rally in the soybean market 
precipitation in some key growing areas during the 3day weekend 
also weighed on prices analysts said 
argentina a major south american soybean producer had its 
heaviest showers in several weeks while snow and rain improved the 
outlook for corn soybean and winterwheat production in the united 
states 
but the main factor in the decline appeared to be a bearish 
backlash after fridays runup which was not supported by 
significant changes in supplies or demand

the supreme court today rejected a prominent 
stock brokers challenge to the power of the securities and exchange 
commission to crack down on fraud 
the court without comment left intact rulings that meyer 
blinder and the brokerage firm he founded blinder robinson amp co 
say unfairly restrict their business activities 
the case stems from a civil sec enforcement action in 1980 
against blinder and his firm 
blinder began the business in westbury long island ny and 
moved its headquarters to denver in the late 1970s it became one of 
the nations leading underwriters of penny stocks or lowpriced 
securities 
the commission accused blinder and the firm of deceiving 
investors in underwriting a 25 million sale of stock in american 
leisure corp the stock sale was intended to finance construction 
and operation of a casino hotel in atlantic city nj 
us district judge richard p matsch in denver ruled in 1982 the 
firm defrauded investors by withholding important information 
including the real risks of the casino venture 
the judge said the firms sales force practiced a program of 
deliberately deceptive misinformation which meyer blinder 
orchestrated 
matsch issued an injunction permanently barring blinder and his 
firm from engaging in similar practices 
blinder went back to court in 1986 to have the injunction lifted 
he said he and the firm are rehabilitated noting that he had 
replaced his sales force since 1982 and had given millions of 
dollars to charity 
he also said the injunction was having dire unforeseen 
consequences on his business he said about a dozen states have 
taken steps to limit or ban blinder robinson from selling 
securities and the sec has imposed sanctions based on the court 
order 
blinder challenged the constitutionality of the secs enforcement 
powers in such cases blinder said it violates the separation of 
powers to permit the commission to enforce the laws because the sec 
is only partly accountable to the president 
commission members are appointed by the president with the 
consent of the senate and may be removed from office by the 
president for inefficiency neglect of duty or misconduct 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals last august refused to 
lift the injunction against the stock brokerage or its founder 
the appeals court rejected arguments that evidence of 
rehabilitation means the injunction no longer is needed to protect 
the public the appeals court also ruled that the secs powers do 
not violate the constitution 
the case is blinder robinson vs sec 88850

the computers are known as the u 600030 u 600070 and u 
600080 the u 600050 was announced last year members of the line 
cost from 11500 to 1 million and can serve up to 400 users at

ely joined unisys when it bought convergent inc of san jose 
calif in a 332 million transaction that was announced in august 
and completed in december he had been chairman and chief executive 
unisys has headquarters in blue bell pa and detroit 
the computer announcement came following last weeks statement 
that unisys planned to reduce its workforce of 93000 by 3 percent 
about 2800 people this year through layoffs and retirements the 
company also plans to cut back on swollen inventories 
unisyss statement about job cuts was made in response to a 
question at a security analysts meeting on thursday unisys 
spokesman j peter hynes said there was no formal announcement 
because the cutbacks were in line with previous steps 
since unisys was formed in 1986 through burroughs corps 48 
billion acquisition of sperry corp it has pared 18000 people from 
its payroll by selling off operations and cut 12000 more through 
early retirements and layoffs leaving it with 89500 employees 
last years acquisition of convergent added 3500 to the rolls 
unisys chairman w michael blumenthal acknowledged last week that 
1988 had been a tougher year than anticipated and he expected a 
weakness in sales to continue in the first half of 1989 
sales in 1988 increased just 2 percent from 1987 to 99 
billion although unisys profits rose about 18 percent in 1988 
most of the increase was attributable to lower tax rates not bigger 
profit margins the companys operating profits slumped nearly 
onequarter on the final quarter of 1988

labor secretary elizabeth dole today 
asked labor leaders for their help and guidance but said it was too 
early to respond to the aflcios request for intervention in an 
eastern airlines labor dispute 
i want a continued dialogue with the individuals in that room 
and certainly i want to have my door open and to be in touch with 
them regularly mrs dole said after meeting with the aflcio 
executive council 
in her statement to the council mrs dole said that to succeed 
in this mission let me say once again that i will need your help 
your guidance we may not always agree on the best way to resolve 
the issues before us but i assure you today that my door will 
always be open 
some of those disagreements were immediately apparent however 
mrs dole said the administration remains committed to a 
subminimum youth training wage as part of any attempt to increase 
the minimum wage labor leaders want the minimum wage raised but 
vehemently oppose the training wage and mrs dole said president 
bush opposes mandatory child care and parental leave policies both 
items on labors congressional agenda 
the executive council on monday opened its annual meeting by 
asking bush to appoint a presidential emergency board to mediate the 
dispute between eastern machinists and management such a move would 
delay a strike planned for march 4 by 60 days 
but mrs dole said it was premature to say whether bush would 
appoint a board saying he was awaiting a report from the national 
mediation board and legal advice from the labor and transportation 
departments 
aflcio president lane kirkland promised full support for the 
eastern machinists in the event of a strike 
the aflcio will mobilize its resources to assist the employees 
at eastern to the fullest possible support in the event the 
machinists are forced to strike kirkland said 
the call for bush to intervene in the 16month dispute before a 
march 4 strike deadline dominated the first day of the councils 
annual meeting 
the federations 35member governing body also issued several 
statements on its domestic policy agenda including calls for an 
increased minimum wage and legislation expanding the availability of 
child care and parental leave 
the eastern dispute could provide the first sign of the 
relationship the bush administration will have with labor 
kirkland said monday that the atmosphere of labors relations 
with the white house have improved since bush took office but added 
that that could change if bush rejects the machinists request for a 
presidential emergency board to mediate the dispute 
asked what his reaction would be if bush refused to name an 
emergency board kirkland said i think he would be sending a 
signal that he sides with one of the most irresponsible and 
avaricious employers in the country 
if bush did name such a panel it would automatically delay by 60 
days the strike deadline if no agreement was reached in that 
period the board would recommend a settlement congress has the 
power to force both eastern and the union to abide by it 
kirkland called on other unions to honor picket lines if the 
machinists strike but acknowledged that previous walkouts against 
airlines have failed because union workers particularly pilots 
have ignored pickets 
however kirkland and other union leaders spoke optimistically of 
the prospect of a unified union effort in the event of a strike 
saying unions that might otherwise have been reluctant to support 
the machinists likely would do so because of the antiunion record 
of frank lorenzo the chairman of easterns parent company texas 
air corp 
charles e bryan president of the miami district lodge of the 
machinists union said his plans for a strike included picketing 
and boycotting easterns sister carrier continental airlines and 
any other carriers that have service agreements with eastern 
continental or texas air 
those pickets also would include any carriers of cargo and 
baggage either destined for or already carried by eastern and 
continental including railroads bryan said 
he said there was no chance of a settlement before the march 4 
deadline eastern has demanded that the machinists accept wage cuts 
of 20 percent to nearly 50 percent as well was reductions in 
companypaid pension benefits 
eastern officials have said the airline would hire replacements 
and operate during any strike support from pilots would be vital to 
labors goal of preventing that 
ironically many of the union leaders here for the meeting 
traveled on eastern which offered the aflcio a group discount

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan today 
said inflationary pressures are unacceptable and that the central 
bank would continue fighting higher prices by driving up interest 
rates 
greenspans remarks could spell bad news for the bush 
administration which is counting on robust economic growth to 
reduce the federal budget deficit without the need to increase taxes 
greenspan released an economic forecast prepared by the central 
bank which showed growth significantly lower than the bush 
administrations estimate 
greenspans comments were made in testimony to the senate banking 
committee as part of the requirmeent that the central bank reveal 
its economic assumptions and monetary policy targets twice a year 
the central bank has been pushing interest rates higher in an 
effort to restrain domestic demand since march of last year an 
effort which has sent a variety of shortterm interest rates 
climbing by about 3 percentage points 
in his testimony greenspan discussed this effort and said the 
central bank remains more inclined to act in the direction of 
restraint on the supply of credit 
for the past two years consumer prices have increased 44 
percent annually a rate of increase which greenspan said was 
worrisome 
the wage and price process may have developed some momentum 
greenspan said citing reports showing that wage increases were 
rising at a faster clip because of the tight labor markets 
let met stress that the current rate of inflation let alone an 
increase is not acceptable and our policies are designed to reduce 
inflation in coming years he said this restraint will involve 
containing pressures on our productive resources and thus some 
slowing in the underlying rate of growth of the overall economy 
since taking office president bush has on several occasions said 
he believed the feds worries about inflation were misplaced saying 
he saw no need to push interest rates higher 
however the central bank has so far ignored those comments 
launching its latest credittightening effort just last week 
following a report on prices at the wholesale level which showed an 
unexpectedly sharp 1 percent increase in january 
in his report to congress greenspan said the fed was predicting 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
would expand by between 25 percent and 3 percent in 1989 the 
administration however is basing its budget on a forecast which 
expects growth to be a more robust 35 percent this year 
to support its move to restrain inflationary pressures greenspan 
said the central bank policymakers reaffirmed a decision made last 
summer to lower money growth targets for 1989 for m2 the measure 
of the money supply which includes currency in circulation and 
interestbearing checking accounts the fed said it would aim for an 
increase of between 3 percent and 7 percent down a full percentage 
point from the 1988 growth target 
greenspan said he understood that moves toward tightening the 
availability of money and driving up interest rates could have an 
adverse impact on the savings and loan crisis the third world debt 
situation and the debt problems of some american businesses 
but he said that backing away from policy adjustments needed to 
contain inflation would not solve the various problems and would 
put the overall economy in more trouble 
most private economists believe the fed has no choice but to keep 
tightening credit in an effort to dampen inflationary pressures 
even at the risk of another downturn 
bruce steinberg senior economist at merrill lynch in new york 
said he believed the fed has acted responsibly over the past year in 
gradually pushing interest rates higher in response to indications 
that excessive economic growth and tight labor markets were 
threatening to set off another inflationary spiral 
if you postpone the day of reckoning it will still come and it 
will be a lot harsher he said if inflation rises significantly 
above levels where it is now then interest rates would have to go 
much higher and the negative effects would be that much greater 
that is what occurred in the last economic downturn in 198182 
when thenfederal reserve chairman paul volcker pushed the prime 
rate up to a high of 215 percent in a battle to control the worst 
bout of inflation in this country since the civil war 
volcker won the struggle but not without plunging the country 
into the 198182 recession the worst downturn since the great 
depression

three days after being closed on monday in observance of the 
presidents day holiday 
the stock market finished strongly last week with three 
consecutive gains lifting the dow jones industrial average by more 
than 43 points 
while some analysts say the market should extend those gains this 
week others say concerns about interest rates could limit any price 
advance 
on that score traders were closely following reports of federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspans testimony today before the senate 
banking committee 
larry wachtel a vice president at prudentialbache securities 
inc said greenspan appeared to repeat earlier assertions that the 
fed would lean toward restraint to curb inflation 
wachtel said that after last weeks gains the stock market was 
ready for a bit of a pullback it is more a lack of buyers than an 
abundance of sellers

panhandle eastern corp began a cash tender offer 
today for texas eastern corps outstanding stock after topping a 
hostile bid for the houstonbased natural gas company by much larger 
rival coastal corp 
under the 32 billion deal panhandle plans to buy up to 80 
percent of texas easterns 608 million outstanding shares at 53 
each said panhandle spokesman jim hart 
shares not purchased under the cash offer would be exchanged for 
panhandle eastern stock at the same 53 a share hart said 
the agreement subject to approval by federal regulators was 
accepted by the texas eastern board monday afternoon just hours 
after the 32 billion offer was approved by panhandle easterns 
board of directors 
the combination of the two houstonbased natural gas companies 
would create a 27000mile pipeline system the nations 
secondlargest in total miles behind enron corp also of houston 
coastal corp spokesman will osterloh said his company would 
study the panhandle eastern offer before deciding whether to 
continue its 26 billion bid for texas eastern 
we are going to consider our options including possibly 
raising our offer dropping our bid or other courses of action open 
to us osterloh said adding that the company may have more to say 
on the development later today 
texas easterns stock soared 4 a share to 5250 in early new 
york stock exchange trading today 
in addition to the prospect of a significantly higher dividend 
it will enable texas eastern stockholders to participate in the 
future of a combined operation that will be enhanced by the synergy 
and efficiencies of the merger said dennis r hendrix the 
companys chairman and chief executive officer 
the panhandle eastern bid came five weeks after coastal offered 
26 billion or 42 a share that offer was rejected by texas 
eastern officials who believed the company could fetch a higher 
price 
we expect the combination of the two companies to result in 
significant operating synergies and appreciably enhanced operating 
income of the combined companies starting in 1990 said robert 
hunsucker chairman president and chief executive officer for 
panhandle eastern 
panhandle eastern has access to large midcontinent supplies of 
natural gas in texas oklahoma kansas and the gulf of mexico and 
also operates a large liquefied natural gas facility in lake 
charles la 
the company also has connections to canadian gas through the 
northern border pipeline hart said while texas eastern has access 
to the rapidly growing new england natural gas market 
the combined systems will provide access to almost all the 
major gas processing markets in the nation said texas eastern 
spokesman fred wichlep 
texas eastern officials said monday they had talked to several 
interested companies since coastals surprise takeover bid was 
announced jan 16 but would not disclose the number or the 
seriousness of other inquiries 
however hendrix said the panhandle eastern bid which included 
provisions for a share exchange was by far the superior offer 
the purchase price is approximately 650 million higher than 
the coastal corps tender offer which our directors determined as 
inadequate and advised our stockholders to reject he said 
also on monday us district judge lynn hughes in houston 
dissolved an injunction designed to prevent texas eastern from 
deploying antitakeover measures in other courts 
hughes said coastal misrepresented facts when it said at the time 
of a preliminary hearing on its requested injunction that it was not 
involved in litigation elsewhere 
coastal issued a brief statement monday which said the 
dissolution of the injunction should not have any impact on 
coastals court case because the 5th circuit court of appeals had 
stayed the injunction back on jan 29 1989 
wichlep of texas eastern said hughes action means we are 
free to take any legal matters that may arise subsequently to the 
delaware court or any other court

the dollar ended mixed tuesday in choppy european 
trading losing early gains when us federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan signaled no significant change in american monetary 
policy gold prices rose 
dealers said greenspan did not say anything new or surprising in 
his testimony to the us senates banking committee but many 
regarded his comments as less aggressively bullish than had been 
expected 
us monetary policy remains unchanged said a dealer in 
frankfurt west germany it looks like further interest rate 
increases are out of the question for the time being 
greenspan called for financial restraints to prevent further 
rises in inflation but said us monetary policy appears to be on 
track and that he expected the dollar to remain stable for some 
months 
the dollar had gained in asian and early european dealings on 
expectations that greenspan would strongly emphasize the feds 
commitment to fighting inflation dealers said 
ultimately the market actually wants to see higher interest 
rates rather than just forecast that they will materialize said a 
senior dealer in london

grain and soybean futures closed narrowly mixed 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade after a late surge of buying 
by commercial interests erased losses that prevailed for most of the 
session 
the buying may have reflected a desire of grain handlers and 
processors to lock in their supply costs at current levels and avoid 
a sudden runup in prices like the one that ended fridays session 
but analysts also said much of the days activity was motivated 
by technical traders interpretations of recent chart patterns 
the session opened on a low note after the 3day weekend with 
much of the selling attributed to improved growing conditions for 
the south american soybean crop and weekend precipitation in some 
key us crop regions 
at the close wheat was cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
march at 424 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents lower with 
march at 269 a bushel oats were unchanged to 6 cents higher 
with march at 212 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 2 cents 
higher with march at 746 a bushel

the supreme court on tuesday told federal judges to toughen their 
reviews of decisions by pension and welfare plans that deny benefits 
to workers 
federal judges must evaluate the cases just as if the pension and 
welfare plan officials had not yet made any decision the justices 
said in a unanimous ruling in a case involving firestone tire amp 
rubber co 
the justices said federal courts have been employing a less 
stringent standard of review generally not disturbing decisions by 
plan officials unless they are found to be arbitrary or 
capricious 
the dispute stemmed from firestones sale of its plastics 
division in 1980 to occidental petroleum corp last year japans 
bridgestone corp paid 26 billion to acquire firestone 
in other cases involving business the supreme court clarified 
how federal copyright and patent laws apply to states rejected an 
appeal by mining companies in a hazardouswaste case rejected a 
challenge to the securities and exchange commissions crackdown on 
fraud and limited the ability of people to seek additional damages 
after winning a lawsuit 
the court refused to let states and state agencies be sued for 
alleged violations of federal copyright law it turned away a 
radford va case that highlighted a conflict between the 
constitutions 11th amendment shielding states from federal lawsuits 
and copyright law requiring all suits be filed in federal court 
photographer richard anderson had sued radford university a 
staterun school and some school officials over the unauthorized 
use in 1982 of copyright photographs 
the court unanimously ruled that states may not offer the 
equivalent of patent protection for utilitarian and design ideas 
left unprotected by federal law the justices killed a lawsuit in 
which a florida boat manufacturer charged that its design for a 
fiberglass recreational boat was duplicated illegally by a 
competitor 
the court said only congress and not individual states can 
decide at some future date to protect certain industrial design 
ideas 
the justices rejected an appeal by mining companies seeking an 
exemption from federal environmental rules for certain hazardous 
wastes the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
environmental protection agency must regulate the wastes 
the us circuit court of appeals ruled last july that a 1980 
federal law exempting some high volume low hazard mining wastes 
from environmental rules does not apply to certain types of waste 
produced from smelting 
the high court rejected a prominent stockbrokers challenge to 
the marketpolicing power of the sec the court without comment 
left intact rulings contested by meyer blinder and the brokerage 
firm he founded blinder robinson amp co 
the case stems from a civil sec enforcement action in 1980 
against blinder and his firm 
the justices in a case involving alleged fraud in a 20yearold 
business merger limited the ability of people to seek additional 
damages after winning a lawsuit the 90 ruling in a case from 
georgia restricts the ability of purported fraud victims to sue a 
leading accounting firm ernst amp whinney which they accused of 
preparing inflated financial statements 
the case arose out of the 1969 merger of cavalier bag co and 
et barwick industries inc the owners of cavalier bag won a 
lawsuit against officials of barwick but lost their case against 
ernst amp whinney they were prohibited from appealing the loss to 
ernst amp whinney while simultaneously seeking additional interest 
payments from officials of barwick

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
tuesday the central bank will keep up its inflationfighting efforts 
by pushing interest rates higher to combat what he termed a 
troubling acceleration in price pressures 
greenspan in his semiannual report to congress on monetary 
policy said the fed expects to support continued economic 
expansion while putting in place conditions for a gradual easing in 
the rate of inflation over time 
he added however 
let me stress that the current rate of inflation let alone an 
increase is not acceptable and our policies are designed to reduce 
inflation in coming years 
since last march the fed has been nudging up interest rates in 
an attempt to slow economic growth and avoid a flareup of 
inflation those efforts intensified last week after a report on 
prices at the wholesale level showed a 1 percent increase during the 
month of january equivalent to a compounded annual inflation rate 
of 127 percent 
prices at the consumer level in 1988 increased by 44 percent 
the same pace as during the previous year and a rate that greenspan 
considers worrisome 
with the economy running close to its potential the risks seem 
to be on the side of a further strengthening of prices pressures 
the fed chairman said in these circumstances the federal reserve 
remains more inclined to act in the direction of restraint than 
toward stimulus 
greenspan said the feds alwayschallenging task of charting 
monetary policy has been made more difficult by the unprecedented 
combination of an aging economic recovery financial failures in the 
savings and loan industry rising levels of corporate debt and the 
large trade and budget deficits 
we have never confronted a situation that is exactly comparable 
to what we are in at this particular stage he said 
greenspan said the problems are so large that it very 
significantly skews policy toward reducing the budget deficit and 
making certain that inflation does not accelerate 
its clear to me that much of the problems that we are 
confronted with could be assisted in an extremely positive way by a 
very expeditious and significant cut in the deficit he said i 
am not one of those who believes that the process of cutting the 
deficit can be overdone 
congressional leaders met with president bush on tuesday to 
discuss budget and deficitreduction plans but legislators still 
were hoping the administration would provide more details on where 
it believes spending can be reduced 
greenspan said he remained optimistic that an agreement could be 
reached 
we cannot take the risk of not resolving it he said the 
degree of risk of allowing this whole process to fester is 
unacceptable 
analysts said that while greenspans testimony before the senate 
banking committee demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the fight 
against inflation financial markets had hoped for something even 
stronger 
its a matter of tone but the markets would have preferred a 
little more antiinflation vigor said economist david wyss of 
data resources inc in lexington mass 
added economist david jones of aubrey g langston amp co in new 
york in view of the new and disturbing evidence on inflation 
the markets were expecting some even tougher talk from the fed 
chairman 
theres a general perception that maybe the fed is falling a 
bit behind the inflation curve jones said 
bush in recent weeks has voiced fear that the fed would overreact 
to concerns about inflation saying he saw no need for the central 
bank to push interest rates higher 
the fed has been pushing up shortterm interest rates by a 
behindthescenes process that siphons off available bank reserves 
this tightening of the money supply drives up the cost of that money 
interest rates 
but while the fed nevertheless has continued to push up interest 
rates greenspan in his testimony played down his differences with 
the bush administration particularly on assumptions for future 
economic growth 
the fed expects the economy as measured by the gross national 
product to expand 25 percent to 3 percent in 1989 the 
administration meanwhile forecasts growth of 35 percent this year 
and is counting on shortterm interest rates to gradually decline 
the banking committee chairman sen donald riegle dmich 
called the administrations rosy outlook startling and 
questioned whether it was realistic but greenspan said the bush 
forecast was reasonable considering the administrations 
deficitreduction and budget plans 
greenspan also refused to criticize the administrations proposal 
to reduce the capital gains tax as a way to stimulate investment and 
generate more revenue 
greenspan said that the treasury departments revenue projections 
are credible and that he would like to see the capital gains tax 
rate lowered so long as the reduction is not accompanied by tax 
increases elsewhere

frank lorenzo the toughasnails chairman of 
giant texas air corp has a masters degree in business 
administration from harvard university 
so does wright b george who flies planes for eastern airlines 
the besieged carrier owned by texas air 
the two are on opposite sides of a bitter escalating conflict 
that could result in a march 4 strike by the airlines machinists 
union which the eastern pilots and flight attendants have pledged 
to honor 
george a member of the master executive council of the pilots 
union at miamibased eastern is spreading the union gospel about 
eastern and lorenzo to wall street analysts creditors of the 
strapped airline and the public 
the campaign is aimed at forcing lorenzo to sign what george 
called acceptable contracts with the machinists pilots and flight 
attendants at eastern 
george 46 doesnt pull punches hes going after his 
costcutting boss with nearly the same fervor he showed flying 
combat support missions as an air force captain in vietnam 
lorenzo is looking at the abyss the evil empire is 
tottering he said in a recent interview in new york we 
understand the risk of striking the worst thing that can happen 
to us is that we lose our jobs 
that risk appears real many financial analysts and other 
observers believe a strike against eastern could jeopardize the 
airlines survival 
eastern recently reported a record net loss of 3354 million in 
1988 nearly double its 1817 million loss the year before revenue 
dropped to 38 billion from 44 billion in 1987 
the airlines latest contract offer rejected by the machinists 
calls for 150 million in wage cuts 
eastern spokesman robin matell said no eastern officials wished 
to comment on george or his activities 
george harvard business school class of 74 calls lorenzo 
class of 63 a financial genius but a business moron 
george has organized a presentation for wall street analysts and 
eastern creditors in new york on wednesday the same day 
intensified talks involving eastern management the machinists and 
federal mediators are set to start in washington 
among other things george said the pilots and their financial 
consultants plan to warn the airlines creditors of the risk to them 
if eastern is hit by a strike 
george who is a manager of the eastern pilots pension fund 
masterminded a session with analysts last september he also was a 
prime organizer of a demonstration against lorenzo later that month 
at the 25th reunion of lorenzos harvard business school class in 
cambridge mass the rev jesse jackson jr was among the speakers 
addressing the rally 
how did an eagle scout and church altar boy from rural illinois 
arrive at center stage in the highstakes conflict 
im a pilot and im basically fighting for the profession 
said george who manages to look like a boxer ivy league banker and 
farm boy this profession is in a death struggle with mr 
lorenzo 
sitting in the paneled mahogany caverns of the harvard club in 
midtown manhattan he seems more culturally akin to the corporate 
dealmakers he assails than the mechanics and baggage handlers he 
supports 
george grew up on a farm in sycamore ill studied mathematics 
and economics at the university of wisconsin and later flew support 
missions in vietnam evacuating casualties 
after his air force service from 1967 to 1971 george attended 
harvard while starting to fly for eastern getting his mba in 1974 
wall street was the next move but he didnt stay there long 
i had a brief but mediocre career he said referring to his 
stint at bankers trust co i dont particularly like being tied to 
a desk 
but george does like flying he left the desks of wall street to 
return to the cockpits of eastern in 1974 and has been flying for 
the carrier ever since hes clocked around 10000 hours of flight 
time he reckons on domestic routes and in latin america 
his jabs at lorenzo arent all deadly serious at the pilots 
meeting with financial analysts last september george caught the 
attention of the normally blase analysts and news reporters by 
bouncing a striped beach ball during his opening remarks 
mr lorenzo agreed to cater the meal today he told the 
participants solemnly as waiters proceeded to serve peanuts from 
silver trays

corrupt and should be regulated by congress

loans with the companys cash flow or by selling its assets

zenith electronics corp the only domestic 
television maker reported the first annual profit in four years 
tuesday attributing the performance to booming computer sales and 
modest growth in its consumer electronics division 
some industry analysts said the 117 million in 1988 net income 
could mark a turning point in the companys fortunes 
but chairman jerry pearlman said zeniths management was 
continuing to explore all avenues including selling all or part of 
the consumer electronics business to keep the company profitable 
we are mindful of our responsibilities to our shareholders to 
increase the value of their investment in zenith pearlman said in 
a statement we have not ruled anything out 
zenith reported net income for the fourth quarter of 204 
million or 78 cents a share compared with 47 million or 18 
cents a share for the last three months of 1987 
sales for the period totaled 841 million a 23 percent increase 
from fourthquarter 1987 sales of 686 million 
the results included a onetime gain of 64 million which 
represented a reduction in income taxes from operating losses that 
were carried forward from the previous year 
zeniths fullyear net income of 117 million or 45 cents a 
share compared with a net loss of 191 million in 1987 zenith 
lost 10 million in 1986 and 77 million in 1985 in 1984 its last 
profitable year the company had net income of 636 million 
zeniths sales for all of 1988 totaled 27 billion up 14 
percent from 1987 sales of 24 billion 
sales of zeniths highly regarded computer systems and components 
climbed 23 percent in 1988 to nearly 16 billion while revenues 
from the recovering consumer electronics division rose 27 percent 
to 11 billion 
zenith had said in october that it expected to show a pretax 
profit in 1988 but several industry analysts said they were 
surprised the company did better than break even after taxes 
im encouraged by the results said julian menear an analyst 
with the new york investment firm pershing amp co theyve got some 
difficulties ahead but this shows they are able to make money in 
consumer electronics 
charles ryan of merrill lynch amp co in new york said the 1988 
earnings signaled a major improvement in zeniths tv and 
videoequipment business he predicted further gains for that 
segment in 1989 as prices rise and more us consumers opt for the 
pricey largescreen and stereo tv sets that zenith produces with 
great efficiency 
but james magid of needham amp co was less enthusiastic about 
zeniths future 
there is no reason to suppose this is a major turning point 
he said from new york 
zeniths tv business nosedived in the mid1980s as a flood of 
lowpriced south koreanmade televisions reached us markets 
joining the lowpriced japanese models already on shelves zenith 
recently asked the commerce department to monitor imports for 
illegal dumping of tv sets at unfairly low prices 
since 1985 the company has concentrated on increasing its 
manufacturing efficiency through employee reductions and plant 
consolidations 
those moves put the company in an ideal position to profit from 
the increased demand for usmade products that has resulted from 
the dollars plunge in value against foreign currencies 
at the same time chinese demand for televisions has increased 
dramatically with the opening of that country to foreign trade 
creating a worldwide shortage of picture tubes 
zenith has benefited from the tightsupply situation which is 
not expected to ease this year and the company announced last week 
it was hiring 600 people at its picturetube plant in the chicago 
suburb of melrose park to increase production 
the company also is working on a highdefinition television 
system that it hopes the government will select as the us standard 
for the new technology that would bring zenith lucrative patent 
royalties 
despite these positive signs analysts said zenith still lags 
behind foreign producers in sales of portable television with 
screens measuring less than 19 inches diagonally a market that 
constitutes a large chunk of us demand

several independent oil producing countries said 
tuesday they would cut or freeze oil exports during the second 
quarter to help opec support world oil prices 
the nonopec group after a daylong meeting in london released a 
statement saying more information was forthcoming but did not 
disclose details of the agreement or say which countries would 
participate 
specific announcements with respect to the above decisions will 
be made by the respective authorities in the course of next week 
the group said in a statement 
participating in the talks at the mexican embassy were mexico 
oman malaysia egypt china and angola the communique said also 
attending were observers from the soviet union colombia north 
yemen norway alaska and the canadian province of alberta it said 
oil analysts said the agreement would help bolster oil prices in 
the shortterm but they added that such cuts would have little 
impact on the buoyant supply and weak demand in the oil market 
there was little immediate reaction in the london oil market 
after the communique was released the spot price of north sea brent 
blend the most widely traded international crude oil was 1630 a 
barrel up 10 cents from late monday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude fell by about 
15 cents following the announcement 
analysts said the lack of details about the agreement pressured 
the market 
the agreement is fairly significant said philip morgan an 
oil analyst with the london investment firm citicorp scrimgeour 
vickers i think it means the extension of the oil producers 
cartel even if the countries dont want to commit themselves to 
opec at this stage 
it also was significant that the independent producers were 
acting unilaterally analysts said they were doing so because the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries has managed to curb 
its production they said 
last year independent oil producers offered to cut their output 
by 5 percent if opec agreed to reciprocal cuts opec refused 
some opec members have expressed resentment that independent 
producers enjoy the benefits of the cartels production limits 
without making a contribution 
opecs 13 members are estimated to be producing about 195 
million barrels a day one million barrels above their agreed 
production limit but well below their fourthquarter production 
opec has set a target price of 18 a barrel 
the psychological impact on the oil markets will be quite 
strong morgan said but i think the total volume of the cuts 
makes little difference to the whole supply and demand question 
james henderson an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd ltd in 
london said basically we see it as fairly positive for the oil 
price shortterm 
basically it will help opec through the seasonal demand 
downturn in the second quarter we still see a dip in the oil price 
but not as dramatically as it would have been 
henderson predicted oil prices would fall to 1450 to 15 a 
barrel in march and april 
the analyst said he expects the independent producers to cut 
exports by between 200000 and 300000 barrels a day 
a cut of 100000 cq to 300000 isnt going to have a dramatic 
effect on the supply and demand balance henderson said 
the communique also said some participants will go back to 
their authorities for further consultations in order to determine 
their contribution 
further meetings of technical experts will be convened on a 
regular basis in order to monitor the evolution of the market 
situation as well as compliance with the agreement the statement 
said 
the group set may 16 for the next meetig to address the 
prospects of the second half of the year a period viewed by the 
experts with caution 
individual delegates would not elaborate when they emerged from 
the meeting

manufacturers hanover trust co said tuesday a 
vice president in its government bond trading department lost 14 
million for the bank last year through unauthorized secret dealings 
in canadian bonds 
the bank refused to identify the individual but said the person 
has been relieved of his or her duties 
the bank said the loss discovered earlier this month in a 
routine review caused it to reduce its reported profit for 1988 by 
14 percent to 952 million instead of 966 million as reported in 
a january news release 
the employee is not only very experienced but clever and 
sophisticated said john stefans a bank spokesman he said the 
person had been with manufacturers hanover about five years and in 
the business about 20 years 
the vice president without authorization bought about 600 
million worth of canadian federal and provincial bonds over at least 
a year mainly in the final weeks of 1988 stefans said 
to conceal the transactions the person put them in the banks 
investment account instead of its trading account stefans said 
securities held in the investment account are carried on the 
books at what they cost when the securities were moved to the 
trading account where they belonged they had to be booked at their 
lower market value resulting in the 14 million loss stefans said 
stefans said the bank had been in contact with the federal 
reserve and the new york state banking department he said it has 
not yet been determined whether to lodge civil or criminal charges 
against the executive 
the bank has reviewed its procedures for preventing unauthorized 
trading stefans said but he added a sophisticated enough 
person for a particular period of time if intent on doing 
something can probably get away with it 
everybody on the floor was surprised when word of the 
unauthorized trading got out said bill pike who is in charge of 
us treasury bond and municipal bond trading 
in addition to the correction in fullyear earnings the bank cut 
its reported earnings for the fourth quarter by 14 million to 210 
million from 224 million the earnings did not have to be formally 
restated because they had never been officially stated only put out 
in a press release stefans said 
losses from unauthorized trading in recent years have prompted 
scrutiny of management controls at some wall street firms the giant 
investment firm merrill lynch amp co reorganized its mortgage 
securities unit after unauthorized trading in a risky form of 
security caused a 275 million pretax loss in april 1987

copper futures prices posted their sharpest gains in three months 
tuesday as reports of floodrelated mining disruptions in zambia 
refocused attention on the difficulties faced by many third world 
copper producers 
on other markets gold futures rose sharply cotton futures 
soared livestock and meat futures rallied grains and soybeans were 
mixed and energy futures were mostly lower 
copper futures settled 29 cents to 83 cents higher on new 
yorks commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in march at 
1345 a pound representing a oneday gain of nearly 66 percent in 
the contracts value 
the concerns raised by flooding at a zambia consolidated copper 
mines ltd facility spread well beyond the implications for copper 
output from zambia the worlds fourthlargest copper producer 
the incident served to remind traders of the strain on copper 
producers in africa latin america and asia as they strive to catch 
up with the demand created by the strong economies of the 
industrialized world 
copper production hurdles and labor difficulties have cropped up 
during the past year in peru and chile while the major african 
coppper countries have struggled with transportation problems 
those factors helped push copper futures prices to the record 
high of 16475 reached on dec 8 but production concerns have 
faded in recent weeks as copper stockpiles increased 
a market is very much a forum for changes in sentiment said 
george anagnos a metals analyst with thomson mckinnon securities 
inc in new york the flooding was important but it also focused 
peoples attention on broad output problems throughout the third 
world 
the london metal exchange on monday reported a 1750metricton 
decrease last week in its warehouse stocks of copper to 85025 
metric tons anagnos said the market had been expecting an increase 
of more than 5000 metric tons 
gold futures advanced strongly on the commodity exchange 
following federal reserve board chairman alan greenspans testimony 
before the senate banking committee 
analysts said greenspan was perceived as being too soft on 
inflation gold is often seen as an investment hedge against 
inflation 
gold settled 510 to 560 higher with april at 38940 a troy 
ounce silver settled 05 cent lower to 01 cent higher with march 
at 5935 a troy ounce 
cotton futures rallied on reports that the plains cotton 
cooperative in lubbock texas had sold from 250000 to 300000 
bales of cotton an unusually large amount to unknown destinations 
cotton settled 88 cent to 154 cents higher with march at 5857 
cents a pound 
feeder cattle led the livestock and meat futures markets higher 
on the chicago mercantile exchange in reaction to continued strong 
demand among meat packers for fattened cattle 
live cattle settled 28 cent to 83 cent higher with april at 
7775 cents a pound feeder cattle were 70 cent to 135 cents 
higher with march at 8430 cents a pound live hogs were 35 cent to 
1 cent higher with april at 4282 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 45 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with february at 3932 
cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade after a late surge of buying by commercial interests 
erased the losses that had held sway for most of the session 
wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with march at 425 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents lower to cent higher with march at 269 
a bushel oats were cent to 7 cents higher with march at 213 a 
bushel soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents higher with march at 
746 a bushel 
energy futures prices finished mostly lower on the new york 
mercantile exchange in nervous trading while traders kept one eye on 
a london meeting of oil ministers from nonopec countries 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 13 cent lower to 03 
cent higher with march at 1859 a barrel heating oil was 27 cent 
to 98 cent lower with march at 4892 cents a gallon unleaded

investorowned utility to seek bankruptcy protection since the great 
depression debt from its 36 percent share of the stalled seabrook 
nuclear power project forced public service to seek bankruptcy 
refuge 
in large measure the rise in the shares reflects investors 
faith that psnh and its common stock will revive when the 
company finally emerges from chapter 11 fry wrote 
but at least for common stockholders that faith isnt likely 
to be rewarded fry wrote 
quite the contrary holders of the companys common 
stockholders could find themselves with totally worthless paper 
when psnh comes out of chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code 
that is because public services liabilities exceed the market 
value of its assets fry explained and under bankruptcy law 
bondholders and other senior claims must be paid in full before 
lesser claims may receive any compensation 
public service has secured and unsecured obligations of nearly 
2 billion it also has nearly 500 million of liquidating value of 
preferred stock which takes priority in a reorganization against 
the obligations the company has a conventional utility plant with a 
book value of about 650 million and its investment in seabrook 
fry wrote 
he noted that it remains uncertain whether seabrook ever will be 
allowed to operate commercially and even if it does public service 
is unlikely to recover what it has invested in the reactor 
even an acquisition offer by northeast utilities of connecticut 
estimated to be worth 2 billion if seabrook operates would leave 
nothing for preferred stockholders much less common stockholders 
fry said 
its extremely speculative to think that common shareholders 
will get anything at all in a reorganization fry concluded so 
if you have an uncontrollable urge to speculate in psnh its bonds 
appear to be a much more rational vehicle

throughout the session on various opecrelated rumors they said

organization of petroleum exporting countries meeting in london 
released a statement saying some producers had agreed to either cut 
or freeze exports during the second quarter of 1989 to help 
stabilize world prices 
however the group said it would not disclose details of the 
agreement until next week which created uncertainty and pressured 
prices analysts said its disappointing because investors were

energy investments at prudentialbache securities inc as long as 
they dont know its difficult to say what the bottom line is so 
the market sold off

will be minimal and probably will not alter the current 
supplydemand balance since opec reduced its production by 3 
million barrels daily at the start of the year prices have risen

compaq computer corp announced tuesday it no 
longer will market its products through businessland inc stores in 
the wake of a dispute with the huge retail chain 
it has become apparent to us that continuing our relationship 
with businessland is not in the best interest of compaq or our 
customers said michael s swavely vice president of sales and 
marketing for houstonbased compaq 
businessland last year accounted for about 7 percent of the 21 
billion in annual revenue for compaq a leading maker of desktop 
laptop and portable personsal computers 
at the same time sales of compaq products accounted for about 15 
percent of the 872 million in net sales during fiscal 1988 for 
businessland which is based in san jose calif 
swavely said businessland had requested a business relationship 
in which the companies would have been strategic partners 
swavely said that would have required compaq to give businessland 
company preferential treatment swavely said compaq hasnt given it 
and businessland has elected not to support compaq he said 
simply put businessland has repeatedly requested special 
treatment that would give them an advantage over other authorized 
dealers compaq remains committed to the philosophy that authorized 
dealers should be treated fairly and equally he said 
compaq spokesman bob beach said businessland over time kept 
asking ask compaq for preferential treatment in terms of profit 
margins certain support systems and other areas beach said he 
could not provide specifics 
compaqs announcement surprised businessland officials 
businessland issued a statement saying that it was in compliance 
with compaqs authorized dealer agreement and that compaqs 
notification was unforeseen 
suzanne crocker businesslands vice president for marketing and 
communications said the retailer had asked compaq to reimburse it 
for some of the cost of giving technical support to buyers of compaq 
computers she said businessland has such arrangements with other 
computer makers 
adding to tension between compaq and businessland david a 
norman businesslands chairman and chief executive told securities 
analysts two weeks ago that businessland would put the bulk of its 
technical support behind computers such as international business 
machines corps personal system2 line that are built on micro 
channel architecture 
that was a rebuff to compaq which is working with other ibm 
rivals on an alternative to micro channel called extended industry 
standard architecture 
micro channel is the best solution for the future given what we 
know today ms crocker said tuesday 
the agreement between compaq and businessland which has been in 
effect since 1983 will terminate effective april 21 
i think on a shortterm basis businessland will sell their 
current inventory and that may have a shortterm negative pricing 
effect on compaq said richard w davis ana analyst with advest 
group inc 
but businessland officials say they are confident the addition of 
new vendors and continuing sales of other products will restore 
revenue 
swavely said the company anticipates compaq customers to move 
their business to other dealers 
compaq informed businessland of its decision monday swavely said 
several compaq dealers have been deauthorized during the past six 
years 
the action is specific to this single dealer and as such 
does not indicate any change in compaqs strategic commitment to its 
other dealers swavely said 
for 1988 compaq had record sales of 21 billion up from 12 
billion in 1987 the company also had a record net income of 255 
million for 1988 up from 136 million in 1987

labor secretary elizabeth dole on 
tuesday promised to work with labor and piqued the interest of union 
leaders by calling for a flexible pension system but she also 
disagreed with them on several issues 
the tone of the first meeting between the aflcio executive 
council and mrs dole was amiable despite the differences a stark 
contrast with the first such session of the reagan presidency when 
thenlabor secretary raymond donovan and the union leaders clashed 
publicly over the presidents economic plans 
there was no such acrimony after the meeting with mrs dole 
although federation president lane kirkland said it was inevitable 
that labor would disagree with the bush administration on some 
issues 
i want continued dialogue with the individuals in that room and 
certanly i want to leave my door open and be in touch with them 
mrs dole said after her private meeting with the 35member council 
while mrs dole represented the republican administration at the 
meeting new democratic party chairman ronald h brown also was in 
florida to address the aflcios political committee 
brown said he briefed the labor leaders on party efforts to gain 
500 seats in state legislatures by 1990 and 100 more by 1992 an 
effort to increase the number of state legislatures 28 in which 
democrats control all chambers 
labors got an extremely important role in the party brown 
said after the meeting labor has important political tentacles 
around the country it can be very important in electing democrats 
at a meeting with reporters mrs dole raised a proposal to allow 
workers who change jobs to carry pension funds with them she said 
that the administration was studying the issue and that she asked 
the labor leaders for their input 
kirkland said the federation welcomed her interest and would 
cooperate 
an early disagreement likely will be on congressional proposals 
to raise the minimum wage mrs dole said bush would support that if 
the legislation also carried a subminimum training wage for youths 
kirkland said the aflcio opposes the lower wage 
other areas of apparent disagreement are child care and parental 
leave with the administration favoring voluntary policies that 
might include tax credits labor backs democratsponsored bills that 
mandate some programs 
we never signed on for a honeymoon kirkland said when asked 
to assess labors early relations with the bush administration 
its early on and we have yet to see what issues or areas we 
can cooperate on im quite certain there will be some where we 
disagree 
the meeting with mrs dole came on the second day of the annual 
weeklong meeting of the governing body of the 19 millionmember 
federation

polaroid corp began a 11 billion stock 
buyback tuesday and said the plan may include 325 million in 
privately negotiated share purchases a move some analysts said was 
aimed at the companys hostile suitor 
the instant camera maker which announced jan 30 that it would 
undertake the buyback began a cash tender offer for 16 million 
shares at 50 a share in addition polaroid said it would 
repurchase 325 million of its stock on the open market or in 
privately negotiated purchases 
the offer of private negotiations was seen by some as an 
invitation to shamrock holdings inc of burbank calif which holds 
a 67 percent stake in polaroid and is pursuing a 32 billion 
hostile takeover of the company 
theyre leaving the door wide open for greenmail said alex 
henderson an analyst with prudentialbache securities in new york 
i cant think of any other privately held block of stock other 
than shamrocks that would be negotiated individually 
greenmail is the practice of buying back shares held by a 
corporate raider at a premium compared with the market price in 
order to thwart a potential or actual hostile bid critics say the 
practice favors raiders at the expense of other stockholders 
but some wall street analysts said polaroid seemed to be making 
an effort to placate its stockholders by offering a premium for some 
of their shares 
polaroids buyback offer of 50 a share is 5 over shamrocks 
last bid and 625 above fridays closing price for polaroid shares 
on the new york stock exchange 
on tuesday polaroid stock fell 37 cents to close at 4337 a 
share 
charles k ryan an analyst for merrill lynch capital markets 
said the drop reflected anxiety about the possibility of greenmail 
polaroids announcement is good for 30 percent of the stock and 
bad for 70 percent ryan said it does provide shareholder value 
for some of the shares but if they remove shamrock by doing this 
the remaining shares could decline in value 
shamrock called the buyback a further attempt at entrenchment by 
polaroids management 
we believe that polaroids partial buyback is a far leass 
attractive alternative than shamrocks 45 cash offer for all 
polaroid shares shamrock president stanley p gold said in a 
statement 
shamrock a television and radio concern owned by the roy e 
disney family owns about 48 million shares of polaroid and is 
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the 
may 9 annual meeting in addition to its hostile tender offer 
polaroid has been resisting shamrock since the california company 
made a friendly but unsolicited offer of 40 a share last july in 
september shamrock launched a hostile offer of 42 per share last 
month it boosted that offer to 45 
polaroid last july put 97 million shares into an employee stock 
ownership plan in january the company announced a recapitalization 
plan that included selling 300 million of preferred stock to 
corporate partners lp a private investment group 
shamrock has filed suit in delaware chancery court in an effort 
to block polaroids buyback the esop and the sale of stock to 
corporate partners polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
polaroid said its stock repurchase offer expires march 20 and is 
subject to various conditions including definitive financing an 
absence of adverse decisions in lawsuits with shamrock and changes 
in shamrocks hostile bid if more than 16 million shares are 
tendered polaroid said it will buy shares back on a pro rata basis

the company began in a trailer in 1985 and saw sales climb to

investor eli jacobs would acquire worlds of wonders assets for an 
undisclosed amount of cash notes and preferred stock and continue 
to operate the company in fremont under the same name jordan said 
it allows the company to move forward with the plans for a 
revitalized business which we developed over the past year 
stephen j hopkins wows chairman and chief executive officer said 
in a statement 
in addition to jacobs the investment group includes franklyn s 
barry jr former president of fisherprice toys and david edelman 
former president of ingram software 
proceeds from the sale would go to worlds of wonders secured 
creditors algemene bank nederland and first national bank of 
chicago lead bank for a group of five financial institutions the 
company said

stockholders would not receive any money and that their stock would 
be canceled the new company would then issue its own stock jordan 
said 
worlds of wonder announced late last year it was talking with 
investors about a possible sale the company has been negotiating 
the agreement with jacobs and the other investors for the past few 
weeks jordan said 
just before it filed for chapter 11 protection worlds of wonder 
which designs develops markets and distributes toys employed 
about 500 people about 120 people now work for the company

labor secretary elizabeth dole said 
tuesday that president bush needs more time to decide whether to 
accept an aflcio request that he intervene to block a threatened 
strike at eastern airlines 
the aflcio meanwhile intensified its preparations for a 
strike asking its affiliated unions to assist the machinists union 
if it goes on strike against eastern and to boycott its parent 
company texas air corp 
the stakes are high and the iam deserves the most thorough 
support we can provide aflcio president lane kirkland said in a 
letter to the unions 
outside eastern headquarters in nearby miami hundreds of eastern 
workers held a noonhour rally as a show of solidarity with 
negotiators on their way to washington dc tuesday night for an 
intensive round of mediated contract talks 
speaking at the rally as if a strike were a certainty eastern 
machinists leader charles bryan promised anyone who gives 
services or aid and comfort to providing staff or help to texas air 
owner frank lorenzo in the strike pending here will suffer the 
wrath of organized labor 
the 9000 eastern mechanics and ground workers are scheduled to 
strike march 4 but that deadline would automatically be pushed back 
60 days if bush named an emergency board to mediate the 16month 
dispute 
mrs dole said bush was awaiting advice from the departments of 
labor and transportation and a recommendation from the national 
mediation board on whether an emergency board was needed the 
mediation board is coordinating talks scheduled to resume wednesday 
give the president the opportunity to look at all the data 
first mrs dole said 
eastern which has asked the machinists for 150 million a year 
in wage and other concessions has said it plans to operate in the 
event of a strike the union says the carrier has circulated memos 
asking supervisors for a list of managers scheduled for work march 
4 training records and parts in stock 
the machinists are seeking raises totaling 50 million which 
means the two sides are 200 million apart 
labor leaders monday promised to disrupt air travel and shipping 
in the event of a strike by picketing eastern its sister carrier 
continental airlines and any air or ground carriers that have 
service agreements with eastern

a 200 million civil lawsuit against fairchild 
industries voishan unit accuses the defense contractor of 
falsifying test results for nuts bolts and rivets used in military 
and commercial planes 
the suit was filed in us district court in los angeles in may 
but it remains sealed while the government considers joining the 
action the los angeles times reported tuesday 
fairchild spokeswoman deborah tucker at the companys chantilly 
va headquarters declined to comment on the suit 
the news of the suit is the latest development in a controversy 
over aircraft parts made by voishan the seattle times reported 
sunday that the company is suspected of supplying substandard parts 
to boeing co that bear the approval stamp of a fictitious 
qualitycontrol inspector 
boeing said its own investigation turned up no problem with the 
voishan parts 
fairchild said last week that there have been no claims from 
customers that it shipped any unsafe fasteners it said it was 
conducting its own investigation into the allegations 
the allegations prompted a criminal investigation which included 
a 48hour search at the plant two weeks ago by federal authorities 
both newspapers reported 
tom runion a former lab technician at the voishan plant in 
suburban chatsworth and two unidentified former employees filed the 
suit under the false claims act which allows plaintiffs to win a 
part of any damages eventually awarded 
the us justice department may join such suits as a plaintiff if 
it decides the allegations have merit 
the suit alleges that voishan falsified the results of safety 
tests on its fasteners including tests to assess the parts 
durability under stress 
the criminal investigation is being pursued jointly by the fbi 
internal revenue service defense department the navy and the air 
force the newspapers said 
according to an affidavit filed by the fbi the federal aviation 
administration has ordered boeing co and mcdonnell douglas corp to 
determine whether they used any fasteners for which tests are 
questionable 
the alleged falsifications took place because necessary testing 
equipment was inoperative the tests could not be accomplished in 
the available time due to backlogs or because parts from a 
particular lot failed a test and it was decided by management to 
approve the parts anyway the affidavit alleged 
the probe led the carlyle group of washington dc to announce 
it is reconsidering its 230 million bid for fairchild the times

take over the camping equipment maker according to a document filed 
tuesday

contained the clearest public statement of the familys intentions 
to date 
some analysts have speculated the 64pershare offer from family 
members was intended to put the company on the auction block others 
said the family appeared to be serious about retaining control and 
may have made the offer as a defensive move to ward off other 
takeover attempts 
the acquisition was undertaken in order to better enable the 
family and the companys management to focus attention on the 
longterm interests of the company the sec filing said 
the family proposed the leveraged buyout to the coleman board on 
feb 14 
selling some of the assets of the acquired company is a 
relatively common method of repaying money borrowed for 
debtfinanced takeovers 
coleman co officials refused to comment on the sec document 
coleman stock continued trading heavily on the new york stock 
exchange closing tuesday at 7062 up 12 cents average daily 
trading normally is 20700 shares on tuesday 108300 shares

other action if its proposal fails 
i think what theyre saying is they dont have a secondary 
plan but they reserve the right to do anything else they darn well 
please said ron wade managing partner at the kansas city mo 
office of the arthur anderson and co accounting and consulting firm

benefit from reductions in the us grain surplus that had long 
dampened commodities prices additionally land values have 
continued to increase and the overall level of famers indebtedness 
has been reduced significantly hanson said
