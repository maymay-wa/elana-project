state employees trying to stump the 
dummy or win loot in the boot were outfoxed when their bosses 
blocked calls to radio station contests after learning the calls 
had caused the governments phone system to crash 
over the past few days state officials thought they had major 
phone problems when the phone system went down for up to 20 minutes 
three or four times a day 
when they checked into the problem they learned the phones 
werent working because so many state workers were clogging phone 
lines by calling klik to play such games as loot in the boot 
in which players guess how much money the country music station is 
giving away 
officials on friday had the phone company restrict state 
employees access to all jefferson city radio station contest 
lines workers using a state phone to call the stations now receive 
a recorded message preventing them from getting through 
office of administration director john pelzer said he did not 
know how many of the 12000 state employees who work in the capital 
area were trying to get through to contest lines 
the phone company said thousands and thousands of people and 
not just state employees were calling i dont know how many 
employees would have to be on the phone at the same time to bring 
it down but this is the first time in the five years weve had 
this system that it has been brought to its knees pelzer said 
one enterprising employee devised a method using the flash 
and redial buttons on her phone to call kliks contest line on 
eight different lines at once pelzer daid 
weve always had a reasonable policy toward personal phone 
calls pelzer said if you need to call home to take care of a 
problem ok if youre sitting around listening to the radio all 
day waiting for the disc jockey to say ill take the seventh 
caller so you can win 1000 that is not reasonable and i dont 
think anybody could argue that it is

why did the 18 ducks cross the busy 
street 
they were trying to get to the other side but they didnt make 
it seventeen fell into a storm sewer 
louie deluca said he was looking out the window of his 
woodworking shop friday when he saw a wood duck hen with 17 
ducklings trailing behind cross the busy street in downtown 
papillion 
i couldnt believe it he said they were certainly in the 
wrong place 
deluca 42 said he and his 12yearold son danny ran outside 
and stood in the middle of the street directing and stopping 
traffic so the ducks could pass 
but the mother duck began to run when she spied deluca 
she ran right over a sewer grate and naturally the little ones 
followed deluca said 
and one by one the baby ducks disappeared through the openings 
in the grate the mother continued to run and eventually flew off 
deluca said 
my son and i got a box and as each baby duck jumped out of 
the sewer grate we caught them and put them in the box 
the nimble brownandyellow ducklings were about the size of 
tennis balls deluca said all but one jumped out of the sewer he 
said 
the last one seemed kind of scared 
so the duck samaritan called the public works department and a 
crew came out with a crane lifted off the grate and pulled the 
last duckling out 
deluca said his son and daughter took the ducklings to the henry 
doorly zoo 
the mother never returned he said

us defense secretary frank carlucci and japanese 
officials have discussed washingtons plans to develop a jet 
fighter known as the fsx a carlucci aide said friday 
he also said carlucci is very pleaced with americanjapanese 
defense cooperation including sharing the costs of maintaining us 
servicemen in japan 
the aide a senior defense department official spoke with the 
condition he not be indentified 
carlucci held two days of talks with senior japanese defense and 
foreign ministry officials and there were no areas of significant 
disagreement according to the official 
carlucci arrived in tokyo thursday to brief japanese authorities 
on the ussoviet summit conference in moscow and discuss 
bilateral issues 
the aide said carlucci and japanese defense officials discussed 
only in general terms the plans to jointly develop the fsx fighter 
however this works out it will be in a positive way he 
said it is a signpost for the future for both of us because an 
essential part of our defense relationship will be the exchange of 
technology a twoway flow 
the japan broadcasting corp a public television network said 
the two sides agreed to set up a technology steering committee 
to oversee the transfer of fsx technology between the japanese 
defense agency and the us air force 
it said the 13 billion needed for developing the jet fighter 
will come from japanese firms with us companies as 
subcontractors and the united states will develop the planes 
engines and japan its radar system 
carluccis aide said both countries are constantly 
addressing the issue of financial support for the more than 
50000 american military personnel stationed in the main japanese 
islands and okinawa 
some us congressmen have said japan should do more because of 
the enormous increase in the value of the yen which has more than 
doubled against the dollar in the last three years 
were not going around with a tin cup because we need help 
with our budget problems the aide said you cant go around 
poormouthing your friends they get tired of it 
when you talk about burdensharing we should talk about 
mutual security and joint cooperation and identify areas of 
weakness 
japan provides more than 45000 worth of support annually for 
each us serviceman stationed here assistant defense secretary 
richard l armitage told congress march 17 it also helps pay some 
expenses of the 21000 japanese working at us bases 
altogether japan will spend 25 billion the most 
generous hostnation support arrangement the us enjoys anywhere 
in the world armitage said

a top pentagon official admits the military 
faces a tough obstacle in the drug war itself 
for starters there are surveillance planes with cracked wings 
supersonic fighters that could fall from the sky while tailing 
slowmoving drug planes and military police whose training does 
not include reading suspects their rights 
nonetheless the joint chiefs of staff are preparing battle 
plans for an escalated antidrug effort by the military marine lt 
gen stephen g olmstead told a house government operations 
subcommittee on friday 
as deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug policy and 
enforcement olmstead is responsible for coordinating the 
militarys antidrug effort which was ordered by congress in 
legislation authorizing defense department spending programs 
olmstead said that use of airborne warning planes is the only 
immediate way to detect smuggler aircraft flying over the 
usmexican border 
thats where the militarys problems begin 
navy e2c surveillance planes one of three types of detection 
aircraft that could be used are in bad trouble with cracked wing 
problems the general said thirtyfour planes in the fleet of 85 
are currently out of service he testified 
the navy has a major rehabilitation problem he added im 
not sure any would be available we have just reduced the force by 
a drastic number the past year 
the coast guard and customs service each have two e2cs on 
antidrug patrols but they face the same wing problems and may be 
grounded 
another solution is the air force awacs a much larger 
surveillance plane 
but olmstead said that the air force has only 33 awacs on active 
missions a third of them overseas of the 22 in the united states 
he said the initial estimate is that five or six would be needed 
each day to cover the usmexican border 
it costs 9400 an hour to operate such a plane olmstead said 
adding that the awacs and the carrierbased e2c are far too 
sophisticated to be operated economically for antidrug missions 
olmstead did acknowledge that the landbased navy p3 
surveillance plane is a good option the plane is used by the coast 
guard and the customs service in antidrug patrols 
committee chairman glenn english dokla then asked if the 
military could provide combat aircraft such as the f14 f15 
f16 f18 and f4 to intercept drug smugglers 
olmstead said using such planes to follow slowmoving drug 
planes would cause them to stall and fall out of the sky 
the general also said that military police are not trained to 
perform civilian arrests theyre not concerned with civil rights 
and miranda reading a defendant his rights when arrested 
and olmstead said to have the military seal the borders 
against air and sea smugglers as some lawmakers are demanding the 
armed forces would have to stop everything else were doing he 
estimated that just to seal the ground border with mexico would 
take between 20000 and 40000 troops 
olmstead was asked by rep bill grant dfla if the navy would 
have to cut back its military mission by increasing drug patrols 
yes i suspect it would the general said

here is the transcript of president reagans 
remarks upon return friday from the moscow summit and the 
introduction by vice president george bush 
bush mr president and mrs reagan im delighted to say on 
behalf of the people of the united states of america welcome home 
and well done 
everyone in america watched your historic trip and hoped for the 
best and pulled for you and now its over and we can all say that 
youve made a historic contribution to peace in the world 
on arms control british prime minister mrs margaret 
thatcher probably put it best when she said that you have 
bravely gone forward in spite of the voices of denial and doubt 
you showed the only way to succeed is by retaining your resolve and 
speaking with conviction 
as for the latter i suspect you know mr president that you 
caught a little flack for bringing up the issue of human rights so 
forcefully right there in the heart of the soviet system but most 
americans most americans felt as i did we have a tradition of 
freedom and a history of free speech and whats wrong with telling 
the other guy how you feel 
the fact is you made us proud this week an american president 
strode the hard ground of red square and reminded the world 
through the sureness of his step and the lilt of his words what a 
bracing thing freedom is what a moving and bracing thing 
so welcome back mr president its good to see you god bless 
you and nancy 
reagan thank you thank you well thank you all very much as 
some of you may have heard soviet leader mr mikhail s 
gorbachev and i have been trading russian proverbs this week but 
you know flying back across the atlantic today it was an american 
saying that kept running through my mind believe me as far as 
nancy and i are concerned theres no place like home 
we want to thank all of you for coming out today were grateful 
for your enthusiasm and for the warmth of your welcome and take it 
from me all this red white and blue scenery hits these two weary 
travelers right where we live if i might paraphrase george m 
cohan some may call it flag waving but right now i cant think of 
a better flag to wave 
were a little tired but were exhilarated at what has 
happened exhilarated too at the thought of the future and what 
may lie ahead for the young people of america and all of the world 
the events of this week in moscow were momentous not 
conclusive perhaps but momentous and believe me right now 
momentous will do just fine 
you know its occurred to me that time does have a way of 
sorting things out for many years now americans have seen the 
danger of war and pleaded the cause of peace and other americans 
have seen the danger of totalitarianism and pleaded the cause of 
freedom so i was just thinking why dont we just agree today on 
something that maybe we should have been saying to each other all 
along that were all americans and that we all have one and the 
same burning cause in our hearts the cause of world peace and the 
cause of world freedom 
peace and freedom are what this trip was about and we saw some 
real progress in several areas in moscow on human rights on 
regional conflicts on greater contacts between the people of the 
soviet union and the united states we exchanged the documents that 
put into force an historic treaty that eliminates for the first 
time an entire class of us and soviet nuclear weapons and 
establishes real breakthroughs in verification procedures and we 
made tangible progress toward an even more historic treaty on 
strategic weapons yes a 50 percent reduction in nuclear weapons

all of this was good and promising for the future 
but theres something else i want to tell you about i wish you 
could have seen the faces we saw in the soviet union as i said to 
the young people at moscow state university it was hard really to 
tell them apart from any other group of students in our country or 
anywhere else in the world and as i told mr gorbachev there were 
also the faces young and old we saw on the streets of moscow at 
first more than anything else they were curious faces but as 
time went on the smiles began and then the waves and i dont 
have to tell you nancy and i smiled back and waved just as hard 
the truth came home to us once again it isnt people but 
governments that make war and it isnt people but governments 
that erect barriers that keep us apart much is happening in the 
soviet union we hope and pray that the signs of change continue 
there our pledge mr gorbachev and i is to work to continue 
building a better understanding between our two countries 
but lets remember too that just as our forward strategy of 
peace and freedom anticipated positive changes it remains ready to 
take us over any bumps in the road and thats because our strategy 
is based on faith in the eventual triumph of human freedom that 
faith in human that abiding belief in what the unfettered human 
spirit can accomplish defines us as a people and a nation 
and you know ive been told that even a few veteran journalists 
said a chill went through them this week at a sight they never 
thought they would see in their lifetime an american president 
there in the heart of moscow talking about economic political and 
individual freedoms to the future leaders of the soviet union 
explaining that freedom makes a difference and explaining how 
freedom works talking too about the possibility of a new age of 
prosperity and peace where old antagonisms between nations can 
someday be put behind us a new age that could be ours if only 
well reach out to it 
ladies and gentlemen all across our country during these weeks 
of spring its graduation time and i hope our young graduates 
know what a sudden startling future may now be before them a 
future brought about by a technological and information revolution 
based on a growing understanding of the nexus between economic 
growth and creative freedom but i hope too that young americans 
and all americans will always remember that this revolution is 
only the continuation of a revolution begun two centuries ago a 
revolution of hope a hope that someday a new land might become a 
place where freedoms light would beacon forth 
that faith in freedom that belief in the unalienable rights of 
man begun in carpenters hall in philadelphia traveled last week 
to the lenin hills in moscow it was the selflessness of so many 
americans that brought it there selflessness by americans for over 
two centuries but especially by those americans who fought what 
has truly been called the twilight struggle of the postwar years 
it was a struggle where national interest was not always clearly 
defined or adversaries easily identified or sacrifice fully 
appreciated 
now more than ever we must continue the judgment of future 
generations will be harsh upon us if after so much sacrifice and 
now at the hour of hope we falter or fail let us resolve to 
continue one nation one people united in our love of peace and 
freedom determined to keep our defenses strong to stand with 
those who struggle for freedom across the world to keep america a 
shining city a light unto the nations 
and let us remember too that theres work remaining here at 
home that whatever the accomplishments of america we must never be 
prideful toward others we have much to learn from peoples of 
foreign lands and other cultures nor should we ever grow content 
let us never rest until every american of every race or 
background knows the full blessing of liberty until justice for 
all is truly justice for all 
and most of all let us remember that being an american means 
remembering another loyalty a loyalty as the hymn puts it to 
another country i have heard of a place whose king is never seen 
and whose armies cannot be counted 
and yet if patriotism is not the only thing it is one of the 
best things and we can be grateful to god that we have seen such a 
rebirth of it here in this country 
and you know its true frequently when such moments happen in a 
nations history theres a popular saying or song that speaks for 
that time and just maybe this verse sounds familiar to you if 
tomorrow all the things were gone id worked for all my life and i 
had to start again with just my children and my wife id thank my 
lucky stars to be living here today cause the flag still stands 
for freedom and they cant take that away 
nancy and i have full hearts today were grateful to all of you 
and to the american people grateful for the chance to serve 
grateful for all of the support and warmth that youve given us 
over the years 
and do you know what else we think our friend lee greenwood has 
it just right all our days and especially today there aint no 
doubt we love this land god bless the usa

signed a pentagon contract to launch an unspecified cargo next year 
with a new rocket strapped under the wing of a bomber until 
released and fired 
orbital sciences corp said friday the first launch of its 
pegasus rocket is scheduled for mid1989 the customer is the 
defense advanced research projects agency 
david w thompson president and chief executive officer said 
the firm expects to launch satellites of up to 600 pounds for less 
than 10 million each a fraction of the cost of vehicles launched 
conventionally from the ground 
oscs partner in the venture is hercules aerospace co an 
oldline rocket maker that had a part in the polaris trident 
pershing peacekeeper mx poseidon and minuteman missiles 
thompson said no government money was spent to develop the new 
rocket he said the company expects to build sell and launch a 
payload a month with the rocket 
the company will launch the pegasus from a 36yearold air force 
b52 bomber the same one that carried the x15 on its first 
flight in 1962 the rocket will be strapped under the ships right 
wing and released over the ocean at 40000 feet 
it has twice the payload capability of a comparable 
groundlaunched vehicle thompson said 
the winged threestage solidfuel pegasus is 50 feet long and 
50 inches in diameter about the size of the x15 the first 
aircraft to reach the fringes of space

the sponsor of a bill that would require 
railroads to randomly test their employees for drug and alcohol 
abuse says he believes the measure protects workers against 
erroneous readings and harassment 
but rep thomas a luken dohio who introduced the legislation 
friday said at a news conference that even if railroad unions 
decide not to support the bill well continue to forge ahead 
congress has been focusing on drug and alcohol abuse by 
transportation workers ever since the jan 4 1987 collision 
between an amtrak passenger train and linked conrail locomotives in 
chase md sixteen people were killed and 175 hurt in the accident 
in which conrail crewmen have admitted they were smoking marijuana 
shortly before the wreck 
but bills that would require random drug testing have been 
bogged down with labor and other opponents arguing that such 
procedures violate the right of privacy and leave employees 
vulnerable to harassment and incorrect test results that could 
threaten their careers 
luken chairman of the house energy and commerce transportation 
subcommittee has been among those arguing that laboratory tests 
are so unreliable that large numbers of workers should not be 
subjected to tests 
he pointed friday however to evidence of accidents caused by 
drug and alcohol abuse and said we do have a great demand for 
this kind of thing 
on april 25 dr roger horn of hunt valley md whose daughter 
ceres 16 was killed in the chase accident visited television and 
radio stations and newspapers in lukens cincinnati district and 
argued that a random testing bill was needed horn is a member of 
safe travel america a group of relatives and friends of the 
crashs victims who have lobbied for such legislation on capitol 
hill 
many railroad union officials have also dropped their outright 
opposition to random testing and now say they are willing to try to 
help craft lukens legislation 
lawrence l mann attorney for the railway labor executives 
association which represents rail unions said labor officials 
like the protections luken put in his bill but are still concerned 
that the testing would be an invasion of privacy 
were not going to push this bill he said after lukens 
news conference were going to try to improve it 
the legislation would give the department of transportation 90 
days to set up procedures for administering the tests 
workers testing positive would be suspended and required to 
undergo rehabilitation programs they would be given their jobs 
back after successfully completing the treatment 
the bill establishes a series of requirements designed to 
protect workers against inaccurate test results and to protect them 
from harassment it also sets penalties for falsifying results and 
avoiding testing by leaving accident scenes 
this strikes a fair balance between protecting the public from 
the lethal threat of drug use by railroad personnel and affording 
the drug abuser human treatment that allows him a real opportunity 
to put his life in order again said the subcommittees ranking 
republican rep bob whittaker of kansas who appeared with luken 
the measure would also require testing after accidents before 
hiring for reasonable cause and as part of annual physical 
examinations 
on may 5 the federal railroad administration proposed rules 
that would require railroads to randomly test many of their 
employees for drugs but not alcohol the government already 
requires drug and alcohol testing for employees involved in 
accidents but the constitutionality of those rules has been 
challenged in federal court

an fbi report says guidelines the bureau used 
to conduct a twoyear investigation of a group opposed to 
administration policies in central america were too vague and 
should be tightened say government sources familiar with the 
report 
an fbi spokesman however said it would be premature to say 
whether the bureau planned to change procedures as a result of the 
inquiry into how it investigated the committee in solidarity with 
the people of el salvador 
the investigation came to light after a new york lawyers group 
obtained documents in february showing that fbi agents photographed 
protesters at peace rallies recorded license plate numbers and 
investigated nuns union members and college students 
the internal fbi review was launched in february amid 
allegations by cispes that the investigation had been politically 
motivated and had violated civil liberties 
the investigation conducted from 1983 to 1985 and involving 
nearly all the fbis field offices was conducted under the 
bureaus antiterrorism guidelines 
the tenor of one of the recommendations in the fbi report was 
that the guidelines need to be made more specific to keep us out 
of trouble one source said friday 
fbi spokesman milt ahlerich said fbi director william sessions 
and his senior staff are reviewing the report will promptly 
provide detailed information to congressional oversight committees 
and that it is premature to say whether the bureau will change 
any procedures 
the report is highly critical of how the fbi handled informer 
frank varelli whose information supplied much of the basis for the 
bureaus investigation of cispes 
the internal report said there was a lack of proper supervision 
of varelli and that he received certain information from fbi files 
that he should not have gotten according to the sources 
the investigation of cispes began march 30 1983 prompted by 
tips that key members were involved in covertly furnishing funds 
and material to the fmln a leftist group seeking to seize power in 
el salvador 
it was closed in june 1985 when the justice department concluded 
the group was involved in political activities protected by the 
first amendment and not in international terrorism 
varelli a former evangelist from el salvador became a paid 
informer for the fbis dallas office in 1981 the same year the 
bureau began a probe of cispes for possible violation of the 
foreign agents registration act 
that probe was closed after 18 months but the fbi opened the 
1983 probe under much broader authority granted by justice 
department guidelines governing inquiries into international 
terrorism 
many provisions of those guidelines are secret but in general 
terms they allow inquiries into groups and individuals who could 
possibly represent a terrorist threat to the united states or aid 
and abet others who would undertake violent terrorist activities

an anesthesiologist says he is quitting his 
practice to run a selfservice laundry and drycleaning business 
because the wash carries a lot less liability than medicine 
when doctors have a malpractice suit its a 3 million to 5 
million loss if someones laundry doesnt come out right i just 
pay them the 40 or so to cover it and its done said dr joseph 
j merigo 
merigo 57 took over the hudson coinop on march 1 he said 
insurance rates drove him out of his 20year practice as an 
anesthesiologist at bostonarea hospitals 
a lot of people think you make a lot of money as a doctor 
merigo said but you dont have any choice your bills are so 
high 
merigo said his liability insurance premiums just about equal 
his annual income although he has never been sued 
merigo still works three mornings a week at bournewood hospital 
a psychiatric facility in brookline whose electroconvulsive 
therapy center he helped found he will stop practicing medicine 
oct 23 when his insurance policy runs out 
he admitted to some hesitation about the career switch you 
dont get the same kick from doing a suit that you do after doing a 
good job in a lifethreatening situation merigo said 
and he has found that old habits die hard he recently tended to 
a customer who turned gray while dragging a bag of clothes into the 
store 
i asked her if she had problems with her heart and if she was 
taking medicine she said she was i made her sit down and catch 
her breath merigo said 
that woman was in congestive heart failure right here in that 
chair he said pointing to a seat near the cash register 
but the laundry business has its rewards he said i figure if 
i can buy another one of these ill be making about what i was 
making as a doctor

window roberts believes either the vandal stole the snake or the 
reptile escaped through the window 
roberts posted a 100 reward no questions asked for 
leonards safe return and the gadsden times ran a frontpage story 
on the snakes disappearance 
the snake mysteriously reappeared thursday afternoon at the door 
to roberts office perhaps because he was hungry and missed his 
old job roberts said

leonard goodings remodeling project 
turned into a major restoration effort when he removed some siding 
and discovered his old house was actually a log cabin 
i was going to tear the siding off it and rent it out 
gooding said friday in a telephone interview i eliminated all 
the siding and came up with a log cabin its in perfect shape 
the 50footlong 30footlong building is constructed of round 
handhewn white oak logs it has no plumbing but is wired for 
electricity 
gooding bought the house from his nephew milton gooding who 
owned it for 10 years and lived in a newer concreteblock addition 
to the rear of the house the part built of logs was used as a 
daycare center 
before milton gooding bought it the structure was used as a 
church for dozens of years leonard gooding said 
we know it goes back at least until 1939 but i think that 
date applies only to the new part not the logs he said 
gooding is considering what to do instead of adding the building 
to his list of rental properties 
im already getting some interest and some offers on it he 
said i think it would make a nice antique store or lake home or 
even a restaurant i may sell it to someone who wants to move it

a severe drought in northern mexico is 
killing cattle by the thousands turning cropland into brittle 
cakes of scorched soil and threatening to destroy farm workers 
livelihood 
were looking at a very ugly situation said teofilo 
anchondo a farmer and cattle producer on a communal farm just 
outside this chihuahua state capital 
our animals are very skinny and a lot have died said 
anchondo who has lost eight of his 50 cows to the drought in 
recent weeks 
the semiarid north averages only 10 to 12 inches of rainfall a 
year and estimates on the current season average about half that 
although some ranchers say the situation is even worse 
miniscule rainfall last fall in the northcentral and 
northwestern states and lack of rain and snow in the sierra madre 
occidental during the winter has left thousands of acres of 
pastureland barren nonirrigated fields blistered dams and wells 
low 
the rich agricultural and grazing lands of northwestern sonora 
and sinaloa states are also drying up due to the almost yearlong 
drought there 
and sonora gov rodolfo felix valdez announced this week the 
suspension of the fall planting season due to lack of water in 
the ruiz cortines reservoir and an emergency employment plan to 
put farm laborers to work repairing roads and canals and clearing 
land 
northwestern mexico is weathering one of its worst droughts in 
20 years said hector cordova agriculture department spokesman 
in mexico city 
the drought also has hit some parts of central and southern 
mexico 
barren pastures in the sprawling states of sonora chihuahua and 
coahuila on the us border are forcing beef producers to buy 
thousands of tons of alfalfa and other feed to sustain cattle that 
usually would be put out to graze 
milk producers who buy feed even in normal years are finding the 
cost skyrocketing each week as competition for the scarce alfalfa 
heats up 
may usually a good month for rain in eastern chihuahua and 
western coahuila didnt bring a drop this year 
it hasnt rained since october im very worried said 
anchondo 
in chihuahua and coahuila states farmers who work nonirrigated 
land are foregoing the current cornplanting season in the hope 
that june brings rain and favorable beanplanting conditions 
in nuevo leon on the northeastern border with the united states 
cattle are dying in unsuccessful attempts to jump ditches in search 
of water and fields are dried out 
residents report drinking water supplies are precariously low in 
some poorer areas but the drought has not reached a critical stage 
in homes 
several thousand cows have across the north died because grass 
remaining in the pastures lacks vitamins and proteins the cattle 
are walking too far for water or theyre eating toxic herbs 
ranchers said 
scores of calves are born dead or die shortly after birth 
because their mothers are in such poor shape the ranchers said 
were getting cattle that cant even stand up said alonso 
baeza general manager of a chihuahua meatpacking plant 
baeza said the plant slaughters 150 to 200 head a day under 
normal circumstances 
now 80 head is a good day and only about half of them are in 
good shape he said 
the small farmer is suffering the most because he doesnt have 
the resources to buy feed baeza said 
although sonora alone has lost more than 2000 insured head of 
cattle total cattle losses throughout the north cannot be 
calculated because most ranchers dont take out insurance and 
therefore do not report deaths 
likewise its impossible to estimate the degree of the economic 
disaster now looming in the north especially for the small farmer 
who lives a handtomouth existance even in the best of times 
theres no bank but our own pocketbooks and were using up all 
our savings said alejandro villalobos 35 a chihuahua farmer 
and cattle rancher 
said villalobos you go along and when its time to sell 
cattle you owe almost as much as you get

european complaints about the decision to 
increase us wheat production have been disappointing and at 
variance with the facts says agriculture secretary richard e lyng 
i was terribly disappointed in your response to our decision 
to lower the set aside requirements for wheat producers lyng 
said friday in a letter to european community agriculture 
commissioner frans andriessen 
he took issue with a statement by ec officials in brussels on 
wednesday that the us decision to reduce the acreage idling 
requirement for wheat growers from 275 percent of planted acreage 
to 10 percent would result in an additional 10 million to 12 
million tons of grain on the world market 
the prospects are really quite different he said 
lyng expressed hope that in the future we can respond to each 
others policy announcements with a greater regard for the facts of 
the case 
he also complained in the letter that european wheat production 
continues at high levels despite repeated assurances that 
production will be lowered 
in a strongly worded statement the european commissioners 
declared that the united states was violating international trade 
agreements by increasing farm subsidies to american wheat producers 
farmers are required to idle the acreage specified by the 
agriculture department if they are to be eligible for government 
programs that include price support loans and income support 
payments 
us wheat supplies available for export will be smaller 
than previously even with less acreage idled lyng said he 
attributed this to lower stocks of wheat at the outset of the 
marketing year 
smaller carryin stocks will mean us wheat supplies will 
total about 90 million metric tons nearly 3 million tons less than 
a year earlier he said an attached chart showed overall 
supplies at 1094 million for 198687 1073 million for 198788 
93 million for 198889 and 904 million for 198990 
he also said that because of participation by farmers in two 
other acreage idling programs the us will continue to idle a 
large amount of wheat land in 1989 about the equivalent to the 
harvested wheat area of france spain and portugal 
lyng said the us share of the world wheat trade was likely to 
decrease even with the increased acreage to 40 percent or less 
compared with 42 percent last year and more than 45 percent in the 
1970s 
he said higher prices for wheat in the united states combined 
with a 64 percent reduction in target prices will lower the 
amount of subsidies paid to wheat farmers and increase their degree 
of market orientation 
target prices are set by congress and adjusted by the 
agriculture department to help determine the size of income support 
payments made under some of the farm programs

bigger supplies of some kinds of livestock and 
poultry are leading to lower prices and driving down the return to 
farmers on the food they produce agriculture department economists 
say 
but moderate food price inflation overall is expected this year 
according to an economic analysis from usda 
the gap between consumer spending on food and the amount of 
money farmers actually get out of it most likely will rise 66 
percent this year to a total of 302 billion according to the 
analysis 
spending for domestically produced food is expected to rise 4eside 
livestock and poultry supplies are 
causing the change a 50cent cut in the milk support price is 
expected to result in somewhat lower return to the dairy farmer 
despite a slight increase in consumption 
fruit and vegetable prices are actually expected to be lower 
amid expanded supplies of lettuce potatoes apples pears and 
strawberries 
but stronger export demand for grains and oil crops as well as 
reduced supplies of them should drive up prices somewhat and at 
least partially offset a portion of the decline in farm value 
consumer food spending is expected to increase at about the same 
rate as last year increased supplies of pork poultry and some 
other major commodities are expected to lower retail prices but 
the analysis foresees moderate food price inflation overall

salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte 
began his fourth day in a washington hospital today where doctors 
are trying to decide how best to treat his liver and stomach cancer 
walter reed medical army medical center issued a statement 
friday saying doctors at the hospital and duartes personal 
physician would look at test results and present treatment 
alternatives to the president and his family 
the hospital did not specify when a decision would be made it 
said duarte was in guarded but stable condition 
both the hospital and duartes personal physician benjamin 
interiano who is from el salvador have been reluctant to discuss 
chances of duartes recovery but a state department official 
insisting on anonymity told the associated press on friday that 
duarte is suffering from terminal cancer 
the only question is how long he will live its probably 
measured in months the official said 
the official added there have been informal discussions in el 
salvador about the possibility of duarte resigning his office the 
next in line in the order of succession is vice president rodolfo 
castillo claramount who is serving as acting president in duartes 
absence 
duarte received a getwell visit from vice president george bush 
bush met with duarte for 30 minutes in the salvadoran 
presidents room at walter reed during the visit bush wished 
duarte well and expressed his gratitude for what hes done for 
democracy kristin taylor a spokeswoman for the vice president 
said 
duarte 62 has been undergoing tests since his arrival at 
walter reed on tuesday night he visited a special clinic thursday 
for magnetic resonance imaging tests to determine the extent of his 
cancer 
duarte who was born nov 23 1925 in san salvador received a 
civil engineering degree in 1948 from the university of notre dame 
in south bend ind 
in 1960 he cofounded the christian democratic party in el 
salvador and four years later was elected to the first of three 
terms as mayor of san salvador 
he was expelled from the country by the military in 1972 while 
running for president he returned from exile in 1979 following a 
coup by reformistminded military officers the next year he was 
named a member of a militarycivilian junta he became president of 
a new junta in december 1980 
he won a fiveyear term in a presidential election in 1984 and 
was hailed as a leader who could extricate his country from decades 
of poverty and conflict 
but an eightyearold civil war with leftist forces continues 
unabated and the central american nations economy is in a 
shambles duartes party suffered a major defeat in municipal and 
legislative elections in march 
the salvadoran constitution prohibits duarte from running for 
election again next march and the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance appears to be in good position to win the presidency

carrying m16 rifles were caught near the town of teotecacinte in 
northern nuevo segovia province more than a mile inside nicaragua 
the statement identified the two as gilberto moncada miranda and 
gustavo adolfo caliz gamero of honduras 6th infantry battalion 
based in aguas calientes honduras 
it said the soldiers were found doing intelligence work in our 
territory and called the incident an open violation of national 
security 
there was no immediate comment from the honduran government 
the incident followed an exchange of accusations between 
nicaragua and honduras earlier in the week over fighting between 
sandinista troops and ussupported nicaraguan rebels based in 
honduras 
on wednesday the sandinista government denied honduran claims 
that its soldiers crossed into honduras to attack a border post

were killed in the fighting and honduran foreign minister carlos 
lopez protested the incident

jesse jackson left the hectic pace of 
delegaterich california for a day to woo voters in lesspopulous 
montana and new mexico where he said the peoples concerns count 
more than their political importance 
jackson was heading back to california friday night to spend 
today in the rural town of mcfarland which has a mysteriously high 
cancer rate he called on supporters to join him in mcfarland to 
call for government action in finding and correcting the cause of 
the cancer 
montana and new mexico will hold primary elections tuesday the 
last day of the primary season but they have been overshadowed by 
the expensive contest in california whose 314 delegates are the 
richest prize of all the primaries and new jersey which has 109 
delegates 
by contrast new mexico has 24 and montana 19 
but jackson speaking against a backdrop of whitecapped 
mountains a deep blue montana sky and expansive green plain told 
an airport rally in bozeman 
we cannot measure human beings and their needs just by their 
political capital its their humanity thats at stake 
later jackson spoke at a dinner sponsored by the state 
democratic party in butte where he was warmly received by the few 
hundred in attendance most of whom wore michael dukakis buttons 
jackson told the gathering that in democrats across the nation 
there is a rising spirit in the air that we can win 
he offered a prayer for dukakis wife kitty who underwent 
spinal surgery on friday 
noting that the massachusetts governor was home by his wifes 
side jackson joked he has done such a good job in 
massachusetts im trying to keep him there four more years 
also speaking at the dinner was john dukakis the son of the 
frontrunner 
at the bozeman airport jackson talked about the states indian 
population and the need to respect their culture and religion 
about loss of family farms and ranches and the need to fight 
environmental pollution 
the crowd of more than 300 was smaller than what jackson is used 
to but some of his california audiences in the waning days of the 
campaign also have lacked the size of his earlier rallies 
earlier he spoke to more than 1500 people in the trendy 
central plaza of santa fe nm 
there he said that environmental concerns are no longer a 
fringe issue but are central to human existence 
he spoke on the sunbaked plaza surrounded by the citys 
trademark indian sidewalk vendors who sell an array of turquoise 
and silver jewelry 
jackson spoke of the controversy about federal plans to store 
nuclear waste near carlsbad and said safety before waste that 
must be your watchword 
jackson said he did not know the context of reported comments by 
his campaign manager gerald austin that the strongest democratic 
ticket would be dukakis and sen john glenn of ohio 
but he told reporters dont take that seriously 
austin was quoted in the boston herald as saying jackson was his 
first choice for vice president with dukakis but that glenn would 
make for an almost unbeatable ticket 
jackson dismissed the report repeating his earlier assertions 
that if dukakis wins jackson deserves consideration for vice 
president and vice versa 
jackson has taken up the mcfarland issue as a central cause of 
his campaign in its closing days he mentioned it in all his los 
angeles speeches over the past two days

lawmakers reacted to navy forecasts of reduced 
workforces at eight public shipyards with letters planned 
legislation and a resolve to keep employment at current levels 
rep norman dicks dwash said friday that the navys public 
yards face a tough fight in the coming years 
i can see a day where one or two of the public yards might not 
exist because of the downturn of overhaul work he said its 
an ongoing struggle 
a naval sea systems command planning document obtained wednesday 
by the associated press projects a reduction from 71100 to 56400 
jobs at the public yards by the end of 1991 
the document contains job estimates based on anticipated ship 
overhaul and modernization schedules 
the systems command which oversees the navys eight yards said 
wednesday that exact naval shipyard employment figures will not 
be determined until the budget process is completed for fiscal year 
1989 and beyond 
the planning document was born out of a fleet scheduling 
conference in may during which the navy and its shipyard commanders 
took a longrange view of the overhaul workload 
the navy still can adjust its assignments to reflect overhaul 
budgets set by congress for individual years in addition congress 
occasionally forces the navys hand by mandating that a certain 
ship or class of ships be assigned to a specific yard for repairs 
congress has not yet completed work on the federal budget for 
fiscal year 1989 which begins oct 1 even after the spending bill 
is passed however the navy is given discretion to juggle 
workforce sizes in effect the process of assigning overhaul work 
and fixing employment levels never ends so long as the navy 
remains within its budget 
the employment forecasts and planned overhaul assignment 
schedules alarmed sen john heinz rpa who said he would take 
steps to prevent or minimize job losses at the philadelphia naval 
shipyard which now employs about 8700 
heinz said the philadelphia area congressional delegation will 
introduce legislation to require that the philadelphia yard have 
the opportunity to compete for electronics and computer work on 
ships 
meanwhile sen arlen specter rpa wrote to navy secretary 
william l ball iii and to fellow appropriations committee members 
warning that a plan ruling out the electronics upgrades at 
philadelphia until 1991 would cause the yard to lose skilled 
workers who represent a valuable navy investment 
the philadelphia yards workforce could be as low as 6800 at 
the end of the 1991 fiscal year according to projections in the 
working document 
dicks whose district contains the puget sound yard termed the 
planning document a barebones projection and said he did not 
believe employment would drop as low as predicted because past 
forecasts of employment have normally been lower than the job 
levels actually recorded 
dicks said employment at the yards already down 9 percent since 
january 1985 should not drop further for reasons of national 
security 
i think they should stay where they are now and im going to 
do everything i can to fight the decline dicks said 
he said puget sound and other public yards have been quite 
competitive so far in their battle to keep from losing too much 
ground to private yards 
private yards which already handle all new navy ship 
construction have been competing for a larger share of overhauls 
a general accounting office report in march found that 
overall private shipyards are being awarded an increasing share 
of the funds for all overhaul and repair work

most of his prepschool classmates 
expect to be doctors lawyers or businessmen one day but 
17yearold malietau malietoa has bigger plans ruler of western 
samoa 
malietoa who graduated friday is a prince of western samoa and 
heir apparent to the tiny pacific island nations throne 
often i sit up late at night and think about this said 
malietoa who is known as tau among his classmates 
the student who would be king or tupu as it is known in the 
samoan language spent the past year at the episcopal allmale 
school to learn western ways to help him lead his country now 
ruled by his 73yearold grandfather 
an uncle who is an adviser to his grandfather suggested the 
school in northwest connecticut and malietoa agreed because he 
wanted to live in a cold climate for a change 
he has tried skiing and played on the school basketball team 
although he confesses he did not totally understand the game 
i think i was a wing or a guard he said recently yes i 
think i was a guard 
his grandfather is the latest head of state in a dynasty that 
goes back 1500 years malietoas father died in 1984 his son says 
that made him the heir apparent 
however nusi mavala chief administrator of the samoan mission 
at the united nations said the matai a group of titled heads of 
leading families would vote on a new head of state if anything 
happened to malietoas grandfather and there could be other 
claimants he said malietoa could be the leading claimant 
malietoa has been a good student and has fit in well with other 
students but hes more serious than most said the rev peter 
w sipple head of salisbury 
malietoa has no immediate plans for college but is looking into 
the possibility of enrolling at harvard university as a special 
tutorial student in studies that would be useful in governing a 
nation 
there are two countries in the samoan chain of 16 volcanic 
islands in the south pacific 
six of the islands make up american samoa which has been under 
us control since 1900 the others make up western samoa a 
country of 1130 square miles about onefifth the size of 
connecticut with a population of 165000 
malietoa describes western samoa as a benevolent but absolute 
monarchy its economy is tied to bananas copra and taro roots as 
it has been for centuries it has its own currency but only for 
internal use 
we are poor but we do not have hunger he said

negotiators for movie and television 
producers and scriptwriters agreed to continue contract talks this 
weekend in an attempt to resolve a 13week strike by the writers 
guild of america 
both sides met friday at the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers offices in sherman oaks but refused to say 
what progress was made 
people were very frank and candid i think there is certainly 
a new commitment to try on both sides brian walton executive 
director of the guild told reporters after the meeting he refused 
to give details 
both sides said talks would continue over the weekend 
earlier friday striking scriptwriters sought to enlist owners 
of abctv affiliate stations nationwide in their labor dispute 
claiming the strike has caused television audiences to dwindle 
the guild sent letters to owners and managers of 198 abc 
affiliates urging them to press abc to give ground in negotiations 
to prevent further delays in the start of the fall tv season 
the union will send similar letters to cbs and nbc affiliates 
said cheryl rhoden spokeswoman for the guild the abc letters went 
out first because the networks annual meeting for affiliates will 
begin monday in los angeles she said 
the writers walked out march 7 in a dispute that centers on 
residuals the payments they receive for reruns of onehour 
television shows demand for onehour shows in rerun or 
syndication is declining and the producers had sought to index 
residual payments to a shows rerun success 
lack of material has forced the networks to delay the fall 
premieres of a number of series and the writers in their letter 
to abc affiliates suggested quality had suffered as well 
this strike is not only hurting writers its hurting you 
the union letter said 
tvs viewing audience declined 3 percent in the may rating 
period the letter said and its only going to get worse 
the absence of writers has forced studios to order tv movies 
without needed rewrites and the delayed fall shows will be rushed 
into production the letter said 
in addition to residuals other issues in the strike are 
writers demands for more say over changes made in scripts during 
filming and greater credit for their work both on and off screen 
the guild has signed independent contracts with about 80 
independent producers but the producers alliance maintains that 
none of its large members have signed and that the producers who 
did defect employ only a tiny fraction of the 3000 active writers

one man served american presidents from 
franklin roosevelt to john kennedy the other served soviet leaders 
in the central committee of the communist party now theyve 
written a book together to show the faults and virtues of the 
soviet union and the united states 
we wanted to discuss the failures of the two systems 
explained john kenneth galbraith a former ambassador to india and 
at 79 one of this countrys best known economists 
stanislav menshikov 61 is the son of a former soviet 
ambassador in washington he agrees with galbraith that the worst 
problem the two systems have in common is bureaucracy galbraith is 
concerned about bureaucracies in corporations menshikov about the 
soviet government 
our bureaucracy is more dangerous more stifling because its 
running not only the government but industry menshikov says 
he now edits world marxist review in prague czechoslovakia 
it is an official communist organ published in 42 languages 
they came together friday night in a giltandcream colored 
salon of the soviet embassy they have met many times since they 
first were introduced 24 years ago in a similar setting spaso 
house residence of the us ambassador in moscow 
this time they were publicizing their book capitalism 
communism and coexistence from a bitter past to a better 
prospect 
the two spoke in brief interviews between greeting guests 
giving autographs and posing for pictures 
galbraith cited what he sees as parallels between soviet and 
american problems the shortage of labor in low prestige 
industries what he called the hardening of the arteries in big 
industrial organizations 
some soviet steel complexes are a lot like pittsburgh he 
said 
menshikov compared the changes mikhail s gorbachev is trying to 
make in the soviet union with those made in this country under 
franklin roosevelt both sets of reforms were designed to change 
their systems in order to preserve them he said 
in roosevelts case what was the alternative he asked a 
rightwing dictatorship fascism or maybe communism 
he did not suggest what the alternatives to gorbachevs reforms 
would be 
there are two kinds of coexistence menshikov explained 
one is based on fear on nuclear weapons its unstable and 
it can take you to the brink in no time two ships that collide in 
the black sea two ladies who disagree and influence their 
husbands he said 
then he added thats just a joke of course about the 
ladies 
he suggested that in another kind of coexistence different 
systems could live side by side just as different religions live 
side by side in many countries 
you remember there was a time when just to belong to a 
different religion meant you were a hateful enemy he said 
the two men want to believe that kind of relationship will no 
longer exist between people in the soviet union and the united 
states 
our deeper purpose was to show that an american and a russian 
of different views could engage in civil and we hoped informative 
discussions of our different and common problems galbraith 
writes in the introduction to the american edition 
menshikov has written an introduction to the russian edition to 
appear soon in moscow

the military is buying more parts than it 
needs because of problems identifying the items in its inventory 
catalog a congressional study says 
the us general accounting office report released friday said 
the federal catalog system does not meet the congressional mandate 
that every cataloged item be identified in a way that distinguishes 
it from other parts 
the gao said it is conceivable that millions of dollars are 
being needlessly spent to buy catalog store and issue duplicates 
of items 
the extent of duplication and other logistics problems caused 
by inadequate item identification or the unnecessary costs 
incurred as a result are largely unknown the gao concluded 
however these problems may be serious and costly 
the federal catalog system was established in 1952 to provide a 
uniform cataloging system among the military services by 
identifying and differentiating supply items cataloging enables 
the government to know what it has in stock so it does not buy 
items already in its inventory 
the gao said that as of the end of 1986 30 percent of all 
cataloged items did not have approved names and 29 percent were 
described just well enough to meet minimum requirements 
thousands of items were misclassified or assigned duplicate 
numbers in the federal catalog the gao added 
defense department officials said the use of approved item names 
has received greater emphasis in the past two years 
the need to improve item identifications and reduce duplicate 
items in the federal catalog system are central to many of the 
ongoing efforts in the cataloging community jack katzen deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for systems said in a letter to the 
gao 
the gao said the defense logistics agency has recently taken 
several steps to improve item identification but that for the most 
part it is too early to gauge their effectiveness

six miners buried 330 feet 
underground for more than two days after an explosion in a coal 
shaft were found alive early saturday 
hesse state radio said rescuers discovered the survivors in an 
air pocket they were exhausted but otherwise appeared not be 
seriously injured the report said 
a spokesman for preussen elektra the company which owns the 
mine also said the six did not suffer serious injuries and were 
reunited with their families 
the six men were among 57 miners in the shaft when the explosion 
occurred wednesday the radio said rescuers were now hoping to find 
more survivors 
on thursday mine officials had given up hope of finding any of 
the minors alive by late friday rescuers had found 36 bodies and 
had brought 30 bodies to the surface according to the company 
spokesman fifteen miners were still missing 
the first of the six survivors was brought to the surface early 
saturday morning about 60 hours after the explosion 
of the six five were west germans and one a turk there were 14 
turkish workers among the 57 miners trapped by the blast 
rescue workers said earlier that there were high concentrations 
of deadly carbon monoxide in the mine the radio report said the 
survivors may have been helped by fresh air pumped into the mine to 
aid the rescuers 
wednesdays blast at the stolzenbach mine in the town of borken 
72 miles northeast of frankfurt trapped the miners 330 feet below 
the surface the methane gas explosion rocked the ground like an 
earthquake 
on friday before the survivors were found grieving family 
members gathered at a makeshift morgue to say farewell to the 
victims of west germanys worst mining disaster in 26 years 
turkish immigrants were among the dead 
also friday heinzwerner meyer the head of the union 
representing 350000 west german miners and energy workers called 
for an improvement of safety underground 
a thorough investigation of the causes of the accident and the 
implementation of all possible safety measures are needed to 
minimize the danger of an accident meyer said in an interview on 
saarland radio 
but heinz cramer a member of the board of the company that owns 
the illfated mine said after the disaster all safety measures 
were adhered to 
a local prosecutor in the town of borken was investigating the 
accident to see if any criminal charges were warranted 
experts were still trying to determine what caused the blast 
rescue workers pulled the bodies to the surface using breathing 
masks to shield them against dangerous levels of the deadly carbon 
monoxide that had killed some of the miners 
many of the miners whose bodies have been retrieved suffocated 
from lack of air after their emergency breathing masks ran out of 
oxygen while others died from their injuries officials said 
the blast killed about onethird of the work force at the 
preussen elektra mine the company is the leading employer in 
borken and one of west germanys largest utilities 
peter carl ruehland spokesman for preussen elektra said the 
company would pay funeral costs and the costs of flying the 
immigrant workers bodies back to turkey if family members 
requested it 
the borken explosion is the worst west german mining accident 
since 299 men died in 1962 at the luisenthal mine in saarland state 
along the border with france

prime minister margaret thatcher said mikhail s 
gorbachev has to reform the soviet union because his people can no 
longer endure their military burden 
they could not have gone on surviving as they were the 
british leader told a television interviewer at her 10 downing 
street office friday night 
she spoke a few hours after saying goodbye to president reagan 
who stopped over in london on his way home after his moscow summit 
with gorbachev 
in a separate interview with commercial independent television 
news mrs thatcher said she knew it was impossible for the two 
superpower leaders to reach agreement on strategic nuclear arms 
reductions this week in moscow 
she said it is a very complicated equation i knew it was not 
possible to do it so i think did mr gorbachev 
speaking to the british broadcasting corp program 
newsnight mrs thatcher who herself met with gorbachev in 
moscow in spring 1987 said i had the feeling that certainly 
many people at the top in the soviet union and i believe many 
other people as well knew they could not have gone on surviving 
as they were 
they could not go on with that military strength because 
people wanted a higher standard of living 
they had to change and when you change you do not know quite 
the speed at which it will go you do not know the difficulties 
she said 
gorbachev has pushed a wideranging program of social and 
economic reforms which he calls perestroika or restructuring 
the londonbased international institute for strategic studies 
said in its annual the military balance in november that 
while there was very little reliable information on soviet defense 
spending over the past year it had announced at the end of 1986 a 
record defense budget of 304 billion 
however the institute said most western observers believed the 
announced soviet defense figures are only onetenth or less of what 
is actually spent us officials have put soviet defense spending 
at 16 to 17 percent of the countrys gross national product 
the institute said that would amount to 700 billion compared 
to the us congressionallyapproved figure of 296 billion for the 
1988 us defense budget 
mrs thatcher described gorbachevs vision for his country as a 
miracle and said he was sticking to his reforming vision with 
great constancy and determination

landslides closed two roads several water mains also burst 
because of the tremor 
the new zealand seismological observatory said the quake was 
similar to the one which caused severe damage to the town of 
edgecumbe and other parts of the bay of plenty district in march 
last year 
if it had occured in a more populated area there would likely 
have been a lot of damage said dr ewan smith seismologist at 
the wellington observatory 
senior constable lloyd matheson of te anau police station 
described the quake as a very strong rocking motion shuddering 
with a large roaring noise 
in addition to cutting power to an estimated 40000 consumers in 
christchurch the quake interrupted power supplies to the town of 
te anau and parts of the city of invercargill 80 miles south of 
the lake police said 
the richter scale is an openended gauge of energy released by 
an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe damage in a 
populated area

an army sergeant decorated 
for heroism in vietnam was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 
ordered discharged for passing military documents to an fbi agent 
posing as a soviet spy 
the military jury that convicted and sentenced sgt daniel 
walter richardson 42 on friday also fined him 36000 demoted 
him and stripped him of his army pension 
richardson whose 19 years in the army include 2 tours of duty 
in vietnam a commendation for heroism while there and other 
honors was to begin serving the prison term immediately 
im still taking care of business right now the oakland 
calif native said my lawyers have advised me not to say 
anything at this time 
the jury found richardson guilty of selling unclassified pages 
from a military manual and describing circuitry in the m1 tank on 
jan 13 but acquitted him of a charge that he met with the fbi 
agent jan 14 and accepted a 1500 down payment on a 50000 deal 
before his arrest that day 
richardson contended throughout his weeklong courtmartial at 
this army base nearly 10 miles northeast of baltimore that he was 
not trying to sell out his country but was trying to catch a spy 
to impress his superiors 
he was convicted of attempted espionage stealing government 
property the unauthorized sale of government property and failure 
to report an attempt by an unauthorized person to obtain classified 
information but was cleared of a second count of attempted 
espionage 
richardson was demoted from a class e5 sergeant to an e1 
cutting his pay in half until his discharge which will become 
effective after the sentence is reviewed 
the conviction and sentence must be approved by the commander of 
aberdeen proving ground maj gen george akin and automatically 
will be appealed to the army court of military review 
if the conviction is upheld richardson will receive a 
badconduct discharge and will lose all pay and pension benefits 
said army spokesman r rex brookshire 
the jury took 2 hours to decide on the sentence 
defense attorney david heubeck said he believed the panel did 
not hand his client the maximum penalty of life in prison because 
lawyers described him as a man who loved his country was 
distraught over the 1987 slaying of his son and was troubled by 
alcoholism depression and gambling problems 
richardsons stepbrother frank workman testified that he 
believed the defendants account he did it to catch a spy its 
plain and simple 
prosecutors portrayed richardson as a greedy vengeful man who 
was willing to jeopardize national security for money 
he has an antisocial personality said the chief 
prosecutor capt wellington t matthews jr hes a crook hes a 
criminal 
according to testimony richardson phoned the soviet embassy in 
washington in july 1986 eighteen months later the fbi agent 
called him posing as a soviet operative 
richardson had been demoted from instructor in the tank turret 
division at the proving ground to supervisor of the tool room for 
repeatedly failing to show up for work 
i figured that i needed to do something to get everybody off 
my back so i called the russian embassy to try to get a kgb 
agent richardson testified thursday 
it seemed like everything i tried to do right it got screwed 
up he said i felt that i was under so much pressure all the 
time i felt like i was going to explode from the inside out

attorney general edwin meese iii asked about a 
contract for wedtech corp a witness in the racketeering trial 
involving the scandalplagued defense contractor said in the first 
testimony on what meese allegedly said 
meese has denied helping the bronx contractor obtain the navy 
pontoon contract 
however former wedtech president anthony guariglia on friday 
testified at the us district court trial of us rep mario 
biaggi and six others that meese asked about the contract at a 
diplomatic ball in washington in 1985 
biaggi and the others are accused of turning wedtech which is 
now in bankruptcy into a racketeering enterprise for the payment 
of bribes to obtain nobid government contracts 
guariglia is the last of four former wedtech officials who have 
pleaded guilty to corruption charges to testify at the trial in 
exchange for leniency 
he was the first witness to testify at the 13weekold trial 
about anything meese allegedly said about the contract 
guariglia and other company officials have said they paid 
800000 to attorney e robert wallach a close friend and 
associate of meese to influence the attorney general 
they have said wallach told them he got meese to intercede on 
wedtechs behalf for a series of contracts worth 143 million to 
build pontoons 
wallach is under indictment on federal racketeering charges for 
allegedly taking payoffs from wedtech officials to influence meese 
and other public officials 
guariglia told the jury that wallach introduced him wedtech 
founder john mariotta and other company officials to meese and his 
wife at an ambassadors ball in washington 
mr wallach said to mr meese what a fine job we were doing in 
the south bronx that the company was growing and employment was 
growing said guariglia 
mr meese asked how we were doing with the pontoon contract 
mr mariotta said fine mr meese asked if we were on time with 
our deliveries and i believe mr mariotta said fine and that 
was the end of the meeting 
meese who has not been charged with any wrongdoing has denied 
any involvement in that contract but admitted intervening with the 
army to help wedtech win an engine contract in 1982 while he was 
presidential counselor 
meese attorney nathan lewin said friday that because the 
attorney general was in germany i cant give any direct comment 
on whether he recalls or doesnt recall making that statement 
if that statement was made by him meese it is consistent 
with his statements concerning his limited involvement or knowledge 
of wedtech matters said lewin reached at his washington office 
lewin said meese has acknowledged that he had been told by 
wallach that wedtech had obtained a pontoon contract

now that president jose sarney has won 
his coveted fifth year in office brazilians say he has also lost 
his excuse for not boosting the nations faltering economy 
congressmen even leftists opposed to sarney expressed relief 
the controversial issue was finally laid to rest when lawmakers on 
thursday gave him his longsought extra year 
however many also said it was time for sarney to show his stuff 
now he has no more excuses said rep delfin netto 
added sen mario covas well see if finally his government 
takes some initiative 
for his part the president promised action i will now 
perform my duties with even more responsibility said sarney the 
nations first civilian leader after 21 years of military rule 
legislators who since february have been rewriting brazils 
eighth constitution voted in an historic session to give sarney 
the five years he fought so hard for the vote was 328 in favor 
222 against with three abstentions 
the vote means 75 million brazilians including a generation in 
their 40s who have never voted for president will go to the polls 
in november 1989 29 years after the last presidential balloting 
polls have shown in the past year that most people in this 
country of 143 million people wanted elections for president in 
november 1988 instead elections will be held a year later and 
sarney will step down in march 15 1990 
sarney has said he has been hostage to the constituent 
assembly which took nearly a year and a half to lengthen his 
fouryear term 
the president said uncertainty over his political future was at 
the center of brazils tripledigit inflation which has hit an 
alltime high under his administration 
sarney also said he needed an extra year to consolidate brazils 
transition to democracy he said it would help in negotiations with 
the international monetary fund and international bankers on 
brazils 121 billion debt 
he further hinted brazils democracy was at risk if he was 
ousted after a fouryear term meaning brazils armed forces 
wouldnt accept elections this year for fear of a leftist surge 
yet opponents of the fiveyear term see it differently 
sarney critics who crowded the public stands as voting took 
place thursday unfurled a flag reading five years betrayal to 
the people 
sarneys term was up for a vote because he was not popularly 
elected the 57yearold provincial politician and poet from the 
poor northeastern state of maranhao came to power as the vice 
president for the popular statesman tancredo neves who died before 
taking office 
they were elected in indirect electoral college voting called by 
military generals who put sarney on the neves ticket the vote was 
to pave the way for nonmiliary rule in this country where the 
armed forces had governed since a 1964 coup 
although legally entitled to six years under the existing 
constitution neves promised his transition government would end 
after four years and that the constituent assembly would decide on 
the next elections 
sarney initially said he only wanted a fouryear term last 
year he said he needed another year because he had been unable to 
put into effect the government programs he wanted and that there 
was political uncertainty 
newspapers criticized the longer term and charged sarney used 
his political influence unethically 
the powerful daily folha de sao paulo wrote the fiveyear 
vote cost how many privileges and at what cost to the taxpayer 
the influential rio de janeiro newspaper said president 
sarney obtained what he wanted a fifth year to try to do what he 
was uncapable of doing in three

president corazon aquino to allow marcos to return for the funeral 
said they had not yet set a burial date it has been one month 
since 95yearold josefa edralinmarcos died 
todays 90minute procession accompanied her body from a 
suburban roman catholic church where it had lain in state to her 
home several blocks away 
at least four police cars headed the procession traffic jammed 
on many streets as the procession inched its way to the house in 
the manila suburb of san juan 
mrs edralinmarcos body had been kept at the santuario de san 
jose church since she died in a hospital on may 4 
her two children in manila pacifico marcos and fortuna 
marcosbarba had set no date for the funeral in hope that their 
exiled brother would be allowed to attend the burial 
mrs aquino has repeatedly said she wont allow marcos to return 
to the country for fear his presence would endanger national 
security 
marcos supporters have held numerous street demonstrations 
since mrs edralinmarcos death to demand that mrs aquino change 
her mind and allow him to return 
marcos lives in hawaii where he fled with his immediate family 
after the february 1986 civilian and military revolt that ended his 
20year rule and swept mrs aquino to power 
asked when the funeral would be held pacifico marcos said 
its very hard to predict he said he was still hoping his 
elder brother would be able to come home for the burial

telephone marcos in honolulu in two or three days to set a date for 
the funeral in the familys hometown of batac 240 miles north of

here is the text of casey at the bat by 
ernest l thayer 
 
the outlook wasnt brilliant for the mudville nine that day 
the score stood four to two with but one inning more to play 
and then cooney died at first and barrows did the same 
a sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game 
 
a straggling few got up to go in deep despair the rest 
clung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast 
they thought if only casey could but get a whack at that 
wed put up even money now with casey at the bat 
 
but flynn preceded casey as did also jimmy blake 
and the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake 
so upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat 
for there seemed but little chance of caseys getting to the bat 
 
but flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all 
and blake the much despised tore the cover off the ball 
and when the dust had lifted and the men saw what had occurred 
there was johnnie safe at second and flynn ahugging third 
 
then from 5000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell 
it rumbled through the valley it rattled in the dell 
it knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat 
for casey mighty casey was advancing to the bat 
 
there was ease in caseys manner as he stepped into his place 
there was pride in caseys bearing and a smile on caseys face 
and when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat 
no stranger in the crowd could doubt twas casey at the bat 
 
ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt 
five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt 
then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip 
defiance gleamed in caseys eye a sneer curled caseys lip 
 
and now the leathercovered sphere came hurtling through the air 
and casey stood awatching it in haughty grandeur there 
close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped 
that aint my style said casey strike one the umpire 
said 
 
from the benches black with people there went up a muffled 
roar 
like the beating of the stormwaves on a stern and distant shore 
kill him kill the umpire shouted some one on the stand 
and its likely theyd have killed him had not casey raised his 
hand 
 
with a smile of christian charity great caseys visage shone 
he stilled the rising tumult he bade the game go on 
he signaled to the pitcher and once more the spheroid flew 
but casey still ignored it and the umpire said strike two 
 
fraud cried the maddened thousands and echo answered fraud 
but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed 
they saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles 
strain 
and they knew that casey wouldnt let the ball go by again 
 
the sneer is gone from caseys lip his teeth are clenched in 
hate 
he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate 
and now the pitcher holds the ball and now he lets it go 
and now the air is shattered by the force of caseys blow 
 
oh somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright 
the band is playing somewhere and somewhere hearts are light 
and somewhere men are laughing and somewhere children shout 
but there is no joy in mudville mighty casey has struck out

divers have discovered 55 japanese warships 
cargo boats and submarines sunk during world war ii off palau in 
the western pacific ocean the government announced 
no one knew they were there government spokesman bonifacio 
basilius said friday 
elderly palauans believe the vessels were part of the japanese 
fleet used to protect the philippines that had moved to malakal 
harbor off koror palaus capital basilius said 
japanese ships anchored at malakal and airai harbor were 
attacked by us carrierbased fighter planes in march and july 
1944 he said 
japan occupied palau which is about 600 miles east of the 
philippines and nearly 2000 miles south of tokyo from 1922 until 
american forces captured the island chain in 1945 
the ships were found during the past four weeks by us navy 
reservists on summer duty from honolulu long beach calif san 
diego and texas basilius said 
the us national park service has been locating and marking 
sunken ships the spokesman said the joint park servicenavy 
project is expected to end in two weeks 
most of the search has been in and around palaus rock islands 
which are limestone coral reefs with a mushroomlike appearance 
created by wave erosion none are inhabited 
the divers are using underwater robots with cameras basilius 
said none of the ships were visible from the ocean surface and 
some have been found in waters 150 feet deep most were less than 
five miles from shore 
divers were able to read the names on five of the ships which 
they described as in good shape for being under water for more than 
40 years basilius said the warships seemed to be destroyers 
palauans have known about a dozen other sunken japanese ships

a state jury cleared a blood bank of liability in 
the aids infection of a woman who received a tainted transfusion 
and a defense attorney said it was a victory for blood banks facing 
similar lawsuits 
the denver district court jury on friday found united blood 
services not liable for damages in the case of susie quintana 50 
of dolores who contracted aids from a 1983 transfusion after an 
accidental gunshot wound the blood was from the united blood 
services bank in albuquerque nm 
the sixmember jury thursday ordered an infectious disease 
expert whose aids test falsely found mrs quintana free of the 
virus to pay 70000 in damages but found no liability on the part 
of her former family doctor 
lawyers have said the case may be the first in the nation in 
which a jury decided an aids victims claim against a blood bank 
in a similar case in california in 1986 a settlement was reached 
before the trial ended 
there are many lawsuits and they the jurors have done a 
great service to blood banks around the country defense attorney 
steve labensky said after the verdict defense attorneys around 
the country were watching this a victory here will probably assure 
a victory elsewhere 
wiping tears from her eyes mrs quintana said she knew the jury 
faced a tough decision in her case but it means aids 
patients will just have to keep fighting said the mother of 
four ive fought this thing every since i found out i had it 
and ill continue to fight it 
mrs quintana and her 53yearold husband chris have not 
decided whether to appeal said their attorney maureen reidy witt 
the southwest colorado couples suit sought unspecified damages 
but witt asked the jury in closing arguments to award quintanas 
more than 13 million 
the jury said the infectious disease expert dr donald kearns 
was liable because he failed to explain precautions the couple 
should have taken to avoid exposing mrs quintanas husband to 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
although the quintanas testified they had sex after the tests 
quintana has tested negative for the aids virus 
dr edward g merritt the former family physician was also 
accused of failing to diagnose the virus and not recommending 
precautions but was found not liable 
the couples lawsuit named the blood bank kearns and merritt 
the quintanas did not sue southwest memorial hospital in cortez 
where mrs quintana received the transfusion 
in closing arguments witt said the blood bank was negligent for 
failing to properly screen donors and test its blood supply 
she said testing routinely used at the time to detect the 
hepatitisb virus in blood could have been useful in eliminating 
homosexual blood donors who are at high risk for that disease as 
well as aids 
douglas irish an attorney for the blood bank said tests for 
aids in blood were not available until two years after mrs 
quintanas transfusion 
labensky said his client felt what they were doing was 
reasonably prudent at the time and apparently the jurors agreed 
jurors said they had difficulty deciding what aids screening 
standards were at the time and whether the blood bank lived up to 
them 
three of us felt they met the industrys requirements and 
three did not said foreman albert gonzales i was surprised we 
came up with an answer 
while there was tremendous sympathy for mrs quintana and her 
family we had to set that aside and look at the evidence 
aids breaks down the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

a leading us arms official said today that it 
is still theoretically possible for the superpowers to reach an 
accord on longrange nuclear weapons before president reagan leaves 
office 
however edward rowny who serves as special adviser to the 
president and secretary of state on arms control said serious 
obstacles remain 
if the soviets were to work as hard and as fast as they worked 
the last couple days in moscow yes we could have a treaty 
rowny said at a news conference it remains to be seen whether 
they will show that much interest 
rowny came to beijing to brief chinese officials on the 
justended moscow summit soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 
reagan whose term ends this year 
i dont want to say there couldnt be a start strategic or 
longrange nuclear arms agreement im also saying its extremely 
difficult and many many difficult issues remain he said 
among those issues are verification of air and sealaunched 
cruise missiles and mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles as 
well as differences over reagans socalled star wars plan to put 
defensive weapons in space he said 
rowny said washington recognizes chinas support in bringing 
about the justsigned sovietus treaty to abolish 
intermediaterange missiles he declined to characterize his 
meetings today with vice foreign minister zhu qizhen and other 
chinese officials saying only i get good questions and good 
support from the chinese 
the official chinese media has been mildly critical of the 
fourth reagangorbachev summit particularly on the issue of 
disarmament 
this summit had few concrete achievements to its credit the 
official china daily said today in an editorial 
the people of the world it said are happy to see ussoviet 
dialogue but are far from satisfied when it the summit ended 
without a breakthrough in the talks on a treaty cutting by half the 
strategic offensive nuclear arsenals of both superpowers which the 
summit was previously intended for 
rowny said we believe we have done all that the traffic will 
bear on strategic disarmament for now 
he also expressed concern that momentum on arms control will be 
lost as gorbachev and other soviet leaders prepare for a major 
communist party meeting in the coming weeks 
hell be distracted and others will be distracted he said

at least 27 gold miners were 
believed killed when mine tunnels crudely dug on a remote 
mountainside caved in after a heavy rain a local official said 
today 
one miner was rescued by fellow workers shortly after the 
accident occurred friday night but his left leg was so badly 
injured that doctors had to amputate it when he arrived at a 
hospital here today the official said 
benito tolentino mayor of the municipality of sibutad where the 
cavein occurred told reporters that a lack of equipment was 
hampering rescue efforts on mount lablab 30 miles from here and 
450 miles southeast of manila 
tolentino who accompanied the unidentified survivor to report 
the accident said rescuers were armed only with picks and shovels 
and were having difficulty reaching the trapped miners

the rhode island house passed a sweeping 
bill requiring the aids virus test for all prison inmates and for 
marriage license applicants hospital patients and others unless 
they sign a waiver 
i think its something everyone can live with rep anthony 
carnevale jr democratic chairman of the house health education 
and welfare committee said following the action friday 
the measure was expected to receive senate approval it closely 
resembles a bill originally proposed by republican gov edward d 
diprete and he said he would sign it 
the bill would require the test for the virus that causes 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome for prison inmates and people 
convicted of prostitution and intravenous drug use 
it requires that marriage license applicants hospital patients 
and clients of family planning and sexually transmitted disease 
clinics be tested unless they sign a waiver 
the bill contains language to prevent discrimination against 
those who carry or are perceived to carry the virus it requires 
health care providers to report the names of those testing positive 
to the state department of health 
rhode island has been a national leader on the aids problem 
diprete said i think youll soon find other states following our 
leadership 
as of jan 1 illinois has required marriage license applicants 
to take the test 
the house also approved two of five proposed amendments the 
bill was expanded to include testing for disability insurance 
applicants and a provision was dropped that would have seen the 
measure expire july 1 1990 if insurance companies had not 
established a highrisk insurance pool for those who test positive 
by then 
if the insurers dont want to come through the way they say 
they will you will already be back in session and can deal with 
it then carnevale told the house 
legislators tabled an amendment to require physicians only to 
inform marriage applicants of the hazards of aids and the 
availability of tests 
rep nicholas tsiongas pleaded passionately for dropping the 
requirement that the names of those testing positive be reported to 
authorities 
the democrat who is the legislatures only physician said a 
central registry would deter those in highrisk groups from being 
tested the house rejected his amendment 
the house also defeated an amendment to remove 
antidiscrimination language 
this is a health care bill and not one that emphasizes civil 
rights said rep bradford gorham the amendments republican 
sponsor what were doing is saying people with aids have all 
sorts of rights that those people with other deadly diseases 
dont he argued 
carnevale disagreed its the heart of the bill you cant 
tell someone to be tested without giving them protection 
rep ray rickman a democrat who voted against the bill said it 
would waste enormous sums of money testing people not at high risk

the italian government today agreed to accept the 
us f16 fighter planes being evicted from spain a cabinet 
minister announced 
the decision which had been expected followed a formal request 
from nato to transfer the 72 nuclearcapable jet fighters to italy 
the planes which make up the us air forces 401st tactical 
fighter wing are now based at torrejon air base near madrid spain 
has said they must be withdrawn within three years 
remo gaspari a christian democrat minister announced the 
decision to reporters while the cabinet meeting led by premier 
ciriaco de mita was still under way 
we have taken the decision naturally hoping it will be like 
the missiles in comiso gaspari said 
comiso is the sicilian base where us cruise missiles were 
installed as part of natos response to a soviet missile buildup 
the missiles will now be removed from comiso under the ussoviet 
treaty on mediumrange nuclear missiles 
there was no immediate announcement on where in italy the planes 
will be based 
italian government officials have said the transfering of the 
f16s would be examined by parliament but that a vote would likely 
not be needed 
the communists italys second largest party are opposed to the 
transfer but de mitas coalition of his christian democrats 
together with socialists republicans social democrats and 
liberals has a comfortable majority in both houses 
natos defense ministers made the formal request to italy during 
a meeting in brussels on may 26 
lord carrington secretary general of the western alliance said 
then that the planes represent a considerable portion of our 
strength in the southern region

an opposition leader accused the 
government today of holding him and six other political activists 
on false charges and demanded freedom for other political prisoners 
in malaysia 
we have been detained under trumpedup charges said tan 
seng giaw vice chairman of the opposition democratic action party 
who was released friday after spending more than six months in jail 
another opposition leader also released said he was looking 
forward to getting back to politics and union work and that the 
prison experience had left him unbowed 
i want the prime minister to release all those who were 
arrested with me and are being held under the isa tan said 
during the conference held at the partys national headquarters 
tan was referring to malaysias internal security act which 
allows imprisonment without trial for activities which challenge 
the malaysian government under the act individuals may be 
imprisoned indefinitely with a board reviewing the detention every 
six months 
prime minister mahathir mohamad later told reporters the 
government does not intend to detain forever those arrested under 
the isa 
we are not keeping them forever it depends on them he said 
when commenting on fridays release mahathir said the prisoners 
would get a fair review in front of the appeal board 
the bespectacled tan stroking a goatie beard grown while he was 
in the kamunting prison near ipoh said he had not been subjected 
to physical torture 
tan came to the press conference directly from the prison 120 
miles north of here 
the six others released friday included opposition figures a 
christian social worker a university lecturer and chinese 
educators 
tan said the conditions for his release restrict him to his home 
at night and he must tell police when he plans to leave the kuala 
lumpur area 
the acting secretary general of tans party lee lam thye said 
the party launched a signature campaign to urge the prime minister 
to release the remaining detainees 
a total of 109 people were detained during a twomonth period 
beginning last october tan was jailed on nov 2 1987 
prime minister mohamad mahathir has maintained the detentions 
were necessary because the individuals contributed to racial 
tension and their arrests were needed to prevent malaychinese 
racial clashes 
on oct 28 last year the government also banned the 
englishlanguage star daily the chineselanguage sin chew jit poh 
daily and the malay biweekly watan for fanning racial tension 
tan said that while in jail the detainees were allowed to 
exercise and read but newspapers and magazines were censored 
before delivery 
asked if he was interrogated tan replied what is there to 
interrogate he said he had not advocated violence and that he 
was not a subversive 
tan added the detention has not changed his views in any way and 
he was determined to continue his fight for a better country for 
all 
the 46yearold physician was joined by his wife and two 
daughters after the conference 
democratic action party parliamentarian and central committee 
member vethamuthu david who was also released said detention was 
difficult but that it failed to change his political views 
david at a press conference at his residence today said he was 
looking forward to going back to his political and union work 
david is secretary general of the malaysian trades union 
congress and general secretary of the transport workers union he 
denied he had fanned racial tensions

the prosecutors in former gov evan 
mechams criminal trial asked that the jury be allowed to see a set 
of notes once considered a smoking gun in the charge he 
concealed a 300000 campaign loan 
maricopa county superior court judge michael ryan said friday he 
would rule before the trial resumes monday on whether to allow 
testimony on the three pages of notes by vern gasser a former 
member of the mecham finance committee 
meanwhile former us rep sam steiger who was convicted of 
pressuring a parole board member while working as a gubernatorial 
aide to mecham was sentenced friday to four years probation a 
5480 fine and 700 hours of community service 
steiger 59 was convicted april 7 of theft by extortion in 
threatening board of pardons and paroles member ron johnson over a 
personnel vote 
mecham and his brother willard are charged with concealing the 
350000 loan from tempe developer barry wolfson willard mecham 
was his brothers 1986 campaign treasurer 
the notes which gasser took during a finance committee meeting 
in fall 1986 were considered a smoking gun against mecham 
during januarys house impeachment hearings the notes say show 
evan borrowed money and dont show borrowed money 
however gasser said in court friday he could not recall who 
made the statements or who attended the meeting 
in arguments with the jury absent willard mechams lawyer joe 
keilp said the notes and testimony should not be admitted keilp 
said he feared there would be implications that willard mecham may 
have made the statements gassers notes referred to 
prosecutor barnett lotstein said the notes should be admitted 
because they referred to a meeting involving mecham campaign 
strategists 
earlier friday ryan rejected a motion for a mistrial by the 
defense which contended the prosecution presented improper 
evidence implying wrongdoing in the handling of the mecham 
campaigns checkbook 
the judge said he thought the testimony thursday from a state 
handwriting expert was quite innocuous and may prove relevant 
regarding willard mechams bookkeeping practices 
handwriting expert william flynn had testified there had been a 
number of whiteouts erasures and alterations in the checkbook 
he did not speculate on the reasons for the changes 
the mecham brothers sat with their attorneys and declined to 
talk to reporters 
jurors were read parts of willard mechams january testimony to 
the state grand jury in which he denied wrongdoing when he lumped 
the 350000 loan into a 465000 total listed on financial reports 
as a contribution from evan mecham 
i felt he evan mecham would eventually be responsible for 
paying it back willard mecham told the grand jury i didnt 
feel i was doing anything wrong at the time and certainly didnt 
feel i was violating the law 
the transcript also showed willard mecham said he did not know 
until after the loans existence was diclosed by the news media 
about a letter in which his brother promised wolfson the loan would 
remain confidential 
willard mecham testified at the time that he was told by the 
secretary of states office that similar amounts could be lumped 
together but he did not ask whether amounts from different sources 
could be combined 
if convicted on all six counts of perjury willful concealment 
and filing false documents evan mecham faces up to 22 years in 
prison willard mecham faces three similar counts and up to 9 
years in prison if convicted 
the firstterm republican governor was removed from office april

counts

a radical protester tried to burn 
himself to death and four student leaders were arrested at a us 
army base today as the government ordered a crackdown on violent 
unrest 
a student identified as park raechun 24 doused himself with 
inflammable liquid and ignited it in an antigovernment protest at 
soongshil university in southern seoul 
overthrow military fascists park shouted before setting 
himself afire hospital officials said he was in critical condition 
two other radical students have killed themselves in the past 
month as part of antigovernment protests ritual suicide is a 
traditional form of protest to try to shame the government 
four radical student leaders were arrested at us army 
headquarters in seoul after they tried to force their way through 
its main gate the students who were seized by south korean 
police wanted to see us army commander gen louis menetrey to 
demand permission to march to the north korean border 
radical students plan to march to the communist north korean 
border june 10 to try to force reunification of the divided korean 
peninsula a us army spokesman said that only the south korean 
government can grant permission for civilians to visit the border 
and that it was a purely domestic matter 
meanwhile prime minister lee hyunjae warned in a nationally 
televised speech that the government would not tolerate violent 
protests by radical students and striking workers he said the 
government was determined to maintain law and order 
the government will sternly deal with all violent acts he 
said 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests in recent 
weeks with students demonstrating against the government and the 
united states in addition striking factory workers have been 
seeking pay hikes 
authorities said students attacked two police stations in the 
southern city of kwangju with firebombs before dawn today and 
caused minor damage no arrests or injuries were reported 
lee accused radical students who plan to march to the border 
june 10 of being pronorth korean and threatening the safety of 
south korea the prowestern south and the totalitarian north are 
bitter enemies who often clash 
north korea has been strengthening its stance apparently 
encouraged by south korean students lee said 
radical students plan to march june 10 to the border truce site 
of panmunjom to meet with north korean students and reunite the two 
nations 
unification of the two koreas divided since 1945 is a highly 
emotional issue for many koreans and radicals have been attempting 
to use it to gain support most people in the south are distrustful 
of the north which invaded the south in 1950 and started the 
korean war 
the prime minister said the government agreed free discussion of 
reunification was necessary even though authorities limited the 
issue in the past 
students elected 13 representatives at a meeting today at yonsei 
university in seoul to take part in the proposed talks with north 
korean students some students yelled yankee go home and 
unite the fatherland 
four student leaders then went to the us army headquarters to 
demand they be allowed to go to the border next week the panmunjom 
truce site is under us military control 
the four were seized by police as soon as they arrived at the 
us base a us officer briefly met with one of the leaders 
before they were taken away by police as they yelled antius 
slogans 
police repeated warnings today that students would not be 
allowed to march to the border and said anyone doing so would be 
arrested the heavily militarized border 30 miles north of seoul is 
off limits to civilians 
radical students have been pushing for reunification with the 
north claiming that the united states enforces the division so it 
can rule the south as a colony the students demand expulsion of 
42000 us troops based in the south under a defense treaty

party leaders in the capital restored the names of 
many reformers to ballots for a key communist conference over 
conservative objections but a list published today showed some 
reformers lost election 
mikhail s gorbachev and five other members of the ruling 
politburo including kgb chairman viktor m chebrikov and kremlin 
no 2 yegor k ligachev were among 319 delegates elected after 
what media accounts described as sharp debates at a moscow party 
meeting to name delegates on friday 
the delegate battle has been the talk of moscow for days as the 
staterun media and even political street protests unusual for the 
soviet union brought the internal party battle over reform into 
the open 
late friday the staterun media reported that the moscow party 
hierarchy had restored the names of prominent intellectual 
reformers who had been axed from the delegate list in initial 
politicking at precinct level 
but a final list of the 319 moscow delegates published today in 
moscows communist party daily moskovskaya pravda showed that key 
reformers such as sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya playwright 
mikhail shatrov and economist nikolai shmelev had not won election 
in secret ballots 
filmmaker elem klimov and economist leonid abalkin other 
liberals who were restored were named as delegates however 
vitaly korotich editor of the proreform weekly ogonyok was 
one moscowbased reformers eased off the delegate list in moscow 
but staterun media now say the ukrainianborn writer will be a 
delegate for kherson a ukrainian port city on the black sea 
it was not clear whether other reformers would be named 
delegates from other regions of the vast nation 
the openness of the battle in moscow and the restoration of 
reformers to the delegate list by the city party hierarchy could 
affect similar battles reported by staterun media to be going on 
across the country 
with close to 1 million members many of them the nations 
leading intellectuals and officials the moscow communist party is 
the nations largest most prestigious and influential party body 
gorbachev himself attended the meeting of moscow party leaders 
friday that named the final delegate list after weeks of discussion 
over who attends the conference due to open june 28 it will be 
the first of its kind since 1941 
moskovskaya pravda printed only a summary of his remarks and did 
not make clear whether gorbachev had spoken in favor of the 
restored candidacies or scolded party conservatives for attempting 
to ease out reformers 
other politburo members named as delegates are president andrei 
a gromyko moscow party boss lev n zaikov and premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov 
defense minister dmitri a yazov a candidate or nonvoting 
politburo member was also among those named as delegates 
other politburo members are likely to be elected from other 
parts of the country foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for 
instance has his communist party base in the southern republic of 
georgia 
one name not on the list of delegates was that of boris n 
yeltsin the former moscow party boss ousted in november after 
making a still unpublished speech to the central committee in which 
he is said to have fiercely criticized the pace of reform 
on monday yeltsin took the unprecedented step of using western 
television interviews to call for the resignation of ligachev on 
grounds he is is blocking more reform 
at an unprecedented moscow news conference on wednesday 
gorbachev denied there was any question of ligachevs removal but 
skirted mention of the party conference and the delegate battle 
ligachev has often appeared to be more cautious about reform 
than gorbachev and is widely rumored to head a conservative faction 
in the party 
there are expected to be about 5000 delegates to the 
conference which will consider a document published eight days ago 
outlining potentially radical reforms to introduce political 
accountability into the soviet unions oneparty system 
it is felt that the reforms most of which are vaguely outlined 
in the document could be in jeopardy if conservatives dominate the 
conference hall 
ms zaslavskaya and other reformers noted in the preconference 
maneuvering that it would be even more important which of the 
delegates gets the privilege of speaking at the party conference 
whose duration is so far uncertain 
the moskovskaya pravda list showed that the delegates 
represented all walks of soviet life the military science the 
arts economists industrial managers and workers

mickelson now governor himself planned to help ziolkowskis 
widow set off another explosion today to mark the 40th anniversary 
of the start of that project which is still under way in western 
south dakota 
mickelson said his return to crazy horse memorial about 10 
miles west of mount rushmore national memorial would follow the 
indian theme that life moves in circles 
weve now come full circle mickelson said its something 
ive kind of grown up with its special to me 
ziolkowski died in 1982 at age 74 his wife ruth and eight of 
their 10 children have continued to blast and carve thunderhead 
mountain 
mickelson said he remembers that at the time of the first blast 
many people were skeptical whether the project would be completed 
he said that over the years hes seen the dedication of ziolkowski 
and his family keep the dream alive as rock has been steadily 
removed from the mountain 
the project not only draws more than 1 million tourists a year 
to help the black hills economy but also helps improve relations 
between indians and nonindians the governor said 
we tend to focus too much on our differences when in fact 
this gives us an opportunity to give a prominent role to a great 
indian leader mickelson said 
crazy horse helped lead the indians who defeated gen george 
custer at the 1876 battle of the little big horn in montana but 
after he and 1000 starving followers were forced to surrender he 
was killed by a soldiers bayonet in prison in 1877 at an estimated 
age of 34 
five indians who fought with crazy horse at little big horn 
attended the first blast on the mountain 
when completed a statue 563 feet tall and 641 feet long will 
show crazy horse astride a horse and pointing east to the plains 
the statue will be so large that all four presidents heads on 
mount rushmore would fit inside crazy horses head and a 10story 
building could stand in the opening between the horses back and 
the indians outstretched arm 
ziolkowski said the statue would depict crazy horses answer to 
a white man who asked what had become of his lands crazy horse 
pointed over his horses head and replied my lands are where my 
dead lie buried 
ziolkowski an acclaimed selftaught sculptor born in boston 
worked briefly at mount rushmore but didnt get along with chief 
sculptor gutzon borglum 
then some sioux leaders asked ziolkowski to create a monument 
my fellow chiefs and i would like the white man to know the red 
man had great heroes too wrote chief henry standing bear 
unlike mount rushmore crazy horse is being carved in the round 
so it can be viewed from all sides 
and also unlike rushmore ziolkowskis dream is financed 
strictly by private donations and entrance fees the mountain was 
purchased from the federal government and is owned by crazy horse 
memorial foundation 
about 82 million tons of rock have been removed from the 
mountain which can be worked only in the summer and it is 
beginning to take on the rough form of ziolkowskis dream 
family members say they dont know how long the project will 
take 
its 40 years we started with absolutely nothing if it 
hadnt been for korczak nobody would have started it mrs 
ziolkowski said as korczak said it isnt how fast you go its 
that you do it right and you never stop working

thurman z luke wore denim overalls and 
lived in what some considered a modest house but when the 
75yearold died he left a 275000 estate to the us treasury 
luke who died at his baxter home in east tennessee last march 
directed in his will that all his property be sold and the proceeds 
be given to the treasury to help pay off the national debt

brothers and sisters signed waivers declining administration of the 
will 
i have never been married and so i have no natural object of 
affection to whom to pass my estate luke said in the will 
luke grew up in appalachia and like many farm boys traveled to 
michigan in the 1940s when the auto industry thrived he served in 
world war ii and saved his army paychecks accumulating 17000 by 
the time he left the military 
he prearranged his burial and requested that no public 
announcement be made at the time of his death 
his only other request was that his rank in the military 
corporal be included on his tombstone 
friends said he frequently talked about the problems of the 
government and liked to discuss politics 
i would call him one of those naturalborn agitators a 
person that just delighted in arguing some issue said his first 
cousin billy luke of cookeville 
you know he just liked to take the other side to argue he 
was sharp and very well read especially on politics and history 
and he did worry about the government being in debt he said

a federal appeals court has affirmed the right 
of death row inmates to legal aid in what lawyers say is the first 
ruling of its kind in the nation though most states already 
guarantee such aid 
obviously were very pleased richmond attorney gerald 
zerkin said friday it resolves a very difficult situation in 
which men on death row did not have access to counsel to challenge 
their death sentences 
the ruling by the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld a 
1986 decision by us district judge robert r merhige jr that 
decision had been overturned last year by a threejudge panel of 
the appeals court 
fridays 64 ruling means that virginia will have to provide 
legal counsel for death row inmates who request representation for 
their appeals zerkin said he said the specifics of how 
representation will be provided remain to be worked out 
jonathan sasser a durham nc attorney involved in the case 
said the ruling gives impoverished death row prisoners access to 
the courts 
for a death row inmate in virginia it means you have to have 
a living breathing attorney to represent you he said from his 
durham office 
virginia law provides no guarantee of legal assistance once an 
inmates sentence has been affirmed by the state supreme court 
the 11page ruling is the first decision of its kind zerkin 
said but he added that it is grounded in the particular facts of 
virginias death row 
many i would say most states already provide representation 
without having been required to do so zerkin said 
the case was brought to federal court in 1986 by death row 
inmate joseph giarratano who was disturbed by the case of earl 
washington another death row inmate who could not afford a lawyer 
no volunteers could be found to handle washingtons case until 
about a week before his execution date when he won a stay his 
appeals are still continuing 
he was sitting there waiting to be executed and he couldnt do 
anything about it because he didnt have an attorney sasser 
said the importance of this case is that that wont happen 
again unless the supreme court reverses it

severe complications may result if people inject 
cocaine into their sex organs to enhance sexual performance or 
pleasure physicians warned in a leading medical journal 
a letter printed in fridays journal of the american medical 
association said one man who injected the drug into his urethra 
suffered gangrene that led to the amputation of both his legs nine 
fingers and his penis 
it was not clear how this use of cocaine led to such 
extravagant complications dr john c mahler and two 
colleagues at the new york hospitalcornell medical center said in 
the letter 
the 34yearold patient who was not identified was admitted to 
the hospital with an abnormally persistent erection he said had 
started three days before accompanied by painful swelling the 
doctors said 
the patient told doctors that prior to having sexual intercourse 
in previous weeks he had occasionally injected cocaine into his 
urethra the tube that carries urine out of the body 
the patient said he had taken the drug to enhance sexual 
performance the doctors said 
after three days of treatment the erection and swelling 
disappeared but the patient began developing blood clots in his 
limbs genitals back and chest and skin problems so severe that 
the patient had to be moved to the hospitals burn unit 
eventually due to necrosis and gangrene or the death of 
tissue doctors amputated the mans legs above his knee nine of 
his fingers and his penis 
the new york doctors said they were reporting the 1987 case to 
warn doctors about this new method of cocaine abuse and its 
rare and previously unreported complications 
injection or topical application of cocaine to sexual organs in 
a bid to heighten sexual pleasure has been reported but is not 
believed to be a widespread practice according to experts on 
sexuality and drug abuse cited in fridays editions of the new york 
times 
dr john money an expert in sexuality at johns hopkins medical 
school in baltimore expressed doubts whether cocaine alone could 
have produced the severe complications cited in the letter 
some other factor such as an impurity in the drug may have 
been the cause he said 
mahler said his team had considered such a possibility but 
found no evidence to document it

miami has adopted tampas plan to systematically 
demolish abandoned houses believed to harbor drug addicts and thugs 
heavy bulldozers razed two abandoned houses friday to initiate 
the crack attack designed to wipe out drug dens in declining 
neighborhoods 
this is the kind of fullforce effort we need in our city to 
get rid of the crack problem said vice mayor rosario kennedy 
ms kennedy with tampa mayor sandy freedman at her side went 
to the dilapidated overtown section of miami to announce the plan 
ms freedman began the policy last week when she coaxed private 
demolition companies to voluntarily level 50 vacant houses in three 
days 
on friday ms kennedy urged other cities to adopt the crack 
attack policy and raze unsafe abandoned structures that create a 
haven for drugs and crime she said miami had more than 100 such 
unsafe structures she would like to see demolished but first they 
have to go through routine condemnation procedures 
hector lima chief of the code enforcement department said 
miami has 238 buildings that are being condemned 
the miami demolition policy follows a rash of crackhouse 
burnings in march believed to be the work of antidrug vigilantes 
miami fire investigators instituted roundtheclock patrols of 
suspected crack houses looking for one or more arsonists but no 
one was arrested 
after advocating a publicprivate partnership in the demolition 
program the women climbed up onto a frontendloader and with the 
guidance of operator gerardo de aza crashed into one of the houses 
set for demolition 
the crack addicts are just going to go some place and do the 
same thing said 22yearold neighbor ruben santiago as he 
watched the media swarm around 
its not useless they can build something new there but 
demolition is not going to stop the drug dealing there will 
always be crack houses he said 
while city officials were not sure if the abandoned singlestory 
woodframe house had ever been the site of any arrests santiago 
said there had been several arrests there 
in his 15 years in the neighborhood santiago said the 
structure had been converted from a singlefamily home to a rooming 
house he said two years ago residents of the area had set the 
rooming house on fire to get rid of the crack addicts who lived 
there it had been a shell ever since 
angela m jordan said she had seen many drug buys on the corner 
where the house sat during her four months in the neighborhood 
that will sure get them off the corner she said as the 
house shook and piece fell in but if they dont sell drugs 
there theyll go some place else theyll find someplace to sell 
it

secretary of state george p shultz 
discussed his middle east peace plans with the leaders of egypt and 
jordan today and called for a settlement based on palestinian 
rights as well as israeli security 
this is not a matter of winnertakeall in which one side can 
win everything it wants he said in a prepared statement on 
arrival in jordan from egypt 
palestinians and israelis must learn to treat each other 
decently respect their mutual right to live in security and 
fulfill their political aspirations shultz said 
foreign minister taher masri met shultz at ammans military 
airport and escorted him to the royal palace where he had talks 
over lunch with king hussein 
in his arrival statement shultz said jordan has a crucial 
role to play in arab peace with its western neighbor israel 
shultz has stressed that israelis and palestinians both have 
legitimate claims to the land held by israel and said there is 
room for them to live together he listed as his first goal 
israels exchange of land for arab recognition 
second on his list in the arrival statement was a call for an 
equitable settlement of the land issue although he said it was 
up to the participants to decide how much territory israel should 
give up 
before leaving cairo shultz met with egyptian president hosni 
mubarak in private for about an hour then for another hour with 
aides 
were off to a good start i think shultz said following 
the talks 
shultz was due to fly back to cairo tonight 
in earlier remarks to reporters traveling with him the 
secretary conceded that he is shuttling again between arabs and 
israelis with no indication they are willing to accept his plan for 
negotiations 
the trip marks his fourth effort this year to provide 
palestinian arabs selfrule but not statehood as the first step 
toward setting up talks on an overall middle east settlement 
you have to be willing to work against the odds to swim 
against the current in the hope that by keeping at it eventually 
you get some way if you can shultz told reporters on his flight 
to cairo from london 
as he arrived friday night he read a fivepage statement 
exhorting arabs and israelis to lay aside prejudices hatred and 
overblown dreams in favor of a negotiated settlement 
his message seemed aimed at israels prime minister yitzhak 
shamir who resists ending israels occupation of west bank land in 
exchange for peace and at arab extremists seeking to overthrow the 
jewish state 
too often people become convinced that only their dream or 
their causes are legitimate shultz said they deny the rights 
of others they avoid the realism on the ground 
in deference to mubarak who has endorsed the us plan in 
principle shultz made cairo his base with todays flight to 
jordan and hops sunday to israel and monday to syria 
the trip was slotted in between the moscow superpower summit 
meeting in moscow and an arab summit opening tuesday in algeria 
the kremlin has backed arab demands for a peace conference in 
which the big powers including the soviet union could influence a 
settlement shamir and shultz want the conference to be no more 
than an umbrella for direct negotiations between arabs and israelis 
shultz suggested the soviets may be inching away from their 
position they have started to use the word effective rather 
than authoritative and theyve made a point of saying that 
wasnt a loose slip of the tongue he said 
according to reports in israel and the persian gulf shultz is 
thinking of revising his negotiation plan to provide for egyptian 
participation in deciding the future of the israeliheld gaza strip 
the reports have egyptians joining palestinians in a delegation 
dealing with gaza while jordan and another palestinian group would 
negotiate with israel over the west bank 
egypt administered gaza and jordan controlled the west bank 
until israel took both territories in the 1967 sixday war 
yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization said in an interview friday with radio monte carlo 
there cannot be a solution if the palestinian question is

residents of riverside and san 
bernardino counties were rattled by an earthquake that was widely 
felt but caused no injuries or damage authorities reported 
the quake measuring 38 on the richter scale struck at 532 
pm friday said hall daily a spokesman for the california 
institute of technology in pasadena 
it was centered six miles east of redlands near the boundary 
dividing the two counties and about 70 miles east of los angeles

it was strongly felt in riverside said kathy watts a 
scientist at the pasadena lab 
callers from san bernardino and from idyllwild in the san 
jacinto mountains also reported feeling the jolt 
but riverside police received no reports of injuries or damage 
sgt joanne flores said 
it wasnt that hard of an earthquake said lee hester a 
police dispatcher in hemet about 20 miles southeast of the 
epicenter he said no damage was reported there 
the richter scale is an indirect gauge of the energy released by 
an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph for small quakes every increase of one number means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 35 to 4 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area in places such as southern california 
where building codes are strict

room and showed good strength she has no sign of the neurological 
problem that necessitated the operation bander added shes 
doing very well her spirits good

flew back from san francisco canceling his last scheduled debate 
with rival jesse jackson to be with his wife of 25 years when she 
underwent urgent surgery to repair two herniated discs in her neck

and tingling sensations that had plagued her appeared gone 
the doctors said that if uncorrected the problem could have 
resulted in paralysis from the shoulders down

excellent 
dukakis praised the doctors as terrific and said were 
very very relieved and very pleased

dependency on amphetamines last year she revealed she had been 
addicted to the drug prescribed as diet pills for 26 years before 
shaking the dependency at a drug clinic in 1982

a cook county hospital doctor who won a court 
battle to keep his job even though he suffered from aids has died 
officials said 
dr alan bouffard 42 a neurologist headed the neurology clinic 
and electroencephalographic laboratory at the hospital officials 
said his name was not released during the court proceedings that 
led to a consent decree allowing him to keep full medical privileges 
over the initial objections of the cook county board 
he died of aids complications may 25 and in accordance with his 
wishes no services were scheduled the chicago tribune reported 
saturday 
he never wavered not for a moment in his commitment to pursue 
full remedy and reinstatement consistent with good medical 
practice said harvey grossman his lawyer and legal director of 
the illinois chapter of the american civil liberties union 
he understood on many levels what the issues were for 
aidsinfected people like himself grossman said as a doctor 
he knew both the facts of transmission and the implications of not 
continuing to participate in society 
in february 1987 the cook county board voted to deny bouffard 
medical privileges at the county hospital out of fear he might 
contaminate patients the hospitals executive medical staff voted 
to reinstate him and the case went to court 
on feb 24 1988 a consent decree issued by a federal court in 
chicago restored all his medical privileges while requiring him to 
wear double gloves for certain procedures 
his efforts were on behalf of the rights of all people who have 
the aidscausing virus to continue as productive members of society 
grossman said 
he was a very courageous man the lawyer added 
bouffard received the 1988 civil liberties award of the aclu of 
illinois in a private ceremony several weeks ago 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the bodys 
defenses against disease leaving a person prey to lifethreatening 
infections and certain cancers 
the virus that causes the incurable and fatal syndrome is 
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse shared 
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants before 
or during birth 
a coworker dr james stone described bouffard as a free 
thinker who kept his private life to himself 
he worked hard and came in early stone said he was cook 
countys expert on brain wave analysis and nervemuscle diseases

drug testing of detroits 5000member police 
force was ordered stopped at least temporarily by a federal judge 
who said hes not convinced the department has a widespread drug 
problem 
us district judge horace gilmore ordered friday that the 
testing be halted until a hearing can be held to determine the 
merits of the practice 
the ruling came after the american civil liberties union filed 
suit on behalf of 70 city employees seeking to stop the testing 
which has been conducted on about 1000 officers since it began may 
26 
its ironic that out of the first 1000 officers tested the 
department said none tested positive for drugs said william 
werthheimer jr an attorney for the aclu thats not consistent 
with a departmentwide problem 
the judge said his decision was based on a federal appeals court 
ruling last month in a case from chattanooga tenn the appeals 
court said that unless there is evidence of a widespread drug 
problem in a police department mass testing violates fourth 
amendments ban on unreasonable searches 
detroit police department spokesman fred zaharoff said the 
department would abide by the decision but declined further comment 
the injunction granted by gilmore prohibits the testing until 5 
pm tuesday by which time the parties expect to hold a hearing on 
the merits of the tests 
the detroit police department has been rocked recently by 
suspensions of 14 officers for drug use and reports that an 
additional 100 officers are under investigation for crack cocaine 
use or other crackrelated crimes 
under detroits drug testing program police officers who test 
positive for cocaine or heroin would be subject to firing after a 
fourstep retesting process officers testing positive for marijuana 
could remain on the force after a suspension and education program

president reagan shed a symbolic burden at the 
moscow summit that he had carried for five years his own 
description of the kremlin as an evil empire 
it was a remark that reagan had uttered only once but it had 
burned in the soviet consciousness since 1983 an oftquoted and 
inescapable reminder of superpower tensions finally to the private 
delight of white house officials it was gone 
that was a different time a different era reagan said 
standing on the cobblestones of red square alongside mikhail s 
gorbachev the architect of ambitious social and economic changes 
that the united states wants to encourage 
reagans repudiation bolstered the alreadyimproved ties between 
the united states and soviet union and cleared the stage for another 
president to move in next january to manage superpower relations 
unfettered by the rhetorical extremes of his predecessor 
gorbachev took immense satisfaction in reagans retraction he 
quoted a greek philosopher as saying everything flows everything 
changes 
indeed the word change is an understatement for what has 
happened in the remarkable 30month summit relationship of reagan 
and gorbachev 
the two superpowers owners of the worlds deadliest arsenals of 
nuclear weapons have made a dramatic leap from open hostility and 
isolation to warmth and frequent contacts at the highest level 
make no mistake there still are deep differences the 
superpowers are deadlocked over terms of a strategic arms reduction 
treaty start and gorbachev bridled at reagans lectures about 
human rights in the soviet union 
the soviet leader said that the kremlin will not accept any 
advice on how to run our affairs we do not need anyone elses 
model we do not need anyone elses values 
yet things are different 
since the first reagangorbachev meeting in 1985 superpower 
summitry has become so routine that white house officials are not 
embarrassed by the fact that the latest meeting did not produce any 
breakthroughs or concrete achievements 
we cant give you a superbowl game every couple of weeks or 
months said lt gen colin powell the presidents national 
security adviser 
we have to take this slowly this is too important to rush 
powell said in the next six months the next six years if you 
dont come home with a start treaty that the experts the 
congress dont see as strong itll never be ratified 
there is little likelihood a start treaty will be concluded under 
reagan 
with time running out on his administration the negotiators will 
not return to geneva until july 12 to resume negotiations 
we set no deadline reagan said you dont make a treaty 
just to simply have it be achieved at a certain point in time 
however powell talking with reporters on air force one as 
reagan flew back to washington said ussoviet relations now are 
solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs without too many 
sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety it is a fairly 
stable maturing growing relationship 
to underscore his point powell noted that secretary of state 
george p shultz has had something like 26 meetings with his soviet 
counterpart eduard shevardnadze 
in the absence of concrete achievements white house officials 
said reagans real accomplishments were his appearances before 
soviet students intellectuals dissidents writers and monks at the 
danilov monastery he argued for greater freedom for the soviet 
people and respect for human rights 
i submit to you that that is real substance powell said 
when you can take that kind of message directly to the people of 
the soviet union in the person of the president of the united 
states that goes well beyond form that goes well beyond style 
that is substance 
yevgeny yevtushenko a wellknown soviet poet emphasized the 
symbolic importance of reagans appearances 
mr reagan doesnt belong to the kind of intellectual elite he 
represents the ordinary american people he speaks for the silent 
majority yevtushenko said in moscow last week 
if he takes the first step into the kremlin it was the 
socalled american people they made the step too yevtushenko 
said 
the summit appeared to be an exhausting experience for the 
77yearold reagan 
he acknowledged he returned home tired but said he was 
exhilarated the events of this week in moscow were momentous not 
conclusive perhaps but momentous reagan said 
reagan who refused to meet with gorbachevs three predecessors 
attributed most of the evolution in ussoviet relations to 
gorbachev a leader who the president said is a serious man 
seeking serious reform 
reagan also said in a speech in london that the west should 
embrace honest change when it occurs but let us also be wary and 
ever vigilant 
that responsibility soon will be passed to democrat michael 
dukakis or republican george bush whoever wins the presidential 
election in november 
i think its a relationship that will be built on by the next 
administration regardless of which party wins the election 
powell said 
he said that moscow will continue working actively with reagan 
but at the same time it would be not smart of them not to begin 
thinking about the next administration it also would be not awfully 
responsible of us not to begin preparing them for the next president 
as we get later into the year powell said well start to 
do our own transition activities to the next president to make 
sure that this relationship this transition occurs in a smooth 
satisfactory way

the debate in the united states over legalization 
of drugs is having little impact in western europe most governments 
on this side of the atlantic favor even tougher drug laws despite 
claims that severity only aggravates the problem 
support for legalizing drugs appears confined to certain european 
law enforcment officers and drugrehabilitation workers who argue 
that harsh laws encourage crime help spread aids and do little to 
cure addicts 
just two years after the european parliament narrowly rejected a 
proposal to legalize marijuana no government or major political 
party in europe is calling for legalized drugs 
in norway there is massive and unambiguous support in the 
parliament in the administration and in the population for our 
official hardline policy said ketil bentzen the governments 
adviser on drugs 
a politician who would bring up legalization of drugs would at 
once be politically dead bentzen said 
a 1986 report by the european parliament said heroin abuse has 
become an epidemic of serious proportions since the mid1970s 
and it estimated that there were 15 million heroin addicts in the 
12nation european economic community 
the rapidity with which hard drugs particularly heroin have 
taken hold on all western european nations is alarming the report 
said it predicted a similar explosion in cocaine use 
the parliament concluded that relaxed drug laws would encourage 
more addiction it urged greater cooperation among lawenforcement 
agencies in tracking down drug suppliers and smugglers 
the debate over decriminalization seems to be gaining momentum 
from a campaign for repeal of drug laws in the united states where 
several congressmen and mayors have suggested that the war on drugs 
is a losing battle 
for example the paris weekly journal du dimanche published 
reader reaction to an article by baltimore mayor kurt schmoke in the 
international herald tribune schmoke has proposed congressional 
hearings on whether decriminalizing narcotics can reduce 
drugrelated crime 
the french newspaper found few in favor of relaxing the countrys 
drug laws 
but it quoted georges asap prosecutor in the southeastern city 
of valence as saying in less than five years the 
decriminalization of all drugs will be a reality simply because one 
cant do otherwise its been 30 years now ive been putting people 
in prison for using or selling drugs knowing all along it served no 
purpose 
because of its relaxed attitude toward drugs the netherlands has 
become a haven for foreign addicts especially those from west 
germany and italy 
amsterdam alone has an estimated 7000 junkies and drug abuse has 
become so entrenched that a bus circulates through the capital 
distributing free methadone addicts have their own union 
although police turn a blind eye to marijuana authorities are 
reluctant to legalize drugs outright 
utrechts police commissioner jan wiarda argues that legalizing 
drugs would reduce crime but says the netherlands could not take 
such a step unless neighboring countries did the same 
last year the european movement for the normalization of drug 
policy was set up in the dutch city of rotterdam to muster support 
for legalized drugs it now has representatives in 10 countries 
the groups british representative is dr russell newcombe a 
researcher for the regional drug training and information center in 
the northwest port city of liverpool which has one of britains 
worst drug problems 
newcombe said in an interview that the group wants first to 
remove penalties for possession it ultimately hopes to persuade 
governments to ration supplies to addicts 
we have patiently failed in our efforts over the past two 
decades to prevent the use of illegal drugs newcombe said more 
importantly we have failed to prevent the kinds of problems illegal 
drugs can lead to problems like aids and crime are not due to 
drugs but to the fact that drugs are illegal and users are driven 
underground 
but governments have kept cracking down for example 
the swedish parliament passed a bill may 19 outlawing not just 
drug possession but drug use 
the british parliament passed a law in 1986 empowering police 
and courts to confiscate drug profits and increasing the maximum 
penalty for trafficking from 14 years to life imprisonment 
norway doubled the maximum penalty for drugs offenses to 20 
years in 1984 
there also appears to be strong support for repealing italys 
1975 law exempting from prosecution possession of small amounts of 
drugs for personal use 
greek drug rehabilitation centers also are campaigning to make 
the countrys already tough laws even tougher 
we have fought many trends that call for looser drug laws 
said kalliopi boudouroglou a member of the panhellenic coordinating 
committee against narcotics legalization isnt even being 
considered

this city has been a pacesetter in crime since 
the machinegun days of al capone and john dillinger but so far it 
has oddly missed out on crack the devastating new form of cocaine 
the crystalline or granular form of the narcotic available in 
small doses at bargainbasement prices is wreaking havoc in new 
york los angeles miami detroit and other cities 
but not in chicago 
cocaine without a doubt is our no 1 priority seventyfive 
percent of our cases in the last fiscal year were cocainerelated 
said spokesman fran hirzy at the local office of the us drug 
enforcement administration 
but crack its not here 
commander john r ryle of the police departments narcotics 
division agrees 
weve not been able to purchase any or even raid a crack house 
certainly its unusual ryle said 
theories abound as to why a city flush with contraband has so far 
escaped one of the nations biggest urban nightmares 
perhaps its the adverse publicity about what this stuff can do 
to you its the most dangerous addiction on the street hirzy 
said 
and the gangs who control much of the citys drug trafficking can 
be curiously conservative said sociologist hugh horan at the 
university of illinoischicago school of public health 
they may simply not want to diversify from cocaine in powder 
form horan said 
on the west side police sgt gene connelly of the gangnarcotics 
unit deals with the notorious vice lords gang whose members number 
in the thousands 
their primary enterprise is peddling narcotics mostly cocaine 
but not crack 
from january 1 to may 1 we conducted 566 raids we have yet to 
come across crack connelly said for the year of 1987 we had 
1628 raids and did not come across it 
youd think somehow out of all the raids either with a search 
warrant on a house or a simple stop on the street wed find it but 
we havent come up with one piece of crack 
i talk to cops with other towns and they think its coming from 
here i tell them we aint got it 
city gangs are involved in street sales of marijuana cocaine 
pcp and heroin but ryle said crack makes up maybe less than 1 
percent of all cocaine received by the police department 
crack has appeared on us police blotters since 1981 according 
to the dea 
popular in the inner cities because it can be bought in small 
quantities for as little as 5 crack is smoked and can take effect 
in 10 seconds much faster than cocaine in powder form which is 
snorted 
but a 22page dea internal report on crack published earlier 
this year said of chicago 
no cases are currently under investigation or being developed 
as no serious crack problem exists in this city 
us attorney anton valukas says the lull may be temporary 
noting that cocaine ports like new york miami and los angeles are 
flooded with the drug 
and when something like this hits the coasts we usually follow 
the trend valukas said 
but crack already is a problem of staggering proportions in 
another midwest city detroit a long way from either ocean has an 
estimated 1000 crack houses 
illegal drugs are readily available here in the nations 
thirdlargest city a transportation hub and key distribution point 
for goods of all kinds 
in february federal agents at ohare international airport found 
165 pounds of heroin worth 18 billion hidden in religious statues 
from thailand 
on may 24 police and federal drug agents confiscated 247 pounds 
of brown heroin the largest single seizure in us history 
last july attorney general edwin meese iii told reporters the 
government had seized 2 tons of cocaine at a fruit market after 
tracking it from florida

even before salvadoran president jose napoleon 
duarte learned he was suffering from cancer the reagan 
administration was concerned that the special relationship it had 
forged with el savador under duartes leadership could begin to wane 
duarte has been a favorite of republicans and democrats alike in 
the congress and since his election four years ago el salvador has 
received 15 billion in us economic aid and 455 million in 
military aid levels unmatched elsewhere in latin america 
but duartes christian democratic party is deeply split raising 
the clear possibility that victory in the 1989 presidential 
elections may go to the rightist arena party which made a strong 
showing in legislative elections last march 
many in congress are wary of arena because of the partys reputed 
links to death squad activities and there is some doubt among state 
department officials about whether the lawmakers will be as generous 
with an arenarun government as they have with duarte at the helm 
duarte was already a lame duck president when according to us 
officials he learned that the cancer which has affected his liver 
and stomach is terminal 
the only question is how long he will live said one 
official adding that his survival may only be a matter of months 
spokesmen at walter reed army hospital where duarte has been 
confined since wednesday have discussed duartes condition only in 
general terms 
according to a state department official duartes illness has 
prompted discussions among salvadoran officials about the 
possibility of duartes resigning 
arena soon will begin laying the groundwork for an effort to 
portray the party as a moderate force in salvadoran politics that 
contrasts with the unsavory image it has among many in congress 
the partys nominee for president is alfredo cristiani a 
useducated businessmen who is widely admired by us diplomats 
he will visit washington june 2024 partly in hopes of convincing 
members of congress that arena much like the major us parties 
believes in democracy free enterprise and anticommunism 
but the close ties the united states currently has with el 
salvador could suffer a setback if in the event of an arena 
victory cristiani emerges merely as a front man for another party 
chieftain roberto daubuisson 
daubuisson a former military officer and a founder of arena 
was once characterized by former us ambassador robert white as a 
pathological killer 
but cristiani should be able to win backing from the us 
congress if he is perceived to be in control of the government 
according to officials 
continued us support for el salvador is considered crucial if 
the fledgling democratic system there is to survive the challenge of 
a determined leftist insurgency 
much of the us strategy in central america is based on the 
importance of preventing a guerrilla victory in el salvador and it 
was only with duartes 1984 victory that congress was able to 
embrace the administration strategy 
he is seen here not only as a man with impeccable democratic 
credentials but also as perhaps the most proamerican president in 
latin america once during a white house welcoming ceremony he 
kissed an american flag 
duartes tenure has been marked by both great achievement as well 
as tragedy and disappointment he has worked hard to create a 
democratic climate in el salvador and has shown himself to be 
willing to make and carry out decisions that are unpopular with the 
military 
although there has been an increase recently in politically 
motivated killings the figures are only a fraction of what they 
were when the civil war started eight years ago 
but duartes quasisocialistic policies have enraged the business 
sector and us officials say he is partly to blame for the 
countrys unimpressive economic performance in recent years 
the rebel movement has survived the large infusions of us 
military aid and it appears to be prepared to continue its struggle 
for years it recently promised to increase its activities 
duartes tenure also has been marked by tragedy a daughter was 
kidnaped for 44 days early in duartes term and a 1986 earthquake 
in san salvador caused widespread suffering he now faces a 
different type of challenge 
after tests on thursday to determine the extent of his cancer 
duarte told reporters one thing is assured ill fight it out 
because i believe in god

three suspects arrested for selling drugs in an 
apartment building were each carrying crack each was carrying a 
loaded pistol 
none was older than 15 
they were hardnosed police inspector philip sheridan 
recalled they were actually berating us for arresting them 
surrounded by the drug trade and the violence it breeds some of 
new york citys children tote guns as casually as others carry 
school books or baseball gloves 
in brooklyns crown heights a poor neighborhood a halfhour 
subway ride from midtown manhattan kids act like they have a 
license to carry guns said the rev hardy smallwood jr a 
community leader 
he said parents are increasingly afraid of their own children 
and the cause is clear its all crack thats what its all 
about he said its a neverending battle 
before the rise of crack a potent inexpensive form of cocaine 
we never had this amount of violence said sheridan who has 
arrested boys as young as 12 in crown heights carrying 25caliber 
automatic pistols 
the citys schools have been focal points of the new juvenile 
violence following a recent rash of attacks on teachers the 
president of the citys teachers union demanded better schoolhouse 
security 
during the 198687 school year 1495 weapons ranging from 
crossbows and martial arts weapons to zip guns and pistols were 
taken from students 
this year the number of weapons taken from students is up about 
10 percent 1579 from the start of the school year to april 30 
and in the last six months there have been at least a dozen 
incidents in which students were injured by gunfire 
the problem is forcing educators to suggest remedies that once 
seemed extreme under sweeping new security procedures announced 
tuesday by mayor edward i koch and schools chancellor richard r 
green students who attack school workers would be expelled 
despite the states compulsory education law 
metal detectors are going up at the doors of some schools and 
additional police patrols will guard the most crimeridden schools 
putting in a metal detector alters the image of the school 
said bruce irushalmi director of the board of educations office of 
school safety but he added so do weapons 
irushalmi and ed muir head of the united federation of teachers 
safety committee link the increase in weapons to an increase in 
student drug trafficking 
children largely immune to harsh court punishment have been 
used by drug gangs for years to steer customers watch for the 
police or work as couriers 
in innercity neighborhoods with few good jobs teenagers can 
easily earn in a day or two what many adults make in a week 
the amount of money made in these lowerlevel organizations is 
just incredible said robert strang a spokesman for the federal 
drug enforcement administrations new york office 
for example an 11000 kilogram of cocaine can be processed into 
250000 worth of crack said william hopkins supervisor of the 
street research unit of the state division of substance abuse 
services 
police say drug rings increasingly are hiring children mostly 
boys in their early teens to market their wares 
to guard their investment dealers pass out pistols frequently 
small inexpensive 25caliber automatics called pea shooters by 
drug dealers whose own weapon of choice is the powerful 9mm 
automatic 
if a kid is hired to sell crack off the corner he might get 
ripped off said sheridan its a lot cheaper to give a kid a 
gun than to lose your drugs 
with 35 vials of crack selling for 8 to 10 youre putting 
350 worth of drugs in the hands of a 13yearold and hes very 
vulnerable he said so the dealers will give them a gun to 
protect their interests 
sheridan tries to make sense of what he sees each day on ghetto 
streets 
theres a great frustration with our young people today he 
said the lifestyles that are presented to them the guy with the 
gold chain the guys with the bmws these are the people they 
emulate

six miners were pulled alive from a 
mine shaft today three days after an explosion trapped them in a 
pocket of air deep underground rescuers who had given up hope 
said there may be more survivors 
its a miracle said petercarl ruehland a spokesman for 
preussen elektra the company that owns the mine the rescue came 
with the help of a television crews microphone that picked up 
tapping sounds 
in all 57 miners were trapped in wednesdays explosion at the 
stolzenbach coal mine as of early today 15 men were still missing 
and 36 had been confirmed dead 
the dramatic rescue sparked hopes for finding more survivors 
officials said there were some indications that two more men may be 
near the pocket of air more than 300 feet underground where the six 
spent 65 hours 
its a faint hope but a supervisor said there were tracks of 
two people who may also be in an area where they may have 
survived said heinz cramer a board member of preussen elektra 
were stepping up the search 
he said about 200 workers were involved in the search in the town 
of borken 72 miles northeast of frankfurt 
rescue workers some with tears in their eyes broke into 
applause as the exhausted but otherwise unhurt survivors were 
brought to the surface in a special cage that had been lowered into 
a shaft by a crane 
where is my ahmet where is my little ahmet were the first 
words of supervisor thomas gepperth as he emerged 
he was asking about ahmet batkan a turkish immigrant worker who 
was lifted out before him 
gepperth who led the turk and the five germans men to safety 
was the only one to walk rather than be carried on a stretcher 
everybody was making their last wills and testaments 
gepperth said i told them they didnt have to 
gepperth was interviewed by hesse state television as he strode 
to join his men his brief remarks taped early today were 
broadcast later in the day 
family members rushed to embrace the men whose blackened faces 
showed fatigue they were put on stretchers and carried to a nearby 
rescue station in the mine 
as they were led in an ambulance to be examined by doctors at a 
nearby hospitals the miners waved and smiled wearily officials 
said all six were later released and allowed to go home 
the six men were found in a deadend tunnel about 330 feet long 
10 feet wide and 8 feet high 
cramer said that when the group felt the shock wave of the blast 
wednesday they ran toward an exit but gepperth a veteran 
36yearold miner and a trained rescuer realized they were running 
into high concentrations of deadly carbon monoxide when he saw 
another man stagger and run out of strength 
gepperth then turned the group in the other direction and 
instructed them to be as calm as possible to conserve oxygen cramer 
said 
to the right and to the left of where they were the levels of 
carbon monoxide were rising ruehland said 
the rescue came early today after work crews drilled an air shaft 
in the north section of the mine where officials believed most of 
the remaining men were trapped 
the rescuers planned to release carbon monoxide to facilitate the 
search and were surprised when oxygen came out instead 
a cord was extended to 230 feet and a microphone was carefully 
lowered in by rescue workers it picked up distinct regular tapping 
sounds 
the microphone also picked up voices for a brief period but they 
later disappeared according to a description provided by hesse 
state radio and television 
after more than three hours of digging the rescue workers broke 
into the air pocket and found the men 
a man who identified himself as a brotherinlaw of rescued miner 
egon dehn told reporters at the scene that the survivors were 
between 21 and 37 years old and belonged to a 15man crew 
quoting dehn the man told reporters that after the explosion 
nine of the 15 tried to retrace their steps to reach safety but the 
other six went in an opposite direction and found an air pocket 
in addition to dehn gepperth and batkan a company spokesman 
identified the survivors as helmut gesner heinz roese and wilfried 
doench 
rescue workers and state officials said on thursday that they 
believed no one could survive the high levels of poisonous carbon 
monoxide gas inside the shaft 
wednesdays methane gas explosion rocked the ground like an 
earthquake the blast was west germanys worst mining disaster in 26 
years 
many of the miners whose bodies have been retrieved suffocated 
from lack of air after their emergency breathing masks ran out of 
oxygen while others died from their injuries officials said 
the blast killed about onethird of the work force at the 
preussen elektra mine the company is the leading employer in borken 
and one of west germanys largest utilities 
ruehland said the company would pay funeral costs and the costs 
of flying the immigrant workers bodies back to turkey if family 
members requested it fourteen of the 57 trapped miners were turkish 
the borken explosion is the worst west german mining accident 
since 299 men died in 1962 at the luisenthal mine in saarland state 
along the border with france

president reagans moves to ease tension in 
ussoviet relations could backfire politically because voters not 
worried about foreign affairs might end up backing democrats two 
scholars said saturday 
democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis could gain 
more from improved us soviet relations than vice president george 
bush the allbutcertain republican presidential nominee the 
scholars said 
but if that happens it would be only the second time since 1952 
that the foreign policy issue has played into the hands of the 
democrats william a galston and christopher j makins wrote in the 
lead article in the summer issue of foreign policy magazine 
the other campaign was in 1964 when lyndon b johnson 
steamrollered barry goldwater in part with a famous daisypetal 
advertisement and moscow calling line portraying the 
conservative republican as a warmongerer 
galston is a democrat who was issues director for walter mondale 
from 1982 to 1984 and who worked briefly as an adviser to sen 
albert gore jr dtenn when gore sought the democratic 
nomination makins is an independent and former director of 
international security programs for the roosevelt center for 
american policy studies galston is also a former roosevelt center 
scholar 
the history of modern presidential elections suggests that the 
republican candidate will be well advised to stress foreign policy 
while his democratic counterpart should seek to focus public 
attention on domestic concerns they wrote 
concerns about ussoviet relations and arms control have 
receded in the face of the dramatically improved atmosphere and the 
solid progress at the negotiating table the public is now more 
worried about terrorism the spread of nuclear weapons to countries 
that do not now have them possible conflict in the persian gulf 
and the us trade imbalance they said demands for better 
burden sharing with western europe and japan have become staples of 
the 1988 campaign rhetoric 
if the foreign policy debate focuses on these issues democrats 
may have an opportunity to offset the advantage republicans have 
enjoyed on more traditional foreign policy issues 
opinion polls and scholarly studies have concluded that american 
voters are swayed less by foreign policy concerns than by domestic 
issues especially the state of the economy 
but galston and makins said foreign policy can be crucial at 
the margin where it counts the most 
foreign policy is first and foremost a prism through which 
voters judge the basic soundness of a candidate to govern the 
country they said 
even though the irancontra affair weakened public confidence in 
the republicans stewardship of foreign affairs polls still give 
the republicans an edge in this arena the authors said 
the article says both bush and dukakis could be saddled with 
party platforms that turn voters off 
in 1984 archconservative forces seized control of the 
republican platform process and drafted a document not entirely to 
the white houses liking especially with its allusions to fighting 
and winning nuclear wars it said 
the democrats face the prospect that jesse jackson and his 
supporters will fight for platform stands on military spending arms 
control and the middle east that might well antagonize swing 
voters whose support will be critical to democratic general election 
prospects 
in 1984 the article notes three of the five contested 
democratic platform planks dealt with foreign policy issues 
jacksonsponsored minority reports on defense spending cuts and a 
nuclear nofirst policy and a gary hart push for stringent limits 
on committing us troops to combat 
the picture that emerged was of a liberal party significantly 
divided on foreign policy and at risk of being tugged even further 
to the left the article said 
dukakis the massachusetts governor with no foreign policy 
experience has faithfully represented the views of postvienam 
democrats who are skittish about the use of american force opposed 
to much of this decades military buildup it said 
such a stance has not fared well among conservative democrats 
and independents in past general elections the authors said 
bush former cia director and envoy to china may be able to 
argue that reagans military buildup and strategic defense 
initiative have brought the soviets back to the bargaining table and 
dissuaded the ussr from advancing in the third world 
but bushs ties to reagan also leave him in a relatively weak 
position to exploit the electorates frustration over trade the 
international drug trade the us decline overseas and the 
allies perceived failure to contribute fairly to the common 
defense it said

a police dog with eye cancer whose supporters 
raised 5000 when the city refused to pay for his surgery has come 
through the operation so well he may be able to return to active 
duty police said 
zeus a 7yearold german shepherd returned home friday with his 
handler officer mike kendig one day after undergoing surgery to 
remove the cancerous eye at a sacramento calif animal hospital 
he has been fitted with a temporary prosthesis and will go back 
to sacramento next month to be fitted with a permanent one said 
sgt greg dion a police spokesman 
meanwhile zeus will return to training in about three weeks to 
determine whether his other senses will compensate enough for the 
loss of the eye to let him return to fulltime police work dion 
said 
zeus became a celebrity when it was reported the city would not 
pay for the operation because he was taking early retirement that 
spurred a fundraising effort that netted more than 1000 in a few 
hours and has reached nearly 5000 according to police capt jim 
weston 
the city has since announced it will foot the entire 1400 cost 
of zeus operation and the prosthesis the donations will be 
refunded if people ask for their money back the rest will be put in 
a city fund earmarked for police dogs

president reagan on saturday renewed a grant of 
favorable trade status to china and hungary but allowed similar 
status for romania to lapse 
the presidents action continues in effect for 12 months a waiver 
granted to the chinese and hungarian governments under legislation 
passed in 1974 the legislation conditions most favored nation 
status on satisfactory immigration policies 
reagan said that he was permitting the waiver for romania to 
expire because romania has renounced extension of the socalled 
most favored nation tariff treatment under the act 
he said that the waivers have made it possible to maintain 
bilateral trade agreements with the three countries and give us 
companies the ability to compete in those countries markets 
hungary has continued to take a relatively positive and 
constructive approach to emigration matters the president said 
and china has a relatively liberal policy on emigration 
reflected in the steadily rising number of immigrant visas issued by 
our embassy and consulates in china

the story of panos dukakis and euterpe boukis 
is a classic tale of immigrants a saga of poor greeks who landed in 
america with nothing and achieved through sheer effort a piece of 
the dream 
michael dukakis has carefully cultivated his image as an 
immigrant son during his democratic presidential campaign an ethnic 
portrayal rarely seen in his earlier days in public life 
seventyfive years ago a young greek man arrived in manchester 
from a town in western asia minor he spoke very little english and 
had about 25 in his pocket dukakis recalls on the stump 
panos his father worked in the mills and put himself through 
college he went on to harvard medical school a rare educational 
leap for an immigrant and became a wealthy obstetrician euterpe 
his mother arrived here at the age of 9 toiled in the textile 
factories and became the first girl in her hometown to go to college 
dukakis is rightfully proud of his family telling the story with 
equal parts love pride and political acumen it is a tale certain 
to strike a chord with meltingpot americans 
but critics say the governor never mentioned his ethnic roots 
during the prepresidential years and turned to them now only as a 
campaign tactic to attract ethnic voters as well as build a huge 
fundraising base from the greek community 
i dont remember him ever mentioning it and i was listening 
pretty carefully said former massachusetts gov francis sargent 
a liberal republican who lost the 1974 election to dukakis i knew 
he was a greek but he didnt trumpet it 
although i think he was always aware and proud of his greek 
heritage it was not something that has ever been intimately 
connected with his politics said martin linsky of harvards john 
f kennedy school of government 
to many massachusetts voters dukakis was associated not with 
first and secondgeneration americans but with harvard academics 
and whitecollar suburban liberals he grew up in financial comfort 
graduated from harvard law school and made his name in politics in 
the 1960s as a leader of young politicians out to reform the state 
democratic party which was run largely by pols with a strong ethnic 
affiliation and his political base was brookline a predominately 
jewish uppermiddleclass boston suburb 
paul brountas longtime friend fellow greek and campaign 
chairman says dukakis ethnic emphasis helped identify him to a 
national audience that knew little of the massachusetts governor 
and helped him stand apart in the crowded democratic field in the 
early weeks of the campaign 
when youre running nationally and when people dont know who 
you are you have to identify yourself your values your 
background before you get into issues said brountas thats 
not necessary to run for governor he was very well known when he 
ran for governor 
brountas said the governors 1976 trip to his parents homeland 
was a turning point triggering deep feelings of ethnic pride 
it made an impact on him i remember one night in greece we 
were at a semiformal government dinner with several dignitaries 
brountas recalled he was asked to say a few words he was quite 
poignant emotional it was the first time id seen him talk about 
his heritage that way 
longtime dukakis observers say hints of the immigrant son began 
emerging publicly during his 1978 campaign which he lost to edward 
king and became more visible in 1982 as he successfully fought to 
win back the governorship 
a 1982 television advertisement which came to be known as the 
zorba the greek ad featured dukakis standing in front of a 
house his father lived in while saving money for school with 
traditional greek music playing in the background dukakis spoke 
about his fathers life 
what it did was give him a history said michael goldman a 
bostonbased democratic political consultant before that goldman 
said what did you know about michael dukakis he was from 
brookline and he went to harvard the perception was he was sort 
of a yankee 
dukakis focus on his heritage never played such a central role 
in his political life until his presidential bid 
hes never had to reach down that deep before said linsky 
its an internal thing its never been necessary before hes 
never had to draw on his own roots as a personal and emotional 
matter hes always been able to achieve what hes achieved without 
getting to that point running for president was a different 
operation 
dukakis greek ancestry helped him win votes on several fronts 
says ralph whitehead a professor at the university of massachusetts 
at amherst 
its helping him with ethnic voters and i think its regarded 
by many voters in the democratic party be them ethnic or otherwise 
as a sign that hes down to earth even if he isnt necessarily 
earthy whitehead said 
and whitehead added dukakis greek identity gives him all the 
advantages of the ellis island mystique and none of the 
disadvantages that have shadowed some italianamerican politicians 
in the eyes of the democratic electorate dukakis has almost 
the ideal form of ethnicity said whitehead dukakis has become 
sort of generically ethnic

the moscow summit ended with the superpowers far 
apart on a strategic arms reduction treaty and on an issue that will 
become more important in months to come cuts in conventional 
forces in europe 
although hopes dimmed for a new arms treaty under president 
reagan the news was not all bad 
both sides are still talking rather than shouting as they did 
early in the reagan administration and they are discussing more 
issues more seriously than ever before 
perhaps the most important development that the summit showed 
and the one that is hardest to measure is the growing role that 
domestic political developments in the soviet union are playing in 
superpower relations 
reagan who built his political career as a communist basher was 
impressed by the changes in soviet policy under mikhail s 
gorbachev whom he called a serious man seeking serious reform 
quite possibly we are beginning to take down the barriers of 
the postwar era quite possibly we are entering a new era in 
history a time of lasting change in the soviet union said 
reagan who early in his term branded the soviet union an evil 
empire 
within hours after reagan left moscow on friday gorbachev 
exhibited the harmonious summit in a political battle against 
domestic opponents of his campaign of perestroika to reform the 
soviet economy 
the kremlin leader fought off a conservative attempt at a moscow 
communist party executive committee meeting to block prominent 
reformers from attending an important national party conference 
starting june 28 
as gorbachev looked on one of his allies moscow party chief lev 
zaikov told opponents of reform that the summit marked a concrete 
result of perestroika in foreign policy 
the change in soviet political debate while nowhere near as open 
as the battles in the west has been accompanied by a shift in the 
nature of arms control negotiations the superpowers are now 
discussing deep cuts in new systems unlike agreements of the 1960s 
and 1970s which limited rather than reduced arsenals 
and the soviets for the first time are willing to allow 
americans to make onsite inspections to monitor compliance with the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf pact signed last december 
and ratified by the us senate last month 
reagan and gorbachev shook hands over the inf pact at the summit 
and ended five days of intensive talks by declaring some progress on 
two of five major obstacles to the strategic arms reduction treaty 
start to slash nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50 percent 
but they did not clear the major hurdle to start reagans 
strategic defense initiative plan for spacebased defenses and they 
reported no progress on soviet demands to limit the number of 
sealaunched cruise missiles or us demands that the soviets phase 
out their heavy ss18 missiles 
on conventional arms there was a subtle hint of motion 
a few hours after reagan arrived in moscow last sunday gorbachev 
proposed they exchange data on conventional forces to try to 
eliminate asymmetries in the opposing forces the warsaw pact 
has more forces and nato has more antitank guns 
a senior us official called gorbachevs presentation a 
restatement of past soviet ideas rather than a proposal 
he just sort of moved some commas around on a 1986 proposal 
for a 500000troop reduction in warsaw pact and nato forces in 
europe said the official speaking on condition that he not be 
identified 
us analysts said before the summit they anticipated gorbachev 
might announce unilateral cuts of 50000 to 100000 troops 
but one soviet spokesman rejected that 
i would not be in favor of the idea of a unilateral cut said 
sergei plekhanov deputy director of the institute for the 
usacanada we have been making a lot of concessions 
western politicians would like to see cuts in warsaw pact forces 
which they claim have an edge of 2to1 in tanks 
the soviet union has for the first time accepted the nato 
argument that the warsaw pact has more tanks but they argue that 
the west has more attack aircraft and other forces 
gorbachev has been proposing that the two sides exchange 
information about european forces but the americans insist that 
conventional force negotiations can only take place in a forum 
involving all the nations of nato and the warsaw pact 
thus the talks will be part of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe the successor to the helsinki negotiations 
that led the soviet union in 1975 to promise to observe human 
rights 
before his trip to moscow reagan had accused the kremlin of wide 
human rights abuses blocking progress on conventional arms but 
now that reagan has declared gorbachev sincere in his reforms the 
americans might be more inclined to enter into hard bargaining for 
conventional forces reductions 
toning down us criticism of human rights policy said a senior 
us official makes it a lot easier for gorbachev to change his 
policies 
and the west would like nothing better to see smaller 
conventional armies in europe and a better soviet record on human 
rights

the chinese government has announced new 
regulations restricting the lending of giant pandas to foreign zoos 
the official xinhua news agency said saturday 
the move comes in response to environmentalist claims that china 
is profiting from foreign exhibits of the endangered species 
the chinese association of zoological gardens ruled that only 
noncommercial exhibitions will be allowed and that no foreign 
companies will be allowed to profit from showing the animals xinhua 
said 
foreign zoos holding exhibitions will have to contribute funds or 
technical assistance to the association for protecting pandas and 
other rare animals it said foreign exhibitions must also be 
approved by the chinese government 
there are fewer than 1000 pandas living in the wild all in 
remote areas of southwest china about 60 pandas live in chinese 
zoos 
in recent years the association of zoological gardens has loaned 
pandas to zoos in north america europe and japan the zoos assured 
of increased revenues from the popular animals have paid china 
500000 and more for the right to borrow a panda pair 
the world wildlife fund and the american association of 
zoological parks and aquariums last month asked a us district 
court to halt shipment of two giant pandas who were to be put on 
display in toledo ohio as part of the citys 150th anniversary 
celebration 
the court rejected the suit 
the chinese association also announced tighter controls over the 
lending of golden monkeys another endangered species found in china

the french choose a new 577seat national assembly 
on sunday four weeks after reelecting president francois 
mitterrand and are expected to give his socialists a solid majority 
the tworound election also is expected to spell doom for the 
communists and the farright national front in the lower house of 
parliament where the legislative power lies 
mitterrand got 54 percent of the vote in the may 8 contest with 
former premier jacques chirac the conservative presidential 
candidate and polls indicate a crushing victory for his party in 
the assembly elections 
late surveys indicated the socialists would receive 4244 percent 
of the vote compared with about 40 percent for the alliance of the 
conservative rally for the republic and centerright union for 
french democracy because of the french election formula however 
that slim advantage could translate into majority of 100 seats or 
more 
legislative elections in 1986 used a oneround proportional 
system with seats assigned on the basis of the percentage of votes 
won by lists of candidates but under the current system the winner 
takes all 
candidates winning more than 50 percent of the vote sunday are 
elected 
in districts where no candidate achieves 50 percent a runoff 
will be held june 12 among those with 125 percent or more in the 
first round 
the new system favors large parties and hurts smaller ones in 
this case the national front and the communists each of which won 
35 seats the last time 
it appears certain both will fall well short of the 30 seats 
needed to qualify as an official political group in the assembly 
that is important because committee memberships speaking time time 
on radio and television and other matters are decided on the basis 
of political groups 
conservatives controlled the national assembly from 1986 until 
mitterrand dissolved it after his reelection last month they seem 
to have accepted a return to opposition while the socialists appear 
almost apologetic about their commanding position 
mitterrand said during his presidential campaign he wanted to 
work with the existing national assembly and open the cabinet to 
nonsocialists from the political center 
new premier michel rocard formed a government with no notable 
presence from other parties however and mitterrand called the 
election 
socialists continued with the opening theme through the 
campaign but most politicians of the right and centerright view 
the idea as little more than an invitation for them to become 
socialist 
rocard said even a socialist landslide would not be fatal to the 
opening because we want to work with others 
jean lecanuet president of the union for french democracy had 
this unenthusiastic comment the socialists should make their 
policies known instead of talking ceaselessly of an opening which 
is a yawner 
the only concrete socialist plan made public so far is for a 
guaranteed minimum income to be financed in part by reviving the 
special tax on large fortunes the conservatives abolished it in 
1986 
pierre mehaignerie a centrist leader who was an early object of 
socialist overtures said in a final campaign plea experience has 
shown that we were more effective in creating jobs fighting 
unemployment and creating riches 
he contended that accepting the socialist opening would mean 
submission not constructive dialogue

president reagan said today his visit to moscow 
sowed seeds of freedom and greater trust that he believes will 
take root and grow in ways yet unguessed 
in his weekly radio address the president reviewed his summit 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev from which he returned 
on friday after a stopover in london 
appearing rested after his first night back in the white house 
reagan was seen walking from his residential quarters to the oval 
office in a jogging outfit 
noting recent soviet reforms the president said it is my hope 
that what took place in my moscow visit will lead to still greater 
individual freedom for peoples in the soviet union 
if anyone had suggested even as recently as 10 years ago that 
an american president would one day be able to meet with soviet 
dissidents inside moscow itself or be able to speak to soviet 
students in their own university about human freedom well i think 
youll agree that a prediction like that would have been 
dismissed reagan said 
but this past week it happened he added seeds of freedom 
and greater trust were sown and i just have to believe that in 
ways we may not even be able to guess those seeds will take root 
and grow 
believe me as far as nancy and i are concerned theres no 
place like home reagan declared to a flagwaving crowd that 
welcomed him friday to andrews air force base outside the capital 
air force one carrying the reagans from a postsummit stopover 
where they met leaders in london edged its nose into hangar 3 
where vice president george bush and most members of the cabinet 
were waiting 
amid the greetings an air force band blared a 21gun salvo rang 
out and a crowd on folding chairs and bleachers cheered 
were a little tired but were exhilarated at what has 
happened reagan said in an address from a raised platform in the 
center of the hangar exhilarated too at the thought of the 
future and what may lie ahead for the young people of america and 
all the world 
the events of this week in moscow were momentous not 
conclusive perhaps but momentous and believe me right now 
momentous will do just fine 
he repeated his assertion that real progress was made on arms 
control and human rights during his trip to moscow and talks with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
we made tangible progress toward an even more historic treaty 
on strategic weapons yes a 50 percent reduction in nuclear 
weapons reagan said 
the arrival rally was the final orchestrated event of more than 
a week of presidential travel that included reagans flight to 
helsinki finland for summit preparations last week his days and 
nights in moscow and his visit with britains prime minister 
margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth 
the state department meanwhile sent congress a report saying 
that although human rights in the soviet union and eastern european 
countries remained seriously flawed significant improvements 
were made in the six months ending april 1 
the soviet leadership improved the ability of citizens to express 
their views released some political prisoners increased emigration 
and made progress in reuniting families divided between the united 
states and the soviet union the report said 
on the other hand it said there appeared to be less tolerance 
of demonstrations elsewhere in eastern europe there also has ben a 
mixed bag of improvements and continued repression the report said 
as reagan flew back to washington his national security adviser 
lt gen colin powell said ussoviet relations are in good shape 
it is solidly in place without a lot of ups and downs without 
too many sharp turns that cause people to have anxiety powell 
told reporters on air force one 
it is a fairly stable maturing growing relationship and i 
think its a relationship that will be built on by the next 
administration regardless of which party wins the election in the 
fall he added 
though the superpowers still have major differences on terms of a 
strategic arms reduction treaty powell said we have to take this 
slowly this is too important to rush 
mrs thatcher said friday in an interview with the british 
broadcasting corp that she believed gorbachev would persist in 
trying to reform the soviet system 
i do get this feeling from mr gorbachev hes not going to be 
offput by the difficulties she said he has a vision of the 
possibilities and the opportunities and hes going to go through 
with it 
british opposition labor party leader neil kinnock who advocates 
unilateral disarmament and who describes mrs thatcher as reagans 
poodle praised reagan in an independent television news interview 
he deserves very full credit from our generation and from 
future generations for making a positive response to gorbachevs 
initiatives kinnock said 
white house aide mark rosenker said 4000 invitations to the 
welcomehome ceremonies were sent to members of the republican 
national committee congress appointed officials in the executive 
branch and military personnel in the washington area reporters 
estimated at least 3000 people showed up 
the white house arranged for more than two dozen 7th graders on a 
washington field trip from the drane middle school in corsicana 
texas to attend the arrival they made a noisy cheering section to 
the side of the podium 
welcoming signs including one that read another one for the 
gipper and one that said there you go again were distributed 
throughout the crowd 
except for attorney general edwin meese iii secretary of state 
george p shultz and defense secretary frank c carlucci all of 
whom were out of town the cabinet lined a red carpet leading from 
the plane to the podium to greet the reagans 
welcome home and well done bush said he lauded reagan for 
raising human rights issues in the heart of the kremlin 
whats wrong with telling the other guy how you feel bush 
said of reagans discussions with gorbachev

india may soon begin withdrawing some 
of the 50000 troops it sent to sri lanka over the past 10 months to 
enforce an indianbrokered peace accord press reports said saturday 
the united news of india quoted officials at the indian high 
commission or embassy in colombo as saying the withdrawal of the 
troops could begin as early as tuesday it did not identify the 
officials 
a report to be published sunday in the governmentowned sunday 
observer newspaper and made available to the associated press said 
the indian armys tank and artillery units will be withdrawn this 
week 
an independent sinhalese newspaper the sunday divaniya said 
that as many as 8000 indian troops may be pulled back from sri 
lanka starting early next week 
but nirupam sen deputy indian high commissioner in colombo told 
the ap that no time has been set for a pullout 
some equipment and troops that are not necessary will be sent 
back but we are still finalizing the exact time said sen 
indian defense minister kc pant told reporters during a visit 
tuesday that indian forces will begin withdrawing in the near 
future but he gave no specific date 
indian began sending troops to sri lanka on july 30 a day after 
indian prime minister rajiv gandhi and sri lankan president junius 
r jayewardene signed a peace accord aimed at ending a fiveyear 
insurgency by the islands minority tamils 
india is the dominant power in the region and its 60 million 
ethnic tamils are sympathetic to their sri lankan brethren

political autonomy or an independent homeland in the north and east 
of the island where most tamils live 
the accord called for the tamil rebels to lay down their arms in 
exchange for political concessions such as the creation of district 
councils with control over education law enforcement and land 
distribution all now handled by the federal government 
but the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the largest and most 
extreme of the rebel groups rejected the pact

rescuers pulled one gold miner to 
safety but there was little hope saturday of saving at least 27 
others buried when a maze of crudely dug tunnels and shafts caved in 
after heavy rains 
the survivor brought to the surface late friday was taken to a 
hospital in dipalog about 450 miles southeast of manila his left 
leg was so badly injured that doctors had to amputate it an 
official said the survivor was not identified 
benito tolentino mayor of the town of sibutad told reporters 
that the cavein occurred in a network of tunnels on the slopes of 
mount lablab after two days of heavy rain softened the soil 
he said 28 people were working in the area which is below a 
45footdeep shaft when the surface collapsed 
tolentino said rescuers in sibutad about 30 miles from dipalog 
were armed only with picks and shovels and were having difficulty 
reaching the trapped miners 
he said there was little hope that any of them were still alive 
tolentino ordered a temporary halt to any more gold prospecting 
at the site 
about 20000 prospectors from different parts of mindanao island 
have converged on the mountainside since gold was discovered last 
september tolentino said 
he said at least 12 people had been killed in previous caveins 
as in many other gold rush areas on mindanao prospectors 
often burrow into mountains without any professional supervision 
authorities in manila estimate that hundreds of people have been 
killed in such caveins with many of them unreported 
armed only with picks and shovels the miners dig deep into the 
earth and haul dirt out in bags other workers then sift gold 
nuggets and gold dust by washing off the dirt in streams using 
wooden pans

mikhail s gorbachev has emerged from his fourth 
superpower summit with little to show for it on paper but he 
appears to have persuaded a longtime adversary he is sincere in his 
pledge to build a new relationship with the west 
president reagan in what was most probably his last ussoviet 
summit took back his notorious characterization of the soviet union 
as an evil empire and heralded the beginning of a new era in 
history a time of lasting change in the soviet union 
though short on tangible achievement the latest talks between 
reagan and gorbachev produced a mood of good will and talk of mutual 
interest momentous reagan called it 
from their first meeting in 1985 came the spirit of geneva 
in which the two great nuclear powers took a tentative step toward 
each other after years of cold stares and bluster 
in reykjavik iceland the following year they rushed toward a 
disarmament pact finding agreement on broad statements of 
principle but the meeting collapsed in disappointment felt round 
the world when the two leaders hit an impasse over the future of 
star wars 
washington last december saw the triumphant signing of the 
first treaty to eliminate an entire class of nuclear weapons those 
borne by medium and shorterrange missiles and both sides looked 
forward to even greater achievement in moscow there both sides 
said they hoped the two leaders could sign an agreement to cut 
their longrange nuclear arsenals in half 
as at reykjavik however they stumbled again over star wars 
reagans visionary program to develop a spacebased defense against 
nuclear attack but this time neither side seemed particularly 
disappointed 
as he welcomed the american president to the kremlin gorbachev 
told reagan it is better to see once than to hear a hundred 
times and for reagan his first visit to the soviet union 
certainly was an eyeopener 
after building a political career on staunch anticommunism and 
opposition to practically every accord between the two superpowers 
reagan returned home convinced that the reforms gorbachev is trying 
to implement will change the character of the united states cold 
war enemy 
the events of this week in moscow were momentous he said 
not conclusive perhaps but momentous and believe me right now 
momentous will do just fine 
a senior american official who has watched the pitch and yaw of 
ussoviet relations for many years said reagans conversations 
with gorbachev appeared to break down the soviet leaders typically 
russian suspicion about his guests intentions 
he is more convinced not just intellectually but in the gut 
that the american people do not really represent a threat the 
official said of gorbachev 
reagan said that he found gorbachev different than previous 
soviet leaders as for the evil empire he said that was 
another time another era reagan used the term to describe the 
soviet union in march 1983 two years before gorbachev rose to power 
we must not stop here reagan said after his fourth and final 
day of summit talks 
and gorbachev told a news conference the same day that it is 
vitally necessary that superpower summitry continue albeit 
probably with the retiring presidents successor 
both sides seemed prepared to look beyond their problems with a 
new arms accord to continue building bridges for improved 
understanding 
let us look at one another with open eyes let us see each 
others history traditions and values gorbachev said let us 
respect each others choice respect our peoples 
reagan too sensed a change not just at the negotiating table 
but in national attitudes 
quite possibly we are beginning to take down the barriers of 
the postwar era he said quite possibly we are entering a new 
era in history a time of lasting change in the soviet union 
even on human rights issues which at one point appeared to 
threaten the cooperative spirit gorbachev appeared willing to seek 
new approaches and reagan muted his criticism by blaming the soviet 
bureaucracy for the slow pace of jewish emigration 
the american administration does not have an understanding of 
the real situation with human rights with the processes that are 
taking place in our country in the sphere of democracy the soviet 
leader told reporters probably we too do not have a clear 
understanding of the american situation in this sphere of life 
he said he suggested to reagan that the two nations hold a 
lawmakers seminar to exchange views on the subject 
he also praised his own countrys press for reporting on reagans 
meeting with dissidents and jews who have been refused permission to 
leave the country 
this part of the presidents visit had to be shown to our 
people he said the people should know everything 
because soviet television carried some of the summit events live 
the people did see and hear much more about american conduct and 
us policy than is normally available to them some even got a 
taste of western news programming when they discovered they could 
pick up cable news network broadcasts which were beamed into moscow 
for officials and journalists during the summit 
as for a new strategic arms reduction treaty reagans national 
security adviser lt gen colin powell indicated that is just a 
matter of time 
we have to take this slowly he said this is too important 
to rush 
in the meantime powell said the relationship between the united 
states and the soviet union is solidly in place without a lot of 
ups and downs without too many sharp turns that cause people to 
have anxiety 
it is a fairly stable maturing growing relationship he 
added and i think its a relationship that will be built on by 
the next administration regardless of which party wins the election 
in the fall 
gorbachev suggested that the real key to the future lies in 
developing economic ties between the two nations not just in 
formulating acceptable treaty language on reducing weaponry 
the more we depend on each other economically he said the 
more we will be predictable on the political plane

rainstorms saturday broke a heat wave 
that killed at least 450 people in new delhi and the northern states 
of rajasthan punjab and haryana in the past week 
the weather service said the temperature in the capital dropped

the soviet union made significant 
improvements in human rights in the past half year though the 
wellpublicized drive for freedom faltered on some fronts the state 
department said saturday in a major report to congress 
the department criticized what it called a crackdown on 
demonstrations complained that rights activists telephones were 
disconnected and said the governmentcontrolled press wrote 
distorted accounts of the protests 
rights performance in poland east germany romania and other 
east bloc countries was also a mixed bag of oldstyle repression and 
new progress according to the 137page document 
before being made public the report was distributed to members 
of congress friday as president reagan returned from the moscow 
summit but dissemination apparently was timed to meet a june 3 
deadline set by legislation calling for the report not to add 
substance to the human rights concerns expressed by reagan during 
his week of summitry 
after the united states signed the 1975 rights pact at the 
conference on security and cooperation in europe congress asked the 
department to report twice a year on whether the eastern europeans 
were complying with the bargain 
the result until soviet leader mikhail gorbachev arrived on the 
scene in 1985 has been a pile of reports filled with detailed 
distressing evaluations of the human condition in eastern europe 
including accusations of widespread failure to comply with pledges 
to grant freedom of assembly religion speech association 
emigration and travel 
the latest survey covering the six month period after oct 1 
1987 said although many aspects of soviet and east european 
implementation of csce commitments in the areas of human rights and 
economic cooperation remain seriously flawed there have been 
significant improvements in a number of areas 
on the positive side were increased emigration the release of 
some prisoners from labor camps relaxed rules on travel abroad by 
soviet citizens and best of all the report said the continued 
tolerance of unofficial groups and new freedom to publish tracts 
ranging from criticism of the government to george orwells animal 
farm 
the limits of what was permissible to print continued to 
expand and public discussion of problems became more frank the 
report said 
on the negative side soviet performance in the field of human 
rights deteriorated in some areas compared to the last reporting 
period the report said 
between 250 and 450 political or religious prisoners remain in 
jail and restrictions on religion continue 
the most detailed criticism touched on soviet handling of public 
protests 
the authorities cracked down on demonstrations taking 
extraordinary measures to prevent them or stop them as soon as they 
started the report said in another apparent retreat from 
previous progress soviet authorities disconnected the telephones of 
some human rights activists and selectively interfered with 
telephone service in order to prevent undesired conversations 
here are some highlights of the reports on other eastern european 
countries 
romania all freedoms remain sharply limited including 
romanias particular discrimination against ethnic minorities an 
amnesty declared by president nicolae ceausescu to honor his 70th 
birthday resulted in the release of an unprecedented number of 
prisoners 
poland the government continues to permit a relatively free 
intellectual life but during the reporting period authorities 
banned an independent discussion club in gdansk and harassed 
participants in independent political and union activities 
hungary the country continued to hold a reputation for being 
the least repressive of the warsaw pact countries an increase in 
contact between senior western visitors and the hungarian opposition 
was a notably positive development during the reporting period 
east germany all rights are limited but progress was seen in 
the increase of travel rights in allowed importation of some 
foreign literature and in a slight indication of better 
churchstate communication 
czechoslovakia the report on this country was as gloomy as 
ever repression of a march 25 civil rights demonstration in 
bratislava was the most serious known example of abuse 
bulgaria it remained a tightly controlled society despite an 
agreement with turkey to discuss human rights problems there 
appears to be no letup in discrimination against the turkish 
minority in bulgaria

a book about aids from a small gay publishing 
house is being offered free to the public this month at bookstores 
around the country in what one promoter hailed as a unique joint 
effort by the publishing industry 
the 126page volume titled you can do something about aids 
contains 35 short chapters written by such celebrities as elizabeth 
taylor whoopi goldberg and abigail van buren who writes dear 
abby 
it was published as a pro bono book with the help of 
publishing houses and companies like the bookofthemonth club 
random house bantam books simon and schuster and waldenbooks 
its absolutely unprecedented said rep gerry studds 
dmass who helped the book along by contacting some publishing 
companies nobodys been able to pull together the publishing 
industry like this before much less for a free book 
one group of authors concentrated on ways to get started in 
the effort to stop aids other sections deal with ways to fight 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and help victims of the disease 
a deadly crippling of the bodys immune system 
one of the most moving contributions is from olympic diving 
champion greg louganis who since 1984 has been a friend of 
17yearold aids victim ryan white of cicero ind who caught the 
disease from infected blood products he took for hemophilia 
louganis chapter is titled be a buddy and encourages people to 
make contact with aids victims and build friendships 
the thing i respect most about ryan is that someone in his 
position could be very angry or bitter but he isnt writes 
louganis in spite of his own difficulties hes trying to help 
others theres no reason to delay making contact and letting 
someone know you care 
you can do something about aids is the brainchild of 
36yearold sasha alyson the owner of alyson publications in 
boston he started his company 11 years ago 
inspiration for the project came from the grief of losing 35 
friends to aids he said 
i started making a list once about who had died and i just 
didnt want to finish it alyson said last week at first you 
think its going to go away or get better and it doesnt it gets 
worse 
during an interview at alyson publications in bostons south end 
alyson said he was naive when first planning the book last year 
i started out with all this confidence he said i thought 
people would think it was a great idea and would agree but i 
quickly found out that people quickly found ways to say no 
alyson said he initially encountered difficulty when contacting 
publishing companies and celebrities he made four attempts to reach 
elizabeth taylor before one of her assistants got word to her and 
she agreed to write an introduction to the book miss van buren 
first declined to contribute but then agreed he said 
i went from being very confident to rock bottom very quickly 
he said at one point i wanted to cancel the project 
even studds said he was skeptical about the project 
i was really touched by the idea but i had my doubts too that 
it would succeed he said 
alyson said he was consumed by the book all year now that it has 
become reality he hopes it will inspire the general public to join 
the effort to fight the aids epidemic 
the book will be most useful to those who didnt think aids 
would affect them but suddenly they realize its closer to home than 
they thought said alyson 
kathy weinkle who runs the buddenbrooks bookstore in boston with 
her brother martin said the response to you can do something 
about aids has been better than expected 
its doing phenomenally well she said we have to 
continuously refill the display almost everyone takes one people 
are making very positive comments

cathedrals in the nations oldest monastery will be 
returned to the russian orthodox church next week after 27 years of 
state ownership symbolizing progress in religious freedom 
officials announced saturday 
parts of the monastery of the caves have become museums and will 
remain in government hands the monastery was established in 1050 on 
the banks of the dneiper river in kiev capital of the ukraine 
where christianity arrived 1000 years ago in what now is the soviet 
union 
about 100 buildings are on the monastery grounds which are 
dotted with caves in which religious leaders and early princes of 
kiev were buried 
church and state officials made the announcement at the danilov 
monastery in moscow on the eve of weeklong festivities commemorating 
the christian millenium in this officially atheistic state 
ecumenical patriarch dimitrios spiritual leader of the worlds 
180 million eastern orthodox christians is boycotting the 
celebrations because of a dispute with the russian church over 
authority his headquarters are in istanbul turkey 
pope john paul ii is sending a vatican delegation led by his 
secretary of state cardinal agostino casaroli that includes nine 
other cardinals 
president reagan visited danilov last monday and urged the 
government to ease restrictions on religion 
metropolitan tikhon head of the monastery indicated some 
disappointment with reagans stop there he told a news conference 
the visit was intended as a peaceful friendly gesture but was 
short 
he only visited one temple tikhon said he delivered a 
speech he had no chance to meet many people so it is difficult to 
assess its impact 
reagan was in moscow for his fourth summit with mikhail s 
gorbachev the soviet leader 
since the bolshevik revolution of 1917 tens of thousands of 
churches have been destroyed or converted to government use and 
priests have been exiled or killed dictator josef stalin limited 
the activities of those houses of worship allowed to remain open 
about 90 million soviet people follow religious faiths however 
and the government is reconsidering its restrictions as a sign of 
the change it has participated in organizing celebrations of the 
millenium which begin sunday 
nationalization of the monastery of the caves in 1961 began a 
long period of protest by church leaders they raised the issue most 
recently in an april meeting with gorbachev 
metropolitan pitirim a ranking russian orthodox official told 
the danilov news conference friday the cathedrals at kiev will be 
returned to the church in a ceremony tuesday 
we are happy to be benefiting from this new climate in our 
country he told the associated press we hope this will develop 
and lead to the reopening of additional churches 
yuri shmirnov of the religion ministry said the decision was 
one of the most important we have made 
this is part of the governments reforms he told the ap 
you cannot exclude the church from real democratization this 
shows we are looking to the needs of the church

the italian government on saturday agreed to a nato 
request to accept 72 us fighter planes being evicted from spain 
defense minister valerio zanone said the government deemed it 
important that the planes remain in europe to protect the north 
atlantic treaty organizations southern flank he said moving them 
to italy was the only suitable solution to keeping the wing in 
service and avoiding an act of unilateral disarmament 
the united states under an accord reached in january with spain 
must remove the f16s from the torrejon air base near madrid by 
1991 the planes make up the us air forces 401st tactical fighter 
wing the pentagon has said it would have to disband the unit unless 
a final decision on moving them to another european base was made by 
august 
zanone said there was no reason for the concern over the transfer 
expressed by the warsaw pact since nato was only establishing a new 
peacetime base the f16s can carry nuclear weapons but zanone 
emphasized they will be armed only with conventional weapons 
warsaw pact countries are concerned that their territorial 
airspace could come within range of the aircraft when the planes are 
moved from spain to italy 
the italian government has reportedly been considering several 
sites in southern italy as possible bases for the f16s but zanone 
said no decision has been reached yet 
zanone said nato will meet the entire cost of relocating the 
planes estimated at about 500 million 
italys decision made at a cabinet meeting presided over by 
christian democrat premier ciriaco de mita had been expected 
following the formal request to italy by nato defense ministers in 
brussels on may 26 
at that time lord carrington the alliance secretarygeneral 
said the planes represent a considerable portion of our strength 
in the southern region 
italian government officials have said the transfer of the f16s 
would be examined by parliament later this month but that a vote 
would likely not be needed 
the communists italys secondlargest party immediately 
criticized the decision aldo tortorella a party leader denounced 
what he called the governments haste in deciding and its lack of 
national dignity 
but deputy premier gianni de michelis whose socialist party had 
previously expressed some doubts about the transfer told reporters 
that the decision was taken with the support of all coalition 
partners de mitas coalition of his christian democrats together 
with socialists republicans social democrats and liberals commands 
a comfortable majority in both houses of parliament 
de michelis said his party hoped that eastwest negotiations to 
reduce armaments would be successful and make the relocation 
unnecessary but that in the meantime italy should not take what 
amounted to an act of unilateral disarmament he and other 
politicians pointed to the us cruise missiles installed in comiso 
sicily which will now be removed as a result of the ussoviet 
treaty on mediumrange nuclear weapons

presbyterians should become more active in 
politics and should even consider civil disobedience to fight the 
spread of nuclear weapons a proposed statement of doctrine for the 
nations largest presbyterian denomination says 
the paper christian obedience in a nuclear age is expected 
to be the main topic of discussion this week as the 3 millionmember 
presbyterian church usa starts a yearlong bicentennial 
celebration with its 200th general assembly in st louis 
in addition to the peace paper the 630 commissioners or 
delegates will elect denominational officers and discuss a variety 
of other social and church issues the meeting opens tuesday with 
initial committee reports and an evening communion service and runs 
through june 15 
christian obedience in a nuclear age written last year by a 
task force of 17 theologians pastors and lay people is an attempt 
to answer conservatives criticism of an earlier study paper that 
took a stronger stand in favor of disobedience said the rev albert 
c winn who cochaired the task force 
this was our response to the charge that the first paper was 
producing warfare in the church and was going to divide the 
church winn said 
we were leaning over backwards to make clear that there is room 
in the church for disagreement he said 
the paper paints a picture of a world where children die of 
hunger while money goes to build more devastating more accurate 
more invulnerable smarter and cleaner weapons 
dissenters must think carefully before refusing to cooperate with 
government authority in such things as paying taxes to support the 
military the paper says but because of the extraordinary and 
unprecedented nature of the current situation cooperation with and 
obedience to duly constituted human authority should not be a matter 
of course 
the decision to cooperate should be as agonizing and as 
carefully undertaken as the decision to resist the paper says it 
called on presbyterians who opt not to resist authority to support 
those who do 
during the general assembly a committee will discuss the paper 
and report back to the full group the committees recommendation 
are tentatively scheduled to be presented june 14 the nexttolast 
day of the meeting 
the paper also recommended that the church and its members take a 
more active role in politics and the public media and that 
parents refuse to purchase war toys for children 
conservatives within the denomination had complained the earlier 
study paper titled presbyterians and peacemaking are we now 
called to resistance advocated tax resistance and civil 
disobedience to the exclusion of other methods of expression and 
some say the second report is not much better 
the only real change from the earlier paper is tactical 
said the rev paul f scotchmer executive director of presbyterians 
for democracy and religious freedom a conservative group instead 
of calling outright for all presbyterians to withhold war taxes 
and engage in other forms of resistance to the us government 
the new document merely asks the entire church to throw its support 
behind those who do 
the paper condemns the theory of nuclear deterrence that the 
existence of nuclear weapons helps prevent war because each side 
knows such a war would destroy it 
the moral case for nuclear deterrence even as an interim 
ethic has been undermined by unrelenting arms escalation the 
paper says 
having declared nuclear deterrence immoral we must exercise 
our individual corporate influence to effect a change in national 
policy as rapidly as possible 
the denomination was formed in 1983 through a merger of the 
united presbyterian church in the usa and the presbyterian church 
us the two bodies had split during the civil war 
the church has headquarters in both atlanta and new york but 
will move its general offices to louisville ky this summer

president reagan said saturday his moscow 
summit visit sowed seeds of freedom and greater trust that he 
hopes will lead to increased liberty for the soviet people 
i just have to believe that in ways we may not even be able to 
guess those seeds will take root and grow the president said in 
his weekly radio address from the oval office 
wearing a jogging outfit the president appeared relaxed and 
rested after his first night in the white house since he left may 25 
on his pilgrimage to helsinki finland moscow and london 
reagan also said that he and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
had moved ahead on negotiations that would lead to a dramatic 
reduction in both sides arsenals of strategic nuclear arms 
senate majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia in the 
democratic response to the presidents speech warned against 
rushing such a treaty through something reagan has said he will 
not do 
with arms control agreements the devil is always in the 
details byrd said thats why it would be unwise to rush 
negotiations 
headlinegrabbing summits are one thing he said but 
rushing to meet a deadline on a treaty would be irresponsible 
furthermore byrd said i do not believe it would be wise to 
lock the next president into a hasty agreement be he a republican 
or a democrat 
reagan in his address said that the event that held perhaps 
the most immediate historic importance during the summit was when 
he and the soviet leader signed the legal instruments putting into 
effect their earlier treaty banning landbased intermediate and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles 
these missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the 
map or placed in storage they will have been destroyed he said 
he also said that he and gorbachev agreed that the soviet 
withdrawal from afghanistan could serve as a model for settling 
other regional conflicts 
turning to one of the most contentious issues of the summit the 
president said recently the soviets have begun to show somewhat 
more respect for human rights 
it is my hope that what took place in my moscow visit will lead 
to still greater individual freedom for the peoples of the soviet 
union he said 
if anyone had suggested even as recently as 10 years ago that 
an american president would one day be able to meet with soviet 
dissidents inside moscow itself or be able to speak to soviet 
students in their own university about human freedom well i think 
youll agree that a prediction like that would have been 
dismissed reagan said 
but this past week it happened he added seeds of freedom 
and greater trust were sown and i just have to believe that in 
ways we may not even be able to guess those seeds will take root 
and grow 
reagan also discussed the forthcoming economic summit of the 
leaders of seven industrial nations which he will attend june 1921 
in toronto and said it is my belief that liberty should be as 
important a concern in toronto as it was in moscow 
liberty in the economic sphere means low taxes it means paring 
away needless regulations and reducing counterproductive government 
planning and interference and it means keeping down barriers to 
international trade here and around the world he said 
reagan said the leaders at the economic summit will celebrate 
the success of free markets

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address delivered saturday from the oval office 
my fellow americans it was just yesterday that i returned from 
my historic moscow summit meeting with general secretary mikhail 
s gorbachev and it so happens that later this month ill be 
visiting canada for an economic summit with the leaders of the 
worlds industrialized nations 
i thought id take a few moments to tell you about both first 
my meeting with general secretary gorbachev in moscow the event 
that held perhaps the most immediate historic importance took place 
on wednesday it was then that general secretary gorbachev and i 
exchanged the instruments of ratification bringing into effect the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty the effect of this 
treaty will be very simply to eliminate an entire class of us and 
soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles the significance of the 
inf treaty can hardly be overstated 
for the first time ever the levels of nuclear arms will actually 
be reduced rather than having caps placed on their growth these 
missiles will not simply have been shuffled around on the map or 
placed in storage they will have been destroyed the exchange of 
these instruments of ratification alone would have made the moscow 
summit a success but the general secretary and i made important 
progress in other areas as well we moved ahead on strategic arms 
reducation treaty start negotiations negotiations that would lead 
to a dramatic reduction in both sides arsenals of strategic nuclear 
arms 
on bilateral issues im especially pleased by our agreement to 
hold increased exchanges involving high school students the number 
of students will at first be in the hundreds but could grow into 
the thousands imagine it hundreds and then thousands of young 
people who have firsthand knowledge of each others country and 
yes who have made friends 
turning to regional conflicts mr gorbachev and i discussed ways 
to reduce tension in areas around the globe southeast asia africa 
central america the persian gulf and the middle east the 
withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan of course represents 
an historic step in itself one that the general secretary and i 
agreed could serve as a model for settling other regional conflicts 
a key part of my agenda for this moscow summit as for my previous 
meetings with the general secretary involved human rights 
recently the soviets have begun to show somewhat more respect 
for human rights in the past year for example they have released 
some 300 political detainees from detention its my hope that what 
took place in my moscow visit will lead to still greater individual 
freedom for the peoples of the soviet union 
you see in addition to my meetings with mr gorbachev i held 
other meetings with monks at a monastery in moscow with nearly 100 
dissidents and refuseniks men and women who have worked for years 
for the freedom to speak to worship to assemble and to travel 
and at moscow university with students indeed with the very 
students likely to become the soviet unions next generation of 
leaders to the dissidents and refuseniks i was able to say the 
people of the united states and elsewhere support you to the 
students i suggested there is another way to live and govern 
your country a way of democracy and economic growth a way in 
which creative human energies are released 
if anyone had suggested even as recently as 10 years ago that 
an american president would one day be able to meet with soviet 
dissidents inside moscow itself or be able to speak to soviet 
students in their own university about human freedom well i think 
youll agree that a prediction like that would have been dismissed 
but this past week it happened seeds of freedom and greater 
trust were sewn and i just have to believe that in ways we may not 
even be able to guess those seeds will take root and grow 
accompanying these new political freedoms are a series of 
economic reforms that may begin to inject elements of free 
enterprise into the soviet economy in two weeks ill be attending 
my final economic summit in toronto where the western countries 
will celebrate the success of free markets its my belief that 
liberty should be as important a concern in toronto as it was in 
moscow 
liberty in the economic sphere means low taxes it means paring 
away needless regulations and reducing counterproductive government 
planning and interference and it means keeping down barriers to 
international trade here and around the world 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

reagan also discussed the forthcoming economic summit of the 
leaders of seven industrial nations which he will attend june 1921 
in toronto and said it is my belief that liberty should be as 
important a concern in toronto as it was in moscow 
liberty in the economic sphere means low taxes it means paring 
away needless regulations and reducing counterproductive government 
planning and interference and it means keeping down barriers to 
international trade here and around the world he said 
reagan said the leaders at the economic summit will celebrate 
the success of free markets

here is the text of the weekly democratic radio 
address delivered saturday by senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva 
good afternoon this is sen robert byrd speaking to you from 
charleston wva at the invitation of president reagan i attended 
the summit meeting in moscow this week along with senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas 
our presence at the summit served to demonstrate our unique 
system of shared powers presidents negotiate treaties the senate 
gives its advice and consent only then does a treaty become the law 
of the land 
summit meetings are valuable in forging a better understanding 
between the american and soviet peoples president reagan received 
unprecedented exposure the soviet people were impressed by his 
personality and willingness to listen 
now there is talk of further progress on arms control at the 
strategic arms reduction or start level compared to a start 
treaty however the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty 
was a simple matter 
senate consideration of the inf treaty consumed four months it 
was time well spent the inf treaty is now a better treaty because 
of questions raised by the senate theres no substitute for the 
painstaking work by our negotiating experts in geneva when the 
senate raised important questions on the inf treaty our experts 
returned to the negotiating table to do the work they had left 
undone 
with arms control agreements the devil is always in the details 
thats why it would be unwise to rush negotiations on start 
headlinegrabbing summits are one thing but rushing to meet a 
deadline on a treaty as important as start would be irresponsible 
the inf treaty covers about 2 percent of all nuclear weapons the 
start agreement would cover 50 percent of all strategic weapons 
now may be a good time to reduce the fanfare of the summit and 
let the negotiators do their important work in quiet further with 
a change of presidents on the horizon i do not believe it would be 
wise to lock the next president into a hasty agreement be he a 
republican or a democrat 
another priority for america and her allies is to work hard for a 
reduction in conventional weapons in europe and a complete ban on 
all chemical weapons the soviets enjoy a huge advantage in 
conventional forces in europe an advantage that we cant allow them 
to have forever now is the time to push hard at the conventional 
arms control table 
ussoviet relations are entering a new era and there are 
opportunities in addition to arms control for our two nations to 
work together to solve critical problems 
i suggested to president reagan in moscow that he propose a new 
program of cooperation with the soviet union in the war on drugs i 
did so after hearing mr mikhail s gorbachevs proposal for a 
joint effort to send astronauts to mars why fly men to mars when 
millions of american and soviet citizens need help right here on 
earth 
the soviet union has a serious problem with alcoholism and here 
at home we are under siege by the drug lords we must attack the 
plague of drug abuse on two fronts we have to educate our people to 
the dangers of drug abuse to discourage the demand side of the drug 
problem here at home 
we have to fight the supply side of the drug war on every 
international front the soviet unions worldwide operations and 
influence could be of help to us and to them as we grapple with the 
drug tide crashing in our shores and we can help the soviet union 
with their alcohol abuse problem and their own growing drug problem 
both sides have experience knowledge and resources that we ought to 
marshal if we can make progress on eliminating arms together why 
cant we make progress on eliminating drug abuse and the plague of 
alcoholism 
the apostle paul said where the spirit of the lord is there 
is liberty i close by saying that glasnost may be growing in the 
soviet union mr gorbachev has authorized the distribution of 
100000 bibles in his country one hundred thousand bibles wont go 
far in a country that has 280 million people 
i wrote to mr gorbachev to commend him on this step i urged him 
to expand that number and to see that translations for the many 
languages in his country are available to the soviet people 
throughout the soviet unions 15 republics 
mr gorbachev has shown courage in moving his country into the 
sunlight but glasnost will not be real until human rights 
including freedom of religion are granted to every soviet citizen 
if glasnost is ever opened to a renewal of freedom of worship then 
in pauls words there will be liberty in the soviet union 
god bless you and thank you for listening

a plot to lure colombian drug lord 
carlos lehder rivas into the arms of us agents by using his 
friendship with a convicted smuggler was in the works when lehder 
was caught by police in 1987 following a shootout at a jungle 
mansion 
lehder 38 was convicted in may following a sevenmonth trial 
of all 11 counts of a 1981 indictment that alleged he conspired to 
smuggle some 33 tons of cocaine into the united states via the 
bahamas from 1978 to 1980 
lehder a leader of the medellin cartel of colombian drug 
smugglers faces life plus 150 years in prison when he is sentenced 
july 20 by us district judge howell w melton the cartel has been 
blamed for smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine brought into this 
country 
george jung 45 the first witness in lehders trial said he was 
contacted by an fbi agent in 1986 with a proposal that he travel to 
south america to help lure lehder into a position where he could be 
captured by us agents such as on a ship in international waters 
the plan was finalized it was to the point that i was going to 
go down there jung of weymouth mass said in a jailhouse 
interview with the associated press 
federal officials asked that jungs location not be revealed 
an fbi official in washington confirmed jungs story on the 
condition that his identity not be revealed 
he said the plan never got past the discussion stage because of 
lehders arrest in colombia in february 1987 and because of the 
incredible amount of paperwork and approvals required for such an 
operation 
jung met lehder when both were inmates in federal prison in 
danbury conn in 1974 and said he considered the young brash 
colombian as a brother 
he was very intelligent articulate wellmannered he had an 
elegance about him he was a cut above the rest said jung 
they formed a cocaine business using lehders drug connections 
and jungs contacts in this country 
their first trips involved young women who brought back cocaine 
hidden in the lining of suitcases jung then began making one or two 
flights a week to california carrying 15 to 25 kilograms and 
dealing with connections he had made in the marijuana business 
we introduced the drug on a large scale in la jung said 
that relationship eventually soured when lehder went behind his 
back and cut jung out of the business 
in february 1986 while lehder was still a fugitive hiding in the 
jungles of south america jung said he was contacted by federal 
agents while he was being held in miami awaiting trial on charges he 
smuggled some 660 pounds of cocaine into the united states 
they were working on a plan for me to go down to colombia and 
befriend carlos again he said it set me back for a few 
minutes 
in june 1986 jung pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to 
import cocaine and was sentenced to 15 years 
that fall discussions began again including a possible mock 
prison escape as a cover story a reason for me to be back in 
colombia 
before the plan could be put in motion jung heard a television 
report of lehders arrest near medellin colombia lehder was 
immediately placed on a plane and flown to the united states 
jung said he was promised nothing in exchange for his testimony 
against lehder although prosecutors promised to make his 
cooperation known to his sentencing judge who was considering a 
motion for reduction of sentence 
so far jung has not heard anything about his sentence being 
reduced 
jung was the first of 115 witnesses to take the stand against 
lehder 
we definitely looked at each other it was like it had come 
to an end and it was time to clear the books said jung i had 
no second thoughts no qualms 
while in prison jung has written a book on his life of crime 
called grazing in the grass until the snow came

thousands of demonstrators shouting 
antigovernment slogans marched saturday to protest president 
hussain muhammad ershads proposal to make islam the state religion 
about 3000 teachers doctors engineers journalists and womens 
groups joined the march in the capital after a rally outside dhaka 
university 
they carried banners reading we do not accept state 
interference in individuals rights ershad must go and no 
politics with religion 
ershads government on may 11 proposed a constitutional amendment 
that would make islam the state religion more than 85 percent of 
bangladeshs 105 million people are moslem 
the proposed amendment also says other religions may be practiced 
in peace and harmony in the country 
but the bill currently being debated in parliament has drawn 
sharp criticism opposition politicians and womens groups contend 
it would undercut fundamental freedoms 
ershads jatiya party holds 213 out of 300 seats in the 
parliament and could force the legislation through but several 
senior government officials have suggested that a public referendum 
may be called on the issue 
christian leaders in bangladesh expressed concern over the 
proposal and urged the government to withdraw the bill 
whenever religion becomes a concern of the state it passes 
into the hands of political powers the religious leaders said in 
a statement published saturday in the englishlanguage new nation 
newspaper 
among the signers was the rev michael rozario the roman 
catholic archbishop of dhaka others represented the baptists the 
national christian fellowship and other protestant denominations 
there are an estimated 250000 christians in bangladesh the 
other minority groups are hindus and buddhists 
ershad has been the target of an opposition campaign to oust him 
since last november 
the countrys largest opposition coalition led by sheik hasina 
of the awami league said it would launch a fiveday national 
protest against the proposed amendment starting sunday 
some political analysts in dhaka have said they believe ershad 
launched the campaign on islam to win the support of moslem 
fundamentalists 
several conservative moslem groups have campaigned to make 
bangladesh an islamic republic and to change its legal system to one 
that follows the koran the moslem holy book 
bangladesh has been a secular state since it was created after a 
war of independence from pakistan in 1971

a mundane remodeling job on a house 
became a landlords dream for leonard gooding when he removed some 
siding and discovered his old house was actually a cabin made of 
handhewn logs 
its in perfect shape i dont know whats going to happen 
now gooding said in a telephone interview friday 
the building of white oak logs is 30 feet wide and 50 feet long 
it has hardwood floors six windows three each on the longest 
walls and a door on either end theres no fireplace or plumbing 
but it is wired for electricity 
gooding bought the building from a nephew who owned it for 10 
years 
before that it was used as a church by the assemblies of god for 
dozens of years and its shape leads gooding to think thats what it 
was originally built for 
some of my older neighbors remember seeing the log house as 
kids we just dont know how old it really is said gooding 
adding that he knows it goes back at least until 1939 
gooding is considering uses for the building 
im already getting some interest and some offers on it he 
said i think it would make a nice antique store or lake home or 
even a restaurant i may sell it to someone who wants to move it 
its sure something that changes your mind it completely 
turned me around

in the frantic minutes after an 
explosion rocked the borken mine veteran miner thomas gepperth led 
his tiny group from the deadly carbon monoxide to survival in what 
west germans have dubbed the miracle of borken 
before gepperth and his five colleagues were found officials 
repeatedly had said none of the 57 men trapped could have survived 
thirtyseven were confirmed dead and 14 were missing 
the six men their faces blackened were pulled to the surface on 
stretchers over a 45minute period beginning at 530 am saturday 
the group had spent 65 hours about 500 feet underground after the 
explosion that blasted the stolzenbach mine with earthquakelike 
force 
the tall blond gepperth 36 stood calmly with the others four 
west germans and one turk as they posed for photographers after 
washing up the five were identified as helmut gesner heinz roese 
egon dehn and wilfried doench and ahmet batkan 
everybody was making their last wills and testaments 
gepperth said as he appeared after the dramatic rescue i told 
them they didnt have to his brief remarks were made in an 
interview with state television 
i never gave up i always said theyll make it and get us out 
of here gepperth said 
another survivor also interviewed on state television but not 
identified by name said the survivors heard drilling on friday but 
then the noises temporarily stopped 
that was really agonizing because nothing more was going on up 
there you start thinking have they forgotten us or something 
maybe theyre figuring its not worth it 
the man said that in the hours of waiting he began to see 
lights that arent really there 
heinz cramer a board member of the company that owns the mine 
gave an account of the survival 
he said the group tried to flee toward the exit after the 
explosion 
the mining superviser gepperth who is also a member of the 
mines rescue squad recognized it was carbon monoxide poisoning 
he continued 
cramer said gepperth ordered his men to turn away from the 
direction of the exit from where the poison was coming and walk 
toward an air pocket 
so they turned around and found shelter in one of the side 
areas cramer said gepperth told them to remain quiet and 
calm so they would preserve the oxygen 
you can certainly call gepperths actions something special he 
reacted in exactly the right way he said 
a man who identified himself as egon dehns brotherinlaw said 
the six kept their spirits up by recalling a 1963 mining accident in 
the lower saxony region in which 11 men were rescued after two weeks 
the 1963 accident has become known as the miracle of lengede 
after the mining town where it occurred and west germans quickly 
dubbed the saturday rescue the miracle of borken 
cramer said search efforts were being stepped up following 
unconfirmed reports that two more survivors may be in a nearby area 
its a faint hope but a superviser said there were tracks of 
two people who may also be in an area where they may have 
survived cramer said 
petercarl ruehland a spokesman for the mine owner preussen 
elektra declined to speculate on how much longer the six men could 
have survived in the mine 
to the right and to the left of where they were the levels of 
carbon monoxide were rising ruehland said

organizers of a gathering on highspeed train 
travel touted a halfdozen versions of superfast trains as potential 
solutions to growing airport and road congestion in the united 
states but none of the prototypes was made in america 
the trains some now operating and some in the experimental 
stage can reach speeds of 130 to 300 miles an hour four had trains 
with wheels and two had wheelless vehicles that use a magnetic 
levitation system that system uses electromagnetic force for 
guidance and propulsion with the train maintaining minimum contact 
with a guideway 
in a speech during the high speed rail associations meeting 
john h riley the us governments rail administrator predicted 
highspeed rail would be a reality in our lifetime and said he 
could not imagine that the united states would be the only advanced 
country left behind when the highspeed train leaves the station 
a dozen projects using highspeed trains are being considered in 
the united states which was built up by railroads a century ago 
but the us proposals are all in the early stages delegates the 
meeting were told this past week 
the prototypes which come from europe japan and canada are 
west germanys intercontinental express train which on a may 1 
trial run with passengers set a new speed record for wheeled trains 
of 252 mph

exactly what an unidentified deafmute boy 
has gone through remains a mystery in spite of his repeated 
drawings showing a crashed plane with bodies that may be his 
parents an fbi agent said saturday 
we have no clues at all said agent terry kincaid 
of the boys drawings he said we have no idea how much of his 
sketches are his own idea or his imagination or maybe recreations 
of popular television shows 
the boy has been in a child protective service center since 
november in juarez mexico where he was found on the streets but 
investigators suspect he might be from the united states because of 
his preferences in food and games 
the boy is believed to be 7 or 8 years old and is called sabat by 
welfare workers because he was found on a saturday 
investigators have discovered that the boy has been in the united 
states at least once kincaid said saturday 
before taking him to the center guadalupe de la vega the juarez 
woman who found him wandering about took him to see an ear 
specialist in new york and then brought him back to mexico kincaid 
said 
the womans first encounter with the boy was surprising 
he was on the streets in juarez and this woman thought he was 
begging she gave him a thousand pesos and he handed it back to 
her kincaid said 
from the way he keeps drawing the same pictures and has his 
clothes packed i think he is desperate to find his way back home 
said leticia cota a social worker in juarez 
we are continuing efforts to develop leads as to this little 
guys identity through whatever means possible its going to be an 
uphill struggle said kincaid 
kincaid said that during the trip to new york the boy became 
excited when he saw a soldier were exploring the possibility 
that his father may have been a policeman or soldier or someone 
associated with a uniform he said 
kincaid said mexican social workers initially thought the boy was 
mexican until he showed a preference for hamburgers over mexican 
food 
he draws a house with a pitched roof not common in mexico and 
indicates it was his home he excels at video games with which few 
mexican children are familiar and is familiar with us currency 
mexican social workers contacted their el paso counterparts last 
month and the center for missing and exploited children in 
washington sought the help of the fbi in el paso last week to find 
the boys identity 
at least two leads are being pursued said luis torre a 
caseworker for the texas department of human services in el paso 
law officials think he resembles a boy from illinois who was 
reported missing about three years ago or a boy from a military 
family who lived in alaska torre said 
kincaid said officials expected to receive by monday copies of 
footprints of a child who was kidnapped from decatur ill in 
october 1985 the description of the kidnapped child was forwarded 
from the center for missing and exploited children 
kincaid said the boy is in good health he seems to have a good 
attitude notwithstanding everything he has apparently gone 
through kincaid said 
his pictures of a crashed airplane include people that he 
describes as his father mother younger sister and himself and have 
the numbers 28d 23 written under the airplane 
during an interview friday the boy pointed to scars on his left 
knee stomach and back and back to the crash drawing he pointed to 
a drawing of himself walking away from the crash while the figures 
believed to be his parents and sister lay dead 
the age of the boys scars led doctors to believe that if they 
had been caused by a crash it would have been two to three years 
ago 
social workers said that through drawings and other 
communication the boy has revealed background details that indicate 
his father was missing four fingers on his right hand and had a 
mustache and that the family lived in a place that had kneedeep 
snow heavy rainfall mountains and trees 
the boy is 4 feet 6 has dark blond to light brown hair and a 
slightly freckled white complexion

secretary of state george p shultz met with king 
hussein saturday and said the jordanian monarch is reluctant to 
engage in peace talks with israel unless israel agrees to give up 
land on the west bank 
if they feel there is no territorial compromise possible they 
then feel what am i going to negotiate about shultz told 
reporters during his trip back to egypt from the jordanian capital 
of amman 
shultz on a mission to promote a us peace plan for the region 
flies to israel on sunday to try to get the assurance hussein seeks 
from prime minister yitzhak shamir his prospects are not bright 
shamir told israel radio saturday he still opposes the us 
proposal for an international peace conference and does not expect a 
breakthrough during shultzs visit he also opposes trading land for 
peace the other essential part of the american plan 
during his 2hour meeting shultz said he found an intensity 
of interest by hussein in the us plan for arabisraeli 
negotiations as a general proposition they are in favor of 
proceeding shultz said 
but hussein hesitates to say yes we will go into the talks 
until they have some assurances that its going to be based on the 
formula of trading territory for peace shultz said 
jordan controlled the west bank from 1948 until 1967 when it 
joined egypt and syria in a war with israel and lost the territory 
including east jerusalem 
shultz supports jordans demand for an israeli withdrawal from 
the west bank but has said giving up all the land was not in the 
cards 
shultz has two sessions scheduled sunday with shamir and separate 
meetings with foreign minister shimon peres defense minister 
yitzhak rabin and members of the israeli parliament the knesset 
this is his fourth trip to the area this year shultz said on his 
arrival friday night he knew the odds were against him 
shultz began the day with a session with president hosni mubarak 
of egypt who has endorsed the us approach in principle shultz 
has made cairo his base shuttling from the egyptian capital to meet 
with other leaders 
we had a good personal visit shultz said after he and 
mubarak spent an hour in private its good to start this trip to 
the middle east here in egypt we worked together earlier this year 
trying to get this initiative going 
but in a session with egyptian editors before flying to amman he 
said the situation remains one in which there are great problems 
shultz said president reagan wants to accomplish as much as he 
can and to leave as much of a constructive base for his successors 
as possible 
in the interview shultz expressed understanding for shamirs 
security concerns israel cannot afford to make a bad mistake in 
this regard he said 
but shultz said he also had told the israeli prime minister that 
its possible to be too careful and miss opportunities that may 
not appear again 
at the same time shultz said he doubted the workability of 
an independent palestinian state he said americans understood the 
concept of a palestinian movement but the palestine liberation 
organizations sponsorship of terrorist activities made it an 
unacceptable negotiating partner for israel 
in algiers president chadli bendjedid of algeria said shultzs 
peace mission was doomed because of the obstinate american 
refusal to recognize palestinian rights the official news agency 
reported 
arab leaders will open a summit meeting in the algerian capital 
tuesday to discuss support for palestinian arabs in their uprising 
against israeli authorities 
saud alfaisal the foreign minister of saudi arabia said in 
jiddah it was a sacred duty for the arabs to support the 
uprising in which more than 200 palestinians have died since dec 8

no 2 kremlin leader yegor k ligachev broke his 
silence saturday on reports that he leads a conservative faction and 
said enemies are trying to divide a leadership united behind mikhail 
s gorbachevs reforms 
adversaries in the west and some people in our country too 
are making allegations about differences among the soviet 
leadership in the politburo the 67yearold ligachev said 
these allegations have been made more than once which means 
they are being made deliberately trying to drive a wedge in the 
leadership is a notorious trick he said 
the soviet news agency tass carried ligachevs remarks made at a 
meeting in togliatti a volga river port 600 miles east of moscow 
they were his first comments on reports of discord in the leadership 
in an excerpt of the speech broadcast on the evening television 
news program vremya the roundfaced grayhaired ligachev told 
an auditorium of togliatti officials and residents that the soviet 
unions enemies are foolish to try to divide the leadership 
if it worked in the past when they threw out falsehoods about 
previous leading figures and it led to the ruin of people then in 
current conditions such a trick simply wont go through for these 
are different times with a different policy and different 
leaders ligachev declared 
all the members of the leadership with mikhail gorbachev at 
their head are deeply committed to the cause of perestroika he 
said 
ligachev a full member of the 13man ruling politburo in charge 
of communist party ideology has indicated in earlier speeches that 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness has gone too far in 
criticizing past economic and social policies 
there have been other signs that he favors a more cautious 
approach than gorbachev to perestroika the program of restructuring 
soviet society 
in referring to soviet adversaries alleging leadership 
differences ligachev probably had in mind boris n yeltsin 
yeltsin a former gorbachev protege and exmoscow party boss 
told the british broadcasting corp last monday that ligachev should 
step down because processes in the party are too slow because the 
party is still lagging behind because the process of 
democratization is not developing and comrade ligachev is the 
main person responsible 
yeltsin later denied suggesting that ligachev resign 
gorbachev got into the fray wednesday he told the first news 
conference in moscow by a soviet leader that the communist partys 
policymaking central committee does not share yeltsins views 
as for comrade ligachev and his resignation no such problem 
exists either in the central committee or in the politburo and 
thats it he said 
such public airing of topechelon kremlin disagreement is 
unprecedented 
rumors spread in moscow in midapril that ligachev and gorbachev 
had a bitter faceoff with ligachev backing a newspaper article 
defending the late dictator josef v stalin and gorbachev 
counterattacking through another article pushing radical reforms 
the two have made several public appearances together since then 
with no obvious sign of disagreements 
in his togliatti speech ligachev tried to put himself firmly in 
the camp of reform advocates 
there are certainly people who do not accept perestroika 
wish to live in an old way tass paraphrased ligachev as saying 
but on the whole different processes are predominantly under way 
in this country 
he said rightists in the west fear perestroika because it 
strengthens socialism and they are trying to encourage development 
of a multiparty system in the soviet union 
all that is aimed at weakening political stability in the 
country upsetting social justice and stimulating a farreaching 
social stratification of the society tass paraphrased him as 
saying 
ligachev said the communist party will not be dismantled because 
it is the guarantee of irreversibility of perestroika

studies into possible links between cancer and 
alcohol suggest that only one or two drinks can be enough to have a 
carcinogenic effect according to a university of california 
research team 
uc berkeley researchers reported friday in the proceedings of the 
national academy of sciences that they found that when dna the 
essential component of living matter is damaged by alcohol it 
closely resembles dna altered by known carcinogens 
the findings come on the heels of a california scientific 
advisory panels recommendation in april that alcohol be added to a 
state list of chemicals known to cause cancer 
this certainly reinforces our decision said alice whittemore 
of stanford university a member of the panel created by gov george 
deukmejian under a toxics initiative passed by voters 
alcohol will appear on the toxics list july 1 state health and 
welfare undersecretary thomas e warriner said the industry will 
then have 12 months to work out how it will provide the warning 
such warnings could take the form of notices posted in bars and 
restaurants there also have been proposals that warnings be placed 
on individual beverage containers 
the alcohol industry has resisted such warning labels arguing 
that it has never been demonstrated in animal tests that alcohol can 
cause cancer 
the researchers said they found that dna deoxyribonucleic acid 
is chemically changed when combined in test tube experiments with 
alcohol and acetaldehyde the principal product formed from alcohol 
in mammalian cells 
the altered dna is similar to that produced by other chemicals 
known to cause cancer said molecular biologists heinz 
fraenkelconrat and bea singer of berkeley 
those alterations occur at concentrations of alcohol and 
acetaldehyde that would be produced by only one or two drinks said 
the researchers who are husband and wife 
they added that they didnt know exactly how much drinking might 
cause cancer but ms singer said i am convinced alcohol is a 
carcinogen 
michelle corash a lawyer representing the alcohol industry 
reiterated the industrys position 
every other chemical that causes cancer in humans also causes 
it in animals so we dont think alcohol is a carcinogen she said 
in the past the only evidence linking alcohol to cancer has come 
from epidemiological studies that suggest a higher incidence of 
tumors of the breast liver rectum and mouth in humans who consume 
moderate to large amounts of alcohol 
fraenkelconrat and ms singer are working with biologist martha 
r stampfer of the lawrence berkeley laboratory to determine if 
alcohol and acetaldehyde can cause tumors in human breast cells 
grown in the laboratory if tumors are formed there they say they 
will then expand their studies to include animals

an italian journalist jailed for more than six months 
in afghanistan said he had to rely on the charity of other prisoners 
to get enough to eat and that he wanted to go back to afghanistan 
fausto biloslavo 26 arrived in rome on thursday aboard a 
special private plane from kabul he had entered afghanistan in july 
with antimarxist insurgents and was arrested nov 14 after he was 
captured by two children with machine guns 
in march he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to seven 
years in prison his release thursday came after a plea from italian 
president francesco cossiga he had shared a cell with french 
freelance photojournalist alain guillo who was freed last week 
after an appeal by french president francois mitterrand 
during a news conference friday biloslavo declined to give many 
specifics about his imprisonment he said he will eventually publish 
notes he wrote on the inside of cigarette packages 
he said he was held at puli charki prison in kabul after his 
trial 
i had to relay on the charity of the poor people held there in 
order to have enough to eat and clothes to wear he said later 
he said an italian diplomatic official helped him get enough food 
and clothing 
he said that besides the afghan prisoners at puli charki he saw 
40 pakistanis 20 iranians and a young turk he said 95 percent of 
the foreigners had been brutally tortured but he declined to 
say how 
biloslavo said he was not beaten after his imprisonment but said 
he was whipped by an officer after his capture 
he denied that someone could have turned him in but added that 
the afghan resistance movement is extremely fragmented and 
contains a number of rogues for whom a reporter would be worth 
thousands of dollars 
after his arrest he said he was taken to the prison of the 
secret police where he was held for four months in conditions 
he described as decent 
biloslavo said his trial was a farce and that the accusations 
were crazy 
he said he was never given any hints as to his approaching 
liberation and the only way he had kept in touch with the outside 
world were through rumors and the official television 
he said he would seek a visa to return to afghanistan 
anticommunist guerrillas have been fighting a civil war in 
afghanistan since the late 1970s soviet troops entered the country 
in 1979 replacing one prosoviet regime with another and staying to 
protect that regime from the guerrillas 
the soviets began withdrawing their estimated 115000 troops from 
afghanistan in may

a group of american students who spent two months 
in the soviet union return home this week buoyed by experiences 
that ranged from wading in a russian swamp to feeling the 
electricity of superpower summitry 
the 16 students mostly from dartmouth college in new hampshire 
took classes in russian language and literature as well as 
environmental issues at moscow state university the program was 
born of the december summit meeting in washington 
in return a like number of soviet students will study in 
hanover nh this summer 
the students witnessed the hopeful political changes under 
mikhail s gorbachev but they also saw the prejudices toward women 
blacks and jews as well as the bleakness of the soviet economy 
there was graffiti in the elevator at the university said 
celia jablow a senior from claremont calif it said kill a jew 
save the soviet union one of our people erased it 
it is really a hard thing to talk to someone for two hours 
continuously about how much they hate blacks and how incompetent 
biologically they think they are added catherine atwell a junior 
from washington dc 
she also recounted hearing continually how women should stay in 
the home as well as hearing the phrase youve got a girls 
memory 
but the students said that muscovites seemed to be more 
politically aware under gorbachev less afraid of foreigners and 
more hopeful about their future although the economic changes are 
slow to arrive what with shortages of sugar and toothpaste 
on may 29 while on a field trip to a swampy nature preserve near 
the oka river about 70 miles northwest of moscow the group 
gathered around a tv set in the home of a groundskeeper and joined a 
group of russians to watch president reagan land in the soviet union 
they were really happy to see reagan much happier than we 
were said atwell 
yeah we made a few cynical remarks along the way you know 
typical american students added peter macdonald a junior from 
andover mass when reagan spoke everyone would watch us and when 
gorbachev spoke everyone of us would watch them 
the americans who have all concentrated on russian studies and 
have studied the language an average of three years were questioned 
by the soviets on reagans referring to their country as the evil 
empire 
they asked us did he really say that atwell said 
another of the dartmouth group paul wlodkowski of augusta 
maine met briefly with reagan after his speech to moscow university 
students and acted as a translator for cable news network 
jablow said their student accomodations werent bad but the main 
problem was a certain feeling of being trapped there were no 
telephones in the dormitory rooms which each housed two students 
visitors would drop by often and not understand the need to be 
alone at times when you need your own space jablow said 
there was little time to do sightseeing she said most of your 
time you werent in class or doing homework you felt an obligation 
at least i did to meet people and talk 
although the exchange program was designed to concentrate on 
environmental studies group adviser and dartmouth professor barry 
scherr said its real purpose was to give the students greater 
exposure to russian language literature and society 
other dartmouth students on the trip were loretta berger of 
lexington mass katherine chernishov of riverdale ny heidi 
crebo of marstons mills mass mark filimonov of hanover nh 
joseph hatem of methuen mass betsy heafitz of swampscott mass 
peter hujik of monona wis jeffrey matusow of durham nh and 
allison smith of bath ohio 
there also were two students from minnesotas carleton college 
brett duffy and anders nelson and deborah budek of wheaton college 
in massachusetts

a circuit court judge has ruled that a 
woman smoker may not light up in confined areas around her 
4yearold child but the angry woman says shell appeal the order 
exposing a child whose lungs are still growing to passive smoke 
is another form of child abuse judge bill swann said friday after 
issuing the order to priscilla bullock 
ms bullock said she was in court to respond to a petition filed 
by her exhusband christopher reeves to lower his childsupport 
payment and to modify visitation privileges his petition was denied 
two months ago and he was appealing to swann 
the petition was denied again but ms bullock said that from 
out of the blue swann granted a request by her exhusbands 
lawyer to prohibit the mother from smoking around the child in a 
confined environment such as a home or a car 
i am 30 years old this is a violation of my civil rights 
she said my former husband drinks beer and i didnt say he 
couldnt drink around the child 
its time for me to move out of tennessee if a judge can keep 
me from having a cigarette in my own home 
ms bullock also must not allow others to smoke in her home if 
the child is present 
swann who said he has made similar rulings in the past two 
years said in these cases the court takes judicial notice of the 
particular dangers passive smoke has on developing lungs 
he said providing a healthy environment is as important as 
ensuring the child has adequate food clothing shelter and 
education 
ms bullock said she would appeal swanns ruling

an avianca airlines cargo jet was seized saturday 
and the carrier fined nearly 8 million after customs agents found 
490 pounds of cocaine stashed in a shipment of red roses 
this is the 14th time since january 1986 that drugs were 
found aboard an avianca flight said customs spokesman michael 
sheehan avianca is a source of great concern for the customs

roses sheehan said 
eight of the rose boxes were packed with cocaine he said 
all 2000 boxes were checked each of the eight boxes weighed 
about twice as much as a normal box which should weigh about 30 
pounds sheehan said no arrests were made 
the carriers boeing 747 was seized at miami international 
airport to ensure payment of fines levied for saturdays cache 
avianca must pay 16000 for each pound of cocaine or its plane

sleek red ferrari sports car to the cheers of a crowd saturday when 
he visited the headquarters of italys most renowned racing team 
piero lardi ferrari the son of the companys grand old boss 
drove the mondial cabrio along the fiorano track near modena 
where the companys formula one racers are tested 
the car capable of reaching speeds in excess of 155 mph 
occasionally sputtered as it moved around the track at 12 to 18 mph 
with the pope aboard 
john paul on his second day of a fiveday visit to the 
emiliaromagna region stood and clenched the windshield as the car 
negotiated the twisty course between two lines of several hundred 
cheering faithful 
il papa in pista the pope on the track the announcer 
shouted into the loudspeakers the drive was the highlight of the 
pontiffs threehour visit 
the pope had been expected to meet enzo ferrari the 90yearold 
company chairman and avowed agnostic who in the past has had stormy 
relations with the vatican which had harshly criticized his racing 
activities 
piero lardi ferrari said the meeting was canceled because his 
father developed a fever thursday night and preferred not to leave 
home the elder ferrari suffers from a kidney disease his son 
said saturday that his fathers condition was not serious 
the pope met privately with ferrari relatives and talked to the 
elder ferrari by telephone 
they spoke for about five minutes vatican spokesman giovanni 
dercole said it was a courtesy gesture by the pope toward 
ferrari they exchanged good wishes and the pope listened with 
great attention one can imagine that ferrari was moved 
the pope also met with ferrari formula one drivers gerhard berger 
of austria and michele alboreto of italy and addressed a crowd of 
workers from a stand on the edge of the track 
he shook hands with the two drivers and cast a quick glance at a 
ferrari racer exhibited in the courtyard along with some old models 
he looked amazed and said its an impressive speed when 
berger told him it can reach 186 mph 
in his speech to a few thousand workers and their families the 
pope denounced serious pollution and threats to the environment 
caused by the anxiety of the maximum profit which leads to a 
senseless exploitation of natural resources 
he again emphasized the right to work for all people and said 
that technological innovations must be pursued and accepted but 
must be oriented to the service of the man 
before leaving fiorano he thanked the audience for your 
patience and for the gifts which allow me to make some charity 
the gifts included a horse and dozens of wheels of parmesan 
cheese

the moscow summit offered the soviets a forum to 
show off mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and a chance to boost the 
kremlin leader on the eve of a communist party conference crucial to 
the success of his policies 
while the us media devoted much space and time to the meeting 
between president reagan and gorbachev the soviet media devoted at 
least as much space if not more to discussion of the party 
conference and a reform document published on the eve of the summit 
that outlines more potentially radical reforms 
soviet television coverage of the summit meanwhile portrayed 
gorbachev as a dynamic sophisticated world leader 
reagan helped promote that image during his stay by repeatedly 
acknowledging the blossoming of the staterun arts and media 
restructuring of the economy and freeing of some political prisoners 
under gorbachev 
in fact reagan appeared so impressed with gorbachevs policies 
that he withdrew his earlier characterization of the soviet union as 
an evil empire and when it came time for reagan to leave he 
bid a warm farewell to a leader he said had become a personal friend 
but the air of good will did not hide the fact that gorbachev is 
waging a battle to win the support of the 5000 communist party 
delegates to the national conference which begins june 28 the 
conference is the first of its kind since 1941 
gorbachev has said he wants partisans of perestroika his 
effort to restructure soviet society elected as delegates to the 
conference at the same time the soviet leader has indicated that 
he does not want any party conflicts out in the open and he 
studiously avoided mention of the party conference during the summit 
but that did not stop soviet reformers from speaking out about 
the fierce fight being waged by orthodox communists and outspoken 
gorbachev supporters over delegate elections to the conference 
some of the liberals ousted as delegates were restored to the 
list when the moscow party hierarchy intervened after the summit 
gorbachev moving straight from summitry to his internal 
problems attended the moscow party meeting that made the decisions 
but staterun media gave no clue as to whether he spoke out in favor 
of the move they did report however that he stressed the 
importance of his domestic reforms to the success of the summit with 
reagan 
boris yeltsin the ousted moscow communist party boss dropped 
from the ruling politburo last february took the most dramatic 
step giving two interviews to western television stations in which 
he called for the resignation of the kremlins no 2 official yegor 
k ligachev 
yeltsin is said to have criticized the slow pace of reform in an 
unpublished speech last oct 21 that led to his ouster this week 
he took the unprecedented step of using western interviews to assail 
ligachev for allegedly blocking reform 
ligachev himself said saturday that enemies are trying to divide 
a leadership united behind gorbachevs reforms 
adversaries in the west and some people in our country too 
are making allegations about differences among the soviet 
leadership in the politburo he said 
gorbachev insisted at his news conference last week that there is 
no movement to force ligachev to step down 
at the same time however the proreform weekly ogonyok and the 
weekly moscow news available in english spanish french german 
and arabic as well as russian published candid articles about 
maneuvers used to ease reformers off the conference slate 
organizers of the soviet unions fledgling independent political 
party the democratic union founded on may 4 held a meeting of 
1500 people in leningrad last weekend demanding a multiparty 
system and fairer delegate selection 
smaller protests on this and other issues such as jewish 
emigration took place daily in moscow during the summit with 
police watching in silence 
vitaly korotich editor of ogonyok said moscow students went to 
the citys pushkin square last week to collect signatures on a 
petition demanding he be a conference delegate 
sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya writer fyodor burlatsky 
historian yuri afanasyev and korotich told western reporters in news 
conferences or interviews that they failed to gain election as 
delegates in an initial round of voting 
burlatsky said the problems were due to the fact that we are 
learning democracy 
korotich too blamed the maneuvering on the lack of a political 
culture 
we have to learn not to be afraid he said in an interview 
we have to get rid of the stalinist remnants under stalin it was 
easy he had a theory of enemies that made everybody afraid of one 
another 
banging on a desk for emphasis he added if you thought this 
desk was bad you could just say it was made by enemies simple as 
that 
perestroika he added is just a big return to the norm we 
have to become normal again 
foreign ministry press center officials were swift to accede to 
western reporters requests for interviews with the most outspoken 
proponents of reform who also took the dais at news conferences for 
hundreds of journalists 
known conservatives were not seen at such forums and were not 
strongly in evidence at a meeting reagan had with writers and 
intellectuals last tuesday 
this could be the result of what gorbachev himself has described 
as passive panicky resistance to his reforms this maneuvering has 
not so far emerged into a publicly identifiable political movement 
korotich also noted that the conservatives have not yet 
presented a program and have not suggested any new leader to 
replace gorbachev as communist party general secretary 
he said he expected gorbachev to emerge strengthened from the 
conference 
the public relations campaign for gorbachevs reforms that was 
waged during the summit certainly convinced a moscow taxi driver 
who said he was from the soviet leaders home region in southern 
russia 
gorbachev is like jesus christ he volunteered to a western 
reporter during a conversation highly critical of soviet life our 
children have all forgotten how to work and he will get them going 
again

the presidential primary season ends on tuesday 
in circumstances that scarcely seemed imaginable when it began four 
months ago with michael dukakis ready to claim a nonbrokered 
democratic nomination and george bush on the defensive despite 
banishing his republican rivals 
democrat jesse jackson is the only other contestant left of 13 
wouldbe presidents who toed the starting line last winter but even 
his campaign manager concedes that dukakis is likely to wrap up the 
partys nomination by the end of the week 
for the record new jersey california montana and new mexico 
are holding primary elections on tuesday with 466 democratic 
convention delegates at stake and 265 up for grabs on the republican 
side 
but bush is unopposed as he has been for weeks and he skipped 
lightly through the final states on the calendar instead he has 
spent the last several days trying to figure out how to end a 
downward spiral that has left him trailing dukakis by doubledigit 
margins in some national polls 
ive never felt more relaxed never felt more convinced were 
on the right track he told reporters late last week after four 
days of skull sessions with aides and outside advisers 
the only suspense left in the democratic primary campaign is 
whether dukakis expected sweep of the final four contests will give 
him the 2081 delegates needed to clinch the nomination 
i hope on tuesday we will have won the nomination says susan 
estrich dukakis campaign manager the massachusetts governor 
intends to campaign extensively as the nomineeinwaiting in the 
weeks before the convention opens in july as well as open serious 
talks with jackson and select a running mate 
the hope among campaign aides is for a display of unity in the 
weeks to come from the other primary rivals including sen paul 
simon richard gephardt and albert gore jr 
the republicans have a unity display lined up already 
the vice president will make an appearance at a unity 88 
conference in denver late next week where sen bob dole rep jack 
kemp and pat robertson former rivals also will speak 
campaign manager lee atwater says bush will use his trip to begin 
speaking out more forcefully against dukakis and provide a pretty 
good taste of the flavor of the campaign for the summer 
the last act of the primary season means an end to months of 
nonstop campaigning for jackson but not an end to the campaign 
he has been pressing dukakis on issues ranging from the budget to 
policy toward south africa in recent weeks in an apparent effort to 
influence the drafting of the party platform 
on the topic of the vice presidential nominiation dukakis and 
jackson take turns probing and feinting 
jackson hasnt said he wants it but says hes entitled to 
consideration 
dukakis under intense pressure from many party regulars to look 
elsewhere for a running mate but aware that he needs jacksons 
followers to support him in the fall praises his rival lavishly and 
agrees that he is entitled to consideration but he says the results 
of the primaries do not entitle jackson to a leg up on any other 
potential running mate 
whatever follows the final days of the primary campaign seemed 
almost becalmed 
jacksons aides said they were spending about 700000 on 
television in california and would limit themselves to radio 
advertisements in new jersey that was about one quarter of the 
california budget envisioned three weeks ago when jackson dreamed of 
ambushing dukakis on the final day of the season 
dukakis spent nothing on advertising in new jersey and less than 
250000 in california what money he did spend went to air a 
commercial that seemed a preview of the fall campaign it touted his 
efforts to reduce crime in massachusetts and said he forged his 
accomplishments with hard work integrity leadership we could 
use some of that in the white house said the announcer 
bush spent no money at all on advertising in the final primary 
states he also curtailed his travel schedule wary of bumping up 
against the 27 million federal spending limit for preconvention 
campaigning 
that laidback type of campaigning particularly in the state 
that will provide the largest single block of electoral votes in the 
fall was a marked contrast to the frenzy of early contests 
several of the contenders spent roughly 750000 the legal 
maximum in iowa alone on the feb 8 caucuses that opened the 
season 
bush finished third in that opening event well behind dole and 
robertson but he dusted himself off defeated dole and the rest of 
the field in the new hampshire primary and the rout was on 
the vice president effectively locked up the nomination a few 
weeks later in a super tuesday sweep of 16 primary states on march 
8 one by one his rivals dropped from the field and the vice 
president gained a mathematical lock on the nomination when 
pennsylvania voted on april 26 
dukakis finished third as well in iowa behind gephardt and 
simon but he rebounded to win the primary in new hampshire next 
door to his massachusetts home in the turbulent weeks of 
campaigning that followed dukakis carried five primary states on 
super tuesday as did jackson and gore 
simon won his home state primary in illinois a week later with 
jackson second and dukakis third jackson dealt dukakis a stinging 
defeat 10 days later in the michigan caucuses talk of a brokered 
convention hit a high note 
but the massachusetts governor began a strong spring comeback a 
few days later in connecticut and went on to win nine out of the 
next 10 primaries eliminating his rivals one by one until only 
jackson remained

who attends the communist party conference on 
reform june 28 became the subject of backroom political maneuvering 
in moscow and a delegate list published saturday showed some of 
mikhail s gorbachevs supporters lost 
official media said late friday the moscow party leadership had 
restored the names of prominent intellectual reformers dropped from 
the list at the precinct level but the list showed some were not 
elected 
the delegate battle has been the talk of moscow for days 
staterun media and even political street protests unusual for the 
soviet union brought the internal party battle into the open 
gorbachev called the party conference the first since josef 
stalin summoned one in 1941 to act on position papers issued in 
may they include limiting the tenure of party officials separating 
party and government structures and other elements of his 
perestroika reform program 
among 319 delegates elected in moscow were gorbachev and five 
other members of the ruling politburo including viktor m 
chebrikov chief of the kgb secret police and yegor k ligachev 
the kremlins no 2 man 
media accounts said sharp debates preceded the secretballot 
election at a moscow party meeting friday 
a list published saturday in the moscows party daily moskovskaya 
pravda did not include the names of such reformers as sociologist 
tatyana zaslavskaya playwright mikhail shatrov and economist 
nikolai shmelev 
movie maker elem klimov and economist leonid abalkin other 
liberals restored made the final delegate list 
vitaly korotich editor of the proreform weekly ogonyok was one 
moscowbased reformer eased off the roster but media reports say 
the ukrainianborn writer will be a delegate for kherson a 
ukrainian port city on the black sea 
it was not clear whether other reformers would be chosen as 
delegates from outside moscow the media have said similar contests 
over delegates are occurring in other parts of the country 
the moscow party has nearly 1 million members including the 
nations leading intellectuals and officials 
gorbachev himself attended the leadership meeting friday that 
chose the final delegate list after weeks of discussion over who 
would attend the conference 
moskovskaya pravda printed only a summary of his remarks and did 
not make clear whether gorbachev spoke in favor of the restored 
candidacies or scolded party conservatives for attempting to ease 
out reformers 
other politburo members chosen were president andrei a gromyko 
moscow party boss lev n zaikov and premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
defense minister dmitri a yazov a nonvoting politburo member 
also was elected 
more politburo members probably will represent other parts of the 
country foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for instance has 
his communist party base in the southern republic of georgia 
one person not on the list was boris n yeltsin who was 
dismissed as moscow party chief in november after making a speech to 
the national party central committee criticizing the pace of reform 
as too slow the speech still has not been published 
on monday yeltsin took the unprecedented step of using western 
television interviews to call for the resignation of ligachev the 
no 2 man on grounds he is is blocking reform gorbachev denied on 
wednesday that ligachevs removal was a possibility 
ligachev often has appeared more cautious about reform than 
gorbachev and is rumored to lead a conservative faction in the party 
about 5000 delegates are expected to attend the conference

president reagan should be given an honorary 
peerage or similar honor when he leaves office in recognition of his 
contribution to world peace a conservative lawmaker suggested 
saturday 
i think the whole british nation would rejoice if an honor of 
great distinction could be bestowed on him said harry greenway a 
member of prime minister margaret thatchers governing party 
greenway noted other foreigners have been included in britains 
ancient system of honors titles and awards most recently former 
us defense secretary caspar weinberger who received an honorary 
knighthood in february 
i see no reason why arrangements could not be made for an 
honorary peerage to be bestowed on president reagan not only in 
recognition of his unique special relationship with britain but also 
to mark his massive contribution to world peace greenway said 
the angloamerican relationship has flourished under reagan and 
mrs thatcher who have struck a close personal friendship to cement 
their working alliance 
reagan underlined that relationship last week by stopping in 
london on his way home from the moscow summit with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev to give mrs thatcher a briefing reagan leaves 
office in january 
greenway said if reagan were made an honorary peer such 
recognition unique bold and breathtaking would signal how much we 
recognize what this great man has done for world peace 
british peerages formally are awarded by queen elizabeth ii 
although most are made on the prime ministers recommendation 
unlike british peers honorary peers are not entitled to sit in 
the house of lords 
weinberger was the 56th american to receive an honorary 
knighthood 
other americans with the honor include actors douglas fairbanks 
jr and sidney poitier former us ambassador walter annenberg 
former sen william fulbright philanthropists paul mellon and john 
paul getty ii industrialist henry ford iii and dean rusk a former 
secretary of state 
weinberger received his honorary knighthood for being a staunch 
friend to britain remembered most of all for his unfailing support 
and assistance during the falklands war the foreign office said 
at the time 
the united states provided naval intelligence and political 
support to britain during its victory over argentina in a 74day war 
over the falkland islands in the south atlantic

arabs shut down the occupied lands for a second 
day saturday to protest the middle east tour of secretary of state 
george shultz and prime minister yitzhak shamir said he still 
opposes the us peace plan 
israeli soldiers breaking up a protest shot a 55yearold arab 
woman in the hand in the gaza strips nusseirat refugee camp a 
local reporter said the army confirmed the injury and said it was 
investigating the circumstances 
stores were closed and public transport halted in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip where a rebellion against israeli rule 
began six months ago among the 15 million palestinian residents 
the strike also paralyzed arab east jerusalem 
curfews and closures continued for at least six towns and refugee 
camps with 120000 arab residents 
in tel aviv about 5000 israelis marched to support ending the 
occupation in exchange for peace 
fights started when police arrested a woman wearing a dress with 
the design of the palestinian flag which israel has outlawed 
police said eight people were arrested 
there was a problem with the woman who was asked to take the 
flag off her body said a police spokesman whose name was 
withheld in keeping with regulations her friends tried to prevent 
her arrest 
witnesses said police punched and clubbed photographers who took 
pictures of the incident 
witnesses said passersby shouted insults and spat on the marchers 
at shuyukh village near hebron in the west bank about 250 
residents marched in memory of 20yearold mustafa ahmed halaika 
who was shot to death friday members of his family accused young 
jewish settlers of the killing and israeli authorities said they 
were investigating 
an army officer killed another palestinian later friday when 
arabs surrounded and stoned his military patrol in tzafa village 
near ramallah north of jerusalem the army said 
at least 201 palestinians have been killed since riots began dec 
8 in the territories israel captured from jordan and egypt in the 
1967 war a sixday confict that began 21 years ago sunday an 
israeli soldier and a jewish settler also have been slain 
shamir told israel radio he still opposes the us proposal for 
an international peace conference and does not expect a breakthrough 
while shultz is in the region he also opposes trading land for 
peace the other essential part of the american plan 
the prime minister said of shultz he has a very difficult 
mission he is entitled to encouragement but we must be frank with 
him we cant nurture illusions 
he said the secretary on his fourth visit to the middle east in 
five months had undertaken a very ambitious plan shultz began 
his tour friday in cairo visited amman on saturday and is due here 
sunday 
is is known that americans excel in their spirit of optimism 
and we should learn from their optimism but this optimism should 
not blind ones eyes shamir said 
foreign minister shimon peres shamirs partner and rival in the 
tenuous government coalition supports an international conference 
but his political adviser nimrod novik said little could be done 
before israeli elections in november 
shultz should try to sustain the momentum and work on the 
peace package so that once the decision is made by the israeli 
electorate in november the package is ready novik said 
shamir leads the rightwing likud bloc and peres heads the 
centerleft labor party 
the palestinian uprising has become the central election issue 
its underground leaders called the threeday general strike to 
protest the us peace plan because it does not include an 
independent palestinian state 
on saturday leaflets began circulating in the west bank and gaza 
signed by the islamic resistance movement which broke with the 
regular underground leadership earlier this year 
they called june the month of damnation to the occupation and 
declared we should continue the uprising for a long time we 
should not heed any voices calling for ending the uprising or making 
it less important 
palestinians should use stones slingshots sticks molotov 
cocktails and empty hands to resist israeli rule the leaflets 
said 
gen yitzhak mordechai israeli commander in the gaza strip 
urged residents to ignore the war anniversary he promised better 
living conditions and relief from curfews in areas that remain quiet 
and said summer visits from relatives abroad would be forbidden in 
trouble spots

police have evicted hundreds of people 
from their cardboard and tin homes in panama city and ordered them 
to burn the shacks saying the squatters had invaded private 
property 
many of the victims were people who had lost their jobs during 
the past few months as panamas economy went into a tailspin because 
of the political crisis brought on by the confrontation between the 
reagan administration and gen manuel antonio noriega the head of 
panamas defense forces 
we came here because we had nowhere else to go said angelina 
concepcion a mother of two as she gathered some of her few 
belongings early saturday and piled them by the side of a road 
police who began the evictions friday night stood by and watched 
as she worked they refused to talk to journalists and barred 
photographers from the area 
residents said the police ordered them to leave and said the 
shanties would be burned down police then set fire to some of the 
oneroom structures according to the victims 
i made mine out of wood because they told us we could stay if 
we built good homes said evangelista samaniego whose building was 
set ablaze in the open swampy zone 
early saturday crews sent from the company that owns the land and 
trucks from the housing ministry were helping residents move their 
belongings to other areas where some said they were told they could 
rebuild 
housing ministry and company officials were not available for 
comment 
many squatters said they had not been given any notice that they 
would have to leave and had been led to believe they could 
eventually settle in the district they had installed a water pipe 
from the street 
the pipeline was removed by police 
if they wanted the land they could have told us and given us 
some time to move they should not have done it this way said 
leonel mora he said he had moved his family into the area two 
months ago after he lost his job and had to leave a house he rented 
for 50 a month 
many people have lost their jobs and there is a critical 
shortager of money becasuse of the economic sanctions imposed by the 
united states in an effort to force noriega the power behind the 
civilian government to resign and leave panama 
noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in florida in 
february that accused him of drug trafficking the general has 
denied the allegations and rejected the us appeals that he quit as 
head of the 15000member defense forces

iraq reported it attacked a tanker moored 
at an iranian oil terminal saturday and iran claimed its forces 
repelled an iraqi attempt to regain captured land in the northern 
mountains 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia said 
fighterbombers scored a direct and effective hit on a large 
maritime target in the tanker holding area near irans kharg 
island in the northern persian gulf 
the agency quoting a military communique did not identify the 
vessel 
there was no confirmation from gulfbased shipping officials or 
iran 
the iraqi agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the attack 
was part of the campaign to deprive iran of oil revenues used to 
finance its war effort iran and iraq have been at war since 
september 1980 
the air strike was the first iraqi shipping raid reported in 
three weeks the last attack was may 14 when iraqs frenchbuilt 
mirage f1 jets bombed tankers off irans larak island terminal in 
the southern gulf 
five tankers were set ablaze in that raid the 235000ton 
spanish supertanker barcelona later exploded and sank the 
564739ton liberianflagged seawise giant was badly damaged 
irans official islamic republic news agency also monitored in

or wounded 200 iraqi troops in repelling an attack on positions in

angola is threatening peace 
negotiations by massing equipment and soldiers including cubans 
near its border with southwest africa the military said saturday 
the foreign ministry declared earlier in the day that future 
talks must be held in africa and said angola should apologize to the 
congo for trying to change the venue 
angola said thursday the next meetings on peace in angola and 
southwest africa also called namibia would be held in europe 
cuba and the united states also are involved in the talks which 
began may 3 in london their aim is to get foreign soldiers out of 
angola end the civil war there and achieve independence for 
neighboring southwest africa which south africa controls in 
defiance of un resolutions 
on may 18 south africa and angola followed up the previous talks 
with discussions in brazzaville congo and then the argument began 
over a site for future meetings 
the south african military statement saturday spoke of a 
provocative and aggressive buildup of forces in south angola 
which prove the cubans are obviously not displaying any seriousness 
toward the peace negotiations 
some south african troops remain in angola helping 
ussupported rebels fight the marxist government and a cuban force 
of at least 40000 soldiers stationed in the country rebels of the 
national union for the total independence of angola known as unita 
are not involved in the peace talks 
gen jannie geldenhuys south africas military commander said 
may 26 that cuban and angolan troops were moving south toward the 
frontier with southwest africa south african soldiers regularly 
cross into southern angola to attack guerrilla bases of swapo the 
southwest african peoples organization 
in the statement saturday the military said cubans angolans and 
swapo guerrillas had occupied nine more towns near the border 
supported by tanks armored personnel carriers and artillery 
it said swapo used the protection of the cubanangolan buildup to 
move its headquarters closer to the namiobian border 
guerrillas were seen in cuban uniforms and were using vehicles 
disguised as south african to abduct namibian children the 
statement claimed it said whites with long hair which could 
possibly point to russian soldiers or east germans had been 
seen in umfilo 25 miles from the border

during coffee breaks and 
after dinner alone in groups or with their children 
superintendents of americas national parks wandered over to a small 
plaque on the wall of jackson lake lodge during their convention 
which ended sunday 
as they read the congressional mandate that created their agency 
72 years ago they inevitably looked out the floortoceiling 
windows next to the plaque to stare in silence at the majestic teton 
mountains protected forever by a national park 
the purpose of the parks the mandate says is to conserve the 
scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wildlife 
therein and to provide for the same in such manner as will 
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations 
this is what its all about said dick marks chief of grand 
canyon national park in arizona i look out there and im inspired 
to do a better job i look around this room and i know 75 percent of 
the people i have memories of them not as just friends but of 
what theyve accomplished each represents some portion of my 27 
years in the park service 
repeatedly during the first general superintendents conference 
held by the national park service in 12 years park managers 
embraced colleagues they hadnt seen for years and greeted with hugs 
the families of longago coworkers 
the fourday meeting was packed with business sessions 
politicians interior department bureaucrats and experts lecturing 
on issues relevant to running the parks dominated the schedule 
but the gathering called by nps director william penn mott for 
his 342 superintendents 10 regional directors and dozens of 
washington dc staff members was more of a family reunion than a 
business convention 
two young rangers who served with him at the blue ridge parkway 
in june 1961 joined dick marks as top managers at the convention 
these people are more than associates they are family said 
marks a hint of a tear in his eye i will use them as sounding 
boards to help me solve problems when we sit down and talk 
together they remind me of the things that brought me into the 
service the dedication to the mission of protecting our best 
resources 
they were brought together to talk of issues such as planning 
for the 21st century but they were also told to have a good time 
i felt bringing everybody together for inspiration and 
education and for getting acquainted with each other as a total 
national park system would be a highly desirable thing to do for 
the morale of the organization and for the consolidation of our 
commitment said mott 
the 78yearold director who said hes taken three weekends off 
during his threeyear tenure built a free afternoon into the 
schedule so his managers and their families could get outdoors in 
grand teton national park and nearby yellowstone national park 
alan oneill superintendent at lake mead national recreation 
area in arizona and nevada got to take his first rafting trip in 
years 
bob heyder superintendent at mesa verde national park in 
colorado took his wife kathy and daughter gretchen hiking the 
first time the family has taken a walk together in ages said 
his wife 
marks took a sack lunch and sat on a rock then took a walk 
asked to recall the last time he had two hours by himself in the 
outdoors marks thought for a minute then replied i cant 
remember 
chrysandra sandy walter superintendent at lowell national 
historical park in massachussetts said being together in this 
beautiful place has given us time to reflect on what the national 
park service means to the united states and what it stands for in 
the world ive had my family around me including four of the 
ranger recruits i went through basic training with nearly 20 years 
ago who are now superintendents 
robin winks a history professor at yale university and a 
passionate visitor to more than 300 of the 342 units in the system 
told the superintendents thursday you begin to get into a heart 
of a people by what they have chosen to preserve 
mott said americas park stewards are a dedicated corps of 
elite men and women there is an average sixyear wait for a 
seasonal ranger to become a permanent employee within the service 
which has about 16000 fulltime workers the annual turnover rate 
including retirement is 2 percent 
this week has been almost like a religious retreat said 
heyder im going away refreshed and inspired 
like the other superintendents heyder faces a summer of 
anticipated record crowds maintenance problems that include 
everything from overflowing toilets to chuckholes in the roads and 
too much work to do with too little money

about 150 slovenian youths have 
established a committee to help defend a political activist who was 
arrested on suspicion of revealing military secrets a committee 
member said saturday 
he said the committee sent a letter to president raif dizdarevic 
demanding the release of janez jansa who was arrested tuesday in 
ljubljana after reporting alleged plans for a military coup in the 
northern republic of slovenia 
a journalist and one of four candidates for president of the 
slovenian socialist youth union jansa had published a number of 
articles in liberal periodicals criticizing army policies 
in one he said the military planned a coup in slovenia to quell 
dissent in yugoslavias most liberal republic that report was 
denied last week by the government 
a committee member speaking with the condition he not be 
identified told the associated press in a telephone interview from 
ljubljana that jansa has refused to be represented by a military 
lawyer and apparently has decided to defend himself at his trial 
in a statement issued friday the slovenian socialist youth union 
said information about jansas detention was insufficient and 
contradictory which leads us to doubt the correctness of the 
procedure 
the army has said jansa is being held at a military prison but 
has refused to release details about his arrest

just 24 days short of his 80th birthday william 
r schumacher on saturday became the oldest man ordained as a roman 
catholic priest in us history 
schumacher the father of six the grandfather of 13 and the 
greatgrandfather of one became the father of a much larger family 
in a twohour service at his hometown church 
what hes taught all of us is theres nothing you cant do if 
you really want to do it he believes that said fran lipton 48 
schumachers daughter she attended the service with her five 
brothers and several of the new priests grandchildren 
wearing a simple white robe the bespectacled whitehaired 
widower was ordained into the priesthood by bishop thomas tschoepe 
of dallas tschoepe gave schumacher a chance after he was rejected 
by scores of others because of his age 
schumacher shrugged off his historic status which was confirmed 
by the national conference of catholic bishops being a priest is 
all that concerned me he said after the ceremony at st tarcissus 
roman catholic church 
the service culminated a childhood dream for schumacher who 
first took steps to attend a seminary when he was 17 but deferred 
his plans to care for his widowed mother then he got married and 
had a family of his own 
a few weeks after his wife of 52 years genevieve died in 1984 
schumacher telephoned the chicago archdiocese and said he wanted to 
be a priest 
thats when i knew i was released schumacher said i no 
longer had responsibility because the kids were all taking care of 
themselves 
i was then free to do what i originally wanted to do 
but officials in chicago turned him down saying he was 35 years 
beyond the cutoff age of 40 for archdiocesan sponsorship 
after 49 catholic dioceses either rejected or ignored letters 
from schumacher tschoepe promised to give him an assignment in his 
diocese 
tschoepes backing allowed schumacher to enter the seminary and 
in may he graduated from holy apostles seminary in cromwell conn 
bill impresses me as a vigorous man of about 60 or so said 
tschoepe 72 
a man almost 80 years old can be a good priest the bishop 
said with the experience they have they can be very very 
effective especially in counseling and their understanding of what 
other people are going through is one of ive been there 
though he will serve in dallas schumacher requested to be 
ordained in his neighborhood church where he had been a lay leader 
for 31 years 
about 300 people attended the service and scores of parishioners 
lined up in the churchs reception hall afterwards to be blessed by 
the new priest schumacher embraced them onebyone praying 
laughing and talking with them 
as a priest schumachers main responsibilities will be working 
with the elderly and sick people 
schumacher married in 1931 while enrolled in law school but he 
quit his legal studies with less than a year to go because of 
economic responsibilities of caring for a wife and baby during the 
depression 
for the next four decades schumacher pursued various careers in 
chicago including insurance broker politician credit manager and 
job counselor for the state of illinois 
after retiring from his government job at the age of 68 
schumacher became a travel agent a career he continued until he 
applied for the seminary mrs lipton said 
as i was watching the service i thought my mother would have 
been proud to be there but of course if she was there he wouldnt 
have been she said

pigs

neighborhoods and 80 percent of their fathers worked in the fields 
as compared to 45 percent of the fathers in a control group the 
study said 
some community residents say there are more cancer cases and 
that the government was too conservative in assessing the size of 
the cluster 
the cause of the cancer has not been determined the state found 
no evidence to link the problem to water but there is an ongoing 
investigation into field pesticides that were heavily sprayed on the 
fields in 19801982 said the state department of health services 
chavez told the rally the use of the pesticides is the cause 
of all the problems in mcfarland and there is no other cause

those who joined jacksons march were from the ufw and their red 
flags dominated the scene 
chavez said jackson is a good friend and the only candidate 
that will not fudge on issues

with jackson earlier in the week and celebrities including bonnie 
raitt ned beatty margot kidder buffy saintemarie kim fields 
and carl weathers whose movie title action jackson has become

environmental problems in other areas

calling attention to their situation

children who died

this thing said fernando gil a postal clerk from nearby delano 
who said he was undecided whether to vote for jackson or 
frontrunner michael dukakis on tuesday 
jackson has made the mcfarland situation a priority item in his 
campaign in recent days this was his third visit to the town 
he sees the issue as typifying a range of concerns including his 
calls to shift government priorities toward people who have no 
resources pay more attention to safety and health issues improve 
the lot of hispanic field workers and demand responsibility from 
corporations for the environmental and health effects of their 
activities 
jackson told reporters that president reagan vice president 
george bush and the head of the environmental protection agency lee

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis suggested saturday that the reagan administration 
had fumbled an effort to remove panamas gen manuel noriega from 
office by failing to work with allies in the region 
dukakis resuming his campaign schedule after his wifes spinal 
surgery charged there was great anger among leaders of latin 
america democracies over the administrations failure to consult 
them 
three respected former presidents of venezuela costa rica and 
colombia had been working hard together with spain to arrange for 
noriegas departure dukakis said at a news conference to the 
best of my knowledge their efforts were either unnoticed or 
unremarked by the current administration 
their efforts to provide for noriegas departure did not 
succeed as a result dukakis said 
in the final weekend of the 1988 presidential primary campaign 
dukakis edged slowly closer to the magic 2081 delegates needed to 
clinch the democratic nomination the associated press count gave 
him 1811 to jesse jacksons 985 the dukakis campaign is confident 
the four final primaries on tuesday with 466 delegates up for 
grabs will put him over the top 
jackson dukakis only remaining rival campaigned in mcfarland 
calif a largely hispanic city of 6500 that has lost six children 
to cancer jackson called for increased state and federal 
involvement in determining the cause of the mysterious cancers 
jackson also planned a hollywood fundraising gala saturday night 
at a rally in mcfarland jackson called for tighter federal 
restrictions on pesticides that may be carcinogenic saying people 
who work in sprayed fields are being used as guinea pigs 
today in mcfarland we focus on the right to breathe the right 
to drink water the right to a clean environment jackson said at 
a rally 
republican vice president george bush spent the day at home in 
washington before heading to california for a threeday countdown to 
the primary season end 
the massachusetts governor a major advocate of the regional 
peace plan proposed by costa rican president oscar arias called it 
inconceivable for a us administration to fail to talk with 
leaders of those nations if it is serious about promoting democracy 
in the region 
he said their plan involved getting noriega to leave panama and 
go to spain 
he said he did not know details of what went on within the 
administration but said i know from my own consultations with 
latin american leaders that there was no consultation of any 
significance between the administration and the democratically 
elected chiefs of state on this issue 
to the best of my knowledge there has been little or no 
consultation and there is great anger i might add among 
democratically elected chiefs of state in central and south america 
at the failure of our government to consult with them he told 
reporters 
the state department announced two weeks ago that negotiations 
with noriega including the dismissal of drug trafficking charges 
against him had collapsed 
in his first events since his wife kittys operation to repair 
herniated discs in her back dukakis spoke to a rally in a park in 
the shadow of nearby philadelphia by the cooper river where 
pollution has been cleaned up 
dukakis stressed themes of family the environment and of 
combatting drugs all issues the dukakis campaign hopes will appeal 
to suburban swing voters not just in new jerseys primary next 
tuesday but in the fall against republican george bush as well 
i spent a little time with kitty dukakis told the crowd of 
about 400 people she appears to be ok and the operation appears 
to be a success im married to a very strong woman and im proud 
of her shes going to be up and around in the next six to eight 
weeks 
mrs dukakis walked for the first time saturday morning and 
dukakis said her hip where doctors removed bone grafts to place in 
her back was very painful and would be that way for four or 
five days 
mrs dukakis surgery on friday was to replace two herniated 
discs which doctors said if uncorrected could have led to 
paralysis 
the massachusetts governor cited his wifes medical problem in 
his appeal for family values saying crises such as these make a 
person think even more about things that are very precious to us 
one of those things is family 
he cited the cooper river cleanup in stressing that the 
environment would be a budget priority in his administration 
is it going to be star wars or a clean ocean he said 
referring to president reagans nuclear defense initiative

hundreds of birdwatchers 
have gathered in this small island off the scottish coast for a 
glimpse of a rare visitor that is believed to have traveled 6000 
miles from siberia

been recorded in britain before said eric meek an official of 
the royal society for the protection of birds 
the finch which looks like a large brightly colored sparrow 
summers in siberia and winters in southern china and japan 
british birdwatchers are informed about the sighting of unusual 
species by a telephone service named birdline 
more than 300 birdwatchers have come in and we are expecting 
others said meek 
the bird probably was helped along by recent easterly winds said 
kevin woodbridge the bird observatory warden on north ronaldsay an 
island two miles long and three miles wide 55 miles off scotlands 
north coast 
he said a rarely seen spanish sparrow also possibly from eastern 
asia was spotted on the island earlier this week

actor paul newman reflected on his new camp 
for seriously ill children saturday saying the charitable venture 
has helped him regain the enthusiasm of his youth 
im pretty cool newman said during a 35minute interview 
with the associated press at the camp ive seen a lot ive been 
through a lot i lost my cool today i recaptured the enthusiasm 
of my youth this is awesome 
the hole in the wall gang camp a 17 million project including 
the camp facilities and an endowment was initiated by newman in 
1986 and is scheduled to open for children this month 
newmans food company newmans own inc donated 7 million to 
the camp he raised another 7 million from donations ae 
hotchner a business partner and close friend said saturday that 
another 3 million is needed to complete the endowment for the camp 
while the fundraising continues newman is defending against a 
lawsuit by a westport delicatessan owner who claims he was promised 
8 percent of the stock from the food company the plaintiffs lawyer 
accused newman in court in bridgeport friday of misrepresenting a 
profitmkaing food company as a charity newman dismissed the 
allegations as being without merit 
and the money going to the lawyers could have been used for a 
more productive purpose like giving an ambulance to a hospital 
he said 
newman an academy awardwinning actor and race car driver was 
at times quiet at times exuberant as he talked about the camp 
before private dedication ceremonies 
this camp may ultimately be the champ he said of his 
achievements i dont know it just depends on how it goes 
the camp nestled in the woods of northeastern connecticut is 
free for children with lifethreatening diseases ages 7 to 17 
newman said there is still room for more kids 
located on about 300 acres the camp is modeled after a frontier 
logging town of the old wild west 
it will have horseback riding boating a baseball field tennis 
courts a gymnasium dining hall and spacious cabins with sitting 
rooms and front porches golf carts are available for transportation 
around the camp 
newman grew quiet as he talked about one young boy who was 
featured in one of the camps first promotions 
i visited him in boston newman said he didnt make it 
all he wanted to do was toast marshmallows 
the camps name was the one used for a gang of outlaws in the 
movie butch cassidy and the sundance kid which starred newman 
and robert redford 
i prize irreverance newman said of his choice for the name 
newman said he wanted to give the ill children a sense of 
unpressured time through the camp 
you know time is the major ingredient that gives you the 
opportunity to leave a mark he said and thats the least of 
what these kids have theyve never been given the gift of time 
its always living on the edge for them

mary poppins wouldnt recognize todays 
chimney sweeps they carry hightech breathing masks power tools 
and even video cameras said an organizer of a weekend convention of 
chimney sweeps here 
gone are the longstick brushes and literary images of young boys 
with sootsmudged cheeks and long black coats climbing on rooftops 
said clint bernard president of the north carolina guild of 
professional chimney sweeps 
the countrys estimated 5500 sweeps are getting serious about 
their business and they want people to know it 
were trying to get away from the cutesy image bernard said 
at the charlotte hotel where chimney sweeps from 11 states were 
gathered for the guilds ninth annual convention people should 
be looking for credentials not somebody wearing a top hat and 
tails and looking like they walked out of a dickens novel 
the tophatandtails image hearkens to 19th century europe when 
sweeps wore the fancy garb to distinguish themselves as masters of 
their craft bernard said 
the fourday convention which attracted about 180 sweeps from as 
far away as texas and new york runs through sunday with seminars 
speeches and a trade show where merchants displayed the latest in 
chimney cleaning devices 
chimney sweeps avoid the rooftop settings where actor dick van 
dyke playing a sweep danced in the movie mary poppins bernard 
said instead they generally clean chimneys through the fireplace 
using brushes attached to polyurethane expandable poles 
they also wear special fireproof jackets shirts and hats and don 
fullface respiratory masks when needed to avoid inhaling clouds of 
soot he said 
about half own closedcircuit video cameras which are extended 
on long poles into the flue to peer into corners and detect other 
problem spots a sweep cannot see bernard said 
electric rotor tools with whirling discs and highpowered vacuums 
help finish the job he said

this coastal community may lose its 
town hall and other property to foreclosure because it cant afford 
to pay off a 140000 settlement to the daughter of a man killed by 
town police four years ago 
ive never heard of a situation like this said deputy 
secretary of state john stokes 
donnie riggins 20 was shot at a restaurant in 1984 by a 
parttime town police officer running to catch a suspect smoking a 
marijuana cigarette the death was ruled accidental but the town 
agreed last year to pay riggins daughter 140000 in an 
outofcourt settlement the decision came just moments before a 
federal court was to hear a wrongful death lawsuit 
the town had no liability insurance at the time of the shooting 
after paying the first three installments totaling 15000 the 
town fell behind on a courtmandated schedule a 50000 payment was 
due aug 2 1987 but attorneys for riggins daughter tyanna m 
vaught aged 3 at the time of the shooting said the town has not 
paid 
in january us district judge c weston houck ordered the town 
to put up its property as collateral that includes the town hall 
community center and fire station 
lawyers for riggins daughter said they will begin foreclosure on 
the property within two weeks attorney fayrell furr jr said friday 
he will seek foreclosure unless the town pays the balance of the 
settlement 125000 
its imminent said attorney john leiter who also represents 
the little girl the family doesnt want to cause atlantic beach 
any undue hardship theyre just asking atlantic beach to live up 
the agreement reached in court 
mayor joe montgomery was reluctant to discuss the debt but he 
said he believes atlantic beach wont lose any property 
its highly unprobable well lose anything because of the 
options we have montgomery said he declined to say what the 
options were except that they didnt involve a tax increase 
a council member who said she did not know of montgomerys plans 
sullivan said no other funds have been available since the town was 
able to make the 15000 payment through property tax revenues 
if we had the money we would have paid fannie sullivan said 
with a per capita income in 1983 of 4553 atlantic beach is one 
of the poorest towns in the state 
current appraised values werent available for the community 
center or the singlestory brick town hall which also holds the 
police department the community center was estimated in 1986 to be 
worth 42000

nations that fought in the battle of normandy will 
mark the 44th anniversary of dday on monday by opening a museum 
dedicated to world peace 
instead of rusty tanks and yellowing propaganda posters the 
mammoth glassandstone memorial outside the city of caen will house 
multimedia exhibits that stress the lessons of world war ii as much 
as the battle itself 
the museum includes a research center with computerized access to 
war archives in france and overseas a film and photography archive 
and six exhibits that explain the development of the war from its 
origins in the postworld war i period 
french president francois mitterrand will inaugurate the memorial 
outside the normandy town on monday 
caen mayor jeanmarie girault said his objective in building the 
museum was to stress the fight against fascism not to glorify 
battlefield victories us rep sam gibbons dfla a supporter of 
the project concurred in an interview saturday 
although we were fighting battles over real estate the war was 
really about ideological matters said gibbons who parachuted 
behind german lines during the invasion and is the only normandy 
veteran still serving in congress 
he said the museum would show the whys of the 
disintegration of the world after world war i 
allied forces landed along an 80mile front of normandy coastline 
on june 6 1944 more than 3 million soldiers fought for 76 days 
during which 367000 men died or were wounded the allied triumph 
crushed nazi forces in france and marked a turning point in the war

a church of england clergyman who publishes 
information about the state of religion in communist countries said 
saturday he had been refused a visa to the soviet union for the 
fifth time 
the rev michael bourdeaux said he was barred from taking 
pilgrims to the 1000th anniversary celebrations of the founding of 
christianity in russia which start sunday 
it refusal of visa makes one call into question whether the 
reforms in the soviet union are as genuine as they appear to be on 
the surface bourdeaux told independent radio news 
bourdeaux 54 who studied at moscow state university in 195960 
founded the keston college center for the study of religion and 
communism near london in 1969 the center publishes frequent 
information on communist persecution of religious believers 
bourdeaux was awarded the 1984 templeton prize for progress in 
religion founded by sir john m templeton a multimillionaire 
usborn investment counselor who lives in nassau bahamas 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual head of the 
anglican state church flew to moscow on saturday with a party of 
british churchmen to attend the ceremonies 
speaking to reporters at londons heathrow airport runcie said 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness 
is in part responsible for the extent of the celebrations 
its something that is deep in the russian spirit the whole 
history of russia is impregnated with christianity he said 
but it would not be taking place on this scale and it would not 
be taking place with an element of participation from the general 
public and indeed from state officials if there were not a new 
policy he added

at least eight members of an informal group 
distributing meese is a pig posters have been ticketed or 
arrested in the past month for posting the signs critical of the 
attorney general an organizer of the project said saturday 
the signs aimed at edwin meese iii read experts agree meese is 
a pig and have appeared around the washington area on traffic 
signal boxes fences buildings and in public transportation areas 
organizer mark andersen 28 of arlington va said about 60 
people many of them punk rock musicians and their friends are 
involved in the project 
he said the informal group objects to meeses law enforcement and 
civil rights policies and believes his conduct in the irancontra 
investigation and his dealings with scandalplagued wedtech corp 
are grounds for ouster 
he said the group is voicing its opposition to meese with 
creativity and with humor 
four people were arrested in arlington for posting signs on 
county property and four others have been ticketed in the district 
of columbia in the past month for their role in posting the 
antimeese signs police officials confirmed 
andersen said secret service officers followed him and pulled him 
over for driving a car with faulty brake lights in midmay after he 
picked up some poster supplies left in a parking lot 
secret service spokesman richard adams said the departments 
officers have the same rights as district of columbia police to stop 
traffic violators but he had no information on andersens case 
andersen said he subsequently was contacted about the posters by 
the fbi and has asked the bureau to submit its questions to him in 
writing 
i cant understand it at all other than that theyre trying to 
intimidate me he said 
fbi spokesman harry mount had no comment 
both the posters and tshirts bearing the same slogan are part of 
a local grassroots effort to bring about meeses resignation 
andersen said 
common concerns a washington bookstore has sold about 150 of 
the tshirts in the past two months said bookstore employee linda

rubberworkers in des moines approved a 
proposed contract with firestone inc on saturday putting it close 
to ratification in the final weekend of voting on a pact that 
affects about 4700 workers in six states 
one union official said that after years of concessions were 
getting something back 
the tentative agreement ended a weeklong strike against 
firestone that began may 15 and it was in line with a master 
contract negotiated by the united rubber workers union and the 
goodyear tire amp rubber co on may 17 
votes were scheduled sunday by urw members at firestone plants at 
akron ohio and noblesville ind and approval by either one would 
result in ratification of the threeyear pact said curt brown a 
spokesman at urw headquarters at akron 
ron smiley president of local 310 at des moines said saturdays 
approval already gave the contract support of a majority of the urw 
members working for firestone but union rules also require approval 
by a majority of the locals 
earlier the pact was approved by locals at decatur ill and 
russellville ark but it was turned down at oklahoma city 
in des moines the proposal was approved by a 398258 vote at a 
plant with more than 1400 workers smiley said 
smiley said there was some dissension in iowa because even with 
raises some workers would not catch up with past concessions 
however he said im glad its over its not a bad package 
the iowa workers had made wage and benefit concessions to keep 
their factory open in 1982 1985 and 1987 
now weve reversed that trend and were getting a little 
something back smiley said 
he said that with employment climbing at des moines japans 
bridgestone corp taking over firestone and a new contract 
apparently approved were in good shape 
an average firestone worker at the six plants earns 1250 an 
hour according to the union the proposed contract with firestone 
would provide a 25centanhour increase but it would be considered 
an advance that would be deducted from future costofliving raises 
in increments of no more than 10 cents a year

a sunday newspaper reported the 18 foreign hostages 
kidnapped in lebanon are being held in a former school in south 
beirut and it carried a frontpage photograph of a building it said 
was the school 
the mail on sunday said the hostages including nine americans 
and three britons were taken there during recent fighting in the 
area between gunmen of the proiranian hezbollah organization and 
shiite amal militiamen 
hezbollah or party of god is believed holding the captives 
the mail on sunday attributed its report to amal officers it did 
not identify 
in other developments 
londons guardian newspaper said the united states is holding 
talks with hezbollah leaders in lebanon and directly with iranian 
representatives in geneva in another effort to gain the release of 
the hostages it based its report on information from unidentified 
political sources in beirut 
the british foreign office said saturday it has proposed paying 
iran the equivalent of more than 32 million as compensation in a 
settlement over damages to british diplomatic buildings in iran and 
irans embassy in london 
a foreign office spokesman who was not identified in line with 
government practice said the proposal is to be discussed at a 
meeting in london starting wednesday but the talks will not cover 
the question of the british hostages in lebanon 
of the nine american captives terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press has been held the longest 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
many previous published reports on where the hostages were being 
held and about talks to gain their release turned out to be 
unfounded 
the mail on sunday said the captives are being guarded at the 
school by high ranking hezbollah officers supervised by iranian 
revolutionary guards 
it said amal militiamen have infiltrated hezbollah and quoted one 
amal fighter as describing the school where it said the hostages are 
held 
the newspaper said militiaman abu abass was interrogated by 
hezbollah members at the building the former azariyeh primary 
school 
reporters in beirut said they knew of an azariyeh primary school 
located in the southern suburbs of beirut but they did not how it is 
being used 
the newspaper quoted abass as saying the tunnels and 
passageways have recently been excavated and a ventilation system 
has been installed the whole area has been partitioned into tiny 
cells 
abass also said a doctor occasionally goes to the school 
accompanied by guards 
the mail on sunday quoted other amal officers as saying we 
know they the hostages are there and that they are alive but any 
attempt to take them by force will only result in bloodshed 
the dim frontpage photo showed what appeared to be part of a 
onestory building with sandbags at strategic points 
in its article the guardian said the purported talks in lebanon 
and geneva were not expected to produce quick results for the 
american hostages but to accelerate as the american 
presidential elections approach in november 
it said the united states is thought to be seeking a package 
deal that also would involve church of england envoy terry waite 
who was in lebanon trying to arrange the release of the foreign 
hostages when he disappeared on jan 20 1987 
the foreign office spokesman said the british proposal on 
settlement of damages to diplomatic buildings was first made in may 
1987 britain has said repeatedly that it will make no deals to gain 
the release of the hostages 
the spokesman said the iranian representatives at wednesdays 
meeting will only be considering the questions of damage to irans 
embassy at londons princes gate which caught fire when british 
commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege and damage to 
british diplomatic offices in tehran and elsewhere in iran 
british government buildings and the british embassy were damaged 
by mobs in 1978 1979 and 1980 
we want compensation for the damage to our property in iran and 
we want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the princes 
gate property which is a health hazard and an eyesore the 
spokesman said 
he said under the proposal britain would pay iran about 18 
million pounds 324 million and iran would pay britain about 
about 900000 pounds 162 million 
a series of diplomatic explusions has left just one british 
official in tehran and one iranian official in london

a dredge vessel sank in a river 
channel saturday and was leaking thousands of gallons of oil that 
spread over more than a mile threatening beaches and sensitive 
marshlands officials said 
the 168foot vessel was dredging the st marys river channel 
which straddles the georgiaflorida line when waves crashed over 
its bow causing it to flood and sink said capt robert opezio of 
the us coast guard the onscene coordinator 
the people on board ended up in the water said dave kelly a 
coast guard damage control officer they didnt have time to get 
off 
seven crew members from the dredge were plucked from the water as 
it sank near the entrance to the 50foot deep channel he said the 
ship held 40000 gallons of diesel fuel and was leaking about 500 
gallons an hour 
john spendlove a crewmember aboard a navy tug was injured in 
the rescue effort and was in satisfactory condition at university 
hospital in jacksonville said judi skelton a hospital spokeswoman 
from a helicopter an oil slick could be seen drifting into the 
atlantic ocean and pushing southward about a mile from fernandina 
beach opezio said the slick extended at least a mile from the 
dredge and was at least a mile wide 
choppy seas were breaking the fuel into streaks which drifted 
two to three miles west into the st marys river in the direction of 
the sensitive cumberland sound and amelia river wetland areas no 
fuel appears to have entered those areas yet opezio said 
to prevent the fuel from spreading further the owner of the 
dredge hired an oil containment contractor to erect floating 
containment booms at the entrances of creeks and tributaries 
extending from the channel

crews with siphon hoses worked along a 
creek saturday to clean up some 128000 gallons of oil that 
officials said caused no serious environmental damage 
bob wimmer assistant fire chief in the milwaukee suburb of 
wauwatosa said the heating oil poured from a twofoot hole in an 
underground pipe for 18 minutes before pumps were shut down the 
leak was discovered early saturday 
the leaks cause was unclear wimmer said 
residents who reported an oil odor were told it carried no health 
hazard dean kelley spill coordinator for the state department of 
natural resources said the fumes were the same as those when fuel 
is being fed to a dwellings furnace tank 
oil traveled about five miles through underwood creek into the 
menomonee river a tributary of lake michigan authorities said no 
oil reached the lake harbor 
underwood creek is lined with concrete which should prevent 
contamination to drinking water ground water or private wells and 
would protect wildlife from serious damage said doug hoskins a 
conservation warden with the state department of natural resources 
the spill was one of the bigger ones weve had in the area for 
some time if not the biggest hoskins said 
fish in underwood creek primarily are small minnows and chubs 
hoskins said he said he had heard waterfowl were nesting along the 
banks but he found no injured or dead birds 
i think we got off lucky hoskins said 
kelley said temporary dams 100 feet upstream and 100 feet 
downstream from the spill site on underwood creek would contain the 
bulk of the oil and simplify the use of siphon hoses to pump the 
fluid into storage tanks

workers intensified the search 
saturday for survivors of a powerful mine blast after rescuing six 
men who survived 65 hours in an underground air pocket 
the rescue came with the help of a television crews microphone 
that picked up tapping sounds when it was lowered into a mineshaft 
a west german television station early sunday quoted one of the 
six survivors as saying rescuers unknowingly made radio contact with 
them hours after the explosion on wednesday 
the rescuers apparently thought the six were with the teams 
searching for 57 people missing after the blast the television said 
all 57 had been given up for dead late saturday a 37th body was 
recovered fourteen other miners were still missing 
officials said the miners were trapped about 500 feet underground 
in an air pocket away from carbon monoxide estimated at 50 times the 
level fatal to humans 
its a miracle said petercarl ruehland a spokesman for 
preussen elektra the company that owns the coal mine 
heinz cramer a spokesman for the mine owner said the men were 
in an area which was about to run out of oxygen and time was 
running out when they were found 
another survivor mine supervisor thomas gepperth said 
everybody was making their last wills and testaments i told them 
they didnt have to 
gepperth saved the men by leading them away from the carbon 
monoxide gas the supervisor told hesse state television 
zdf television said a turkish survivor ahmet batkan told the 
network the radio contact occurred hours after the blast wednesday 
the buried miners had given their position on a radio the 
television reported batkan as saying they were then told not to 
use the radio again in order not to disturb other signals 
at first they stopped using the radio and when they tried 
again they were not able to make contact the television said 
officials could not be immediately reached to comment on the 
television report 
but on the day of the accident borken mayor bernd hessler told 
reporters of radio contact with a group of miners who reported 
themselves uninjured but other officials said later in the day that 
the contact was made with other rescuers 
another survivor also interviewed on state television but not 
identified by name described hearing drilling on friday followed 
by silence 
that was really agonizing because nothing more was going on up 
there you start thinking have they forgotten us or something 
maybe theyre figuring its not worth it he said 
searchers some with tears in their eyes broke into applause as 
the exhausted but otherwise unhurt survivors reached the surface 
the dramatic rescue sparked hopes for finding more survivors 
inside the stolzenbach mine 
its a faint hope but a supervisor said there were tracks of 
two people who may also be in an area where they may have 
survived said cramer a board member of preussen elektra were 
stepping up the search 
you can certainly call gepperths actions something special he 
reacted in exactly the right way cramer added 
he said about 200 workers were involved in the search in borken 
a town of 15000 people 70 miles northeast of frankfurt 
family members who rushed to the scene embraced the five west 
germans and one turk fourteen turkish immigrant workers were among 
the 57 trapped miners 
the six survivors later paused for photographers but told 
reporters not to ask them any questions 
they were examined at nearby hospitals then allowed to go home 
cramer told reporters the six were found in a deadend tunnel 
about 10 feet wide and eight feet high 
the rescue came after crews drilled an air shaft in the east 
field of the mine officials said that carbon monoxide levels 
registered lower there than in the north field where they were 50 
times higher than the amount lethal for humans 
rescuers had believed that all 13 miles of underground shafts 
were filled with such high levels of carbon monoxide that no one 
could be found alive 
but friday night rescuers detected tapping sounds through the 
air shaft and tried to verify them with a stethoscope a television 
cameraman suggested lowering a microphone which picked up the 
trapped men saying they have drilled a hole 
early saturday the microphone detected regular tapping sounds 
after more than three hours of digging the rescue workers broke 
into the air pocket and found the men 
some victims relatives criticized the rescue efforts saying 
they believed the retrieval of bodies had been given priority over 
the search for survivors they also said they could not understand 
why workers didnt think to use a microphone earlier 
company and state officials staunchly defended the rescue 
operation 
when the group felt the shock wave of the blast wednesday cramer 
said they ran toward an exit but gepperth 36 a veteran miner and 
trained rescuer realized they were running into high concentrations 
of deadly carbon monoxide when he saw another man staggerering 
gepperth turned the group in the other direction and instructed 
them to be as calm as possible to conserve oxygen cramer said 
many of the confirmed fatalities died of carbon monoxide 
poisoning 
in addition to gepperth and batkan company officials identified 
the survivors as egon dehn helmut gesner heinz roese and wilfried 
doench they range in age from 21 to 36 
a man who identified himself as dehns brotherinlaw said the 
six men had kept up their hopes by talking about the miracle of 
lengede 
that was a reference to a 1963 mining disaster in the lower 
saxony iron ore mine of lengede when 11 miners were found alive two 
weeks after water flooded the mine twentynine miners died in that 
accident 
the borken explosion is the worst west german mining accident 
since 299 men died in 1962 at the luisenthal mine in saarland state 
along the border with france

static electricity no one was injured by the detonation 
ziolkowski died in 1982 at age 74 but his wife and eight of 
their 10 children have continued working to shape the mountain 
crazy horse helped lead the indians who defeated gen george

fellow chiefs and i would like the white man to know the red man had 
great heroes too chief henry standing bear wrote in a letter 
asking ziolkowski to carve the monument

thirtysix undocumented mexican aliens were 
found saturday wandering without food or water in the searing sonora 
desert north of tucson after two of them came to a ranch seeking 
help authorities said 
the 35 men and one woman whom officials said had been walking 
four days since crossing the border onto the tohono oodham indian 
reservation were brought to northwest hospital by border patrol bus 
the 36 were in generally good condition said nursing supervisor 
cheryl lanier three men were treated for dehydration and the rest 
were simply given drinks and a chance to cool off in the hospitals 
cafeteria said emergency room services director ardis waite 
after treatment all 36 were returned to the custody of the 
border patrol ms lanier said 
those in good physical condition who wanted to return to mexico 
would be allowed to do so voluntarily said border patrol 
supervisory agent clyde j benzenhoefer 
the mexicans ranging in age from 18 to about 50 all came from 
the state of oaxaca and crossed probably from the town of san 
miguel sonora south of sells ariz benzenhoefer said 
he said they had told officials they were en route to look for 
farm work probably near phoenix had been traveling mostly at night 
and had run out of water friday afternoon or saturday morning 
benzenhoefer said the group was found about 3 pm he said the 
group had located runoff water near the silverbell branch mine 
operated by the asarco co about 60 miles north of the mexican 
border and about 20 miles northwest of tucson where the temperature 
reached 108 degrees saturday 
they had just found it when we got to em apparently they 
would have kept on going if we hadnt found them he said 
they were probably in pretty bad shape i would imagine it was 
110 degrees out in the desert today benzenhoefer said 
he said all but three men had crossed in one group he said the 
three came across the rest on saturday 
both groups were out of water and two of the three went to a 
rancher about four or five miles from the mine and asked for help 
the rancher notified the pima county sheriffs authorities who in 
turn called the border patrol benzenhoefer said 
he said none of the mexicans had acknowledged having a coyote or 
paid guide who smuggles undocumented aliens across the border 
none of them have identified him yet if they did im sure they 
did have somebody that guided them across benzenhoefer said and 
added that it was possible one of the group could be a coyote he 
also said a coyote might have cut off from the group upon seeing 
the border patrol approaching 
he said the route was a common one for illegal border crossings 
last summer us border patrol agents said about 70 bodies since 
1980 had been found in the sonora desert area

a study of nearly 1600 pregnant women found that 
those who used video display terminals for more than 20 hours each 
week in the first three months of pregnancy suffered almost twice as 
many miscarriages as women who did not according to a published 
report 
the findings did not necessarily mean that the terminals 
themselves had caused the miscarriages said the authors of the 
study researchers at the kaiserpermanente medical care program in 
oakland calif 
the new york times reported in its sunday editions that such 
unmeasured factors as jobrelated stress and poor working conditions 
could also have been responsible 
the results of the study appear in the june issue of the american 
journal of industrial medicine the researchers called for more 
elaborate studies 
the researchers found that heavy users of vdts were more likely 
to have children with birth defects but the increase was not 
statistically significant the researchers said 
the findings were the first epidemiological evidence based on 
substantial numbers of pregnant vdt operators to show a 
statistically significant increase of miscarriages among those who 
use the terminals more than 20 hours a week the times said 
some experts have suggested that lowlevel electromagnetic 
radiation from vdts may be able to alter or disrupt cellular 
development 
about 15 million vdts are in use in the united states and about 3 
million more are added annually according to the vdt news an 
industry newsletter about half the estimated 10 million people who 
use the machines on the job are women of childbearing age the 
times said 
the researchers surveyed 1583 pregnant women in northern 
california 
the study found increased risks of miscarriage in both the first 
and second trimesters of pregnancy for all women who worked with 
video display terminals for more than 20 hours a week no 
statistically significant increase was found for women who had used 
the terminals less than 20 hours a week the researchers said 
preliminary results of a university of michigan study of 728 
state employees in michigan released last september found that 
pregnant women working at vdts less than 20 hours a week faced no 
increased risk of miscarriage

senior health service officials who gathered at a private meeting in 
charlottesville va to plan a federal response to the aids 
epidemic the newspapers reported 
the boldest proposal at the conference according to several key 
participants interviewed by the times was a call by the drug abuse 
working group for a large increase in the quantity and quality of 
treatment programs for intravenous drug users 
according to drug abuse professionals who heard the panels 
summation the times said experts from the national institute on 
drug abuse recommended that the number of slots in drug abuse 
treatment programs be boosted from the current level of 148000 up 
to 380000 to serve roughly a third of all the nations drug abusers 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it

the government said saturday its investigations 
have not produced evidence that an opposition politician received 
funds from the us government 
former solicitor general francis seow was arrested on may 6 under 
the internal security act and accused of subversive activities the 
government subsequently claimed he had received money from us 
sources to oppose prime minister lee kuan yews peoples action 
party that has governed singpaore since 1959 
singapore expelled a us diplomat in the dispute 
a statememt issued by the home affairs ministry said the 
investigation showed seow had received the equivalent of 425000 
from foreigners but it was unable to identify the contributors 
it said the internal security department had not been able to 
interview people outside singapore about seows finances and added 
this is insufficient to determine whether seow has received 
money from any foreign powers or their agents the results therefore 
remain inconclusive 
last month the government claimed that e mason hendrickson a 
first secretary at the us embassy had tried to persuade seou and 
several other prominent lawyers to run against candidates of the 
peoples action party in general elections in the early 1990s 
the government expelled hendrickson washington denied the 
allegations and in turn expelled robert chua first secretary of 
singapores embassy in washington 
under the constitution parliamentary elections must be held 
within five years and the mandate for the peoples action party 
will expire in december 1989

across california saturday hoping to pick the winning numbers in a 
national record jackpot estimated at 512 million 
by the time the drawing took place saturday night the odds of 
winning were about one in 14 million said state lottery officials 
as usual lottery computers will not determine whether anyone has 
won the jackpot until sunday a winner would not be verified until 
monday 
ticket sales on saturday alone reached more than 33 million a 
oneday all time high lottery spokesman bob taylor said 
at 4 pm our ticket sales pushed the lotto prize past 46 
million he said past the pennsylvania record 
the nations previous richest lottery prize 46 million was 
awarded in pennsylvania in october the biggest previous california 
jackpot 254 million was split by two players in october 
theres no way we could have predicted anything like this 
taylor said in releasing the anticipated sum and a statement from 
lottery director chon gutierrez calling sales a phenomenal tidal 
wave 
many stores brought in extra help to keep up with ticket sales 
i cannot handle it too many people said paul lee owner of 
the new lun wah grocery store in san franciscos chinatown where 50 
people lined up for tickets saturday morning 
its been crazy said alex lichine manager of lichines 
liquor deli and catering store in sacramento its going to get 
worse everybodys playing today everybodys playing four or five 
times more than normal 
ticket buyers forked over dollars at the rate of 2 million per 
hour statewide said lottery spokesman john schade 
a player beating the 1in14 million odds of winning the jackpot 
which began growing when there were no winners in several previous 
drawings of the lotto 649 game would receive the money after 
federal taxes in an annuity paid over 20 years 
the actual size of the jackpot depended on how many tickets were 
sold 
the winning numbers six of 49 were picked in a 756 pm 
drawing in sacramento they were 48 42 9 14 19 31 the bonus 
number was 37 
i tell you the skys the limit today we had almost 5 million 
in ticket sales at 10 oclock today said taylor last 
saturday at this time we had 904000 these figures are just mind 
boggling 
as the game heated up a los angeles psychologist cautioned 
players not to fall victim to what he called lottery fantasy 
syndrome 
people purchase a ticket ignore the odds and start thinking of 
the impossible quitting their jobs buying items that they have 
always wanted going places that they have never been and some even 
think of divorcing their spouses and starting their lives completely 
over said robert butterworth 
the jackpot lured players across state and national borders 
leo gronich owner of garlans inc a calexico department store 
with a currency exchange said some players were mexicans trading 
pesos for tickets oregon residents drove south to yreka calif 
for tickets said clerk dan jerden at sports and spirits 
at tahoe toms in south lake tahoe the fat pot drew nevada 
residents across the border three blocks away 
we were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the 
ticket line up to the state line and have the casino executives 
wonder whats going on said owner tom erickson 
what to do with the enormous sum 
party forever said leslie beagle 43 of riverside as she 
plunked down 10 for her shot at the jackpot 
youd probably have to take six months off to think about it 
said bill masterson 46 of south lake tahoe who planned to buy

shortly after castro took power in 1959 and have resisted political 
indoctrination the times said castro said the 44 were convicted of

a federal judge on friday cleared the way for 
government testing of a highpowered electrical generator designed 
to simulate one of the effects of a nuclear explosion the navy 
said 
navy spokeswoman lt janet mescus said us district judge john 
garrett penn on friday refused to extend a temporary restraining 
order he had issued on tuesday a day before testing originally had 
been set to begin 
following penns decision friday not to extend the restraining 
order mescus said testing from the navys empress ii barge would 
begin monday the tests are planned for international waters about 
15 miles off the virginianorth carolina coast 
although the pentagon had scaled down electromagnetic pulse or 
emp research facilities and conducted an environmental assessment 
to settle a suit brought by the foundation on economic trends the 
environmental group argued in court that a second study was 
necessary 
the empress barge is equipped with two diesel generators and a 
huge antenna system capable of sending pulses of electrical 
power into the atmosphere at power levels up to 7 million volts to 
test the emp phenomenon 
each pulse lasts only a billionth of a second and the navy 
maintains the testing will have no effect on human or marine life 
electromagnetic pulse is a powerful wave or surge of 
electrical energy that is released by a nuclear explosion and which 
can travel long distances through the atmosphere or water

even before salvadoran president jose napoleon 
duarte learned he was suffering from cancer the reagan 
administration was concerned that the special relationship it had 
forged with el savador under duartes leadership could begin to wane 
duarte has been a favorite of republicans and democrats alike in 
the congress and since his election four years ago el salvador has 
received 15 billion in us economic aid and 455 million in 
military aid levels unmatched elsewhere in latin america 
but duartes christian democratic party is deeply split raising 
the clear possibility that victory in the 1989 presidential 
elections may go to the rightist arena party which made a strong 
showing in legislative elections last march 
duarte was already a lame duck president when according to us 
officials he learned that the cancer which has affected his liver 
and stomach is terminal the only question is how long he will 
live said one official adding that his survival may only be a 
matter of months spokesmen at walter reed army hospital where 
duarte has been confined since wednesday have discussed duartes 
condition only in general terms

as mystifying as it may have seemed to many 
people last weeks rally in the stock market came as no outlandish 
surprise to analysts who monitor a phenomenon they call investor 
sentiment 
to these observers it didnt matter much that there seemed to 
be no plausible economic reason for the dow jones average of 30 
industrials to jump 7468 points on tuesday and 3289 more on 
wednesday after several weeks of going nowhere 
regardless of what was happening to interest rates or economic 
growth the statistics they follow suggested the mood of the market 
had grown so gloomy prices had virtually no place to go but up 
one popular gauge of sentiment in the marketplace is a tally of 
investment advisory services kept by investors intelligence of new 
rochelle ny 
as of may 27 the firm calculated that 549 percent of the 130 
market forecasting services it monitors took a bearish view of the 
outlook against just 298 percent in the bullish camp 
the remaining 153 percent were classified as looking for a 
correction or shortterm decline 
that put the percentage of bears at higher levels even than in 
the period immediately following the crash last fall indeed at 
an extreme not seen since the summer of 1982 or just before the 
market took off on its fiveyear rally 
the rationale for tracking sentiment in ways like this arises 
from the inherently contrary nature of the stock market 
when everyone has turned negative about prospects for stock 
prices the logic runs there is nobody left to sell and depress 
prices further so the next shift in expectations is likely to be 
in a positive direction 
conversely market advances most often top out in times of 
widespread euphoria when everybody with money to invest has 
already bought stocks 
says investors intelligence in its weekly reports since most 
advisory services are trend followers they are most bearish at 
market bottoms and least bearish at market tops 
however much faith they may put in an indicator like this most 
analysts generally acknowledge that it is no surefire key to 
unlocking the mysteries of the market 
in september and october 1981 for example the percentage of 
bears ran consistently above 50 percent but it wasnt until almost 
a year later in august 1982 that stocks pulled out of an extended 
bear market and began a historic rise to new highs 
furthermore a good many analysts who believed the recent 
investors intelligence data were signaling an impending rally 
arent persuaded that the advance will last very long 
stan weinstein publisher of the advisory letter professional 
tape reader said in a may 27 commentary that an oversold rally 
should soon set in 
but taking a longer perspective weinstein maintained the 
major bear market that began in late august is still in force 
charles laloggia a rochester ny investment adviser said he 
believed the sentiment data indicated that a strong bear market 
rally is in store for the stock market 
it is possible analysts say to keep a weather eye on measures 
of investor sentiment while not abandoning the belief that interest 
rates corporate profits and other fundamentals are important 
forces in the ups and downs of the stock market 
faith in the stock markets ability to function efficiently to 
discount investor concerns is not the same as pretending that the 
problems do not exist said robert salomon at salomon brothers 
inc 
the pace of economic growth political uncertainties and the 
durability of the financial system are serious issues with 
important implications for stock prices 
at current levels however we believe that market valuations 
reflect a high level of investor skepticism about whether or not 
any of these problems can be contained or avoided

if you fancy antiques stay away from the 
shop two young cousins inherited from a mysterious uncle if youre 
into horror come in and browse 
friday the 13th a series of slice n dice movies has been 
turned into a syndicated television show that offers its own little 
shop of horrors 
my cousin and i inherited the store from our uncle louis who 
had made a pact with the devil for immortality said the actress 
robey who stars as micki foster what he didnt realize was that 
the devil cursed every object in the store the show deals with 
greed good and evil 
when uncle louis tried to back out of his deal he fell to 
hell he left us the store and every week we have to find those 
objects that are cursed its the ageold problem of temptation i 
think we were put on earth to resist temptation you have to love 
god those objects are the antithesis of that 
robey she goes professionally by her last name also stars 
with john d lemay who plays her cousin ryan and christopher 
wiggins who plays an eccentric dealer in antiquities named jack 
marshak 
each episode they must fight to recover an object that has taken 
possession of its owner the owners want the objects because of the 
power they give them a television newsman for instance uses an 
antique camera to create a duplicate of himself the duplicate 
commits a series of murders and the newsmans ratings soar because 
hes always one step ahead of everyone else 
micki is a classic overachiever said robey shes 
completely controlled by the system shes been sheltered her whole 
life now she gets thrown into these situations like anything 
through struggle comes grace shes learning to be her own person 
and learning what she likes or more important what she doesnt 
like 
robey had virtually no experience in film or television when she 
won the role in friday the 13th the series by beating out 300 
other women who auditioned 
we have wonderful guest actors that i get to meet and work 
with she said these are people who have been acting for 30 
40 years and its a great opportunity for me to learn as a person 
and as an actress i get to know other peoples life experiences 
she was born louise robey in canada her father was a pilot in 
the royal canadian air force her mother had been a london stage 
actress she grew up in canada west germany italy england 
scotland and france she was educated at a boarding school in 
scotland that has academic connections with oxford university 
they bring you up to believe youll go to university or go 
into business she said its not conducive to the arts but 
traveling around makes you a citizen of the world 
i moved around so much when i was growing up that its in my 
blood she said i enjoy moving around i dont like to be in 
one place too long a fantasy of mine is that i have gobs of old 
friends i grew up with and that i can call up but i do have many 
new friends 
robey started out with a dual career as a singer and a model 
ive sung for the last 10 years she said i cut my first 
record at 17 in europe i had a rock band called robey and later i 
had a new wave band called louise and the creeps i modeled at the 
same time i had this great desire to do comedy i believe in the 
power of the mind if you project something strongly enough and 
work hard enough youll get it 
i moved to los angeles and fell into improv comedy i 
performed at dinner theaters and in los angeles for a year i 
studied acting in new york but i think a lot of acting lessons put 
students in ridiculous situations acting is being its not 
acting its you and the situation youre cast in a part because 
you bring something to the role acting classes only give you the 
technical parts 
robey currently lives in toronto where the show is filmed for 
paramount television

a review of securities research letters over the 
past six months reveals a vague unintentional and disturbing 
similarity with some astrological forecasts 
various economic indicators are aligned to produce outlooks that 
tend to be recanted a few days later when with nary an apology 
the same or other indicators are rearranged to produce another 
result 
some forecasts are worded so broadly they might fit any 
occasion in many there is little consistency from one week to the 
next with inflation replacing recession economic strength 
alternating with weakness surge replacing plunge 
in a few months time the mood has switched so often that it is 
difficult to find the common themes other than fear threat 
danger and the like 
extreme often foreboding views seem to have become acceptable 
one brokers letter notes a tendency to extrapolate the most recent 
economic statistics into breathless forecasts for the next few 
years 
richard hoey chief economist of drexel burnham lambert 
observes that there have been rather hysterical swings in market 
sentiment about the economy despite only gradual shifts in 
underlying fundamentals 
as he suggests the economic fundamentals have changed little 
since octobers market crash but the views of those fundamentals 
have changed almost daily and they are likely to continue changing 
since the fall of 1987 hoey and his associates have identified 
six major themes successive ones and all overblown and lacking 
perspective and within those themes have been many times that 
number of lesser gyrations 
following the oct 19 crash the popular theme was a forecast of 
deflationary depression or a revisitation of the disaster that 
occurred beginning in 1929 
suspicions became aroused less than two months later where was 
the economic weakness the deflation that became the new theme 
but nobody knew what to make of it analysts stewed about it for a 
few weeks then came up with the meaning 
the new forecast became one of inflationary recession no 
prices wouldnt fall they would rise no there would be no 
depression but to erase the negative altogether would be too 
much there would be recession 
that thesis lasted a few weeks but in january a brief surge in 
the weekly unemployment claims gave rebirth to the thesis of 
disinflationary recession with variations that view held until 
spring and new statistics 
the new statistics were fearsome they showed economic strength 
this could not be good news any more than were earlier reports in 
the peculiar mindset of fear strength could only be bad 
therefore the theme of inflationary boom 
already that view is tiresome to some while loyal pessimists 
are still dredging up evidence to support their latest fear 
others are wondering if as in the past this thesis too has been 
overdone 
is it likely they are asking that the economy is shifting into 
a selfcorrecting mode is it possible there arent any great 
surprises out there and that economic forces will remain in 
equilibrium for a while 
certainly 
but with a record like theirs of the past six months you cant 
expect the seers to believe in equilibrium for more than a few 
weeks not when a new set of economic statistics can be juggled 
into brand new themes mostly negative

japans seemingly insatiable demand for platinum has been 
largely responsible for a 25 percent increase in the metals price 
since the year began and analysts say the rally is likely to 
continue 
fear of rising inflation has prompted many us investors to 
return to the precious metals markets which they pretty much 
abandoned after the october stock market collapse observers note 
and the possibility of supply disruptions from south africa the 
worlds leading platinum producer is never far from the minds of 
traders at the new york mercantile exchange where platinum for 
nearmonth delivery has risen from about 500 a troy ounce in early 
january to 625 this past week 
even without a breakdown in the south african pipeline our 
expectations are that primary supplies of platinum will for a 
fourth successive year fall short of net demand the londonbased 
preciousmetals refiner johnson matthey plc said in its recently 
published annual platinum review 
the british firm noted a 70 percent leap in japanese imports of 
platinum last year to 17 million ounces or 50 percent of total 
demand 
the surge in japanese demand corresponded with the dollars 
dramatic decline against the yen which sent dollardenominated 
platinum to near 10yearlows in yen terms in a country that 
prizes platinum more than gold 
traditionally the japanese have looked at platinum the way 
the rest of the world looks at gold said richard levine vice 
president of elders futures incs precious metals and foreign 
exchange group 
wedding rings in japan are made of platinum not gold he 
said for one reason or another platinum always was a desired 
metal in japan 
johnson matthey noted a huge increase in japanese purchases of 
platinum in the last two months of 1987 as us investors spooked 
by the stockmarket crash moved their money out of precious metals 
and into lessrisky investments such as government securities 
japanese buying continued apace as the selloff of precious 
metals in the united states sent platinum prices plunging below 
460 an ounce in february when platinum futures actually traded at 
a discount to gold analysts said 
new japanese tax laws making precious metals more appealing than 
savings accounts to investors also encouraged japanese buying of 
platinum experts agree 
back in the united states the calamity that many economists had 
predicted last fall failed to materialize instead the economy 
appears to be picking up steam which combined with sharp 
increases in agricultural commodity prices has been interpreted as 
a harbinger of rising inflation 
the inflation fears have renewed interest in precious metals 
among us investors who traditionally see gold silver and 
platinum as safe havens against rising prices 
i think investors got tired of earning 7 percent or 8 percent 
on their riskless investments particularly when they think 
inflation is picking up and theyre taking on a little bit of a 
more speculative bent said jacques luben executive director of 
investments for the new yorkbased platinum guild international 
analysts said the return of us investors to the precious 
metals has supported the entire complex but platinum has responded 
most sharply because of the already strong demand from the far east 
in addition the economys unexpectedly strong showing suggests 
growth in industrial demand for platinum which is used in 
automobile pollutioncontrol devices 
the possibility that south africa may halt platinum shipments to 
the united states if congress approves tougher trade sanctions also 
has underpinned platinums gains but most analysts say the threat 
is very remote 
the platinum market much thinner than the gold market is 
inherently volatile and some analysts warn that platinums gains 
may be overdone 
the very fact that the market has even focused on south africa 
indicates the market is taking the most bullish stance it could 
possibly take said george anagnos metals analyst for thomson 
mckinnon securities inc in new york 
some price increase is justified he said but unless this 
bullish interpretation pans out in every respect were going to be 
very vulnerable

any shred of innocence wall street may have 
retained was lost in last octobers crash leaving stock exchanges 
of the future to grapple with challenges their leaders could barely 
imagine a few years ago 
robert j birnbaum who left the new york stock exchange this 
past week after serving as its president and chief operating 
officer since 1985 warns that anything that happened once can 
happen again 
birnbaum 60 is an amiable selfeffacing lawyer and elder 
statesman among stock exchange managers he came to the nyse after 
18 years at the smaller american stock exchange including eight as 
its president giving him an excellent vantage point on the stock 
markets recent rocky past and daunting future 
he will become special counsel in the new york office of dechert 
price amp rhoads a large law firm 
as the inside manager in charge of daytoday operations at 
the nyse birnbaum lacked the high public profile of john j phelan 
jr the exchanges chairman in the panicky days of the october 
collapse while phelan presided over packed news conferences in an 
effort to calm the jittery investing public birnbaum quietly 
worked behind the scenes to restore order to a market that had 
veered out of control 
in an interview last thursday his final day at the exchange 
birnbaum took an inventory of what he had seen and the challenges 
that lie ahead for the securities industry 
one of the stock exchanges most imposing tasks is 
technological to help cope with another potential cataclysm the 
nyse has to gear up to handle billions of daily trades birnbaum 
said the exchange was strained to the breaking point on oct 19 by 
the plunge in stock prices and an unprecedented volume of trading 
about 600 million shares 
birnbaums successor 41yearold richard a grasso is known 
for his expertise with the exchanges computers and communications 
systems he is responsible for upgrades of the systems that 
recently gave the big board the capacity to manage volume of 600 
million shares a day as efficiently as it once handled 200 million 
but birnbaum doesnt believe the technological revolution will 
eventually create a trading floor populated only by machines 
without the pushandpull of human interaction 
you dont allow technology alone to decide the type of 
marketplace that is best for the united states he insisted 
you need the interface on the floor 
another huge change that birnbaum underscored is the growing 
involvement of government with the stock exchanges especially 
after the crash and the recent insider trading scandals the reagan 
administration appointed a special panel to study the october 
debacle and make recommendations while congress the securities 
and exchange commission and others have also gotten involved 
its lightyears different from what it used to be theres a 
much more intensive involvement with the government birnbaum 
said you have to touch the bases the government turns slowly 
you have to deal with it delicately and slowly 
birnbaum understands the government perspective on regulation of 
the financial markets he worked as an attorney at the sec in 
washington from 1961 to 1966 before going to the american stock 
exchange 
as nyse president birnbaum tried to convince brokerage firms 
that they must regulate themselves or washington would step in and 
do it for them he was instrumental in fashioning a package of new 
rules for exchange members early last year in response to the 
insider trading scandals 
birnbaum is a staunch defender on the other hand of the nyses 
specialist system which has come under criticism for not 
doing more to smoothe out the market during the crash specialists 
are appointed by exchanges to make markets in individual stocks 
they are charged with ensuring the market is orderly even if that 
means buying and selling equities from their own accounts 
reports this past week first published by the new york times 
indicated the specialists enjoyed their most profitable year ever 
in 1987 despite the crash and yet failed to bolster their capital 
reserves to protect themselves against another disaster 
the specialist system was outstanding during the crash 
birnbaum maintained i havent seen in my own time in the 
business a system that works better

the municipal bond market has held up well in 
recent weeks despite the sharp rise in interest rates becoming one 
of the brighter spots in the credit markets 
and the buzzword around the marketplace is premium 
traders and analysts say several factors have helped support 
municipal bond prices while keeping yields down among them 
continued disenchantment with the stock market concerns about 
future tax increases and a decline in supply 
the municipal market is on a roll and it is not likely to end 
soon according to a recent report by investment bankers john 
nuveen amp co inc in each of the last three months demand has 
exceeded supply and the june outlook is for more of the same 
municipal bonds took a beating last spring due to a resurgence 
in interest rates caused by a deteriorating dollar in foreign 
exchange interestrate jitters resurfaced this year causing state 
and local governments to shy away from issuing more bonds noted 
neal attermann manager of municipal bond research at kidder 
peabody amp co 
for the first five months of this year the volume of issues 
from state and local governments totaled about 398 billion down 
15 percent from about 466 billion the same period a year ago 
according to securities data cobond buyer which tracks the 
municipal market 
the data showed the decline largely could be blamed on a drop in 
refunding issues bonds sold for the sole purpose of retiring 
earlier debt carrying a higher interest rate since rates have 
risen many municipalities saw no point in going to market 
the volume of refunding issues plunged 53 percent to about 
136 billion during the januarymay period from around 292 
billion last year securities data said 
traders though are reporting a slight increase in activity 
recently several new issues this past week alone have come to 
market including 200 million in general obligation bonds from new 
york city and a 184 million issue from georgia a few others 
including a 1 billion refunding issue from louisiana are in the 
wings traders say 
still some analysts predict rising interest rates due to the 
economys apparent growth may continue to keep municipal issuers 
out of the market and at the same time they say demand isnt 
expected to let up 
since midmarch demand for municipals has increased steadily 
first on a seasonal basis due to the approach of april 15 and 
subsequently because of a growing realization that taxes are 
likely to be headed upward without the creation of any new 
shelters the nuveen noted 
people want to get that tax exemption now added james f 
lynch editor of the monthly investor newsletter lynch municipal 
bond advisory 
attermann noted that the rising demand and declining supply of 
munis have made them more attractive than some treasury bonds with 
comparable maturities 
for those who are worried that interest rates will go through 
the roof causing their bonds to erode in value a number of 
analysts are recommending investments in premium bonds these 
bonds sell for above par or 1000 but deliver a higher total 
return to investors than bonds of similar term purchased at face 
value 
the high coupon rate of this investment prevents a fast 
erosion of principal in a declining market lynch said 
lynch especially recommends premium municipal bonds that have 
been prerefunded by issuers meaning borrowers already have 
put other securities such as treasury obligations in trust to 
redeem the bonds investors therefore dont run the risk of 
having those bonds called or refunded before they mature he 
said

fears of an inflationary boom have loosened 
their grip a little on wall streets financial markets in recent 
days 
true the economy has remained much stronger by all the 
evidence than most people expected just a few months ago 
true the federal reserve has taken some precautionary steps 
lately to tighten credit signaling its intentions not to let the 
heat get turned up too high 
true as well prices of commodities ranging from soybeans to 
metals have been moving up 
nevertheless stock and bond traders have apparently decided 
they had spooked themselves unduly with visions of a new 
inflationary specter that would force policymakers to put the 
economy under severe restraints 
as jack lavery research director at merrill lynch put it the 
markets recent bout of inflationary fears reflected valid but 
exaggerated concerns 
inflation is creeping up lavery said but the rise in 
inflation is likely to be just cyclical rather than secular 
longterm 
the trend of secular disinflation gradual declines in the 
peak rates of inflation still appears to be in place 
edward yardeni economist at prudentialbache securities said 
it was noteworthy that the commerce department in issuing an 
upwardrevised figure for economic growth for the first quarter 
lowered its gauge of inflation for the januarymarch period from an 
annual rate of 24 percent to 17 percent 
yardeni acknowledged that recent price jumps in raw industrial 
commodities have been worrisome however he added were 
inclined to think that fears of an inflationary boom are 
exaggerated 
the fed has done its part to improve the mood on wall street by 
making no change in the discount rate at a time when many analysts 
were talking of an imminent increase from the current 6 percent 
in my view raising the discount rate at this juncture would 
amount to a high degree of overkill said stanley berge an 
analyst at tucker anthony amp rl day inc the fed has already 
taken steps to slow inflation 
bolstered in no small measure by an ebbing of inflation fears 
stock and bond prices rallied briskly in the past week the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 11486 to 207130 
for its largest weekly point gain ever 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 665 to 15031 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 1020 to 
37686 and the american stock exchange market value index 1038 to 
30088 
volume on the big board averaged 21633 million shares a day up 
from 13575 million the week before 
richard hoey economist at drexel burnham lambert inc said the 
markets have been suffering from hysterical swings in market 
sentiment about the economy despite only gradual shifts in 
underlying fundamentals 
this has created a themeofthemonth club on wall street 
he added with an inflationary boom as the latest theme 
while the club may soon begin to tire of the boom case he 
said inflation fears may not be totally unjustified 
the inflation risk in the us economy is not the result of a 
boom but rather of the reality that 5 years of expansion have 
sharply reduced the excess capacity in the goods and labor markets 
a modest acceleration in inflation in 1988 in a moderate wage 
environment should be followed by a stronger inflationary 
acceleration in 1989 because of a cumulative capacity tightening 
whether or not a boom pace of growth occurs 
fears of powerful inflationary acceleration in hoeys view 
are merely premature not incorrect
