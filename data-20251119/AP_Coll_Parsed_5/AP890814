a us supreme court justice monday 
temporarily halted creation of a new governing board to oversee 
desegregation of louisianas 17 public colleges and universities 
the ruling by justice byron r white who acted on emergency 
requests from state attorney general william guste and the southern 
university board of supervisors came as a state senate committee 
began confirmation hearings on 17 nominees for the governing board 
john kennedy an attorney for gov buddy roemer who opposes the 
delay agreed with guste that the case raises major constitutional 
questions on desegregation of colleges and universities 
but in a brief filed with the high court kennedy said attempts 
to postpone creation of the new board are politically motivated and 
would hinder racial intergration keeping the southern board is 
merely another form of separatism which cannot be constitutionally 
condoned the brief said 
a threejudge federal panel in new orleans ordered the 
abolishment of the states four governing boards for higher 
education as part of a plan to desegregate louisianas higher 
education system under the panels ruling the board is scheduled 
to begin operations friday 
whites order stops the elimination of the southern board until 
the full supreme court receives a response by justice department 
lawyers the order did not impose a deadline for the response guste 
and the southern board want the desegregation plan stopped until the 
full supreme court can hear an appeal 
the case began in 1974 when the justice department sued on behalf 
of black students prompting the threejudge court to rule that 
the present scheme has perpetuated illegal segregation in 
louisianas higher education 
last year the court ruled that a 1981 consent decree had failed 
to desegregate colleges and universities the agreement had called 
for the state to spend millions of dollars to upgrade southern and 
grambling state university the states predominantly black 
universities 
guste and the southern board contend that the state is not 
responsible for any vestiges of segregation that remain in 
louisianas higher education system and the fourboard system set 
up by the state constitution should not be scuttled 
we have had over 20 years without any legally imposed 
segregation a whole generation of students has grown up they are 
exercising their constitutional right of freedom of choice of 
academic programs and constitutional right of freedom of 
association guste said during a news conference 
guste said the proposed single board has been given a strict 
timetable to implement a desegregation plan including creation of a 
community college system and specified roles and missions for each 
university most of the changes are required to be implemented 
within 120 days 
a full appeal to the supreme court would take about a year guste 
said 
can you imagine what would happen a year from now if the court 
went back to the four boards it would be total confusion he said

dozens of dade county pit bull owners wore black 
armbands to protest a new licensing ordinance for their dogs but 
grudgingly complied with a requirement they register and insure the 
pets 
the measure which goes into effect today requires owners to 
keep their dogs securely fenced with a dangerous dog sign and 
to have insurance in case their dogs attack someone 
a young girl was badly mauled in the worst of several attacks 
that led the metrodade commission to pass the ordinance earlier 
this year 
some of the owners who registered their dogs and paid 50 fees 
at the dade county animal control center sunday predicted the 
commission would suffer a political backlash from angry dog owners 
this commission has woken up a sleeping giant said bob 
sanchez president of the 400member responsible dog owners of dade 
county

behind the lives destroyed in 20 years of violence 
in northern ireland lies another casualty the corruption of civil 
liberties in britain itself 
in its attempts to crush the irish republican army a nation 
that ranks among the worlds older democracies has adopted laws 
which opponents say would look more at home in a dictatorship 
prime minister margaret thatcher defends the practice of 
detaining suspects for a week without charging them or banning 
british radio and television stations from broadcasting interviews 
with ira members as part of the price for fighting terrorism 
to beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of 
your civil liberties for a time she said after last octobers 
imposition of the broadcast ban which also covers members and 
sympathizers of 10 other militant groups 
none of us can be neutral as between the terrorist and the 
lawabiding citizen added mrs thatcher who survived an ira 
hotel bombing in 1984 that killed five people including two senior 
conservative party figures 
her critics however detect a gradual warping of democratic 
freedoms since the troubles flared and britain dispatched 
troops on aug 14 1969 to keep northern irelands protestants and 
catholics apart twenty years later the troops remain 
the financial times of london in an editorial in december 
commented on a lengthening list of recent government decisions 
each of which has given greater weight to reasons of state than to 
the civic rights of the individual most but not all arise from 
the troubles in northern ireland 
however the most controversial legislation the prevention of 
terrorism act is a legacy of a labor government enacted in 1978 
after 21 civilians were killed by an ira bomb in an english pub 
the act which applies throughout what is known formally as the 
united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland includes 
police powers to detain suspects for up to a week without charge 
in the decade of rule by mrs thatchers conservative 
government northern irelands death toll climbed past 2700 and 
britain has been cited 21 times the most by any country for 
violating the european convention on human rights 
her government imposed the broadcast ban on paramilitary groups 
and limited or proposed limiting the right of a suspect to remain 
silent 
since last fall courts in northern ireland have been able to 
interpret an accuseds silence after arrest as an indication in 
some circumstances of guilt those circumstances are 
failing to mention during interrogation any fact offered in 
defense at trial 
refusing to be sworn or answer questions at trial 
failing to explain any possessions or marks on the defendants 
clothing or person at the time of arrest 
failing to give an account for being at a particular place at 
the time of arrest 
the courts themselves which are convened without juries which 
might be intimidated or split along sectarian lines are also an 
extraordinary step taken in 1973 to combat terrorism 
last month a government advisory panel proposed limiting the 
right of silence for ordinary criminals in england and wales 
regulations under the antiterrorist act have been used to 
compel photographers and television stations to hand over material 
to help police investigations 
tv networks complained their crews were put in added danger 
after being compelled last year to hand over unscreened footage of 
an ira funeral march in which two british soldiers were murdered by 
a mob 
wed been pushed another step down a road with an uncertain 
ending commented roger bolton an executive with londons thames 
television station after giving police tape of an interview with a 
suspected terrorist 
britains runins with the european court of human rights are 
partly due to the fact that this country has no written bill of 
rights or constitution and thus issues are automatically 
transferred to the court in strasbourg france instead of being 
filtered through domestic courts 
last november britain refused to implement a ruling by the 
19judge court that the antiterrorism acts detention powers 
violate the european human rights convention and should be repealed 
the case was brought by four northern ireland men who were held 
for between 4 days and a week in 1984 and then released 
britain invoked an article of the convention that says the 
ruling need not be accepted in time of war or public emergency 
threatening the life of the nation

the panama canal celebrates its 75th 
birthday tuesday still a subject of controversy a symbol of 
destiny to the united states and a reminder to panama of its 
colonial days 
the first trip through the manmade shortcut between the 
atlantic and the pacific was made by the steamer ancon on august 
15 1914 a voyage nearly lost in the rush of history as world war 
i began in europe 
we made panama the gateway to the world said arnold small 
99 who came from barbados in 1911 to work on the canal and is one 
of the few surviving workers 
the waterway made panama an international trading center but it 
also tied panama to the united states which guaranteed the young 
countrys independence from colombia in 1903 in return for a chunk 
of territory to build the canal 
ten years of work followed as a labor force that reached 36000 
built dams and locks conquered yellow fever and malaria and sawed 
through gold hill now the peak of culebra cut also known as the 
gailliard cut for its chief engineer 
the haybunau varilla treaty of 1903 created a little america in 
the 10mile wide canal zone with its own courts police stamps 
stores and lifestyle 
it was also a land of high salaries for americans and low wages 
for panamanians a land where the racial segregation of the 
american south was imposed 
that history is still being used by gen manuel antonio noriega 
and the panamanian government to whip up antius sentiment 
in 1977 president jimmy carter and the late panamanian dictator 
omar torrijos signed the treaties that eliminated the canal zone 
and called for the united states to give up all rights to the canal 
it built and maintained at noon on dec 31 1999 
noriega claims the united states plans to renege on its 
commitment to turn the canal over to panama and close down its 
military bases as commander of the defense forces noriega is de 
facto ruler of panama although he has been indicted in the united 
states on drug charges 
the canal has been good and bad for us said panamanian 
historian carlos bolivar pedreschi in an interview it helped us 
attain independence and created an efficient class of 
administrators but then the united states also created and 
supported a panamanian military class that claiming it must 
prepare to protect the canal has suppressed the democratic 
forces 
after 75 years the canal is working as well as ever in 1988 
more than 12300 ships about 211 million tons passed through 
paying out more than 340 million in tolls 
and traffic is increasing in both number and volume as more and 
more ships are built to the maximum the canal can take the locks 
are 1000 feet long 110 feet wide 
ships are lifted 85 feet from one ocean and deposited again in 
the other through the locks whose level rises or descends 
depending on the ships direction 
in between the ships sail through nine narrow miles at culebra 
cut and cross gatun lake 138 square miles of fresh water formed by 
a dam across the chagres river 
while the importance of the canal to the united states has been 
reduced by air and highways over the land bridge between east 
and west coasts and by the increased size of the us navy 14 
percent of us maritime trade still moves through the locks 
the canal is increasingly being used by japanese korean and 
other far eastern nations to export to the united states europe 
and latin america asiaeast coast trade accounts for 45 percent of 
canal traffic by itself 
and while the volume is lower the canal is vital to economic 
development in latin american nations the canal route from peru to 
the east coast is 6200 miles shorter than sailing around cape horn 
at the tip of south america 
far into the 21st century the canal will continue to be an 
important route for many countries said deputy administrator 
fernando manfredo the highestranking panamanian on the panama 
canal commission 
in the past two years the united states used its control to put 
pressure on the panamanian government to oust noriega the 
shortterm outlook is for more confrontation 
us forces charged with defense of the canal often carry out 
maneuvers on panamanian soil as a show of force the shortterm 
outlook is for more confrontation 
the us government which operates the waterway through the 
panama canal commission has withheld more than 100 million in 
canal tolls from the government of panama 
the canal commissions adminstrator is a us citizen and the 
deputy adminstrator a panamanian roles that are to reverse jan 1 
according to the cartertorrijos treaties 
but the united states is not likely to approve a panamanian 
linked to noriega and noriega is unlikely to nominate manfredo who 
might gain approval 
you will have a deputy us administrator running the canal 
manfredo said 
nevertheless the canal will remain for a long time panamas 
main natural resource according to pedreschi 
us agencies involved in the operation of the canal paid more 
than 224 million in wages and salaries to employees in 1988 in 
addition more than 200 milion went into the panamanian economy as 
payment for services for direct purchases and for construction 
manfredo said that for the next 20 years canal traffic should 
register a sustained growth of 2 percent annually if the canal 
is run efficiently and there are no exaggerated canal toll 
increases and if there are no political problems 
manfredo says the panamanians have the capacity to run and 
improve the canal pointing to ongoing work to control mudslides at 
gold hill 
the canal still arouses intense emotion among some in the united 
states who believe that it should never be given up but most us 
canal workers are reconciled to the fact 
the work force of about 7500 is 85 percent panamanian one 
vital engineering area the locks division is 100 percent 
panamanian slowest to change have been the pilots where 58 of 238 
are panamanian

when solidarity agreed last spring to take 
only 35 percent of parliament seats union strategists saw it as 
the first step in a smooth fouryear transition from a oneparty 
state to full democracy 
but they did not reckon with the explosion in public 
expectations that followed solidaritys election victory in june 
or the sudden deterioration in the economy 
poles dont want to wait for change and thats the reason 
solidarity leader lech walesa gave when he made an aboutface last 
week and urged formation of a solidarityled coalition government 
according to senator jaroslaw kaczynski acting as walesas 
personal envoy in the coalition talks walesa himself might become 
prime minister 
it is a far cry from the plan articulated by solidarity 
strategists after last springs agreement that set the stage for 
the oppositions entrance into parliamentary politics 
as originally conceived solidarity would use this parliamentary 
term to monitor communist authorities from the opposition bench 
while getting familiar with the nuts and bolts of government and 
creating independent political parties to win elections in 1993 
in the meantime the communist party and polands east bloc 
allies especially the soviet union would have time to 
accommodate themselves to the notion of a noncommunist poland 
two months after the elections that timetable already is 
looking outdated 
desperately counting on changes for the better poles standing 
in line for such basics as bread and meat are in no mood to talk 
about waiting until 1993 for a change in government 
industrial production is falling food prices went up sharply 
aug 1 store shelves are often empty and there are signs poland is 
slipping into hyperinflation 
when the communist party named three familiar faces to the 
countrys three top jobs gen wojciech jaruzelski as president 
mieczyslaw f rakowski as party chief and gen czeslaw kiszczak as 
prime minister the publics patience seemed to snap 
walesas quest for the government is a reaction to the resulting 
social impatience said senator aleksander paszynski 
we asked ourselves can we wait the answer is no said 
solidaritys parliamentary leader bronislaw geremek 
as early as june 2 jaruzelski had proposed a grand 
coalition government whose distribution of ministries would 
reflect more or less the proportion of voting strength in 
parliament that is twothirds of the cabinet for the communist 
coalition and onethird for solidarity 
then walesa replied in essence no thanks well stay in 
opposition 
he did not want solidaritys name tarnished in the kind of phony 
coalition rule that took place in poland after world war ii then 
figurehead ministers of various political stripes served to 
camouflage the communist consolidation of power beneath the surface 
as a counterproposal just before kiszczaks election walesa 
offered to take on the whole government including the defense and 
police ministries 
jaruzelski as walesa could have expected rejected that 
according to opposition lawmakers jaruzelski made clear that the 
soviet union would not support a solidarity government 
but after kiszczaks election as prime minister aug 2 as the 
protests rose from grassroots solidarity chapters walesa went on 
the offensive 
he called for a noncommunist coalition government that would 
include solidarity and the previously communistallied minor 
parties the peasants and the democrats 
geremek broadened the offer proposing places in the government 
to reformist communists 
walesas move has touched off a flurry of meetings and 
consultations with the peasants and democrats expressing interest 
there have been rumblings of worry from moscow 
the soviet ambassador even went to talk to the leaders of the 
two minor parties 
where it will end is anyones guess all that can be said is 
that the options for the next government have been significantly 
widened 
by merely putting up a fight for the government walesa has 
scored at least three political successes 
he has put the communists on the defensive forcing them to 
justify to public opinion why they should lead the government 
he has widened the rifts within the communist coalition 
provoking the normally reliable democrats and peasants to show 
unprecedented independence 
and he has protected solidarity from charges that it was 
unwilling to take responsibility for leading the country 
now the stage is set for hard political bargaining 
jaruzelskis original idea of a grand coalition government 
that would include some combination of communists and solidarity 
ministers may still become a reality but under terms negotiated to 
walesas satisfaction

ask anyone in shirley harrisons coalmining 
family what the united mine workers strike is about and the 
answer will have nothing to do with money 
they all believe that pittston coal group has drafted a contract 
designed to break the union 
and were going to fight like hell to see that they dont 
mrs harrison said 
at a recent umw rally at the russell county courthouse in this 
town in far western virginia mrs harrison and her two daughters 
were singing union songs while her husband a disabled miner stood 
by one brother was arrested for participating in a sitdown 
demonstration on the front steps and another brother a strike 
captain was videotaping the entire scene 
the perception that pittston is out to bust the union which the 
company disputes is the main reason behind a bargaining deadlock 
neither side expected an end to the stalemate as negotiators 
prepared for their 139th bargaining session tuesday talks began in 
november 1987 the strike is in its fifth month 
the issue of survival for pittstons 1695 union employees 
caused wildcat sympathy strikes by about 46000 umw members at 
other coal companies in 10 states last month the wildcat strikers 
returned to work the week of july 17 
its something we fight for from the heart because its in the 
heart coal mining is our way of life here said mrs harrison 
50 whose father grandfather and greatgrandfather mined the rich 
coal veins of southwestern virginia 
in a normal summer mrs harrison said she would be organizing 
family picnics and barbecues at their castlewood home now the 
relatives gather at rallies demonstrations and court hearings 
were closer than weve ever been she said pittston is 
actually making families and the union stronger 
the issues have not fundamentally changed since pittston broke 
away from the group of coal companies that negotiated a national 
contract with the umw last year 
union officials have portrayed pittstons proposals as an 
assault on the families whose forefathers were digging coal for the 
company and its predecessors even before the umw began organizing 
the coalfields in the 1920s 
pittston president michael odom said the main issue for the 
company which exports 65 percent of its coal is operational 
flexibility the company needs to cut labor costs if it hopes to 
continue competing in the global market he said 
the company wants to operate its mines on a 7dayaweek 
24houraday schedule ease work rules cut health care and 
pension costs and contract out more labor 
odom said the company is offering higher wages and an 
independent pension plan that is better than the industrywide plan 
umw spokesman joe corcoran said that since 1984 pittston has 
been transferring coal reserves to new nonunion coal mining 
subsidiaries while laying off union employees corcoran contended 
that pittston is trying to gradually become a nonunion operation 
odom denies that pointing to a company promise to try to 
maintain employment at the prestrike level of 1695 
the company however is offering a contract without a 
successorship clause such a clause requires that if any of 
pittstons 12 union coal companies is sold the new owner must 
honor the union contract and keep the union workforce

a coven of witches in rhode island the 
state founded as a haven for religious dissenters hope they too 
will gain public acceptance now that the state has declared them a 
legitimate religious group 
members of the rosegate coven want outsiders to see them as 
followers of a faith not freaks who ride brooms and cast spells 
in a recent interview in a kitchen adorned with skulls pictures 
of sorcerers the obligatory broom and a humorous kitchenwitch 
coven members talked about their attempts to sensitize others to 
their beliefs 
we have to combat centuries of conditioning people have been 
conditioned by their religion and society to ridicule us not 
to take anything seriously that the christian religion doesnt put 
forth said the covens high priestess joyce siegrist also 
known as lady genevieve 
people dont easily give up their misconceptions they really 
enjoy them said siegrist 46 also the director of the new 
england chapter of the witches antidefamation league 
at a meeting last october the group which has about 40 
members decided to incorporate as a nonprofit religious group and 
apply for an exemption from rhode island sales tax last week the 
state tax administrator overruled an earlier decision and approved 
the request 
the certificate granting the exemption is framed and hangs in 
the modest kitchen near an enlarged photograph showing the 
rosegate grove or overall group of about 40 initiates the 
coven or inner core of leaders consists of about a dozen people 
obviously the intent wasnt to save the 6 percent sales tax 
said julian bradford who handles rosegates public relations it 
was to obtain the legitimization 
the coven also known as our lady of the roses wiccan church 
decided to come out of the closet in part because of the recent 
publicity about satanists 
weve been lumped with them for 800 years it makes us stand 
up and say enough is enough said bradford 
it doesnt make sense to the witches that people confuse them 
with satanists to believe in satan you have to believe in the 
judeochristian tradition bradford said 
the wiccans believe in a diety with male and female attributes 
whose psychic energy can be tapped by anyone rosegate a wiccan 
sect emphasizes metaphsyics rather than simple magic and does not 
use many of the props often associated with witchcraft 
in our tradition we are trying to erradicate needless 
superstition said siegrist citing as an example the use of 
crystal balls the ball doesnt have diddly the power comes from 
within 
from siegrists kitchen office equipped with a copying machine 
the coven puts out a newsletter eight times a year keeps track of 
its 75subscriber mailing list arranges witchcraft classes and 
plans meetings 
the group has a small building fund and hopes someday to open a 
center complete with sanctuary and classrooms 
rosegate suffers little harassment overall said siegrist a 
crank caller who repeatedly called during the interview was 
really the first crank ive ever had to put up with she said 
but the mockery is always going to exist said bradford 
were the victims of eight or nine centuries of bad press 
when hostility surfaces we try our best not to return it 
siegrist said 
the witches profess to be uninhibited about their beliefs but 
appear to be held back by their traditional upbringings 
sanura 49 the secretary and musician of the group said she 
has told only one family member she is a witch those irish 
catholics would disown me for sure she declined to give her 
nonwitch name 
bradford who fought in vietnam and has mother tatooed on 
his forearm said were very open about what we are because we 
have nothing to hide we welcome the opportunity to educate 
others 
he said others are accepting when they learn he is a witch 
one guy made broom jokes at work until he had a problem i 
worked out with a little magic he said bradford who works at 
an east providence car dealership would not elaborate on the 
problem or his solution other than to say there was no hocus 
pocus simply the application of proven metaphysical principles 
now that the coven has proven its legitimate at least in the 
eyes of rhode islands division of taxation what does it want now 
give us a corporate broom to fly us to the bahamas joked 
bradford

even in the dogeatdog corporate world you 
cant serve sloppy spaghetti at your dinner parties business 
students at stetson university are told 
at the university of miami aspiring moguls learn to put the 
butter plate on the left and never forget to rsvp 
while american business still runs on bareknuckle competition 
a few institutions are recognizing that students need to learn some 
manners before entering the fray 
its amy vanderbilt meets donald trump as courses in the social 
graces and communication skills begin to appear at some business 
schools 
we were totally unprepared for the response said stetson 
university professor stephen barnett who incorporated several 
etiquette lectures into his sales management class at deland 
college last semester the students had so many questions and 
took such an interest in the topic weve decided to expand 
this fall barnett is planning a weekly evening course in 
etiquette that also would address such related subjects as proper 
attire and crosscultural business relationships he plans to 
stress social skills during the annual threeweek overseas trip for 
his students at the private university near orlando 
the key to the whole thing is making the students prepared for 
all the different people and situations theyll face when they 
leave school said barnett here its comfortable and they get 
along well but they may not be equipped to say entertain 
properly or set a table some of this stuff is so basic its scary 
in a way 
margaret lee wife of stetson president h douglas lee has 
become the unofficial mentor in barnetts class by giving several 
lectures and drawing on her experience as a seasoned hostess 
for the course mrs lee offered tips on power entertaining 
and being a gracious guest 
for example she advises those holding a dinner party to 
scrupulously plan and avoid leaving the table once the meal is 
served for guests bringing a small gift or flowers is a nice 
touch even at businessrelated dinner parties 
the things that one does for a regular party shouldnt change 
because its with business colleagues said mrs lee manners 
are manners 
many collegeage students stumble socially and are perplexed by 
protocol because of the way they were raised said karen aronoff 
who began lecturing on business etiquette last year at the 
university of miami school of business administration 
these are kids whose parents for the most part were part 
of the 60s counterculture their mottos were do your own thing 
and forget tradition she said its not surprising their 
children are not familiar with the traditional social routines 
nelda crowell a spokeswoman at the american graduate school of 
international business in glendale ariz predicts more campuses 
will begin etiquette courses in anticipation of european economic 
community trade reforms in 1992 
were going to have to teach american business people how to 
work over there and not look like a fool she said 
letitia baldrige whose 1978 guide to executive manners 
still sells briskly blames the dynamics of contemporary life for 
creating frenzied workers who are uneasy in informal settings 
outside the office 
how many families get together for a meal and just to talk 
these days said ms baldrige chief of staff for the first lady 
during the kennedy administration people now are caught up in 
this fastfood fastpaced mania then go home and sit in front of 
the television no wonder people dont even know how to hold a fork 
and knife

a retirement program for chimpanzees used in 
hepatitis and aids research will house them in 63000 
airconditioned bungalows repayment for the apes service to 
humanity a researchers says 
we dont think of any of the animals as just tools of 
research said dr jorg eichberg director of veterinary 
resources at the southwest foundation for biomedical research 
theyve done so much for mankind this is one way we can pay them 
back 
a 29 million pension fund is being established at a san 
antonio bank with some of the chimps earnings the research 
grants and fees private and government research institutions pay to 
use the animals the dallas morning news reported sunday 
a separate fund will pay for 12 airconditioned retirement huts 
at a cost of 63000 each to house chimp retirees 
plans also are under way to build a playground for the chimps 
similar to the 270000 breeding colony now in use a large airy 
complex complete with swings tires and grass 
huts inhabited by the animals during research have 19inch color 
televisions but the retirees will have to do without eichberg 
said 
the retired chimps can visit with each other he said 
they dont get bored enough to watch tv 
the journal of medical primatology has touted the plan as a 
model for other research centers the newspaper reported 
the 192 chimps at the southwest foundation comprise one of the 
worlds largest captive colonies 
currently 45 are used in research for vaccines against 
hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus or hiv the virus that 
causes aids the rest are used in other private and government 
medical research or for breeding 
in 1983 eichberg became the first scientist in the world to 
infect a chimpanzee with hiv that chimp 15yearold paul is now 
in retirement at the foundation 
since the chimps cant be used for other research and since 
chimps can live to age 50 southwest foundation researchers felt 
the need to find some way to take care of them officials said they 
expect the retirement colony eventually to include 80 chimps 
the foundation spends about 1 million a year or 17 a day per 
chimp to feed and maintain its animals according to foundation

echoes of the woodstock festival reverberate in 
american society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked 
the nation but when it comes to rock n roll itself most people 
say the tunes gone flat 
eight in 10 american adults have heard of the woodstock 
festival held aug 1517 1969 on a muddy farm in upstate new 
york and three in 10 of them wish they had attended a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
that high level of awareness was rooted in a view of woodstock 
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show most regard 
it as the expression of a social movement and half of them said 
that movement continues today 
yet the view of woodstock was not an idealized one while nearly 
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a 
lasting effect on american society only half of them said the 
effect was a positive one 
even more striking was the widely held opinion that times have 
changed for the better just a quarter said the woodstock era was a 
better time than today while half viewed it a worse time than now 
but respondents were critical of the course of rock n roll 
music the raucous hallmark of the woodstock era rock music of the 
woodstock days was rated twice as highly as the rock n roll of 
today nearly half of all respondents said they still listen to 
woodstockera rock 
the poll conducted among a random sample of 1163 adults 
nationwide had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points 
as could be expected it found a dramatic generational division 
in views of woodstock for example 40 percent of those younger 
than 45 would have liked to have attended compared with just 10 
percent of the older respondents 
moreover among those who saw a lasting social impact of 
woodstock more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a 
positive effect while only about a quarter of the older group 
agreed 
interest in rock music followed similar lines more than 60 
percent of those under 45 said they listen to woodstockera rock 
n roll now evidence of the sizable audience for classic rock 
radio programming of those 45 and older just 22 percent were 
tuned in to woodstock rock 
overall 50 percent rated rock music of the late 1960s and early 
1970s as excellent or good while just 27 percent gave those 
favorable ratings to the rock n roll of today among respondents 
under 45 seven in 10 gave high ratings to woodstock rock while 
only four in 10 approved of newer rock 
the woodstock festival featuring most of the top rock bands of 
the day drew half a million people to max yasgurs farm in bethel 
ny the term woodstock nation soon came to refer to young 
people who were agitating for an end to the vietnam war and the 
loosening of social mores 
twenty percent of the polls respondents said they knew someone 
who attended woodstock and 25 of the 1163 people polled said they 
were there

the latest book about former president reagan 
begins with a quotation from him there are simple answers it 
only tells half the story and thats the trouble with the book 
the full quotation which the authors of the acting 
president provide later in their first chapter is there are 
simple answers but there are not always easy ones 
that gives a more complete picture of reagans point than the 
partial quote selected by authors bob schieffer and gary paul gates 
as an epigraph for their volume newly published by ep dutton 
reagan has already been the subject of many books and more are 
in the works 
lou cannon who covered the reagan white house for the 
washington post and wrote about the former president previously 
when he was governor of california has already written two reagan 
books his third about the reagan presidency is to be published 
late in 1990 or early in 1991 
reagan himself is at work on two books a volume of speeches 
with introductions containing his own reflections on his career is 
due out in november an autobiographical work will follow former 
first lady nancy reagan will tell her version in a book due out 
soon 
edmund morris pulitzer prize winning biographer of theodore 
roosevelt was selected by reagan to write his authorized 
biography and former attorney general edwin meese a reagan 
associate since sacramento days is writing a memoir focusing on 
the reagan era in modern political history 
schieffer chief washington correspondent for cbs news who 
covered the white house in the ford administration and his cbs 
colleague gates draw heavily on previous books and say they also 
conducted scores of interviews 
their theme is that reagan the first president to have come 
from the ranks of professional actors was essentially a figurehead 
manipulated by more knowledgeable aides 
there is some truth to this as a boy in illinois reagan did 
not set his sights on a political career his first love was 
acting the skills he honed in hollywood served him well in 
washington he was not the first politician to be a public 
performer but he was better at it than most like other 
presidents he was often dependent on staff work and aides jostled 
each other for influence over him 
it is no news that he often left details to others former white 
house chief of staff and treasury secretary donald regan for 
instance has said that in four years at treasury he never had a 
discussion of economic policy with reagan and that the president 
rarely made a decision or issued orders in a meeting while he 
was chief of staff 
however as the authors of the present book say it was reagan 
not former white house chief of staff james a baker iii or some 
other aide who observed with more than routine interest the 
troubles jimmy carter had with his foreign policy apparatus and it 
was reagan not his advisers who lost patience with alexander haig 
and accepted his resignation as secretary of state 
the books thesis also falls a bit flat when schieffer and 
gates describing how baker and other key aides put together an 
agenda for reagans first term write that they had correctly 
read the mood and the mind of the man they served 
in other words baker and others may have fleshed the ideas out 
but they were reagans ideas it was the reagan administration if 
baker had been president or if former secretary of state george 
shultz or somebody else had been president it would have been a 
different administration 
however much or little reagan knew of the details of the 
irancontra affair the driving force behind it was his 
preoccupation with the fate of american hostages and his zeal to 
aid the nicaraguan rebels as the writers correctly report shultz 
and former secretary of defense caspar weinberger tried to talk him 
out of it 
it might be possible to get through eight years as president by 
just reading your lines but the acting president fails to 
prove that it happened

the average price of gasoline fell nearly 
three cents a gallon at the pump in the past three weeks a 
nationwide survey found 
the national average was 11295 cents a gallon on friday 271 
cents below the average on july 21 according to the lundberg 
survey the average includes all grades self and fullservice 
and all taxes 
a drop of this magnitude during such a short period is 
something that motorists have not seen since 1986 analyst trilby 
lundberg said sunday 
the survey of 13000 gasoline stations found that prices per 
gallon at selfserve pumps were regular unleaded 10229 cents 
premium unleaded 11832 cents and regular leaded 10264 cents 
prices per gallon at fullservice pumps were regular unleaded 
12955 cents premium unleaded 14174 cents and regular leaded 
12925 cents 
ms lundberg said refiners and importers overcompensated to 
forestall any shortage because of tight refining capacity and new 
vapor regulations on gasoline 
as a result she said there is an abundance of supply and a 
cleaner product

in its heyday in beirut the cia counted among 
its assets an exotic array of lebanese politicians and generals 
dozens of agents from other moslem countries and a handful of 
highly placed palestinian guerrillas 
the cia was even able to use the palestinians to foil 
kidnappings and killing of americans 
but over the past 10 years us intelligence capabilities in 
lebanon have eroded to the extent that the central intelligence 
agency cannot pinpoint the location of the eight american hostages 
that remain after the reported killing of marine lt col william 
higgins 
the dearth of intelligence about the hostages and their 
iranianallied captors is partly the legacy of a string of 
disasters that has hounded cia operations in lebanon and also the 
result of the clannish nature and zealousness of the shiite moslem 
kidnappers officials and experts say 
we dont have adequate information on where they live 
operate train said robert mcfarlane the former national 
security adviser who helped plan the white house scheme to free the 
hostages by selling weapons to iran in 198586 
under ideal conditions he said in an interview the cia would 
recruit native lebanese or americans of lebanese origin to 
infiltrate the hostagetakers and report on their activities 
but hezbollah the umbrella group under whose auspices the 
captors operate defies penetration said sen david boren 
dokla chairman of the senate intelligence committee 
these little cells these units are like organized crime 
families boren said in an interview strangers are easily 
spotted even if theyre lebanese he added 
marius deeb a lebanese who taught political science at the 
american university of beirut for many years thinks many lebanese 
would be willing to give information to the united states about the 
kidnappers 
but theyre terrorized theyre scared they have to know for 
sure that if they give information their life will be protected 
deeb said 
such protection is impossible to guarantee in the chaos of a 
country splintered by 14 years of civil war and foreign occupation 
and the history of cia operations in lebanon has not been 
reassuring 
soon after the agencys beirut station chief william buckley 
was kidnapped outside his home in 1984 some of the cias lebanese 
agents were murdered or disappeared according to david martin and 
john walcott coauthors of best laid plans the book traces the 
administrations attempts to fight terrorism in the middle east 
us officials believe buckley revealed many secrets under 
torture possibly in iran before being killed his body has not 
been recovered 
on april 18 1983 a car bomb explosion demolished much of us 
embassy in beirut just as the cias chief middle east analyst 
robert ames convened a staff meeting in his office 
ames was one of 16 americans killed along with station chief 
kenneth haas martins and walcott say the blast wiped out all but 
two of the agencys staff in beirut 
david ignatius a washington post editor who has written a 
fictionalized account of the secret us channel to the plo cites 
israels 1982 invasion of lebanon and the forced exile of yasser 
arafat from beirut as the turning point of the cias fortunes 
as lebanon became more anarchic and new groups emerged with 
which we had no contact the old board was broken and we never 
really learned to play on the new one ignatius said 
the cia was dealt another blow last december when matthew k 
gannon an agency official who had been on temporary duty in 
beirut was killed on his way back in the explosion of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland believed to have been caused by a 
terrorists bomb 
mcfarlane and others familiar with intelligence operations 
suggest the cias ability to operate in lebanon was hampered by a 
decision 12 years ago by former agency chief stansfield turner to 
concentrate more on technical intelligence gathering through 
satellites and electronic interceptions 
the late cia director william casey faced great resistance 
within the agency and the intelligence community when he tried to 
expand human collection of intelligence mcfarlane said 
casey then turned outside the agency to former white house 
aide oliver north in an effort to find out what had happened to 
the american hostages in lebanon and how they could be freed 
norths dealings with iran including sales of usmade missiles 
brought about the release of two hostages in 1986

the tall trees and large lawns can hardly 
camouflage the fact that the avalon garden housing project lies at 
the crackaddled nerve center of the citys gang wars 
in the playground above a mural of five of snow whites seven 
dwarfs someone has scrawled avalon garden crips marking the 
collection of small stucco apartment buildings as turf claimed by a 
deadly street gang 
los angeles is like a chameleon observed ralph sutton of 
brotherhood crusade a social service group there are places 
that seem so serene and peaceful and just the night before there 
was bloodletting 
crimeplagued blocks alternate and sometimes merge with the 
safer blocks around the housing project which lies in the heart of 
the citys violent southcentral region it is not uncommon to find 
a bulletscarred crack house next to a wellkept cottage with 
neatly trimmed bushes and a white wroughtiron fence 
as a kind of war rages for control of the streets many 
residents in the mostly workingclass black and hispanic 
nieghborhood have retreated behind barred windows and doors 
but lately a coalition of community leaders social workers 
business people church members and civil rights activists have 
launched a project called taking our community back 
coordinated by brotherhood crusade the program has recruited 
hundreds of volunteers to walk day and night through a 110block 
section of some of the citys worst streets knocking on doors 
handing out literature painting over graffiti clearing alleys and 
confronting drug dealers and gang members 
were not going to allow our community to be held hostage 
says danny bakewell president and founder of brotherhood crusade 
the goal is to take control of the region for the next 30 to 45 
days and give residents the motivation and courage to carry on 
the patrols until now scattered around the neighborhood began 
in force over the weekend hundreds of men some responding to a 
fullpage advertisement in a local newspaper have volunteered to 
walk the streets 
were trying to create a different buzzing going on in the 
streets a different kind of interaction bakewell said when 
we leave that community needs to be strong enough to sustain this 
on an ongoing basis 
police and city officials are cooperating with the organizers 
and call the effort one of the citys most innovative residents 
also are optimistic 
but los angeles county averages more than one gang killing a 
day and some people suggest the program while long on good 
intentions may be short on staying power 
police say a concerted effort is needed to make a dent in crime 
in the neighborhood where 52 assaults 89 burglaries 37 robberies 
and 32 auto thefts were reported over last six months police did 
not have murder statistics for the area 
theyre certainly on the right track but theyve got to 
ignite people in the community to carry it on said deputy chief 
bernard parks head of the departments antigang operations 
sustaining it and being able to endure are key 
bakewell acknowledged that the task appears as daunting as the 
areas alleys at night but refused to accept negative talk 
how successful this ultimately will be i dont know he 
said but what i do know is im not prepared to sit around and 
declare my community dead the future of the community null and 
void thats just no way to live 
unlike new york city where antidrug crusader maria hernandez 
was shot dead last week apparently by drug dealers authorities 
have reported no lethal reprisals against community activists and 
the program already has enjoyed some success 
on aug 5 more than 350 people attended a kickoff rally in 
green meadows park a grassy battleground between turfs controlled 
by the crips and bloods gangs 
since the rally volunteers have chased away gang members who 
used to congregate near the tattered nets of the parks two tennis 
courts 
cleanup patrols roamed gang and drugplagued wadsworth avenue 
behind the park painting over the graffiti on fences and houses 
its taking back your neighborhood thats exactly what it 
means said ferdia harris who moved to the community in 1948 
when we moved out here it was not the same the children werent 
running the streets weve got to make this work

drug policy director william j bennett says 
he doesnt think new taxes are needed to wage his expanded war on 
drugs but congress must make some difficult choices to find 
the money 
meanwhile bush budget director richard g darman said the 
administration may be forced to consider raising taxes next year 
unless congress agrees to cuts in medicare and other entitlement 
programs 
bennett on sunday defended nancy reagans just say no 
campaign and other reagan administration efforts to combat drugs 
saying that drug users themselves not failed government policies 
are to blame for the way the problem has spread through society 
asked on cbs face the nation if he would recommend raising 
taxes as part of his new antidrug strategy bennett replied 
dont think we need taxes 
but he insisted the money will be there we will put our 
cards on the table we will suggest what we want to do and we will 
propose spending more money then we will see what the congress 
wants to do 
it means making some difficult choices he said 
bennett by law must forward a new national strategy for fighting 
drugs to congress by sept 5 it is expected to call for a major 
boost in federal spending and emphasize both tougher penalties for 
individual drug use and mandatory treatment for addicts 
bennett was asked if his approach marks a reversal from the 
reagan administration policy which cut funds for treatment and 
emphasized drug interdiction and arrests of kingpins 
the 21 billion spent fighting drugs during the reagan 
administration wasnt wasted and it wasnt all wrong said 
bennett there were some real successes during the reagan era 
i dont think anyone can deny that drugs are pervasive 
throughout much of america said bennett although casual drug 
use is down 
although some people like to criticize the educational efforts 
and the first ladys efforts they obviously have had some 
effect said bennett 
its the people who are taking drugs that are causing these 
tragedies not the government he said 
darman director of the office of management and budget said he 
will recommend that bush seek fiscal 1991 cuts in the growth of 
medicare agriculture veterans and other entitlement programs but 
not social security 
darman on nbcs meet the press repeated bushs resolve not 
to raise taxes but said 
when the congress comes back in september if they dont fully 
implement the bipartisan budget agreement we will have to have a 
sequester and it will drive us toward having to face the tax issue 
the following year which we shouldnt do 
he said the administration and the legislative branch must find 
savings of 25 billion to 30 billion to avoid an automatic 
acrosstheboard cut under the grammrudmanhollings deficit 
reduction law 
he said medicare payments for doctors fees have risen at 
about 15 percent a year that cant go on forever its going to 
consume the whole budget so we have to restrain the growth there 
there are going to be some wealthy doctors presumably who 
arent quite so wealthy in the future he predicted

us officials are ready to help investigate 
the crash in ethiopia of a plane carrying rep mickey leland and 
his party if that countrys government requests aid a pentagon 
official says 
navy capt stan bloyer said on sunday the retrieval of remains 
was expected to begin today at the mountainside crash site 
we would like to extend our deepest sympathy and condolence to 
the families involved he said 
the bodies were to be flown by helicopter to the village of 
dembidola north of the crash site then ferried to the ethiopian 
capital of addis ababa by c130 cargo plane 
they were expected to arrive in the united states within two to 
three days on board a c141 medical evacuation aircraft after a 
stop at torrejon air base near madrid spain where full mortuary 
facilities are available bloyer said 
forensic and medical specialists were dispatched from addis 
ababa to aid in the retrieval work 
bloyer said us officials are ready to assist should the 
ethiopian government request help in conducting an inquiry into the 
crash 
rep gary ackerman dny who was aboard the mh60 search and 
rescue helicopter that first spotted the wreckage relayed that 
in his judgment there was no possibility of survivors bloyer 
said 
the state department also expressed condolences saying the 
crash apparently has resulted in the death of all those aboard 
the condition of the plane is extensively destroyed basically 
disintegrated bloyer said the wreckage is located on a ravine 
on a very steep mountainside and there is evidence of a postimpact 
fire 
bloyer said it was unknown whether the pilot was headed for an 
alternate destination when the plane crashed but it did not appear 
to be attempting an emergency landing 
it appeared that it just impacted at cruise speed in the 
side of the mountain he said 
bloyer said the area where the crash occurred had been searched 
earlier but bad weather had made it difficult to find the 
wreckage the improved visibility on sunday was a major factor in 
locating the crash site in the rugged mountain terrain he said 
sixteen people were believed on board but bloyer said officials 
were unsure how many ethiopian observers had joined the delegation 
making an immediate exact count impossible 
leland a texas democrat who heads the house select committee on 
hunger was bound for the fugnido refugee camp near the sudanese 
border when the twin otter plane vanished in bad weather on aug 7 
he was accompanied by eight americans including three members of 
his staff a friend of the congressman three workers for the us 
agency for international development and the wife of one of the 
aid officials 
the us government had mobilized a massive search team for the 
rescue effort involving hundreds of people and a variety of 
aircraft including u2 spy planes

house speaker tom foley knows his way around 
the power corridors of the nations capital its finding his new 
office that occasionally has him doing an aboutface 
old habits die hard said foley admitting that he 
occasionally leaves the house floor and finds himself heading down 
the stairs toward his old office 
for eight years first as democratic whip and then as majority 
leader the cozy suite on the ground floor in the original part of 
the capitol building was home to foley his staff and his aging dog 
alice 
tourists wandering the main hallway would often peek inside 
trying to catch a glimpse of someone famous when mice were 
discovered scampering about foley brought in a cat 
numbered paint chips of varying shades of yellow were taped to a 
wall for months 
now along with the challenges of being one of the preeminent 
politicians in the country foley has a new office suite just off 
the house floor 
all in all it would have been convenient and comfortable not 
to move said foley it doesnt feel like home it is still 
unfamiliar slightly awkward 
foley knows well that along with the power of his new office 
come the trappings besides his new office is convenient to the 
floor and the cloakrooms where much of the daytoday business of 
the house is conducted 
a month after moving foley and his staff are settling in 
although boxes of files are still stacked in the corners and 
painters still wander around touching up 
foleys private office looks a lot like his old one 
the texas longhorn orange walls that former speaker jim wright 
left behind are now the same vivid blue of foleys previous office 
the comfortable grouping of living room furniture is the same as 
are most of the paintings 
i dont care for the institutional beige or green common to 
most government buildings said foley i prefer either white or 
pale or very bright colors 
even though his ceremonial office where he meets the press 
daily and greets some visitors has a battleshipsized desk 
foleys private office does not 
i dont feel comfortable sitting behind a desk when talking 
with people said foley who spends most of his time in a 
comfortable easy chair on the phone or wandering in and out of his 
staffs offices 
while his former office suite was like a crowded rabbits warren 
the new one is spacious staffers complain it is not as conducive 
to the intense giveandtake sessions common in their former 
quarters 
the offices look out over the east front of the capitol with a 
view of the library of congress and the supreme court through the 
trees of a grass plaza 
the new suite dates back only to the early 1960s when the east 
front of the capitol was extended though foleys ceremonial office 
dates to the civil war era and the nearby women members lounge was 
the room where john quincy adams died 
foley said he plans no major renovations but the dining 
room will receive a facelift as the new speaker wants to have a 
more formal setting for lunches with such people as visiting 
foreign dignitaries 
as for alice foley said his pet has made the adjustment 
pretty well we havent really done that much except move furniture 
around it will take a couple of months to feel comfortable

sen claiborne pell chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee and a veteran of 28 years in congress 
isnt acting like a politician interested in six more years when 
his current term expires 
while other senators up for reelection next year have already 
raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and in some cases several 
million pells fundraising activities have been moribund 
the rhode island democrat received only a single 5000 
contribution in the first half of this year despite the threat of a 
strong republican opponent for the first time in nearly two decades 
pell aides insist he plans to run for the seat but that he has 
his own timetable and will begin fundraising when he is ready 
republicans however say claudine schneider an aggressive and 
popular fiveterm gop congresswoman has a good chance of winning 
the seat even if pell does run they say the incumbent could be 
vulnerable because of his age the historic difficulties that 
foreign relations committee chairmen have faced and his passionate 
interest in psychic phenomena 
democrats hold a 5545 advantage in the senate and pell is one 
of six democratic incumbents being targeted by national gop 
strategists for 1990 
pells lack of fundraising contrasts sharply to the other 30 
senators who have established campaign committees for a 1990 
reelection bid they have raised an average of nearly 750000 
each during the first six months of this year according to 
campaign disclosure reports filed at the federal election 
commission 
the numbers are more curious considering the 70yearold 
democrat is likely to face his toughest race since his hardfought 
1972 victory over republican john h chafee who won the states 
other senate seat four years later 
next year pell likely would face miss schneider who has all but 
announced a senate run 
miss schneider reported more than 200000 in campaign 
contributions to her house reelection committee for the 
januaryjune fec reporting period 
when he knows he could face someone as aggressive as claudine 
schneider i dont see how he can afford to take that passive 
attitude said wendy democker a spokeswoman for the national 
republican senatorial committee 
pell aides say the senators lack of fundraising is merely an 
outgrowth of his concern that the campaign season has become too 
long 
he has said repeatedly he has every intention of running 
said a senior pell aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
he just feels very strongly that the campaign process has gotten 
out of hand 
pell does have 444686 in his campaign coffers in preparation 
for 1990 but 21 of the 30 other senators running next year have 
more according to fec documents 
pell is one of the most popular politicians in rhode island 
history winning his senate seat in 1960 by defeating two former 
governors in a primary he has been a leading advocate for the arts 
and education and in 1986 became chairman of the powerful foreign 
relations committee 
but chairmen of that committee have in the past have suffered at 
reelection time attacked by challengers who charge they are 
paying too much attention to international problems and not enough 
to parochial concerns five years ago democrat paul simon unseated 
thenforeign relations chairman charles percy rill 
miss schneider has statewide recognition since rhode island has 
only two house seats and she is the type of republican that 
democraticdominated rhode island likes a liberal on social 
issues with a strong environmental record 
age also could become a factor miss schneider is 42 the same 
age pell was when he first came to the senate nearly 30 years ago 
pell will be 71 in november and would be 78 at the end of 
another sixyear term 
pell however would still be a youngster compared to his 
predecessor theodore green came to the senate at age 69 and 
retired in 1960 at age 93

farmers who grow socalled minor crops may 
want to band together to help pesticide manufacturers supply data 
needed to keep chemicals on the market says a spokesman for the 
national agricultural chemicals association 
manufacturers will not make pesticides that are not 
profitable said ray s mcallister director of regulatory 
affairs for the naca 
many pesticides used on minor crops are being dropped because of 
the high cost of tests needed to prove to the environmental 
protection agency that any residue left on the food is harmless to 
humans he said 
i dont envision the individual farmer getting involved 
said mcallister but there may be a group producing a specialty 
crop that could supply the resources for doing the tests he said 
examples of crops affected are berries cucumbers melons 
squashes kale mustard greens rutabaga spinach turnips 
asparagus celery lettuce onion peppers pimiento peanuts 
sunflowers kumquats papaya sugar beets and garlic 
an naca survey directed by mcallister found that manufacturers 
plan to cancel 20 commonly used pesticides because of the testing 
requirements while 39 others would be canceled for at least one 
food use cost of testing was the most frequently cited reason for 
dropping a chemical 
the testing requirement is mandated by the 1988 amendments to 
the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act 
this is the first time complete reregistration is being 
done said arthur grube economic analyst with the epa he said 
it is to be completed by 1997 
it is probable that some chemicals will disappear he said 
saying they would be the ones used in relatively small volumes 
which require significant testing 
but he said congress decided that if this stuff was going out 
into the environment it was worth it to know how safe it is 
he acknowledged that over the years laws have become more 
demanding because technology exists to research longterm health 
effects of chemical use instead of just the immediate result of 
exposure 
we are going to pay for it said grube but i think if you 
asked most people if they were willing to pay a dollar more for 
groceries to be assured the pesticide used on the food wouldnt 
cause cancer theyd pay it 
the epa has said it will try to be flexible with chemical 
manufacturers on some of the testing 
mcallister said for example if a chemical has already been 
tested on one kind of produce he has been told certain assumptions 
would be allowed without further tests on its effects on other 
foods 
meanwhile rep george brown dcalif will hold hearings next 
month on legislation that would speed up the removal of pesticides 
with proven health risks 
the bill would create a review process to continually upgrade 
health and safety information on pesticides and put an early 
warning system in place to keep agriculture research and 
extension work ahead of pesticide regulatory decisions he said 
it would change the cancellation process which currently 
requires administrative hearings and grants a transition period to 
farmers left with no pest control alternatives 
brown is chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee on 
department operations research and foreign agriculture

postal workers who tested positive for drug 
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired according to 
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the 
cost of workers drug use 
the analysis one of the first studies of its kind found that 
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40 
percent higher rate of being fired said researcher jacques normand 
results suggest that by spending about 18 million a year to 
screen job applicants for drugs the post office could avoid about 
31 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the 
first year he said over three years the avoided costs would 
surpass 17 million he said 
for private employers the study provides hard data showing that 
drug screening results are related to later job performance he 
said 
normand a senior industrial psychologist at the us postal 
service in washington presented the study sunday at the annual 
meeting of the american psychological association 
few welldesigned studies have examined the cost to employers of 
worker drug use commented steven gust of the national institute on 
drug abuse 
estimates have relied mostly on anecdotal information instead 
said gust who called normands work provocative 
normand said the post office is phasing in drug testing as part 
of its evaluation of job applicants 
results of the drug tests on people included in the study were 
not revealed to personnel officials to ensure that the results did 
not influence hiring decisions 
a total of 5465 applicants at 21 hiring sites across the 
country were screened by urine test for use of amphetamines 
barbiturates benzodiazepines cocaine marijuana methadone 
opiates and phencyclidine 
the job performance analysis focused on the 4220 applicants who 
were hired and completed a standard 90day probationary period of 
this group 373 had tested positive for at least one drug 
among those testing positive 251 showed evidence of marijuana 
use only and 88 for cocaine use with or without marijuana the 
others fell in other categories 
absenteeism was calculated as the percentage of assigned working 
hours that the employee was out sick absent without pay or absent 
without official leave the calculations were done after an average 
of eight months on the job 
workers who had tested positive for drug use were absent for an 
average of 42 percent of their assigned working hours in 
comparison to 3 percent for the other workers in the study normand 
said 
the difference per employee is small but it becomes more 
significant when applied to a large workforce gust of the drug 
institute said 
normand estimated that the greater absenteeism would cost the 
post office 26 million in one year when applied to workers hired 
that year 
he also said the cost probably would increase as workers stay on 
the payroll because new workers are encouraged not to take leave 
during their probationary period 
the study also found 13 percent of positivetesting employees 
had been fired compared to 95 percent of those who had tested 
negative 
gust said the study does not address the question of whether 
drug use directly affects performance on the job however drug 
test results may act as a proxy for some other behavioral or 
personality trait that affects job performance he said 
the study is a marvelous takeoff point for investigating 
that issue he said

its a question many pet owners would rather not 
ask what happens to the remains of the hundreds of thousands of 
dogs and cats that are destroyed each year 
part of the answer is clear though gruesome as many as a third 
wind up in rendering plants where their remains are broken down 
into a variety of products 
which products however is harder to say 
over the years various reports have traced pet remains to soap 
and cosmetics which are made with animal fats 
last week the wall street journal in an article on new york 
citys society for the prevention of cruelty to animals said 
unclaimed stray pets destroyed at the societys shelter are 
collected by a rendering plant in new jersey where they are 
boiled down to byproducts used in cosmetics and other products 
the article said a kitten could wind up as a bar of soap 
are new yorkers washing themselves with their former pets 
vito turso spokesman for the sanitation department said 
although the city pays 150000 a year to darlingdelaware inc to 
collect the carcasses he did not know what the renderer does with 
them 
the newark nj plant manager anton weir referred calls to 
john grayson division manager a halfdozen calls over three days 
to grayson were not returned 
what really happens to pet remains brought to rendering plants 
probably nothing sinister according to an industry spokesman 
dr russell john director of technical services for the 
national renderers association said almost all the small animals 
collected by renderers are turned into animal feed or fertilizer 
soaps and cosmetics require high quality white animal fats he 
explained those come mostly from cattle not dogs and cats and 
accordingly they are acquired from slaughterhouses not animal 
shelters 
gerald mcewen vice president for science with the cosmetic 
toiletry and fragrance association said it boggles the mind to 
think cat or dog remains would be used in cosmetics given 
manufacturers needs for pure beef tallow 
even if pet remains are not in personal cosmetics the problem 
of disposing of animal carcasses is a disturbing and persistent one 
for the nations animal shelters and veterinary facilities which 
have three options cremate the animals bury them in a sanitary 
landfill or turn them over to a renderer 
cremation is either illegal or impractical in many large cities 
including new york los angeles and washington and landfills are 
closing around the country 
that leaves renderers who cook down animal remains to obtain 
substances used in a variety of manufactured products in los 
angeles for example remains are used to make fertilizer 
such uses do offend some peoples sensibilities said 
barbara cassidy of the humane society of the united states 
but given the vast numbers of stray or unwanted pets that must 
be destroyed each year the los angeles county shelter alone puts 
about 25000 dogs and cats to sleep rendering is widely viewed as 
a form of recycling 
youre grateful if anyone will come and take the bodies 
away said ingrid newkirk director of people for the ethical 
treatment of animals and a former director of a washington dc 
animal shelter 
they dont keep well you have to put them in giant freezers 
its hideous a lousy lousy situation she said 
shelters that turn animal remains over to renderers usually 
offer pet owners an alternative including cremation and burial in 
a pet cemetery cremation costs between 35 and 50 but a casket 
and cemetery plot can cost more than 500 
a person who puts an animal up for adoption in a shelter is told 
the beast will be put to sleep if a suitable owner cannot be found 
within a few days 
but usually people dont want to deal with the remains 
said ed cubrda director of the los angeles spca a lot of people 
dont know what happens to them and a lot dont want to know

the leader of the social christian 
party says hell drop his bid for the presidency and back the head 
of the opposition la prensa newspaper if she is nominated by a 
national coalition group 
the opposition social christians one of the countrys 
bestorganized political groups on sunday nominated its leader 
erick ramirez as its candidate in the presidential election set for 
february by the leftist sandinista government 
but violeta barrios de chamorro director of la prensa has been 
mentioned as a possible candidate and has said she would accept the 
nomination by the 12party national opposition union if offered 
i would give up my candidacy and support her if the union 
nominates her ramirez a 45yearold businessman told the 
associated press by telephone 
the centerleft social christians founded in 1957 broke away 
from the national opposition union and is one of 21 parties 
ranging from communist to conservative registered in nicaragua 
the sandinista government of president daniel ortega has 
scheduled elections for feb 25 the elections are part of a pact 
reached by five central american presidents that includes an 
agreement for the disbanding of nicaraguan rebels 
the sandinistas have not yet announced their nominee 
luis vega miranda a social christian spokesman said that in 
addition to nominating ramirez the party convention approved a 
platform to create a government based on the search for a 
democratic society and community dignity liberty and personal 
freedom 
the platform calls for an economic system neither capitalist 
nor communist an end to conscription independence from the 
superpowers abolition of repressive organizations and agrarian 
reform he said

amnesty for contras who return home and electoral and press freedom

by helping to invent the transistor 
william shockley did as much to shape the modern world as louis 
pasteur or madame curie colleagues said but he died with a 
reputation tarnished by his controversial racial theories 
shockley who shared the 1956 nobel prize for physics died 
saturday of prostate cancer at his home on the campus of stanford 
university the university said sunday he was 79 
he was among the fathers of the electronic age but spent his 
later years embroiled in controversy over his theory that 
intelligence is genetically based and that blacks as a group are 
inferior to whites 
i would say he would have to be compared to people who opened 
up huge new areas such as pasteur or the salk vaccine said 
professor william e spicer shockleys friend and colleague for 33 
years 
but certainly the controversies he got into later in life made 
it much more difficult for him to get recognition for his key 
contribution said spicer a professor of electrical engineering 
at stanford 
shockley shared the nobel prize with his colleagues from bell 
laboratories john bardeen and the late walter h brattain he also 
was professor emeritus of electrical engineering at stanford 
the teams first device developed during what they later called 
a magic month during 1947 was an innovation that made vacuum 
tubes obsolete and the electronic age possible most modern 
devices from airplanes to wristwatches to computers contain the 
technical descendants of shockleys work 
shockley semiconductor laboratories the company he founded 
after leaving bell labs in 1954 was instrumental in the birth of 
silicon valley and the electronics industry his former employees 
later invented the integrated circuit and the microprocessor the 
building blocks of the computer age 
its a great loss for stanford said joseph w goodman 
chairman of the schools electrical engineering department 
shockley has made the most important revolution in the 20th 
century makoto kikuchi the executive technical adviser of sony 
corp who has known shockely since 1960 said in an interview he 
had not imagined his invention would lead to such a rapid 
revolution in electronics 
shockleys sparked campus demonstrations by claiming that 
intellectually inferior blacks were producing children faster than 
mentally superior whites his genetic theories also prompted debate 
over the use of iq tests in schools and over why blacks failed to 
score as well as whites most experts have blamed this outcome on 
biased tests and other factors not related to genetics 
many of shockleys scientific colleagues ridiculed his racial 
theories and abandoned their association with him claiming he had 
passed beyond his field of expertise and was acting irresponsibly 
in his later years shockley tried several times to befriend 
blacks he came into contact with spicer said i think he very 
much would have liked to have found a black person who would be a 
personal friend he said 
a 1980 article in the atlanta constitution comparing shockleys 
theories to nazism drew a libel suit from shockley who sued the 
newspaper for 125 million a federal jury awarded him 1 in the 
case and the us supreme court in 1986 turned down shockleys 
attempt to revive the lawsuit 
shockleys wife emmy said he considered his research on 
intelligence his most valuable work and that he continued to write 
papers on the subject until a few days before his death 
at the age of 68 he contributed his sperm to a sperm bank in 
southern california that founders said was designed to help pass on 
the genetic makeup of geniuses 
shockley whose father was a mining engineer and whose 
grandfather was a whaling captain was born in london and grew up 
in palo alto near the campus where he died 
he was one of the children tested in louis termans classic 
study of gifted children but failed to test high enough to advance 
to the followup study he was fond of pointing out that terman 
passed over two later nobel prize winners 
shockley received his phd in the thenesoteric field of 
solidstate physics from the massachusetts institute of technology 
in 1932 and joined the staff of american telephone amp telegraph 
cos bell laboratories in murray hill nj in 1936 
after a year of working on vacuum tubes as replacements for 
mechanical switches in telephone exchanges shockley resumed his 
research on how electrons behaved with crystals he met brattain 
through that work 
world war ii put a stop to the research shockley went to work 
for the government and did not return to bell labs until 1945 
about the time that bardeen joined 
with shockley and bardeen as theoreticians and brattain as the 
experimenter the team resumed efforts to create a solidstate 
device that would amplify electronic signals like the more 
vulnerable bulkier and powerhungry vacuum tubes of the day 
research teams at mit general electric purdue university and the 
university of pennsylvania also were in the race 
on dec 23 1947 the bell labs team conducted the first 
successful demonstration of a crude transistor a pair of metal 
cats whiskers 2000th of an inch apart stuck into a slab of 
germanium 
shockley is survived by his wife three children from a previous 
marriage two sons william and richard and a daughter alison 
ianelli and one granddaughter

a city that thought itself free of the worst of 
bigcity problems has witnessed a summer of driveby shootings 
murders and drug running with violent crime nearly double what it 
was a year ago 
queen hyler whose son was beaten unconscious by a street gang 
says milwaukee residents are fed up 
its going to be turned around in milwaukee people are not 
going to put up with this said ms hyler and im prepared to 
die for it i refuse to give one inch to the drug dealers 
the sudden outbreak of violence and illegal drugs has shocked 
residents of this city which has strong ethnic roots a tradition 
of progressive government and a history of low crime rates 
through the first seven months of 1989 there were 69 murders 
compared to 54 for the same period last year there were 1020 
violent crimes through july 1 compared to 565 for the first six 
months of 1988 
acting police chief leroy a jahnke said the majority of the 
citys violence has been drugrelated 
jahnke has increased overtime staffing putting 48 more officers 
on the streets between 10 pm and 2 am when many shootings have 
occurred a new system that will allow clerks to write reports 
formerly written by police officers should put 100 more officers on 
the streets 
to curb the growing supply of arms on city streets alderwoman 
larraine mcnamaramcgraw said she would support an ordinance 
banning the sale of smallcaliber weapons 
she also praised a program introduced in late july by mayor john 
o norquist encouraging residents to turn in unwanted firearms to 
police stations 
after her teenage son byron was severely beaten by gang members 
last year ms hyler took to social activism and became president 
of the people united association 
her group has staged marches and vigils this summer to call 
attention to the growing crime problems in milwaukee particularly 
on the highly segregated north side where most of the citys black 
population lives 
ms hyler said she worked hard to make a home in milwaukee and 
she will not let drugs ruin her neighborhood 
somebody has to move and im not going she said 
still she said fighting the image of the drug dealer is often 
difficult because it frequently takes a few years for authorities 
to convict a violator by that time she said young people have 
already been dazzled by the dealers mercedes gold chains and 
other luxuries 
its hard to tell a kid thats not the right road she said 
noting that working for the minimum wage of 365 an hour is not an 
attractive alternative to the lucrative drug business 
in addition to its lobbying efforts people united offers young 
people scholarships group discussion sessions and constructive 
youth recreation 
we try to make kids feel good about themselves and give 
them good role models she said 
ms mcnamaramcgraw agreed with that approach 
she said education can raise young peoples sense of dignity 
and can dissuade youths from buying into the drug world 
were a salvageable city she said

the battle over health insurance costsharing that 
helped spark phone workers strikes in 20 states is likely to crop 
up in many industries in the 1990s according to business and labor 
officials 
fifty percent of the union leaders and 38 percent of the 
business leaders surveyed in a recent study commissioned by 
metropolitan life insurance co said employee payments for health 
insurance would be one of the top six negotiating priorities for 
this year 
health care has been a major issue on the bargaining table and 
as we progress into the 90s it will become the no 1 or no 2 
issue lorrie mchugh a spokeswoman for the aflcio in 
washington said friday 
it certainly does seem to be a trend that will be a major 
focal point with the rate health care costs are growing said 
karen brigham of the chamber of commerce of the united states 
health insurance has been the principal bargaining issue in the 
contract talks among the seven baby bells and the unions that 
represent their more than 300000 workers 
workers at nynex corp bell atlantic corp and pacific telesis 
went on strike last week and workers struck ameritech on sunday 
workers and company officials reached agreement at bellsouth 
southwestern bell telephone co and u s west in the latter two 
strikes were averted when the companies agreed to surrender their 
demands that workers pay a share of health insurance premiums 
which up to now had been 100 percent company paid 
earlier this year atampt averted a threatened strike by 
abandoning demands that workers pay a share of health premiums 
ms brigham said health care costs have been rising at more than 
twice the rate of inflation in the past few years 
employers realize they cannot absorb these increases year 
after year and remain competitive she said part of the 
solution is to inject a little more individual responsibility into 
the picture 
ms mchugh agreed on the need to get health care costs under 
control but disagreed on the solution 
we recognize the fact that as health care costs continue to 
escalate there needs to be an equitable solution but if you 
continue to shift the burden you create barriers to care for many 
working americans she said 
the aflcios preferred solution she said is a national health 
insurance plan she said the umbrella labor organization will start 
a campaign in november for an overhaul of the nations health care 
system 
myles calvey business manager of the quincy massbased local 
2222 of the international brotherhood of electrical workers said 
nynex was profitable enough to be able to pay its workers health 
insurance coverage 
but peter cronin a spokesman for new england telephone a 
division of nynex said the company would be unusual if it 
continued providing full health insurance coverage at no cost to 
the workers 
the way things have developed because of the high costs of 
medical care about 80 percent of the businesses in the country 
require some kind of copayment the unusual thing is we have been 
able to continue full payment as long as we have cronin said

boating in florida has never been more 
popular or more deadly as boats race at speeds up to 100 mph in 
crowded waterways threatening other boaters and wildlife like the 
manatee 
now the state that has led the nation in recreational boating 
deaths for the past two years is trying to establish a boating 
speed limit require more education and charge higher license fees 
to bring the boating explosion under control 
there are some 700000 boat owners in the state seven times 
the number of registered boaters in 1961 and that figure is 
expected to double in the next 10 years according to florida 
marine patrol estimates many boaters strongly oppose any new 
regulations 
the boating fatality rate in florida is 2 times the national 
average with the number of deaths soaring from 40 in 1986 to 102 
in 1987 and 105 last year 
the recent outcry for greater regulation was sparked by a 
memorial day weekend collision along the intercoastal waterway in 
pinellas county that killed four teenagers 
dr william latorre 48 was arrested tuesday and charged with 
four counts of manslaughter by culpable negligence after his sleek 
35foot boat collided with a 17foot boat carrying five teenagers 
on the states west coast near st petersburg 
this week the heads of state agencies will hold public hearings 
in orlando on a proposal by the department of natural resources to 
set a statewide speed limit of 30 mph and 20 mph in 12 counties 
heavily populated by manatees the proposed speed limits are 
scheduled to be voted on at a sept 14 cabinet meeting 
i think theres not a lot of sentiment right now for a 
statewide speed zone said sally munroe an aide to gov bob 
martinez 
marjorie lamphear education director of save the manatee club 
in maitland says the lower speed limits proposed for the 12 
counties could help the manatee a large sea mammal also known as 
sea cows 
manatees do recognize danger and try to get out of the way 
she said but between a speeding boat and a slow manatee the 
combination is not in favor of the manatee 
between january and july 103 manatees have been found dead 
with 37 deaths attributed to vessels according the natural 
resources department during the same period last year 29 of 93 
manatee deaths were blamed on boaters an estimated 1200 of the 
docile planteating creatures weighing more than 3000 pounds and 
ranging from eight to 14 feet long live in florida 
we could lose 150 this year ms lamphear said we need to 
take drastic measures 
next month the natural resources department will ask the 
governor and his cabinet for mandatory education for boaters and 
higher license fees to help pay for better enforcement of boating 
laws according to a draft report released last week by the agency 
some view the proposed regulations as an unnecessary intrusion 
last spring the legislature rejected a boating safety bill that 
included a statewide speed limit 
why the heck should the government be sticking its nose in 
something that should be individually involved asked state rep 
jim king 
jim robinson state executive director of the marine industries 
association doubts a 30 mph speed limit will lower the number of 
deaths 
speed isnt the prime factor behind boating deaths he 
contended they also were caused by lack of life jackets 
overloaded craft carelessness and bad weather conditions he said 
robinson called the proposed regulations an imposition on the 
public and warned you better believe theres going to be a 
battle 
but col don ellingsen director of the florida marine patrol 
said the regulations are needed because of the increasing 
congestion on florida waterways and the increase in speed 
we dont believe that 30 mph will affect the vast majority of 
boat owners he said we are trying to slow down the floating 
rockets that go 80 to 100 mph

a firebomb set a car ablaze 
today and injured the four israelis inside the army said 
witnesses in this town north of jerusalem said the four were tax 
collectors riding in a car belonging to israels tax department 
when at least two firebombs were thrown at the vehicle 
an army spokesman said the injured were civilians but declined 
to say whether they worked with the tax department 
ramallah and neighboring el bireh both about eight miles north 
of jerusalem have recently been the scenes of battles over 
nonpayment of taxes as part of the 20month palestinian uprising 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
withholding taxes has been a major tactic of the uprising and 
earlier this month merchants in the area staged a oneday general 
strike to protest the governments seizure of their identity papers 
to force payment of taxes 
two of the victims suffered moderate to serious burns and two 
were slightly injured according to a spokesman at hadassah 
hospital in the jerusalem suburb of ein karem 
soldiers clamped a curfew on the area where the firebomb was 
thrown and began rounding up suspects 
an army spokesman who is not identified under military 
regulations would not say how many were arrested but at least 
eight youths were seen in the custody of soldiers 
soldiers also began welding shut at least 10 neighborhood shops 
which the army commonly does as punishment when firebombs or stones 
cause injuries 
the army spokesman said two youths threw two or three firebombs 
at the car on palestine street near the kadoura refugee camp in 
an area where stones and bottles have frequently been thrown at 
israeli vehicles 
after the incident soldiers also seized identity cards and 
videotapes from two palestinians who work as parttime cameramen 
for television networks 
also in the west bank masked youths set ablaze a bus carrying 
arab workers to jobs in israel israel radio said no one was 
reported injured in the attack in nablus the west banks largest 
city 
at least 536 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
soldiers or israeli civilians during the uprising thirtyeight 
israelis also have been slain

if you have something awesome to 
sell to kids forget it 
and dont say fresh because that bit of kidspeak is rapidly 
going stale 
the dweebs at the ad agencies dont always know it but 
appropriating teenage slang for commercial purposes is like 
totally risky as sure as this years stonewashed jeans become 
next years bell bottoms the oddsounding usages of youth can 
tumble from the cutting edge to oblivion before they reach the ears 
of adults 
thats where karen forcade of youth research a consulting 
company comes in 
companies such as colgatepalmolive johnson amp johnson nabisco 
and campbells soup hire forcade 45 to tell them how to 
communicate with younger consumers 
children are very sensitive to the language that is used 
forcade said adding that they regard ad writers who sling outmoded 
terms at them as dweebs the latest word for nerds or 
geeks a current toy commercial in which the child actor 
exclaims awesome for instance is regarded as just awful 
the lingo of youth is evanescent a recent alternative to 
cool cropped up some years ago in radical later shortened 
to rad that gave way to critical shortened naturally to 
crit now both terms are passe 
maureen leopold a counselor at danbury high school warns that 
adults would be wise to leave kidspeak to the kids lest they 
stumble embarrass themselves and attain dweebhood

twenty months have passed since a debate 
by six democratic presidential candidates at pan american 
university but the judges who agreed to pay for the event still 
owe 9100 
the university turned to a collection agency last week after its 
repeated failure to get the southwest texas county judges 
association to pay 
zapata county judge angel a flores was the only one of the 29 
judges sponsoring the event who had paid his bill by then a second 
judge hidalgo county judge j edgar ruiz paid his share on 
thursday 
ruiz whose county hosted the dec 15 1987 event said the 
judges always intended to pay the bill but somehow put it aside 
and just never got to it 
he said university officials have been more than patient with 
us 
the candidates who took part in the debate were massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis tennessee sen albert gore sen paul simon 
of illinois the rev jesse jackson former arizona gov bruce 
babbitt and missouri rep richard gephardt 
pan american spokesman bruce erickson said university policy 
prohibits the statesupported school from sponsoring partisan 
activities but that such activities are permitted when paid for by 
offcampus groups

the area contaminated by the chernobyl nuclear 
accident will be made a sanctuary to study such phenomena as 
strangely heavy pine needles and rodents with genetic 
abnormalities the official tass news agency said today 
three regions of byelorussia that were evacuated after the 1986 
accident will be set aside for scientists to observe how radiation 
affects plants and wildlife tass said some sections of the 
ukraine on the other side of chernobyl are already study areas 
tass said pine needles in parts of the poisoned forests remained 
normal size but were ten times heavier than normal and that some 
conifers had frown into giants 
scientists found high radiation levels in reservoirs and 
especially high levels in fish that feed off other fish including 
pike and perch 
although some rodents developed genetic abnormalities no 
marked changes occurred in their condition and behavior tass 
said 
among mammals wild boars foxes and rabbits showed the highest 
radiation readings but scientists observed no abnormal behavior 
among them tass said 
the explosion and fire at the northern ukraine nuclear plants 
no 4 reactor april 26 1986 killed 31 people and released a cloud 
of radioactive material that eventually circled the globe more 
than three years later the effects continue to be felt 
last week tass reported that 3000 people are preparing to 
evacuate a small section of russia near the power plant where 
radiation has doubled the amount of illness it did not specify 
which illnesses became more common 
the report followed a dispute between the government and 
scientists in byelorussia about further evacuations byelorussian 
officials say an extra 11000 people should be evacuated but 
scientists say some 106000 should be removed based on radiation 
levels in the area 
about 130000 people have already been evacuated from the 
vicinity of the plant

an airline official said there was no connection 
between the tail engine failure that forced a continental airlines 
727 to abort a takeoff and recent tail engine problems in dc10 
jetliners 
an official at boeing co the aircrafts maker said sundays 
incident was very unusual and added that the company would 
want to investigate it 
fan blades and other metal pieces of the pratt amp whitney engine 
on the boeing 727200 were scattered over a runway at stapleton 
international airport after the planes no 2 engine disintegrated 
no one was injured 
the runway was closed for about 90 minutes and the 128 
passengers on the plane bound for portland were put on another 
flight there also were seven crew members aboard when the engine 
failed 
ron holthouser a retired american airlines pilot from oakridge 
ore said he heard a loud mechanical scream and a pop from the 
rear engine during the acceleration for liftoff 
luckily it happened on the ground but it was nip and tuck 
there holthouser said 
he did the right thing he said referring to the pilots 
decision to abort takeoff i give him all the credit in the 
world it was a snap judgment and they didnt have much runway 
left 
the no 2 engine is mounted in the fuselage the 727 also has 
two other engines mounted near the rear of the aircraft and it can 
take off with just two engines although it is designed to take off 
with all three continental spokesman ned walker said 
the no 2 engine has come under scrutiny recently in dc10 
aircraft made by mcdonnell douglas which are larger than 727s 
but walker said there is no comparison whatsoever to the dc10 
question 
on july 19 a united air lines dc10 bound for chicago from 
denver crashed in an iowa cornfield while attempting an emergency 
landing at the sioux city airport its tail engine exploded in 
midflight apparently severing hydraulic lines that control the 
wing and tail flaps the crash killed 111 people but 185 survived 
last week a northwest airlines dc10 made an emergency landing 
in denver on its way to minneapolis from los angeles after its no 
2 tail engine apparently started disintegrating in flight nicking 
the hydraulic lines but not severing them 
on friday a third dc10 bound for denver aborted takeoff in 
boston because of a stalled compressor in the tailmounted engine 
officials said 
walker said engine pieces did not perforate the engines outer 
cover in sundays incident 
because there were no injuries reported and the engine failure 
was contained inside the covering walker said an investigation by 
federal authorities was not required 
but tom cole a boeing spokesman in seattle said a contained 
engine failure in a 727 was rare and investigators from the 
company the ntsb pratt amp whitney and continental would want to 
examine the engine 
it is very unusual to have an engine do that on a 727 cole 
said i cant remember the last time it happened if it actually 
ever happened at all

a republican received the highest number of votes 
in a special election to replace jim wright in congress but the 
top democratic finisher predicted a victory in the runoff 
republican bob lanier received 21978 ballots or 39 percent of 
the vote in saturdays special election for the 12th district seat 
surrendered by wright but democrat pete geren was elated with his 
32 percent showing 17751 votes 
geren a fort worth attorney got quick endorsements from both 
wright and from democrat jim lane who finished third in the race 
and with 22 percent of the vote was the only other candidate to 
garner more than 3 percent 
a runoff is necessary because no one in the eightcandidate race 
to replace wright received a simple majority 
geren received a ringing endorsement from wright who resigned 
the seat june 30 after an ethics investigation uncovered 69 
instances of alleged house violations 
i want to ask all of you to redouble your efforts because 
heres a man i want to be my successor wright told supporters at 
a victory party late saturday he is steeped in the traditions of 
our state and country 
wright first won election in 1955 and was reelected 17 times in 
the next 34 years he received 88 writein votes in the special 
election after telling constituents he was not interested in 
trying to win back the seat 
the elections administrator asked gov bill clements to schedule 
the runoff for sept 9 the runoff must be called 20 to 30 days 
after the state canvasses the votes a process that probably will 
be completed in a week 
meanwhile dallas voters approved by a 2to1 margin a proposal 
to reorganize the structure of city council the proposal received 
41456 votes to 20823 against 
the socalled 1041 proposal called for expanding the 
council from 11 members to 15 with 10 elected from singlemember 
districts four from overlapping super districts and the mayor 
elected citywide currently eight members of council are elected 
from singlemember districts and three including the mayor are 
elected at large 
proponents said the plan would give minorities a greater voice 
in city government opponents said it would dilute minority voting 
power others said the plan wouldnt substantially change the 
ethnic makeup of council districts 
and dallas area rapid transit officials won a significant battle 
when voters in four of five dallas suburbs decided to retain the 
agency about onefifth of transit agencys sales tax income was 
riding on the five suburban elections as was the fate of a truly 
regional transportation system

space shuttle columbias astronauts 
were tightlipped after returning to earth from a military mission 
believed to include the deployment of a spy satellite and tests of 
star wars equipment 
we had a great time air force col mark brown said after 
the columbia glided to a pinpoint landing at edwards air force 
base calif early sunday 
neither he nor the four other astronauts had much else to say 
about the fiveday onehour and 56minute flight the first for 
nasas oldest shuttle in more than 3 years 
the crew was resting today but will return to the johnson space 
center on tuesday for briefings about the flight 
the five astronauts and their wives returned home to houston on 
sunday afternoon they were greeted at ellington field by their 
families and about 300 cheering friends and coworkers 
it wasnt nice it was fantastic pilot richard richards a 
navy commander and one of three space rookies on the flight told 
the crowd 
our mission went perfectly smooth said brown a mission 
specialist and another firsttimer in space the vehicle was 
flawless 
a news blackout ordered by the department of defense prevailed 
over the flight and only a few brief announcements broke the 
silence even the landing was closed to the public 
the main goal of the mission was widely believed to be 
deployment of a powerful 10ton spy satellite that can snap highly 
detailed photographs of military installations troop movements and 
other targets around the world such a satellite would help the 
united states verify soviet compliance with arms treaties 
air force secretary donald rice confirmed last week that the 
astronauts had deployed a satellite several hours after blastoff 
tuesday from cape canaveral fla but he would not elaborate about 
its purpose 
the astronauts also were believed to have conducted star 
wars experiments and to have performed tests aimed at determining 
the feasibility of monitoring military sites from space 
columbia was commanded by air force col brewster shaw a 
veteran of two previous shuttle flights the crew also included 
mission specialists navy cmdr david leestma who flew one previous 
flight and army lt col james adamson 
the orbiter sustained little damage to its protective tiles and 
no tiles appeared to be missing said ed jenner shuttle support 
manager for the air force at edwards 
the flight was the first for columbia since january 1986 when 
the spaceship flew on a mission that landed just 10 days before the 
challenger explosion which killed seven astronauts 
columbia had remained in the hangar while the two newer 
shuttles discovery and atlantis made two trips each since manned 
missions resumed last september columbia eventually was 
overhauled undergoing more than 250 modifications 
the mission was the 30th shuttle flight overall three more 
shuttle flights are planned this year and nine are scheduled in 
1990

a total lunar eclipse visible from five 
continents occurs after sunset wednesday when the full moon orbits 
into the shadow of the earth and slowly turns from a bright silver 
into a copper or orange disk 
more than a billion people will have a chance to watch as the 
moon appears to be slowly nibbled away changing from the normal 
bright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow of 
eclipse 
the celestial show starts at 823 pm edt over the united 
states and will end about 5 hours later the eastern united states 
will get the best viewing and alaska will miss the eclipse 
altogether 
visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western 
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and 
moonrise in los angeles for instance the eclipse will have 
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen by the time 
the sky has darkened completely in california the moon will 
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse for seattle the 
moon will still be below the horizon at mideclipse but will rise 
during the totality phase 
clouds of course could ruin the viewing at any location 
with clear skies though some phase of the celestial spectacle 
should be visible to observers in north and south america western 
europe and africa and the antarctic sailors at sea in the 
atlantic and in the eastern pacific ocean also will be able to see 
part of the eclipse weather permitting 
a lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadow 
created by the earth blocking the suns light the moon in its 
orbit of the earth usually passes above or below this shadowline 
but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely in 
shade for a time when the whole moon passes through the shadow it 
is called a total eclipse 
the last total lunar eclipse visible over most of north america 
occurred in december 1982 and the next one is not until december 
1992 
astronomers are forecasting that wednesdays eclipse may be a 
bright one 
the moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery red 
if there is clear clean air between the lunar surface and the 
observer on earth if smoke or dust obscure the view the moon will 
diminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from view 
altogether 
volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing by 
dumping tons of dust into the atmosphere but astronomers say 
enough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption that 
most dust has settled 
the eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called the 
penumbra this outer fringe of the earths shadow will show up on 
the moon as a grayish shading after about half an hour the moon 
will edge into the umbra the dark central part of the shadow 
total eclipse when all of the moon is covered by the umbra will 
begin at about 1020 pm edt and last for one hour 36 minutes 
when the moon leaves the umbra the events will occur in reverse 
order the eclipse ends about 153 am edt when the moon edges out 
of the shadow altogether 
while a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth blocks sunlight from 
the moon a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlight 
from the earth 
to experts a solar eclipse is more interesting because it 
permits unique measurements of the sun 
solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention said 
john bangert a us naval observatory astronomer in washington 
a lunar eclipse is just a good show 
here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur all 
times are eastern daylight 
moon enters penumbra 823 pm 
moon enters umbra 921 pm 
moon enters totality 1020 pm 
middle of eclipse 1108 pm 
moon leaves totality 1156 pm 
moon leaves umbra 1256 am thursday 
moon leaves penumbra 153 am 
because of the differences in sunset and moonrise times viewing 
will start at different eclipse phases in the western parts of the 
country 
here are times for the local events that affect eclipse viewing 
the first hour is for local sunset and the second is for local 
moonrise the best viewing will follow twilight which ends about 25 
minutes after sunset local time zones apply in all cases 
baltimore sunset at 8 pm moonrise at 753 pm 
boston 743 pm and 736 pm 
chicago 749 pm and 743 pm 
cleveland 825 pm and 818 pm 
houston 801 pm and 755 pm

irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei said today that iran will never hold talks with the 
united states hours earlier iran renewed an offer to help free 
western hostages in lebanon 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
reported in a commentary late sunday that tehran was ready to use 
its maximum influence for the release of all hostages if the 
united states freed iranian assets worth billions of dollars it 
froze 10 years ago 
but tehran radio also monitored in cyprus quoted khamenei 
today as saying no iranian leader will negotiate with the united 
states 
next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied palestine you 
are the most cursed government in the eyes of the iranian people 
no one in the islamic republic will hold talks with you the 
radio quoted khamenei as telling us leaders 
khamenei has been seen as a socalled moderate in iran 
interested in restoring the countrys ties with the west his 
comments underlined the divisions in tehran over whether iran 
should help free the western hostages in lebanon 
in lebanon america commits the greatest atrocities and 
encourages its puppet israel in kidnapping and hostagetaking 
khamenei said referring to israels abduction july 28 of sheik 
abdul karim obeid a shiite moslem clergyman 
khamenei did not specifically mention the westerners held 
hostage most are held by proiranian shiite moslem fundamentalists 
khamenei was elected irans religious leader to succeed 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 at that time he was 
clearly allied with parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani the 
leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists who favor rebuilding 
bridges with the west 
rafsanjani who was elected irans president has made clear in 
recent days that dialogue with the united states on freeing the 
hostages is possible he was behind the clandestine 
armsforhostages deal with the united states in 198586 during 
which three american hostages were freed 
but rafsanjanis radical rivals in tehran led by interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi have said they oppose any dealings 
with the united states 
us and western intelligence officials have said mohtashemi was 
closely linked with the formation of hezbollah the radical group 
believed to be the umbrella for factions holding foreign hostages 
the irna commentary sunday said the united states must pressure 
israel to free obeid and secure the release of three iranians 
missing in lebanon since 1982 and all lebanese captives held by 
israel 
the israelis said they kidnapped obeid to arrange a swap with 
three israeli servicemen held in lebanon they later widened the 
offer to include the release of western hostages 
hezbollah has ruled out any exchange of the israeli prisoners 
until obeid is released 
the sunday times of london reported sunday that israeli 
investigators who have questioned obeid believe two of the israeli 
soldiers are dead 
israels chief army spokesman brig gen ephraim lapid said he 
refuses to accept that 
my consideration is that they are alive and we must do our 
utmost to bring them home lapid told a news conference sunday 
we consider our prisoners of war as living until positive 
evidence proves the contrary lapid said 
the sunday times quoted unidentified senior israeli government 
sources as saying obeids interrogators believe two israeli 
infantrymen yousef fink and rahamim alsheik died of wounds within 
hours after their car was ambushed in south lebanon in february 
1986 
the hostages in lebanon include eight americans the hostage 
held longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the irna commentary sunday said the hostages are not held by 
iran but by unknown and underground groups 
it said that the influence iran has on these groups is merely 
spiritual which in certain cases in the past has proved 
effective

police fired plastic bullets at 
rioting youths in mainly roman catholic west belfast today the 
20th anniversary of the arrival of british troops in northern 
ireland 
a police spokesman said many of those involved in the 
disturbances were young and he urged parents to keep their children 
indoors 
their parents have a responsibility to keep them off the 
streets and out of trouble he said speaking anonymously in 
keeping with british custom 
there were no reported injuries in disturbances that started 
about 615 am said a spokesman for the royal ulster 
constabulary northern irelands police force 
two buses and a truck were hijacked and set on fire said the 
spokesman bus service to the area was cut off for two hours to 
prevent more hijackings he said 
chief constable hugh annesley appealed sunday for calm across 
northern ireland during events today marking the day british troops 
entered londonderry two decades ago to separate rebellious 
catholics from charging police troops moved into belfast a day 
later 
i would like to see parents keep their children in said 
annesley i would like community leaders church leaders 
politicians of all persuasions to encourage those in the community 
from one side to the other to please keep calm to avoid being 
provoked and to let this very difficult time pass by 
protestants marched saturday in a parade in londonderry to mark 
the 300th anniversary of a defeat over the catholic king james ii 
and catholics marched sunday up the falls road in west belfast 
republicans planned to gather in londonderry tonight to march 
through waterloo place where british soldiers first arrived at 5 
pm on aug 14 1969 after sectarian riots had engulfed the city 
for two days and nights 
gerry adams president of sinn fein the legal political wing of 
the outlawed irish republican army told sundays marchers 
we have a lot to be proud of because we have come a long way 
in 20 years our opponents have failed to defeat us 
adams praised the ira as the real freedom fighters 
bernadette devlin mcaliskey a leader in the catholic civil 
rights marches of the 1960s told the cheering crowd 
the british army came in 19 and 69 not because we were being 
attacked but because for the first time since the beginning of 
this state this misbegotten tuppence hapenny bastardized state 
we were fighting back 
the reasons they are still here 20 years after is because we 
are still fighting back she said 
looking back over 20 years mrs mcaliskey complained that 
catholics still suffer more unemployment than protestants local 
government was powerless and the rights of criminal defendants 
including the right to silence have been eroded 
everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them mrs 
mcaliskey said yet it was nothing because every time we gained 
something they clawed it back 
the thousands who marched up the falls road to andersonstown on 
sunday represent only a minority within northern irelands roman 
catholic community in election after election sinn fein has 
pulled about half as many votes as the social democratic and labor 
party which is committed to peaceful change 
security was strict along the parade route annesley appointed 
last year to head the royal ulster constabulary surprised sinn 
fein by coming in person later he complimented the organizers for 
a wellrun parade 
on saturday annesleys men discovered an ira bomb in 
londonderry that exploded before it could be defused no one was 
injured but a building was destroyed 
more than 2700 people twothirds of them civilians have died 
in 20 years of violence in northern ireland which is divided 
between catholics who generally favor a united ireland and 
protestants who support continued british rule

students at two beijing universities at the hub 
of last springs prodemocracy movement returned to their campuses 
today for mandatory political education before resuming regular 
studies 
the campuses of qinghua university and the china peoples 
university bustled with students rushing to classes and picking up 
old friendships 
however there were no overt signs of the activism of april and 
may when students boycotted classes to press their demands for 
more democratic government 
the student activists were at the center of a movement that 
confronted the ruling communist party with its demands for more 
democracy authorities finally put down the protests in june 
killing at least 200 people and carrying out a nationwide wave of 
arrests 
since then officials have taken additional measures to gain 
control over the unruly student population 
officials at beijing university said firstyear students at that 
school would be required to undergo a year of military training and 
cultural studies before beginning their academic work 
previously they were required to take only two weeks of military 
training 
universities throughout china have reinstated political 
education which was largely ignored in recent years in an effort 
to prevent more student unrest 
most students went home for summer vacation in june but 
graduating seniors were required to take several weeks of political 
education and write essays of selfcriticism before receiving 
their diplomas 
the political crackdown and arrests have had a tangible impact 
on the universities which buzzed with political broadcasts and 
discussions last spring 
prodemocracy posters plastered on dormitories have been scraped 
off bulletin boards now carry a few ads and class announcements 
during a boycott of classes last spring students often gathered 
to discuss the prodemocracy movement 
today the few students who lingered outside their dorms were 
subdued and cautious everythings just fine here one young 
woman no problems 
upperclassmen at most universities in beijing will return to 
campus by early september and freshman students will begin their 
studies about a month later 
beijing colleges that led the student movement have had their 
freshman enrollments cut by half or more in a move linked to the 
protests nationwide the number of firstyear students has been 
cut by 30000 to 610000 
officials have arrested at least seven of 21 beijing university 
students sought for involvement in the spring protests at least 
two have fled the country

an american said today hell go home 
later this week unless the weather improves and allows him to make 
an attempt to become the first paraplegic to swim the english 
channel 
robert patterson of maryland ny has been waiting at a 
folkestone hotel for one week to attempt the 20mile crossing from 
england to cap gris nez france 
i just cant believe that this is happening he said today 
of the weather i trained for this for two years i put my heart 
and soul into it 
winds in the channel today were 20 mph and waves were three to 
five feet high the conditions were much too rough for 
swimmers said ray scott chairman of the channel swimming 
association that authenticates the swims 
its a conspiracy of the fates scott said but its no 
use swimming in high winds you get buffeted about in high waves 
weather forecasts were boding early improvement scott said 
patterson said if he cant swim tuesday or wednesday he will 
return home 
i cant get any more demoralized than i am now he said 
it was excellent weather most of the summer so this is kind of a 
shock 
patterson 33 became a paraplegic three years ago when he fell 
25 feet from a scaffold on a construction site the accident broke 
his spine and paralyzed him from the waist down 
he swam eight miles across otsego lake in upstate new york last 
year in six hours 48 minutes this june he swam the lake again 
going nine miles while shaving one hour two minutes off his time 
pattersons training includes weightlifting in the fall and 
winter and swimming in the st lawrence river on weekends in the 
summer he also takes daily swims in an indoor pool or a local lake 
two other paraplegics have attempted to swim the english channel 
but failed 
patterson said if thwarted by the weather this time he doubts 
hell come back for another attempt 
a 27yearold woman trying to become the first handicapped woman 
to swim the channel is also waiting for the weather to improve 
scott said 
lucyna krajewska who has had both legs amputated attempted the 
crossing in 1987 but gave up after covering only six miles in seven 
hours 
ms krajewska who was born in poland defected to west germany 
six years ago she won the gold medal in the 100meter freestyle 
swim at the paraolympics in seoul last year

one of the most widely used psychological 
tests in the world has undergone a personality change after about 
50 years 
the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory administered 
millions of times a year to job applicants and others has been 
updated to reflect 1980s attitudes and ailments 
for instance it no longer asks test subjects if they enjoyed 
reading alice in wonderland the test has also done away with 
male pronouns in questions pertaining to both sexes no longer 
assuming for example that political candidates are male in a 
question about voting habits 
among questions removed were those about religion sexual 
preference and bodily functions such as excretion several 
references that researchers thought were anachronisms were deleted 
such as one to the childrens game drop the handkerchief 
some of the questions were objectionable and some were out of 
date said james butcher a psychology professor at the 
university of minnesota who helped revise the test my 
conclusions were that it was basically a very sound instrument but 
it could be improved 
about 100 items have been added designed to pinpoint such 
modern problems as type a achievementoriented behavior drug 
abuse and attitudes about mental health treatment researchers 
turned to alcohol treatment centers mental health programs and 
personnel settings to get a read on contemporary issues 
the original test of 556 truefalse statements was questioned by 
critics because it used as a basis for normal personality the 
answers from a sample group of about 700 rural minnesotans 
averaging 35 years old with eighthgrade educations 
butcher last week said the revised sample is four times that 
size and covers various ethnic economic and geographic groups from 
seven regions around the country 
weve tried to make the test more applicable to todays 
problems he said the revision is designed to be more user 
friendly and of similar validity as the original test 
the test was developed at the university of minnesota in the 
1930s and 1940s by psychologist starke r hathaway and psychiatrist 
j charnley mckinley 
they compared a sample group with a group of patients diagnosed 
with problems including paranoia schizophrenia depression and 
obsessivecompulsive tendencies results were intended to reveal 
social and personal maladjustment 
the test is used in more than 100 countries in scores of 
translations butcher said originally used primarily in clinical 
settings it has spread to personnel military and research 
applications 
sample truefalse questions include i do not tire quickly 
i am worried about sex and i believe i am being plotted 
against 
the sevenyear revision was completed by butcher and psychology 
professors auke tellegen also of the university of minnesota john 
r graham of kent state university and w grant dahlstrom of the 
university of north carolina 
the revised test is similar to the original with test subjects 
answering 567 questions on their feelings symptoms attitudes and 
beliefs 
only licensed psychologists are authorized to buy the test 
whose rights are owned by the university of minnesota press 
anybody who can count can score it but it takes expertise to 
interpret it butcher said

the national park service has decided 
against raising the sunken ferry ellis island which carried 12 
million immigrants to new lives 
the park service cant afford the estimated 250000 it would 
cost to raise the 160foot ferry which rests under 14 feet of 
water on ellis island said spokeswoman edie sheanhammond 
the government may eventually try to bring up pieces of the 
85yearold boat which sank at the former immigration station in 
1968 she said 
officials said earlier that they would have to move the wreck 
because it might interfere with boat traffic when a museum opens on 
ellis island next year but they have decided to work around the 
boat ms sheanhammond said 
a navy salvage unit decided in june that the boats iron hull 
was too weak to withstand the stress of being raised 
the ellis island ferried immigrants and government workers 
between the island and the mainland the boat was moored at the 
island after the immigration station closed in 1954

syria reportedly massed its troops and 
armor in mountains overlooking this battered city today during 
renewed shelling duels stirring fears of another ground assault on 
christian areas 
the fighting came a day after the christian forces of gen 
michel aoun repelled a ground attack on souk elgarb a mountain 
stronghold outside beirut it was the first ground assault in five 
months of fierce artillery and rocket exchanges between christian 
forces and syrian troops allied with druse militias 
police reported three people killed and 12 wounded in todays 
renewed shelling exchanges between aouns forces and the syrian 
army 
the new casualties raised the overall death toll since fighting 
broke out march 8 to 736 killed and 1896 wounded by police count 
at least 37 civilians were killed and 120 wounded during shelling 
between midnight saturday and midnight sunday 
police said the hilltop presidential palace where aoun has an 
underground headquarters bunker was repeatedly hit today by syrian 
mortar and rocket fire but a police spokesman said there were no 
casualties and that aoun and his aides were safe 
the spokesman who cannot be identified in keeping with 
regulations said the syrians were massing troops and armor in a 
central mountain near douar 11 miles northeast of souk elgharb 
theyre bringing in t62 tanks and dozens of mortars of 
various calibers to positions overlooking douar he said 
douar is a major christian military position beside the main 
road through the mountains from the syrianheld bekaa valley in 
east lebanon 
todays movements triggered fears the syrians were planning a 
new attempt to punch into the christian enclave 
souk elgharb which lies 15 miles southeast of beirut was 
again hit by syrian shellfire today 
police said 25 syrians 20 druse militiamen and 25 palestinians 
were killed sunday in the souk elgharb fighting and in skirmishes 
along beiruts dividing green line the lebanese army said four of 
its men were killed and six wounded they were no immediate reports 
of casualties today 
aouns aides said his forces were bracing for another assault 
were ready to take them on again an aoun aide said as 
mortar and tank fire hit the town abandoned by civilians six years 
ago 
the mountaintop garrison under siege by syrianbacked moslem 
forces since 1983 controls a network of roads that twist through 
lebanons central range into the christian heartland 
if souk elgharb fell it would leave the way open for a syrian 
ground offensive into the beleaguered christian sector 
aoun said his ustrained 8th brigade reinforced by the 10th 
commando brigade repulsed a fourpronged attack on souk elgharb 
sunday by 2100 syrian regulars palestinian guerrillas of the 
radical syrianbacked fatahuprising faction and the druse 
progressive socialist party militia 
aoun the army commander and leader of a christian cabinet 
controls an estimated 20000 troops opposed by about 40000 syrian 
regulars and their moslem militia allies aoun is also backed by 
the 6000member rightwing lebanese forces the main chrisitan 
militia 
the recent fighting is the latest round in a 14yearold civil 
war 
todays bombardment began sporadically around dawn and 
intensified by midday into sustained barrages on christian east 
beirut and north along the coast aouns artillery retaliated by 
opening up on syrian gun positions in west beirut 
a syrian militiary spokesman in damascus denied that any syrian 
forces were involved in sundays fighting at souk elgharb 
syrias military headquarters in lebanon said in a statement 
that nationalist forces allies to syria mounted the assault 
the druse party claimed its men staged a hitandrun attack 
on the christian base

russian workers in estonia kept up their 6dayold 
strike today and workers at six factories in the southwestern 
republic of azerbaijan reportedly walked out to support demands of 
a new nationalist group 
in a third soviet area threatened by nationalist strikes the 
caucasus mountain republic of georgia activists said they will 
decide at a mass meeting tonight whether to call a walkout for 
tuesday 
in estonias baltic sea capital of tallinn strike leaders said 
today at least 20000 russian workers stayed off the job to protest 
a new law that tightens residency requirements for voters and 
candidates 
the strike is continuing said strike committee member 
alexei kutenyov in a telephone interview he said the committee 
expected decisive action on the stoppage from a kremlin commission 
on interethnic affairs by tuesday but he did not elaborate 
staterun moscow radio said today the estonian strike has caused 
losses of millions of dollars 
it said the estonian law will take the right to vote away from 
more than 100000 nonestonians in the republic of 16 million 
the new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the 
same district for two years or anywhere in estonia for five years 
candidates must live in the same place for five years or in estonia 
for 10 years 
in azerbaijan a local journalist reported workers walked out in 
the late afternoon at six factories including a steel plant in 
the capital of baku 
of bakus estimated 1 million workers only about 1 percent 
joined the stoppage said saveli peretz deputy chief of 
azerinform the official azerbaijani news agency 
speaking by telephone he said the strike call which was put 
forth by the newly formed peoples front of azerbaijan would 
probably be discussed at a mass meeting in baku late today 
the strike was meant to support demands that local leaders 
find political solutions instead of military ones to the 
republics ethnic violence which has caused dozens of deaths said 
activist aidin amirbekov in a telephone interview sunday 
some activists in azerbaijan are also demanding removal of 
soviet troops from the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh and 
an end to curfews in the republic but amirbekov said authorities 
consider relations too tense to take such a step 
troops reportedly have been halting clashes in nagornokarabakh 
on almost a daily basis 
traditionally shiite moslem azerbaijan has been embroiled in a 
dispute with neighboring armenia whose population is mainly 
christian over control of the nagornokarabakh region 
nagornokarabakh is part of azerbaijan but its population is 
predominantly armenian and armenia wants to annex it 
in estonia kutenyov said work had at least partially halted at 
46 of the republics enterprises mainly in tallinn and in the 
mining town of kohtlajarve the labor newspaper trud said sunday 
39 factories were involved in the strike 
estonian journalists said today some of the bus lines in tallinn 
were not running thats the most acute thing for us said 
estonian radio commentator harry tiido in a telephone interview 
cargo railcars were piling up at tallinn stations because train 
workers were on strike and the state airline aeroflot was carrying 
only emergency supplies and passengers there trud said 
the strikers most of whom work in industrial plants also 
object to a new national decision to give estonia free rein over 
its economy the workers are demanding factories with a 
predominantly russianspeaking labor force remain under supervision 
of the national government rather than be handed over to estonia

the west german government closed its 
embassy in budapest today to stop a flood of east germans hoping to 
go west about 100 wouldbe emigrants were locked outside but 181 
occupying the embassy were allowed to remain inside 
the foreign ministry announced sunday the embassy would be 
closed because its ability to assist the stream of east german 
refugees was totally exhausted 
in bonn foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher told 
reporters those inside the embassy were being cared for by the 
diplomatic staff and that red cross volunteers were erecting 
temporary facilities outside the mission for new arrivals 
hungarys foreign minister gyula horn met today with juergen 
suedhoff of the bonn foreign ministry for talks focusing on the 
situation said hungarys official mti news agency 
talks dealt with the possible humanitarian solutions to the 
problem mti reported without elaboration 
many of those at the embassy in budapest are east germans who 
were caught trying to reach the west illegally they are seeking 
west german assistance out of fear they will be punished if they 
return home 
schumacher said 141 adults and 40 children were inside the 
compound he said news reports estimating the number at up to 300 
were exaggerated 
more east germans are thought to be sheltered in buildings 
rented by west germans 
west german embassies in other east bloc capitals also have been 
deluged by east germans hoping to emigrate and fearing punishment 
if they return home despite east german assurances they will not 
be punished 
bonn closed its east berlin mission on tuesday after 131 east 
germans sought refuge there and west german officials have said it 
will not be opened again until normal operations can resume 
about 20 east germans were believed to have sought refuge at the 
west german diplomatic mission in prague czechoslovakia but there 
were no indications the bonn government had any plans to close that 
facility 
the crush in hungary began after that soviet bloc nation began 
dismantling barriers along its western frontier with neutral 
austria 
it is estimated at least 1500 east germans managed to make 
their way to west germay by going first to hungary and then 
crossing through austria 
many were caught by hungarian border guards as they tried to get 
to austria and some took refuge in the west german compound 
west germany as a standard practice grants asylum to east 
germans but west german foreign ministry officials have said that 
only east germany can grant the refugees exit visas applications 
to emigrate often take years to process 
dozens of mostly young east germans spent the night in front of 
the budapest compound despite the announcement the embassy would be 
closed their numbers had swollen to about 100 by midday when the 
doors closed 
west germany expects about 100000 east germans to make their 
way to west germany by the end of the year through legal emigration 
and escapes 
hungarianlanguage radio today reported that 471 east germans 
were caught trying to escape to austria over the weekend from 
hungary 
a hamburgbased newspaper the world on sunday said the west 
german intelligence service has determined that 15 million east 
germans out of the population of 16 million want to emigrate to the 
west 
hungary and poland have followed the soviet union in 
implementing political and economic reforms with greater individual 
freedoms 
but east german leader erich honecker has not wavered from his 
hardline policies

a supreme court justice today temporarily 
freed louisiana officials from having to replace four governing 
boards with one to help racially desegregate the states 17 public 
colleges and universities 
justice byron r white acting on emergency requests from the 
southern university board of supervisors and state attorney general 
william guste postponed the effect of a ruling that the 
fourgoverningboards system is a vestige of segregation that 
must be eliminated 
white was told that the southern university board under a 
threejudge federal courts order would cease to exist by aug 19 
if he did not help 
whites order stays the elimination of the southern board until 
the full supreme court receives a response by justice department 
lawyers to the emergency requests filed by the southern board and 
guste the order did not impose a deadline for that response 
southern is louisianas largest predominantly black college 
with 13000 students attending its three undergraduate campuses and 
law school in baton rouge 
southerns board of supervisors with 13 black members and four 
white members is one of four boards governing higher education in 
the state 
one board governs the louisiana state university system another 
governs the mostly black southern university system and a third 
oversees all others those three boards answer to the state board 
of trustees for higher education 
the present scheme has perpetuated illegal segregation in 
louisianas higher education the threejudge court ruled in a 
case begun in 1974 when justice department officials sued in behalf 
of black students 
the lower courts ruling last month would create a single 
governing board restrict admissions as some universities limit 
degree programs most can offer and establish a community college 
system 
the threejudge court ordered designation of lsu as the unified 
systems flagship school with the greatest number of graduate and 
research programs and the strictist admissions requirements 
it also called for creation of an intermediate level of four 
institutions including southern to offer significant doctoral and 
other graduate programs and for gradually merging the lsu and 
southern law schools 
eight other schools including the predominantly black grambling 
state university would be designated as a third tier and limited 
to offering undergraduate degrees 
four colleges would become part of the new community college 
system 
state sen william jefferson a black new orleans lawyer who 
filed the emergency request on behalf of the southern board said 
last month that the merger of the southern and lsu law schools is 
a real big problem for the board and for the black community 
more than 90 percent of louisianas black lawyers are graduates 
of the southern university law school 
gustes emergency request to white contended that any current 
racial segregation among louisianas colleges and universities is 
the result of student preferences and not any action or inaction by 
state officials 
past constitutional infirmities of 20 years ago that have long 
since been ameliorated does not justify judicial usurpation of the 
inherently sensitive realm of higher educational policy guste 
argued 
the cases are southern u vs us a126 and guste vs us 
a127

bad weather today forced rescue 
teams to postpone efforts to recover the bodies of rep mickey 
leland and 15 others who died when their plane slammed into a 
remote southwestern mountain 
heavy clouds and rain twice forced two blackhawk helicopters 
with us and ethiopian personnel to return to the capital before 
the weather cleared enough for them to make the 250mile flight to 
the crash site by midafternoon 
however it was too late to begin fullscale recovery operations 
by then said james haley chief spokesman for the us embassy 
weve got people down there and have started taking the 
necessary photographs said haley but we wont begin 
retrieving bodies until tomorrow 
the bodies of 12 victims including the texas democrat were 
found sunday in the wreckage of the twinengine plane which 
disappeared aug 7 on a flight to a refugee camp near the sudanese 
border 
three others who had been on board were presumed dead in the 
crash that one us air force pilot described as awesome 
unsurvivable workers were searching for the missing bodies in a 
ravine below a jagged cliff at the crash site westsouthwest of the 
capital 
the nose of the plane just ran into rocks said rep gary 
ackerman dny who was in the helicopter that first spotted the 
wreckage of his colleague who was chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger 
the wings sheared off and the engine and fuselage were 
burned ackerman said after returning to washington late sunday 
the cause of the crash was not known but the weather was cloudy 
and visibility was poor when leland and his party left addis ababa 
bad weather had delayed their takeoff by two hours 
flags were lowered to halfstaff at the white house while 
president bush and other leaders expressed sorrow at the death of 
leland who was en route to inspect conditions of 300000 sudanese 
civil war refugees at a camp in fugnido about 100 miles southwest 
of the crash site 
the twin otter aircraft owned by ethiopias relief agency 
crashed 4300 feet up the side of the 5500foot mountain 
the bodies were to be flown to nearby dembidola and then ferried 
by a c130 cargo plane to the capital 
haley said the two blackhawk helicopters would stay overnight at 
gambela about 34 miles southeast of the crash site and begin 
salvaging efforts at daybreak they were expected to be joined by 
two more blackhawk helicopters carrying additional rescue crews in 
the morning 
about 100 recovery personnel were sent to the site today 
two c130s carrying helicopter fuel also will leave for the site 
at first light said haley 
the bodies of the americans were expected to be flown back to 
the united states later this week aboard a c141 hospital plane 
according to an administration official in washington 
pentagon spokesman navy capt stan bloyer said in washingon that 
lelands plane did not appear to be attempting an emergency landing 
when it crashed he said it basically disintegrated after 
hitting the side of the mountain apparently at cruise speed 
the wreckage was in terrain so rugged that medical teams 
including two doctors had to be initially lowered to the site from 
helicopters said haley 
the bodies of the nine americans were to be flown home via 
torrejon air base outside madrid spain seven ethiopians were also 
on board 
lelands party consisted of two staff members an aide to rep 
ronald v dellums dcalif a friend of the congressman three 
officers of the us agency for international development and the 
wife of one aid official the ethiopians included a us embassy 
employee three government officials and a crew of three 
mourned as a fighter for the homeless and hungry worldwide 
leland was a sixterm representative from houston who began his 
political career as a firebrand militant but won the respect of 
both liberals and conservatives 
bush said in a statement from the white house mickey leland 
and the other members of his traveling party both americans and 
ethiopians were engaged in a noble cause trying to feed the 
hungry 
leland often said his commitment to ending hunger was rooted in 
a trip he made to sudan in 1984 when a starving young girl died 
before his eyes at a refugee camp every day i see her face he 
told reporters 
the trip that ended with his death was his second there since 
march he visited ethiopia and sudan six times in the 10 years he 
served in congress he was elected to fill the seat vacated by 
barbara jordan when she retired 
in houston friends and colleagues of leland streamed into his 
office as news spread the wreckage had been discovered 
rep mike andrews a houston democrat said in a breaking voice 
this is a very difficult time for houston we have lost one of 
our most important leaders and ive lost a very good friend 
texas gov bill clements must decide whether to call a special 
election in november or sooner to fill the downtown houston 
district seat leland held

turner broadcasting system inc got a jump on 
the school year today with the launch of its commercialfree news 
show for use in the classroom 
the producers of the program cnn newsroom which made its debut 
today say they want to give principals and teachers a chance to 
review the daily news program and decide if it fits their class 
plans 
theres another reason for getting an early start it gives ted 
turners cable news network a jump on the advertisersupported 
channel one news service that whittle communications plans to offer 
starting in march 
school might not start until the first of september but 
teachers are already planning the fall semester said paul amos 
an executive vice president at cnn if they like it they can put 
the program on beginning day one of the school year for students 
cnn plans to carry the 15minute shows without commercials at 
345 am edt each weekday so that teachers may tape them and 
replay all or parts of them in the classroom later in the day 
the first show featured the days headlines including a report 
on rep mickey leland the texas democrat killed in a plane crash 
in ethiopia and feature stories on a georgia high school teacher 
who publishes a folklore magazine chinas new student 
indoctrination program and a weekend rock concert in moscow 
along with the news shows turner is making a teachers guide 
available via computer mail to suggest ways the program can be used 
to inspire discussions or research 
the channel one service which runs 12 minutes a day with two 
minutes of commercials was tested for seven weeks last spring in 
six middle and high schools while the shows were generally 
wellreceived by teachers and students in the test several 
national educational groups protested vehemently against giving 
advertisers a vehicle for pitching products in the classroom 
officials in new york and california have banned channel one 
from their schools because of the commercials 
turner had planned to include public servicetype commercials on 
cnn newsroom but decided to exclude advertising altogether and pick 
up the sevenfigure tab himself after hearing some eleventhhour 
complaints from educators 
channel one is planning to make massive donations to schools of 
television monitors satellite dishes and videocassette recorders 
along with programming 
it hopes to have 1000 schools hooked up by launch date in march 
and 8000 by the fall of 1990 
turner is not donating tv monitors or recorders but has 
encouraged the cable systems that carry the program to provide free 
hookups to schools and donations of vcrs or television sets where 
needed 
cnns amos said he expects 1000 schools will make use of the 
cnn newsroom program when schools open this fall 
two other cable networks also are planning special programs for 
the classroom neither will carry ads 
cspan the cable network that carries congressional sessions 
plans to run a studentoriented 10minute program on a single 
subject every week starting aug 22 
the discovery channel will offer a daily onehour show for the 
classroom starting sept 18 with programming in areas such as

del este arrested two men after the fugitives plane 
landed at hernandario airport about 20 miles from the border the men

the drama began aug 3 when 9yearold said agel filho was abducted 
in front of his home in the central brazilian city of 
goiania 850 miles northwest of rio 
six days later police traced a phone call from the kidnappers to the 
boys family and surrounded a house on the citys

to exchange places with the boy and the kidnappers accepted

airport but authorities there refused to give them a 
plane and pilot the kidnappers then set off on a 500mile trip through 
the states of goias minas gerais and sao paulo

turn back as darkness made it impossible to land on the 
narrow highway where the kidnappers car was parked

the united states after it is retrieved 
from the wreckage of a plane crash in ethiopia while president bush says 
he is truly saddened by this tragic accident 
the president said sunday the texas democrat and his 15 companions 
were engaged in a noble cause trying to feed the hungry 
when their plane crashed after taking off from addis ababa for a refugee 
camp near the sudan border 
after learning that the plane was found sunday on a remote ethiopian 
mountain 100 miles from its destination bush asked two 
white house officials to accompany a congressional team that will bring 
the bodies of leland and eight other americans back to the 
united states 
an administration official said a decision on when the delegation would 
leave washington would hinge on the identification of the 
bodies 
flags were quickly lowered to half staff at the white house and elsewhere 
in official washington on sunday and national leaders 
expressed sorrow at the loss of the congressman and others on the plane 
i want to simply express the profound sadness that we feel at 
the loss of the lives in ethiopia the president said

humor

hear that the discovery of mickey lelands aircraft revealed 
that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic accident 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir in a telegram today to lelands 
family called him one of the champions of human rights 
a great friend of israel and an enthusiastic supporter of the issue of 
ethiopian jewry

of its most dedicated committed and energetic members 
in his search to look at into the plight of the worlds most desperate 
and hungry individuals rep leland represented the best 
in compassion that we as a nation possess foley said his was a mission 
which as we all know all too well now was fraught 
with potential danger 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine extended his sympathies 
to relatives and friends of leland and the other 
victims leland had a special devotion to the less fortunate and particularly 
to those who suffer from the tragedy of hunger he 
said 
rep jack fields a texas republican asked to make the trip by house 
minority leader bob michel said the remoteness of the area 
and the weather would affect how quickly the bodies can be brought out 
of the mountain ravine where scattered pieces of the plane 
were found 
the pentagon said us air force searchers confirmed there were no 
survivors at the crash site navy capt stan bloyer said the 
plane basically disintegrated when it slammed into a mountainside and 
caught fire 
michel also designated rep bill emerson ranking republican on the 
house select committee on hunger to make the trip while 
house speaker thomas s foley authorized majority whip william h gray 
iii dpa and rep ronald v dellums dcalif chairman of 
the congressional black caucus to travel to addis ababa 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said frederick c mcclure bushs 
chief liaison to congress and a deputy nicholas calio 
would join the congressional delegation 
leland chairman of the house select committee on hunger was making 
his second trip to the horn of africa since march to promote 
relief efforts for hundreds of thousands of starving sudanese 
gray said the plane crash deprives us all of a man whose compassion 
commitment and leadership in the war against hunger saved 
the lives of tens of thousands of the worlds children those of us who 
are his colleagues and friends can best keep his spirit 
alive by renewing our commitment to the cause for which he gave his life

twenty years after it rocked the nation the woodstock festival reverberates 
in americas consciousness a 
national poll has found but people say woodstocks hallmark rock n 
roll music has lost its tune 
most americans have heard of the threeday counterculture concert 
three in 10 of them wish theyd been there and nearly six in 
10 say it has had a lasting effect on society the media generalassociated 
press poll found 
but the view of woodstock was not idealized only half those who saw 
a lasting impact said it was a positive one and just a 
quarter of the 1163 respondents said the woodstock era was a better time 
than today 
featuring many of the top rock n roll bands of the day woodstock 
drew half a million people to a muddy farm in upstate new 
york from aug 1517 1969 the term woodstock nation soon came to 
describe young people demanding an end to the vietnam war and 
the loosening of social mores 
of the eight in 10 respondents who had heard of woodstock 70 percent 
said they regarded it more as the expression of a social 
movement than simply a music festival and half of them said that social 
movement continues today 
woodstockera rock n roll did well in the test of time rock music 
of the woodstock days was rated twice as highly as todays 
rock n roll and nearly half of all respondents said they still listen 
to woodstock rock 
the poll conducted by telephone among a random sample of respondents 
july 716 had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points 
it found a distinct generational split in views of woodstock forty 
percent of the respondents younger than 45 would have liked 
to have attended for example compared with just 10 percent of the older 
respondents 
moreover among people who said the festival had a lasting social impact 
more than 60 percent of the younger group said it was a 
positive effect while only about a quarter of older respondents agreed 
interest in rock music followed similar lines more than 60 percent 
of those under 45 said they listen to woodstockera rock n 
roll now evidence of the sizable audience for classic rock radio programming 
of those 45 and older just 22 percent were tuned 
in to woodstock rock 
overall half rated rock music of the late 1960s and early 1970s as 
excellent or good while just 27 percent gave favorable 
ratings to todays rock n roll among respondents under 45 seven in 
10 gave high ratings to woodstock rock while only four in 10 
approved of newer rock 
twenty percent of the respondents said they knew someone who attended 
the woodstock festival and 2 percent or 25 of the 1163

an estimated 17 americans are accidentally electrocuted by hair dryers 
each year the consumer product safety 
commission said monday in announcing a voluntary recall of some 250000 
dryers by four firms 
officials of the commission said more than half of the victims are 
children playing with hair dryers in the bathtub 
david schmeltzer associate executive director for compliance and administrative 
litigation said the hair dryers being withdrawn 
failed to meet a voluntary standard adopted in 1987 requiring hair dryers 
to have a cutoff device to prevent fatal leakage of 
current when a dryer enters the water with the switch in the off position 
the staff is contacting other firms seeking additional recalls 
he said 
schmeltzer estimated there are about 80 million hair dryers still in 
the hands of consumers that do not employ the new immersion 
protection technology 
most consumers have the erroneous idea that when a hair dryer is 
turned off it does not create an electrocution hazard he 
said this is simply not the case 
schmeltzer holding a hair dryer in his hand said you dont have 
to stretch your imagination to realize that a young child 
particularly a boy can simulate or think that it appears like a gun 
it makes noises its like a ray gun its something that would come 
out of star wars star trek or even indiana jones 
he said 
schmeltzer said children also turn the hair dryers on and use them 
to propel sailboats rubber ducks and other floating toys 
girls he said sometimes use them to dry their dolls hair 
bill walton head of engineering sciences for the commission described 
what he said is a typical scenario 
the hair dryer is plugged in and the parent or grandparent leaves 
the room for a few seconds perhaps to answer the telephone 
perhaps to dry and dress another child or perhaps to get clothing the 
child reaches up takes the hair dryer and either on 
purpose or accidentally inserts the hair dryer into the water we have 
a sudden death the childs heart has stopped there have 
been no splashes no screams no noises at all the parent comes back and 
finds the child or children dead 
while any childs death is tragic these electrocutions are particularly 
devastating because they are all preventable said 
anne graham acting chairman of the commission 
she said the firms that have agreed to recall hair dryers and the 
dryers involved are mbr industries miami pomair pro 2100 
and 1900 mustang electronics hallandale fla mustang mu 2100 major 
international inc orange calif major styling dryer model 
1250 and china bazaar san francisco minimate hair dryer and iron ds601 
the commission said the minimate dryers had been stopped in inventory 
before being sold to consumers people who have bought one 
of the others can take them back to the store and get a refund or replacement 
the commission said 
in addition to seeking corrective action from importers of hair dryers 
virtually all of which are manufactured abroad the 
commission is urging householders to have ground fault circuit interrupters 
installed in bathrooms these are devices which 
interrupt the flow of electricity if a dryer or other device is immersed 
in water 
at the very least these hair dryers should never be left plugged 
in especially in homes with children schmeltzer said

the state of connecticut has settled a 
federal lawsuit by agreeing to stop segregating inmates suffering 
from aids 
this consent decree reflects our new knowledge and 
understanding of aids clarine nardi riddle acting connecticut 
attorney general said today 
judy greenspan of the american civil liberties unions national 
prison project in washington praised the settlement as a landmark 
attorneys said the settlement could affect similar lawsuits pending 
in california and alabama 
by not segregating those with fullblown aids connecticut will 
set an example for the rest of the country greenspan said 
william flower a spokesman for the state prison system said the 
state stopped housing aids patients separately about six months ago 
in response to the suit 
before that inmates with aids symptoms were confined to an aids 
ward for up to 23 hours a day at the maximumsecurity prison in 
somers they were not allowed to take part in education recreation 
and religious programs 
under the settlement there no longer will be a separate aids 
ward said deborah chang an attorney for the inmates 
inmates attorneys had charged that inmates put in the aids ward 
with serious aidsrelated symptoms were kept there even after 
showing improvement 
the result was that a lot of people in the prison population 
who were hivinfected refused to go for treatment said chang 
five aidsinfected inmates had brought the classaction lawsuit 
against the state in 1988 three of the inmates have since died 
flower said there is no reliable estimate of the number of 
inmates infected with the aids virus at last count five were being 
treated for aidsrelated illnesses in the systems acute care unit 
he said 
but there is no mandatory testing for the virus and some 
officials have estimated that as many as 25 percent of the prison 
systems 8800 inmates carry the virus

the federal governments sixyear war on drugs 
has made significant inroads in crippling and dismantling major drug 
trafficking organizations us attorney general richard thornburgh 
said monday 
thornburghs comments were in stark opposition to those of sen 
joseph biden ddel who set out a ninepoint drug program during 
an emotional address here sunday before the same congress of 
correctional officers 
thornburgh said that since the drug enforcement task forces were 
created in 1983 prosecutors have announced nearly 5000 indictments 
naming nearly 17000 defendants 
the striking results reflected in this annual report not only 
underscore the effectiveness of this effort but provide notice to 
criminal organizations dealing in drugs that our resolve to destroy 
them is unwavering thornburgh told the 119th congress of the 
american correctional association 
biden told the corrections professionals that us politicans 
talk about waging a war against drug abuse but havent shown the 
courage of matching their rhetoric with the money to pay for 
education and treatment 
he warned that unless the war on drugs gets serious the nation 
faces disaster 
its now time for politicans myself included to stop talking 
and start paying for what we say america needs to fight the drug 
epidemic said biden chairman of the senate judiciary committee 
he blamed the lack of action on read my lips politics a 
pointed reference to president bushs promise not to raise taxes 
biden said congress should instead read the lips of the american 
people when they say give us back our neighborhoods 
one thing is for sure we have to get serious biden said 
we have no war on drugs we need a dday we dont need another 
vietnam 
biden outlined a program that emphasized drug treatment 
especially in prisons research into cures for addiction and 
education he complained the nation was missing an opportunity to 
break the drugcrime cycle because of the lack of drug treatment 
programs in prisons 
the drug problem is expected to be a major topic of discussion 
throughout the fiveday corrections conference

scientists today reported that an 
experimental vaccine protected monkeys from the aids virus but they 
warned that the approach is unlikely to work in humans 
scientists from the new england regional primate research center 
gave inactivated virus to six macaque monkeys two remained free of 
infection when challenged with live virus the others contracted the 
virus but did not get sick 
the researchers said theirs is the first published report 
describing successful vaccine protection against infection by the 
aids virus 
at the very least this vaccine seems to delay or prevent the 
onset of disease symptoms said dr ronald c desrosiers who 
headed the team in some cases it seems to have even prevented 
infection 
their report was published in todays issue of the proceedings of 
the national academy of sciences 
the scientists cautioned that the experiment was conducted under 
carefully controlled laboratory conditions the monkeys were 
monitored extremely closely and challenged with virus when their 
immune response from vaccination was the strongest 
desrosiers said that a human vaccine would have to elicit a more 
powerful and sustained immune response 
while we believe that this demonstrates that it is possible to 
achieve some protection a similar vaccine with the human virus is 
not likely to be useful in humans he said 
the work was first presented in june at an aids meeting in 
montreal at the meeting researchers from the the university of 
california davis reported trying a similar approach in monkeys 
but their attempt failed to protect the animals from infection 
both experiments used vaccine made from inactivated simian 
immunodeficiency virus or siv this virus is a close relative of 
hiv the virus the causes aids in people

some 270000 american adults are suffering a 
serious stress reaction from the killing of a family member a new 
study estimates 
and about 1 million have suffered such a homiciderelated case of 
posttraumatic stress disorder at some point in their lives the 
study says 
it also estimated that 5 million americans older than 18 have 
lost an immediate family member to homicide and an additional 114 
million have lost other relatives or close friends 
the sudden violent death of a family member brings with it 
serious psychological consequences for many family survivors said 
angelynne amick a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at 
the medical university of south carolina 
she discussed the work sunday at the annual meeting of the 
american psychological association the study defined homicide as 
being killed by a criminal or a drunk driver 
posttraumatic stress disorder includes such symptoms as 
persistent and intrusive reliving of the trauma and a general 
numbing of responsiveness 
the study involved a national survey of about 12000 people and 
detailed interviews with a nationally representative sample of 214 
of them amick said 
two other studies of people affected by crimes against others 
focused on the impact of rape 
one work found that those emotionally close to a rape victim the 
people to whom she turns for support often share the social 
stereotypes of rape as at least in part the womans fault said 
researcher ellen brickman 
preliminary results from a study of 75 people close to victims of 
rape or assault found that rape victims were more often blamed for 
the incident than assault victims were she said 
when blame is communicated it does not seem to affect the amount 
of emotional or practical support from the people doing the blaming 
said brickman of the victim services agency in new york 
this complex mix of reactions must be studied further brickman 
said the reactions can have a profound impact on what the people 
closest to the victim communicate to her and how the victim 
endures the aftermath of violent crime she said 
another study suggests that nonsupportive behaviors of other 
people have a stronger impact on a rape victims recovery than 
supportive behaviors do 
nonsupportive behaviors include refusing to discuss the 
incident telling the victim to forget about it blaming her for it 
and asking the victim for emotional support for ones own problems 
said researcher robert davis 
supportive behaviors include such things as practical help with 
daily activities said davis of the new york victim services agency

president bush saying farmers have indeed 
suffered today signed legislation providing nearly 900 million 
in disaster relief for farms where crops were battered this year by 
rain drought and other foul weather 
in remarks at a signing ceremony bush said the disaster 
assistance act of 1989 brings important relief to farm families 
hit by the extreme weather 
the farmer is at the mercy of the forces of nature and 
sometimes nature fails him said the president who persuaded 
congress to trim the relief package to 897 million from an earlier 
13 billion version passed by the house 
this act will help farmers recover after damaging rain and wind 
and will see others through a year when theyve had to stand by and 
watch their crops fail bush said 
in a number of states from the dakotas to the texas panhandle 
and in the midatlantic states as well farmers have indeed 
suffered and this bill provides relief he said he also noted 
that the winter wheat levels in kansas were less than half normal 
levels 
the prevailing climate here in washington is one of fiscal 
restraint and moneys tight and thats why it is good news that the 
cost of the disaster relief is reasonable the president said 
it will provide relief only to those farmers hardest hit by 
adverse weather and it wisely rewards those who took the prudent 
step of purchasing crop insurance he said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said later that 400 
million of the new relief will go to wheat producers in his and 
other states who were hit the hardest 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said we would much have 
preferred to have a much more limited piece of legislation and it 
may work out as a matter of fact to be much limited in its 
administration 
farmers who participated in this years price support program and 
purchased crop insurance will be paid at 65 percent of the target 
price for any losses beyond 35 percent of normal production 
those who were in the program but didnt buy crop insurance will 
be compensated for losses beyond 40 percent of their normal 
production those who were not in the program are eligible only if 
their losses exceed 50 percent white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
bush said he was also pleased that this law loosens some of the 
controls that limit what farmers can plant leaving more farmers 
free then to choose the crops they grow and to diversify 
agricultural production 
the president also was dispatching two aides with a congressional 
delegation bound for addis ababa ethiopia to bring back the 
remains of rep mickey leland dtexas and other americans killed 
in the crash of their mercy flight to a refugee camp it was not 
certain when the delegation would depart 
frederick mcclure the white houses top lobbyist and a deputy 
nicholas calio will join four members of congress on the mission 
bush was informed at camp david on sunday that the wreckage had 
been discovered on a remote hillside after an intense search bush 
said in a statement that leland and the others had died in a noble 
cause trying to feed the hungry 
later after returning to the white house bush told reporters of 
the profound sadness that we feel at the loss of the lives in 
ethiopia 
he said he had not yet spoken with the texas congressmans widow 
alison but i certainly express my profound sadness profound 
regrets over all of this to her and to their child 
he called the houston congressman an outstanding man a man of 
great humor everyone from texas knew of his lively nature and his 
commitment to helping others 
with a smile bush recalled that both the lelands had been his

threefourths of all teenagers and nearly half 
of all adults are ready to volunteer time to drug prevention 
programs education and treatment and 9 in 10 americans want tougher 
antidrug laws a new gallup poll showed today 
the american people are in a wartime mode said george gallup 
in a white house news conference 
william bennett the national drug control director who will make 
the bush administrations policy public early next month said the 
american people have given a very clear sense of direction to us 
in the poll 
the public is ready to take action on all fronts he said 
the survey showed that drug abuse was listed by 32 percent of 
teenagers as the most important problem facing the country ahead 
of fear of war 14 percent economic issues 13 percent 
environment and pollution 7 percent aids 5 percent crime 3 
percent and abortion 2 percent 
bennett said he didnt want to disclose the administrations new 
policy prematurely but said if there is a subtitle to our 
strategy it is everybody plays everybody must do something 
gallup interviewed 1005 adults and 500 teenagers in june and 
july in what he said was the first project of the newly formed 
gallup international foundation 
a record number of americans cite the drug crisis as the 
nations top problem replacing the guns and butter issues of 
international tensions and economic worries he said in the 50 
years that the us public has been asked to name the most important 
problem facing the nation it is virtually unprecedented for any 
social issue to appear at the top of the list 
he said 75 percent of teens and 48 percent of adults said they 
would be willing to work in drug programs and while there is a gap 
between what people say and what they will do it is clear there 
are enormous numbers of americans waiting to be mobilized in the war 
on drugs 
the margin of error was given as four percentage points for the 
adults questioned and six percentage points for the smaller group of 
teens surveyed

health secretary louis sullivan on monday said 
the success of new treatments should encourage more people to be 
tested for aids though he offered no assurance these therapies 
would be available to those who cannot afford them 
sullivan also said the government and local communities must do a 
better job targeting aids prevention messages to minorities and he 
said people with aids must not be treated as political footballs 
speaking at the opening session of a national conference on aids 
among racial and ethnic populations the secretary noted that the 
disease is taking a disproportionate toll on the minority community 
blacks who comprise 12 of the us population represent 26 
percent of adult aids cases in the united states and 53 percent of 
pediatric cases he said hispanics who make up 7 percent of the 
nations population represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23 
percent of pediatric cases 
we must increasingly develop accurate and credible information 
campaigns that will successfully reach and motivate americans who 
have been missed by our previous efforts sullivan said that 
means we must develop culturally relevant and sensitive materials 
that can be carefully targeted to an identified group 
however he added community standards must be respected in 
messages designed to educate about the disease that is often 
transmitted through sexual contact 
homosexual and bisexual men comprise 62 percent of the nations 
aids cases though intravenous drug users who now represent 20 
percent of the cases are the fastest growing segment of people with 
the disease 
sullivan said the epidemic must remain focused on public health 
with no judgments about morality 
people with aids must not be treated as bargaining chips or 
political footballs they must be given our compassion our respect 
and our best efforts he said 
he added we must end the specter of discrimination 
as of july 30 the total number of americans diagnosed with aids 
reached 102621 of whom 59391 have died since july 1 1981 
according to the centers for disease control 
between 1 million and 15 million americans are believed to be 
infected with the virus though many of them do not know it because 
they have never been tested sullivan said 
with new therapies being approved to treat the disease in its 
early states and prolong survival more people should be pursuaded 
to get tested he said 
asked in a brief session with reporters after his address how the 
government plans to make these therapies available to those who test 
positive but cannot pay for the treatments he offered little 
assurance 
the federal role is not the sole responsibility for addressing 
this problem he said certainly state governments and local 
governments as well as private insurance also have a role to play 
the picture is one were constantly evaluating and if we find 
were falling short within an area we know we can do better were 
going to be seeking those additional funds he said 
he said president bushs proposed fiscal 1990 budget did not 
include any money for early intervention treatments because when the 
spending plan was drafted the therapies now proving successful were 
not known to be effective he said he was looking to congress to 
address that

a un team working on a cambodian peace 
plan arrived monday to visit guerrilla bases on the thai side of the 
border 
the 15member group mostly military specialists spent a week in 
cambodia to determine what would be needed to form an international 
body to monitor a vietnamese troop pullout and a truce 
the team inspected the countrys transport and communications 
and visited the vietnamese border 
we were able to see as much as we could in the days we were in 
cambodia the teams leader lt gen martin o vadset of norway 
said in bangkok it is difficult to cover every square meter of 
any country and the infrastructure in cambodia implies that you 
cannot move as fast as you could even if you use helicopters 
vadset said his team plans to meet with foreign minister siddi 
savetsila of thailand and representatives of the three cambodian 
guerrilla factions 
maj gen amporn chuataputhi thai liaison officer for the un 
team said the team would start tuesday by visiting a northern base 
controlled by forces of the joint resistance leader prince sihanouk 
the group plans to travel to a camp of the khmer peoples 
national liberation front on wednesday and an area controlled by the 
khmer rouge on thursday 
the communist khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people 
when it ruled cambodia for nearly four years vietnam invaded in 
late 1978 driving out the khmer rouge and installing another 
communist government 
jamshid anvar the un teams political adviser said the visit 
to the resistances military bases would be the first official one 
by the united nations 
the vietnamese pullout of 26000 troops from cambodia announced 
for late september will leave the vietnameseinstalled government 
in phnom penh fighting the guerrilla coalition unless international 
peace talks in paris take a dramatic turnaround 
nations at the talks sent the un team to the region to help in 
their efforts to prepare a settlement the team plans to leave for 
paris on sunday and report back to the conference 
one team member who spoke on condition of anonymity said it may 
require 120 personnel to monitor the pullout and about 6000 to form 
a peacekeeping force the effort would cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars and probably could not be organized outside un auspices 
he said 
the prime minister of the provietnamese government hun sen has 
opposed a peacekeeping force and a un role in the peace process

oils down real estates reeling and banks 
are in the red but politicians arent letting that crimp their 
bigspending style in the race to replace multimillionaire oilman 
bill clements as governor 
political analysts are predicting a bigspending freeforall 
next year in the first race in more than 20 years in which an 
incumbent texas governor isnt seeking reelection 
democratic attorney general jim mattox who has collected more 
than 4 million for his expected campaign disagreed with a recent 
newspaper report that suggested gubernatorial spending could hit 50 
million 
i think thats way too low he said 
gop candidate jack rains a former texas secretary of state and 
founder of the 3d international engineering and design firm put it 
another way 
i am prepared to stand toetotoe and wad up dollar bills and 
start throwing them rains said theyre going to run out of 
money before all of my friends and i do 
besides mattox and rains the lineup of people planning or 
considering bids for clements office includes a rising national 
democratic star a pair of comeback minded exgovernors a 
millionaire oilman and rancher a democratturnedrepublican and 
corporate raider t boone pickens 
but it doesnt include president bushs eldest son george w 
bush of dallas coowner of the texas rangers baseball team 
although many republicans said he would be the frontrunner bush 
bowed out aug 1 saying the only race he cares about is for the 
american league pennant 
clements the states only republican governor this century had 
announced shortly after winning his second term that he didnt 
intend to seek a third hell be 73 when the term expires in january 
1991 the last incumbent to voluntarily step down was john connally 
in 1968 
in the wake of republican inroads in texas democratic national 
chairman ron brown recently said the state is crucial to party hopes 
for the 1990s he noted that no democrat has been elected president 
this century without carrying texas and added we have got to 
recapture the statehouse here 
but thats a costly proposition in a state that spans two time 
zones and has more than 20 television markets the 1986 race for 
example saw combined spending by clements and thengov mark white 
of about 25 million though both had little opposition 
while the primary isnt until march 1990 candidates in both 
parties have been jockeying for months only three have formally 
declared but a fourth is ready to do so tuesday and others are 
raising money or admit to considering a race 
state treasurer ann richards is the only announced democratic 
candidate she became an instant celebrity after her 1988 democratic 
national convention keynote speech accusing president bush of being 
born with a silver foot in his mouth she has banked more than 
1 million and favors abortion rights and more action to help the 
environment 
three other democrats are considering a run 
mattox except for his first try for party precinct chairman 
he has never lost a race for public office the former congressman 
compiled an activist record on consumer fraud nursing home abuse 
and environmental issues 
white he ousted clements in 1982 only to be ousted in return 
in 1986 now a lawyer in houston white says hell decide by fall 
whether to try a clementsstyle comeback 
dolph briscoe who was elected governor in 1972 and lost the 
democratic primary in 1978 the 65yearold multimillionaire rancher 
and banker says there is a vacuum of conservative leadership in the 
party 
there are two announced republican candidates and a third set to 
make his formal announcement this week 
clayton williams oilman rancher telephone company founder 
who pledged to spend 3 million of his own to win the republican 
nomination but his start was a little rocky when news reports noted 
that williams contributed to two democratic potential rivals mattox 
and ms richards last year 
rains he was campaign strategist for clements who appointed 
him secretary of state the states top political patronage job in 
1987 he quit the post when he launched his gubernatorial bid 
kent hance who is planning his formal announcement tuesday a 
onetime democratic congressman from lubbock he lost the 1984 
democratic nomination for senate then changed parties his 1986 bid 
for governor failed but he has since become a member of the 
powerful railroad commission which regulates oil and gas production

prime minister czeslaw kiszczak said today 
he will give up his bid to form a new government and resign so the 
leader of the small united peasant party can take over and form a 
coalition government 
his announcement broadcast by the staterun pap news agency 
came as solidarity tried to persuade the peasants aligned with the 
communists in parliament to join in a noncommunist coalition 
at the moment a situation has been created in which i can see 
a chance to form a new government by peasant leader roman 
malinowski in which there would be representatives of all forces 
represented at the parliament kiszczak said in a statement issued 
by pap 
kiszczak was elected prime minister aug 2 winning a majority in 
parliament despite objections from the solidarity caucus which 
holds 35 percent of parliaments seats 
solidaritys parliament leader bronislaw geremek refused 
comment on kiszczaks announcement solidarity leader lech walesa 
was not at home and could not be reached for comment 
walesa said last week that solidarity could not support a 
government formed by kiszczak and he invited the peasant party and 
the democratic party also aligned with the communists to join in a 
coalition that would give poland its first noncommunist government 
since world war ii 
earlier today walesa tried to arrange talks with malinowski and 
jerzy jozwiak the leader of the democratic party but the two 
leaders apparently declined to meet with him 
kiszczak said walesas proposal complicates and prolongs the 
process of trying to form a government 
but he said the proposal also indicated walesas negative 
attitude toward a coalition government had eased creating a chance 
for a grand coalition in which the opposition would be offered 
several ministries 
kiszczak said he viewed malinowski as having the best chance of 
forming such a coalition 
solidarity has rejected the grand coalition idea saying the 
new government must have public support to rule and that a 
communistled coalition would not have such support 
kiszczak said he would contact president wojciech jaruzelski so 
that he considers the new situation and draws from it the proper 
conclusions 
the speaker of the parliament mikolaj kozakiewicz said 
jaruzelski must accept kiszczaks resignation he said the 
parliament would then have to vote on malinowski if he were formally 
nominated 
however aleksander bentkowski the peasant party parliamentary 
caucus leader said in a telephone interview he was not sure 
malinowski would accept the nomination because of the slim chances 
of successfully forming a coalition 
malinowski 54 has led the peasant party since 1981 but he was 
among the prominent communist coalition candidates who failed to win 
election in june 
in the june 4 elections solidaritybacked candidates won all 161 
seats open to them in the 460member sejm or parliament and 99 of 
100 seats in the newly created senate 
the communists control 37 percent of the parliament and 
solidarity has 35 percent the peasant party and democratic party 
hold the balance of parliamentary power 
earlier today solidarity senator jaroslaw kaczynski read a brief 
statement from walesa in which he said his offer of a coalition with 
the peasants and democrats stood 
kaczynski confirmed sunday that walesa himself was considering 
being prime minister in a solidarityled coalition government 
kaczynski began talks with the two minor parties thursday and 
they continued through the weekend at an undisclosed site he said

the pilots seat on 
columbia jerked backward about one inch when the space shuttle was 
launched last week but the malfunction caused no problems a nasa 
official said today 
it was exciting when it happened but shuttle pilot richard 
richards used a motor control to move the seat forward to its normal 
position and it stayed said ann montgomery in charge of 
processing columbia after its fiveday military mission 
the shuttles commander and pilot actually do very little during 
liftoff which is almost entirely controlled by computers 
a leaky inflight steering thruster will need replacing but 
columbias crew shut it down during the flight and used other 
thrusters montgomery said 
only three of the shuttles roughly 30000 heatshielding tiles 
were damaged enough to require replacement based on initial 
inspection she said two of the tiles may have been damaged when 
yetunidentified debris fell from the shuttle when it was launched 
tuesday from florida she added 
overall columbia looks absolutely beautiful montgomery 
said adding that workers will examine about 20 other minor 
potential problems that developed just before or during columbias 
flight 
the shuttle landed at this mojave desert military base sunday 
morning after its fiveday onehour mission to deploy a satellite 
which experts have said is a modified kh12 spy satellite designed 
to photograph military targets the astronauts also reportedly 
performed experiments related to the star wars antimissile 
defense system 
columbia probably will leave saturday for a piggyback flight back 
to cape canaveral fla atop a modified boeing 747 jetliner 
montgomery said 
columbias mission restored the shuttle fleet to three orbiters 
columbia is the oldest shuttle it last flew in january 1986 
landing 10 days before challenger exploded during liftoff killing 
seven crew members after the accident nasa concentrated on making 
safety modifications to the two newer shuttles discovery and 
atlantis before refurbishing columbia

ousted the khmer rouge in late 1978 he reached thailand only after 
a hazardous trek through rice fields filled with the bones of the 
regimes victims

thaicambodian border by haing ngor who portrayed dith in the

prevent the return to power of the khmer rouge and the prospects 
of safe voluntary repatriation of cambodian refugees from 
thailand he said 
dith said the only way to prevent the khmer rouge from returning 
to power was to remove their senior leaders the organizations 
leadership hierachy which includes a role for pol pot the man who 
presided over their rule remains intact 
if you cut the head off a chicken it is easy to deal with the 
body we must not include any of the khmer rouge leaders he said

west germany closed its embassy and 
consulate monday to hundreds of east germans trying reach the west 
through hungary whose liberal refugee and border policies have 
angered some east bloc allies 
officials of the three nations conferred in an attempt to ease 
friction 
on sunday the west german foreign ministry said the embassy and 
consulate would be closed indefinitely beginning monday because the 
staff could not deal with so many people 
hungary has removed the barbed wire and other obstacles from its 
border with austria and east germans are pouring out of their 
strict communist nation which has rejected the political and 
economic reform popular elsewhere in the soviet bloc 
tens of thousands of politically and economically disgruntled 
east germans have gone to west germany this year the largest flow 
to the west since the berlin wall was built in august 1961 to stem a 
similar tide 
dozens of east germans who spent the night outside the west 
german consulate in budapest in cars or sleeping bags were joined by 
scores more on monday despite a sign announcing the closure 
more than 100 had gathered by midafternoon when hungarian red 
cross volunteers arrived with sandwiches and cold drinks 
the embassy and the consulate are temporarily closed said a 
sign handwritten in red letters on the consulate gate in an 
exclusive neighborhood on the buda side of the danube river a 
similar sign was posted on the wroughtiron embassy fence on the 
pest side 
officials in bonn said 181 east germans were inside the embassy 
when the gates were closed and more than 100 soon gathered outside 
at least 1600 east germans are estimated to have crossed 
illegally from hungary to austria since may when this liberal 
soviet bloc nation began dismantling the barriers on its western 
frontier 
in vienna they go to the west germany embassy for documents 
needed to enter that country sources said at least 200 east germans 
arrived at the embassy over the weekend which was the 28th 
anniversary of the berlin wall 
hundreds of others did not make it across the border the daily 
esti hirlap quoted interior ministry officials as saying hungarian 
border guards caught and temporarily detained 471 east germans 
during the weekend 
hungary with a relative abundance of consumer goods and vacation 
spots has been popular with east germans who have difficulty 
traveling legally to the west 
more than 1 million east germans have visited hungary in each of 
the last several years and this year the level has been running 
about 15 percent higher the interior ministry said 
east germans who feared authorities at home were told of their 
attempts to emigrate illegally started going to the west german 
embassy last month many want guarantees of safe passage to the west 
before leaving it 
members of the political opposition in hungary say up to 400 east 
germans have gone underground fearing persecution if they go home 
west germany closed its east berlin mission aug 8 after 131 east 
germans seeking guarantees of passage to west germany sought refuge 
inside 
hanns schumacher spokesman for the foreign ministry in bonn 
said monday that 141 adults and 40 children were in the budapest 
embassy west german media said at least 20 were in the embassy in 
prague czechoslovakia 
east german leader erich honecker was quoted by the official news 
agency adn in east berlin as condemning western media coverage of 
the situating but saying he was ready for qualitatively new 
steps 
officials in bonn said without giving details that chancellor 
helmut kohl sent honecker a personal message friday about the 
refugees 
juergen suedhoff deputy foreign minister of west germany 
conferred with foreign minister gyula horn of hungary on monday but 
details of that meeting also were withheld 
hungarys official news agency mti said the twohour meeting 
dealt with possible humanitarian solutions and that horn later 
called in the east german ambassador gerd vehres for a briefing 
foreign ministry officials acknowledge privately that east 
germany is irritated by the current situation hungary has said 
repeatedly that the matter is between the two germanys 
west germany grants citizenship to any east german who reaches 
the west but obtaining an exit visa in east germany can take years 
east germans with recent military service or important job skills 
are routinely denied permission to leave

president bush signed legislation monday that 
will speed 897 million in assistance to farmers whose crops he said 
had been battered this year by the forces of nature 
the bulk of the aid 400 million will go to wheat farmers 
whose winter harvest in kansas and other states was devastated by 
drought 
at the other extreme the disaster assistance act will compensate 
farmers in the south and elsewhere whose rice soybean cotton and 
other crops were wiped out by rain wind and floods 
the farmer is at the mercy of the forces of nature and 
sometimes nature fails him bush said in a signing ceremony at the 
white house 
bush saying moneys tight said the package will provide 
relief only to those farmers hardest hit by adverse weather and it 
wisely rewards those who took the prudent step of purchasing crop 
insurance 
the house had passed a 14 billion drought relief bill in june 
but under pressure from the white house and the senate it acceded 
last week to the version that came in just under 900 million 
it is about onequarter the size of the 39 billion relief 
package that farmers got to cope with last years devastating 
drought 
this act will help farmers recover after damaging rain and wind 
and will see others through a year when theyve had to stand by and 
watch their crops fail bush said 
in a number of states from the dakotas to the texas panhandle 
and in the midatlantic states as well farmers have indeed 
suffered and this bill provides relief said bush he noted that 
winter wheat in kansas was off by more than 50 percent 
senate minority leader bob dole of kansas who had hoped for more 
aid said farmers were better off with getting the 900 million now 
rather than waiting until september and hoping that congress could 
enact a bigger package 
on the other hand secretary of agriculture clayton yeutter said 
the administration would have preferred a much more limited piece 
of legislation 
although a wide range of crop losses will be covered yeutter 
said the main beneficiaries will be those who lost wheat to the 
drought as well as farmers hit by rains that damaged corn and 
soybeans in the eastern corn belt and cotton in the deep south 
sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee issued a statement hailing the measure and saying 
because of congress quick work winter wheat farmers will be able 
to receive relief before next months planting 
farmers who participated in this years price support program and 
purchased crop insurance will be paid at 65 percent of the target 
price for any losses beyond 35 percent of normal production 
those who were in the program but didnt buy crop insurance will 
be compensated for losses beyond 40 percent of their normal 
production those who were not in the program are eligible only if 
their losses exceed 50 percent 
the new law caps benefits at 100000 for each producer and 
prohibits payments to those with 2 million or more in gross farm 
revenues 
bush said he was pleased that this law loosens some of the 
controls that limit what farmers can plant leaving more farmers 
free then to choose the crops they grow and to diversify 
agricultural production 
sen christopher s bond rmo said that flexibility will allow 
farmers to plant nontraditional crops such as canola rapeseed and 
crambe on up to 20 percent of their base acreage without risking a 
loss of future federal farm payments 
kansas gov mike hayden who also attended the ceremony said 
were very pleased that it could happen as fast as it did farmers 
have got to be able to get the capital to plant this fall this gets 
the money out there so are producers can get back in the field 
now the governor added we would just hope that the rain would 
come

road somewhere they took his picture and posted them in truck 
stops and rest areas ms combs said 
she said said her brother was going to quit his job and start a 
truck repair shop he had been working seven days a week over the

bad weather stalled efforts monday 
to recover the bodies of rep mickey leland and 15 companions from a 
mountain ravine in remote southwestern ethiopia where their plane 
crashed a week ago 
heavy clouds and rain forced two blackhawk helicopters carrying 
recovery teams to return to the capital twice before the weather 
cleared enough for them to make the 250mile flight to the crash 
site in midafternoon 
us embassy spokesman james haley said they arrived too late to 
begin fullscale recovery operations monday 
weve got people down there and have started taking the 
necessary photographs but we wont begin retrieving bodies until 
tomorrow he said 
leland a 44yearold texas democrat who headed the house select 
committee on hunger was on his fifth visit to africa and his second 
this year 
his chartered plane crashed aug 7 en route to fugnido one of 
four camps in southwestern ethiopia run by the un high 
commissioner for refugees they house more than 300000 sudanese who 
have fled war and famine in the neighboring country 
twelve bodies were found sunday on the slopes of a mountain where 
the twin otter crashed on the way to fugnido about 350 miles 
southwest of addis ababa the small twinengine plane apparently 
hit a cliff about 1200 feet below the summit of the 5500foot 
mountain in bad weather 
the four missing bodies were believed to be in the wreckage 
bodies and parts of the plane were strewn over a wide area of the 
barely accessible slope to which searchers had to be lowered from 
helicopters on sunday 
in washington the state department said monday that recovery of 
the bodies will require at least two days of good weather 
officials on the scene believe that the recovery will be a slow 
and laborious process because of the weather the rough terrain and 
the steep incline of the slope where the wreckage is located said 
spokesman richard boucher he said the wreckage was on a 70degree 
slope 
boucher also said ethiopia has accepted an offer from the us 
national transportation safety board to investigate the cause of the 
crash he said a team from the ntsb was en route to ethiopia 
haley said the two blackhawk helicopters would stay overnight at 
gambela 35 miles southeast of the crash site and begin retrieval 
operations at daybreak he said they would be joined by two more 
blackhawks with rescue teams and two c130 cargo planes carrying 
helicopter fuel would leave for the area at dawn 
after being taken by helicopter to nearby dembidola village the 
bodies are to be flown by a c130 to addis ababa nine americans and 
seven ethiopians were on the leland plane 
the bodies of the americans are expected to be taken to the 
united states later this week on a c141 hospital plane sent to 
ethiopia last week according to navy capt stan bloyer in 
washington 
bloyer said a fourmember congressional delegation planned to fly 
to ethiopia to escort the bodies home but would not leave washington 
until the remains had been identified 
reps gary ackerman dny al wheat dmo and the 
sergeantatarms of the house of representatives jack russ left 
ethiopia on monday haley said they had arrived friday to observe 
the search operation

business inventories rose 04 percent in june 
as business sales fell 03 percent the government said monday 
analysts said the report was in line with the economic 
softlanding sought by the federal reserve board slow but 
continued growth with low inflation 
inventories often rise during periods of slow economic growth as 
production exceeds demand a process that sometimes leads to a loss 
of jobs as businesses cut their output 
economists however said recent inventorytosales ratios are 
not unusually high 
inventories are not out of hand yet said howard roth of 
security pacific national bank in los angeles 
the basic message is that inventory vulnerability is fairly 
limited in the economy commented robert g dederick chief 
economist for the northern trust co of chicago this suggests 
that the prospect of an outright recession is limited 
inventories held on shelves and backlots climbed to a seasonally 
adjusted 7808 billion in june the commerce department said the 
04 percent jump followed increases of 09 percent in may and 08 
percent in april 
business sales meanwhile fell 03 percent to a seasonally 
adjusted 5164 billion after rising 01 percent in may and 2 
percent in april the department said sales had last fallen in 
february when they were down 09 percent 
the june report was consistent with recent indicators that 
economic growth had slowed as the federal reserve tightened credit 
to restrain inflation 
in a report friday the labor department said wholesale prices 
one step short of retail had fallen 04 percent in july their 
biggest decline in three years at the same time the commerce 
department reported that retail sales in july had risen a strong 09 
percent after falling 01 percent in june 
roth said the july retail sales report means well probably 
have pretty strong business sales in next report as far as the 
economy is concerned it looks like the softlanding scenario is 
still pretty good 
mondays business sales report includes transactions at three 
levels manufacturing wholesale and retail 
the ratio of inventories to sales in june was 151 meaning it 
would take 151 months to exhaust inventories at the june sales 
pace the ratio had stood at 150 in may and 149 in april 
manufacturers inventories which represent 47 percent of the 
total rose 03 percent while retailers stocks were up 06 
percent wholesalers registered a 01 percent increase 
total inventories were 82 percent higher than in june 1988 
manufacturers sales on the other hand fell 05 percent 
wholesalers sales were off 03 percent while retailers sales were 
down 01 percent 
overall sales were up 62 percent from a year ago

here are provisions of the farm disaster relief 
bill signed by president bush 
the new law 
authorizes an estimated 897 million in federal payments for 
farmers suffering crop losses from 35 percent to 50 percent this 
year because of weatherrelated disasters ranging from drought to 
flooding assistance also would go for replanting fruit trees killed 
by freeze and to small commercial growers who lose trees from 
drought and wildfires this year 
provides payments covering 65 percent of a farmers projected 
lost income from the crop damage in most instances the income 
levels will be based on federal crop subsidies or average market 
prices farmers would have received had they not suffered losses 
expands existing emergency livestock feed and water programs to 
provide more assistance for producers facing droughtrelated 
shortages for their herds for example the law will make money 
available to farmers to provide water for livestock raised in 
confinement facilities and to build or deepen ponds used to water 
livestock 
caps benefits at 100000 for each producer and prohibits 
payments to those with 2 million or more in gross farm revenues 
requires farmers who received disaster assistance to buy federal 
crop insurance in 1990 if their losses this year exceeded 65 percent 
here are the different eligibility standards under the new law 
producers of wheat corn cotton rice and other feed grains 
participating in federal commodity programs and who purchased 
federal crop insurance would be eligible for assistance on losses 
above 35 percent 
farmers without crop insurance but growing the socalled 
program crops must suffer losses of at least 40 percent tobacco 
peanuts and sugar beets are treated as program crops 
soybean and sunflower farmers would be eligible for assistance 
if they suffered losses above 45 percent regardless of whether they 
purchased crop insurance 
most crops not covered by government commodity programs 
everything from cherries and peaches to dry edible beans and 
potatoes must suffer losses exceeding 50 percent 
the same 50 percent loss requirement would apply to farmers who 
are not enrolled in federal commodity programs but grow wheat corn 
grain sorghum and other socalled program crops 
the agriculture department said it soon will publish regulations 
to carry out the program and inform state and county offices of the 
agricultural stabilization and conservation service of how it works 
the law requires the program to be phased in over the next 45 
days spokesman ray waggoner noted 
he said livestock producers winter wheat farmers and others 
should be able to figure losses quickly from crops already 
harvested while more time will be needed to tally the losses from 
corn soybeans and other crops being harvested in the fall

estonias communist party chief called monday for 
russian workers in his republic to end a sixday strike and 
negotiate differences 
unrest flared in the southern republic of azerbaijan meanwhile 
with thousands of people holding a rally and saying they would 
concentrate their strike on key industries 
strike leaders in estonias capital of tallinn said at least 
20000 russian workers stayed off the job to protest a new law that 
tightens residency requirements for voters and candidates 
we met with strike committee representatives and they later 
said they were not satisfied with the results if so lets continue 
the talks party chief vaino vyalyas said in an estonian tv 
interview 
staterun moscow radio said the strike cost millions of dollars 
it said the estonian law will take the right to vote away from 
more than 100000 nonestonians in the republic of 16 million

unwanted children carry their emotional 
neediness into young adulthood according to a study of a group 
whose mothers tried twice to abort them a researcher said monday 
at ages 21 to 23 the unwanted children showed greater risk of 
problems than a matched sample of other children said henry p 
david a maryland researcher who did the study in czechoslovakia at 
least one american psychiatrist questioned the studys credibility 
the problems included greater proneness to drug and alcohol abuse 
or crime less job satisfaction more conflict with coworkers and 
supervisors less satisfaction with friends and more disappointments 
in love david said 
a larger proportion had their first sexual intercourse before age 
15 and had sexual relations with more than 10 partners david said 
among married people the unwanted group more often judged their 
marriages to be less happy and significantly more often said they 
wished they were not married or not married to their current partner 
david is the director of the transnational family research 
institute in bethesda md a nonprofit organization that studies 
reproductive behavior 
he described the work at a news conference at the annual meeting 
of the american psychological associatioe percentage with a stepfather 
said nigro who is president 
of a local physicians group that opposes abortion 
david in a statement distributed at the press conference said 
the children were matched for age sex school class birth order 
and number of siblings but some threechild families had to be 
matched with twochild families the statement said 
mothers were matched for age socioeconomic status and the 
presence of a husband or partner in the home the statement said 
the study tracked 220 people born in 1961 to 1963 whose mothers 
had twice sought to abort them and compared them to 220 children 
whose mothers had wanted or at least accepted their pregnancies 
the denied abortions were blocked by czech authorities who ruled 
on abortion requests david said that power has since been 
abolished partly as a result of the study david said 
the study also found evidence of more problems among unwanted 
childeren at ages 9 and 14 to 16 david said

there hasnt been a principal running the 
hill city school since last year and the district is not even 
looking for one 
a committee of teachers runs the school with supervision from 
the district superintendent as part of a threeyear experiment that 
takes teacherpower to a new level 
the idea of giving more power to teachers sometimes known as 
sitebased management or shared decisionmaking is being widely 
advocated by school reformers and rural schools have been known to 
share or do without a principal to save money but only one other 
district in minnesota has gone as far as hill city in letting 
teachers run a school outright 
its not perfect but i think if you were to go in the 
building and ask if morale is better theyd say yes said linda 
bauer a counselor and teacher on hill citys share team 
people here have the chance to express their opinions and 
views we use the strengths of all people on the staff bus 
drivers cooks people who have a unique perspective on whats going 
on in a students life 
hill citys school has about 330 students in kindergarten to 
grade 12 the share team about to begin its second year of 
managing the school has two elementary teachers two secondary 
teachers and the school secretary teachers are paid roughly 4400 
extra for the team work 
last year the team met daily for about 45 minutes before school 
and had regular weekly meetings lasting about 2 hours the 
secretary made many decisions about such things as office supplies 
and one team member was free each day to function as a 
quasiprincipal 
not everyone in this northcentral minnesota community of 360 
and the rural area around it that also sends children to its school 
has been happy with the experiment vernon bishop a new school 
board member said parents have been frustrated with the lack of a 
principal and some believe the system jeopardizes confidentiality 
im willing to give this a chance he said but for 
parents i have talked to its a real big concern 
superintendent darrell nelson said some parents dont like the 
fact that substitute teachers fill in for the team members when they 
are doing management duties 
richard mesenberg manager of the state department of educations 
office of educational leadership says he doesnt recommend the hill 
city system because sometimes committees cant make decisions 
but in general mesenberg said parent and teacher involvement in 
school decisions is the first part of a longterm change in american 
education were making schools fundamentally different than they 
were yesterday he said 
state officials estimate 25 to 30 of minnesotas 435 school 
districts are seriously involved in some form of decentralized 
management 
there is no model and that frustrates people said ted suss 
administrator for the state board of education but fostering a 
model for local schools to follow would undo the very reason for 
decentralization in the first place he said 
two of the states biggest school districts minneapolis and st 
paul are set to begin organized efforts this fall to give schools 
more local control winona enrollment 4600 has one of the states 
oldest programs the districts 10 regular schools have had school 
site councils with teachers and principals for five years

the state department sharply condemned syria 
and its allies monday for the eruption of largescale ground 
fighting in lebanon and said the turmoil makes us efforts to gain 
the release of american hostages more difficult 
there was no indication however that the bush administration 
was preparing any new diplomatic initiative to try to force the 
warring factions to the negotiating table instead the state 
department again deferred to the arab league as being in the best 
position to seek a settlement in the 14year civil war between 
muslim and christian forces 
the condemnation of syria whose hold on lebanese territory 
appears to be expanding was delivered by spokesman richard boucher 
at the departments daily press briefing 
an official who requested anonymity said the us concern had 
been conveyed to the syrians in recent meetings in damascus 
boucher told reporters that syriasupported forces have joined 
the latest round of fighting in lebanon 
this represents an irresponsible escalation of the violence 
syria and its allies should refrain from any further escalation and 
accept immediately international and arab league calls for a 
ceasefire and a lifting of the blockade of christian ports 
at the same time boucher urged the christians to observe a 
ceasefire and to join in the political reconstruction of the 
country this means in effect agreeing to powersharing 
arrangements with muslims that would reduce christian maronite 
influence in the country 
the united states has turned to syria as well as a number of 
other parties including the soviet union in the latest effort to 
free the eight americans believed to be held hostage in southern 
lebanon 
but boucher said that clearly the unsettled situation in beirut 
makes the situation regarding the hostages more difficult he did 
not elaborate 
in the past syria has played an occasionally helpful role on 
behalf of captive americans and earned us expressions of 
gratitude it has also been the target of nowlifted sanctions 
imposed after the state department concluded that damascus had 
supported terrorism 
apart from its dominant position in lebanon syria is the only 
major arab ally of iran shiite supporters of iran are believed to 
be holding all the american hostages 
largescale ground fighting over the weekend carried the latest 
fivemonth spate of violence in lebanon to bloodier heights muslim 
and leftist militia aligned with syria mounted an offensive near suk 
al gharb eight miles east of beirut and broke through the defense 
lines of christian forces led by gen michael aoun 
iraq an implacable foe of syria is aiding the christians in 
their faltering attempts to stem the muslim advance 
boucher in response to a question reiterated us support for 
the territorial integrity of lebanon asked what the bush 
administration might do next if syria did not relent the us 
official said 
we have to see where we go next thats a job for the whole 
international community 
he said the united states was engaged in a broadbased effort 
to support peacemaking efforts of the un security council and 
france as well as of the arab league 
we are actively involved boucher said but he repeated 
the arab league is in the best position to bring about some 
solution to the problems of lebanon

syrian troops were reported massing near 
an important christian garrison monday for what the christians 
feared would be a new attempt to break through their defenses new 
artillery duels killed eight people 
a police spokesman and sources in gen michel aouns army said 
the syrians were assembling troops and armor in the central 
mountains at douar east of beirut 
douar is 11 miles from another strategic christian position that 
was attacked sunday in the first ground assault since the latest 
fighting broke out in march between syrian and christian forces 
the syrians are bringing in t62 tanks and dozens of mortars of 
various calibers to positions overlooking douar said an aoun 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
sources at aouns headquarters said the syrian national socialist 
party a damascus ally was joining in the troop buildup at douar 
along the main road that leads through the mountains from the 
syrianheld bekaa valley 
the party composed mainly of greek orthodox fighters hostile to 
the maronite catholics who dominate the christian camp previously 
has stayed out of the fighting 
syrianbacked palestinian radicals joined the fighting for the 
first time sunday when they helped attack the christian stronghold 
of souk elgharb 
a syrian military spokesman in damascus denied syrian forces were 
involved in the assault on souk elgharb but aouns headquarters 
said the syrians threw most of their 41st brigade into the battle 
police said 70 attackers including 25 syrians were killed in 
the battle and that four defenders were killed 
souk elgharb was heavily shelled again monday and aouns aides 
said the christians were bracing for another assault 
were ready to take them on again an aoun aide said as 
mortar and tank fire hit the onetime resort which was abandoned by 
civilians six years ago 
the mountaintop garrison under siege by syrianbacked moslem 
forces since 1983 controls a network of roads that twist through 
lebanons central range into the christian enclave which fans out 
north of beirut 
syrian gunners shelled the enclave again monday police said 
eight people were killed and 66 wounded bringing the casualty toll 
since the duels began march 8 to 741 dead and 1950 wounded 
at least 37 civilians were killed and 120 wounded between 
midnight saturday and midnight sunday 
in washington the state department sharply condemned syria and 
its allies in connection with the ground fighting in lebanon and 
said the bloodshed makes us efforts to gain the release of 
american hostages more difficult 
department spokesman said richard boucher said syria and its 
allies should refrain from any further escalation and accept 
immediately international and arab league calls for a ceasefire and 
a lifting of the blockade of christian ports 
he also called on the christians to observe a ceasefire and to 
join in the political reconstruction of the country 
the fighting which broke out after aoun blockaded illegal 
militiarun ports has left much of beirut in ruins more than 85 
percent of the citys 15 million people have fled 
in the barbir district of moslem west beirut one of the 
worsthit neighborhoods cars smoldered in streets carpeted with 
broken glass and rubble 
in ras alnabaa virtually every building was damaged alleyways 
were blocked by crumbled buildings broken power cables dangled from 
splintered poles 
rescue teams used a lull in the fighting to pull civilians from 
wrecked burned out buildings many buildings still smoldered 
because fire crews were unable to reach them 
dazed beirutis emerged from their shelters some had been 
underground for three or four days long lines formed outside the 
few bakeries that opened sandbagged supermarkets were crowded 
this is sadism said ali shaker a history professor at the 
american university of beirut beirut has been murdered but the 
murderer is not satisfied he is mutilating its corpse piece by 
piece 
aoun said monday he was determined to drive the 40000 syrian 
troops from lebanon and that a truce would achieve nothing 
syria only understands the language of force he said in an 
interview with frances rtl radio we must make syria leave 
lebanon by force a ceasefire is not a national objective 
the syrian troops were deployed in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate but aoun said they betrayed that mandate by 
siding with the moslems in the 14yearold civil war and declared a 
war of liberation against them 
but aouns 20000 soldiers are heavily outgunned and outnumbered 
by the syrians and their allies who can muster abourt 60000 
fighters 
mondays bombardment began with sporadic syrian salvoes around 
dawn after an 11hour overnight lull it intensified by midday into 
sustained barrages on christian east beirut and north along the 
coast 
aouns guns retaliated against syrian gun positions in and around 
west beirut 
police said the hilltop presidential palace in christian east 
beirut where aoun has an underground headquarters bunker was 
repeatedly hit by syrian mortars and rockets a spokesman said aoun 
and his aides were safe

four armed fugitives holding three 
people hostage in an armored car agreed saturday to exchange their 
captives for a pilot and airplane to fly them to paraguay officials 
reported 
the kidnappers were identified as two married couples who earlier 
obtained a 42000 ransom to free a nineyearold boy they had 
abudcted they accepted the offer of a plane in place of a 
helicopter they had demanded earlier and promised to release the 
three hostages unharmed the sao paulo state security department 
said 
the plane has landed on the highway where the armored car is 
located and is refueling now security department spokesman jairo 
pires told the associated press by telephone they the fugitives 
agreed to board the plane fully armed and then release the three 
hostages 
an earlier plan to provide a helicopter for the kidnappers 
getaway fell through when the pilots of the only two helicopters in 
the area in southcenteral brazil refused to fly the kidnappers 
unless they first surrendered their arms 
pires said a local rancher from the city of presidente prudente 
who alsi os a pilot volunteered to fly the fugitives to paraguay in 
a sixseat plene presidente purdente is near the site of the 
standoff and 636 miles southwest 
the rancher volunteered to make the flight when negotiations 
were at a critical impasse 
he gave no further details and declined to say when the exchange 
might be made and the plane could takeoff 
police said the helicoter pilots refused the mission because the 
kidnappers demanded that they be allowed to take with them grenades 
a submachine gun pistols and shotguns 
we have no idea where the plane may be going osmar saraiva 
a duty officer at the presidente prudente police precinct said in a 
phone interview it has a fuel capacity of fouranda half hours 
time enough to go anywhere 
pires said the hostages two television reporters and the driver 
of the armored car were in fair physical condition the armored 
car has been surrounded by about 100 police including 
shasrpshooters since early friday 
the kidnappers began their crime spree on aug 3 when they 
abducted a boy from his home in goiania 852 miles northwest of rio 
 
six days after the kidnapping police found the house on the 
outskirts of goiania where the two couples were holding the boy 
police exchanged the boy for 42000 the armored car a driver and 
three local television reporters 
after releasing one of the reporters the kidnappers headed for 
the goiania airport where authorities refused to provide an 
airplane in exchange the hostages 
the armored car then sped off on a 500mile jaunt through three 
states with the police close behind during one stop at a roadside 
cafe one kidnapper stepped out of the armored car and held a pistol 
to a hostages head 
the chase ended early friday when the kidnappers stopped on a 
highway near presidente prudente 635 miles southwest of rio and 
demanded a helicopter in exchange for their three hostages 
an air force helicopter was summoned from brasilia to the 
presidente prudente airport and a private helicopter arrived later 
jairo pires spokesman for the sao paulo state security department 
said by telephone 
but a 3 pm 2 pm edt deadline set by the kidnappers passed 
when the helicopter pilots refused to fly the couples unless they 
surrendered their grenades machine gun and two shotguns 
about 100 heavily armed police continued to surround the armored 
car and sharpshooters aimed their rifles at the vehicles small 
windows 
the three local television reporters who volunteered to take the 
boys place at the beginning of the drama were identified as solange 
franco monica calassa and carla monteiro the kidnappers later 
released monteiro 
the standoff was the third in four months in which criminals took 
hostages

bus in the northeastern state of bahia after an unsuccessful bank 
robbery attempt

president bushs spokesman on monday praised 
the federal reserves good job on the national economy seeking 
to soften the sting from an attack on fed policy by bushs budget 
director 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that the 
administration was seeking continued economic growth with low 
inflation we believe the economy is generally on that course at the 
present time and the fed is doing a good job 
but at the same time fitzwater did not repudiate the statements 
made on sunday by budget director richard darman fitzwater noted 
that bush has made similar comments himself in the past 
darman interviewed on nbcs meet the press said the fed was 
keeping interest rates too high and would shoulder the blame if the 
country falls into a recession 
saying he feared the fed may have been a little too tight 
darman urged the central bank to do more to lower interest rates and 
said the fed should be more attentive to the need to avoid tipping 
the economy into a recession 
private economists were surprised by the timing of darmans 
remarks given the fact that recent economic statistics suggest 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan may be succeeding in his 
effort to achieve a soft landing in which economic growth slows 
enough to dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the country 
into a recession 
some analysts suggested that darman was positioning the federal 
reserve to take the blame should the economy falter before next 
years congressional elections 
this is a classic situation of setting up the fed to be the 
fall guy if something goes wrong said robert dederick chief 
economist at northern trust co of chicago 
economists said it was unlikely that darmans remarks would have 
any impact on upcoming fed decisions top fed policymakers will meet 
again in washington on aug 22 and many economists said they 
expected the central bank to hold interest rates steady and not ease 
further 
from march 1988 through march 1989 the federal reserve pushed 
shortterm interest rates up by about 3 percentage points in an 
effort to dampen economic growth as a way of cooling inflationary 
pressures starting in june the fed reversed course and has made a 
modest effort to lower interest rates in order to keep the economy 
from tumbling into a recession 
those moves which have made more money available to the banking 
system have allowed banks to cut their prime lending rate since 
early june by a full percentage point to 105 percent currently 
home mortgage rates have declined as well to the lowest levels in 
two years 
but with recent signs that economic growth is not as sluggish as 
feared many analysts said they were not looking for the fed to push 
interest rates lower in the near future 
so long as the economy is ok there is no reason for the fed to 
ease any more said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
sinai said mortgage rates may even climb by about onefourth 
percentage point as financial markets realize that the central bank 
has decided to hold off on further easing moves 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm said that 
darmans comments had made it more difficult for the fed to ease 
right away because the independent central bank would appear to be 
bowing to political pressure a situation which rattles financial 
markets 
i dont think the fed has the political option to ease right 
now after darmans broadside evans said 
paul getman senior economist at the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa consulting firm suggested that darman may have felt compelled 
to attack the fed because of the justsigned legislation bailing out 
the savings and loan industry 
that measure projects spending 166 billion through 1999 to close 
or merge failing sampls an estimate which could balloon if interest 
rate assumptions used by the administration turn out to be too 
optimistic 
the administrations forecast of the bailout is predicated on 
low interest rates darman knows that getman said 
darmans comments marked the first critical administration 
statements since last winter when bush and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady both complained that the feds yearlong effort to 
push interest rates higher ran the risk of aborting the record 
peacetime expansion now in its seventh year

said is a modified kh12 spy satellite designed to photograph 
military targets the astronauts also reportedly performed 
experiments related to the star wars antimissile defense system 
it was a very clean flight so we didnt have a lot of 
problems montgomery said 
she said columbia probably will leave here saturday for a twoday 
piggyback flight back to cape canaveral fla atop a modified 
boeing 747 jetliner 
when columbia was launched from florida last tuesday pilot 
richard richards seat jerked backward about one inch but the 
malfunction caused no problems montgomery said 
it was exciting when it happened but richards used a motor 
control to move the seat forward to its normal position and it 
stayed she added 
the shuttles commander and pilot actually do very little during 
the spacecrafts liftoff which is almost entirely controlled by 
computers 
a leaky inflight steering thruster will need replacing but 
columbias crew shut it down during the flight and used other 
thrusters montgomery said 
only three of the shuttles roughly 30000 heatshielding tiles 
were damaged enough to require replacement based on initial 
inspection she said a more detailed inspection was underway monday 
two of the tiles are on the bottom of the orbiter and may have 
been gouged when yetunidentified debris fell from the shuttle when 
it was launched she added the third damaged tile which was 
chipped is located on the main landing gear door 
montgomery said workers will examine about 20 other minor 
potential problems that developed just before or during columbias 
flight including some instrument glitches and failure of a thruster 
heater and a nozzle that dumps water from the orbiter 
columbias brakes and landing gear were in such good shape that 
they didnt need to be removed before the shuttle was towed off the 
hard clay runway on which it landed only the second time that has 
happened she said 
montgomery said she didnt know why columbia appeared dirty but 
indicated the discolorations were heat streaks caused during 
reentry 
columbias mission brought the shuttle fleet back up to three 
orbiters columbia is the oldest it last flew in january 1986 
landing 10 days before challenger exploded after liftoff killing 
seven crew members after the accident nasa concentrated on making 
safety modifications to the two newer shuttles discovery and 
atlantis before refurbishing columbia 
columbia is scheduled to be launched again dec 18 to deploy a 
navy communications satellite and retrieve a bussized scientific 
satellite that will fall to earth within several months if not 
plucked from its decaying orbit 
the next shuttle flight is scheduled for oct 12 when atlantis 
will carry the galileo space probe into earth orbit so it can be 
launched on a sixyear voyage to jupiter

sinhalese extremists called for a 
oneday general strike tuesday to demand withdrawal of indian 
peacekeeping soldiers 
military officials said monday that 14 more people were killed in 
the islands ethnic violence 
the killings were reported around central and southern sri lanka 
where members of the majority ethnic sinhalese dominate on sunday 
and monday military officials said 
the strike was called to coincide with indias independence day 
the antigovernment peoples liberation front announced the strike 
through posters and leaflets in the capital and its suburbs 
the sinhaleselanguage posters warned people to stay indoors 
several earlier strikes called by the front have been largely 
successful 
mondays posters denounced the presence of an estimated 43000 
indian soldiers 
the soldiers were deployed in the northeast to oversee a 1987 
peace accord that aimed to end an ethnic tamil insurrection for an 
independent nation 
the ultranationalist front says the presence of indian troops 
compromises the countrys sovereignty it also says the government 
is making too many concessions to the tamil militants who began 
their separatist campaign in 1983 
the tamils say they suffer discrimination from sinhalese who 
make up 75 percent of the populationtamils comprise 18 percent of 
sri lankas 16 million people 
president ranasinghe premadasa has asked india to withdraw its 
soldiers but the results have failed to appease the extremists 
india has pulled out 2220 soldiers since premadasa made the 
request june 1 but says a quick withdrawal of all troops could lead 
to more violence 
instead it has said it will withdraw its soldiers in phases 
pulling them all out by february 
the government accuses the front of killing at least 4000 people 
during the last two years about 11000 other people have died in 
the 6yearold tamil revolt 
with the latest killings the toll in the extremist violence 
since saturday rose to 72 the military officials said

pw botha practiced 
fingerwagging confrontational politics for more than 50 years and 
ultimately it cost him the support of even his staunchest allies in 
the ruling national party 
nicknamed the great crocodile for his feared temper and 
sometimes ruthless manner botha has served as head of government 
for 11 rocky years 
he has a gift for making enemies as other men have a gift for 
friendship newspaper editor ken owen once wrote 
botha liked to depict himself as the first south african leader 
to pursue race reform but he tenaciously defended the framework of 
apartheid while leading south africa through its worst racial 
violence and deepest international isolation 
bothas foremost loyalties were to his fellow afrikaners yet his 
moves to extend limited political power to nonwhites split the 
white tribe prompting a mass defection of hardline segregationists 
from the national party in 1982 
within the antiapartheid movement botha was reviled but rarely 
underestimated as prime minister and later as president his 
unpredictable blend of reform and repression kept militant activists 
off balance and enabled his government to maintain political and 
military dominance despite sanctions unrest and guerrilla attacks 
botha was in unquestioned control of the government until he 
suffered a stroke jan 18 
a week later while still recuperating he resigned as leader of 
the national party and was replaced by education minister fw de 
klerk a man botha did not support 
botha 73 appears to have recovered from his stroke but not 
from his loss of political control 
he wanted to stay on as president ostensibly above party 
politics but the national party caucus made it clear in march it 
preferred that he step down immediately he went on national 
television to reject the suggestion but was forced to agree to 
retirement after the sept 6 parliamentary elections 
his bitterness became more obvious as he abruptly refused to 
attend a farewell banquet held in his honor by the party he had 
served for 54 years then he appeared unannounced at a provincial 
party congress requiring de klerk to give up his seat at the head 
table 
his meeting with imprisoned african national congress leader 
nelson mandela was praised but it added to the growing impression 
that he was capable of any unpredictable act to embarrass de klerk 
botha found it necessary to announce i am not a sulking old 
man 
but with less than a month to go before the crucial elections 
botha provoked another public confrontation apparently 
underestimating the support de klerk enjoyed from the entire cabinet 
botha said friday he had not been properly informed of a planned 
aug 28 trip to zambia by de klerk and foreign minister pik botha 
the meeting is an opening to black africa that botha had worked hard 
to accomplish and he had hoped to be the one making the trip 
his decision to make public a dispute about a procedural point 
not only embarrassed his party but was seen as an unwarranted 
attack on the veracity of the foreign minister pik botha no 
relation to the president had served him loyally for 11 years and 
is credited with swinging his own supporters to pw botha in the 
tight battle for the prime ministership in 1978 
born jan 12 1916 the son of a farmer in the rural orange free 
state province botha never served in the military or graduated from 
college he quit university in 1935 to become a national party 
organizer 
during world war ii botha joined the ossewabrandwag ox wagon 
fire guard a group that was sympathetic to the nazis and opposed 
south africas participation on the allied side 
botha won election to parliament in 1948 the year the national 
party came to power and began codifying apartheid legislation he 
joined the cabinet in 1961 and was named defense minister in 1966 
he became head of the whiteminority government sept 28 1978 
and repeatedly stressed the paramount importance of national 
security in the face of what he called a communistled total 
onslaught 
in 1984 botha helped push through a new constitution that 
brought asians and people of mixedrace into the previously 
allwhite parliament but continued to exclude the 28million black 
majority 
the constitution also changed bothas title from prime minister 
to president with drastically increased powers he used them to 
declare a national emergency which after three years has stifled 
the political violence that resulted from black anger over the new 
constitution 
botha was credited with repealing some of apartheids most 
hurtful laws but he made clear he would never consider the 
possibility of blackmajority government he also promised that as 
long as he was president whites would retain segregated schools and 
neighborhoods 
critics on the left said bothas reforms were merely cosmetic 
while rightwing whites accused him of capitulating to blacks

a man arrested at the capitol for killing 
seven pigeons if they beat him to a peanut thrown by tourists could 
have gotten a meal the executive director of one downtown soup 
kitchen said monday 
what i couldnt understand was if this was going on on a 
continuing basis why didnt the people stop feeding the pigeons 
said margaret dockery executive director of the shepherds table 
soup kitchen about two blocks from where the man was arrested 
there are plenty of places around here to eat 
people feeding peanuts to pigeons sunday evening near capitol 
square told police a man was killing any bird that reached a nut 
before he did police said if a pigeon beat the man to the nuts he 
would wring its neck 
police said they had no idea if the incidents on sunday were the 
first time such a thing had occurred 
eladio castillo 65 was cited for violating a city ordinance 
that makes it illegal to trap hunt or otherwise kill 
starlings or similar birds or fowl in an area declared a bird 
sanctuary by the city lt rc friese said 
castillo is scheduled for a sept 18 court appearance the 
citation carries an unspecified fine and court costs as penalty 
although there were two soup kitchens within blocks of capitol 
square including the shepherds table neither was open at the time 
castillo was cited the shepherds table closes on weekends and the 
salvation armys kitchen opened at noon sunday but closed 30 
minutes later according to a spokeswoman for the raleigh mission 
ms dockery said she wasnt familiar with castillo although she 
said she might recognize him if he had been to her kitchen she said 
if the man had been in raleigh for any time he should have known 
about the shepherds table 
its very well known she said we have been down here for 
nine years theres a camaraderie among the folks even if they 
dont know the precise hours we have a sign in the window 
ms dockery said she has encountered people in her kitchen who 
have needed more than attention to their nutrition 
what is the major gap is in the mental health problem she 
said a lot of times one will make the other worse they will 
come in here sometimes and its very obvious that they havent been 
eating because their minds are not organized enough to take care of 
themselves 
ann burke director of urban ministries said she is aware that 
the hungry will go through trash bins in search of food but she had 
never heard of anyone fighting animals for food

irans spiritual leader said monday there 
would be no dealings with the cursed united states but the 
foreign minister left open the possibility of negotiations on 
american hostages held in lebanon 
american conditions for negotiations with iran are 
ridiculous said ayatollah ali khamenei most of the 16 western 
hostages in lebanon including eight americans are believed held by 
proiranian kidnappers 
tehran radio said khamenei addressed these comments to us 
leaders next to the usurper regime ruling over occupied palestine 
israel you are the most cursed government in the eyes of the 
iranian people no one in the islamic republic will hold talks with 
you 
he was speaking to relatives of prisoners of war held by iraq and 
of soldiers missing in action in the 8year war with iraq in which 
a ceasefire was reached a year ago the radio report was monitored 
in nicosia 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati arrived in damascus syria 
monday when asked about the hostage situation he said without 
elaboration no negotiations before the release of sheik abdul 
karim obeid 
obeid is a shiite moslem cleric kidnapped by israeli commandos 
july 28 from his home in southern lebanon israel has offered to 
exchange him for three israeli soldiers captured in lebanon and the 
16 western hostages 
the differing viewpoints expressed by khamenei and velayati 
reflects the divisions in the iranian leadership on whether to help 
arrange the release of the western captives terry andekson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press has been held 
the longest he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
velayati said he was in syria for talks on the situation in 
lebanon and had brought a letter to president hafez assad from 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran 
his remark on possible negotiations reflected a commentary sunday 
by irans official islamic republic news agency outlining conditions 
for release of the hostages 
the agency said iran would use its maximum influence for the 
release of all the hostages if the united states freed 2 billion 
in iranian assets the assets were frozen 10 years ago after 
iranians seized the us embassy in tehran and held 52 americans 
hostage for 444 days 
it also linked freedom for the hostages to the release of obeid 
who is affiliated with the iraniansponsored hezbollah or party of 
god and to settlement of lebanons 14yearold sectarian civil war 
if the us government really wants to solve the hostage issue 
in lebanon and has no plot in mind it should first put israel under 
pressure to free sheik obeid at once the commentary said 
secondly it should present a comprehensive plan for the release 
of all the hostages including the iranian ones and the lebanese 
captives held by israel 
iran has long demanded the release of three iranians missing in 
lebanon since 1982 who are believed to be dead 
irna said iran would ask the oppressed lebanese moslems to take 
new steps toward solving the hostage crisis provided release of 
the hostages would be a first step toward the return of 
independence to lebanon and restoration of the rights of its 
moslems 
president bush said four days ago his administration wanted 
better relations with iran but would not engage in trading off or 
negotiating for hostages 
khamenei usually considered a supporter of the those iranian 
leaders known as pragmatists did not specifically mention the 
western hostages but said of the obeid kidnapping in lebanon 
america commits its greatest atrocities and encourages its puppet 
israel in kidnapping and hostagetaking 
khamenei was chosen as irans religious leader to succeed 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the iranian revolutionary patriarch who 
died june 3 
rafsanjani leader of the pragmatists has indicated willingness 
to negotiate with the united states on aug 4 he said there were 
reasonable prudent solutions to the problem of freeing the 
hostages 
radicals in tehran led by interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi have expressed opposition to any dealings with 
washington 
western intelligence officials say mohtashemi was a founder of 
hezbollah believed to be an umbrella group for shiite moslem kidnap 
gangs in lebanon

africanized honeybees are still heading north 
across mexico but are not expected to arrive in the united states 
until 1991 or later the agriculture department said monday 
popularly called killer bees by some including movie 
writers the migrating bees were originally expected to reach the 
southern united states in 1987 or 1988 then maybe 1989 or 1990 
but department officials now say the bees wont reach the rio 
grande valley of southern texas for another 18 months or later 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said a joint project with mexico 
has delayed the bees arrival and should give researchers and 
beekeepers enough time to study the bee and learn how to manage it 
the africanized honeybee is the hybrid offspring of european 
honeybees and pure african queen bees brought to brazil in 1956 for 
research the african queens escaped and began interbreeding with 
native honeybees 
africanized bees have been migrating northward since then and 
were found in southern mexico in 1986 today they are about 400 
miles south of the us border near tecolutla in the mexican state 
of veracruz 
although the venom of africanized bees is no more potent than 
that of the european bees that are common throughout the united 
states the hybrids can be more dangerous because of their 
aggressiveness and the likelihood of them stinging in greater 
numbers 
besides the notoriety as a fierce pest around humans and animals 
the africanized honeybee also is feared by many commercial 
beekeepers for what it might do to their industry 
glosser said his agency began working with the mexican government 
two years ago in a cooperative program to control the africanized 
bees 
the program includes the detection and tracking of the bees as 
they near the us border trapping and destruction of swarms to 
reduce their numbers and efforts to alter the bees genetically so 
they pose less of a threat 
program personnel in mexico have hung almost 60000 traps in 
the last 18 months and have caught more than 11000 swarms of 
africanized bees glosser said thats millions of africanized 
bees that will never reach the united states 
the project in mexico also uses requeening to reduce the 
transfer of africanized traits to regular honeybee colonies 
beekeepers are encouraged to select queens from desirable genetic 
stock and mark them with a bright paint so that its easy to tell if 
they are in the hive if an unmarked queen is noted that female is 
replaced with a marked queen known to be of good genetic stock

a federal judge monday permitted gulf coast 
shrimp fishermen to temporarily avoid using devices attached to 
their nets that protect endangered species of sea turtles 
us district court judge thomas hogan refused to disturb an 
interim step instituted by the us commerce department restricting 
trawling times to 105minute intervals 
the national wildlife federation said the 105minute requirement 
fails to protect endangered sea turtles and has asked the judge to 
require the shrimpers to equip their nets with the turtle excluder 
devices called teds 
hogan refused to rule on the merits of the 105minute 
requirement saying he would await a final rule by the commerce 
secretary 
the interim restriction satisfies the courts order that some 
conservation measures be put in place while permanent modification 
of the existing ted regulations are being considered hogan said 
it remains to be seen how the secretary will justify the sudden 
shift away from teds and the adoption of a 105minute tow time 
restriction said the judge 
hogan said the national wildlife federation raised substantial 
concerns in a lawsuit regarding the adequacy of the 105minute tow 
time restriction but called it premature to rule on their 
objections 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has data from national marine 
fisheries service scientists showing the mortality rate from a 
105minute tow time is more than four times greater than what the 
secretary has admitted says the federation 
following an order issued by the judge mosbacher issued the 
105minute interim requirement it became effective aug 8 and 
expires sept 8 
mosbacher decided july 24 to suspend requirements for excluder 
devices after texas and louisiana shrimp fishermen protested their 
use by blockadng gulf coast shipping channels the fishermen say the 
turtle excluder devices reduce their catch by as much as a third 
hogan concluded that mosbacher had failed to show good cause for 
suspending the existing ted regulations for 45 days without adopting 
an interim conservation measure 
the secretary has utterly failed to show how the 45day 
suspension of any protection for endangered and threatened turtles 
during the height of the gulf shrimping season will foster 
conservation said hogans 17page opinion 
the wildlife federation seeking to force the commerce department 
to require the gulf coast shrimpers to use the teds sued mosbacher 
the same day he suspended the regulations 
the wildlife group is disappointed that the court is not 
requiring the use of the excluder devices said robert irvin a 
lawyer for the wildlife federation we think that the 105minute 
tow time limit does not protect the turtles and that the government 
has not presented any evidence to the contrary 
irvin said he is pleased with the portion of hogans ruling 
which makes it very clear that the secretary had no justification 
legal or factual for the suspension of the regulation 
the excluder devices are big boxes with hinged sides attached to 
nets which allow turtles to swim through 
most shrimpers in south carolina will continue to use the turtle 
excluder devices or teds rather than pull their nets up every 105 
minutes said wally shaffer executive director of the south 
carolina shrimpers association 
since south carolina shrimpers can only drag their nets during 
daylight pulling the nets every 105 minutes for a halfhour would 
substantially cut back the number of shrimp caught shaffer said 
what it does mean is if a fisherman chose to go without teds 
he would have to have the nets out for two and a half or three hours 
a day he said so most of them have chosen to use teds 
south carolina mandated the use of the device before the ted 
regulation went into effect for other states

prime minister czeslaw kiszczak said monday 
he is ready to resign and abandon his bid to form a new government 
so that the head of the smaller united peasant party can form a 
coalition government 
a solidarity senator said the move appeared designed to block 
lech walesas attempt to form a government that excludes the 
communist party 
a solidarityled coalition has alarmed the soviet union and would 
be the first noncommunist government in the east bloc since the 
late 1940s 
walesa has been trying for a week to persuade the peasant party 
led by roman malinowski and aligned with the communists in 
parliament to join in a noncommunist coalition walesa has said he 
cannot support any government formed by kiszczak 
a situation has emerged in which i see a chance for roman 
malinowski to form a new government in which there would be 
representatives of all forces in the parliament kiszczak said in 
a statement carried by the pap news agency 
at the same time it would be a clear sign indicating the 
priority given to agriculture and the food economy in polands 
policy kiszczak said 
solidarity sen jaroslaw kaczynski walesas envoy to coalition 
talks said the independent trade union movement would not abandon 
its efforts to form a government 
kaczynski said kiszczak was trying to make it very 
difficult if not impossible for solidarity to form the 
government but that he did not think that the proposal of 
malinowski for prime minister would succeed 
solidarity lawmaker henryk wujec the first opposition lawmaker 
to respond to the proposal of malinowski to lead a government 
called it an idiotic move and in all likelihood unacceptable to 
walesa 
kiszczak was elected prime minister aug 2 winning a majority in 
parliament despite opposition from the solidarity caucus which 
holds 35 percent the seats in the lower house 
walesa announced aug 7 he wanted to form a coalition government 
and his representatives began talks thursday with malinowskis 
united peasant party and the democrats the minor parties that hold 
the balance of power 
the united peasant party which claims a membership of 500000 
has been allied with the communists since its creation in 1949 after 
the forced merger of a procommunist peasant party and an opposition 
peasant party it has been allowed to develop a more independent 
policy in the last decade and about onethird of its 76 deputies 
support solidarity 
the communist party responded with alarm when walesa proposed 
forming the government on friday the soviet union joined in with 
expressions of concern warning against possible harm to the 
stability of of poland and europe 
by offering a noncommunist such as malinowski to head the 
government which in itself would be a first in postwar poland 
the communist party apparently hopes avoid the onceunthinkable 
prospect of a solidarity government from coming true 
kiszczak said he had been trying to assemble a cabinet but 
walesas proposal complicates and prolongs the process 
he also said the walesa proposal indicated the solidarity 
leaders negative attitude toward any form of coalition government 
had eased creating new chances for the grand coalition 
which he and the communist party have long advocated 
for this reason he said he viewed malinowski as having a chance 
for forming such a coalition government 
mikolaj kozakiewicz speaker of the sejm said he did not know 
what the effect of kiszczaks statement would be but it was a 
proposal looking for another solution 
he said president wojciech jaruzelski must still accept 
kiszczaks resignation and the parliament would still have to vote 
for malinowski 
however aleksander bentkowski the peasant party parliamentary 
caucus leader said he was not sure that malinowski would accept the 
nomination because of the slim chances of successfully forming a 
coalition with solidarity 
bentkowski said solidarity has said repeatedly it wants to lead 
the next coalition so probably would not agree to support 
malinowski 
gen kiszczak in this way is presenting his resignation in 
an elegant manner he is making the president realize that somebody 
else has to do it bentkowski said 
in my opinion the proposition of lech walesa for a 
solidarityled government would be the best thing to do 
solidaritys parliament leader bronislaw geremek had no comment 
walesa was unavailable for comment his motherinlaw said 
malinowski 54 trained as an economist has been leader of the 
peasant party since 1981 and in the previous term of the parliament 
served as speaker of the sejm malinowski was among the prominent 
communist coalition candidates who failed to win election in june 
parliamentary elections 
wujec said the kiszczak announcement came as a surprise walesa 
had traveled to warsaw on sunday in hopes of holding talks with 
malinowski and democratic party leader jerzy jozwiak but returned 
home monday after neither agreed to a meeting 
solidarity sen jaroslaw kaczynski read a brief statement from 
walesa earlier in the day in which he said the offer of a coalition 
with the peasants and democrats stood 
there was no further news on a possible meeting between walesa 
and kiszczak who on saturday appealed for such a meeting the 
solidarity leader said sunday he hoped to meet kiszczak in the 
nearest future 
kaczynski had confirmed sunday that walesa himself was 
considering being prime minister in a solidarityled coalition 
under a political deal reached with the communists before 
partially free elections in june the communists have 37 percent of 
the chamber and solidarity 35 percent thus the peasant party and 
democratic party hold the balance of parliamentary power 
kaczynski began talks with the two minor parties thursday and 
they continued through the weekend at an undisclosed site he said 
peasant party deputies have said voters disliked the choice of 
kiszczak as prime minister the election of jaruzelski as president 
and the selection of former prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski as 
the new head of the communist party 
the reshuffle left the impression among voters that nothing has 
changed despite solidaritys victory at the polls in june when union 
backed candidates swept all 161 seats open to the opposition in the 
460member sejm and 99 of 100 seats in the newly created senate

the soviet union despite two highlevel us 
appeals last week conducted an intercontinental missile test near 
two remote hawaiian islands bush administration officials said 
monday 
the 8000milerange unarmed missile launched from the soviet 
union flew between the two tiny islands necker and nihoa shortly 
before splashing down friday 1250 miles southeast of oahu 
the soviets had announced aug 7 their intention to conduct a 
test sometime between aug 11 and aug 21 neither of the two 
private us appeals to deputy ambassador serge chetverikov nor the 
test itself was made public 
its somewhat disturbing the soviets didnt take our concerns 
into account a us official said monday there was no danger 
but there is always a risk however slight it might be that 
something would go awry that is why we felt it was inappropriate 
assistant secretary of state raymond r seitz and his deputy 
curtis w kamman met last monday and tuesday with chetverikov to 
complain that the missile was likely to pass over the hawaiian 
island chain before splashing down two us officials said 
seitz and kamman are the senior officers in the state 
departments bureau of european and canadian affairs 
the us government expressed its deep concern to the soviets 
over the planned test and asked that it be modified the us 
official said 
chetverikov returned to the state department on wednesday to say 
the test would be conducted strictly over international water 
we did not find that response persuasive or sufficient because 
the soviet missile test would pass over the hawaiian island chain 
said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity it is not 
a legal issue but an issue of political and safety considerations 
once again we strongly urged the soviets to reconsider their 
plans 
in the us appeals to the soviets the planned test was 
described as a provocation said another us official who also 
requested anonymity 
us relations with the soviet union have been on the upswing in 
most areas of the world although there have been recent 
disagreements over us assistance to rebels in afghanistan and 
soviet overtures to iran 
despite the us appeals the soviets tested the missile which 
splashed down shortly after passing over the 600kilometer channel 
between necker and nihoa 
as it turned out the missile did not pass over either island 
the point of the us complaint one official said was that it 
was too close for comfort 
the soviets initial notice had said the targeted spashdown area 
was a circle with a radius of 30 nautical miles about 1200 miles 
south of oahu 
actually one official said the missile touched down about 1250 
miles south of oahu 
in their notice the soviets said another missile test might be 
conducted within the aug 1121 period as well with a spashdown 
target of a rectangle about 1200 miles northwest of the hawaiian 
islands evidently that test was never conducted but the reasons 
why could not be learned 
two years ago in a similar situation the soviets revised a 
missile test near the hawaiian chain when the reagan administration 
objected

a panamanian bank pleaded guilty to 
druglaundering charges monday and the united states canada and 
switzerland will share 5 million in seized drug trafficking profits 
as a result the justice department announced 
this international cooperation in the war against drugs sends a 
message to drug traffickers everywhere that it is going to be harder 
for them to hide their illgotten profits and easier for us to 
recover them attorney general dick thornburgh said 
the department said banco de occidente of panama pleaded guilty 
in us district court in atlanta to aiding colombias medellin 
carter in laundering cocaine proceeds via wire transfers from the 
united states to panama and then to europe 
chief judge william c okelley ordered the bank to forfeit 5 
million in substitute assets to make up for drug profits that had 
been transferred to other accounts 
the department said us agencies will split 3 million of the 
money and 1 million each will go to canada and switzerland 
under legislation enacted in 1986 the united states can seize 
property owned or under the control of narcotics traffickers even 
when the actual drug profits are no longer available for seizure 
moving the assets of illegal drug trafficing out of one bank 
account and into another can no longer cover up the illegal act 
thornburgh said it is like fingerprints that cannot be brushed 
away 
the panamanian bank and the banco de occidente of cali colombia 
were charged as an outgrowth of the operation polar cap 
investigation of the laundering of illegal drug profits 
charges against the colombian bank were dismissed as a result of 
the panamanian banks guilty plea to a twocount indictment the 
department said the colombian bank guaranteed to the united states 
the full payment of the panamanian banks forfeiture 
the government said its evidence showed that the drug proceeds 
were effectively removed from the united states and then passed 
through banco de occidente

the soviet union has invited a 
delegation of family and friends of swedish diplomat raoul 
wallenberg to moscow to discuss his disappearance 44 years ago an 
official said monday 
wallenberg who would be 77 is credited with saving tens of 
thousands of hungarian jews from nazi concentration camps in world 
war ii 
he was arrested by the soviet army when it entered budapest in 
1945 moscow has said he died of natural causes in prison in 1947 
but soviet dissidents claimed to have seen him alive as late as 1986 
the invitation to a fourmember group indicated the soviets might 
release more information about wallenbergs fate said sonja 
sonnenfeld secretary of the wallenberg association 
just to repeat that old information would not be enough to 
invite us she said the soviets must be aware that there should 
be new aspects 
it was the first time soviet officials offered to meet 
wallenbergs family or association officials to discuss the case 
ms sonnenfeld said 
it was not immediately clear when the invitation was issued but 
ms sonnenfeld said the group planned to travel to moscow in 
midoctober 
soviet officials invited wallenbergs halfsister nina lagergren 
and halfbrother guy von dardel ms sonnenfeld and per anger 
wallenbergs assistant at the swedish embassy in budapest she said 
the group was promised meetings with highlevel officials ms 
sonnenfeeld said but no names were mentioned and we didnt 
insist 
wallenberg issued swedish travel documents to 20000 hungarian 
jews who were slated for nazi concentration camps his intervention 
with german authorities was credited with the survival of another 
100000 jews from the countrys prewar community of 750000 
the soviets never explained why wallenberg was arrested some 
historians believe he was mistaken for an american spy

pw botha resigned as 
president monday after leading south africa through 11 years of 
racial and political upheaval and finally losing a bitter power 
struggle within his national party 
botha whose power base began eroding after a stroke jan 18 
said cabinet ministers forced him out and told him he could use his 
health as an excuse 
to this i replied i am not prepared to leave on a lie 
botha 73 said in a nationally televised speech 
after all these years of my best efforts for the national 
party and for the government of this country as well as the 
security of our country i am being ignored by ministers serving in 
my cabinet botha said 
i have decided to submit my resignation to the chief 
justice today with effect aug 15 
botha showed no emotion as he read the 20minute speech seated 
at his desk in his official residence in cape town he showed no 
signs of effects of the stroke 
botha previously had agreed under pressure from party leaders 
to retire after the sept 6 parliamentary elections but he 
repeatedly provoked confrontations with the party and refused to 
cooperate with younger leaders forcing a showdown 
fw de klerk 53 who succeeded botha as national party leader 
in february will be named tuesday to serve as acting president 
until the elections the foreign ministry said 
botha began south africas first halting steps of race reform in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s and liked to depict himself as the 
first south african leader to pursue racial reform but he always 
defended the apartheid policies that deny the black majority a voice 
in national affairs 
his reform efforts slowed following nationwide black unrest in 
1984 which erupted after botha helped push through a constitution 
that brought asians and people of mixedrace into the previously 
allwhite parliament but in separate chambersthe constitution 
continued to exclude the black majority 
the new constitution also gave botha almost unlimited governing 
power which he used to declare a national emergency that has 
stifled the political violence 
the banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition said the leadership change would make 
little difference to south africas 28 million blacks 
de klerk was party to the disasterous policies of the 
government under pw bothas rule the front said in a statement 
the mass democratic movement demands the government as a whole 
resigns so that democracy and peace may be established once and for 
all 
de klerk a lawyer who appeared to agree with botha on most major 
policy issues has spoken in vague terms of speeding up the pace of 
race reform 
however he has not promised specific changes on major apartheid 
issues such as powersharing with the black majority or 
desegregating schools and neighborhoods 
many whites have seen de klerk as representing a new more 
conciliatory generation of national party leaders they welcomed the 
vision of a nation in which as he put it all reasonable people 
align themselves behind mutually acceptable goals 
helen suzman an antiapartheid pioneer in parliament said of 
him people are being too optimistic if they think he is going to 
throw fundamental policy overboard but i think hes pragmatic and 
intelligent he realizes that change is absolutely inevitable 
de klerk said bothas decision to retire was in the best 
interest of south africa 
we are sad that a man who has done so much for his country has 
to retire under these unhappy circumstances de klerk said in a 
televised interview after bothas speech 
the battle between botha and the national party turned into a 
public showdown when botha charged friday he had not been consulted 
about de klerks planned aug 28 meeting with zambian president 
kenneth kaunda 
foreign minister rf botha who is not related to the outgoing 
president had issued a statement thursday evening saying botha was 
informed of the trip 
the diplomatic mission could bolster south africas longstrained 
relations with black africa as president botha had worked hard to 
increase south african contact with the rest of the continent 
however botha said it was inopportune to meet with president 
kaunda at this stage because the african national congress 
guerrilla movement is based in zambia the anc is the largest 
guerrilla group fighting the south african government 
president kaundas action is aimed at promoting the ancs 
image botha said 
bothas statements are likely to damage the national party in the 
september elections particularly among conservative whites who 
generally see the anc as a terrorist organization 
botha in one of his rare public comments in recent months 
insisted he was not a sulky old man 
but he never congratulated de klerk who had been the education 
minister on becoming national party leader last month botha 
refused to attend a farewell banquet planned for him by the national 
party which he served 54 years

two palestinians hurled 
firebombs at a car carrying israeli tax collectors monday and 
seriously burned two people in the car the army said 
two men in the front seat suffered burns over 40 percent to 60 
percent of their bodies said ruth meckel spokesman for hadassah 
hospital in jerusalem a man and a woman in the back seat were 
slightly injured 
israel radio said the radical moslem group islamic jihad group 
claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement issued in 
amman jordan the group has no known relation to kidnappers in 
lebanon who use the same name 
soldiers clamped a curfew on the area of ramallah where the 
attack occurred and israel radio said about 40 palestinians were 
detained 
soldiers also welded shut the doors of about 10 neighborhood 
shops a common punishment 
there have been repeated confrontations between israeli 
authorities and palestinians over nonpayment of taxes underground 
leaders of the antiisraeli uprising in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip have urged palestians to withhold taxes to undercut 
israels economy 
in the past the government has seized palestinians identity 
papers to force payment of taxes 
in the west bank city of nablus masked youths set ablaze a bus 
carrying arab workers to jobs in israel arab reporters said no one 
was injured because the youths ordered the driver and passengers off 
the bus before setting it afire 
preventing palestinians from working in israel also is a tactic 
of the uprising leaders 
the moslem fundamentalist movement hamas or zeal claimed 
responsibility for the bus burning in slogans painted on walls in 
black and green paint 
at least 536 palestinians have been killed in clashes with 
soldiers or israeli civilians since the uprising began in december 
1987 thirtyeight israelis have been slain 
rightwing and jewish settler leaders said monday a leading 
rabbis declaration that jewish law could permit trading occupied 
land for peace is dangerous and may lead to the bloodshed of our 
homeland 
the statement by rabbi ovadia yosef on sunday night drew the 
strongest ire from the gush emunim settler movement which believes 
jews must retain the west bank and gaza strip for religious reasons 
israel seized the land from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle 
east war 
its a shame that a great man of israel did damage to the 
nation of israel especially now when we need to be united said 
gush emunim spokesman noam arnon 
yosef spiritual mentor of the ultraorthodox shas party is 
considered one of the greatest experts on halacha or jewish law 
rightwing legislator geula cohen whose tehiya party advocates 
annexing the west bank and gaza strip said yosef was opening the 
way for israels enemies to gain territory 
he is calling on our enemies to threaten us with war she 
said he is responsible for this the bloodshed of our homeland 
not only our people 
yosef told 1000 orthodox jews that the government could return 
occupied land if it saved jewish lives and avoided war 
israeli newspapers sunday reported that yosef a former chief 
rabbi has received death threats from extremists since his 
statement 
in tunisia on monday us ambassador robert h pelletreau jr 
met for three hours with a palestine liberation organization 
delegation in the fourth formal session since the usplo dialogue 
opened last year 
the dialogue began after the plo renounced violence and 
recognized israels right to exist 
pelletreau said the meeting in a suburb of tunis was held at the 
request of the united states no details were released 
the palestinian delegation was led by yasser abdrabboo a member 
of the plo executive committee who said the discussions would 
continue in the near future

new research indicates that nicotine 
impairs rather than stimulates brain cells contrary to earlier 
belief and may explain the drugs calming effect a pharmacologist 
reported monday 
linda wong of the university of texasgalveston said that 
nicotine a substance found in tobacco suppresses rat brain cells 
that control basic behaviors such as learning memory and emotion 
wongs conclusions presented at the 40th annual meeting of the 
american society for pharmacology and experimental therapeutics 
contradict the traditional scientific belief that nicotine 
stimulates brain cells 
scientists have believed for years that the drug excites some 
neurons which in turn inhibit other brain functions to induce a 
calming effect on smokers neurons are nerve cells 
wong said her studies on rats suggest that nicotine directly 
reduces neuron activity in people 
being as it is an inhibiting response it may be implicated in 
anxiety relief she said in an interview 
wong who is to receive her doctorate in september said her 
findings were based on a twoyear study in which nicotine was 
applied to tissue removed from the brains of rats 
she said the tissue was from a small area at the base of the 
brain that integrates learning memory and emotions the nicotine 
either was applied directly or included in a simulated spinal fluid 
absorbed by the tissue 
wong said she and her supervisor pharmacology professor joel p 
gallagher originally sought to learn the mechanisms controlling a 
neuron receptor linked to theta rhythm an electrical current 
produced by the brain 
it was by chance they noticed that nicotine restrained neural 
activity 
it was startling and surprising and we pursued it with all 
gusto she said that really triggered our interest 
they found that nicotine makes it more difficult for neurons to 
fire signals to other neurons because the drug causes the affected 
neuron to release potassium which plays a critical role in the 
transmission of nervous impulses 
wong declined to say that she was certain the same effect would 
be duplicated in people who consume nicotine but said that appeared 
to be the case 
the rat is so well used as a model system it may well provide 
a good model for human cell response she said 
such studies may also provide information about diseases linked 
to neuron firing such as alzheimers wong said she said nicotine 
affects a neural receptor that appears to be a factor associated 
with the degenerative disease 
alzheimers patients generally have fewer of the nicotinic 
receptors than those without the disease wong said that by better 
understanding how the nicotinic receptors behave scientists may 
learn how alzheimers impairs such functions as memory 
wong said a paper describing her research was being considered 
for publication by a national scientific publiction she declined to 
identify 
wong has accepted a research position at childrens hospital in 
boston where she will focus on nicotines effect on the size of 
electrical signals between brain cell molecules

mine workers began on monday an indefinite 
strike for higher wages and nationwide collective bargaining 
cutting this impoverished nation from its principal source of income 
reports from the central andes mining regions indicated most of 
the countrys 80000 miners joined in the strike and many pits were 
closed 
the communistled national federation ofmine workers called the 
strike with nationwide collective bargaining a major issue 
currently each company neogotiates with its own workers and there 
is a wide variation in wage scale 
jorge quesada the unions secretarygeneral said 75000 miners 
were participating in the strike 
he said that 27 miners including nine union leaders were 
detained monday by army troops at mines near la oroya 100 miles 
east of lima 
since last year the la oroya area has been under a state of 
emergency as part of the measures to fight perus leftist guerrillas 
on sunday the army imposed a 9 pm to 5 am curfew in the 
mining region in anticipation of strikerelated violence 
miners went on strike twice last year and stayed away from their 
jobs for a total of three months over the issue of collective 
bargaining 
the mineowners association has said the strikes cost peru 497 
million in lost production and exports mining exports which were 
12 billion last year account for more than half the countrys 
sales abroad 
the union also is seeking a minimum wage of about 500 monthly 
for all miners regardless of employer large mines pay between 5 
and 12 a day while small and mediumsized mines pay between 2 and 
6 a day according to union figures 
a spokesman for the usowned southern peru copper corp perus

irans attempt to buy poisonproducing 
fungi in the netherlands in february was its second try in a year a 
spokesman for a dutch research agency said monday 
an iranian organization approached the central bureau for fungus 
cultures last year about several types of fungus that can be used to 
produce mycotoxin a substance commonly called yellow rain said 
spokesman huub van der aa mycotoxins can be fatal in sufficient 
quantities 
the iranian research organization for science and technology in 
tehran made similar request in february van der aa said on sunday 
the new york times reported that iran also tried to acquire the 
fungi in canada 
we refused to provide the fungi last year because the iranians 
were unable to clarify what they needed the stuff for van der aa 
told the associated press in a telephone interview from this dutch 
town 18 miles east of amsterdam he said he did not remember exactly 
when the first request arrived 
his agency a branch of the netherlands royal academy of 
sciences was advised by the foreign ministry this year of an 
anticipated request and its possible purpose van der aa said the 
academy is an independent institution partly financed with 
government funds 
a foreign ministry spokeswoman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said monday we heard reports in an informal 
circuit of likeminded nations that regularly discuss the global 
flow of fungi and bacteria for commercial and scientific purposes 
she said the informal group was made up several nations within 
the oecd area the organization for economic cooperation and 
development has 24 members including all nato nations japan and

the losses this time were small however mostly just over a 
percentage point while the gains among others also were small 
generally about 2 percent 
overall canadian church membership also grew slightly from 155 
million to 158 million 
the yearbook also shows a steep rise in the proportion of women 
clergy with 79 percent of ministers now women in denominations 
which ordain women 
thats up from 4 percent or nearly double from 10 years earlier 
the total count of ordained women 20730 also is nearly

four armed kidnappers who freed three 
hostages and escaped to paraguay in a plane provided by authorities 
flew back to brazil monday after a gunbattle with paraguayan police 
officials reported monday 
they said the plane carrying the kidnappers identified as two 
married couples landed on a farm in toledo in southern brazil and 
the four stole a truck and drove south toward the paraguayan border 
about 50 miles away 
the fugitives who last week obtained a 42000 ransom in 
exchange for a 9yearold boy they had kidnapped briefly took a 
farmworker hostage after landing in toledo but released him before 
fleeing local police spokesman eduardo silva said 
he said police had spotted and surrounded the truck near the 
paraguayan border 
earlier brazilian police said they thought the plane had flown 
north to bolivia after the shootout with paraguayan police 
in brasilia the capital federal police spokesman paulo marra 
said the pilot and copilot of the twinengine cessna aircraft were 
released when the plane landed in toldeo and were questioned by 
officials there 
the two had volunteered to fly the fugitives from the town of 
presidente prudente in southern brazil to a destination of the 
groups choice they flew south to paraguay where the bands leader 
reportedly owns a farm 
but the plane was refused permission to land at a clandestine 
airstrip near hernandarias about 20 miles over the border the four 
armed with hand grenades submachine guns pistols and shotguns 
exchanged gunfire with paraguayan authorities marra said 
the paraguayan government did not authorize the plane to land 
in its territory marra said there was an exchange of gunfire 
and the copilot was shot in the right forearm 
in an interview with globo television the pilot aniceto de 
oliveira gomes said when we landed in paraguay we were met by 
gunfire i thought i was seeing a film about vietnam 
the paraguayan embassy in brasilia confirmed the plane had landed 
near hernandarias and that it was surrounded by police but denied 
there was a shootout 
the drama that took police on a tenday car chase through three 
brazilian states began aug 3 when 9yearold said agel filho was 
abducted in front of his home in central goiania 135 miles 
southwest of brasilia the capital 
six days later police traced a phone call from the kidnappers to 
the boys family and surrounded a house on the citys outskirts the 
kidnappers negotiated the ransom and an armored car to escape 
three adults including two television news reporters then 
offered to exchange places with the boy and the kidnappers accepted 
the group later released one of the reporters and headed for the 
goiania airport with the driver as the third hostage 
but authorities there refused to give them a plane and pilot and 
the kidnappers then set off on a 500mile trip through the states of 
goias minas gerais and sao paulo 
the hostages were released unharmed sunday after authorities in 
presidente prudente provided the kidnappers with a plane and the 
pilot oliveira gomes a rancher and a local mayor the copilot was 
identified as antonio seregatti 
brazilian police lost track of the plane soon ater it took off 
late sunday afternoon because it was flying at an extremely low 
altitude

monday he has agreed to succeed andre previn as music director of 
the los angeles philharmonic

managing director ernest fleischmann said the appointment is 
sending a signal to the world that we mean business about the 
orchestras future 
salonen will be the 11th conductor in the orchestras 70year 
history he accepted the position he said because its a great 
orchestra and the artistic potential involved is enormous 
he said he felt he already had developed good rapport with its

scientists at europes new particle accelerator 
the worlds biggest said monday they have produced the first 
specimens of a kind of particle from which they expect to gain clues 
to the basic forces of nature 
the successful start of the atom smasher the large 
electronpositron collider paves the way for ensuring europes 
position at the forefront of particle physics research throughout 
the next decade the european laboratory for particle physics said 
in a statement 
scientists shooting beams of particles electrons and positrons 
around the 17mile circular tunnel under the swissfrench border 
reporded the lep produced its first socalled z particle sunday 
said the lab known by its former french acronym cern 
a month after its first test run leps giant detectors more 
than 5000 magnets and other parts have proven to be working and 
ready to produce results cern said 
by the fall lep is expected to produce thousands of zs daily 
creating a greater scope for detailed study than its innovative but 
less prolific us competitor the stanford linear accelerator at 
menlo park calif according to the statement 
lep built over eight years with 13 billion swiss francs 790 
million from cerns 14 members states is the most powerful 
particle accelerator and the largest scientific instrument ever 
made according to cern 
it said the machine will recreate with new sophistication the 
dense swirl of matter just after the big bang the explosion 
scientists believe created the universe 15 billion years ago 
z particles existed naturally only for an instant after the big 
bang by watching them decay into other particles cern scientists 
hope to get new insight into the structure of matter and the 
development of the universe 
in particular results of the z experiments are expected to help 
complete a scientific model explaining the interaction of natures 
postulated four basic forces gravity electromagnetism and the 
weak and strong forces 
carlo rubbia the italian physics professor who heads cern 
shared the 1984 physics nobel prize with dutch scientist simon van 
der meer for discovering the z at cern but stronger colliders were 
needed to make enough so scientists can draw wellfounded 
conclusions from the random ways the particle breaks down 
one of the most fascinating results may be the discovery of an as 
yet theoretical particle believed to be the key to mass why things 
weight what they do

for memorializing the texas democrats work 
while workers were struggling to recover the bodies of leland and 
15 others who died when their plane crashed in a rugged area of

offer it showed our compassion our generosity our interest in 
seeing that there are no more hungry people the children would not 
die of hunger 
we ask god why these said mallett an aide to sen lloyd

about the condition of the world they went about doing good to 
heal the world

children in ethiopia anywhere in the world in that way we will 
know that in your dying you have challenged us to live

alleviation of hunger and suffering here and in africa and elsewhere 
in the world 
foley said lelands willingness to return to africa time after 
time despite unstable political conditions and the risks of travel 
was a testament to his determination individually to follow 
through on commitments and values that were very very close to him 
and i think other members will also be willing to assume those 
risks and i dont think this will change said foley 
letters telegrams and phone calls of condolence continued to 
pour into lelands office monday as staff members from other 
congressional offices pitched in to help

worked closely with many political and religious leaders in dallas 
trying to solve statewide problems 
he was like family to our elected officials here wright said 
meanwhile hunger organizations that worked with leland were 
beginning to come forward with ideas for memorializing his work 
one of them rev larry jones whose feed the children ministry 
takes in about 40 million a year for international hunger projects

president jose azcona hoyo said 
monday that moves toward democracy by nicaraguas sandinista 
government allowed him to vote for disbanding that countrys 
usbacked contra rebels 
the hondurasbased guerrillas should understand that the 
military option against nicaragua was canceled in the tela 
meetings azcona said in reference to the central american summit 
in the honduran port city last week 
an accord which was put together by honduras and approved by the 
five central american presidents calls for the rebels to be 
repatriated in 120 days 
azconas position is central to the accords success because 
honduras has allowed the socalled contras to operate from its 
territory if honduras abides by the accords the rebels will find 
it difficult to survive 
an agreement between the nicaraguan government and its political 
opponents shortly before the tela summit weighed heavily in the 
decision to approve the plan demobilizing the rebels azcona said 
nicaragua undoubtedly is experiencing a democratic opening 
under the agreement nicaraguan president daniel ortega promised 
fair elections in february and to end the draft ortega has also 
granted an amnesty to all nicaraguan rebels living in honduras and 
nicaragua 
the united states which since last year has given only 
humanitarian aid to the contras has said it will abide by the tela 
accord 
but in miami a contra leader reiterated that the rebels will not 
lay down their weapons rebel leader enrique bermudez called for 
nicaraguan citizens to provide the rebels with aid 
we call on peasants and workers in nicaragua to support the 
freedom fighters with food and clothes to maintain the struggle 
against the sandinista regime 
the peace accord calls for the united nations and organization of 
american states to set up a verification commission within 30 days 
to plan and monitor repatriation of the 11000 contras and 12000 
dependents living in honduras the contras have fought the 
nicaraguan government since 1981 saying the sandinistas betrayed 
the ideals of the revolution that overthrew anastasio somoza in july 
1979 
the sandinistas and the contras agreed march 21 to suspend 
offensive operations but talks aimed at a permanent end to the 
7yearold war in which 50000 people have died stand at an impasse

a mental patient accused of fatally 
stabbing a 9yearold girl at a street fair after walking away from 
a state hospital was found competent monday to stand trial 
superior court judge donald t dorsey accepted the unananimous 
finding of competency by an examining panel made up of a 
psychiatrist psychologist and psychiatric social worker 
the panel noted that david peterson suffers from mental illness 
and experiences delusions of persecution but said the problems do 
not compromise his ability to understand the charges against him and 
to help in his own defense

after being found innocent by reason of insanity in the stabbing of 
a neighbor in a rooming house

attorney assistant public defender chris james said he believed 
peterson had suffered the injury when he was arrested after the july 
28 knife attack 
asked how peterson has been acting since the slaying james would 
only say hes a very sick young man 
james waived a hearing on the competency issue but said he would 
request that peterson be reexamined before trial because competency 
is a day today thing 
the judge scheduled a probable cause hearing for sept 12 
peterson was arrested on murder and weapons charges 
peterson walked off the grounds of connecticut valley hospital in 
middletown on july 28 took a bus to downtown and bought a hunting 
knife he then went to a crowded street fair where he attacked

and a bystander pulled peterson away from the girl she was stabbed 
repeatedly in the face and chest and died less than an hour later

prosecutors on monday dropped 12yearold rape and 
kidnapping charges against gary dotson 10 years after he was 
convicted on testimony later recanted by his accuser 
prosecutors took the action which clears dotson of any legal 
wrongdoing in the case immediately after a defense motion for a new 
trial was granted by circuit judge thomas r fitzgerald 
attorney thomas breen saying hightech genetic tests prove 
dotsons innocence had asked fitzgerald for a new trial 
the only conclusion that can be drawn is that gary dotson was 
convicted of a crime that never took place breen said outside the 
courtroom 
prosecutors had contended that the test results were not enough 
to clear dotson and that a new trial couldnt be granted unless it 
was likely to reverse the outcome of the first one 
i have my bitterness yes its been hard to deal with said 
dotson convicted of rape and aggravated kidnapping in 1979 and 
sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison for a 1977 attack on cathleen 
crowell webb 
six years later mrs webb recanted her testimony a move that 
led to clemency for dotson 
i forgave her a long time ago ive no animosity against her 
dotson said 
im sure shes very relieved that its done the rev carl 
nannini a dublin nh baptist minister who acts as mrs webbs 
spokesman said in an interview 
although nannini said mrs webb had not known about mondays 
action when he talked to her earlier in the day the minister said 
mrs webb has contacts in chicago who have kept her current on 
developments in the case 
breen contended that genetic test results prove that semen found 
on the underpants worn by mrs webb on the night she said she was 
raped in july 1977 did not come from dotson 
in august 1988 edward blake of forensic science associates in 
richmond calif examined the underwear and concluded dotson 
couldnt have been among the 5 percent of men whose genetic pattern 
matched cells found in the stain a finding supported by a british 
expert at the university of leicester 
the stain was a key piece of evidence in the prosecutions case 
when she recanted her testimony in 1985 mrs webb now a 
harrisville nh homemaker said she invented the attack because 
she feared she had become pregnant by her boyfriend 
gov james r thompson granted dotson clemency that year saying 
his punishment had been sufficient but the governor has refused to 
pardon dotson saying he did not believe mrs webbs reversal 
when thompson heard the court news monday he was happy that 
the whole thing is over said david fields a spokesman for the 
governor 
he was frustrated that he gave mr dotson repeated 
opportunities and something always happened fields said 
dotson 32 who has married and become a father since his 
release was paroled last august after recurring minor problems with 
the law returned him to prison he has been living in an alcohol and 
drug treatment center under terms of his parole

two bombs one in 
londonderry and the other in belfast exploded late monday amid 
scattered rioting marking 20 years since british troops arrived in 
northern ireland 
police issued a statement saying the londonderry bomb was thrown 
at an armored police land rover and the blast rocked the vehicle and 
broke windows in nearby homes but injured no one 
the belfast bomb also apparently aimed at security forces 
exploded in the roman catholic ardoyne district according to 
police they gave no details 
in sporadic rioting ira supporters threw rocks and gasoline 
bombs at police who responded with plastic bullets police said two 
demonstrators were injured but that their conditions were not 
serious 
earlier marchers paraded through downtown londonderry chanting 
ira ira as they passed police patrols and the ruins of a bar 
destroyed two days earlier by an irish republican army bomb 
during the day in belfast police fired plastic bullets to 
disperse youths who set fire to at least four vehicles in scattered 
violence police said there were no injuries 
in this northern city where the troubles began several 
thousand people joined the march from creggan a catholic district 
down through the bogside the catholic area where fighting with 
police prompted the dispatch of british troops on aug 14 1969 
marchers went down the hill to the free derry corner at the 
edge of the bogside with its sign saying you are now entering 
free derry 
the pub was left in ruins by a bomb that exploded four hours 
before the huge annual protestant march saturday commemorating the 
end of the catholic siege of derry 300 years ago no one was injured 
central londonderry was sealed off monday after police noticed 
two suspicious beer barrels but reopened after midday when it was 
concluded to be a hoax 
armored military land rovers blocked streets that were closed to 
the march 
the rally after the parade illustrated divisions within northern 
irelands catholic minority only one speaker mentioned the rev ian 
paisley the protestant militant but four denounced john hume 
leader of the largest catholic political party 
weve all risked our lives for 20 years and i say fight on 
said martin mcguinness vice president of sinn fein the legal 
political wing of the outlawed ira 
bernadette devlin mcaliskey a protest leader in the 1960s and 
70s urged continued organizing toward unification of ireland as a 
32county workers republic 
she said she wanted democracy equality and the right to say what 
she thought without fear and nobody can give them to me as a 
present in a wee box john hume cant negotiate them 
it was a quiet and orderly crowd of 5000 to 6000 after the 
speeches there was a large bonfire of scrap wood discarded 
furniture and tires 
opponents of the marchers within the catholic community stayed 
home 
the division among irish nationalists has been as persistent and 
difficult to heal as the protestantcatholic split at the root of 
the years of violence 
both the social democratic and labor party and sinn fein advocate 
a united ireland but sinn fein backs the iras violent campaign 
against british rule of the province the sdlp advocates peaceful 
change saying more innocent civilians have been killed by the ira 
than by security forces 
londonderry was a focus of catholic civil rights marches a 
generation ago protestants were a majority in the province but a 
minority in londonderry and resorted to gerrymandering and job and 
housing discrimination there to keep control 
it is revered by protestants as the town where their ancestors 
withstood a catholicled siege in 1689 their annual commemorative 
parade sparked the violence in 1969 
history shows that oppression gives rise to resistance the 
only way to end the violence is to end the injustice mcguinness 
wrote in a 20th anniversary edition of the derry journal newspaper 
the use of armed struggle for the ira supported by a large 
section of the nationalist community is as natural as the use of 
violence by the defenders of the bogside 20 years ago 
hume the catholic political leader said the ira has caused many 
of the provinces troubles 
we have emergency legislation we have troops on our streets 
we have young people being continually stopped and searched we have 
house searches we have checkpoints we have prisons full of young 
people he wrote in the derry journal 
every man and woman in the street knows one simple way to end 
those problems if the ira ended their physical force campaign 
tomorrow and devoted themselves to peaceful means alone then in a 
matter of weeks the troops would be gone from streets 
hume has defeated mcguinness twice in parliamentary elections in 
1987 the vote was 23743 to 8707 
more than 2740 people twothirds of them civilians have been 
killed in northern ireland since 1969 and dozens have died in 
attacks in britain the irish republic and continental europe

british and argentine officials are holding 
talks this week on restoring diplomatic and trade relations for the 
first time since the 1982 falklands war authorities said monday 
argentinas willingness to temporarily set aside its claim over 
the falkland islands led to the diplomatic breakthrough officials 
said speaking with the condition of anonymity 
none of the officials involved would provide details of the talks 
under way in new york 
but one diplomat said we cannot deny that the situation is very 
dynamic and something could happen in the next few days or weeks 
diplomatic relations were severed in april 1982 when argentina 
invaded and occupied the falkland islands a british colony since 
1833 british forces recaptured the islands off argentinas southern 
coast in a 74day war 
argentines call the islands the malvinas and claim they inherited 
them in 1810 after declaring independence from spain 
argentina never formally declared an end to hostilities in the 
falklands war it has refused to allow british planes or ships to 
use argentine ports or to allow british companies to bid on 
argentine public projects 
argentina also banned british products from its markets but 
lifted restrictions earlier this month britain earlier removed a 
similar ban on argentine imports 
britain has said it wants to normalize trade relations with 
argentina negotiate a fishing agreement reestablish air links and 
reduce tension 
argentinas new president carlos menem took the first step 
toward restoring ties shortly after his inauguration in early july 
previously argentina had said talks would have to start with the 
sovereignty issue 
menems government would like to recover fishing rights in the 
area around the falklands britain currently enforces a 150mile 
exclusion zone around the islands

itself mccoy said last week in an interview in federal prison in 
ashland ky

uniform sentencing guidelines established in 1987

them through legal services work he began after serving two years in

after me the honorable judge haden has not afforded me the first 
iota of justice mccoy said 
mccoy was convicted in june of the bank robbery the subsequent 
murder of accomplice russell davis two conspiracy counts and the 
threatening of federal witnesses 
davis sister angie dobson traveled from her home in pensacola

echoes of the woodstock festival reverberate in 
american society 20 years after the counterculture concert rocked 
the nation but when it comes to rock n roll itself most people 
say the tunes gone flat 
eight in 10 american adults have heard of the woodstock 
festival held aug 1517 1969 on a muddy farm in upstate new 
york and three in 10 of them wish they had attended a media 
generalassociated press poll has found 
that high level of awareness was rooted in a view of woodstock 
as more of a historical milestone than simply a show most regard 
it as the expression of a social movement and half of them said 
that movement continues today 
yet the view of woodstock was not an idealized one while nearly 
six in 10 of those who knew of the festival said it has had a 
lasting effect on american society only half of them said the 
effect was a positive one

a total lunar eclipse will occur after sunset 
in five continents on wednesday when the full moon orbits into the 
shadow of the earth and slowly turns from a bright silver into a 
copper or orange disk 
more than a billion people in the western hemisphere will have a 
chance to watch as the moon appears to be slowly nibbled away 
changing from the normal bright reflected light of a full moon into 
the colorful glow of eclipse 
the celestial show starts at 823 pm edt over the united 
states and will end about 5 hours later the eastern united states 
will get the best viewing and alaska will miss the eclipse 
altogether 
visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and western 
parts of the country because of the difference in sunset and 
moonrise in los angeles for instance the eclipse will have 
started before the sun has set or the moon has risen by the time 
the sky has darkened completely in california the moon will 
already be in the deepest part of its eclipse for seattle the 
moon will still be below the horizon at mideclipse but will rise 
during the totality phase

postal workers who tested positive for drug 
use were more prone to absenteeism and getting fired according to 
a new study that could give private employers an indication of the 
cost of workers drug use 
the analysis one of the first studies of its kind found that 
drug users had a 41 percent higher absence rate and about a 40 
percent higher rate of being fired said researcher jacques normand 
results suggest that by spending about 18 million a year to 
screen job applicants for drugs the post office could avoid about 
31 million in costs related to absenteeism and firing in the 
first year he said over three years the avoided costs would 
surpass 17 million he said 
for private employers the study provides hard data showing that 
drug screening results are related to later job performance he 
said

linford schultz and four companions 
are taking a walk 30000 miles across the world they figure 
itll take them about four years 
theyve been under way since may starting out from georgetown 
guyana home of their continenttocontinent adventure club 
weve had a bit of activity said lawrence renville the 
27yearold second in command after schultz and the walks chief 
diarist 
the purpose is manifold to commemorate the 500th anniversary in 
1992 of christopher columbus discovery of the new world the 400th 
anniversary of the arrival of african slaves in the western 
hemisphere and the 23rd anniversary of the independence of guyana 
their homeland 
their route will take them across the northern tip of south 
america through central america and mexico across texas and the 
gulf states and up the east coast to halifax nova scotia in 
canada from there the group will cross the atlantic by ship to 
ireland and cross europe to greece theyll sail across the 
mediterannean to the middle east and walk to pakistan and india 
then it will be by boat across the indian ocean to africa 
their goal to reach is goree island near dakar senegal in 
northwest africa by 1992 the anniversary of columbus discovery of 
america 
but goree was the transhipment point for most of the slave trade 
that reached what now is guyana formerly british guiana on the 
northern shoulder of south america 
we might stay awhile and do some exploring before we come 
home said the 48yearold schultz explaining why the group 
might not be back to guyana until 1993 
long walks are not new to schultz he walked from central 
america to new york city in 1968 but for others in his group the 
four years away from loved ones was not an easy choice 
my girlfriend was sad but theres some things a mans got to 
do said 24yearold gerald gonsalves 
the walking party already has had a brush with trouble 
after setting out from georgetown on may 26 the 23rd 
anniversary of guyanas independence the group hiked 300 miles to 
the town of wauna on the venezuelan border there they arranged 
with warao indians to use two shallow canoes to paddle up the 
cuyubini river to curiapa at the mouth of te orinoco river in 
venezuela 
but the canoe in schultzs command capsized in the wake of a 
passing motorboat pitching the occupants into the 
crocodileinfested river and sending some 2000 worth of 
photographic and camping equipment to the bottom 
the group continued on however and made it to caracas where 
they have started a fundraising effort to finance the next leg of 
the trip up central america to the united states 
weve attracted some interest from private individuals and 
charitable organizations said renville a former insurance 
salesman who said he had to quit his job because his boss refused 
to give him four years off 
the ymca in caracas is providing the group accommodations in 
exchange for voluntary work such as talking about their 
experiences with schoolchildren and cleaning up the grounds 
by the time we reach the states we hope to have a camper 
schultz said 
the idea is to send the camper ahead with the groups equipment 
while they hike during the day with local organizations promoting 
friendship and motivating others to seek adventure 
in the past there was a great demand for adventure said 
schultz in fact it was the basis for settling the new world 
today we have trips to the moon but what we are doing is exploring 
the minds of our neighbors this is the most exciting thing we can 
do 
the group was assembled from the different ethnic groups that 
make up society guyana white black asian amerindian and 
mulatto 
the other two in the group are compton ferguson 48 a former 
merchant seaman and troy dasraph 24 
schultz and ferguson started out together for the walk to new 
york in 1968 but ferguson dropped out after going part of the way 
schultz wrote a book continent to continent about that walk 
we didnt see each other for 18 years schultz said of 
ferguson now we are back on the road with these new guys they 
are green but someday they will be able to look back with pride on 
the journey 
schultz added when you embark on a mission like this its 
always like finding your way in the dark but there are always 
helping hands out there that make it worthwhile but we have to be 
careful in some countries in latin america where the political 
situation is dangerous 
the group plans on crossing into the united states sometime in 
the late fall and wintering over before continuing up the east 
coast to canada and on into europe 
once back home in guyana the group plans to write a book

hes still entitled to any sturgeon caught off 
london bridge and the password to the tower but gone are the days 
when londons lord mayors roused the rabble and played banker to 
the king 
celebrating the 800th anniversary of his office this year 
todays lord mayor christopher collett stays well away from 
politics in ruling his nowtiny domain called the city at the 
heart of ancient london 
yet while bereft of his predecessors powers the lord mayor is 
not an empty figurehead as representative of the city of london 
the onesquare mile financial district the mayor is an ambassador 
for big business and like the monarch a symbol of the history 
britons cherish 
people even britons think the lord mayor is like ed koch or 
jacques chirac said tony travers head of a london school of 
economics research group on capital government speaking of the 
mayors of new york and paris the contrast could not be greater 
londons only mayor the rest of the city has none does all 
the things that a marketing department might do travers said 
certainly the emphasis has changed lord mayor collett said 
from under a threecornered hat in a spare moment at a public 
appearance were now left as the titular head 
like all the 660 mayors before him collett an accountant is a 
wealthy man with ties to business mayors are nominated by members 
of the citys ancient trade guilds and elected by aldermen they 
serve for a year 
early mayors often used their wealth to lend money to the crown 
or pay court expenses and received in return favors ranging from 
tax exemptions to gifts of royal venison 
merchant henry fitzailwyn the first lord mayor was also the 
longest serving with 20 years in office 
lord mayors had to pay expenses so weighty that men often chose 
to pay fines rather than serve and in 1554 a law was passed 
allowing mayors to cut down the number of courses served at their 
feasts modern mayors still subsidize their terms although they 
receive entertainment allowances 
yet ample money did not always ensure good relations with the 
crown writes valerie hope author of my lord mayor a history 
of the office published this year 
thomas fitzthomas one of the early rabble rousers landed in 
prison for heading a rebellion against city aristocrats many of 
his successors particularly in the 18th century were radicals 
some siding with the american colonists against george iii 
most famous was john wilkes whose criticism of george iii 
brought him a prison sentence which a mob tried to prevent 
another brackley kennett was sentenced for exacerbating an 
anticatholic riot in 1780 
by this time the mayor wore quite a few hats 
he arbitrated disputes between citizens or merchants could 
dispatch people to prison and sat as a justice city archivist 
jim sewell said in an interview he might have gone round to the 
market and told poulterers off if they were overpricing or seized 
fishing nets banned in the river thames 
the lord mayor is still the citys chief magistrate and can 
preside at his official residence mansion house in the justice 
room 
a whirlwind of treeplantings business promotions lunches 
meetings and trips sometimes abroad also occupies todays mayor 
who wears a medievallooking costume of lacy shirt flowing robe 
and gold chain 
his closest brushes with politics are hosting annual banquets 
where the prime minister and head of the treasury make major 
speeches and presiding over meetings of the common council the 
citys administrative body 
added to colletts duties this year have been anniversary 
celebrations from cutting a sevenfoothigh birthday cake to an 
extra special lord mayors show the mayors popular election 
parade 
dame mary donaldson the only woman to hold the post says she 
gave 600 speeches and worked 17hour days during her year in office 
in 1983 
you do have to submerge to a certain extent your own 
personality said the perky dame mary a member of the 
worshipful company of gardeners guild any thought of having 
a personal life is just out 
periodic efforts have been made to reform the city which is 
criticized as anachronistic with its medievalera boundaries and 
government dominated by business interests said travers 
but he added i cant imagine the lord mayor being abolished 
its rather like buckingham palace and all those ceremonial 
things

when a medical emergency arises on the set of a 
movie its not always part of the script 
so when dr james dorta is not setting a broken bone at 
baltimores franklin square hospital or patching up a shooting 
victim at georgetown university medical center in washington the 
emergency medicine specialist usually can be found on location 
dorta is the founder of lifestar international a 
washingtonbased medical consulting firm that expands the walls of 
the emergency room to movie sets 
he and his colleagues have provided advance planning and 
emergency medical care on the set for three recent movies 
licence to kill and arnold schwarzeneggers total recall 
both filmed in mexico city and the abyss an underwater 
thriller filmed in an abandoned nuclear power plant that was 
converted into a film studio in gaffney sc 
were like the sprinkler heads in skyscrapers said dorta 
producers with vision can see the necessity of taking preventive 
measures to ensure the safety of their crews its several hundreds 
of millions of dollars of movie budgets that were protecting 
according to the new yorkbased center for safety in the arts 
more than 1000 injuries are reported each year in the us film 
industry and since 1980 at least 19 people have been killed in 
helicopter accidents on movie sets actor vic morrow and two 
children were killed in 1982 during the filming of twilight zone 
the movie and five people died during the filming of chuck 
norris delta force 2 in the philippines last may 
dorta 38 started the company after accompanying his 
producercousin albert cubby broccoli to morocco to film 
another james bond movie the living daylights released by 
united artists in 1987 
it was dortas job to keep the new james bond timothy dalton 
and the rest of the cast and crew in good health while the movie 
was filmed in the oasis of ouarzazate in the sahara desert time 
lost on the set because of injuries or illness cost more than 
250000 per day or about 500 per minute the doctors work also 
took him off the film set and into what he described as a 
reallife james bond drama 
he was approached in the desert by soldiers who were seeking 
help for the victim of a motorcycle accident the guard to the 
prince of bahrain 
they said the prince will give you anything if you will come 
and help us dorta said when we got there the prince was 
begging me to help the man and the guy was lying unconscious on the 
street he had a blood clot on the brain 
to the amazement of passersby dorta inserted an intravenous 
needle and hooked the patient to a cardiac monitor the 007 
airplane was summoned to take the guard to a hospital in rabat 
morocco 
mission accomplished dorta left the hospital but was stopped 
by soldiers demanding his passport 
i told them its back in the desert on the movie set 
dorta said they put me in a room where i sat and drank tea for 
six hours until the king gave permission for me to leave 
dortas patient recovered after surgery 
if it werent for jimmy i dont think he would have lived 
said michael g wilson who produced and wrote the bond flick 
its that kind of response that is very important to us so when 
it came time to film our next movie we wanted him back 
dorta drafted dr craig feied an emergency physician at george 
washington university medical center in washington and vincent 
young a harvard business graduate and founded lifestar 
dorta feied and a network of hundreds of emergency physicians 
throughout the country have traveled to movie sets in such places 
as the philippines austria tangiers mexico and the soviet union 
in addition to motion pictures the company also provided medical 
consultation for amnesty internationals 1988 human rights now 
concert tour which performed in major cities all over the world 
dorta also helped coordinate emergency medical teams after the 
1985 earthquake in mexico city and was part of a group of 
physicians who traveled to the soviet union after last falls 
earthquake in armenia 
the thing that makes us different from other entrepreneurs and 
businessmen is that we truly practice medicine dorta said 
that gives us more credibility 
lifestar uses computer links to the world health organization 
the centers for disease control and the state department to analyze 
everything from rumors of unrest in grenada to reports of a new 
outbreak of resistant malaria in zambia the company checks each 
persons immunizations types their blood and has access to blood 
that has been screened to be diseasefree by us and british 
standards 
because many medications in the united states dont have exact 
equivalents in other countries lifestar sends along a wellstocked 
portable pharmacy detailed plans are made for rapid transport to 
medical facilities in the event of injury or illness and once the 
filming begins lifestar physicians remain on the set 
lifestars prices vary depending on the size of the production 
and the risks and planning required young said 
any major film production can afford us young said if 
you compare what it costs for our services with what it would cost 
without our services it is free or very cheap for film producers 
wilson agreed 
its a reasonable expense and its worthwhile because they do 
an excellent job and can turn a disaster into no time lost he 
said when tim dalton cut his finger during the making of 
licence to kill if wed had to stop filming to take him to the 
hospital we would have lost at least half a day of filming that 
could mean anywhere from 50000 to 100000 
but we had a doctor on the set who could stitch him up 
immediately we think tim got better quality medical care and we 
were able to go right on filming 
lee proimos of firemans fund insurance co a los 
angelesbased firm that insures 60 to 75 percent of all feature 
films said fast effective medical care means fewer production 
delays reduced risk of lawsuits and lower insurance rates 
its a good situation for the actors the crew and the 
production company and its good for the insurance company 
proimos said 
although his work appears to involve the glamour of hollywood 
dorta says the lifestar doctor is the one dose of reality in a 
world of makebelieve

spain is cautiously feeling its way in the 
north atlantic treaty organization which it joined seven years ago 
most countries have been involved more years than us so we 
have to take things little by little said carlos miranda 
director of international security affairs at the foreign ministry 
emerging from decades of political isolation under the 
authoritarian regime of gen francisco franco spain is slowly 
shaping the role that its defense forces will play in nato 
we are going to allow a great deal of flexibility for this 
new player said us gen john galvin natos top military 
commander in europe 
spain formally joined nato on may 30 1982 rounding out the 
roster to 16 nations linking the united states and canada to 
western europe 
four years later the socialist government of prime minister 
felipe gonzalez put its membership to a popular vote the first 
nato member ever to do so a little more than 50 percent of the 
voters agreed the nation should remain in the alliance but with 
strings attached 
spain they decided would not be part of the integrated 
military structure nuclear weapons must not be stored on its soil 
and the us military presence in spain must be reduced 
we are nato with some special limitations said gen angel 
lobo deputy director for international affairs in the defense 
ministrys policy office 
no spanish troops are under natos command the only other 
country with forces outside the military structure is france which 
pulled out in 1966 iceland which also is a member has no armed 
forces 
unlike france spain takes part in key defense and nuclear 
strategy sessions held regularly by the alliance france has its 
own nuclear force 
even with conditions attached western officials were relieved 
that spain continued to cast its lot with the alliance 
spains membership they say strengthens the wests abilities 
to deter any threat from the east 
lying between portugal and france spain gives the alliance 
extra depth in europe 
it offers important coastal access particularly the strategic 
strait of gibraltar which links the atlantic ocean and the 
mediterranean sea 
spanish defense officials have been holding a series of 
discussions with nato commanders to decide just how spain will 
coordinate its defense forces with those of the alliance 
we have to invent sometimes formulas to suit the fact that we 
are not integrated said miranda of the foreign ministry but 
we want to be efficient in coordination we have to study the 
way to do it sometimes it takes time 
the first two of six coordination agreements are expected to 
be completed by years end the initial accords center on the air 
defense of spanish territory and air and naval operations in the 
eastern atlantic 
next on the list for discussion are the defense of spanish 
territory and naval and air operations in the western mediterranean 
officials are putting off until last the most difficult areas 
controlling the strait of gibraltar and using spanish territory for 
transit support and rearguard logistics 
spain does not recognize natos command of gibraltar a british 
colony spain claims sovereignty over the territory a demand 
rejected by the british government and seen as an obstacle to full 
participation in natos military structure 
spain has been more successful in demanding a reduction of us 
troops on its soil 
the us and spanish governments recently worked out an 
agreement to withdraw a highly visible us air force fighter wing 
from the torrejon air base on the outskirts of madrid the 72 f16s 
will be transferred over the next three years to southern italy 
the spanish insistence on the units removal prompted complaints 
that the gonzalez government was not shouldering its share of the 
western defense burden the fighter wing a crucial part of the 
us striking power in europe is assigned to the defense of natos 
southern flank along the mediterranean 
but even under the new agreement about 8000 american troops 
will continue to be stationed in spain many of them at the huge 
rota naval base on the atlantic 
a nato report released in december said about 70 percent of the 
airtoground weapons training of the us air force is conducted 
in spain along with about 50 percent of the airtoair weapons 
training 
moreover the report noted that spain has increased its military 
expenditures 
on average over the last decade it said spain was one of eight 
countries that generally reached the nato goal of increasing yearly 
defense spending by 3 percent 
still it said the percentage of spains gross domestic product 
the total value of goods and services earmarked for defense was 
well below the nato median the expenditures amounted to 24 
percent of gdp in 1987 slipping to 22 percent last year

the tiny channel islands of jersey and 
guernsey have become prospering offshore financial centers but some 
natives are concerned their idyllic way of life may be lost in too 
much wealth 
the fear in all our minds is that we will become another monte 
carlo says anne perchard a jersey dairy farmer 
with booming financial services industries and low taxes 
attracting both jobseekers and the wealthy the islands have 
introduced rules to drastically cut immigration 
jersey now allows just five new millionaires to take residence 
in the tax haven each year down from 15 and it has what it claims 
are the worlds only price controls on homes 
the islands growing number of highquality financial 
institutions provide a place for individuals and companies to 
legally shelter their money from their own countries taxes and to 
make more money on highyielding investments 
income and corporate tax rates are 20 percent and there are no 
sales inheritance or capital gains taxes 
attractions are the english language political stability the 
british time zone proximity to the continent and freedom from 
european economic community regulations 
but the islands generally follow british financial regulations 
and an absence of bank secrecy acts has helped them avoid the 
unsavory reputations of other tax havens 
the result has been a jobcreating economic boom that has 
brought the big benefits of full employment and government budget 
surpluses but the downside has been immigration pressures 
highrise buildings traffic jams and strained water supplies 
natives who arent sure they like this transformation clash with 
the newcomers who want credit for improving the islands living 
standards 
jersey has to manage the success so you actually dont kill 
the golden goose said jerseyman martin dryden who is managing 
director of gartmore fund managers international ltd 
jersey which has an area of 39 square miles has seen its 
population swell to 82000 from 60000 in 1961 the population of 
25squaremile guernsey has jumped to 60000 from 54000 in 1976 
many residents have one car and some have two which works out 
to about 100000 automobiles on the islands 
there are hopes and fears of more prosperity 
the islands which are dependencies of the british crown but not 
members of the european economic community are positioned to turn 
into offshore europe from offshore britain when the 
12nation community becomes a single market in 1992 
we see it as being a position of opportunity says colin 
powell jerseys leading civil servant 
the channel islands which also include the smaller still rural 
alderney herm and sark are in the english channel about 20 miles 
off normandy in france 
once part of the duchy of normandy the islands retained their 
allegiance to the king of england when normandy was freed of 
english rule in 1204 
although some patois and other french influences survive most 
people speak english gray stone cottages have names such as 
hillsea view and gardening is taken seriously 
bailiffs appointed by queen elizabeth ii preside over locally 
elected legislatures there are no political parties 
during world war ii the channel islands were the only british 
soil occupied by the nazis for five long years 
the islands financial services industries began in the 1960s 
and today with hundreds of banks and insurance companies and more 
than 1000 investment funds they dominate the islands economies 
jersey says its finance sector overtook tourism in 1986 and 
accounted for 40 percent of gross national product in 1987 
compared with 20 percent in 1975 
the islands gnp doubled from 1962 to 1987 while guernseys has 
grown an average 85 percent a year in the past three years 
to stem the population growth jersey now requires companies to 
obtain permission to increase staff and new companies need licenses 
we are selective powell says we would like to see 
continued profit growth of the institutions without people growth 
only people born on jersey and their children are allowed to buy 
and lease property in guernsey 90 percent of the housing market 
is reserved for locals 
in jersey key professional workers can rent a home of their own 
only after living in employerprovided accommodation for 10 years 
but that right expires next year a right to buy a home after 
living on the island for 20 years expires in the year 2000 
each years five new millionaires have had to convince a housing 
committee that they are of social and economic value to the 
islands says committee chairman hendric vandervliet 
seeking to protect young locals the committee also reviews all 
home sales and if it thinks a price is too high orders it 
lowered prices would be 40 percent higher without these controls 
vandervliet says 
real estate agents and other opponents say the controls 
discourage sellers and make it more difficult for islanders to get 
homes 
all its doing is closing the market up says sylvia nixon 
a 44yearold jersey taxi driver who after a twoyear search 
managed to find a property in bad condition for the equivalent of 
72000 
on both islands natives worry that agriculture will die out 
but robert lindell general manager of chase manhattan banks 
jersey operations says he is getting tired of the locals 
complaints 
its the financial industry that allows them to have a very 
nice standard of living 
says norman le cheminant guernseys top civil servant most 
people would agree that the problems of prosperity are better than 
not having prosperity

tourism has fallen off sharply in hong kong 
since the suppression of the students prodemocracy movement in 
neighboring china 
hong kongs tourism boom came to an abrupt halt june 34 when 
the chinese army rolled into beijings tiananmen square and opened 
fire on thousands of demonstrators 
legions of travelers including many americans immediately 
canceled trips to china that included stopovers in this british 
colony tourist industry officials said other visitors are staying 
away from hong kong because of its proximity to china 
the hong kong tourist association estimates that the number of 
visitors to hong kong in june was 20 percent off from the same 
month a year earlier and believes julys figures will turn out to 
be similar when compiled 
the decline has affected the 42billion tourism industry from 
the plush fivestar hotels to the retailers who sell knickknacks 
at popular tourist haunts 
one hotel executive said the current situation is good for 
customers because hotels have to be more guestoriented 
but for us it will be tough he addedweve been spoiled 
in the past 
internal figures kept by the hotel industry based on 20 leading 
hotels indicate average occupancy plummeted to 75 percent in june 
from 91 percent a year earlier the south china morning post 
newspaper said the rate in july was 64 percent 
the news also is glum in the village of stanley a 30minute bus 
ride from downtown hong kong it had become a tourist mecca because 
of its narrow streets lined with stores selling discount clothes 
gaudy tshirts and typical hong kong gewgaws such as mechanical 
toy pandas 
the stanley streets often crowded with tourists have become 
uncommonly quiet even for the slow summer season with some 
retailers glumly seated outside stores empty of customers 
the number of tourists has dropped since june 4 everybody 
knows that groused ken fu of the 23 market in stanley in the 
clothing shops window was a sign advertising a crazy sale of 
sweaters that had prices slashed by twothirds after the beijing 
massacre 
because of the events in beijing we have had a great loss in 
business said a clerk at the stanley chinese products co 
ian wade chairman of the retail management association of hong 
kong said sales in the colony were very depressed in june 
while he believes businesses are recovering retail stores that 
depend on tourism are probably still down 25 percent on average 
tourism which accounts for roughly 10 percent of hong kongs 
gross domestic product had been on a long hot streak 
nearly 56 million visitors primarily tourists came to hong 
kong last year up 24 percent from 1987 and 154 percent from 1979 
according to tourist association statistics about 24 million 
visitors came to the colony in the first five months of this year 
a 15percent increase from the same period in 1988 
most of those tourists came from japan where the rising yen 
currency made hong kong prices cheap and from taiwan where the 
nationalist chinese government recently gave permission for its 
citizens to visit china 
local hotels were delighted maintaining occupancy rates at 
levels of around 90 percent or higher generally occupancy rates 
of about 50 percent for established hotels and 65 percent for new 
hotels are necessary to break even in hong kong 
about three dozen more hotels are expected to open within the 
next 30 months a 91story hotel with 2400 rooms is scheduled to 
open sometime after 1993 
it is not clear whether all those new projects will remain 
viable as existing hotels scramble to return to prejune 4 
occupancy levels in one special promotion since the beijing 
crackdown 37 hotels have offered six nights for the price of four 
meanwhile the tourism association has been spreading the 
message overseas that hong kong remains safe and is not part of 
china the organization also has increased invitations to foreign 
journalists to visit the colony 
but the key to recovery may well be the plight of chinas own 
tourism industry which also came to a virtual halt after june 4 
and has yet to recover recent statistics indicate that more than 
onefourth of visitors to hong kong were traveling to china

once while oliver north was riding high a 
spokesman for ronald reagans white house issued a statement that 
seemed to rule out us talks with lebanese hostagetakers north 
objected saying that administration policy was to invite talks 
while forbidding any concessions to terrorists 
so the statement was amended 
in that 1985 refinement the reagan administration said it had 
offered to talk with anyone including the kidnappers themselves 
but never had received a response 
the distinction was a fine one revolving around the question of 
what would amount to negotiating with terrorists as opposed to 
talking with any and all parties about freeing the captives 
to negotiate is to communicate with another party in an effort 
to settle something the word implies bargaining and compromise 
yielding one thing to get another president bush says he will not 
permit that reagan said so publicly even while his administration 
was secretly breaching its own rule in the iran armsforhostages 
deal 
as bush seeks to open lines of discussion for the release of the 
eight americans held captive in lebanon he has drawn the line 
against the kind of negotiation that would amount to ransom for 
hostages im not going to do anything that would put some other 
american perhaps in some other place at some other time at 
risk bush said last week and that means trading off or 
negotiating for hostages 
put another way bush said he would do nothing that will be 
seen as quid pro quo for hostages 
the president said there was no subtle change in policy behind 
his statements the record bears him out his position in the 
current situation matches the avowed policy of the reagan years 
when the beirut hostage ordeal began as vice president bush 
headed a task force on terrorism which declared in its 1986 report 
that there should be no negotiations for deals with terrorists 
but there has been a change in tone in the heightened tension 
over hostages since israel seized a shiite cleric in southern 
lebanon on july 28 bush said he is looking for contact through 
every possible channel 
im not talking about terms im talking about talking to get 
people out that are held against their will he said and i 
think i covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when i 
said good will begets good will 
that message was directed to iran which holds some measure of 
control over the shiite moslem factions holding the beirut 
hostages tehran is said to have offered help on the hostages in 
exchange for the release of iranian assets held by the united 
states 
the administration is willing only to suggest that good things 
could happen if the atmosphere between the two nations were to 
improve after a decadelong freeze and that nothing would do more 
to improve it than release of the hostages longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
kidnapped on march 16 1985 
in a way that does involve negotiations guarded and indirect 
toward a longterm thaw that would bring freedom for the hostages 
and later presumably would include the release of iranian assets 
impounded by the united states in the embassy hostage crisis a 
decade ago 
that wont be a simple process us and iranian estimates of 
the sums involved are billions of dollars apart and an 
international tribunal in the hague is settling asset disputes 
some 39 billion in iranian assets were returned after the embassy 
hostages were released in 1981 
theres at least a chance that pattern could recur and the 
administration knows that if it did there would be suggestions 
that the whole deal had been cut in advance but the white house 
says it wont be done that way 
we are not willing to link the iranian assets questions to the 
hostage question fitzwater said that fits within the 
definition of our policy of not trading arms or money or whatever 
for hostages and of not paying ransom for hostages 
he said that applies even though the assets were frozen in the 
first place because americans had been taken hostage 
then the other conciliatory half of the message the 
administration is open to improved relations with iran and there 
are benefits associated with having better relations with the 
united states 
but we wouldnt speculate on any specific one fitzwater 
said

old marshall ferdinand foch who led the allies to victory in 
world war i said at the end of that conflict this is not peace 
it is an armistice for 20 years he was right almost to the day 
nearly two decades later after years of threat and bluster of 
depression and inequality of fears and lies on sept 1 1939 50 
years ago on friday push finally came to shove the first shots 
were fired in world war ii 
no one could say the world did not have sufficient notice 
for instance on the last day of january 1939 at the white house 
president franklin delano roosevelt had called in the senate 
military affairs committee to confide his fearful appraisal of the 
world his countrymen many of them suffered from a bad case of 
isolationism yet he told the senators 
about three years ago we got pretty definite information that 
there was in the making a policy of world domination between 
germany italy and japanthere are two ways of looking at it the 
firstis the hope that somebody will assassinate hitler from 
within that somebody will kill mussolini or he will get a bad cold 
in the morning and diethe other attitude is that we must try to 
prevent the domination of the world 
he had drawn the line adolf hitler whom he called a wild 
man and a nut was the enemy whether the nation knew it or 
not peace was slipping through the trembling fingers of europe 
hitler had a timetable had since he powered his way to control 
of the german government on march 5 1933 in germanys last free 
elections a day after roosevelt was inaugurated as president of the 
united states 
hitler had taken a broken germany rearmed it in secret bluffed 
his way into the rhineland which germany had given up after world 
war i he buttressed the fascist dictator francisco franco in spain 
and conspired with italian dictator benito mussolini to divide 
europe he bullied his way into austria and czechoslovakia and so 
intimidated britain and france that they welcomed the munich pact 
which british prime minister neville chamberlain considered a 
guarantee of peace in our time it only convinced hitler that 
the old world war i allies were willing to pay for peace at any 
price 
hitler had already put poland on the plate he needed it not only 
for a breadbasket but as a source of labor he would have poland 
even if it drew britain and france into war he was not however 
ready to fight a war on two fronts 
so he sought joseph stalins assistance in the east one of the 
most bizarre alliances in modern history the communist and the 
fascist philosophy be damned 
the allies had dillydallied over a pact with stalin to outflank 
hitler they obviously did not savor doing business with the soviet 
leader hitler had no such compunctions on aug 20 1939 he agreed 
to a sovietdrafted nonaggression pact in return the soviets 
would get a free hand in the eastern baltic and a share of poland 
hitler then put the polish question on automatic if the west 
went to war italy promised to rattle sabers in the south to occupy 
some french troops without actually joining the battle 
suddenly on aug 31 the polish ambassadors lines from berlin 
to warsaw were cut that night hitler broadcast to his people peace 
proposals to poland which the poles never heard his usual ploy for 
preparing the german mind for war 
finally he launched operation canned goods planned months 
before ss troops in polish uniforms staged a mock attack on a 
german radio station at gleiwitz on the polish border leaving a 
drugged concentration camp inmate smeared with blood as a german 
casualty of the attack there were other such provocations 
along the border 
berlin was calmly asleep but all communications to the outside 
world were cut berliners would awaken to a war that would 
eventually destroy them and much of europe as well 
at 520 am sept 1 smack on hitlers timetable a german 
warplane attacked the polish fishing village of puck and an adjacent 
air base on the gulf of danzig twentyfive minutes later a shell 
from the world war i battleship schleswig holstein made a direct hit 
on a polish ammunition dump at westerplatte at first light the 
wehrmacht began a motorized march toward warsaw and a new word 
blitzkrieg lightning war was introduced into the military 
lexicon 
at 220 am washington time four hours after the attack began 
the phone at president roosevelts bedside rang it was his 
ambassador in paris bill bullitt 
tony biddle has just got through from warsaw mr president 
several german divisions are deep in polish territory and fighting 
is heavy tony said there were reports of bombers over the city 
then he was cut off 
well bill its come at last god help us all 
in london mobilization was ordered on sept 3 britain went to 
war winston churchill who had warned persistently of the german 
threat was made a part of an expanded war cabinet and first lord of 
the admiralty where he had served previously before he got there 
the word went out to the fleet winston is back 
in berlin hitler received the news of britains declaration with 
an immobile stare but hermann goering the head of the luftwaffe 
said if we lose this war then god have mercy on us

hitler donned a military uniform and pledged to his people he 
would not return to civilian clothes until the war was won a 
promise he kept to his death 
the french played for time adding a few insignificant hours to 
their mobilization before declaring war 
there were those who thought the poles could hold out for a 
couple of months even the germans thought in terms of weeks but 
german power had not been tested yet it became a war of horsedrawn 
artillery against motorized guns that could cover bad roads at 40 
miles an hour a war of lances against tanks 
the polish air force was destroyed in 48 hours by german bombers 
stukas punctuated the sky divebombing polish troops who quickly 
learned to lay low until the planes came out of their dives and fire 
at them as they struggled for altitude 
cracow polands second city fell on sept 6 that same night 
the polish government fled the capital within one week polands 35 
divisions had been either surrounded or destroyed by the fastmoving 
germans it was all over in 17 days 
the germans tried to hurry the soviets into the fray and to move 
to prearranged borders as their part of the spoils and to take 
some of the international blame wily stalin however wanted the 
germans to agree to a statement that the soviets had entered poland 
to spare white russians from nazi rule the flabbergasted germans 
would not agree 
so stalin redrew the occupation zones giving up a small slice 
of poland for control of all the balkan countries 
stalin got more than the german wanted to give him ukranian 
wheat and romanian oil and a buffer of countries against likely 
german perfidy never mind that hitler would take it all back in 
june 1941 after he had conquered europe but for now it was a 
secure border 
the expected clash of the giants in the west didnt happen the 
french army brought to the front by a divided government sat 
behind the maginot line unwilling to force the issue 
the first british troops could not be expected on the continent 
until october besides the conquest of poland had been a 
demonstration of incredible military force even hitler was grateful 
for the respite any incursion any air raid would require his 
personal approval the poised angels of destruction bided their time 
behind the siegfried line 
the stagnant war was called the sitzkrieg the major 
confrontation would be in abeyance until hitler was good and ready 
in the spring of 1940 
the german navy however was given carte blanche with the war 
against britain only 10 hours old the british liner athenia with 
1400 passengers was torpedoed without warning and sunk some 200 
miles west of scotlands hebrides islands of the 112 lost 28 were 
americans 
the germans denied that their submarines had attacked it was 
later proved they had they accused churchill of putting a time 
bomb aboard to influence british and international public opinion 
nevertheless in the first week of the war the germans sent 11 
british ships to the bottom for all of september uboats claimed 26 
ships sunk and german mines took three more 
meanwhile in the united states roosevelt sought to move his 
nation out of its isolationist stance he was he said almost 
literally walking on eggs so politically sensitive was the issue 
at stake was the neutrality act finally on oct 27 by a 6330 
vote the senate repealed the act with the house following arms 
were now for sale on a cashandcarry basis and the first british 
freighters began loading a week later 
while all of this was going on a curious and ominous letter 
passed the presidents desk drafted by leo szilard one of the many 
displaced scientists who fled hitler and signed by another albert 
einstein it told of advancements in atomic research of potential 
explosive devices of incredible power each capable of destroying a 
whole city 
roosevelt was slow to understand the cautious scientific 
communication but when an adviser pointed out that napoleon once 
had turned down fultons steamboat that might have carried his 
troops to britain the president got the point 
roosevelt and hitler were ironic characters of shakespearean 
proportions both rose to power a day apart in the depths of the 
depression the world was out of work and out of hope while 
berliners carted their nearly worthless deutsche marks to market by 
wheelbarrow a third of america was unemployed 400000 rode the 
rails new york city had a million jobless 82 breadlines and some 
7000 men and boys on the streets shining shoes for pennies 
both leaders pulled their nations up out of despair by their 
bootstraps hitler by edict roosevelt by innovative social 
programs they then led their peoples through a cataclysm such as 
the world had never seen and they would die within 18 days of each 
other in april 1945 
the failed german artist who had lived in viennese flophouses 
and survived on charity soup shot himself next to his poisoned 
mistressbride in a beseiged bunker the patrician american with 
withered legs was struck down by a massive stroke while waiting to 
sit for his portrait looking forward to the international 
conference that would charter the united nations 
within their political lifetimes some 50 million people vanished 
from the face of the earth in the violence of war 20 million of 
them in the soviet union alone of the 70 million men and women who 
fought in the various armies 17 million were killed

editors note few people have ever associated numbers with 
sounds but they play sweet music for rajan srinivasen mahadevan 
his phenomenal recall of numbers has brought him fame and made him 
the object of scientific curiosity and left him a little wistful 
about the blessings of ordinary life 
</TEXT>

its only fitting that rajans story begin 
with a number myx1689 the number that started it all 
myx554 was the license plate on the second car that pulled up to 
the house in mangalore india where his parents were having a 
party myx558 was the third 
some other 5yearold might have sung a song or passed hors 
doeuvres to show off to the grownups rajan srinivasen mahadevan 
recited the license plates of all 40 cars in the order in which 
theyd been parked 
that was the first anyone knew of rajan mahadevans astonishing 
memory twentyseven years later millions know of it and there are 
days when he wishes he had sung a song or passed hors doeuvres 
a memory that can hold fast to 31811 random numbers yet 
persistently misplace keys is a curious thing a wondrous oddity 
that can bring opportunity fame perhaps even immortality to its 
owner 
but what of the other things a man has humor creativity 
intellect this damn thing overpowers everything else to a 
point rajan says 
as a child he says in the fluid accented english he was raised 
with i used to be so lost in my own thoughts i would talk to 
myself it was hard to fit in other kids didnt know what to make 
of me 
rajans memory was not unexpected its like john lennons son 
and music he says his father a prominent surgeon knows all 
2156 lines of william shakespeares 154 sonnets 
i was expected to make it big in life but my academic career 
was like the drawing of a mountain range 
rajan tried engineering and business administration but felt no 
affinity for either then someone suggested he put his memory to the 
test by trying to win a place in the guinness book of world records 
he began studying a computer printout of the first 200000 places 
of pi the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle 
the ultimate test of numerical memory pi begins 314159 then 
continues on indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern two 
columbia university mathematicians recently calculated pi to 480 
million decimal places 
on june 12 1980 rajan flew to chicago where he stunned the 
fifth international congress on yoga and meditation by reciting the 
first 10000 numbers 
on july 5 1981 he stood before a capacity crowd in a mangalore 
meeting hall and rattled off numbers so quickly the judges could 
barely keep up for three hours and 49 minutes his memory never 
faltered then finally a lapse he forgot the 31812th digit of pi 
a 5 
never mind the record 20013 had toppled on feb 16 
1983 i saw my name in the book of records and i relaxed that was 
the argument stopper until then people could say so you have a 
good memory so what 
but from 1981 to 1987 i was the best in the world 
in 1987 that honor went to hideaki tomoyori of japan for 
reciting 40000 digits in 17 hours 21 minutes 
still memory expert charles thompson a kansas state university 
psychology professor is convinced rajans memory is superior the 
japanese guy made up a story a mnemonic to help him remember the 
numbers his memory isnt as good 
in the lab where thompson is studying rajans memory numbers 
flash past on a computer screen one per second and rajan responds 
as if to music he taps his feet and rocks rhythmically back and 
forth in his chair now and then he jiggles his legs 
theres something about the way the numbers sound he says 
its not the way they look its the way they sound 
for example rajan finds the numbers in pi from the 2901th to 
3000th places 81911979399520614196 and so on particularly 
melodic the series between 3701 to 3800 beginning 2332609729 
is very jarring 
just as you cant describe how you remember your phone number 
neither can rajan describe the process by which he remembers pi 
says thompson who has been trying since january to figure it out 
along with jerome frieman an animal behaviorist and thaddeus 
cowan a cognitive psychologist 
the first time we tested him we said oh my god thompson 
thinks rajan may have the most remarkable numerical memory known to 
science since s a patient immortalized in clinical literature 
by ar luria the soviet psychologist who studied him for nearly 30 
years 
s was sv shereshevskii a soviet newspaper reporter whose 
memory was discovered during the mid1920s by an editor infuriated 
by his failure to take notes s didnt need to he recalled 
everything hed ever seen or heard 
what he couldnt do was forget ultimately unable to distinguish 
between conversations hed heard five minutes or five years before 
s wound up in an asylum 
rajans memory is exceptional only for numbers in all other 
areas names faces words it is average and unlike s he 
can forget although it is hard to willfully forget numbers 
random numbers memorized one session come flooding back during 
another keeping the sequences straight requires discipline and 
concentration

these are tedious tests this months test records ability to 
recall random digits that appear one per second on the screen ten 
is extraordinary most people remember about seven rajan has 
recalled 64 
his is not a photographic memory but a highly structured system 
of some sort thompson says rajan has pi stored in a very 
systematic way in his brain 
as photocopied from a textbook the numbers are organized in 
blocks of a thousand with five blocks to a page well say give 
us the 18336th digit of pi the time it takes rajan to search 
his memory for the right thousand block then the right hundred and 
finally to pinpoint the number hints at how these storage and 
retrieval processes work 
so does the occasional error if he makes a mistake without 
fail hell be in exactly the right spot but a thousand digits off 
or hell be in the right spot only 10000 digits off right 
position wrong page 
a threeyear national institutes of health grant pays for the 
research and for rajans work toward a masters degree in 
physiological psychology i want to know what neurons what 
neurochemicals are responsible for memory 
the entire project could be interesting and fun and yet not 
tell us a thing thompson says what we hope is that were 
luckier than that we hope his memory serves as a magnifying glass 
to show us how ordinary memory works that will depend if were 
clever enough and lucky enough to do the right tests there are a 
jillion tests 
as random numbers rush past rajan sometimes makes fleeting 
associations with formulas learned in physics chemistry or math 
with distances between cities with zip codes or historic dates now 
and then he chuckles softly at some private numerical joke as the 
computer spits out 1865 he murmurs lincoln who was 
assassinated that year 
such connections dont help him remember he says theyre merely 
random thoughts that flit through his mind small points of interest 
along the infinite journey through the decimal expansion of pi 
with testing over for another day rajan would much rather 
discuss something else his talent for languages artwork or 
cooking a man is more than his memory no matter how good it is 
thirty years from now i want to see myself as wellrounded i 
want to learn more languages to learn musical instruments to 
become as accomplished as possible one way to grow as a human being 
is to develop your potential and expand mentally then to help 
others develop as well 
after 67 interviews in 56 days he is tired of performing tired 
of being asked if he could memorize a phone book like dustin hoffman 
in rain man tired of explaining hes not an idiot savant 
rajans growing celebrity is evident as he lopes along the wooded 
paths of the campus a solitary figure deep in thought reedthin 
with dark eyes darting restlessly beneath inky curls he shrugs off 
his reverie and responds jovially each time a student approaches to 
comment on this tv appearance or that magazine article 
he chose kansas state for its psychology department as well as 
its generous financial aid never imagining how lonely how 
incongruous he might feel in a small town in kansas no matter how 
friendly the town 
there are far fewer distractions at ksu than at a ucla or a 
columbia he says philosophically but he never misses a chance to 
travel to bigger cities and the distances are among the numbers 
locked in his memory 1361 miles to new york 1294 to washington 
498 to dallas 114 to kansas city 
there are other international students at ksu but most are men 
and it isnt male company he longs for as he trudges back and forth 
between the campus and his bachelor apartment he shares it with 
another indian student whos usually at his girlfriends im an 
incredibly lonely guy rajan says 
its hard to tell at fast eddys the pool hall where he seems 
to greet everyone for 20 joyful minutes he stretches gracefully 
over a table in the corner his lanky arms send balls crashing as 
dave jenson watches approvingly 
the regulars know all about rajans memory but we try not to 
talk about it says jenson the owners son we take things in 
stride 
later rajan finds refuge with best friend ruth ridder who feels 
a kinship based on her own british upbringing ruth husband tony 
and 3yearold hannah are my american family he says he and 
ruth take turns cooking each other indian meals in her kitchen 
where his memory is as irrelevant as a trick knee 
hes funny hes generous with his time and his finances hes 
also unreliable forgetful and annoying in lots of wayshe forgets 
our phone number constantly ruth says 
when it comes to his memory im in the whatsthepoint 
category i worry for him he has a million acquaintances but hes 
lonely too many people try to make him a performing animal we try 
not to talk about it 
in spite of himself rajan sometimes uses his memory to draw 
people to him once he got a woman at the cafe to give him 57 
random numbers 
he drank two cappuccinos read interview magazine from cover to 
cover and discussed the ill way we treat nicaragua tony ridder 
recalls then he repeated them to her backwards 
rajan admits to having hustled the occasional beer a beer hed 
barely touch but says thats all in the past these days he 
confines his wizardry to the lab so as not to contaminate the 
research 
besides nobody will touch me with a barge pole 
tonight its his turn to cook and he arrives at ruths laden 
with spices from the international market he chases everyone into 
the living room strips off his shirt and spends the next hour alone 
in the kitchen shrouded in steam 
i close my eyes and im back at my mothers table eating 
supper he says lost in a memory not of numbers but of how it 
feels to belong

editors note the governor of puerto rico calls it a 
historical first if congress approves the proposal it already 
has the backing of president bush residents of the caribbean 
island will be given a chance to vote on whether to become a state 
break away entirely from us control or continue the commonwealth 
form of government it would be a first because the outcome of the 
vote would be binding

puerto rico and the us senate are 
preparing for the first vote in more than 20 years on whether this 
tropical island of 33 million spanishspeaking people will become 
the 51st state 
a plebiscite planned for 1991 would allow puerto rico to decide 
whether to remain a us commonwealth break away to form an 
independent nation or become the first state admitted to the union 
since alaska and hawaii in 1959 
under a bill approved by a senate committee on aug 3 the 
plebiscite would be selfexecuting that is the us government for 
the first time would agree in advance to accept whatever status 
puerto ricans choose 
its never been tackled this way before gov rafael 
hernandez colon said in an interview its a historical first 
president bush endorsed the plebiscite proposal in his state of 
the union message in february and said he backed statehood for 
puerto rico however the bill received committee approval by a 
narrow vote 117 indicating it could run into trouble in the 
full senate and house of representatives 
of the three options only independence appears to have no 
realistic chance of winning but the plebiscite proposal has 
rekindled anticolonial sentiment the biggest proindependence 
rally in recent history and a series of minor bombings coincided 
with senate hearings in san juan in june 
hernandez colon who advocates continuation of the 37year 
commonwealth arrangement but with more autonomy proposed the 
plebiscite in his inaugural address in january at the start of his 
second consecutive fouryear term 
he says a referendum the first since 1967 is needed to settle 
the deeply divisive status issue which has dominated puerto ricos 
political debate virtually since spain ceded the caribbean island to 
the united states in 1898 at the end of the spanishamerican war 
as the home of roosevelt roads naval base one of the worlds 
largest puerto rico is strategically important but successive 
administrations have said puerto ricans should have the right to 
determine their own fate 
this issue goes to the very heart of our system of government 
to the principles of selfdetermination and of government by the 
consent of the governed sen j bennett johnston dla chairman 
of the senates committee on energy and natural resources said in 
introducing enabling legislation 
if puerto rico became a state it would be by far the poorest and 
the only one with spanish as its main language with its spanish 
heritage customs literature salsa and merengue music and its 
location in the caribbean it would also be a state with a 
distinctly latin american flavor 
but after nearly 100 years of us dominance and with more than 2 
million puerto ricans living in the states the island is 
unmistakably american us post offices the dollar shopping 
malls and 31 burger kings in the san juan metropolitan area alone 
are just a few of the reminders 
were latin americans perhaps in our music in our language 
but were americans in many ways in our daily lives says carlos 
romero barcelo a former governor and leader of the statehood party 
in our attitudes in our political heritage were definitely 
american 
yet puerto ricans retain a strong sense of national identity 
politicians invariably refer to puerto rico as a pais or 
country and the people take pride in having their own olympic team 
and miss universe contestant 
under the commonwealth puerto ricans are us citizens and are 
eligible for military service food stamps and most other benefits 
available to other americans however they pay no federal taxes and 
cannot vote for president 
although puerto rico is selfgoverning it has no control over 
immigration international trade or defense the island sends no 
senators or congressmen to washington only a nonvoting resident 
commissioner

statehood and independence supporters say commonwealth is only 
another name for colonialism 
we are a territory by us constitutional terms and a colony 
by international terms romero says it is a status he says that 
makes puerto ricans secondclass citizens with no vote and no 
control over their destiny 
the united states he asserts is one of the few colonial 
powers left in the world that is a smear on the nations face 
commonwealth supporters contend that the status quo is the only 
arrangement that allows puerto ricans to retain their cultural 
identity while reaping the benefits of us largesse 
the federal government spent 65 billion on puerto rico last 
year and an estimated 60 percent of puerto rican families receive 
money under the foodstamp program the economy is further 
underpinned by tax exemptions granted to us subsidiaries which 
provide 10 billion in local deposits and an estimated 30000 direct 
and indirect jobs 
the one thing that works politically is the fear that they may 
lose some of these benefits says aw maldonado a prominent 
commonwealth supporter and newspaper columnist 
the independence party has always maintained that the united 
states has no right under international law to occupy puerto rico 
the partys leader ruben berrios martinez has proposed a 
transition period during which us programs would be phased out to 
avoid economic disruption 
berrios contends that congress wont accept puerto rico as a 
state because to do so would immediately boost the political clout 
of hispanics 
puerto rico would be a representative of latin america in the 
congress he said in a recent interview with the prostatehood el 
nuevo dia 
earlier this century the independence movement was a powerful 
force but support waned as the commonwealth took hold there are 
still extremists who advocate the violent overthrow of us control 
but they have been less active in recent years 
some critics of statehood have suggested that it could result in 
a situation similiar to northern ireland with a militant element 
perpetually trying to force separation 
since 1968 the commonwealth and statehood parties have held the 
governors mansion with almost equal frequency and elections 
usually result in neardead heats it is unclear however whether 
either party could muster a 50percentplus majority in a status 
plebiscite 
in the 1967 plebiscite 60 percent of the people voted to 
continue the commonwealth relationship 39 percent for statehood and 
1 percent for independence that vote was not binding on congress 
and the statehood and independence parties did not actively campaign 
a poll published in february by el nuevo dia indicated that 
commonwealth status is less popular than it was 20 years ago but 
remains the favored choice 
the poll carried out by the yankelovich organization before bush 
publicly backed statehood found 45 percent for commonwealth 35 
percent for statehood and 5 percent for independence with the 
remainder undecided the survey of 500 voters had a statistical 
margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent 
to bolster support for the status quo hernandez colon has 
proposed what he calls enhanced commonwealth in which puerto 
rico could reject any federal laws deemed unfair to the island 
the governor also has asked that puerto rico be given economic 
jurisdiction over its territorial waters authority to issue us 
passports and the right to negotiate international trade agreements 
he has acknowledged that congress is unlikely to grant all the 
concessions 
plans call for congressional passage of a plebiscite bill by the 
end of 1990 so that the vote can be taken in 1991 before local and 
national elections the following year the plebiscite is tentatively 
set for june 4 1991

the grand old man of puerto ricos 
statehood movement is luis a ferre a millionaire philanthropist 
and former governor 
at 85 the venerated don luis is still going strong 
overseeing his charitable foundation and chasing an ideal that has 
eluded him over a political career spanning nearly half a century 
us statehood for puerto rico 
i knew that this was going to take time he said in an 
interview a few days before flying to washington for senate hearings 
on puerto ricos future relationship with the united states it 
was a question of waiting for the thing to evolve to the proper 
time 
ferre says that time has finally come and predicts a referendum 
planned for 1991 will see a 60percent majority in favor of 
abandoning puerto ricos status as a us commonwealth and making 
the caribbean island the 51st state 
ferre has played a prominent role in puerto rican politics since 
world war ii he was a member of the assembly that produced the 1952 
constitution founded the prostatehood new progressive party in 
1967 and was governor from 1969 to 1972 today he is chairman of 
the islands republican party 
yet his most enduring work may be his philanthropy and in 
particular the ponce museum of art which londons financial times 
called one of the most distinguished private collections in the 
western hemisphere outside the united states 
ferre opened the museum in ponce his birthplace in southern 
puerto rico in 1959 with 120 of his own paintings today it houses 
500 paintings including several noted preraphaelites along with 
hundreds of sculptures and artifacts with a total estimated value 
of 50 million 
ferres grandfather was a french engineer who worked on the 
panama canal before settling in cuba his father antonio moved to 
puerto rico as a young man and married maria aguayo casals a cousin 
of the spanish cellist pablo casals who lived in puerto rico 
ferre studied engineering at the massachusetts institute of 
technology where he was captain of the fencing team 
he also trained at the new england conservatory of music he is 
an accomplished classical pianist occasionally performing in 
public and still tries to put in a few hours of practice every day 
it was during his university days ferre said that he developed 
a passion for the american way of democracy and eventual 
statehood for puerto rico 
on his return to the island ferre got a job as an engineer at 
the puerto rico iron works later he and a brother joseph founded 
the puerto rico cement co in ponce the source of the familys 
wealth 
in his first philanthropic venture ferre founded the ponce 
public library in 1937 at about the same time he bought the citys 
newspaper el dia which was in danger of folding my theory was 
that a city without a newspaper is a city without a soul he says 
when he became governor ferre sold the newspaper to his son 
antonio who moved it to san juan it is now the prostatehood el 
nuevo dia one of the biggest of puerto ricos four dailies

its like squeezing an orange a doortodoor squeeze says 
vince lane who last year took over as chairman of the cha whose 18 
complexes are home to 150000 people 
i want them out i want to keep them out 
his tactics have included unannounced police sweeps of the 
projects and searches of many apartments prompting a lawsuit by the 
american civil liberties union 
lanes efforts may rankle some tenants but they yielded a 
13percent drop in the crime rate over the final seven months of 
1988 
lane 47 has a masters degree in business administration from 
the university of chicago he drinks herbal tea for lunch and reads 
lee iacocca books in his spare time 
a divorced former developer and entrepreneur lane is accustomed 
to getting his way and considers himself anything but a civil 
servant his supporters call that an asset his critics call it a 
detriment 
i think some of the things hes done have been questionable 
legally but theyve been understandable in dealing with the 
social decay the frustration of tenants says gary orfield 
professor of public policy at the university of chicago its a 
lot better than doing nothing 
for example at rockwell gardens the most dangerous cha 
development where eight in 100 residents were reported robbed 
raped assaulted or murdered in 1987 the crime rate dropped 32 
percent 
ironically lane says the overall crime statistics rose as 
people became less afraid to report crimes and as gangs pushed out 
of their territories by the sweeps went to battle rivals for 
control of remaining domains 
despite the improvements at rockwell living there is no picnic 
its kind of tough says antonio woods 14 as he and a group 
of youngsters cruised the project grounds one afternoon you dont 
know whats going to happen you dont know who comes up to you 
woods lives in a rockwell building recently sandblasted to 
remove graffiti and secured by door monitors who check the 
identification cards of anyone entering the building when lane 
visited the building recently some residents shouted stop the 
lockdown as he passed by 
its like jail woods says acknowledging his ambivalence 
toward the arrangement 
random shootings on the playground have stopped but life is 
still far from perfect say woods and his friends we need a new 
playground with some basketball rims he says 
lane would like to see that happen with a plan that comes from 
childhood memories in the 1950s he lived across the street from a 
housing project on chicagos south side 
they had neat nice basketball courts swimming pools the 
whole bit he says it was far preferable to where i lived 
swimming pools might be pushing it he says but his realistic 
programs call for grass instead of mudcaked lawns flowers instead 
of weeds and resident programs instead of gang activity much of 
those programs is to come from residentorganized groups financially 
independent of the housing authority 
right now gangs are the only organized activity for young 
people he says when residents are able to not worry about 
staying alive they will actively participate in any other activity 
of a normal community 
jack kemp secretary of the us department of housing and urban 
development has called lanes plans a model for the nation but 
praise is more forthcoming than money 
he has a lot of ways and ideas that are not orthodox for public 
housing and those unorthodox methods get peoples attention says 
gertrude jordan regional director of hud which funds the major 
share of chas 150 million annual budget

but lane says he is frustrated by a lack of money and the 
quagmire of bureaucracy he needs to wade through to get it although 
he has managed to add 8 million to this years budget he estimates 
it would take 740 million to bring chas buildings up to par 
ultimately what happens in the cha depends on what happens in 
washington orfield says 
jack kemp wants to pretend housing problems can be solved by 
good will and enthusiasm at the local level but you need money to 
solve the basic problems he says my feeling is that if lane 
doesnt get some support on a serious level from washington his 
enthusiasm will detely covered by stacks 
of sheet music and by shelves bulging with music books 
the office is in old public school 68 at 127 w 127th st on a 
floor rented by the choir turnbull spoke over a muted background of 
major third chords sung in unison about 30 boys were warming up in 
a nearby classroom its windows covered by heavy wire mesh and 
overlooking a row of tenements disfigured by graffiti some boarded 
up and abandoned 
the towering robust tenor and former public school teacher took 
over later praising and cajoling as he conducted a selection of 
works including bachs christ lag in todesbanden in german one 
passage that sounded perfect to the casual listener raised his ire 
thats unacceptable what kind of reading is that he 
thundered slamming a meaty hand down on his note stand the kids 
some in their midteens all clearly respectful did it again 
without a murmur 
turnbull holds a doctorate in music and is proud of the boys 
choirs international reputation of excellence besides german the 
ensemble sings in french italian hebrew and latin as well as 
english and has toured much of europe it has sung in st pauls in 
london and stgermaindespres in paris and was off to japan this 
month 
its a very unique sound turnbull says rejecting attempts 
at comparison with wellknown european boys choirs unlike those 
the harlem ensemble includes tenors and basses as well as the 
traditional trebles 
there are those purists who say there is only one way to sing 
it but in fact the boys choir of harlem experience is the boys 
choir of harlem experience he says i dont think anybody could 
sing spirituals like the boys choir but even if the boys choir of 
vienna was doing the haydn te deum there will be a difference in 
overall feeling from the way well do it 
turnbull also places emphasis on the nonmusical opportunities 
for choir members 
tutoring in subjects ranging from english and mathematics to 
music theory is provided six days a week and some kids go to the 
choirs own school choir members must maintain a b average 
three fulltime counselors give yearround career family and 
adolescent counseling during the summer choir members attend day 
camp in new york city and a liveaway camp in the connecticut 
countryside 
the choir has received international rave reviews and barbara 
bush the presidents wife commented after a june 5 white house 
performance that the choirs program of allround care should be 
duplicated around the world 
but turnbull and his aides have trouble funding even the one 
operation 
despite some generous corporate donations the program is 
chronically short of money 300000 was lacking in may from a 
projected budget of 14 million although the choir is fully booked 
with paying performance dates 
turnbull says the staff does what it can despite financial 
difficulties and invoked the choirs slogan boys choir of harlem 
saves lives 
most of the children come from oneparent lowincome or welfare 
families and turnbull said the counselors often have their hands 
full 
there are problems within the family with siblings who might 
be dealing or messing with drugs or in some cases even parents 
he says poverty is the main problem it all boils down to poverty 
sometimes parental problems are so severe that they make it 
difficult to come to rehearsals every day and once they stop coming 
every day they kind of fall 
the boys also have to fight peer pressure from outsiders 
many kids are ribbed turnbull says but then their 
comeback is have you ever been to japan have you been to europe 
have you traveled to the caribbean 
there are all kinds of things that kids in the boys choir of 
harlem get to do that most kids would never get the chance to do

editors note he doesnt do ducks but when it comes to carving 
just about any other kind of bird larry barth is a recognized 
master of a craft most often associated with producing decoys for 
duck hunters barths birds are considered true works of art 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
larry barth is a heavyweight in a world 
where a gram of wood shavings fluttering onto his workbench can 
represent a hard days work 
he carves birds 
the sharp steel edges of barths chisels bite into blocks of 
basswood and tupelo and find song birds predators and game birds 
that possess an air of movement with that he is helping to 
transform wildfowl carving into something more than a sportsmens 
craft 
theres a tremendous interest in wildlife art and probably has 
been for the past 10 or 15 years says sam dyke immediate past 
president of the ward foundation a nonprofit arts and education 
organization which sponsors an international competition in ocean 
city md but its certainly not the kind of art that endures 
its maybe calendar art its not generally regarded as fine art 
larrys work is 
barth 31 works in a quiet welllighted shop in his home among 
hardwood forests and manicured farms in the laurel mountains 50 
miles east of pittsburgh 
he is usually at his bench from 8 am until 5 pm breaking for 
lunch and supper he often returns to work when the hubbub of 
evenings with his wife linda and their two young children 
dissolves into night 
for fun i go out and do brute force things that dont require a 
lot of precision splitting firewood or building stone walls around 
the place 
that feels really good after a day of removing a gram of wood 
from feathers the size of your fingernail 
barth prefers to carve song birds but is getting more mileage 
out of birds of prey 
im not into ducks he says 
some people are a decoy of a pintail carved by elmer crowell of 
massachusetts was auctioned several years ago for a record 319000 
that was probably an aberration in an emerging and unsettled 
market says curtis badger editor of wildfowl art the ward 
foundations quarterly magazine 
the ward foundation purchases each years winning entry for 
20000 but antique decoys are where the big money is 
you have to do what you know barth says what i know about 
are song birds upland game birds and birds of prey 
before lifting a knife or a chisel barth studies the bird he 
plans to carve he reads books examines pictures and museum 
exhibits and watches them in life often at a birdbanding station 
that carnegie museum operates a half mile from his house 
after the drawing comes the critical rendering in clay 
once i have the clay model done as far as im concerned the 
piece is done he says the toughest decisions i make are in the 
clay after that its just technical executionthe noodling out of 
the detail 
carving the wood can be grueling gluing blocks of wood together 
and roughly shaping them with chisels is followed by the tedium of 
carving the feathers detailing each down to the space between the 
barbs 
im dealing with the top onesixteenth of an inch of the 
wood he says 
he chars the wood with an electrically heated blade to create the 
distinct hard feathers of the tail and wings and he grinds the 
wood to create the loose soft feathers of the body 
barth established himself as a new force in the field with 
backtoback world class titles at ocean city 
he won in 1985 with a formidable and confident snowy owl at 
rest smugly clutching a limp bonaparte gull barth repeated the 
next year with a pair of airborne terns one flaring its tail and 
wingtips the other tucking a wing and arching its tail as the two 
birds bank left in tight formation 
most recently barth received a commission from the prestigious 
leigh yawkey woodson art museum in wausau wis 
the woodson museum a general art museum with a specialty 
collection of wildlife art is paying barth an undisclosed sum for a 
carving of his choice indulging his preference for robust chunky 
birds barth is carving a tern being chased by two jaegers the 
blackhooded bullies of the seashore 
hes showing situations that seem almost impossible to present 
given the medium says kathy foley director of the woodson 
museum larry is a maverick a marvel a master hes carved 
circles around people whove been carving longer than larrys been 
alive 
the woodson commission is the latest in a series of honors barth 
has received since he jumped into the spotlight at age 21 with a 
family of great horned owls that won second place at the 1979 ward 
competition 
until then he had carved in isolation making his own tools and 
developing his own techniques after being drawn to the craft through 
his fathers interest in wood carving and his mothers interest in 
bird watching 
barth was in the ninth grade when he carved his first bird a 
thumbsize attempt at a rufoussided towhee he still has the black 
brown and white carving 
a series of birds emerged from a sugar pine plank from the 
familys picnic table barth sold many of his early carvings to 
florists and others to use as decorations 
cornell university accepted him to study ornithology but barth 
realized at the last minute that he didnt care how a birds liver 
works only what the bird looks like he entered carnegie mellon 
university to prepare for a career in illustration carving remained 
his hobby 
he later redefined his major to carving

jeffrey jones calls his first television 
series the people next door a light romantic comedy with a 
subversive twist 
in the cbs show jones plays a successful cartoonist named walter 
kellogg who has a new wife two kids and a powerful imagination the 
latter figures heavily in the stories because everything he imagines 
springs to life 
i became a cartoonist because things in my imagination suggest 
cartoons to me jones says but its not cartooncie allen 
so welcome kathy najimy and mo gaffney in their latest enterprise 
as stars of offbroadways eminently successful the kathy and mo 
show parallel lives 
they play teenagers retired women angels in heaven lonely 
folks in a bar sometimes even men 
but theyre not just after laughs 
mo says we get letters from people who say the show made them 
think and it just makes some people happy im not saying every 
scene we do has a message 
kathy says even our two alcoholics in the country bar we see 
the fun in them and the reality of them and think theyre not too 
different from us thats a fun piece to do 
but there is meaning and respect here too as the humorous 
miniplays roll off their stereotypical subjects for instance a 
couple of unsophisticated older women going back to college 
discrimination for sexes and races as a whole has bothered me 
forever and will continue to until its gone mo says this is 
pretty much what we have to say 
kathy adds if were feeling particularly concerned with 
womens selfesteem or how women and men think theyre supposed to 
be and how we go about fulfilling that thats going to pour out in 
our work society is obsessed with telling women how theyre 
supposed to be under the auspices of being more liberated it is 
just another set of rules i think we waste a lot of time when we 
could just be living 
when theyre creating mo says scenes begin with a character 
or an issue or a situation its easiest to build around characters 
i think you know what theyd do and say and what situation theyd 
be in 
a san diego native whose parents are from beirut kathy najimy 
studied acting and directing at san diego state i had no thought 
of being in a duo she says i was in feminist theater sisters 
on stage in college i was a director in san diego was in tons of 
musicals i have an alto belting voice i got tired of that real 
quick i did a couple of serious plays 
i directed teenagers in a stage show that got brought to tv 
and won two emmys i did a onewoman show its my party did a 
bit of standup at the comedy store in los angeles for five years 
i was always in something 
then kathy and mo met in 1982 and wrote some skits for the 
kathy and mo show after a planned evening performance for 
friends the show played the old town theater in san diego then 
dont tell mama here in 1986 the further adventures of kathy and 
mo opened at the second stage theater here then toured kathy and 
mo added some skits and opened the present version at the westside 
arts theater on jan 31 
now weve got tv film and book offers were thinking about 
kathy says we might move to oregon and open a laundromat 
and sadly they might go separate directions for awhile kathy 
wants to direct and perform in other things mo has been writing a 
screenplay and would like to write for and act in films 
mo gaffney named maureen by her mother who thought maureen 
couldnt be nicknamed at 18 received stationary from a friend 
emblazoned messages from moface mo stuck 
i was in a feminist improv group hot flashes for a long 
time she says we played womens festivals im like a grownup 
feminist now i always wanted to be an actor writing came almost 
from having to so you dont always have to audition for somebody 
elses play 
i was a funny little kid it was easy to be in my family we 
didnt sit around the piano and sing but we had great lines shooting 
back and forth 
kathy who met her boyfriend painter and pianist john boswell 
here says were very different most of the time the difference 
is wonderful sometimes its a problem i loved new york right away 
mo didnt adjust to it too well and does not want to live here 
mo says i keep the books kathy talks to people goes to 
business meetings i type the scripts and do the correspondence i 
like working on my word processor shes more outgoing i like 
keeping things in order 
the only thing were the same on is writing thats where we 
merge best one of us comes up with an initial idea therell be a 
certain amount of discussion and rewriting this show is almost 
exactly 5050 as far as writing is concerned 
kathy says that the hardest scene to play is one in which three 
sisters meet i play two of them theyre normal women our age 
our economic bracket its not like one has a southern accent they 
cant be that different its really difficult to find subtle 
differences of people much like myself 
it is easier to find truth in the dramatic parts comedy is 
truth plus timing plus facial expressions

twelve years ago sunday an unlovely 
collection of human engineering named voyager 2 broke free of the 
earths gravity and started a long tour of the solar system 
the spacecraft has cruised the rings of saturn observed 
jupiters great red spot watched volcanos erupt on its moon io and 
discovered clandestine moons circling neptune 
and in that blink of cosmic time there have been changes for 
voyagers creators and handlers those who built it and shepherded 
it across space marking its 4 billionmile course in human 
milestones 
theres people who remember their childrens birthdays in terms 
of where the spacecraft was weve had people get married and people 
who died during the mission said charles kohlhase the mission 
design manager for voyager there are going to be a lot of people 
who have been loyal to this project who are going to be sad when its 
over 
the sad day is coming after a close encounter with neptune this 
week that promises another set of spectacular pictures from a 
distant planet voyager 2 will continue on its way out of the solar 
system at 37000 miles an hour becoming the manmade object that 
has traveled the farthest from mother earth 
voyager 2 was launched on aug 20 1977 its sister ship voyager 
1 launched sept 5 1977 has been cruising through an empty part 
of the solar system following a 1981 flyby of saturn 
only a skeleton crew of technicians will monitor the voyagers as 
they continue to sniff deep space for information looking for the 
heliopause the zone where the suns influence on the solar system 
ends 
with enough plutonium to keep their electronics running another 
28 years the gangly 1700pound creations resembling failed erector 
sets will likely outlive the humans who built them and whose 
signatures and the names of their families are etched on thin 
sheets of titanium bolted into the spacecrafts side 
everybody in my family feels connected to whats happened with 
voyager said ray heacock the deputy assistant director at the 
jet propulsion laboratory who oversaw development of voyager ive 
worked on a lot of other projects but this is my baby 
and others baby as well thousands of people in dozens of 
companies and universities across the country helped design and 
build the sturdy spacecrafts 
it was tremendously exciting and satisfying to be involved in 
the project said james mcanally who led the denverbased martin 
mariettas efforts to develop voyagers guidance system and 
planetary radio receiver 
at jpl there are constant reminders of voyager hallways and 
offices are adorned with its pictures from jupiter and saturn like 
the artwork of a favorite child the facilitys closedcircuit 
television system offers updates about the progress of the mission 
yet voyager is a success story that almost wasnt 
originally envisioned as an ambitious and expensive grand 
tour of the outer solar system by four spacecraft the plan was 
scrubbed in 1972 as the nation sated with moon flights turned its 
attention away from the space program 
instead nasa dropped the idea of visiting uranus and neptue with 
a new spacecraft and built two souped up versions of the proven 
mariner design for a mission to only jupiter and saturn 
but scientists hoped it still might be possible to send one of 
the spacecraft on to uranus and neptune by using gravitational 
fields of the giant planets to bend voyagers trajectory like a 
billiard ball in a cushion shot 
when it became apparent voyager 2 could make the grand tour 
scientists had to improvise with its aging technology while the 
spacecraft has 5 million electronic parts the equivalent of 2000 
color tv sets it has only a quarter the computing power of todays 
personal computers 
so voyager 2s onboard computers were reprogrammed from across 
space to compress its bursts of data a new tracking system was 
devised for its cameras to ensure clear detailed pictures despite 
the increasing transmission distance to earth and the feebler light 
at the end of the solar system 
more tracking dishes were added in the deserts of california and 
new mexico and in australia spain and japan to capture voyagers 
weak radio signals that have spread and diffused over the billions 
of miles 
weve done things with it that we havent done with any other 
system said heacock 
this technological creativity would have gone wanting if the 
spacecrafts key equipment broke down there have been what heacock 
calls cliffhangers one radio that received earth communications 
blew a fuse another became deaf to some frequencies voyager 2s 
computer lost some memory and a platform that scans the planets gets 
stuck if it moves too fast 
yet everything else has continued to work despite a dozen years 
of the absolute heat and cold of space and bursts of radiation from 
jupiter 1000 times the lethal dose for a human 
even though the voyagers have total redundancy basically 
two of everything the odds of making it this far were considered 
slim 
the scientists had data on the reliability of the spacecrafts 
components and said heacock none of those numbers that we used 
had us operating at this point 
kohlhase credited the human factor i hate to sound trite but 
the people involved with the design of the spacecraft were 
motivated talented creative people he said the reliability 
is the result of those creative energies 
heacock and kohlhase say they dont think of the voyagers as 
living beings and yet said kohlhase we all feel affection for 
them 
its sort of like were connected to these machines they are 
not human but they are extensions of our human qualities 
kohlhase bears a strong resemblance to star treks mr spock and 
has gone to costume parties dressed as the science fiction 
character now 53 he was 39 when he began working on voyager in 
the time of voyager he survived major surgery for cancer of the 
thyroid 
i was able to schedule it between the two saturn encounters 
he said laughing 
also in the time of voyager he saw his two daughters grow from 
teenagers into lives of their own he now has a grandson whose 
picture shares a spot on the office wall with images from space 
i look forward to the time when im an old man telling my 
grandchildren my name is on a spacecraft escaping from the solar 
system to travel in the core of the milky way he said

the national conscience about the vietnam war is explored once 
more in brian depalmas shocking new film casualties of war 
again american soldiers are the villains of the piece and the 
tragedy is heightened by the realization that the events actually 
happened 
the film is based on 1969 reportage for new yorker magazine by 
daniel lang he wrote about a detail of soldiers who were sent on a 
routine reconnoitering mission the veteran sergeant in command 
meserve all of the actual names were changed decided they would 
take along some portable rampr he led the group to a native 
village where they abducted a young woman 
the soldiers and their captive established a camp at a native 
hut where they raped her all participated some with reluctance 
all except a vietnam newcomer eriksson he was appalled by what he 
saw and tried unsuccessfully to help the girl escape 
meserve led the soldiers and the girl into combat and decided she 
had to be killed to destroy any evidence the deed was willingly 
performed by the radio man clark after a fierce battle the detail 
returned to camp where eriksson decided to tell what happened to 
his astonishment the brass seemed willing to let the rapemurder be 
forgotten 
finally eriksson reached high enough authority to bring action 
the resulting court martial convicted the four major participants in 
the crime and erikssons testimony made him a pariah among his 
fellow soldiers 
david rabes script faithfully follows the events of langs 
article notable exception the four were tried individually 
depalma is expert at intense stomachchurning action and he deftly 
contrasts the brutality of war with the lush beauty of the jungle 
landscapes actually thailand 
the film is told in retrospect as the civilian erikssons 
nightmare returns while he studies an oriental girl on an urban 
train apparently rabe and depalma felt that such a framing was 
necessary but it doesnt work the conclusion is a puzzling letdown 
casualties of war stars michael j fox as eriksson and sean 
penn as meserve fox is ideal as the innocent of the squad his 
growing toughness and his moral indignation add credulity to the 
plot oddly penn is a disappointment the warhardened sergeant 
would seem tailormade for an actor of his intensity but penn never 
gets a firm handle on meserve and much of his dialogue is garbled 
by his constant tobacco chewing 
the columbia pictures release was produced by art linson the 
rating is r for the rape scene and a vast amount of soldierly 
swearing running time 120 minutes

whisper to a scream virgin vision vhsbeta 7995 rated r 
 
whisper to a scream is an ordinary movie about serial 
murders in this case the victims are nightclub dancers who get 
sliced and diced by the sleazy joints weirdo disc jockey 
its a an amateurish production at best and one wonders why such 
a distinguished actor as yaphet kotto would want to be in it he 
plays the police detective assigned to solve the murders 
the dancers are supposedly artist types but they do tend to take 
off their clothes a lot in addition there are sexual situations 
strong language and of course violence as the women are strangled 
and stabbed 
nadia capone plays a struggling young actress who gives up a 
promising part to stay with her painterlover silvio oliviero to 
make ends meet she works in a backroom of the nightclub talking 
suggestively to guys who apparently like to pay for obscene 
telephone calls including the weirdo deejay who likes to record 
the sounds of the dying females for his ultimate muscial 
composition he thinks of capone as his muse 
as he begins to stalk her as his final victim she suspects her 
lover of rubbing out her coworkers 
all in all the movie looks like it was slapped together by a 
group of unemployed actors and actresses who decided to make a movie 
over the weekend with rented equipment in someones loft

land before time mca home video vhsbeta 2495 rated g 
 
the land before time is one of the few animated childrens 
features of recent years that can hold a candle to the old walt 
disney classics no surprise that its primarily the creation of don 
bluth who worked for disney before he left to start his own company 
the film tells the simple story of littlefoot a lovable baby 
brontosaurus who must make his way from his homeland which is 
being wracked by earthquakes and volcanoes to a green oasis known 
as the great valley 
along the way littlefoot is separated from his grandparents 
sees his mother killed fights off the villainous sharptooth and 
makes friends with other young creatures of varying shapes and 
species 
bluth and his coproducers john pomeroy and gary goldman manage 
to make these primordial characters appealing without being 
sickeningly cute the animation is inventive and the dramatic scenes 
like the big earthquake or sharptooths attack extremely vivid 
very young children may be frightened by these parts and upset by 
the mothers death but aside from that caution this is that rare 
film that can honestly be recommended for viewers of all ages it 
even holds up under repeated watching

the first solo on in step is taken by pianist reese wynans 
thats a surprise but it underscores the fact that stevie ray 
vaughans blues guitar is not the records sole raison detre 
french for reason to be purchased 
vaughans guitar is a remarkably expressive instrument true but 
in step offers even more 
wynans drummer chris layton and bassist tommy shannon play with 
the same fire as the star horns on two cuts add further punch 
the tunes are nicely varied from boogiewoogie the house is 
rockin to shuffle tightrope to slow 12bar blues buddy 
guys leave my girl alone two instrumentals also alter the 
pace and the sassysounding scratch n sniff with vaughan 
showing he can sing as fast as he plays justifies the inclusion of 
a lyrics sheet 
vaughan belongs on any list of the best popular contemporary 
bluesmen his music is as gritty as george thorogoods yet as 
graceful as robert crays and what a guitarist

add her fat tone seamless lines and fine musicianship to the 
superlative audubon and the result is an excellent disc woods 
rich round sound unburdened by a heavy vibrato blends perfectly 
with the quartet all are equals if any fault can be found it is 
that ms woods is sometimes on the nonchalant side when the music 
needs a little more heat 
the program is coherent the pieces were composed between 1922 
and 1932 all inspired by the great english oboist leon goossens 
the baxblissbritten order moves from less tonal complexity to 
more the pieces most in the bax and least in the britten have 
elements of british folk tunes and all revel in a richness of 
texture 
bax also a poet who published under the name dermot obyrne was 
enamored of ireland and travelled widely there the quintets folk 
melodies most apparent in the last movement bear out that bit of 
biography the piece has a lush quality and reminds one of the ravel 
string quartet doris lederers viola solos are particularly 
beautiful 
bliss a world war i veteran succeeded bax as master of the 
queens music and his quintet sounds inspired by the bax work his 
variety of colors is greater and brittens even greater still 
britten was 18 when he finished his phantasy it is one of his 
earliest mature works

world war ii pilot robert morgan who 
flew the renowned american b17 flying fortress bomber called the 
memphis belle is pleased matthew modine is playing a character 
based on him in a new movie but he thinks the actor has one thing 
to learn 
ive got to get matthew a little bit more egotistical morgan 
chuckled referring to the star of memphis belle which retraces 
the 25th and last mission in 1943 of that b17 and the 10 men who 
flew it 
the movie budgeted at 206 million began its 10week shoot in 
britain july 17 modine the 30yearold star of full metal 
jacket and birdy costars with eric stoltz mask some 
kind of wonderful who is the radio operator and db sweeney 
eight men out as the navigator 
john lithgow the original star of m butterfly on broadway 
plays the public relations officer who views the memphis belle 
mission as a chance to boost both war bond sales and sagging morale 
michael catonjones the glaswegian filmmaker who made 
scandal directs from a screenplay by monte merrick the film is 
coproduced by catherine wyler daughter of the movie director 
william wyler and david puttnam the british producer of chariots 
of fire and the mission 
memphis belle is due for release in the united states in 
september 1990 and in britain one month later 
it is puttnams first movie project since he finished a 
muchpublicized hollywood spell as chairman and chief executive of 
columbia pictures two years ago and the 48yearold puttnam hopes 
it will counter films such as the 1986 blockbuster top gun 
which he said glorified air combat 
i couldnt work out what that film was about other than men 
zooming around the skies he said in an interview on the set at an 
abandoned royal air force base in binbrook lincolnshire 180 miles 
northeast of london i was wondering if it was possible to take 
the technical qualities of top gun and use them in a dramatic film 
about human beings 
puttnam said he was inspired by a 1944 documentary by william 
wyler about the memphis belle wyler flew in the bomber five times 
to get the footage 
that was unashamedly a propaganda film made for a job but it 
did its job rather well said puttnam we all agreed it was the 
basis for a really good film 
memphis belle relates 24 hours before the bombers final 
mission a successful raid over bremen in northwest germany the 
aircraft was then brought back to the united states where the same 
10member crew flew it across the country as a propaganda exercise 
in may 1987 it was restored and is now on display in memphis 
in the film five b17s were used for the flying sequences one 
crashed during filming july 25 injuring two technicians none of 
the stars was aboard 
the characters in the movie are fictionalized versions of the 
original crew eight of whom are still alive and were flown to the 
lincolnshire location to help promote the movie 
eugene adkins an original memphis belle gunner now living in 
johnson city tenn said the onset visit was like christmas to 
us i never dreamed it would ever happen again 
robert hansen the crews original radio operator said eric 
stoltzs equivalent character in the movie undergoes a more 
difficult ordeal than hansen did in the actual mission 
they have a tough time bringing eric through said hansen 
who lives in mesa ariz by contrast hansen said he was a zigger 
and a zagger when they were shooting at me i zigged and when the 
bullets went by i zagged so they didnt hit me 
stoltz said he was enjoying the challenge 
this is a completely new arena for me which is what i really 
enjoy about being an actor it gives me a chance to playact said 
the 27yearold actor a tony nominee for his performance last 
season in the lincoln center revival of thornton wilders our 
town 
it gives me a chance to be in the military which is something 
i would never do in reality said stoltz who spent what he called 
an egobashing week with the rest of the cast at a training camp 
in dartmoor in southern england 
stoltz said the enduring rapport of the real memphis belle 
veterans was an inspiration its fun to see a group of men still 
glad to be alive still loving life and theyre 70

matthew modine has been widely acclaimed 
as one of americas best young film actors but the star of 
married to the mob birdy and now memphis belle says 
good screen roles are hard to find 
its just so hard to find something you want to work on he 
said over lunch during a break in filming memphis belle 
when theres something good around everyone knows about it 
the 30yearold actor increasingly has been getting a sizable 
share of whats good though the californiaborn modine has appeared 
in flops such as vision quest and mrs soffel hes best 
known for starring in two attentiongrabbing films about the vietnam 
war alan parkers birdy and stanley kubricks full metal 
jacket 
movies he said have a responsibility to their audiences so he 
is selective 
maybe if i were in straitened circumstances i wouldnt be 
able to choose he said but fortunately i can afford not to 
work theres so much garbage you read that is repetitious 
modine said he was drawn to memphis belle by its tale of 10 
ordinary men who are transformed into heroes memphis belle 
relates 24 hours before the celebrated bombers final mission a 
successful raid over bremen in northwest germany the aircraft was 
then brought back to the united states where the same 10member 
crew flew it across the country as a propaganda exercise in may 
1987 it was restored and is now on display in memphis 
the propaganda machine said these guys did it so they must be 
extraordinary human beings he said in fact they werent they 
were just the ones who did it 
he said the film was a das boot in the air referring to 
the 1981 german movie about a world war ii uboat mission 
next up modine will be seen as a medical student who falls in 
love with his teacher played by christine lahti in thom 
eberhardts gross anatomy beyond that he is interested in 
making a film that links aids to a conspiracy by the world health 
organization 
theres enough proof that the who asked for it he said 
adding that the film as yet untitled and unwritten would be 
similar in tone to the 1979 hit movie about a nuclear accident 
the china syndrome 
its quite frightening if it the disease was commissioned 
if this is what happened with aids then the ramifications are 
huge modine said

danny ransom spent the first six months of 
his career tediously making deformed electric guitars for 10 each 
today he creates nearperfect instruments veritable works of 
art that sell for as much as 4000 to a list of clients that 
includes some of the worlds bestknown musicians 
the average largescale guitar manufacturer can produce one 
guitar body and a dozen guitar necks in about seven minutes but a 
craftsman such as ransom spends several days sometimes weeks on a 
single instrument 
these huge companies pour out these glossy ads that say we 
build the most perfect machine in the world and most of their 
stuff is junk he says ive had to make sure every instrument 
is right 
ransom 36 has been in the guitarbuilding business 13 years he 
has built guitars for members of the grateful dead santana and 
alabama laurie anderson and jean luc ponty play 4000 synthesizer 
violins he made for a company called zeta 
experimental guitarist henry kaiser bought one of ransoms 
stratocasterstyle guitars last year from a friend he says ransom 
understands the complexities of the instrument and how the different 
parts interact 
hes very sensitive to all those things that go beyond most 
guitar makers kaiser said its just a versatile expressive 
instrument 
an independent contractor ransom works out of a sawdustfilled 
studio adjacent to real guitars a collectors guitar store 
there was a time when he was low man on the guitarmaker totem 
pole he first worked for a huge custom guitar manufacturer now 
defunct initially building what he calls the worst garbage 
then 23 he was hired because one of the staff builders had a 
habit of taking lsd lysergic acid diethylamide on the job and 
talking to the tools 
the day the bandsaw turned into a serpent was the day i was 
brought in ransom recalls they stuck me in a room with a bunch 
of tools handed me a guitar and said make these 
his first guitars took weeks to build and earned him a whopping 
10 each they were stacked up and sold as seconds or thrown out 
one particular guitar stands out in his memory it was the first 
time hed completed a carved top for a les paulstyle guitar the 
final touches required a butane torch and one of his bosses decided 
to show him how it was done 
at first it got these little red embers like little coals 
burning on it ransom recalls i said do you know what youre 
doing he said shut up of course i do then the glue line 
started to lift off and the thing burst into flames right in front 
of us 
if you can imagine putting out a fire with coffee cups 
this is like watching your child burn 
things started to pick up after other builders began teaching 
him ransom says the difference between a good guitar and a bad 
guitar lies in the details such as the curves in the wood and 
placement of the finger board and joints 
theres a real learning that goes on with figuring out detail 
the better you can adapt your eye to detail the better you will get 
at whatever you do in terms of craft thats really what i got from 
some of the people who helped me early on 
his guitars usually stratocaster and telecaster styles are made 
mostly from alder ash and maple ransom often visits lumber yards 
armed with density and moisture meters to find the right wood soft 
woods such as mahogony tend to give off more midrange sound while 
harder woods such as poplar produce the higher treble sounds he 
has ebony shipped from india rosewoods from brazil and swamp ash 
from louisiana 
ransom traces the guitar bodies and necks on templates bandsaws 
them out then screws the templates back on he runs the body off on 
a pinrouter last instruments are shaped and sanded and the elbows 
and bellys are cut by hand 
as a lithography major at san francisco state in the 1970s 
ransom had planned to become a cabinetmaker prior to that his 
experience working with wood was building matchstick holders and 
other goofy little things when he was a cub scout 
although he is an admitted deadhead grateful dead fan 
ransom is not much of a musician he sees that as more of an asset 
than a liability for an electric guitar and violin maker 
the guitar builders who have an understanding of music but 
arent players tend to be much more versatile in their building and 
are much more involved in the quality of their instrument not just 
the sound or the playability but the overall quality

being on the road is nothing new for gloria 
estefan who was just a baby when her family fled from cuba 
for 10 years she and miami sound machine toured the world 
attracting millions of listeners with the sounds of salsa samba and 
conga with a string of hit singles including rhythm is gonna get 
you and the no 1 anything for you the schedule moves at the 
pace of their hottest music 
but they do take a breather on occasion to sing a slow song on 
stage enjoy the sunshine of their adopted city or record another 
album 
we tried to arrange the album the way we try to do a show 
estefan said of their new record cuts both ways a collection 
of dance songs and ballads 
you try to get a feeling we really focused on how we could 
make the people relax have moments in the show to settle back and 
then build it to a party atmosphere 
with their crossover ability beyond question miami sound machine 
has decided to step back a bit on cuts both ways performing two 
songs in spanish and adding a stronger latin beat 
this band has spent two years touring together said estefan 
whose husband emilio founded the group and now produces their 
records all the songs are ours it was arranged by us it was 
coproduced by emilio and two of the guys in the band it was the 
first time we had the opportunity to do that 
we felt freer on this record the latin music is interwoven 
into our songs a lot more one song get on your feet is not 
latin at all but has a latin break in the middle 
what concerns estefan more than anything else is the increasing 
tendency to refer to the group as gloria estefan and miami sound 
machine or just gloria estefan she has no desire to follow 
the path of pop stars such as diana ross and deborah harry who left 
their bands behind to pursue a solo career 
if you were to pinpoint what miami sound machine is it would 
be emilio estefan said it was a musical idea he had all along 
the only original member is me the sound that was produced in the 
studio was emilios 
she grew up glorita fajardo the shy daughter of a former 
bodyguard for the wife of deposed cuban dictator fulgencio batista 
music was at that time literally a dream she would imagine 
herself on stage dressed in black picking up thick black coils 
i was into music almost when i started talking i would learn 
all these songs and sing them she said 
she impressed relatives with her ability to memorize poetry and 
was soon writing her own as a teenager she and her cousin would 
strum guitars and sing at high school assemblies 
i was staring at the floor because my friends would want me to 
do it they would hound me to death wed be at home and my mom 
would drag out my guitar for her firends and id sing 
emilio estefan was a popular local musician leader of the 
miami latin boys when he helped gloria and some friends put 
together a show for her parents 
she was finishing high school at the time and heard little of him 
until his band played at a wedding attended by gloria and her family 
i didnt want to go my mother dragged me she recalled 
they were playing and he said i remember you and asked me to 
sing some songs with the band who hated to have anyone sit in 
we did two standards and what a difference a day makes i 
just followed along i have a good ear and we got a standing ovation 
because everybody knew me since i was a child 
she had thoughts of majoring in psychology but eventually agreed 
to join estefans band estefan can still remember the date of their 
first concert oct 25 1975 when stage fright kept her from doing 
little more than shake maracas 
while miamis kc and the sunshine band dominated the pop 
charts miami sound machine took hold of the spanish market 
starting with their very first single the ballad renacer 
they spent the next decade as the worlds only arenawedding band 
wed go to latin america and play huge stadiums 50000 people 
and then wed go back to miami and play a wedding maybe 300 
people estefan said 
we were on latin radio and little by little maybe because 
they could identify with the way i worded things we became more 
popular parents started saying their kids were listening to our 
music even though they hated latin music 
pop success started in early 1986 with the top 10 single 
conga and hasnt let up perserverance she says is the secret 
also the songs like the ballad dont wanna lose you off cuts 
both ways 
we played the song for the cousin of someone in the band she 
was a high school student coming up for a school paper she came in 
while we were mixing it and sat down by the end of the song she 
was crying i thought thats it the tear test

author mary kay blakely learned a lot about life 
during the nine days she hovered near death in a coma 
with the help of her friends and family she revived and with 
their assistance and with her own vivid recollections she has 
pieced together a travelogue of her journey through the dream state 
commencing on march 23 1984 
when her lover larry tried to wake her that morning she 
discovered she had no contact with her eyelids further 
experiments proved that i couldnt swallow or move my limbs clear 
my throat or clasp my hand 
when he spoke or touched me i heard and felt him but couldnt 
speak or touch in return but in the benevolent atmosphere of my 
dream i felt more curiosity than alarm if i could claim any 
feelings at all blakely writes in her new book wake me when 
its over times books 1795 
it was as though i were sitting alone in the back of a huge 
auditorium for a private unedited screening of my life it was 
strange to watch familiar scenes without feeling the attendant 
embarrassment or anger or joy they usually inspired 
doctors said her coma was caused by diabetes surgery and other 
medical problems but blakely a freelance writer whose work 
appeared among the new york times hers columns and in national 
magazines says it was triggered by divorce severe financial 
strain her brothers suicide and the hectic lifestyle of the 
1980s 
i cannot recommend a coma as a cure for depression and 
stress she said in my case it did solve a lot of problems 
but i like to think that there are other less damaging routes to 
the same information 
the warning signals were there everybody in my life could see 
that i was exhausted but i think we start to look at women as if 
being exhausted is a normal state for them she said we have 
forgotten what normal looks like and feels like 
the coma jolted her loved ones into action she says her bubbly 
eccentric sister gina literally talked her into living her 
feminist friends united in an energy circle to bring her out of 
orbit 
later they helped fill in the details as she reconstructed the 
experience and perhaps because there was no brain damage she awoke 
with a clear recollection of my dreams the almost hallucinatory 
moments of the coma as in all dreams you feel certain stimulation 
and your mind kind of spins out 
she wrote about the hallucinations and the things she heard 
i knew i was in a hospital because i heard two of the staff 
members talking over my head about how hard it was to live in new 
york city on a residents income but i didnt always interpret what 
was going on rationally she said 
sounds and voices i identified as real actions real people 
would suddenly melt into the bizarre plots and characters of surreal 
dreams she wrote it was as though my brain were leaking badly 
bleeding fact into fiction until reality was as unreliable as a 
melting dali timepiece 
far in the distance i heard the light chatter of female voices 
conversing coffeebreak style above the low broadcast of a radio 
a four oclock traffic report warned commuters about delays in the 
holland and lincoln tunnels and i made a mental note to avoid those 
routes on the way home 
she recalled hospital workers parting her hair and applying a 
paste before a brain activity test it was the most amazing 
thing she remembered thinking this was the weirdest goddamn 
prison after they suctioned your lungs they frizzed your hair 
i suppose the favorite part of it was once i was able to 
comprehend this material thats when my sense of humor returned 
she said in an interview 
as she awoke she was confused to see an incongruous assortment 
of family and friends including one from alaska at her bedside 
maybe we were all in juneau alaska reaching the end of an 
allnight pig roast she thought everyone looked slightly 
intoxicated smiling with nonsensical joy but showing visible signs 
of wear it must have been some wild party i wasnt feeling all 
that hot myself 
she has since reflected on the feelings of love and wellbeing 
the mysterious light that beckoned her through the coma 
here i am an agnostic having what is the equivalent of a 
spiritual experience she said 
was it the drugs she and her doctors dont know and my 
feeling now is that is the state we reach near death 
its completely altered my feelings about death i dont regard 
it any more as a terrifying alternative to life she said 
without any contact with my body i still existed as thought its 
a very comforting notion that whatever is uniquely human about us 
continues to exist 
the experience helped her deal with her brothers death gripped 
by manic depression frank blakely had killed himself leaving 
behind his writings 
the reason we have suffering he wrote is that progress 
can only be achieved at a price because goodness has to be made out 
of badness and the raw material has to be refined by fire and mixed 
with alloys before it can become strong 
those words inspired his sister in her own odyssey his 
experience with that illness and his real heroism in dealing with it 
he had this admirable courage and he was so able to articulate 
what his experience with madness was like was always valuable to 
me the author said

chris hillman considers the desert rose band the 
best band in which he has ever been 
in fact hed just as soon not even talk about the others 
including the most famous one the byrds which he and roger 
mcguinn founded just 25 years ago and the flying burrito brothers 
country music fans like the desert rose band too theyve made 
five straight singles go no 1 on the bestselling country chart 
and hello trouble is climbing toward the top 
the band also is nominated as vocal group of the year in the 
upcoming country music association awards for song of the year for 
i still believe in you and for the horizon award the 
associations highest honor 
hillman and mcguinn are nominated for country event of the year 
for a performance at red rocks in colorado their duet you aint 
going nowhere also is on the current country singles chart 
this band feels the best hillman says the others never 
felt right the byrds felt ok it was such a diverse group of 
individuals it selfdestructed this feels like the chemistry is 
right 
the six of us are trying to think alike trying to focus 
everybodys vision into one vision 
this has got the best players and singers it has proven itself 
with the chart singles were right on the track a man would be a 
fool to wreck this train give me a pen ive got a song title 
guitarist john jorgenson says in nashville everyone is a 
songwriter every third or fourth line of conversation somebody 
says that would be a good song 
in january hillman mcguinn and david crosby performed as the 
byrds in los angeles trying to trademark the name countering an 
attempt by the groups original drummer michael clarke to use it 
they talk about reforming the byrds hillman says i dont 
think that is going to happen the byrds would be wonderful to do if 
it didnt interfere with the desert rose band 
i love the other guys but i dont want to look over my 
shoulder this is something thats challenging right now it takes 
enough of my time just to keep abreast of the business and try and 
come up with something unique each time we jump into the studio 
after the byrds the flying burrito brothers stephen stills 
manassas southerhillmanfuray mcguinn clark amp hillman and time 
out for spiritual stocktaking hillman cut two solo country albums 
for sugar hill records morning sky and desert rose

before he and mcguinn created folkrock with the byrds and he and 
gram parsons pushed on into countryrock with the burritos 
you dont have to be from kentucky to hear country music 
hillman says in the 30s people came to california from 
appalachia the midwest and texas because of the dust bowl in world 
war ii came the aircraft industry and then the housing boom which 
attracted people from the southeast south and midwest they brought 
their music with them hence the real country music style from 
california 
in 1985 hillman formed a quartet to open shows for dan 
fogelberg he named it the desert rose band when he later added two 
more players making it an electric band with the ability to play 
acoustic 
desert rose was one of my songs hillman says it was a 
nickname for somebodys child i like the song ive been toying 
with the idea of recutting it with this bunch these guys can play 
and sing it better 
during a january 1986 booking at the palomino in north hollywood 
a curb records executive heard the band and later signed it the 
second lp on curb running came out last november curb is 
distributed by mca 
guitarist john jorgenson who was interviewed with hillman in 
mcas office says that the band early on performed songs from 
hillmans desert rose album 
hillman wrote most of the songs on running collaborating 
with steve hill a friend from ventura calif i write we work it 
out see how she flies he said 
hopefully it retains the personality of the band jorgenson 
said youve got the same six guys playing it putting their ideas 
and feelings into it on our latest single weve been hearing that 
people listening to it say that must be the desert rose band 
other band members are guitarist herb pedersen jay dee maness on 
pedal steel bassist bill bryson and drummer steve duncan

six the talk now is of the giant five 
the firms deloitte haskins amp sells and touche ross amp co said 
sunday their partners had approved a merger that will create a 
worldwide firm with annual revenue of more than 4 billion 
the merger of the two agencies first announced last month is 
the second this year among elite us accounting firms reducing 
the socalled big eight by two in addition two more top firms are 
discussing a possible union

operations in a firm with worldwide revenue of 42 billion and 
domestic revenue of 2 billion that deal is completed and the new 
firm ernst amp young formally begins operations oct 1 
arthur anderson amp co and price waterhouse last month confirmed 
they are discussing merging to form the worlds largest accounting 
firm analysts said the firms plan three more weeks of confidential 
negotiations and the union is expected to go through 
analysts have attributed the merger wave in part to competition 
in europe leading to 1992 when the 12nation european economic 
community plans to implement a borderfree market 
a statement sunday by the firms said the partners of deloitte 
and touche ross the smallest of the old big eight approved the 
merger at separate meetings in dallas last week 
the new firm to be known as deloitte amp touche in the united 
states will have 20000 employees and projected 1989 revenue of 
nearly 2 billion domestically and 65000 employees and projected 
1989 revenue of more than 2 billion in 100 other countries 
this positions deloitte and touche near the top of the heap 
which is where neither one has ever been bowman said it will 
be interesting to see if they can continue to be the aggressive 
upstarts they have been 
touche ross is considered strongest in the far east with 
deloitte a major presence in europe 
internationally the new firm will be known as deloitte ross 
tohmatsu international it will draw on the expertise of japans 
largest audit firm tohmatsu awoki amp sanwa a member of the touche 
ross international organization 
partners outside the united states are expected to approve the 
merger in votes in the next two months the firms said 
despite their ranking at the bottom of the big eight deloitte 
and touche have posted the most rapid growth in recent years 
according to bowman their average individual worldwide revenue 
jumped more than 88 percent from 1985 to 1988 last year their 
worldwide growth averaged 26 percent compared with an 22 percent 
for the other big eight firms 
deloitte in 1988 had 820 million us revenue and 192 billion 
in international revenue while touche ross had 796 million us 
revenue and 184 billion in worldwide revenue 
deloittes audit clients include general motors kimberlyclark 
monsanto and procter amp gamble touche ross clients include american 
motors chrysler litton industries and pillsbury 
an andersenwaterhouse merger would create a firm with 5 
billion a year in projected worldwide revenue and 27 billion in 
projected us revenue displacing the new ernst amp young at the top

the federal aviation administration has received 
180000 from mcdonnell douglas corp as a civil penalty for 
failing to maintain its approved quality control program for md80 
jetliners the faas northwest mountain region office said 
on feb 24 1988 the faa cited mcdonnell douglas for allegedly 
violating federal aviation regulations by failing to incorporate a 
mandatory design change in the manufacture of 171 of its 
twinengine md80s payment of the fine was announced on friday 
the design change required the long beach calif plane builder 
to harden areas around the attachment holes of a doubler or 
reinforcing part for the planes upper anticollision light to 
prevent fatigue cracking the doubler strengthens the structure 
around the light and attaches the light housing to the airplane 
the hardening process called stess coining increases 
resistance to fatigue cracking guarding against possible 
strucutral failure and depressurization in flight the faa said 
the faa found fatigue cracking in doublers of earlier dc9 
airplanes and issued an airworthiness directive on dec 17 1985 
for all dc9s in service the directive ordered either stress 
coining of the doubler or repeated inspections for cracking after 
planes had 30000 flights 
at the same time the faa approved the design change to modify 
the doubler on all md80 airplanes in production the md80 is 
mcdonell douglass designation for latermodel dc9s 
since 120 md80s were produced and delivered without the 
required design change the faa has since revised the airworthiness 
directive to include those planes for repeated inspections or the 
doubler modification 
another 51 aircraft were produced without the modified doubler 
but the deficiency was discovered and corrected before they were 
delivered to customers 
the faa originally proposed a 200000 fine for mcdonnell 
douglas but faa spokesman david duff said that was reduced after 
the manufacturer showed it had complied with some provisions of the 
design change duff said the fine was received by the faa on aug 1

grain and soybean futures opened lower today on

the weak tone of early trading also reflected a lack of 
enthusiasm over last weeks agriculture department harvest figures

the consumer product safety commission announced today that four companies 
have agreed to recall approximately 
250000 hair dryers that the commission believes present a danger of electrocution 
in announcing the voluntary recall the commission said it estimates 
that 17 americans die each year of accidental electrocution 
by hair dryers usually when they are dropped into bathtubs 
anne graham acting chairman of the commission said that from eight 
to 10 of the victims are usually children often playing 
with the hair dryers as toys 
the firms and the hair dryers involved in the recall are mbr industries 
inc of miami fla maker of pomair pro 2100 and 1900 
mustang electronics inc of hallandale fla maker of mustang mu 2100 
major international inc of orange calif maker of major 
styling dryer model 1250 and china bazaar of san francisco minimate hair 
dryer and iron ds601 
the commission said all of the minimate dryers had been stopped in 
inventory before being sold to consumers 
consumers who purchased any of the other dryers can return them to 
the store where they bought them and receive a refund or 
replacement ms graham said 
in addition to recalling the hair dryers these firms have agreed 
to market only hair dryers which meet acceptable minimum 
safety levels she said this means that they are contacting their 
foreign suppliers and demanding a safer product 
david schmeltzer the commissions associate executive director for 
compliance and administrative litigation said virtually all 
hair dryers sold in the united states are imported 
he said the dryers that are being recalled fail to meet a voluntary 
standard laid down in 1987 that requires a device to avoid 
any fatal leakage of current when the dryer enters the water with the switch 
in the off position 
schmeltzer said there are still some 80 million hair dryers in the 
hands of consumers that do not meet this voluntary standard 
and the staff is contacting other firms seeking additional recalls 
most consumers have the erroneous idea that when a hair dryer is 
turned off it does not create an electrocution hazard 
schmeltzer said this is simply not the case

eastman kodak co chairman colby chandler testified today he knew that 
getting involved in instant photography 
could mean a lawsuit from competitor polaroid corp but he said he was 
convinced his company would win 
chandler testified in a us district court trial that will determin 
how much kodak owes polaroid for infringing on patents for 
instantdeveloping film 
asked if he had felt there was a chance kodaks introduction of an 
instant camera in the mid1970s could provoke a suit from 
polaroid chandler answered yes 
but he said i felt we had reduced the risk to such a low level it 
was not a major consideration 
an earlier federal court decision already established that kodak infringed 
on the patents of polaroid the massachusettsbased 
pioneer of instant photography 
polaroid is seeking 12 billion which would be a record award in a 
patent infringement suit while rochester nybased kodak 
has argued it should pay 177 million an amount equal to a royalty of 
5 percent on the cameras and film it sold from 1976 to 1985 
chandler testified before judge a david mazzone that kodaks corporate 
policies clearly state we will not knowingly violate 
or infringe another companys patents 
asked if he had any reason to believe that policy was violated when 
kodak entered the instant film business chandler said no 
i did not 
chandler said he relied on advice from the companys attorneys in deciding 
that kodaks product would not infringe on polaroids 
patents 
asked if he had any reason to believe at the time the advice was faulty 
chandler testified no i did not 
in may polaroid chairman william j mcclune jr testfied that polaroid 
and eastman kodak had a productive working relationship 
for decades with kodak making film for polaroid but that things soured 
in the late 1960s when polaroid introduced its sx70 camera 
kodak mcclune said was asked to produce the new complex negative 
that polaroid had developed for that instant color camera 
but he said kodak demanded a license from polaroid which would have allowed 
kodak to develop its own instant photography 
polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities in 
massachusetts 
mccune testified then that instant photography is polaroids bread 
and butter and that kodaks introduction of instant film 
and cameras cut deeply into his companys profits

after posting several increases in recent weeks 
the number of working oil and gas rigs in the nation declined by 16 
this week to total 858 baker hughes inc reports 
the rig count last week was 874 an increase of four from the 
previous week in the last 11 weeks the rig count has increased 
eight times 
a year ago the count totaled 940 baker hughes said monday 
the companys rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively producing 
oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
among major oil producing states oklahoma lost six rigs 
wyomings count was down by five and texas had a decrease of four 
new mexico and california each lost two and colorado lost one 
louisianas rig count was up for four north dakotas increased

the white house today backed away from a 
contention by president bushs budget director that the federal 
reserve board is inviting a recession by keeping interest rates too 
high 
our policy is to want continued economic growth with low 
inflation said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater we 
believe the economy is generally on that course at the present time 
and the fed is doing a good job 
the fed is aware of our policy objectives and we believe that 
they share our concern for continuing economic growth fitzwater 
added 
richard g darman the director of the office of management and 
budget sounded an alarm on central bank policy sunday 
im fearful that fed policymakers have been a little bit too 
concerned that things have been going well and that they may have 
been a bit too tight on interest rates darman said on nbcs 
meet the press 
if we do have a recession it will be because they have erred 
on the side of caution said darman i think its quite 
important that the fed appreciate that growth is indeed fundamental 
to the health of this economy and that they not become too obsessed 
with concern about things going well for too long 
darmans television interview prompted a humorous exchange 
between himself and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter today at a 
billsigning ceremony at the white house 
you were kind of ornery yesterday a smiling yeutter called 
across the room to darman what do you mean darman replied 
work on it a little bit more dick yeutter said i want to 
refinance my home 
fitzwater was careful not to criticize darman 
dick is the director of the office of management and budget 
the spokesman said he is a part of the economic team we share 
his thinking he shares our thinking but we think generally were 
on the right course here 
fed spokesman joseph coyne said the agency would have no comment 
on darmans assertions 
the us economy has posted a record peacetime expansion since 
emerging from the 198081 recession the fed began pushing interest 
rates up in march 1988 when it began sensing that inflationary 
pressures were building 
however the central bank changed course last june after 
detecting weakness in the economy and has made three modest moves 
since then to lower interest rates 
but darman called the moves insufficient saying i would say 
insofar as we are concerned about recession we should all worry a 
little bit about the fed 
i think that theres no reason for us to have a recession he 
said its not necessary if there is sensible management on the 
parts of ourselves and the fed 
darman said he has shared his views with greenspan and indicated 
he did not see the perceived problem as the fed chairmans alone 
i think were the bush administration under sensible 
management and its important not merely that chairman greenspan 
but the other members of the board and the policysetting federal 
open market committee that makes the crucial decisions on this 
be more attentive to the need to avoid tipping this economy into a 
recession he said

a country is known by the numbers it keeps and 
some of those numbers of late suggest mystery hope and a growing 
health consciousness 
these are not the usual economic numbers that relate to gross 
national product and retail sales and productivity but they 
certainly have a lot to say about the present and future for those 
who can figure them out 
the first set of numbers the mystery numbers involve the 
automotive industrys hopes of raising prices in spite of customer 
resistance sales this year are likely to be lower than those of 
last year and sales next year might be lower again 
moreover companies have been forced to spur sales this year with 
rebates and belowmarket interest rates whenever the incentives 
came off sales came down without incentives the sales decline 
might have been worse 
as matters stand auto and light truck sales this year are likely 
to fall as much as 5 percent bringing the total to under 15 
million few forecasters expect improvement next year some see a 
fall to 143 million 
under such conditions you might expect sellers to restrain their 
pricing policies to keep prices low in order to attract customers 
but that isnt so general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
corp seem ready to raise rather than lower prices 
has the law of supply and demand been upset perhaps not but 
customers may be nobody likes to be confused especially customers 
contemplating one of the biggest expenses of their lifestyles they 
hardly can be blamed 
as matters stand they find it impossible to compare one years 
prices with another years because items that were extra one year 
are standard the next or vice versa and even if base price is 
unchanged net price can rise sharply 
even if prices do rise substantially however it is conceivable 
a customer might pay less if he or she has the patience and good 
timing to obtain the best discount or rebate or belowmarket 
interest rate but who can say 
it might actually be easier today to get a rough idea of the 
market price of an entire auto company than just one of its cars by 
multiplying the number of shares by the pershare price listed in 
the newspaper 
the numbers are clearer and offer more hope for americans in 
regard to another aspect of life the amount of time spent watching 
television the japanese it has been determined watch more 
television than americans 
the consequences of this become immediately apparent when it is 
realized that the japanese are perhaps the most formidable foreign 
competitor in the american market but can they watch tv and retain 
their productive edge 
japanese television viewers watched an avereage of eight hours of 
tv a day in 1988 according to nielsen media research a division of 
dun amp bradstreet thats one hour more than television viewers in 
the united states 
those attempting to divine the economic future might find 
significance in another nielsen finding about japanese culture the 
most popular programs it says are cartoons followed by quiz and 
audience participation programs 
meanwhile americans are changing their drinking habits perhaps 
for the better there is a trend away from alcoholic drinks to more 
natural products and even to water although commercial soft drink 
figures are rising 
in the past eight years statistics from the beverage industry 
and wright investors service show bottled water has been the 
fastest growing commercial drink in the united states from 27 
gallons per capita in 1980 to 64 gallons in 1988 
meanwhile per capita consumption of distilled spirits powdered 
drinks beer and coffee has declined the gainers are wine juices 
and fruit drinks milk and soft drinks the latter aided by the 
attraction of fewer calories 
by far the biggest percentage increase 114 percent for the 
eight years was in bottled water of various sorts sparkling 
mineral waters flavored seltzers spring water followed by soft 
drinks at 37 percent 
coffee was down 12 percent to 25 gallons per capita in 1988 
beer fell only slightly for the eightyear period by just 
seventenths of a gallon but the decline was especially sharp in 
1988 versus 1987 tea remained flat 
these figures might not electrify you any more than might the 
latest economic report about the gross national product 
conceivably though they could provide an equal amount of insight

seconds and we were staying current on repairs todays going to be 
more of a challenge 
the regional companies already on strike have said that most 
directdial calls were going through normally on automated 
equipment some union jobs were filled by management employees but 
the walkouts disrupted installations and repairs operatorassisted 
calls and inquiries to directory assistance

against new england telephone said insurance is the major issue 
the others you can compromise on he said 
if the big companies the ones that can afford it begin taking 
a stand against paying medical benefits the whole national health 
care issue will go on the back burner calvey said new england 
telephone is part of nynex 
the boston herald reported today that former democratic 
presidential candidate jesse jackson would attend the rally to help 
launch the protest 
the seven baby bells were created by the 1984 breakup of american 
telephone amp telegraph each has sought to get workers to pay a 
larger share of their health insurance costs which have soared at 
twice the rate of inflation in recent years 
in chicago cwa and ameritech officials said they were willing to 
talk but neither side seemed in a hurry

grain and soybean futures closed lower monday on 
the chicago board of trade as traders reacted to forecasts of rain 
in cropproducing areas 
soybean prices were down sharply after rising last week on an 
agriculture department report projecting lowerthanexpected soybean 
production 
all of the speculators who bought friday were seen selling 
aggressively on monday said william biedermann an analyst with 
allendale inc in chicago rain in the forecast was the main 
reason 
forecasts on friday called for dry conditions but mondays 
forecasts called for rain in eastern crop areas early in this week 
and rain in western areas later in the week 
rain in august assures soybean producers a good crop 
biedermann said 
another factor on the soybean market is the south american 
soybean crop he said 
exports from south america are meeting international demand 
before the us harvest without sales from brazil and argentina 
the market would be tight biedermann said 
weekend rains and forecasts for more precipitation also put a 
damper on corn and wheat prices 
however wheat futures rallied towards the close of trading as 
traders factored in taiwans bid for 300000 metric tons of us 
wheat 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 5 cents lower with september at 228 a bushel oats were 
5 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 136 a bushel soybeans 
were 5 cents to 22 cents lower with august at 599 a bushel

k mart corp faced with increased competition 
from such sources as walmart stores inc on monday reported a 109 
percent decline in its secondquarter profits 
the company said lowerthanexpected sales in may and higher 
interest payments led to the drop 
the nations secondlargest retailer behind sears roebuck amp co 
said its secondquarter profit came to 145 million or 72 cents a 
share on revenues of 701 billion during the period ended july 26 
that compared with earnings of 1628 million or 81 cents a share 
on revenues of 668 billion during the same time last year 
for the six months ended july 26 the companys profits were down 
157 percent falling to 2391 million or 119 a share from 
2836 million or 141 a share during the same time last year 
revenues for the period this year were 1307 billion up 44 
percent from sales of 1253 billion last year 
in the first quarter we were disappointed by k marts earnings 
and we attributed it to sears roebuck and the heavy promotion they 
had for their new everyday pricing said analyst sally schaadt of 
fourteen research in new york city 
this whole area of discount retailing has become extremely 
competitive she said its a tough market 
k mart chairman joseph antonini said his companys sales in may 
fell below expectations and the cost of borrowing money was higher 
in the companys second quarter 
he said things should pick up in the second half of the fiscal 
year as the company develops stronger merchandising programs and 
increases the use of a companywide computer link to monitor sales 
k mart operated 4135 outlets at the end of the period including

teachers and school administrators got their 
first look monday at turner broadcasting system incs daily news 
show for use in the classroom a commercialfree alternative to the 
sponsored news program that whittle communications plans to launch 
next spring 
turner is calling its program cnn newsroom and it will be carried 
weekdays at 345 am edt on cable news network 
the predawn telecast is designed to enable teachers to tape the 
program and review it to see if all or part could be used in class 
later that day 
the program was launched well before the new school year begins 
to give teachers and administrators a chance to determine if it fits 
with their lesson plans turner also gets a jump of several months 
on whittles adsupported channel one news program that begins 
nationally in march 
with the notable exception of commercials the first 15minute 
edition of cnn newsroom resembled the 12minute channel one programs 
that whittle communications tested over a sevenweek period in six 
schools last spring 
both programs are anchored by a youthful and demographically 
balanced team the cnn newsroom anchors are cassandra henderson and 
brian todd turner broadcasting employees selected from a group of 
more than 250 applicants 
the programs open with news headlines contain filmed news 
footage make liberal use of maps and carry several feature stories 
chosen and developed to appeal to teenagers 
cnn newsroom had an expanded feature on the career of rep mickey 
leland the texas democrat who was killed in an airplane crash in 
ethiopia 
it also had a feature on a georgia high school teacher who gives 
his students practical experience in using the english language by 
having them research write and edit stories for a folklore magazine 
he publishes 
and it had a feature on chinese students who have found they must 
sit through lessons taught by the army in the aftermath of the 
bloody suppression of a student uprising this summer in beijing 
during its test run earlier this year channel one had features 
on the life of civil rights leader martin luther king jr and series 
that dealt with the environment and life in russia for teenagers 
the services are delivered differently 
cnn newsroom arrives by cable or is taped off television at home 
while channel one is delivered by satellite 
atlantabased turner said it has endorsements or pledges of 
support from cable operators representing nearly 50 percent of the 
cable television hosueholds in the united states to deliver the 
program to schools 
turner is paying the entire bill for producing the show and 
providing a teachers guide by electronic mail to help in using the 
program in class 
whittle based in knoxville tenn is providing both the program 
and delivery by using advertising revenue 
whittle said only a fraction of the nations classrooms are 
individually equipped with tv sets and that without them teachers 
are unable to make the best use possible of the daily news service 
and other television programs 
channel one schools get an average of 50000 in video hardware 
including tv sets videocassette recorders and satellite dishes in 
exchange for allowing whittle to sell two minutes of commercials in 
each 12minute news program to advertisers during the test 
companies pitched candy bars deodorant and jeans to the 
toughtoreach teen audience 
several national education groups have blasted whittle for taking 
unfair advantage of students who are required to be in school and 
may find it difficult to avoid the commercials 
new york education officials have prohibited public schools in 
that state from subscribing to channel one and the top educational 
officer in california has said any school in his state that takes it 
risks losing state aid 
nonetheless whittle hopes to sign up 8000 schools for channel 
one by the start of the 199091 school year turner expects teachers 
in about 1000 schools will use cnn newsroom when school starts in 
the next few weeks

testimony might have

activities in the yen pit the remaining 25 defendants traded in the 
swiss franc pits at the merc and the soybean and us treasury bond 
pits at the chicago board of trade

drexel burnham lambert inc has agreed to pay 
975000 in fines to 10 states in an effort to clear its name and 
operate freely around the country despite a guilty plea to federal 
securities crimes officials said monday 
drexel said it expects to pay 115 million overall to settle 
with the states avoid litigation and retain its ability to do 
business but some states still want to revoke the new york 
investment firms brokerage license according to securities 
regulators 
the settlements follow months of negotiations between drexel and 
a three member panel formed by the north american securities 
administrators association that yielded an unprecedented pact 
governing state operations of a wall street firm 
drexel earlier this year agreed to plead guilty to six felonies 
and pay 650 million to resolve fraud allegations stemming from the 
governments lengthy wall street insider trading investigation 
it also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and 
unprecedented federal supervision in the april settlement of civil 
charges by the securities and exchange commission 
most states can revoke a firms right to do business if it is 
convicted of or admits to committing a felony drexel also must 
settle with puerto rico and the district of columbia 
our objective is to retain our regulatory license in the 52 
jurisdictions in which we do business drexel spokesman steven 
anreder said were there already and weve already qualified and 
we think its proper as a good corporate citizen to do that 
the 10 states with which drexel has reached agreements are 
arkansas hawaii idaho kansas maryland mississippi oklahoma 
south carolina vermont and wyoming 
oklahoma state securities administrator susan bryant who headed 
the drexel settlement panel said 20 other states have indicated 
they expect to reach a pact under the basic agreement with some 
additional provisions 
two or three holdout states want to revoke drexels license 
while settlements with the remaining jurisdictions still are 
unresolved bryant said she wouldnt name the holdouts 
i think this approach has enabled smaller states to enter into 
agreements with drexel where they wouldnt have been able to if they 
had been on their own she said 
under the settlements drexel is contributing money to establish 
a national foundation to promote investor education and securities 
law compliance thats an acceptable alternative to some state 
securities regulators that lack fining authority or dont want to 
lose the money to a general budget fund 
i didnt want to structure this as a fine said ellyn brown 
state securities commissioner in maryland which drexel has agreed 
to pay 200000 it concerns me a little bit that the next people 
in the door could say you sold drexel their license how much for 
us that appears to me as potentially problematic 
in arkansas drexel is paying 100000 even though the state has 
no evidence drexel did anything wrong there in oklahoma drexel 
will pay 25000 to reimburse fees for the securities divisions 
work but no fine in kansas the 125000 fine is designated for the 
states general fund 
south carolina is using its 150000 to endow a chair in business 
and ethics at the university of south carolinas law school 
settling with the states relieves drexel of possible litigation 
by individual states and frees state regulators from having to 
investigate the firms trading activities from 1984 to 1986 when 
the alleged sec fraud occurred 
the general pact requires drexels outside consultant to examine 
possible state securities law violations and sets conditions on 
drexels reentry into the retail brokerage business which drexel 
quit in april 
it also requires drexel to spread the word through newspaper 
advertisements to investors who may be entitled to restitution under 
the sec settlement drexel has agreed to set aside 350 million for 
investors and pay 300 million in fines to the government 
drexel faces class action lawsuits nationwide some of which have 
been consolidated in federal court in new york by investors who 
claim they were defrauded those who may be entitled to restitution 
include people who bought stocks in 20 allegedly fraudulent 
transactions cited by the sec

when the dollar came down it came down a long way so were 
seeing a reversal going on here money is flowing back into the 
united states irving trusts ryan explained 
lower interest rates are seen as bearish for the dollar because 
it makes dollardenominated securities such as bonds less 
attractive to foreign investors as foreign interest declines so 
does the need to convert foreign currencies into dollars 
overseas the dollar turned mixed monday with many traders 
taking to the sidelines before tuesdays assumption day religious 
holiday which will close many european markets

sell 
a late selloff in the bond market helped weaken stocks in the 
final hour of trading

after recent gains and that the market continued to show an 
underlying strength much of the weakness they said stemmed from a

the strike in peru had been planned for several weeks but it was 
expected that efforts by the government would prevent the walkout 
talks broke down over the weekend resulting in the walkout 
at least twothirds if not more of the miners are out said 
john steel an analyst with refco co in new york adding that the 
walkout could have an adverse effect on supplies 
the strike comes as copper production is already suffering due to 
civilian strife in papua new guinea also a strike at canadas 
highland valley copper mine in british columbia continues 
copper production in chile could also be disrupted because 
drought has cut power supplies steel said 
grain and soybean futures closed lower on the chicago board of 
trade as traders reacted to forecasts of rain in cropproducing 
areas 
soybean prices were down sharply after rising last week on an 
agriculture department report projecting lowerthanexpected soybean 
production 
all of the speculators who bought friday were seen selling 
aggressively on monday said william biedermann an analyst with 
allendale inc in chicago rain in the forecast was the main 
reason 
forecasts on friday called for dry conditions but mondays 
forecasts called for rain in eastern crop areas early this week and 
rain in western areas later in the week 
rain in august assures soybean producers a good crop 
biedermann said 
another factor on the soybean market is the south american 
soybean crop he said 
exports from south america are meeting international demand 
before the us harvest without sales from brazil and argentina 
the market would be tight biedermann said

ounce silver was 2 cent to 8 cent higher with august at 5195 a 
troy ounce

the government will try to 
reschedule its debt to the international monetary fund in talks 
later this month economy minister nestor rapanelli said monday 
argentina virtually stopped interest payments in april 1988 on 
the approximately 63 billion it owes to commercial banks and 
governmental institutions like the imf principal payments were 
deferred in 1987 
total overdue payments amount to about 44 billion foreign 
minister domingo cavallo said last week 
the central bank discloses few details about argentinas debt 
and the total owed to the imf is not clear the newspaper la nacion 
citing sources in the economy ministry reported last month the 
country is 620 million behind in payments owed to the imf 
rapanelli met monday with us assistant treasury secretary david 
mulford and discussed the program of budget austerity and 
privatizations proposed by president carlos menem to stabilize the 
economy and promote growth the government news agency telam 
reported

of the us state department and the president that they are 
supporting this stage of economic recovery rapanelli said 
mulford later was set to meet wtih menem 
inflation in july was almost 200 percent and unemployment has 
soared in the recession that was touched off by a run on the central 
banks foreign exchange reserves and a massive devaluation of the 
austral 
menem who was elected in may and inaugurated in july would like 
to reschedule argentinas commercial and private debt and arrange 
new loans including 15 billion from the imf and a 350 million

a 3weekold strike at american assembly 
plants along the border is threatening the growth of the industry 
nationwide plant officials said monday theyre asking the 
president of mexico to end it 
the 15 strikeclosed plants in the border city of reynosa want 
the citys other 27 assembly operations to cease production in 
sympathy said don king manager of reynosas west bend plant one 
of the affected companies 
some of the plants in reynosa have been closed for three weeks 
and to date we have not received any indication of support from the 
tamaulipas state government except promises the companies said 
in a letter addressed to president carlos salinas de gortari 
salinas was out of town monday and did not respond immediately to 
the request 
we are with you in your modernization program and your fight 
against corruption but we need your action as soon as possible 
the letter said 
the foreignoperated assembly plants most of them 
americanowned have been closed since july 25 over a power struggle 
between two union leaders 
union leader rafael morales put up red and black strike flags on 
the gates of plants whose laborers had organized under leader abel 
hernandez 
morales argued that hernandez had failed among other things to 
get union control over the transportation of raw and finished 
materials and the disposal of scrap 
morales also argues that hernandez can no longer represent the 
workers because hernandez withdrew recently from the federation of 
mexican laborers or ctm said king 
king said however under mexican labor law we dont have to 
have a union affiliated with the ctm 
he said the companies contend that strike is illegal because only 
workers not a rival union have the right to strike against a 
company 
king said labor law prohibits workers from crossing a strike 
banner and american companies would not urge their employees to do 
so 
it concerns the safety of our workers he said 
king said the strikeclosed plants are asking the rest of 
reynosas 42 maquiladoras to lock out workers as a demonstration 
of their support and a confirmation that they dont condone illegal 
activies by the union 
closing would put pressure on the mexican government to solve the 
problem since the plants provide foreign capital and jobs and the 
government does not want investors to get nervous 
although the state labor arbitration board already has ruled in 
favor of morales some of the companies say they will close down 
permanently unless higher authorities recognize hernandez king said 
tamaulipas state has had a history of labor instability he 
said 
the plants known as maquiladoras take advantage of cheap 
mexican labor to assemble products in mexico for export 
the government has made efforts in the 1980s to woo plants to 
this country because of jobs they provide and the badly needed 
foreign capital they bring in 
the industry has grown from 800 plants and 218000 employees in 
1985 to about 1400 plants and 392000 workers today 
the strike the industrys most severe in memory could affect 
the growth of the maquiladora industry in general depending on how 
this is resolved said king 
if the government is not going to support a foreign investor 
hes going to be more cautious about making an investment in this 
country he said 
but james gaffney vice president of the reynosa association of 
maquiladoras said monday that the plants have no response at this 
time to the request 
asked if his calzado de mexico plant which makes converse tennis 
shoes would support the strike gaffney said i havent talked to 
our corporate people yet 
about 27000 people work in the citys assembly plants the 
strike so far has locked about 2000 people out of their jobs 
the dispute has been in a federal court since last week but no 
decision has been made king said 
officials of invacare corp of elyria ohio said their invamex 
operations in reynosa were not operating monday but that they 
expected the labor problems to be ironed out soon 
the company which makes wheelchairs invested about 5 million 
to start up the plant last year and was planning to expand next year

a us administrative law judge has 
recommended upholding a nokia corp patent design of cellular mobile 
telephones but ruled against the company in two other patent 
disputes brought by motorola inc officials said monday 
judge john j mathias in washington recommended to the 
international trade commission against nokia on its patent for the 
phones keypad and temperature control device said officials for 
both companies 
the finnish telecommunications companys north american unit 
nokia inc is based in basking ridge nj the company said it 
expects the trade commission to throw out the administrative law 
judges recommendation on the two component patents 
motorola based in schaumburg ill filed patent infringement 
complaints with the itc and in federal court in chicago in april to 
try to block the import of certain cellular telephones 
nokia and tandy corp jointly make cellular telephones in south 
korea to be are sold under separate brand names tandy markets the 
phones under its radio shack brand name and nokia under the name 
nokiamobira 
motorola is seeking to temporarily bar nokia and tandy from 
importing the cellular phones and in the federal court proceeding 
is asking for unspecified monetary damages 
the ruling was clearly very favorable to motorola said 
motorola spokesman tim kellogg 
the itc is to make an initial finding by aug 29 when the 
commission would decide how large a bond the two companies must post 
so they can continue selling the imported phones until a final 
decision

eastman kodak co chairman colby chandler testified 
monday he knew getting into instant photography could mean a lawsuit 
from competitor polaroid corp but sid he was convinced his company 
would win 
chandler was called to testify in a us district court trial to 
determine how many dollars in damages his company will have to pay 
polaroid an earlier federal court decision established that kodak 
infringed on patents of polaroid the cambridge massbased pioneer 
of instant photography 
polaroid is seeking 12 billion which would be a record award in 
a patent infringement suit while kodak has argued it should pay 
177 million an amount equal to a royalty of 5 percent on the 
cameras and film it sold from 1976 to 1985 
chandler answered yes when asked if he had felt there was a 
chance kodaks introduction of an instant camera in the mid1970s 
could provoke a suit from polaroid 
but he said i felt we had reduced the risk to such a low level 
it was not a major consideration 
chandler who is chief executive as well as chairman of 
rochester nybased kodak testified before judge a david mazzone 
that kodaks corporate policies clearly state we will not 
knowingly violate or infringe on another companys patents 
asked if he had any reason to believe that policy was violated 
when kodak entered the instant film business chandler said no i 
did not 
chandler said he relied on advice from the companys patent 
attorneys in deciding that kodaks product would not infringe on 
polaroids patents 
in may polaroid chairman william j mccune jr testfied that 
polaroid and eastman kodak had a productive working relationship for 
decades with kodak making film for polaroid but that things soured 
in the late 1960s when polaroid introduced its sx70 camera 
kodak mccune said was asked to produce the new complex 
negative that polaroid had developed for that instant color camera 
but he said kodak demanded a license from polaroid which would have 
allowed kodak to develop its own instant photography 
polaroid ultimately built its own film manufacturing facilities 
in massachusetts 
mccune testified then that instant photography is polaroids 
bread and butter and that kodaks introduction of instant film 
and cameras cut deeply into his companys profits

upjohn co said monday it is launching an 
aggressive new ad campaign for its hair loss treatment now that the 
federal government has banned all other wouldbe competitors 
on wednesday the kalamazoobased pharmaceutical company will 
unveil full and halfpage print advertisements in 29 newspapers 
that will represent one of the few times the name of a prescription 
drug has appeared in consumerdirected ads 
the new ad features a clip of a new york times story about the 
us food and drug administrations ruling against nonprescription 
products that claim to promote hair growth or prevent hair loss 
the headline for the ad reads the good news is theres one 
product thats proven to grow hair rogaine 
the ads also will appear in many national magazines beginning 
next week 
on july 7 the fda said that none of the manufacturers of the 
dozens of nonprescription creams and lotions on the market has 
shown that any of those products work 
when the ban goes into effect in january manufacturers of any 
nonprescription drugs claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair 
will have to provide proof that it is safe and effective before it 
can be put on the market 
the agency will remove the products from the market on a 
casebycase basis if their distributors continue to make such 
claims without proof 
upjohn estimates american men spend more than 200 million each 
year on such unproven hairloss products 
rogaine a 2 percent minoxidil solution is the only fdaapproved 
hair loss treatment it has been on the market since last september 
what this does is enable us to more directly refer to rogaine 
and at the same time use the fda ruling to differentiate rogaine 
from all the other wouldbe treatments upjohn spokesman tr reid 
said 
financial analysts who have been disappointed with rogaine 
sales have blamed part of the products lackluster performance on 
ambiguous advertising in the past upjohn hasnt used the name of 
the product in its ads because the fda requires full disclosure of 
possible side effects 
the ads have used only the company name and advised balding men 
to see their doctors if they are concerned about hair loss 
the latest ads list the products possible side effects such as 
itching of the scalp as well as its effectiveness the topical 
solution has been shown in testing to grow hair in about 39 percent 
of young men who are in the early stages of balding 
us food and drug administration rules prohibit companies from 
advertising brand names of prescription drugs unless the ads also 
list possible side effects and any warnings about use of the drug 
the ads which feature a tollfree number for more information 
also offers a 10 certificate as an incentive to visit your 
doctor 
the drug costs about 60 for a onemonth supply 
the ads also say that 2 million men have tried rogaine upjohn 
which doesnt release sales of individual products said the 
products performance continues to climb

denverbased us west and st louis based southwestern bell which 
both reached settlements sunday 
officials at the four struck companies said customers were 
experiencing some delays in directory assistance operatorassisted 
calls and repair services but management employees were being 
trained to take up part of the slack 
four thousand people cant do the job of 12800 but theyre 
doing the best they can said eileen dixon a spokeswoman for 
michigan bell an ameritech subsidiary 
libraries have reported a high demand from people wanting 
telephone numbers but unable to reach a directory assistance

awaiting a union response he said 
weve been making progress obviously pitt said wed like 
our people back and every day we hope its the last day of the 
strike 
but cwa spokesman jim willer said the companys healthinsurance 
proposal was unacceptable according to willer the company 
continued to demand that workers pay deductibles in addition to half 
the premiums for relatives other than spouses and children the 
union refuses to pay any deductibles or premiums 
willer said the company agreed to give an advisory committee on 
health benefits more power but said this obvious superficial 
attempt to settle the contract is yet another in a long list of 
insults 
the issue of who pays for health insurance has been a key issue 
in several of the negotiations as management has tried to shift 
some of the costs onto the workers 
a spokesman for pacific bell a subsidiary of pacific telesis 
said talks were planned later in the day but no talks were 
scheduled at nynex or at the strikebound subsidiaries of ameritech

was driving on the service road of a nynex facility when her car 
brushed horgan after he and several other pickets gathered around 
her car and yelled at her 
horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded on 
the windshield but slid off and hit his head on the pavement 
according to the police account the union disputed that saying he 
fell onto the hood when the young woman accelerated no charges were 
filed 
new york telephone co president fred salerno appealed for calm 
after the accident and said he had asked the union to resume 
negotiations to try and calm the waters 
in elmont ny police said a nynex car was burned shortly 
after midnight in a company parking lot the fire which police 
described as suspicious also caused minor damage to a building 
nearby 
most of west virginia was without long distance service for 
about eight hours beginning late sunday when an aerial cable was 
damaged chesapeake amp potomac telephone spokeswoman roberta fowlkes 
said vandalism couldnt be ruled out as the cause of the outage 
which affected 600000 customers lines also were damaged in the 
sissonville area affecting local service 
scattered incidents of strikerelated vandalism were reported 
last week including several incidents of damaged lines in new 
jersey peter ventimiglia a spokesman for new jersey bell said 
monday that the company had counted more than 175 incidents of 
vandalism or sabotage last week but no new incidents had been 
reported sunday night or monday morning

the us dollar traded higher against the japanese 
yen tuesday morning while share prices on the tokyo stock exchange 
rose marginally as many participants took summer holidays 
the dollar opened at 14240 yen up 047 yen from mondays close 
of 14193 yen the ending rate in new york also 
its higher start followed a similar uptrend on overseas markets 
traders said 
minori takeuchi a trader with chemical bank in tokyo said early 
dealing was initiated by japanese commercial banks which were 
mainly buying the dollar 
there was little dollarselling incentive now in the market so 
the dollar was getting stronger against other currencies too she 
said 
the dollars upswing began when the us jobless rate was 
released two weeks ago and the nations unemployment rate fell by 
01 percent in july 
market players were further reassured about the steady growth in 
the us economy by a 04 percent decline in the producer price 
index and a 09 percent rise in the retail price index for july 
both released friday in washington 
the dollar was moving little after the opening and partcipants 
are not energetic enough to push the currency over the 143yen 
mark ms takeuchi said adding that trading was thin because many 
investors are on summer vacations this week 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues grew by 303 
points or 001 percent to reach 3467465 within the first 15 
minutes of morning trading 
dealers said trading was inactive also due to summer holidays

the environmental protection agency on monday 
said it plans to lower sulfur concentrations in diesel fuel to curb 
motor vehicle exhaust pollution and improve air quality in urban 
areas 
under the epa proposal which still must be adopted as a formal 
agency regulation refiners would be required to reduce the maximum 
permitted sulfur content of diesel fuel by 80 percent before october 
1993 
diesel engines are one of the major sources of particulate 
pollution or smoke and soot from motor vehicles in urban areas 
especially in major cities in the west sulfur compounds contribute 
to the problem forming fine acidic mists that can worsen breathing 
problems and contribute to acid rain 
heavyduty diesel engines are a major source of particulate 
emissions including the smaller fine particles that are of 
greatest concern in protecting public health said epa 
administrator william k reilly in a statement announcing the 
proposal 
the epa proposal would call for the same reduction in sulfur 
content in diesel fuel by 1993 from 025 percent by weight to 005 
percent as recently called for by state officials in california 
the california requirement also calls for changes in the fuel to 
reduce the level of certain pollutionpromoting chemicals called 
aromatic compounds epas proposal would cap concentrations at the 
current level instead of reducing them 
bob yuhnke an attorney for the environmental defense fund in 
denver said the epa is taking the right step in calling for 
reductions in sulfur but he criticized the agency for not also 
proposing reductions in the aromatic chemicals 
going only half way leaves the states holding the bag yuhnke 
said without additional curbs on diesel fuel emissions some states 
may have trouble meeting urban air quality requirements expected in 
clean air legislation now being debated in congress he said
