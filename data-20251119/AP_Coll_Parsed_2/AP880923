a strike by 1200 bay area rapid transit 
district mechanics janitors and clerks begins early monday union 
officials said thursday threatening to cripple service for 204000 
daily riders 
the leadership has selected monday 1201 am to commence 
a strike against the bart district the pickets will go up at that 
time said suzanne angeli vice president of local 790 of the 
united public employees union 
about 500 train operators and station agents represented by the 
amalgamated transit unions local 1555 will honor the picket lines 
said atu local leader hank white 
between them the two unions represent nearly twothirds of the 
employees in the bart system which carries about 204000 riders 
dayily in three san francisco bay area counties 
immediately after local 790s announcement bart district 
officials began reexamining the unions demands and considering 
how to keep the system operating bart spokesman sy mouber said 
we will of course begin making plans as to what level of 
service we can operate mouber said a problem were going to 
have is certifying people who are going to be operating the 
trains 
the district also planned to meet with a mediator friday 
morning mouber said but no new talks were scheduled 
bart said earlier that if both unions went on strike its 
managers may be able to provide limited train service as they did 
during a 1979 strike 
members of local 790 rejected the public agencys contract offer 
wednesday night by a vote of 464354 
the threeyear pact calls for a 14 percent increase in pay and 
benefits the first year and 3 percent for each of the next two 
years with a onetime costofliving payment at the end 
noneconomic issues including proposed changes in work rules 
working conditions safety issues and union rights are at the 
center of the dispute angeli said both unions have criticized the 
proposed retirement benefits 
local 1555 approved the contract by six votes 170164 and 
barts board of directors ratified that agreement on thursday but 
local 1555 after meeting with local 790 late thursday reaffirmed 
its promise to honor picket lines 
bart general manager keith bernard said it was absolute lunacy 
and very irresponsible to seek a strike calling the proposed 
contract one of the best in the industry today and noting that 
bart faces a 48 million deficit in the current fiscal year

the moody blues the british band that 
brought an elegance of sound to rock n roll in the 1960s is 
struggling with political infighting over its direction and style 
but swissborn keyboardist patrick moraz who joined the band in 
1978 with the departure of singer mike pinder says hes confident 
its five members can soar above the turmoil to write some 
incredible material as a group 
there is a lot of political decisions and policies being made 
behind the scenes about who composes what moraz said in a 
telephone interview from los angeles prior to a recent concert at 
parkwest resort near salt lake city but that really shouldnt 
hinder the fact that we are a group and we are a very good group 
probably one of the best in the world 
the group launched a nationwide tour this summer in cincinnati 
to mark the 20th anniversary of the british rockers first us 
tour 
the outspoken moraz said he was not happy with the groups 
newest album sur la mer on the sea released in the 
united states in june it was weak he said and had undergone a 
corporate approach 
he was particularly upset that flutistsinger ray thomas an 
original member of the moody blues was not called by the producer 
to participate 
i think its inexcusable personally hes a very important 
force in the moody blues like all of us moraz said the album 
is selling moderately well and one of its songs i know youre 
out there somewhere was at the top of the pop charts this summer 
it was 1967 when the moody blues delighted millions with the 
release of its single nights in white satin a haunting 
choirlike love song written by lead singer justin hayward that 
was followed by the highly acclaimed and successful album days 
of future passed the group had earlier hit the charts with go 
now the no 1 single in britain in 1964 
in their 22 years the moody blues the other members are 
singerguitarist john lodge and drummer graeme edge have sold 
more than 50 million albums and traveled the world time and again 
giving concerts and writing songs 
the group broke up in the early 1970s but reunited six years 
later in the interim hayward and lodge produced an album blue 
jays thomas pinder and lodge each produced albums of their own 
however in 1978 the five decided to revive the moody blues 
sound in the course of making octave their 10th album pinder 
left and moraz with his classical music background and a string 
of selfproduced albums behind him was recruited 
do the conflicts within the moody blues auger badly for the 
future 
conflict always weakens if the conflict can come to a 
selftransformation which calls for growth of creativity and then 
fanning that fire so the group would benefit its good said 
moraz a former keyboardist for yes if a conflict generates into 
a bitter situation then obviously it weakens the whole system 
and that probably is what happened on this last album 
its a very simpletype political matter theres a 
segment of egos out there and that weakens the whole thing and a 
group like the moody blues should show the example because they put 
it in their songs so why cant we apply it to our lives and our 
artistic life as a group 
despite the disagreements the moody blues have no intention of 
breaking up again 
i mean things happen all the time with rock n roll groups 
and everything but after 22 years of almost living happily ever 
after theres no reason why we should do that he said 
no no no we all are conscious of our own mistakes and 
everybody makes mistakes im absolutely positive the group will 
stay together 
said lead singer justin hayward in an earlier interview with the 
associated press we might go on forever there is no such thing 
as retirement as far as we are concerned after all what would we 
do then

the rising land costs and traffic 
jams of modern amsterdam are changing the face of the canal 
belt the citys cultural and economic core since the middle of 
the 14th century 
the industry that has operated there for centuries has moved to 
the suburbs leaving behind a 35percent employment rate in the 
area and bringing yuppylike gentrification and skyrocketing rents 
to neighborhoods that hadnt changed much since the 17th century 
the latest and the last of the industries to depart was klenes 
candy factory which had permeated its neighborhood with the 
distinct aroma of licorice since it opened in 1915 
klenes factory moved to a modern 95million plant in hoorn 
20 miles north 
we left for a number of reasons but the catastrophic traffic 
situation here was the most important one said hans hilarius 
klenes managing director 
the company serves about 10 percent of the dutch licorice market 
with yearly sales amounting to the guilder equivalent of 4 million 
as klenes output more than tripled over the past decade 
getting the ingredients mainly sugar and starch in and the 
licorice and peppermint out became an almost impossible task 
because of the canal belts old narrow streets hilarius said in a 
recent interview 
the daily average was five 20ton trucks with raw materials 
and the finished product a day said hilarius the trucks had to 
run an obstacle course of traffic jams on the 8foot wide street 
along the looiersgracht canal 
industrial activity within amsterdams city center had been 
declining since the mid1960s when the city developed huge 
industrial zones in the deepwater port area west of the city 
but development of the industrial zone was stunted by the 1973 
oil crisis recession 
instead of industrial giants coming in it was small to 
mediumsized businesses that took refuge from heavy traffic and 
high land leases in the cityowned industrial zones city leases 
which serve as a sort of real estate tax have increased from the 
equivalent of 120 a square foot in 1978 to 4 now 
an amsterdam chamber of commerce survey indicated that during 
the last eight months of 1986 more than 800 such firms moved ut of 
the 23squaremile canl belt taking with them them some 2200 
jobs 
among the major departures was the heineken brewery which 
shifted its main brewery to zoeterwoude 25 miles south of the 
capital and kept only its head office and a demonstration plant 
for tourist tours in the capital 
it worries us greatly that 35 percent of the city centers 
work force is now unemployed said chamber of commerce chairman 
rob de vilder and most of the companies that left employed 
lowgrade labor 
amsterdams average unemployment rate is 184 percent well 
above the national figure of 14 percent klenes 85member work 
force was made up of unskilled laborers 
hilarius said he unsuccessfully tried to buy city land for a new 
plant in the cramped city center city hall spokesman harald ytsma 
said however no municipal land had been sold since 1896 when the 
city adopted a leaseonly policy to have tighter control over land 
use 
part of the areas unemployment problem stems from the 
traditional reluctance of dutch workers to commute to jobs outside 
their own cities with the majority of the commuting class white 
collar employees 
de vilder of the chamber of commerce minimizes the problem of 
industry abandoning the city center saying other smaller business 
are taking its place 
the city is losing lots of unskilled jobs but on the other 
hand thousands of small businesses are opening their doors every 
year he said 
what is industrial activity in our view a small computer 
repair company also is industrial activity and such firms abound 
in the inner city 
that shift has prompted a gentrification that is turning 
historic workingclass neighborhoods like the canalwoven jordaan 
into upscale neighborhoods 
with most city jobs now in the banking commerce media and 
tourism sectors de vilder says unskilled workers should be 
induced to commute to outoftown jobs 
but blue collar attachment to inner city neighborhoods is often 
stronger than the draw of jobs in a strange city 
one elderly jordaan woman signalled that bittersweet attachment 
when she told a new whitecollar neighbor if it werent for 
people like you my son could afford to live in this neighborhood

marshall fields is the homegrown favorite in 
this citys retail game now an invader from new york will sell its 
wares on michigan avenue raising a question for people with power 
in their pocketbooks 
gosh dahling whats a shopper to do 
bloomingdales big apple boss gotham giant 59th street 
strongman is opening saturday a sixfloor home a few blocks from 
lake michigan and there is gleeful speculation around town about 
which retailer will have the registers ringing 
for a while there will be blood in the streets says bill 
zwecker a society columnist who monitors the pulse of chicagos 
upper crust for the skyline weekly newspaper 
most people recognize this is a bloomingdalesfields 
battle he said its been building up to a crescendo there 
has been an electricity to this arrival that i have never seen 
and when it comes to keeping customers happy a little partying 
cant hurt 
fields threw a benefit for the lyric opera of chicago on sept 
9 that was attended by 1200 people the gathering also celebrated 
the 10 million renovation at fields water tower store just a 
brisk stroll from the new kid on the block 
partygoers clinked glasses with designers bill blass louis 
dellolio and carolina herrera as fields brought out the heavy 
artillery to woo the local elite 
bloomingdales opening fete is friday and 2500 people have 
been invited to its benefit for the chicago symphony orchestra 
invited guests will hear soothing strings big band sounds and 
contemporary rock on all six floors of the store they will eat 
petrossian smoked salmon and sip fine wines and french champagne 
the lineup of french couturiers attending will be headed by karl 
lagerfeld 
there will be plenty of people who will try to crash 
zwecker said the peoplewatching will be unequaled 
thats fine with bloomies as the retailer is 
affectionately known in new york and eight other states chairman 
marvin traub wants to make a big splash in the windy city 
the stores design was influenced by another local favorite 
frank lloyd wright the oak park architect whose prairie style 
peppers chicago and the suburbs five floors match various wright 
designs including the robie house the arizona biltmore and 
tokyos imperial hotel 
when doors open to shoppers saturday the store will feature 
guest appearances by some of the top names in fashion isaac 
mizrahi patricia pastor and paloma picasso 
general manager brian mcmahon says bloomingdales will be 
staffed by people who will earn only commissions on sales no 
salary a first for the 17store chain and a policy believed to 
improve customer service 
you name the store in the city of chicago weve ben able to 
get the best people and bring them in he said of recruiting a 
sales team its only going to be a coup if we exercise the 
service well 
this market has created more interest in a store opening than 
any ive ever been connected with and ive lived in washington 
new york and boston mcmahon said 
its certainly uplifting but ive tried to tell everybody to 
retain a high level of humility theres nothing worse than 
building up a crescendo believing your own press and then having a 
shopper come in and say this isnt what i expected 
at marshall fields reaction to bloomingdales opening is 
lowkey 
our game plan is to compete effectively against all 
competitors and bloomingdales is one them said gary witkin 
executive vice president 
i think our attitude about business is no different today than 
it was a year ago

its been three years since ryan whites highly publicized 
battle to go to school in indiana and three years since another 
child with aids quietly entered schools in massachusetts 
for children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus the 
same uncertainty remains some started classes with little or no 
fuss this year while a boy in illinois who has already fled one 
town faced more protests in his new home 
aids kills said one sign carried by protesters in illinois 
help keep aids out of our schools said another 
we dont want to be in the spotlight i dont want to be a 
civil rights activist says tammie robertson whose 8yearold 
son jason hopes to enter school in south roxana ill 
in lakewood colo and st albans wva 5yearolds with aids 
entered kindergarten classes with no fuss 
however there were some protests in another colorado school 
when parents learned that an 8yearold who had tested positive for 
the aids antibody an indicator of exposure was attending classes 
kay pride spokeswoman for jefferson county schools said state 
law requires school officials to keep the childs identity 
confidential however she said it is school policy to notify 
parents whose children attend the same school as a child who has 
been exposed to the aids virus 
the centers for disease control issued guidelines three years 
ago saying there was apparently no risk within a classroom of 
contracting aids which is transmitted by sexual contact sharing 
infected hypodermic needles or receiving a transfusion of 
contaminated blood 
of the more than 72000 aids cases confirmed since june 1981 
the cdc says not one was transmitted within a school 
president reagans commission on aids headed by adm james d 
watkins affirmed earlier this year that there is no need to 
treat those infected with hiv in a manner different from those not 
infected in such settings as the workplace housing and the 
schools 
weve won all the cases the case law is pretty clear that 
there is no reason to exclude hiv children says william 
rubenstein staff counsel for the aids and civil liberties project 
of the american civil liberties union 
winning the case however isnt always enough ryan white won 
his legal fight to attend school in russiaville ind but gave up 
in the face of protests jason robertson won a court order last 
school year to join classes in granite city ill but his family 
also decided to move 
john mccarthy superintendent of schools in swansea mass 
presided over the peaceful admission of an aids victim in 1985 
the fear the parents have is that the child who is attending 
school with aids could pass the disease on to their children 
mccarthy said thats impossible so what you do is talk about 
how infection with aids occurs and that the people who should 
answer questions like that are medical people 
beyond that i dont know what you can say incidental contact 
is not the way this disease is spread mccarthy said you 
either believe it or you dont 
in west virginia this year kanawha county school officials 
carefully laid the ground 5000 aids information pamphlets were 
distributed around st albans county health officials conducted 
aids workshops for school employees and a county health department 
nurse held workshops at each school 
kanawha county school superintendent richard d trubla thanked 
local media for providing information about aids which was 
accurate and to the point but not sensational 
charles conner superintendent of schools in south roxana said 
the objections to jasons attendance come mainly from a minority 
group of parents in need of further education 
in the most prominent case this year a federal judge in florida 
ordered that a mentally retarded 6yearold girl be admitted to a 
special education program but only if she was confined in a 
plexiglas box 
the judge said the child who has an advanced case of aids 
acquired through a blood transfusion in puerto rico should be 
isolated until she became toilettrained and learned to stop 
sucking her thumb and forefingers the girl is being educated at 
home while her case is appealed 
rubenstein said the aclus involvement with the schoolaids 
issue has shifted from the courts to lobbying school boards as they 
draft regulations for handling the admission of infected students 
the national association of boards of education is close to 
completing work on model guidelines which would permit hivinfected 
students to be admitted the same as any other student said 
katherine fraser codirector of the associations aids education 
project 
an important component of those guidelines is guaranteeing 
confidentiality for the student 
there is no particular reaons why people in a school setting 
need to know that there is an hivinfected person in the school 
she said in most cases there is no need for parents to know

dozens of prominent leftists are 
returning from exile to join the campaign against military 
president augusto pinochet but some are bringing embarrassment as 
well as enthusiasm to the opposition 
police said wednesday that 53 of the 504 leftists affected by 
pinochets sept 1 decision to end all official exile have returned 
home 
the list includes prominent members of the leftist government of 
president salvador allende ousted by pinochet in a bloody 1973 
coup and leaders of marxist parties that supported it 
most of the returning exiles have declared support for an 
opposition campaign to defeat pinochet in an oct 5 presidential 
referendum but some are also making radical statements that 
conflict with the oppositions campaign strategy 
in the referendum 74 million registered voters will vote on a 
proposal by the countrys military commanders that pinochet remain 
in power until 1997 
if a majority vote yes pinochet will start a new eightyear 
term next march 11 if the no vote prevails an open election will 
be called next year and pinochet will hand over power to the winner 
in 1990 
a 16party coalition is busily campaigning for pinochets defeat 
images of joyful dissidents returning to their homeland after 
more than a decade in exile have provided an emotional charge to 
campaign 
a huge airport crowd is expected saturday for the scheduled 
arrival of allendes widow hortensia bussi 
allende died in the takeover and his wife fled the country days 
later emerging as a major critic of pinochet her visit is 
expected to give the opposition a major boost 
but some of the exiles appear too outspoken for the moderate 
oppositions tastes 
volodia teitelboim a former senator and a leader of the 
proscribed communist party returned on tuesday from exile in 
moscow and promptly criticized the opposition strategy 
he said it lacks real unity because the communists are 
excluded from the coalition whose members range from the 
centerright to socialist left 
he also criticized six parties from the right to the centerleft 
for joining in a coalition to form a moderate transition government 
in case pinochet loses 
the new coalition announced wednesday and led by the moderate 
christian democratic party the nations largest said its goal is 
to offer chileans an alternative of government for the first 
democatic period after pinochet 
the opposition leaders have carefully avoided comment on the 
remarks by teitelboim and others 
patricio aylwin president of the christian democrats asked 
about teitelboims criticism replied only the communist party 
is not a member of our coalition 
genaro arriagada secretarygeneral of the coalition recently 
defended the leftists inalienable right to return to their 
homeland when they chose even if it might not be the best moment 
for their arrival 
we have no moral right to ask that they postpone their 
return he said at a news conference 
progovernment media are enthusiastically selecting and 
broadcasting some statements by the returning exiles to emphasize 
its claim that the opposition is dominated by the extreme left 
when mario palestro a radical socialist excongressman 
returned to chile last week he paid homage to my comrades of 
the leftist revolutionary movement a guerrilla band he warned 
that when the people recover power many rightwingers will 
have to flee the country like rabbits 
since then government political ads on television have 
repeatedly shown palestro making his fierce speech upon arrival at 
the airport 
maria eugenia oyarzun a progovernment political commentator 
said in the newspaper la tercera last sunday that the returning 
exiles are ruining the oppositions efforts to cultivate an image 
of moderation 
defense minister adm patricio carvajal said on wednesday i 
think its very good that these people are returning so chileans 
can see the the continued disorder and split within the 
opposition

akihito the quiet dapper prince who is assuming 
his ailing fathers duties has gently parted the inscrutable veil 
that once shrouded japans monarchy 
the eldest son of the reclusive emperor hirohito is a 
globetrotting diplomat without portfolio a weekend tennis player 
whose youthful drivers license identified him simply as akihito 
shinno prince akihito 
people still stand in awe of the emperor but there is a real 
sense of intimacy with the crown prince and princess said yasuo 
shigeta akihitos longtime chamberlain 
the 54yearold prince is the first monarch schooled among 
commoners and will be the first to ascend the chrysanthemum throne 
as a human and not a living god 
on his own akihito has set a number of other imperial 
precedents first to court and marry a commoner first to raise his 
own children first to throw out the first ball at a baseball game 
first to actively shoulder the extensive globetrotting duties of 
an increasingly outwardlooking japan 
i want to be a man with a strong moral backbone with keen 
reliable insight and knowledge a friend quoted him as saying 
i want to shake up the imperial protocol system 
he did just that with his marriage in 1959 to michiko shoda the 
beautiful cultured daughter of a wealthy miller the prince 
courted her by phone in long conversations that piqued the 
curiosity of a public once excluded from imperial life their 
wedding cavalcade drew half a million wellwishers onto the streets 
of tokyo 
akihito and michiko have three children prince hiro 28 
prince aya 22 and princess nori 19 
the princes style is different from that of his father a 
frail stooped man who made his obligatory public appearances but 
never seemed comfortable at them hirohitos showa reign the 
era of enlightenment and peace began with his enthronement as 
a living god on christmas day 1926 
akihito born dec 23 1933 was a boy when japans most 
ambitious military campaign of the century ended in disaster in 
1945 japan was shattered its cities firebombed and its people 
starving when hirohito went on the radio to tell a stunned nation 
it had to accept surrender 
at the urging of us occupation authorities hirohito renounced 
his divinity on new years day 1946 and accepted a new 
constitutional role as the symbol of the state and of the unity 
of the people deriving his position from the will of the people 
it was the 12yearold princes new legacy the imperial 
family should always be passive he would say later the most 
important thing is the will of the people 
akihito was formally invested as crown prince in 1952 and the 
next year he began a sixmonth tour of europe and america by 
representing his father at the coronation of britains queen 
elizabeth ii 
his education included precedentsetting attendance at ordinary 
schools and gakushin university as well as tutoring in english 
european languages law and history like his marine biologist 
father science is a major hobby and he has delivered scientific 
papers on the goby fish a mudsucker 
the graying 5foot5 prince appears often among his subjects at 
ceremonies and festivals smiling nodding politely delivering 
carefully tailored speeches in a measured highpitched lisp 
akihito has spent 54 years preparing for his reign its name to 
be chosen by government officials is a closely kept secret for 
many japanese it will be the symbolic start of a modern era free 
of the fetters of war memories that plagued hirohito 
his son has also tasted the bitterness of survivors who fought a 
hopeless war in the name of the emperor in okinawa site of the 
pacific wars fiercest fighting between japanese and american 
troops 1600 people turned out to demonstrate last year against 
hirohitos first scheduled visit to the island 
instead akihito read a statement on behalf of his father 
i feel great sadness and pain when i think of how okinawa 
suffered tremendous damage in the war produced a large number 
of honorable victims including ordinary residents and was forced 
to suffer numerous hardships for a long time after the war he 
read 
some leftists religious groups and war victims continue to 
oppose the existence of the japanese monarchy for akihito it has 
never been a question of choice 
asked once by his american quaker schoolteacher the late 
elizabeth vining what he would be when he grew up the boy prince 
replied i will become emperor 
last year at a rare reception with american journalists he 
confided i dont think i have ever considered what i would wish 
to do as i dont have the experiences of a regular japanese 
citizen and i cant imagine being able to choose another way of 
life

the savings industry dragged down by 
continuing big losses in texas is headed for its worst year since 
the great depression according to a government report 
the federal home loan bank board said thursday that the nations 
thrift institutions lost 75 billion in the first six months of 
1988 almost as much as the 78 billion loss for all of last year 
a postdepression record 
the losses for the year are clearly going to exceed the record 
losses of last year said martin regalia an economist with the 
national council of savings institutions a trade group 
i would say there is a very good chance were going to see 
losses in the 10 billion to 11 billion range and maybe more he 
said 
but both regalia and james barth the bank boards chief 
economist point to signs that the industry is at least not 
deteriorating as rapidly as before 
the sampls loss for the apriljune period of 36 billion was 
modestly better than the 39 billion of red ink in the first 
quarter and the 40 billion loss in the last quarter of 1987 
things are clearly not getting better rapidly but theyre not 
pitching off into the abyss regalia said 
as in the past the industrys losses in the second quarter were 
concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions and in 
texas which has been hard hit by the collapse of oil prices 
the 271 thrift institutions in texas 133 of them insolvent 
accounted for 32 billion of the loss the 20 worst institutions 
in the nation 17 of them in texas lost 26 billion 
barth said most of the secondquarter loss came when 
institutions wrote down bad loans already in their portfolios he 
said operating income was in the black by 225 million for the 
first time since the third quarter of last year that means the 
industry is earning more than its paying in operating expenses 
barth said he suspects there are more loan writedowns or 
nonoperating losses to come but he said i like to think we 
have bottomed out and things wont get much worse 
in texas the vacancy and unemployment rates in the state have 
edged down and construction and oildrilling activity are up barth 
said 
the number of insolvent institutions among 3092 reporting 
slipped from 509 to 497 and the percentage of moneylosing 
institutions fell slightly from 31 percent to 29 percent 
barth declined to offer an assessment of how the industry is 
faring in the current quarter but he noted that about 800 million 
of the secondquarter loss occurred at 60 institutions that have 
since been closed 
the institutions unrealized losses do not go away but they are 
transferred onto the books of the government insurance fund for 
sampls and do not add to the industrys red ink 
however there is at least one factor ahead that could generate 
new losses regalia said the federal reserve board in an effort 
to fight inflation has been pushing up interest rates since last 
march and most economists expect rates to continue to rise during 
the first half of 1989 
we shouldnt see interest rates hurting earnings this year 
there is a lag effect but we should see it by the first half of 
next year he said 
the bank boards earnings report comes as debate is intensifying 
about the need for a taxpayer bailout of the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp which guarantees sampl deposits up to 100000 
the general accounting office said last week that 45 billion to 
50 billion will have to be spent to clean up the industry and 
private projections range up to 100 billion 
senate banking committee chairman william proxmire dwis said 
thursday that taxpayers will have to contribute at least 20 
billion to solve the problem 
at a time when the administration is struggling to reduce the 
federal budget deficit the question of how much must be spent on 
sampls is becoming increasingly critical

a jury that convicted a former mexican 
policeman in the 1985 kidnap and torture murder of a us drug 
enforcement administration agent returned to deliberate on the 
guilt or innocence of two codefendants 
the panel convicted raul lopez alvarez on thursday lopez was 
videotaped telling an undercover officer about events surrounding 
the brutal murder of dea agent enrique camarena whose battered 
body was found along with that of his pilot at a ranch outside 
guadalajara on march 5 1985 
on the videotape the former mexican lawman described the 
slaying of camarena as a mistake by drug baron rafael caro 
quintero adding the idea wasnt to kill him 
after a single days deliberation the jury found lopez 28 
guilty of kidnap murder conspiracy and related crimes in the 
killing of camarena and pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
jurors announced their first verdict thursday morning then 
resumed deliberating for a full day 
they recessed without deciding the cases of two codefendants 
rene verdugo urquidez 36 a confessed drug trafficker and jesus 
felix guttierez who is charged as an accessory after the fact 
the government alleges that guttierez helped the drug baron 
escape from mexico after caro allegedly masterminded camarenas 
murder as revenge for dea raids on the drug barons multimillion 
dollar marijuana operations in mexico 
lopez who grew up in the los angeles area but returned to his 
native mexico was a member of the state judicial police assigned 
to the homicide squad in guadalajara in 1985 
the role of mexican police in the drugrelated murders made the 
case politically sensitive and engendered bitter feelings between 
mexican and american investigators 
lopez was found guilty of six charges including two counts of 
committing violent acts in support of racketeering 
prosecutors said this conviction was the first in the nation 
under that new section of racketeering law aimed at drugrelated 
crimes 
lopez also was found guilty of conspiracy to kidnap kidnapping 
felony murder and accessory after the fact 
lopez lawyer yolanda barrera told jurors in final arguments 
that lopez fabricated the story heard on the videotape from 
accounts he read in newspapers to inflate his own importance to the 
agent he believed was a drug dealer 
she said the only evidence against him was his mouth and 
urged jurors not to believe his statements 
mr lopez alvarez ended up in this trial for acting like a 
child she said he is a man caught up in the web of his own 
lies he told one lie too many 
us district judge edward rafeedie set lopezs sentencing for 
oct 24 he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison 
camarena was abducted feb 7 1985 in guadalajara as he left 
the us consulate to meet his wife for lunch 
the bodies of camarena and his pilot were found buried at a 
remote ranch they were severely beaten and camarenas skull was 
crushed 
nine men were indicted in los angeles in the camarena slaying 
but only three are standing trial here caro 33 and three other 
defendants are in custody and awaiting trial on related charges in 
mexico an eighth man has died and another is a fugitive

one senator was perplexed that it costs more 
to fly across south dakota than across the country 
another said it now costs him 510 to fly home more than four 
times as much as 10 years ago and accommodations are not as good 
and a third suggested theres something wrong when an airline 
controls more than 80 percent of the flights in and out of a city 
the flaws of a deregulated airline industry came under fire 
thursday at a senate commerce committee hearing where no one 
expressed support for returning to the tight government control of 
years past but many suggested that some fine tuning may be in 
order 
my fares have zoomed up up and away and my service has gone 
down said sen ernest hollings dsc chairman of the panel 
he charged that in some parts of the country airlines have 
developed monopoly hubs that allows them to charge passengers 
more for less 
but transportation secretary jim burnley disagreed and declared 
that while the industry may have flaws overall it has become 
much more competitive as to price and service as a result of 
economic deregulation 
since 1978 when congress enacted the airline deregulation act 
domestic air travel has grown from 275 million passengers a year to 
more than 450 million a year while average fares have declined 13 
percent after inflation is taken into account 
but the national statistical averages did little to sooth the 
senators from states where they contend air travel has not 
improved and is now more costly 
hollings said it now costs him 510 to fly from washington to 
charleston sc compared with 120 in 1977 before deregulation 
an airline ticket from aberdeen sd to rapid city sd costs 
269 while a washington to los angeles ticket can cost 269 
complained sen larry pressler rsd 
that is a very bizarre situation he said 
sen john danforth of missouri ranking republican on the 
committee suggested that competition doesnt really exist in 
cities such as st louis minneapolis detroit or pittsburgh where 
single airlines dominate 
congress must determine whether deregulation is truly working 
and if its not working what are we supposed to do about it 
said danforth complaining that in some parts of the country 
single air carriers have gained a lock on an airport leaving 
them free to raise prices and cut service 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress issued a report earlier in the week saying that 82 
percent of the flights in and out of st louis are controlled by 
trans world airlines similar concentrations can be found at 
minneapolisst paul and detroit where northwest airlines is 
dominant and at pittsburgh which is the key hub for usair the 
critics argued 
but burnley said that while he is disappointed more competition 
to twa has not entered the st louis market there is still room 
for competitors at those airports 
not only has new entry by airlines occurred at each of these 
hubs but competing incumbent carriers continue to provide 
competitive service he maintained 
but when pressed by danforth burnley said the department had 
expected more competition to twa at st louis when the department 
approved the twaozark merger he said it had been expected that 
southwest airlines would expand its st louis operation to as much 
as 60 flights a day but the airline today has fewer than two dozen 
flights a day into the city 
id like to know why that has occurred said burnley 
promising the department he would examine the competitive situation 
at the airport 
in separate testimony the architect of airline deregulation 
alfred kahn said he has serious concerns about the mergers that 
have resulted in large airlines dominating some markets but that 
overall the airline industry is today far more competitive than 
it was under regulation 
kahn who was chairman of the nowdefunct civil aeronautics 
board in 1978 when airline deregulation was put in place 
recommended tougher enforcement of antitrust laws 
but he conceded its too late to close the barn door on 
airline mergers now

the prosecutor in lobbyist michael k deavers 
perjury trial says the former presidential aide should be 
imprisoned for lying under oath about his cynical exploitation 
of his white house connections 
independent counsel whitney north seymour jr told us district 
judge thomas penfield jackson that a prison term will have a 
deterrent effect on the ethics and conduct of political insiders 
a sentence of incarceration will warn them that being caught 
lying under oath about their activities will result in their going 
to prison seymour said in a memo submitted for todays 
sentencing 
deaver 50 former deputy white house chief of staff was 
convicted last december of lying to the house energy and commerce 
oversight and investigations subcommittee and a federal grand jury 
impaneled at his request to consider allegations that his lobbying 
violated federal conflictofinterest laws 
deaver faced a possible fiveyear prison term and a 6800 fine 
for each of the three convictions 
his lawyers were expected to argue at todays hearing that their 
client should receive a lenient sentence because of his successful 
battle with alcoholism 
a jury found deaver guilty of lying when he told the grand jury 
he couldnt recall contacting reagan administration officials on 
behalf of major corporations that paid him sixfigure fees to 
represent their interests in washington 
a longtime friend of president reagan and his wife nancy 
deaver also was convicted of lying by denying he helped south 
korean trade envoy kim kihwan get a brief oval office appointment 
to hand reagan a personal letter from president chun doohwan 
seymour said evidence at the trial about deavers lobbying 
revealed a pattern of cynical exploitation of the governmental 
process as a vehicle for private gain 
if the presidents friend can get away with perjury then the 
field is wide open for every one in the privileged class to do the 
same the prosecutor said 
seymour has recommended eliminating what he called loopholes in 
federal ethics laws that prevented him from prosecuting deaver for 
substantive conflictofinterest violations 
the prosecutor said deavers activities were typical of 
government consultants who potentially threaten the 
integrity of government by back door access to public agencies 
during the trial prosecutors presented evidence that deaver 
contacted a number of high government officials including 
secretary of state george shultz and thensecretary of 
transportation elizabeth dole on behalf of major corporations that 
paid his firm sixfigure retainer fees 
last week seymour dismissed defense contentions that deavers 
memory was clouded by alcoholism arguing that he showed 
extraordinary recall about many events about which he was 
questioned

house speaker jim wright is continuing to 
criticize cia efforts to promote unrest in nicaragua and seeking to 
focus attention on what he calls misguided reagan administration 
policies while republicans upbraid him for revealing government 
secrets 
the house ethics committee was meeting today to consider an 
official complaint against wright dtexas that questioned whether 
the speaker violated house rules prohibiting disclosure of 
classified information when he first disclosed the covert cia 
operation on tuesday 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif said the panel 
would have to act on the complaint by house gop leader robert 
michel of illinois and republican conference chairman dick cheney 
of wyoming but he said the issue would be treated separately from 
an existing ethics probe of wright on unrelated matters 
the matter was likely to be complicated by the sensitive nature 
of the information involved michel said if an investigation were 
launched ethics committee staff members would have to gain 
topsecret security clearance to be permitted access to any 
relevant information 
speaking to reporters thursday wright denied that he had broken 
any rules or revealed classified information his disclosure that 
the cia has instigated demonstrations in nicaragua aimed at 
provoking the leftist government could have been gleaned from 
information available publicly he contended 
i didnt say anything that was revealed to me as classified 
information wright said 
but wright was vague when asked how he learned of the covert 
operation instead seeking to focus attention on what he called the 
error of the policy itself 
in late august of last year i became aware that elements of 
the us government were seeking to disturb the domestic 
tranquility in central america to foment disturbances with a view 
to seeing if they could provoke the sandinistas into a crackdown 
that would derail peace talks wright said 
that seems to me just intolerably twofaced he said wright 
added that he had been given indirect assurance that the 
practice has now been halted 
wright attributed the move to investigate him to white house 
pressure on michel but added they lose on this one because we 
are on the side of democracy 
regardless of the outcome the new investigation of wright only 
added to an already long list of woes for the speaker the ethics 
panel formally known as the commitee on standards of official 
conduct already is investigating wright on unrelated allegations 
of financial misconduct 
a house panel on thursday voted to give the committee an 
additional 550000 to pursue that investigation which dixon said 
could continue into next year depending on what is unearthed 
its taking a lot of time said rep john t myers rind 
the senior minority member of the ethics committee it takes a 
lot more indepth investigation than we ever anticipated 
the latest controversy prompted harsh criticism of wright by 
republican members of congress including a primary senate sponsor 
of legislation to tighten congress control over covert cia 
activities 
the senator william cohen of maine said the speakers comments 
had apparently violated nondisclosure rules and jeopardized the 
bill 
the clear implication is that the speakers statement 
could only have been derived from classified information in the 
possession of the house intelligence committee cohen said the 
speaker owes his colleagues in congress and the american people an 
explanation 
cohen the vice chairman of the senate intelligence committee 
said the disclosure also could doom opposition members who are 
jailed for antigovernment protests to longer prison terms or a 
harsher fate and would give the sandinistas an enormous 
propaganda boost 
and rep olympia snowe rmaine called the action 
inexcusable 
this government simply cannot function if each individual 
member of congress takes it upon him or herself to decide what 
can be declassified she said 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash said the 
legislation to require notice to congress of covert actions within 
48 hours which had been due to come before the house next week 
might be put off until the following week because of the press of 
other legislation

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev is 
proposing that interim limits be placed on the most potent us and 
soviet longrange nuclear weapons to keep arms control momentum 
going us officials say 
gorbachevs proposal was sent to the state department before 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze began talks thursday 
with secretary of state george p shultz on a wide range of arms 
control measures human rights and regional problems 
the us side is willing to consider the proposal but will 
emphasize that any limitations on nuclear weapons must be 
reinforced with strict verification measures to guard against 
violations the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said thursday 
these include assurances there will be no interference with the 
monitoring of test flights of the strategic nuclear missiles that 
carry the warheads and have ranges of 3500 miles and beyond 
after a session today with vice president george bush and 
another round with shultz concentrating on problems in the middle 
east southern africa and southeast asia the soviet foreign 
minister had a session scheduled at the white house with president 
reagan 
a joint statement was to be issued then to mark the progress 
thats been achieved and shultz and shevardnadze were to hold 
separate news conferences in the evening a us official said 
it was not clear whether an agreement on temporary ceilings 
could be reached during the twoday visit the soviets did not 
raise the proposal in the first sessions on thursday the us 
official said 
the united states and the soviet union set goals for limiting 
warheads at the summit last december gorbachev wants to put those 
limits into effect on an interim basis separate from other arms 
issues 
these would include a ceiling of 10 warheads on us 
groundlaunched mx missiles and eight on submarinelaunched 
tridents while the soviets would be held to 10 warheads on their 
ss18 and ss20 missiles the official said 
shevardnadze carried a range of other arms control proposals to 
shultz along with a letter from gorbachev to reagan 
the agenda is very broad but we have little time 
shevardnadze told reporters 
he singled out two obstacles to a strategic arms reduction 
treaty start as included in the fullscope negotiations he 
was holding with shultz they involved restrictions to be imposed 
on the range of nonballistic cruise missiles that can be launched 
by bombers and warships and ways of verifying that any agreedupon 
cutbacks on their number are not exceeded 
shultz met with shevardnadze for 6 hours and afterward 
described their discussion of arms control issues and human rights 
as very constructive and very detailed 
negotiators in geneva have been unable to resolve these 
problems as well as related questions dealing with reagans 
strategic defense initiative the search for a spacebased shield 
against soviet ballistic missiles 
immediately after shultz greeted shevardnadze teams of us and 
soviet experts began private deliberations on the twin issues of 
reducing strategic nuclear weapons and on antimissile defenses 
veteran american and soviet negotiators paul h nitze and viktor p 
karpov headed their respective delegations 
shevardnadze also singled out hopedfor reductions in 
conventional weapons in europe as a major item on the soviet 
agenda we want to see where we are where we stand and what the 
prospects are he said we believe there are some good 
prospects 
negotiations in vienna are stalled over us demands that the 
soviets give equal weight to human rights in any negotiations 
between the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
to reduce troops tanks and other conventional armaments from the 
atlantic ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
we have specific proposals in many areas shevardnadze said 
adding that the discussions in washington would cover nuclear and 
space weapons and conventional armaments and chemical weapons as 
well 
even before shevardnadzes arrival some us officials were 
optimistic that an agreement could be reached on verifying 
compliance with a 1976 treaty to limit underground nuclear tests 
for socalled peaceful purposes to 150 kilotons 
the idea is to clear the way for reagan to submit the treaty to 
the senate for ratification before he leaves office in january 
wrapping up a treaty to reduce longrange nuclear missiles is a 
much tougher and more important task reagan had hoped to complete 
the accord during his second term as evidence that he is committed 
to rolling back the nuclear arms race 
on thursday an armenian demonstrator managed to get 
shevardnadzes attention during a break in the foreign ministers 
talks with shultz 
amvarsam khlgatian 61 had been standing for two hours across 
the street carrying a placard that readgorbachev let me visit 
my dying mother 
as shevardnadzes motorcade started for the soviet embassy the 
man dashed into the street carrying his sign the motorcade stopped 
and security agents wrestled khlgatian to the ground 
shevardnadze left his limousine to talk to the demonstrator for 
a few minutes 
he said dont worry ill take care of it khlgatian said 
afterward but he can do nothing its up to the kgb 
the protester said he was exiled from the soviet union in 1979 
after serving 15 years in labor camps for attempting to escape to 
the west he said he works as a machinist in new york 
khlgatian gave shevardnadze a leaflet in which he described his 
mother as 80 years old and fatally ill it said gorbachev despite 
promises of humanization had kept him from visiting her in 
yerevan the armenian capital

cavoli now a secondyear medical student at the university of 
buffalo said he feared that the challenger disaster would put an 
end to manned space exploration 
i was afraid people would say it wasnt worthwhile he said 
thursday at a news conference in buffalo i think it is a lot of 
problems we have on earth can be solved in space 
cavolis project involves growing crystals under zerogravity 
conditions he theorizes that gravity creates currents in chemical 
solutions that disrupt formation of crystals he said leadiodide 
crystals formed in space might be larger and purer and lead to 
improved film for xrays and improved semiconductors in computers 
cavoli 24 first thought of the experiment as a high school 
student while he attended union college in schenectady school 
officials sponsored the experiment spending more than 14000 
union chemistry professor charles scaife helped cavoli refine 
the experiment and rebuild the equipment destroyed in the explosion 
the project is one of only two student experiments being 
conducted by discovery astronauts other experiments that were part 
of the challenger mission have been cancelled by nasa 
cavoli was in washington watching a broadcast of the challenger 
launch when the space shuttle blew up killing the seven astronauts 
aboard president reagan had planned to single him out as a young 
american hero in his annual state of the union address 
originally scheduled for that evening 
just after the disaster cavoli was in the oval office with the 
president and three others scheduled to be saluted in the address 
he was just like the rest of us in shock cavoli said he 
was very somber in the beginning but then he tried to pick things 
up a bit for the sake of the rest of us 
cavoli returned a week later to be recognized when the speech 
was rescheduled he sat with first lady nancy reagan and stood as 
congress applauded

airlines have been ordered to equip their jet 
fleets over the next four years with devices to help pilots escape 
deadly wind shears that have been linked to five major accidents 
and more than 500 deaths in the last decade 
the federal aviation administration announced the new 
requirements on thursday they call for a phasein of the wind 
shear detection equipment on more than 3600 jetliners by late 1992 
powerful shears called microbursts have been called the no 1 
killer of airline passengers and have been responsible for 18 
airline accidents and 575 deaths since 1970 
the faa regulation was announced by the transportation 
department and covers any commercial jetliner with 30 or more 
seats the department estimated the cost to the airlines at between 
40000 ando 50000 per airplane 
a microburst is a powerful downburst of air caused by a sudden 
change in wind direction that can literally drive a jetliner into 
the ground if encountered during an approach or departure 
in 1985 a microburst struck a delta air lines l1011 as it was 
attempting to land at dallasfort worth causing a crash that 
killed 134 people a pan american world airways jet encountered a 
strong shear while trying to take off from the new orleans airport 
in 1982 and crashed killing 154 people 
the delta accident focused increased attention on developing and 
installing sophisticated ground radar that would provide advanced 
warning of shears along departure and approach lanes but the radar 
is not expected to be available until the early 1990s and then only 
at a relatively small number of airports 
at the same time the faa and industry began examining training 
methods to help pilots detect a shear and possibly escape although 
most pilots say there are microbursts that cannot be flown through 
if encountered at a low altitude such as during a takeoff or 
approach 
the technology to help pilots escape a shear has been available 
for several years piedmont airlines two years ago began installing 
the equipment being required by the faa and today has the devices 
in 112 of its 191 aircraft according to piedmont spokesman mike 
clark 
but some airline executives and pilots question the value of the 
devices 
the critics note that the equipment is not a radar and thus 
would only help a pilot recognize when the plane already has flown 
into wind shear conditions by then it may be too late to escape if 
the plane is close to the ground they maintain 
transportation secretary jim burnley in announcing the new 
requirements said the equipment will enhance safety by giving 
pilots a valuable tool for coping with the dangerous wind shear 
phenomenon 
experience has shown that pilots can recover successfully from 
wind shear encounters if they can recognize the situation quickly 
enough and have sufficient information to execute escape 
maneuvers he said in a statement 
the faa regulation says half of an airlines fleet must have the 
devices within 27 months threefourths of the fleet within 39 
months and the rest of the fleet within 51 months 
the rule also requires airlines to provide pilots with increased 
training on wind shear recognition and recovery procedures while 
using the new equipment

tightened restrictions on textile apparel and 
shoe imports appear set for final house approval but president 
reagan is expected to veto the measure 
the textile and apparel industry probably has the least 
persuasive case for further import restriction of any major 
industry in this country seven cabinet officials said thursday 
night in a letter to lawmakers 
the house was set to vote today on the measure which would 
freeze this years imports of textiles and apparel at 1987 levels 
and limit future growth to 1 percent a year nonrubber footwear 
imports would be capped indefinitely at 1987 levels 
the measure designed mainly to shield domestic producers from 
foreign competition also would establish a pilot program under 
which the government would auction import licenses 
to build support from the farm lobby the measure includes a 
guarantee that any country increasing its purchases of us 
agricultural products would get a break on textile and apparel 
quotas korea and other asian textileproducing nations are among 
the largest purchasers of american grain and other farm goods 
the house passed a version of the bill a year ago it was voting 
today on a move to accept four senate changes the import license 
auctions the farmgoods provision a change in the base year for 
the freeze from 1986 to 1987 and special restrictions on shipments 
of foreignmade silk neckties 
supporters of the textile apparel and shoe industries say the 
bill is needed to protect american jobs that otherwise will be lost 
as imported textiles flood the us market they point to heavy 
layoffs amid a surge in foreignmade goods that that entered the 
country in the early 1980s 
the reagan administration counters that the textile industry is 
flourishing and that the layoffs came about largely because the 
manufacturers adopted automated production methods to become more 
competitive in the face of stepped up competition 
if this bill is passed we and the presidents other senior 
advisors will recommend that he veto it said a letter to 
lawmakers thursday from us trade representative clayton k 
yeutter and six other cabinet officers 
they said the measure would be extremely harmful to our 
country it would hurt us consumers it would provoke retaliation 
against us exports violate our international obligations and 
undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for us 
exports 
the veto threat was viewed as unlikely to budge supporters and 
the administration was expecting the bill on reagans desk within 
days 
he wouldnt veto it until next week white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater told reporters earlier thursday 
reagan vetoed a similar bill in 1985 and an override attempt 
that was deferred seven months to move it closer to congressional 
elections failed to gain the twothirds support needed 
rep ed jenkins dga occupant of the textile seat on the 
house ways and means committee said last week he hoped reagan 
would relent and sign but if the president could not be budged he 
said he wanted to force reagan to use his veto pen one more time 
rather than killing it through inaction with a pocket veto 
after congress adjourns 
on the eve of the house vote rep butler derrick dsc said 
there were a number of people who have told us they arent going 
to vote with us tomorrow but have agreed to vote for an override 
he said he believed that textile forces were about 14 short 
of the twothirds support needed for a veto override he said 
however that the override attempt would not be mounted in the 
house before the first week in october and thus we have 10 days 
to work on that

the house adopted legislation that could make 
americans pay dearly for possessing a single marijuana cigarette or 
a small bag of cocaine and the senate must decide whether to 
follow suit 
the drugfighting bill passed the house on a bipartisan 37530 
vote thursday after minority republicans molded the legislation to 
target drug users for special punishment 
those who consider themselves recreational users could under 
the bill lose student loans public housing and other federal 
benefits face civil penalties of up to 10000 for each drug 
possession violation and have their drivers licenses suspended if 
their states participate in a proposed drug enforcement grant 
program 
up to now the war on drugs meant a war on the drug pushers 
the drug kingpins said rep mickey edwards rokla author of 
the 10000 civil penalty what we did was to declare a war 
on the use of drugs in america 
the senate eager to quit to campaign for reelection is still 
trying to write a bill for introduction and will have to race the 
adjournment clock to pass legislation in time to work out any 
differences with the house 
the senates wideopen debate usually without time limits 
could work against completion of the bill this year only the pull 
of an upcoming election might cause senators to break into a trot 
on the bill 
the legislation pursues many avenues of combatting illegal 
drugs and would authorize the addition of more than 2 billion in 
spending to the nations current 39 billion antidrug effort if 
all the money is actually appropriated the amount could be a 
factor if overall spending levels force acrosstheboard automatic 
budget cuts 
the houses most liberal members refused to support that 
chambers bill after it emerged laden down with harsh gopinspired 
penalties one of their number rep don edwards dcalif said 
americans will be less free under the legislation which he 
called a shameful excessive electionyear disgrace 
the bill introduced in the house two weeks ago included 
increased money for state and local law enforcement requirements 
for drugfree workplaces by government contractors and grants for 
education treatment and rehabilitation among other provisions 
it emerged with the severe penalties for drug users along with 
constitutional procedures to permit the federal death penalty 
against anyone who kills during a drugrelated crime 
the drug bills hardliners suffered their only defeat thursday 
when the house refused to support withholding of highway money from 
states that refused to suspend drivers licenses of convicted drug 
offenders 
but they still won half a loaf when lawmakers adopted a 
substitute that turned the penalty into an incentive program 
lawmakers voted 281119 to authorize 125 million over three years 
to states willing to enact laws suspending or revoking drivers 
licenses for those convicted of any drug offense 
the bill received support from 207 democrats and 168 
republicans while all 30 votes against the legislation came from 
democrats but supporters of the overall bill had problems too 
we took a lot of provisions of dubious constitutionality 
said rep william j hughes chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime hughes who voted for the legislation said 
he hoped lawmakers could clean up some of the language in a 
housesenate conference 
president reagan asked upon arrival in houston whether he was 
pleased by the passage of the bill smiled and said yes 
rep don edwards said americans freedoms would be injured by 
language allowing admission of illegally seized evidence in 
federal cases if officers acted in the good faith belief they 
were behaving lawfully 
the death penalty provision because if current practice in 
the states is any guide that power will be exercised in a racially 
discriminatory manner the language also includes a minimum 
20year sentence for killings in drugrelated crimes 
the denial of federal assistance to the poor and the 
addicted by making them ineligible for student loans public 
housing and other benefits for two drug convictions veterans 
benefits could be denied for one drug distribution conviction that 
resulted in a oneyear prison term retirement welfare health and 
disability assistance of all types would be exempted 
the civil penalties of 10000 per violation for any possession 
of illegal drugs which would require clear and convincing 
proof rather than the stricter beyond a reasonable doubt 
standard in criminal cases the provision lacks the procedural 
protections guaranteed by the bill of rights edwards said

the united states has ended all aid to burma 
except emergency humanitarian assistance citing political unrest 
in the southeast asian nation 
burma has been rocked in recent months by widespread 
prodemocracy protests that have been suppressed ruthlessly this 
week by leaders of a military coup last weekend 
in light of the current unsettled political conditions in 
burma we are unable to continue our assistance programs there for 
the time being state department spokesman rudi boone said 
thursday 
accordingly we are halting further aid other than emergency 
humanitarian assistance until conditions permit a resumption he 
said reading from a state department statement we hope that 
that will be soon and we look forward to renewing cooperation with 
burma and the burmese people 
boone said he believed us aid to burma totaled 123 million 
but he did not know how much of the aid is for emergency 
humanitarian assistance 
whatever emergency humanitarian assistance there is theres 
precious little of it said robert hathaway spokesman for rep 
stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs 
he pegged the total aid to burma at 14 million 
they were authorized almost 7 million in antinarcotics aid 
and 7 million in developmental assistance he said noting that 
since the fiscal year ends sept 30 im not sure how much of 
that money has not yet been expended 
hathaway said solarz who recently visited burma en route home 
from moscow and beijing would support the cutoff of aid as a 
symbol of our commitment to the democratic cause and a symbol of 
our uneasiness or worse uneasiness really isnt a strong enough 
word of the course of events of the last few days in particular 
the bloodshed and deaths 
months of prodemocracy demonstrations led to the resignation in 
late july of ne win who seized power in 1962 and whose 
authoritarian rule turned resourcerich burma into a land of 
poverty 
gen saw maung who became prime minister wednesday after 
leading a military coup sunday is the third new leader in two 
months of chaos and bloodshed 
sein lwin succeeded ne win but lasted for only 17 days of 
massive protests before maung maung took over he was a civilian 
but was viewed as close to the military 
saw maung who is closely associated with ne win has pledged to 
hold elections as soon as peace is restored 
since the coup the government has acknowledged security forces 
killed at least 146 people but a western diplomat has said at 
least 400 have been slain including many unarmed prodemocracy 
demonstrators 
opposition leaders sent saw maung a letter thursday urging the 
government not to arrest people including the monks students 
artists etc in connection with the recent unrest and also to 
release those already under detention 
solarz introduced a resolution unanimously approved by the 
house on sept 7 urging democratic change in burma 
the resolution called for the establishment of a transitional 
body consisting of burmese citizens who are unquestionably 
committed to democracy and who have the confidence of the burmese 
people to organize the holding of multiparty elections and 
otherwise facilitate the establishment of a genuinely democratic 
government

most americans are at relatively low risk of 
aids from sexual contact but the hundreds of thousands who still 
have sex with multiple partners are at considerable risk 
according to a new nationwide survey 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
a survey shows that more than 80 percent of respondents have had 
either one or no sex partners in the previous year 
nevertheless a sizeable percentage of young nevermarried 
men report more than 10 partners in the past 12 months including 
5 percent of those age 1829 
the survey interviewed 1481 people in a scientific sample 
asking them to submit written anonymous answers to four questions 
about their sexual habits 
three percent of the 638 men interviewed both single and 
married reported five to 10 sex partners in the previous year one 
in 100 reported more than 10 including 3 percent of the men 
between 18 and 29 1 percent of the men 3044 and 2 percent of the 
men 4560 
this is something that concerns us said dr william darrow 
a cdc aids specialist youre talking about millions of people 
and we dont know whether theyre taking other kinds of 
precautions such as discussing aids testing with partners and 
using condoms 
applied to the us population the survey indicates more than 
700000 single men aged 1829 and more than 100000 aged 3044 may 
have 10 or more partners a year thus leaving themselves at 
considerable risk of aids the cdc said 
among the 843 women surveyed 07 percent said they had five or 
more partners in the past year that included 1 percent of those 
aged 1829 04 percent of those aged 3044 and 07 percent of 
those 4560 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread chiefly through 
sexual contact or the sharing of drug needles persons with 
multiple sex partners are considered at increased risk for the 
deadly disease more than 70000 us cases have been reported and 
federal health officials believe as many as 15 million americans 
are infected with the virus that can cause aids 
overall 22 percent of the respondents said they had had no sex 
partners in the previous year and 60 percent reported only one 
partner eleven percent said two to four 2 percent said five or 
more and 6 percent did not answer the question 
most americans appear to be at relatively low risk of 
infection from the virus that causes aids the cdc said darrow 
said that particularly includes the 80 percent who reported one sex 
partner or none in the last year 
people also were asked about the status of their sex partners 
their gender and whether they were spouses friends pickups or 
prostitutes 
six percent of the men and 1 percent of the women surveyed said 
at least one of their sex partners in the previous year was a 
casual date or pickup well below 1 percent reported paying 
for sex 
of the men reporting sex in the previous year 3 percent said 
their partners included males and another 6 percent didnt answer 
the question homosexual men make up the largest group of aids 
patients in the united states 
cdc researchers really didnt know what to expect from the 
survey darrow said noting there have been no definitive 
scientific sexual behavior studies in recent years the 
groundbreaking kinsey report on sexual behavior is now 40 years 
old and was too unscientifically based 
the survey reported thursday included adults living in 
households prisoners and transients were not included and they 
may be at greater risk darrow said 
the survey was conducted by the national opinion research 
center a private center which has conducted surveys on social 
issues since 1972 the center receives funding from the national 
science foundation and shared its research with federal health 
officials darrow said 
the survey was conducted between feb 14 and april 25 the 
margin of error varies from finding to finding depending on a 
number of variables but is believed to be less than 4 percent 
overall norc researchers said

continental airlines has been awarded the 
highly contested and lucrative air route between seattle and tokyo 
after two years of controversy a court challenge and questions 
about possible conflict of interest 
united airlines which currently flies the route said it would 
ask the transportation department to reconsider its decision which 
came thursday american airlines also had been in the running to 
win the route on a permanent basis 
the decision by the transporation department came after the 
justice department refused to challenge a federal court decision 
which in august ordered the route given to continental according 
to a highranking transportation department official 
the official who asked not to be identified said 
transportation secretary jim burnley had argued strongly to appeal 
the case but that justice spurned the idea 
he burnley believes we could have had the court opinion 
reversed on appeal the official said 
the department made no formal announcement of its order 
opponents of the ruling have 10 days to petition the department 
to reconsider its decision said dot spokesman bob marks he said 
the provision for a reconsideration request is standard in such 
cases 
in chicago united issued a statement saying it was encouraged 
that the ruling allowed for a reconsideration request adding that 
the company strongly believes that the merits of the case clearly 
support uniteds retention of the route 
a department administrative law judge had recommended 
continental for the route originally but a succession of senior 
department officials disagreed chosing at one point united and 
then american 
before a final decision could be made a federal appeals court 
ruled in late august that the original administrative law judges 
recommendation should stand continental had filed suit because it 
had not been given the route 
the seattletokyo route previously had been flown by pan 
american world airways but united assumed the route temporarily 
when it purchased pan ams pacific division in 1986 
the transportation department approved uniteds acquisition of 
the pan am routes only under the condition that the seattletokyo 
route be dealt with separately 
last year a dot administrative law judge recommended that the 
route be given to continental but that recommendation was subject 
to review by a senior department official designated to deal with 
international air routes 
the official vance fort then deputy assistant secretary for 
policy and international affairs disagreed and recommended united 
later however a conflict of interst problem arose because fort 
at the time had been negotiating for employment at flying tiger 
airlines which stood to benefit depending on which airline got the 
seattletokyo route 
although no action was taken against fort the case was returned 
to another administrative law judge who also recommended that 
united keep the route but that decision was overruled by forts 
successor who recommended american 
the department was about to make a final decision presumably 
american when the federal court ruling on continentals suit 
intervened

a bill to expand voluntary aids testing among 
highrisk individuals neared house passage with wide bipartisan 
majorities turning back proposals to force tests on prisoners 
hospital patients and marriage license applicants 
lawmakers also defeated by a large margin a proposal requiring 
states to collect identifying information on people who test 
positive for the aids virus 
opponents successfully argued that anonymous testing is a much 
better way to attract people at highest risk of being infected with 
aids and that testing resources need to be concentrated on those 
people rather than populations that probably havent been exposed 
lets not take limited resources and waste them said 
rep henry waxman dcalif chief sponsor of the testing measure 
let the states do their own efforts as they see fit 
the waxman bill would give states complying with its terms an 
extra 400 million a year to conduct widespread voluntary aids 
testing and counseling 
it also would protect the confidentiality of counseling and 
testing records speed up research into acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome and create a national commission to advise congress on 
issues raised by the fatal disease 
final house action could come as early as today the bill then 
goes to the senate 
the human rights campaign fund a political action committee for 
the gay and lesbian community praised the house for rejecting what 
it called hostile amendments proposed by rep william dannemeyer 
rcalif and other conservatives 
members of the house have sent a clear signal to rep 
dannemeyer and others who support irrational punitive aids actions 
that the time has come for responsible aids policy the funds 
executive director vic basile said in a statement 
the virus that causes aids a fatal disease most often is 
spread through close contact with contaminated blood products or 
semen its principal victims have been homosexuals and intravenous 
drug users 
the house agreed to require testing of prisoners convicted of 
prostitution or crimes related to sexual assault or iv drug abuse 
the plan was approved 266137 as an alternative to mandatory 
testing of all prisoners 
amendments defeated thursday included 
a proposal to require testing of all marriage license 
applicants in states where the incidence of aids infection is over 
one in 1000 sponsored by rep bill mccollum rfla it lost 
30491 
rep edward madigan rill said his states program has 
identified nine applicants infected with aids out of 75000 people 
tested at a cost to newlyweds of 400000 for each identified 
case he said the governor has requested it be repealed 
rep lindy boggs dla said her state repealed its requirement 
after a year because it was an economic hardship produced a 
significant number of false positive tests and did nothing for 
those groups at highest risk lets not force our mistake on the 
rest of the nation she said 
a proposal to require hospitals in highincidence states to 
test virtually all inpatients between ages 15 and 50 sponsored by 
dannemeyer it lost 30289 health workers are expected to treat 
all patients as infected and protect themselves accordingly 
madigan said 
a proposal to require reporting of aidsinfected individuals 
with enough information to locate them another dannemeyer 
initiative it lost 32770 
proponents accused congress of ignoring the need for information 
on the epidemic but opponents said demographic data on 
aidsinfected people must be reported under the bill and 
identifying information would drive people underground 
the lawmakers cited the case of oregon where a switch to 
anonymous testing resulted in a 125 percent increase in the number 
of homosexual men being tested and a 56 percent increase in the 
number of prostitutes tested they also noted that in south 
carolina a switch to name reporting resulted in a 51 percent drop 
in the number of homosexual men being tested at a charleston site

a ruling by the nuclear regulation commission 
raises the possibility that the idled seabrook nh reactor may 
never be allowed to operate commercially 
the commission said thursday that before receiving a lowpower 
license the financially troubled seabrook owners must prove they 
can pay for decommissioning the reactor in the event they 
eventually fail to gain a fullpower license 
in a unanimous vote without debate the commissioners ordered 
seabrook to submit a plan within 30 days that provides reasonable 
assurance that adequate funds will be available so that safe 
decommissioning will be reasonably assured 
seabrook officials expressed optimism that they would be able to 
satisfy the commissioners 
were in the process of answering those questions right now 
and were confident this wont be an issue barring us from 
lowpower testing said ronald a sher spokesman for new 
hampshire yankee the plants operator 
some opponents said they too expected the nrc to approve the 
companys decommissioning plan 
its not very hard to satisfy the nrc if youre a nuclear 
utility said robert backus a new hampshire attorney for the 
seacoast antipollution league 
but others said they were cautiously optimistic about the agency 
they regularly criticize for being too soft on the nuclear industry 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon who opposes an 
operating license for seabrook said the ruling was frankly 
unexpected by us and makes us feel that as this goes along theyre 
going to pay closer attention to the finacial stability 
a ruling on the decommissioning question could not come until 
midnovember at the earliest 
seabrook officials said they have no estimate on decommissioning 
costs but said lowpower testing would add about 4 million to the 
cost opponents disputed that figure saying it was much too low 
the commission also has to resolve the separate question of 
whether seabrooks owners are financially fit to operate the plant 
martin malsch the nrc deputy general counsel said the agency 
hopes to settle that matter within a month 
the two financial qualification issues represent the only 
regulatory obstacles remaining in seabrooks prolonged quest for a 
license that would allow the owners to test the reactor at 5 
percent of power lowpower testing is a necessary step to 
obtaining a commercial license to operate the plant at full power 
the license is also pivotal for seabrook opponents they say the 
5 percent testing would contaminate the reactor with radioactive 
fuel making it much more difficult to convert the plant to a 
gasfired facility or to decommission it

to hear michael dukakis aides describe it 
george bush is a worldclass debater who gobbled up his republican 
opponents every time he sat down with them during the 1988 primary 
campaign 
but the bush campaign begs to differ facts are facts 
dukakis strongest suit is debate format says the vice 
presidents campaign manager lee atwater recalling the democrats 
experience as host of a television discussion program in the 1970s 
this is not a sudden outbreak of pleasantries on the rough and 
tumble campaign trail to the white house instead its part of a 
grand strategy leading to sundays kickoff debate of the fall 
campaign with each side trying to inflate the other candidate to 
the status of political giant so their own man can come out looking 
like a giant killer 
thats not the end of it either as bush and dukakis point 
toward sundays 90minute setto in winstonsalem nc the first 
of two presidential debates this fall 
both men must try to win not so much the debate itself as the 
news coverage of the debate afterward says larry mccarthy a 
republican political consultant not involved with bushs campaign 
that means carefully scripted highly quotable utterances that 
make the candidate look strong and convey his message and will be 
rebroadcast time after time after time in the network news coverage 
that follows the debate 
and it means a smile isnt just a smile 
even the reactions will probably be staged while the other 
candidate is talking in case the gestures are being recorded by 
another camera he said 
the psychological warfare isnt confined to manipulating the 
public expectations of the two men 
i wouldnt be surprised if they have a big batch of bush 
supporters outside the hall so all he dukakis sees when he enters 
the hall are bush signs mccarthy said 
many republicans and democrats say dukakis probably has more to 
gain in the debate and bush has more to lose thats because the 
vice president has held the momentum in recent weeks and the trends 
in the polls have been his way 
dukakis advisers say the most important thing for him is to 
appear presidential an elusive illdefined quality if he is to 
succeed while republicans say bush must avoid a major gaffe that 
would reverse the gains he has made in recent weeks 
the public has got to look at this man and think hes 
presidential says francis obrien a dukakis adviser its a 
cumulative thing you sit there and you look at what he says and 
how he looks if you can cross that threshhold thats an enormous 
leg up for a candidate for president 
watch dukakis behavior says republican consultant eddie mahe 
if he is constantly on the attack it is a sign that he too 
believes the republicans are headed for victory unless he can 
succeed in rattling bush if he is less aggressive it probably 
means he believes the race has settled back down and he has time to 
make his points mahe added 
mahe who is not involved in preparing the vice president for 
the debate says all george bush has to do is as he did in 
earlier debates and be a natural and reassured and deliberate 
individual 
he recommends bush begin his answers with a positive statement 
about his own views and then wind up with a critical comment about 
dukakis 
bush successfully deflected potentially embarrassing questions 
dealing with the irancontra affair and taxes during the primary 
debates and mahe says he can and should be able to anticipate 
anything dukakis throws at him 
you have to avoid being strident i would try to have thought 
through every possible line of attack and they are calculable 
noriega offshore oil drilling 
leslie dach dukakis communications adviser says this isnt a 
make or break event it isnt like 1984 when if the democratic 
candidate didnt knock the other guys lights out he was history 
he said 
michael dukakis will be tough and hell be engaged but we 
dont have a haymaker strategy 
atwater agrees that the debate isnt the end of the world one 
way or another he adds as long as the candidates are 
discussing the issues its to george bushs favor 
peter hart a democratic pollster says that for bush the big 
thing is to be able to be consistent and to be able to say 
something that goes beyond being peripheral and negative and 
establish himself as an independent political force apart from 
president reagan 
mccarthy who worked for sen bob dole during the republican 
primaries said bush needs to come off as having more of a 
positive message than weve seen from him recently 
dukakis has to be relaxed and warm and have a couple of good 
funny lines at bushs expense he said

the government is back in the business of 
selling thousands of singlefamily houses to the highest bidder 
but human rights groups are demanding that they be used to shelter 
the nations homeless 
department of housing and urban development officials said 
thursday they expect sale contracts to be signed for 2500 houses 
within the next few days and most such sales are to families with 
lowtomoderate incomes 
about 27000 hudowned houses across the country went back on 
the market thursday morning following u s district judge oliver 
gaschs refusal to extend a ban on their sale contracts on the 
2500 were almost ready to be signed when gasch issued a temporary 
restraining order three weeks ago 
hud houses average 45000 and are being sold in nearly every 
state although very few are available in the northeast or in areas 
where houses sell for more than 100000 said jim nistler hud 
deputy assistant secretary 
we are deeply disappointed said florence roisman counsel 
for the national housing law project which has sued to stop sale 
of the 7000 houses monthly that hud acquires through default of 
federal housing administrationbacked loans 
we consider that when the government owns empty homes and 
millions of children are growing up in ugly hurtful deprived 
environments both law and common decency require that the 
government should use those homes to house those families ms 
roisman said 
a national academy of sciences report released monday estimated 
there are more than 100000 children among 735000 homeless on any 
given night hud puts the total number of homeless people at 
450000 while advocacy groups say there are as many as 3 million 
government lawyers argued that stopping the hud home sales would 
bankrupt the fhas home mortgage insurance fund which receives its 
financing from the sales and from the 38 percent fee buyers pay 
for fhabacked mortgages 
hud general counsel j michael dorsey said the insurance fund 
would be bankrupt by 1990 if the sales were stopped hud says it 
has received 24 billion from the house sales since the beginning 
of the fiscal year last oct 1 
dorsey estimated that the threeweek ban on sales imposed by the 
court order cost hud 500000 in maintenance fees and other 
expenses for the unsold houses 
dorsey said 70 percent of the hud houses are purchased by people 
who are going to live in them and most of those were families with 
lowtomoderate incomes 
the remainder are sold to investors he said most of whom say 
they will either sell or rent the home within a year 
houses are sold usually through real estate agents by sealed 
bids which are opened 10 days after a house is advertised 
jim stimpson hud expert on homeless policy said about 400 of 
the hudowned houses have been sold at a discount to agencies 
providing living space for the homeless 
hud has a program that allows the houses to be sold for use by 
the homeless at as low as 60 percent of value depending on how 
long they are on the market stimpson said 
but homeless advocates say the federal government has not done 
enough to turn over space it owns to people who have been living in 
the streets or temporary shelters 
i dont think hud is supposed to be in the real estate 
business said maria foscarinis counsel for the national 
coalition for the homeless which has a separate suit trying to 
force the agency to inventory all government buildings that might 
be used by the homeless 
she said the coalition does not expect the government to simply 
turn over all the houses and empty government buildings but a 
lot of local nongovernment nonprofit agencies are desperate for 
buildings in which to operate programs for the homeless 
its clear she said that the federal government would 
rather sell its property in order to generate money

as many as twothirds of the nations children 
are free from tooth decay but other dental health problems remain 
unsolved federal health researchers said thursday 
preliminary results from a 198687 survey of us schoolchildren 
show more than 65 percent of the nations 9yearold children free 
of tooth decay the national centers for disease control reported 
in a 197980 survey the figure was 49 percent 
the downward trend in dental caries tooth decay in us 
schoolchildren has been occurring over the past two decades the 
decline has occurred in all age groups and all regions of the 
country the cdc said in its weekly report 
but the cdc said tooth decay remains a persistent problem for 
some highrisk groups including poor children and minority 
children 
and while federal health officials goal of no tooth decay in 40 
percent of the nations 9yearold children has been surpassed 
three of 11 other dentalhealth goals for 1990 are unlikely to be 
reached the cdc said one other objective has been reached 
progress is being made toward four and information is not 
sufficient to assess the other three the atlantabased agency said 
we have indications that the dental health of children has 
improved and were very encouraged by that said dr susan 
szpunar a cdc dental health specialist but its something we 
have to look at with cautious optimism there are still a lot of 
dental health problems in the population which need to be taken 
care of 
the trend in dental health in the united states which the cdc 
termed positive and encouraging could be an omen to a new 
problem she said 
the problem right now is people saying that if their kids 
arent getting cavities they dont have to go to the dentist 
she said another problem is communities that fluoridate water 
supplies saying should we keep fluoridating 
thats a real dangerous question the reason for the 
improvement is the kids are getting it fluoride if it stops 
well probably see a reverse 
in addition to reducing tooth decay in children the nation has 
according to the cdc achieved one other dental health goal for 
1990 making threequarters of us adults aware of the need for 
good personal oral hygiene and regular professional care to control 
periodontal disease 
three of the 12 goals are not likely to be met by 1990 the cdc 
said having no schools or healthcare facilities offering 
cavitycausing foods having all school athletes wear recommended 
mouth guards and having 95 percent of the people with community 
water getting fluoridation 
the cdc noted that removing sugar from schools would mean an end 
to band candy sales and thats difficult to tell people to 
do ms szpunar said only three college sports require mouth 
guards football hockey and mens lacrosse and only 62 percent 
of the population on community water get fluoride 
progress has been made toward four other goals the cdc said 
reducing gingivitis gum inflammation and destructive 
periodontal disease in adults to around 20 percent making 95 
percent of schoolchildren and parents aware of the risk factors for 
dental disease and the benefits of fluoride having a system in 
place to monitor us dental health and having systems in place to 
monitor publichealth preventive measures 
the cdc said insufficient information is available to assess 
progress in three other areas gingivitis in children getting 
fluoride to children who arent on community water systems and 
improving childrens personal dental hygiene

the state department has denied charges it 
blocked visas for nicaraguan officials planning to attend next 
weeks opening of the un general assembly but nicaraguan 
president danield ortega has cancelled his trip 
we have not denied the nicaraguans visas department 
spokesman charles redman said thursday were processing their 
visas the nicaraguans applied late 
redman said us officials normally require 15 working days for 
processing nicaraguan visa applications but that the sandinista 
officials made the request on sept 13 for a sept 24 arrival in 
new york the assembly gets under way on sept 26 
of 60 visas requested 30 have been expedited including those 
of ortega and his family and senior foreign ministry officials 
redman said 
other officials said the state department is planning to approve 
the remaining visa requests on oct 4 15 working days after the 
applications were submitted by that date ortega had planned to be 
back in nicaragua 
this arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a denial of 
nicaraguan rights nicaraguan deputy foreign minister victor hugo 
tinoco said in managua as he announced that ortega was canceling 
his trip that was to have included a speech to the general assembly 
rudi boone a state department spokesman said late thursday he 
had no comment on ortegas decision 
asked whether the department could expedite the visas in time 
for ortega and his entourage to attend the general assembly boone 
said i could not say 
nicaraguas ambassador to the united nations alejandro serrano 
caldera accused the state department wednesday night of blocking 
the visa requests 
on thursday leonor huper acting head of the nicaraguan embassy 
in washington reiterated the charge and she denied redmans 
assertion that ortegas family members had received visas 
she also disputed redmans statement that the visa applications 
were not filed in time 
we requested the visas with enough time she said 
marcos wheelock minister counselor of nicaraguas organization 
of american states delegation said ortega had planned to fly from 
new york to washington on sept 29 to address the oas permanent 
council 
wheelock said oas rules require that the united states as host 
country permit each member state to staff its delegation as it 
sees fit 
thus the us decision to delay approval of some visa requests 
until after ortegas scheduled oas speech interferes severely 
with nicaraguas rights as an oas member wheelock said he added 
that nicaragua has lodged a protest with oas secretary general joao 
baena soares

cream and apple pie she goes back to jamestown va in 1611 and 
that was 13 years before the pilgrims had cows to milk up in 
plymouth colony 
farmers are milking fewer cows today than they did a few years 
ago but each cow is producing lots more milk and there are all 
sorts of different products these days from commercially prepared 
eggnog to fruitflavored yogurt 
in fact according to the milk industry foundation the average 
cow of 150 years ago produced an estimated 1500 quarts of milk per 
year todays bossy yields 6412 quarts annually

green bows will sprout from the lapels 
of businessmen schoolchildren and tourists next week as floridas 
space coast pins its hopes for continued economic boom times on the 
launch of discovery 
every day there is a little more excitement and a little bit 
more tension you can feel it said dr bruce rafert acting 
executive director of the space research institute at florida 
institute of technology space is our business and people here 
understand the extreme significance of what success and failure 
means 
the challenger explosion 32 months ago was a blow to the space 
coast where launching rockets has been both a business and a 
personal adventure for almost three decades it meant the loss of 
thousands of jobs for engineers technicians and others at 
aerospace companies and with the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
to the surprise of many however the local economy weathered 
the disaster quite well 
weve done a lot better than people thought we would do 
says joe catrambone executive director of the titusville chamber 
of commerce on an overall basis the business climate was up 
over the past two years maybe not as much as we would have wanted 
but it was still growth 
his words are echoed by economic specialists in other parts of 
brevard county 
there were cuts in space center jobs at first and overtime 
was curtailed significantly but it didnt take too long before 
they nasa and shuttle contractors were back up to normal said 
hank taylor assistant director of the brevard economic development 
council based in cocoa the numbers of workers are greater 
today than at the time of the accident 
tourism too has increased at a steady pace and commercial 
activity retail stores hotels restaurants has been healthy 
for much of the past two years after suffering a sharp dip in the 
first months following challenger 
the spaceport usa visitors center has recorded record attendance 
in each of the past 20 months and is now floridas fourth 
mostpopular tourist attraction following disney world sea world 
and busch gardens attendance for 1988 is expected to reach 27 
million visitors 
enthusiasm for the launch scheduled for thursday has been 
heightened by a greenforshuttle campaign spearheaded by 
brevard countys three chambers of commerce in titusville cocoa 
beach and melbourne 
spokesmen for those groups say they expect more than half a 
million visitors for launch about half of those in titusville 
which is directly across the indian river from the launch pad 
the chamber campaigns include the sale of thousands of green 
lapel bows that residents and visitors will begin wearing five days 
before launch businessmen have ordered them by the hundreds at 40 
cents apiece and the county school board has purchased 56000 of 
them for grade schoolchildren 
the green bows are symbols that visibly demonstrate our 
interest enthusiasm and support for the space program said 
julie jones tourist director for the local chamber 
the 7000 employees of lockheed space operations co which 
processes the shuttle for launch will get personal letters and 
commemorative medallions with the discovery mission insignia from 
their boss lockheed president doug sargent 
lockheed which laid off close to 2000 workers in the months 
after the challenger accident is back at full strength and 
extremely excited about the program resumption said spokesman 
john williams 
each time weve hit a milestone in the processing flow 
enthusiasm has built now our people are feeling were almost 
there williams said discovery is a good bird everybodys 
confident 
besides the immediate impact of the 26th shuttle mission space 
coast people are counting on a new national commitment for 
commercial launches and space activity 
since the shuttle has now been designated primarily for military 
and governmental cargo sharp increases are expected in the use of 
medium and heavy unmanned rockets for commercial satellites and 
privateindustry research in space 
aerospace executives are working with nasa gov bob martinez 
and other state and local officials on a spaceport florida 
concept providing a privatesector highway to space the policy 
encourages other commercial initiatives in the space program 
there is a huge pentup demand for research and development in 
space because of the moratorium on launching said rafert

michael dukakis set aside today to cram for his 
debate showdown with george bush after responding to the republican 
nominees visit to boston with a pointed attack labeling him 
awol in the nations war on crime and drugs 
the democratic presidential nominee was spending the entire day 
with his staff and advisers preparing for sundays debate his only 
scheduled public appearance was an early morning game of catch with 
boston red sox center fielder ellis burks outside dukakis home 
in town to help dukakis prepare is new jersey sen bill bradley 
and the democratic nominee planned to take part in a mock debate 
after morning briefings 
dukakis spent part of thursday preparing for the debate but he 
was forced to alter his schedule to defend his record on crime from 
attacks by bush who popped into boston to pick up a police union 
endorsement 
his administration has waged not a war on crime but a war 
against crime control programs dukakis told a rowdy afternoon 
rally outside his statehouse office 
were here to give george bush what joe friday used to ask 
for the facts maam just the facts dukakis told the crowd of 
law enforcement officials and supporters before criticizing bush 
and the reagan administration for cutting aid to local police and 
for allowing drug imports into the united states to soar 
the law enforcement officials representing 100000 officers in 
eight states were quickly summoned to massachusetts in a dukakis 
effort to blunt the impact of the bush endorsement by leaders of 
the 1500member boston police union 
one of them representing the largest police organization in 
bushs adopted home state of texas prepared the crowd for dukakis 
with a fiery attack on bush 
im the only damn texan in ton today representing police 
officers said ron delord of the combined law enforcement 
associations of texas which represents 8000 officers across 
texas delord said bush failed in his assignment to curb drug 
trafficking across the texas border 
new york gov mario cuomo in town to help with debate 
preparation also pitched in at the dukakis counterattack 
im tired of this pandering cuomo said of the bush 
campaign im tired of the simplistics and the distortions by 
people like the vice president 
for his part dukakis delivered an emotional rhetorical flogging 
of the vice president that delighted his partisan audience and 
seemed to invigorate dukakis 
were here today to investigate a felony assault and battery 
on the truth dukakis said what george bush is doing to the 
truth in this campaign is a crime 
for weeks dukakis aides have been fuming at what they see as 
bushs misrepresentation of dukakis record on crime and the 
environment and of the massachusetts economy 
dukakis stepped into the fray thursday saying bush came to 
boston two weeks ago to impersonate an environmentalist and was 
back again to impersonate a law enforcement officer the 
massachusetts governor also said bush has mugged the truth 
every time he has spoken about the states economy 
dukakis noted that crime in massachusetts has dropped 137 
percent in the past five years while the federal rate has risen 
and he touted masschusetts ranking as the industrial state with 
the lowest homicide rate 
dukakis also addressed an issue at the heart of bushs effort to 
portray the democrat as soft on crime a massachusetts furlough 
program that until amended earlier this year allowed passes to 
firstdegree murderers 
dukakis said the federal government last year granted furloughs 
to nearly 16000 inmates including hundreds and hundreds of drug 
pushers and drug traffickers 
one reason leaders of the police union said they endorsed bush 
was because dukakis did not attend the funerals of three boston 
officers recently killed in the line of duty dukakis in an 
apparent challenge to the argument said the suspect in one of the 
slayings had been paroled from a federal prison after serving less 
than half of his 15year term for bank robbery

leading pollsters say the choice of dan quayle 
as a running mate has done more harm than good for republican 
george bush but theyre far from predicting it will cost bush the 
presidential election 
those poll takers who point to the preference among voters for 
sen lloyd bentsen as a possible successor to the presidency point 
out that the vice presidential running mate doesnt normally decide 
the outcome of an election they also point to some negative 
feelings toward democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
i believe quayle could be bushs achilles heel cbs news 
pollster warren mitofsky said thursday at a panel discussion 
sponsored by the national council on public polls 
mitofsky said his surveys show that on the question of who is 
preferred for vice president bentsen or quayle the democrat is 
preferred by a twotoone margin 
mitofsky said that among the group of voters paying the most 
attention to the campaign dukakis held a slight lead but he said 
when this group was asked who they would favor if no running mates 
were involved bush led 
theyll vote for bush over dukakis if thats all they have to 
do but if you put quayle in the mix they go the other way he 
said its only a small move but its there 
gordon black who polls for cnn and usa today said quayle has a 
2to3 percentage point overall negative effect for bush in his 
polls 
his survey shows 23 percent saying they are less likely to vote 
for bush because of quayle while 6 percent said they were more 
likely to vote for bush because of his running mate 
but black said that appeared to be offset by an unrelated 
finding that the liberal tag bush has pinned to dukakis has 
caused 30 percent of respondents to say they are less likely to 
vote for the democrat nine percent said liberalism made them more 
likely to support dukakis 
richard wirthlin who is conducting surveys for the white house 
and the republican national committee did not not release his poll 
findings on the indiana senator but he said in an interview later 
that they were in line with mitofskys 
on the net it has been more negative than positive said 
wirthlin 
the question is to what extent do people vote for the ticket 
because of the vice president he said in the past that has 
not been a big issue 
personally i think two things one before this campaign is 
over quayle is going to look better than he does right now two 99 
percent of americans are going to vote for either bush or dukakis 
and not for quayle or bentsen 
quayles negatives appeared most recently in an nbc newswall 
street journal poll released thursday more voters viewed him 
unfavorably than favorably 37 percent to 33 percent a reversal 
from his 4022 favorable rating last month half the voters said 
quayle was a bad choice 
a gallup poll for the times mirror corp also referred to quayle 
as the achilles heel of the republicans while quayle did not 
appear to be an issue on which votes were swinging directly poll 
analyst norman ornstein said quayle would be more of an issue 
that the overall numbers suggest because of questions over bushs 
judgment 
peter hart a frequent pollster for democratic candidates said 
negative reaction to quayle has increased over the past month 
apparently as doubts about his qualifications were considered more 
fully by americans 
bush maintains a small lead over dukakis in most recent national 
polls hart said that should dukakis win however quayle would be 
cited as the major reason 
you look a month later and its much worse for dan quayle 
said hart who is polling for the chicago tribune the perception 
over the last month has gone steadily more negative and the 
perception persists that hes just really not ready to be either 
vice president or president 
wirthlin said quayle has a chance to ease negative perceptions 
about him in his debate with bentsen on oct 5 and he predicted 
quayle will look better by election day

republican presidential nominee george bush lost 
support among democrats who voted for president reagan in 1984 but 
more voters are viewing democrat michael dukakis as too liberal a 
new poll says 
the nbc newswall street journal poll thursday showed bush 
leading dukakis 4541 
bushs running mate sen dan quayle of indiana also lost 
ground more voters viewed him unfavorably than favorably 37 
percent to 33 percent a reversal from his 40 percent to 22 percent 
favorable rating last month half the voters said quayle was a bad 
choice 
twentyfive percent of the reagan democrats in the poll 
supported bush down from 35 percent a month ago the democrats are 
making a special effort especially in the campaigning by sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas to win back those more conservative 
democrats 
the survey of 2360 likely voters in the poll had a margin of 
error of two points meaning that bush and dukakis were essentially 
tied other recent polls have had similar results 
a poll late last month after the republican national convention 
put bush ahead by 47 percent to 40 percent among likely voters 
the newest poll done sept 16 through monday found bush 
continuing to do better with men than with women and losing ground 
with women since last month 
although he lost ground with reagan democrats bush gained with 
his criticism of dukakis as liberal a third of the voters polled 
said dukakis was too liberal to be a good president up from 27 
percent last month the 54 percent who disagreed was down from 64 
percent 
bush was rated as a good vice president by 54 percent and 
dukakis as a good governor by 52 percent but the voters by 6225 
percent said being vice president was better training for the 
presidency than being a governor 
bush led substantially among men 5038 but the support of 
women flipped from 4440 with bush ahead last month to dukakis 
ahead by the same margin now 
the overall result of 45 percent to 41 percent produced a margin 
similar to those in an atlanta constitution poll done last week 
which put the race at 4340 and a washington postabc news poll 
which put it at 5046

a gunman who never said a word killed two 
people thursday in an auto parts store then fatally wounded a 
police officer and a custodian at a nearby school before police 
shot the man dead authorities said 
a city garbage man also was wounded as was a second police 
officer at the montefiore school on the citys west side and it 
was the injured officer who gunned down the man said chicago 
police superintendent leroy martin 
the dead police officer was irma ruiz 40 a mother of four who 
had been on the force 12 years martin said 
the gunman described by a friend as full of anger since his 
combat service in vietnam had a history of battery complaints and 
drug use martin said im assuming he may have had some type of 
grievance but i dont know 
all the witnesses state that this individual never said a 
word in the store before opening fire martin added 
at an afternoon news conference martin gave the following 
account 
the gunman clemie henderson 40 walked into the comet auto 
parts store about 10 am and shot and killed two clerks behind the 
counter john van dyke 41 and robert quinn 26 henderson missed 
a third clerk who pretended to be hit and fell to the ground 
quinn died with a pencil in one hand and a telephone in another 
henderson then walked out a side entrance and encountered city 
garbage man laplose chestnut jr 34 fired his 38caliber 
handgun at chestnut and shot him in the hand chestnut was in fair 
condition at cook county hospital said spokeswoman wanda robertson 
henderson headed for montefiore a school serving about 135 
troubled boys where he shot and killed custodian arthur baker 33 
who was outside the building 
at the door he met mrs ruiz and officer greg jaglowski 38 who 
had been called to the school to deal with an unruly youth ms 
ruiz was felled with a bullet to the chest and jaglowski was shot 
in the legs 
the offender retreated to a room emptied out the empty shells 
from his revolver and reloaded with six fresh rounds martin said 
when henderson came back into the hall he exchanged fire with 
jaglowski who shot him twice in the chest police found 22 more 
rounds of ammunition on henderson 
martin said of jaglowski hes a genuine hero 
the rev c ferguson who lives near the school said he saw the 
gunman after he left the store and headed toward the school he 
said get out of the way dont nobody move ferguson said 
students at the school were in classes said principal bernard 
karlin 
crisis intervention workers were at the school to help students 
deal with any emotional problems that may arise said chicago 
schools superintendent manford byrd who went to the scene soon 
after the shootings 
martin said henderson lived in the neighborhood and police found 
literature in his apartment indicating he worked as a model and 
hairdresser 
investigators also found a picture of him dressed in military 
fatigues and holding an m1 rifle a friend of hendersons david 
finke said he served as an army combat infantryman in vietnam 
during the late 1960s and early 1970s 
i think it is fair to say he carried his disturbance from the 
vietnam era into the present said finke chairman of the midwest 
committee for military counseling an agency that counsels 
veterans current members of the armed forces and those considering 
enlisting 
i think clem had a great deal of anger i always sensed he was 
working very hard to be under control finke said something in 
these last few weeks just lost control of that 
finke said henderson had three children by a first marriage and 
had remarried but separated from his second wife in july he said 
henderson also had worked as a teacher for a chain of beauty 
colleges and as a model until he quit about two years ago 
complaining of being burned out 
had my two officers not been in the school im afraid we 
would have had another incident such as what occurred in the north 
suburbs martin said 
he was referring to the may 20 shooting rampage of lori dann in 
winnetka she shot an 8yearold student and six others before 
turning her gun on herself 
jaglowski was in serious but stable condition at mount sinai 
hospital with gunshot wounds of the right thigh and lower left 
leg said spokeswoman diann smith

studying tread marks as carefully as other 
forensic experts scrutinize fingerprints peter mcdonald uses his 
experience as a former firestone tire designer to uncover 
crimesolving clues 
i think it requires a trained eye said mcdonald 58 who 
has taught tire print identification at police academies in about 
15 states and a few canadian provinces he spoke at an fbi academy 
symposium in 1984 
mcdonald testified this week at a preliminary court hearing in 
the kunz family slayings a case that investigators labored on for 
more than a year before charging a man with being a party to the 
murders 
four family members were found shot to death july 5 1987 a 
fifth member was missing until her remains were found nearly nine 
months later 
mcdonald testified that a gap left by a stone in a tire cut 
positively identified a tire on the charged mans car as having 
made a track found at the murder scene 
no other tire in the world could have made that impression 
he told the court 
mcdonald who designed tires for 28 years at firestone tire and 
rubber co began identifying tire prints about 10 years ago when 
he was contacted by police in california he later started a 
hudson ohio consulting firm 
being a manager of tire design i was involved in checking 
other peoples work he said thursday that training plus the 
fact that im an artist and studied architecture i feel gives me a 
leg up on people who come to this from a strictly scientific 
background 
at the fbi laboratory in washington supervisory special agent 
william j bodziak said he has articles dating back to the 1930s 
that refer to tire identification 
but identifying tire prints is less common than fingerprints or 
shoe prints and theres no real course to teach it bodziak 
said the six fbi examiners who do tire identification work at the 
lab have learned their trade mainly from other examiners and 
experience he said 
the michigan state police crime laboratory has operated a 
computer program to help identify tire tracks for at least eight 
years in east lansing but analysts there receive mostly 
onthejob training and training by mr mcdonald said frank 
schehr assistant director 
peter mcdonald is quite an expert in that area he said 
mcdonald said he has testified in four homicide cases one rape 
case and a civil case involving a young girl who was hit by a 
vehicle 
on wednesday he was in marathon county circuit court in a 
preliminary hearing for chris jacobs iii a 22yearold 
northcentral wisconsin man charged with five counts of being a 
party to the firstdegree murders of the kunz family members 
mcdonald spent most of the day on the stand explaining his 
methods 
he said he begins with scale photographs of the tracks found at 
the crime scene and inked impressions of any suspect tires 
he identifies tread patterns by studying the length of pitches 
or zigzag patterns around the tire the manufacturer varies these 
lengths to help reduce the amount of noise the tires make he said 
he then compares 13 items in the prints including the shapes of 
the tire tread elements the number of raised ribs and size of 
pitch lengths to determine the brand and design of tire 
mcdonald said he looks for variations in the tire tracks and 
inked impressions to see if they share characteristics of the same 
tire manufacturing mold 
if the tracks and impressions share the same brand and mold 
characteristics mcdonald uses the manufacturers tire plans to 
study the general accidental characteristics or signs of wear 
but to make a positive identification mcdonald said he needs to 
find something like a gap caused by a stone or indications of a 
torn piece of rubber

vice president george bush is pledging to 
modernize existing conventional weapons in europe through a program 
under consideration at the pentagon for the past two years 
the republican presidential nominee in a speech thursday to a 
gop fundraiser in houston said he would seek to maximize the 
value of our military investments through the more efficient use 
of existing weapons systems and those in the pipeline now 
bush was taking a break from debate preparations today to hold a 
private meeting with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff said the session with 
shevardnadze will give the vice president a chance to look ahead 
a little bit 
this is an area where i think americans dont want to change 
course fuller told reporters aboard air force two i think it 
should be seen as an opportunity for george bush to build on the 
record of the reagan administration 
on thursday bush told a gop fundraiser that it was not 
necessary to match the soviets bullet for bullet and tank for 
tank 
the vice president shared the stage at the 1000 a person 
gathering with president reagan who told the audience that 
democrats use our words and borrow our tunes but the song is way 
out of key the banquet generated about 31 million said bush 
spokeswoman sheila tate 
in his speech bush did not elaborate on the defense plan but 
aides said that the vice presidents competitive strategies 
initiative to be outlined in greater detail over the next few 
days by bush and defense secretary frank carlucci would involve a 
shifting of strategies to deal more effectively with the defense of 
europe 
the move could mean a reduction of us troops overseas in the 
future as other hightechnology weapons systems are pressed into 
service the aides said 
modernization of conventional forces has been a major proposal 
of democratic nominee michael dukakis the program also has been 
under review at the defense department bush aides said 
bush was to continuing preparing today for sundays nationally 
televised debate with dukakis and had no events scheduled after the 
morning meeting with the soviet foreign minister 
with just days to go to the showdown bush forces sought to 
throw dukakis off guard with a blitz into his backyard thursday to 
collect an endorsement from the boston police patrolmens 
association 
bush called the endorsement a great boost even as dukakis 
supporters staged counterrallies outside and on the steps of the 
massachusetts statehouse 
who was it who said the police arent there when you need 
them theyre wrong bush said at the event which aides said 
would be highlighted in a forthcoming bush campaign commercial 
later in houston bush told the gop banquet the differences 
between me and the governor of massachusetts couldnt be more 
clear i am the one with the texas values 
asked if bushs remarks about conventional forces could suggest 
a movement toward reducing the number of us troops in europe 
bush spokeswoman alixe glen said it could it could mean there 
would be less emphasis on that 
however she said that the initiative did not automatically mean 
that bush favored such a reduction 
dennis ross bushs foreign policy adviser said that the 
proposal was not intended to signal support for a troop reduction 
and is simply a new management process for spending our money 
smarter in new weapons systems of the future

a collection of more than 10000 jokes 
included so many bigoted sexist stories that the college students 
who compiled them were shocked a professor says 
some students were so disturbed they had to come and talk to 
me about the nature of the jokes professor c david mortensen 
said some were shocked at the brutality implicit in much of the 
humor 
the spring semester assignment for the university of 
wisconsinmadison students found that about 30 percent of the 
10000 jokes gathered were ethnically offensive and another 30 
percent were sexually offensive mortensen said recently 
about 60 students participated in the independent study he said 
the study showed nearly a third of the jokes gathered in the 
madison area were ethnic or racial primarily demeaning jewish 
polish or black people 
middleclass white people the main source of the jokes rarely 
tell jokes about themselves mortensen said 
i think theres a connection between who we joke about and who 
were afraid of mortensen added theres a lot of fear anger 
aggressivity that is released towards people who make up less than 
10 percent of the population in madison 
nearly onethird of the jokes were sexually offensive relating 
to differences in gender or lifestyle he said 
this material is extremely aggressive its lurid and it 
suggests that we not only find jokes about sexuality funny we 
particularly find funny the sexual styles of people whose values 
are incompatible with our own mortensen said 
other jokes were about babies particularly dead babies he 
said or about disabled people animals religion and this being 
an election year politicians 
gary hart whose relationship with model donna rice cost him a 
bid at the white house was a prime target mortensen said 
mortensen expects to finish his project entitled the power of 
midwestern ethnic humor to hurt and heal by the end of the 
semester he said he regards humor as a form of aggression yet a 
powerful social lubricant 
jokes laughter ridicule and sarcasm allow us to have a cheap 
thrill a cheap triumph he said they allow us both to express 
the tension and hostility that we feel towards people that are not 
like us and at the same time they ease tensions

smalltown boys and girls kept in line by a 
beatup crew were lured into operating a 3millionaday drug 
ring that once accounted for half of detroits crack trade 
prosecutors and witnesses say 
opening arguments began thursday in the federal trial of 14 
members of the ring allegedly headed by four brothers billy joe 
chambers larry marlowe chambers otis bernard chambers and willie 
lee chambers 
each grew up in marianna ark and allegedly returned to that 
rural town from 1982 to 1987 to recruit teenagers for the detroit 
operation in what us attorney roy hayes called a tale of two 
cities 
the chambers brothers and 10 other people are charged with 
cocaine conspiracy firearms and tax evasion the trial before us 
district judge richard suhrheinrich is expected to last six to 
eight weeks 
crack and murder among youths has grown to a problem of 
staggering proportions in the nations sixthlargest city 
some 1000 crack houses are operating here and detroits 
juvenile homicide rate reached 41 per 100000 in 1986 the latest 
year for which figures are available that rate was more than three 
times the 1986 rate of 13 in the 10 largest us cities detroit 
also has had the nations highest per capita homicide rate for 
cities over 100000 population for most of the past 10 years 
according to fbi statistics 
the chambers brothers decided to recruit young people 14 to 
16yearold people who were not streetwise people who would 
not rip them off hayes said in opening arguments 
he said the organization had as many as 400 employees operated 
up to 300 crack houses which manufactured crack cocaines 
smokeable form and cleared hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
profits daily 
hayes first witness former organization member patricia 
middleton backed his descriptions of an expanding network of 
trusted lieutenants and child drug dealers kept in line by a 
noholdsbarred wrecking crew or beatup crew 
in march 22 people were indicted four have pleaded guilty 
four others remain fugitives 
authorities confiscated 41 cars including mercedesbenz 
cadillac and jeep models 250 weapons 500000 in cash and 
500000 in jewelry in serving 107 search warrants leading to 
indictments in the case 
defense attorneys said hayes sought to base his case on 
witnesses who were testifying in exchange for immunity 
that is the lowest form of testimony the government can 
present someone who is trying to save his skin said william e 
bufalino ii representing defendant kevin duplessis 
david harris representing defendant morris hampton told the 
jurors that by the trials end you will be reading a different 
book much ado about nothing 
but middleton 33 of detroit said she worked for about six 
months as a driver picking up cash from crack houses before she 
braved intimidation and went to police 
middleton wept as she described her decision to go to police 
after larry chambers held a gun to her head and said if she talked 
ill blow your brains out 
she backed hayes descriptions of a network of trusted 
lieutenants and child drug dealers kept in line by strict rules 
threats and violence 
larry chambers beat one gang member for selling soap in place of 
crack another member was beaten with a baseball bat and a third 
was pushed out of a window on the third floor of her apartment 
building she said 
middleton said she made money pickups for about six months 
earning 800 a week but worked under threats from larry chambers 
that the man she lived with would be hurt

south korean government for not sharing the olympics with communist 
north korea they also claimed the government would use the games 
to cement authoritarian rule 
speakers said the games were being used by the seoul government 
to perpetuate the division of the korean peninsula the games they 
said should be shared to help reunite the two koreas 
protesters also demanded the release of a student leader 
arrested by police thusday for organzing antigovernment protests 
in recent months 
north korea is boycotting the olympics because its demand to be

shared 
the korean peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii and 
separate republics were founded in the north and south in 1948

president daniel ortega canceled plans 
to speak before the united nations next week because of charges the 
united states illegally put off issuing visas to members of his 
delegation 
us officials said the problem arose because the nicaraguans 
submitted their request late 
speaking thursday night when he announced cancellation of 
ortegas trip deputy foreign minister victor tinoco said at a news 
conference this arbitrary and illegal attitude constitutes a 
denial of nicaraguas rights 
alejandro bendana secretarygeneral of the foreign ministry 
said in a telephone interview that the reagan administration 
deliberately was setting up obstacles to stop the sandinista 
government from speaking at the united nations and the organization 
of american states 
evidently the reagan administration is petrified that we may 
sound reasonable he said 
the cancellation of the trip came two days after house speaker 
jim wright revealed a covert cia operation to destabilize the 
leftist government 
it also comes two months after nicaragua expelled us 
ambassador richard melton and seven other diplomats accusing them 
of destabilizing the country the united states retaliated by 
expelling eight nicaraguan diplomats from washington 
the us embassy notified the nicaraguan foreign ministry on 
thursday that only half of the 60 visa requests for visits to the 
united nations and the organization of american states in 
washington had been processed 
it said the other visas for cabinet ministers highlevel 
foreign ministry officials and journalists would not be ready by 
saturday when president ortega and his delegation planned to leave 
for the united states ortega planned to speak before the un 
general assembly wednesday in new york and thursday before the 
organization of american states in washington 
we have not denied the nicaraguans visas state department 
spokesman charles redman said thursday were processing their 
visas the nicaraguans applied late 
redman said us officials normally require 15 working days for 
processing nicaraguan visa applications but that the sandinista 
officials made the request on sept 13 for a sept 24 arrival in 
new york 
but a highlevel nicaraguan foreign ministry official said the 
15 working days applied only to visas for official state visits 
between the two nations such as those given to diplomats 
american citizens who are not government employees do not need 
visas to enter nicaragua 
diplomatic relations between nicaragua and the united states 
have been strained for more than seven years the reagan 
administration has supported nicaraguan rebels since 1981 in their 
war to oust the sandinistas 
washington claims the nicaraguan government threatens us 
national security by being a beachhead for communism the 
sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolutionary war that deposed 
president anastasio somoza 
the united states saying the sandinistas backed marxist 
guerrillas fighting in el salvador cut off economic aid to 
nicaragua in 1981 and imposed a trade embargo in 1985 
on tuesday wright dtexas disclosed that the cia had 
instigated demonstrations aimed at provoking the sandinista 
government to take repressive actions 
the sandinistas in early july charged that the us embassy was 
behind a plot to create internal disturbances on july 11 the 
nicaraguan government expelled melton and the seven diplomats 
accusing them of backing an antigovernment demonstration a day 
earlier 
washington dismissed the sandinista claims and expelled 
nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnerman and seven of his colleagues 
wrights statements about the cia attempting to foment internal 
problems appeared to confirm earlier sandinista claims 
managua has yet to make an official statement about wrights 
revelations my impression is that its no secret the central 
intelligence agency for the past eight years has been trying to 
overthrow the government bendana said the obvious can hardly 
strike us as news

slight dip in bushs support since the week after the republican 
national convention 
the nbc newswall street journal survey of 2630 likely voters 
found bush leading 4541 percent compared with last months poll 
showing bush ahead 4740 percent

enforcement said bush who was surrounded by about 50 patrolmen 
all elected representatives of the police union 
the leadership of the largest union in new england in 
explaining the bush endorsement cited dukakis revolving door 
policy for criminals and his failure to attend the funerals of 
three officers killed in the line of duty

conventional forces in europe 
reagan told the 31 million fundraiser that the democrats 
use our words and borrow our tune but the song is way out of

sacrilege and tragedy it was the first time in the churchs 
109year history that the rite to cleanse and purify a profaned 
sacred place was performed 
oconnor said the attacker jorge delgado 32 a cuban 
immigrant was one of the many homeless people who seek refuge in 
the church to avoid the elements or often just to find a place to 
sleep 
you can find them inside the church any time of the day he 
said adding the archdiocese of new york would not change its 
opendoor policy as a result of the incident i would hate to see 
us now get defensive

the internal revenue service says ptl 
cant pay its bills and has asked a bankruptcy judge to stop the 
ministrys religious broadcasting 
in motions filed in us bankruptcy court the irs asked judge 
reynolds to act tuesday to terminate a lease between ptl and its 
7weekold spinoff heritage ministries 
the irs objected to the lease when reynolds approved it in july 
if reynolds agrees with the irs the ministrys 19yearold talk 
show first known as the ptl club later as the jim and 
tammy show and now as heritage today could go off the air 
within a week 
the ptl satellite network is carried by about 900 cable systems 
and the ministry has estimated its worth at 15 million 
ptl filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankrupcty code in june 1987 three months after ptl founder jim 
bakker left following a sexandmoney scandal 
all of ptls property must be sold to pay creditors one of the 
largest creditors is the irs with a 55 million claim 
reynolds suggested last spring that ptl spin off its religious 
functions into a separate ministry that would own no property and 
owe none of ptls debts the idea was to give the ministry a chance 
to continue after the liquidation of ptl itself 
but heritage ministries is in trouble even if reynolds rejects 
the irs motion officials say 
the new ministrys president don edwards said this week that 
contributions have virtually ceased and that heritage cant afford 
to continue another month unless reynolds grants permission to use 
money from the sale of ptl real estate 
heritage ministries was unable to make its first months rent 
payment of 117000 for the use of ptls broadcasting and church 
facilities the irs said it also said the ministry owes ptl 
125000 for air time on the ptl satellite network 
contributions to heritage ministries in august were only 
703000 as recently as march ptl was taking in that much every 
week 
last saturday heritage ministries suspended the operations of 
its home for unwed mothers and dormitories for homeless 
drugaddicted and troubled men 
reynolds has instructed a federal bankruptcy trustee to 
recommend a buyer for ptl by tuesday reynolds said he has offers 
from two or three unidentified groups a bid by bakker fell apart 
earlier this month when he couldnt secure financing 
in addition to the ministry fort millbased ptl owns a 
christian theme park a hotel and land

a top aide to vice president george bush says 
the republican presidential nominee complained to a highlevel 
panamanian official about drugmoney laundering during a visit five 
years ago but did not discuss it with gen manuel antonio noriega 
bushs chief of staff craig fuller on two occasions thursday 
discussed the 1983 bushnoriega meeting with reporters after a 
british television documentary quoted a former senior noriega aide 
as saying bush had complained to the general about money laundering 
the assertion by col roberto diaz herrera contradicts bushs 
contention that the reagan administration took action against 
noriega as soon as it learned of alleged drug activity by panamas 
military leader 
noriega was indicted in federal court on drug charges in 
february and us sanctions began against panama earlier this year 
this story is something weve discussed before its not 
something weve attempted to hide fuller said later fuller 
said again it is not news and said the bush campaign wanted to 
clear up any lingering questions before sundays debate with 
democrat michael dukakis 
the vice presidents staff confirmed bush met with panamas 
thenpresident ricardo de la espriella and other officials 
including noriega for 45 minutes during a refueling stopover in 
panama on dec 11 1983 at the panama city airport 
fuller said a review of stillclassified briefing papers on the 
meeting inidcated that noriega did not speak during the session on 
drugmoney laundering or on anything else of substance but he 
added the notion that vice president bush would sit down with the 
president of panama and discuss drugmoney laundering should be a 
plus 
he said espriella assured bush at the meeting that his 
government would step up efforts to try to curtail this 
laundering 
fuller also denied an allegation that noriega had information 
on alleged training of nicaraguan contra soldiers in panama with 
which he planned to blackmail the vice president 
fuller said thats a foolhardy notion we dont believe hes 
blackmailing us 
diaz and jose i blandon a former senior intelligence officer 
in panama were quoted as saying noriega claims to have pictures 
and tape recordings that would link bush or his aides to secret 
training of nicaraguan rebels 
from october 1984 to october 1986 us law prohibited any us 
government aid to the contras in their fight to topple nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government the documentary did not say when the 
pictures were taken nor when the tape recordings were made 
we have learned that as early as 1983 george bush sat down 
with gen noriega to complain about the laundering of drug money in 
panama reporter julian manyon said on the thames television 
program which was screened for reporters wednesday 
manyon said the meeting raised important questions about 
bushs contention the administration acted as soon as it learned of 
allegations against noriega concerning the laundering of drug 
profits 
in an interview from venezuela diaz said he once saw noriega 
examining photographs which apparently showed contras being 
secretly trained in panama under an arrangement with lt col 
oliver north the white house aide dismissed over the irancontra 
affair in which profits from arms sales to iran were funneled to 
the contras 
blandon who has been a witness at a senate foreign relations 
committee hearing investigating noriega said he believed people 
inside the bush campaign are aware of the threat that noriega poses 
for them because the general has sent a message telling bush 
campaign officials he has the tape recordings the documentary was 
to be broadcast thursday night on britains commercial independent 
television network

leaders canceled another effort to elect 
a new president as lebanese awakened today to life under rival 
christian and moslem governments 
the sectarian strife threatened to reignite a 13year civil 
conflict that has taken more than 130000 lives 
todays scheduled session of parliament to elect a new chief of 
state was called off after president amin gemayel named an interim 
military government led by a christian the maronite catholic 
president announced the caretaker cabinet on thursday night five 
minutes before his sixyear term expired 
moslem leaders branded his move a virtual coup and vowed support 
for the existing moslemled cabinet 
the denunciations came thursday on a day of renewed religious 
violence three leaders of the main shiite moslem militia amal 
were assassinated earlier in the day and christians battled 
moslems for two hours along beiruts dividing green line one 
christian was reported killed 
though gemayels move was aimed at assuring a measure of unity 
in the crisis it initially appeared to have the opposite effect 
three moslem appointees immediately refused to serve in the 
cabinet now led by army commander gen michel aoun a maronite 
catholic 
this is a midget coup detat its not going to lift off the 
ground said druse moslem chieftain walid jumblatt in a statement 
broadcast by moslem radio stations in beirut 
jumblatt said the only legal government is that of acting 
prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
gemayels choice of aoun as prime minister came after leading 
moslem politicians refused to take part in an interim cabinet 
headed by a civilian maronite prime minister 
an unwritten national covenant calls for lebanons president to 
be a christian the prime minister a sunni moslem and the speaker 
of parliament a shiite moslem 
gemayel 45 named the transition government because parliament 
deeply divided along religious lines failed to elect a new 
president thursday christian deputies opposed presidential 
candidates backed by syria the nations main power broker and 
boycotted voting 
todays scheduled parliamentary session was the third failed 
attempt in five weeks to elect a new president 
the session is postponed until a date that will be announced 
later said a terse statement read by parliament secretary ihsan 
abu khalil 
the constitution bars gemayel from seeking another term 
aoun 53 had warned on wednesday that his 42000man army would 
take control of lebanon if no new president was elected before 
gemayels term expired 
but after the ceremony to hand over power aoun said my 
program is to arrange the speedy election of a new president 
aoun and his ministers who represent the six main religious 
sects of lebanon keep their top military posts 
refusals to serve in the caretaker cabinet came quickly from 
maj gen mahmoud abu dergham a druse col lutfi jaber a shiite 
and brig gen nabil qoraitem a sunni 
aoun asked if he would govern with only two christian members 
besides himself said i havent been formally informed of their 
the moslems rejection yet 
also named to aouns cabinet were col issam abu jamra greek 
orthodox and brig gen edgar maalouf greek catholic 
aoun will probably not be able to cross the green line into the 
moslem sector where the prime ministers office is located 
military sources said he was commuting between the presidential 
baabda palace and his headquarters in nearby yarze today 
in his televised farewell address gemayel saidtoday should 
have been a festival in which we rejoice over the election of a new 
president but the people of war were stronger than peace 
a police spokesman said amal leaders daoud daoud mahmoud fakih 
and hassan sbeiti died instantly when gunmen raked their car with 
machinegun fire and rocketpropelled grenades in south beiruts 
seaside ouzai district 
daoud and fakih led an april crackdown on hezbollah the 
iranianbacked party of god organization security sources said 
hezbollah vowed to kill them but no group immediately claimed 
responsibility 
two of the three candidates running for president former 
president suleiman franjieh 78 and parliament deputy mikhail 
daher 58 were chosen by syria which has about 40000 troops in 
lebanon 
the third veteran politician raymond edde 75 opposes all 
foreign meddling in lebanon he leads in public opinion polls

the state department is optimistic that 
malaysia and singapore will uphold an underlying commitment to 
fundamental democratic values despite recent controversial 
arrests in the two asian countries says a senior department 
official 
the official david f lambertson deputy assistant secretary of 
state for east asian and pacific affairs also says it would be 
premature to judge whether the independence of malaysias judiciary 
has been eroded by the recent removal of the supreme court 
president and the suspension of five justices in a dispute with the 
prime minister and parliament 
lambertson told a congressional panel thursday that american 
diplomats have voiced concern about such disquieting 
developments as the malaysian supreme court controversy and long 
detentions without trial under the two countries internal security 
laws 
but we are optimistic that an underlying commitment to 
fundamental democratic values will continue in both he added 
lambertsons testimony drew sharp questioning and criticism from 
some members of the house human rights subcommittee 
rep ted weiss dny said he will press for approval of a 
resolution urging singapore to release all those detained without 
trial for peaceful dissent and declaring that the us embassy in 
singapore should continue normal diplomatic contacts with citizens 
who monitor human rights or are in opposition to prime minister lee 
kuan yews government 
weiss cited singapores expulsion last may of e mason 
hendrickson an american diplomat who met with antigovernment 
lawyers as another area of concern the united states retaliated 
with the expulsion of a singapore diplomat from washington 
weiss also demanded that lambertson acknowledge that eight 
singapore dissidents recanted under duress a statement alleging 
physical abuse of detainees that they had issued after being 
arrested in 1987 and accused of a communist conspiracy the 
dissidents were released but lambertson reported that they changed 
the statement while under rearrest this year 
i dont think it behooves me to speculate on individual 
motives of why people say one thing on one occasion and another 
thing on another occasion lambertson told weiss 
describing lambertsons testimony as so bland that it could be 
a recipe for some kind of soup weiss questioned whether american 
diplomats were adequately conveying to malaysia and singapore the 
passionate commitment of the us to human rights 
lambertson replied that the level of passion depends on the 
individual but he could assure the subcommittee that human 
rights abuses are carefully investigated and that there is no 
doubt on the part of the singapore or malaysian governments as to 
our point of view 
rep gerald solomon rny said malaysia and singapore are 
very very important countries to the united states we place a 
high value on our relationship with them therefore are concerned 
how these governments treat their own people 
it is always difficult to criticize a friend he added and 
we are hopeful for some constructive suggestions on how best 
to go about conveying the concerns of congress and the 
administration

health care executives in several states 
and a promoter have been charged with offering kickbacks in return 
for lucrative employeebenefit contracts with businesses and labor 
unions 
workers around the country are adding another dollar or two 
to their health premiums because of secret kickbacks said richard 
held chief of the fbi office here 
the indictments against 10 people and one marylandbased health 
benefit company which include charges of racketeering 
embezzlement and falsifying records were unsealed thursday in san 
francisco atlanta baltimore chicago and san diego 
federal agents working undercover handled thousands of dollars 
in kickbacks for securing health benefit contracts for companies 
and labor unions during a threeyear investigation justice 
department officials said 
the kickbacks collected by brokers and health plan 
representatives were in addition to commissions that legitimate 
brokers charge for arranging contracts the officials said 
one of the indictments says an fbi agent was promised 7500 a 
month a rate of 75 cents for each employee at national 
semiconductor inc of santa clara calif by brokers for securing 
a health benefit contract the money which was never paid 
apparently would have been charged to the employer 
among those indicted were united healthcare inc of baltimore 
and one of its executives and the former benefit plan managers for 
two chicagobased labor unions 
but the central figure in the case is angelo commito 43 of 
fairfax calif described as a middleman in the business of lining 
up health benefit contracts for companies and unions authorities 
said he was arrested thursday in palm springs and released on 1 
million bail 
in the atlanta indictments commito and five other people are 
accused of conspiracy mail fraud wire fraud and money laundering 
in a plan to defraud the munford corp a retailing concern and 
its employee welfare plan in the selection of a second prepaid 
optical program and an alcohol and drug abuse counseling program 
the fraud allegedly involved using commitos companies to pay 
kickbacks to a government agent who posed as munfords 
representative for the purchase of the programs 
commito and another man also were accused of devising a scheme 
to defraud the national semiconductor corp of santa clara calif 
of money the two allegedly agreed would be used to pay kickbacks to 
a government undercover agent who posed as the company 
representative the kickbacks were to persuade the firm to buy an 
alcohol and drug rehabilitation program 
us attorney joseph russoniello of san francisco called commito 
a known associate of traditional organized crime individuals 
members of the aiuppa family of chicago 
the charges against him include violating the racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act in schemes against four 
benefit plans the maximum sentence is 20 years in prison and a 
250000 fine 
at a news conference russoniello said certain types of health 
benefits newly required by a number of states such as drug and 
alcohol rehabilitation appeared to be particularly attractive 
targets for corruption in the soliciting of benefit contracts 
the amount of money that passes through this kind of program 
has made it ripe for the plucking the prosecutor said its 
difficult to know how widespread nationally the abuse is 
he said the justice department would seek to consolidate all the 
cases in san francisco 
bill slavin president of united healthcare declared the firm 
innocent of all charges commito made no immediate comment on 
the indictments 
united which provides prepaid optical dental and medical 
prescription services to more than a million families in 42 states 
is accused of taking part in the scheme to pay the government agent 
who was soliciting an optical contract for employees of munford

rescuers aboard helicopters searched 
for a missing british worker today and shipboard crews battled 
flames from explosions and fire on a north sea oil platform 
officials said 
all the other 66 people on the semisubmersible platform ocean 
odyssey escaped thursday from the explosions and fire rescue 
helicopters took them to this port city and one was reported to 
have suffered slight injuries 
the rig is about 110 miles from where occidental petroleums 
semisubmersible oil rig piper alpha was swept by explosions and 
fire on july 6 killing 167 people in the worlds worst oil rig 
disaster 
police identified the missing man in thursdays accident as 
25yearold timothy williams a radio operator rescuers resumed 
their search for him at dawn today 
support ships today fought more flames as gas continued to well 
up to the platform 
the platform is owned by the new orleansbased ocean drilling 
and exploration co and operated by the atlantic richfield co of 
los angeles 
william waver the owners vice president was quoted by the 
london newspaper the independent today as saying the two blasts and 
fire apparently followed a buildup of gas pressure 
mud pumped into exploratory drilling pipes usually stops any 
pocket of high pressure gas or oil from forcing its way to the 
surface socalled blowouts occur when the pressure is too great 
to be held back by the mud valves fitted to prevent blowouts 
sometimes fail 
james murphy one of the 66 crewmen who escaped told reporters 
in aberdeen that two explosions engulfed the platform in flames 
murphy 42 an engineer on the platform said crewmen had been 
worried about the gas pressure for the past six weeks

thomas gossett calls it art but city 
officials objected that the nutsandbolts sculpture displayed in 
front of his auto parts business was a bit too earthy 
the stainlesssteel sculpture is a sevenfoottall male bolt 
with arms and legs chasing a shorter partially stooped female 
nut with her arms in the air 
officials in this detroit suburb found in suggestive and 
offensive and forced gossett to remove it from in front of his 
creative metals inc business 
it doesnt fall within the citys sign ordinance said mayor 
ronald bonkowski our building department has received many calls 
and letters about this this object for want of a better word the 
city suggested he remove it from in front of his business and he 
did were happy about that 
ive seen it and it doesnt qualify as a sign is it art not 
to me 
gossett said he made the sculpture for a friend at least three 
years ago but took it back when the friend received complaints for 
displaying it 
the sculpture stayed in gossetts shop until a few weeks ago 
when he moved it out front to free some space his attempts to 
mollify complaints failed 
i tried putting clothes on them a skirt on the girl and a 
shirt and pants for the guy he said sunglasses for both of 
them the city said nice try but theyve got to go 
back inside his shop gossett plans to separate the figures and 
set them up playing volleyball or something equally inoffensive 
but he expresses a little disappointment with his critics 
in the art world take picasso i see something you dont 
see gossett said every art object is different people are 
looking at this thing as a dirty porno thing its not

nasa has determined that the space 
shuttle discoverys boosters do not contain the old model of a 
nozzle ring used inadvertently in the final test of the redesigned 
booster 
engineers rechecked inventory paperwork and reexamined xrays 
before concluding that the twin rockets scheduled to help lift 
discovery into space thursday contain the correct improved nozzle 
inlet rings nasa spokesman ed medal said thursday 
he said early xrays of morton thiokols boosters were enhanced 
by computer and confirmed that the boosters are in the right 
configuration 
even if the olddesign rings had been found it was unlikely it 
would have delayed the launch because the old rings performed well 
in previous shuttle flights and tests said medal the space 
agencys spokesman at the marshall space flight center in 
huntsville ala 
engineers discovered earlier this week during regular posttest 
examination that the nozzle inlet ring installed in the aug 18 
test booster contained the old design morton thiokol said the old 
ring performed satisfactorily 
the rings are inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of the 
126footlong shuttle booster they are not the orings in the 
booster segment joints that were blamed for the jan 28 1986 
explosion of the shuttle challenger 
the nozzle inlet ring has been only slightly modified since 
then while the segment joints have been extensively redesigned

officials are investigating why five 
buses swept away by hurricane gilbert made a detour from their 
planned route into a riverbed putting them in the path of the 
disaster in which at least 140 people died 
at least 5000 families remained in shelters throughout northern 
nuevo leon state after last weeks flash floods caused by hurricane 
gilbert destroyed homes in the normally dry santa catarina riverbed 
and near other flooded rivers the government said thursday 
in a controversy dubbed by the local press as the detour to 
death state police said they were looking for reasons that the 
five buses detoured from their planned route only to be swept into 
the raging waters saturday morning 
were trying to understand why they were detoured there and 
who was responsible said gilbert sanchez of the state police 
he said in a telephone interview that the buses that pass 
through monterrey to other parts of the country normally would have 
been on a road nearly a mile from the riverbed 
transit police from monterrey and neighboring san pedro 
apparently detoured the buses but sanchez said reports that they 
were detoured because of a gas leak had not been confirmed 
its under investigation he said were getting a lot of 
versions 
the state government said in a news release that hundreds of 
families living in the sierra madre occidental surrounding this 
state capital remained isolated because roads were cut by flooding 
hurricane gilbert slammed into the gulf of mexico coast last 
friday then tore inland until it met the 14000foot mountains 
surrounding this metropolitan area of nearly 3 million people 190 
miles inland 
the normally dry santa catarina river that divides monterrey 
became a torrent of destruction sweeping away homes utility 
towers and streets built in the riverbed 
although the squatter communities that have been growing for 
decades in the riverbed were evacuated hours before the flood many 
people lost everything they owned 
gilbert killed more than 200 people in mexico honduras haiti 
jamaica and the dominican republic

hundreds of wellwishers huddled under umbrellas 
today at the imperial palace to pray in the rain for ailing emperor 
hirohito and thousands more signed getwell registries around 
japan 
his condition remained stable but he needed two more blood 
transfusions after continued hemorrhaging palace officials said 
today the 87yearold emperor the longest reigning monarch alive 
vomited blood monday from intestinal hemorrhaging and he has been 
in bed ever since 
crown prince akihito who took over imperial duties temporarily 
on thursday today presided over a palace ceremony attended by 
prime minister noboru takeshita to mark the autumnal equinox a 
national holiday 
about 500 people with umbrellas and cameras lined up in front of 
the palace gates today and waited to take up calligraphy brushes 
and put their names in a registry wishing the emperor a speedy 
recovery some chanted buddhist prayers 
palace officials said 23000 people signed registries placed in 
12 locations around the country thursday today officials were 
setting up outdoor tents with more lists in front of other 
government offices 
one elderly visitor to the palace wore a uniform of the japanese 
imperial army from the era of the russojapanese war of 190405 
the man said it wasnt his but he could find no other to wear 
i felt i had to wear some kind of military uniform to come 
before the emperor he said 
under the constitution written during the postworld war ii 
occupation by us forces the emperor who has ruled since 1926 
is only a symbol of the state with no real power 
while highly popular with many japanese he is opposed by a 
minority that views him as a remnant of the militarism that 
dominated before and during world war ii 
kenji maeda an official of the imperial household agency that 
runs palace affairs told reporters thursday that hirohito ate two 
ice cubes that day and watched his favorite television serial 
in britain tabloid newspapers renewed their attacks on hirohito 
today after japan protested their negative coverage 
the newspapers have called hirohito evil and said he deserves to 
go to hell for his acts during world war ii 
we cannot forget that in the name of emperor hirohito the 
japanese army and navy launched a criminal attack on british 
possessions in the far east for no other reason than greed the 
london sun quoted its unidentified spokesman as saying 
in a letter published by the sun japans ambassador to britain 
kazuo chiba expressed astonishment and aversion that the sun 
should have carried an article such as this which is so full of 
ill will and which slanders a sovereign

afghanistans ambassador to india said 
today a un envoys proposal for an interim government in his 
country was an unworkable solution 
ambassador abdul samad azhar also repeated his governments 
accusations that the united states and pakistan were continuing to 
supply arms to afghan guerrillas fighting that countrys 
sovietbacked government which he called a violation of the april 
14 geneva accord 
the accord provided for the withdrawal of half of the soviet 
unions more than 100000 troops in afghanistan by midaugust and 
all of them by feb 15 1989 un observers and others say the 
soviets are complying with the pact 
diego cordovez the un envoy who mediated the accord has 
proposed the creation of a broadbased interim government to 
replace president najibs government which is dominated by the 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
the suggestion by diego cordovez it is against our 
principle our policy azhar told foreign and indian reporters 
at a news conference at the afghan embassy just down the road from 
the soviet embassy in new delhis diplomatic enclave 
what are the assurances that such a government can remain in 
power because such a government will demolish the existing policy 
the existing defense the existing security azhar asked then 
what will be the power of such a transitional government in 
afghanistan it has not any solid base 
when asked if his remarks meant that cordovezs proposal was 
unacceptable to the afghan government azhar described his remarks 
as a personal view to date no afghan official is believed to 
have expressed a similar view 
cordovez who has been working for a peaceful resolution of the 
afghan war since 1982 has proposed that a traditional tribal 
council decide the countrys future 
he said he had compiled a list of 30 impartial respected 
afghans who could help convene the council and possibly form an 
interim government of peace and reconciliation 
we believe a broadbased government should be proposed in 
afghanistan cordovez said sept 15 a former un 
secretarygeneral for political affairs cordovez is now foreign 
minister of ecuador but remains un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellars special representative on afghanistan 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979

leftist rebels attacked an army 
post with mortars and catapultlaunched dynamite killing at least 
15 soldiers in what appeared one of the most successful guerrilla 
operations in recent months 
eleven guerrillas were killed and 11 soldiers were wounded in 
the attack thursday in eastern morazan province according to a 
communique issued by the armed forces press office 
the raid on the army post began an hour after guerrillas lifted 
a road traffic ban that had paralyzed most transportation 
nationwide since monday in lifting the ban the rebels called on 
supporters to step up sabotage of vehicles that had ignored the 
measure 
marxistled rebels of the farabundo marti national liberation 
front have fought the the usbacked centrist government for 
nearly nine years about 65000 people mostly civilians have been 
killed 
lt salvador gonzalez said the attack began at 1 am with 
rebels firing mortar rounds and charges of tnt into a 
communications post on avocado hill north of corinto 120 miles 
northeast of san salvador 
gonzalez spokesman for the 3rd army brigade said the rebels 
used catapults similar to those used in medieval times to launch 
explosives into the base defended by about 50 men the guerrillas 
then attacked with rifle fire he said 
gonzalez spoke by telephone from san miguel headquarters for 
military operations in the eastern third of this small central 
american country 
the guerrillas also stepped up their sabotage of power 
transmission lines in several of el salvadors 14 provinces 
the rebels clandestine radio venceremos said the ban the 
fifth this year was lifted at midnight wednesday bus and truck 
traffic returned to normal thursday 
at least three vehicles were burned during the ban which 
reduced bus and truck traffic in the capital by about 70 percent 
traffic on provincial highways was almost completely halted 
some buses and trucks that operated since monday covered their 
license plates trying to avoid reprisals 
the guerrillas blew up about 35 utility posts or hightension 
towers after the transport ban began military sources said four 
eastern provinces were without electricity early thursday because 
of overnight sabotage

westerly breezes and atmospheric pressure zones in 
the caribbean may ultimately direct the course of hurricane helene 
as it brings its 130 mph winds westward from the midatlantic 
forecasters say 
but if the seasons fourth hurricane continues to strengthen it 
could brush aside any weather systems in its path 
once a system reaches a certain level like hurricane gilbert 
they are relatively unaffected by the atmosphere and weather they 
encounter they are just strong enough move the whole weather 
around them said randy lascody a meteorologist at the national 
hurricane center 
lascody said it will be at least until the weekend before 
forecasters will be able to accurately predict the course of 
helene which formed early wednesday at 75 mph and increased to 130 
mph winds today 
on saturday helene may be close enough to allow a 
reconnaissance flight from puerto rico said lascody 
then well have some hard data to make a judgment about the 
hurricane he said 
everyone is pretty gunshy now after gilbert said lascody 
helene is a pretty strong hurricane but its still far from 
everything it wouldnt be getting all this attention so soon if it 
wasnt right after gilbert 
gilbert slammed into the caribbean northern mexico and the 
texas gulf coast last week killing hundreds and inflicting 
billions of dollars worth of damage 
at 6 am edt today the center of the 250mile wide storm was 
at latitude 143 north and longitude 454 west or about 950 miles 
east of the caribbean island of barbados helene was moving 
westnorthwest at 10 mph and was expected to continue that course 
and speed through saturday with a gradual turn to the northwest 
thereafter 
its slow progress may give it time to draw more strength from 
warm atlantic waters 
but air currents from a lowpressure trough over the ocean may 
draw helene northward into the open atlantic away from the 
caribbean islands and north america said forecaster miles lawrence 
ocean storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach a 
minimum 74 mph the atlantic hurricane season runs from june 1 to 
nov 30 
two other hurricanes this season caused only minor damage in 
mexico and the us gulf coast

a campaign of deep pockets and titfortat 
attacks is being waged in indiana where the son of former us 
sen birch e bayh is trying to break the republicans 20year hold 
on the governors office 
the race between republican lt gov john m mutz and 
32yearold secretary of state evan bayh is shaping up as the most 
expensive in indiana history a campaign fought through 
pointcounterpoint tv commercials 
mutz 52 in recent weeks has questioned bayhs integrity 
charging the democrat plays fast and loose with the facts about his 
own record 
bayh this week claimed the mutz campaign stooped to a new 
low in indiana politics by engaging in character assassination 
he contended the attacks are prompted by poll results that show him 
leading by six to 10 points 
its not easy being behind said bayh its a very 
pressurefilled situation i think theres probably a good deal 
of frustration and pressure in the mutz campaign 
neither side has disclosed how much it has raised or spent and 
the latest finance reports are not due until early october but 
mutzs campaign hopes to raise 35 million and the bayh campaign 
expects more than 2 million 
that could eclipse the previous indiana spending record set in 
1980 when bayhs father and dan quayle the current gop vice 
presidential nominee spent a total of almost 5 million as quayle 
upset the threeterm incumbent 
bayh could become indianas youngest governor this century 
robert orr who at 70 is the nations secondoldest governor is 
barred from a third fouryear term indianas last democratic 
governor was roger branigin elected in 1964 
the gop has made an issue of bayhs age and inexperience two 
years as secretary of state to mutzs 21 in public service and 
tried to counter his famous name running a commercial with the 
line experience is earned not inherited 
the elder bayh has raised money behind the scenes and makes 
occasional appearances in his sons place some of evan bayhs top 
campaign aides worked for his father 
indianas high court earlier this year rejected a gop attempt to 
have bayh declared ineligible to run under the constitutions 
fiveyear residency rule bayh returned to indiana in 1984 after 
working as a lawyer in washington 
bayh in tv commercials claimed to have led a fight to return 
the profits from the state motor vehicle license branch to the 
people refused a raise and cut his office budget by 10 percent 
mutz countered that it was orr who pushed through legislation 
transferring the license branch from political to state control 
that there never was a final bill in the legislature offering bayh 
a raise and that bayh spent more money in his first year in office 
than his gop predecessor did in his last year 
the mutz counterattack on television ends with the line its 
a question of integrity 
bayh stood by his claims and charged that mutz favored the old 
license system took a 50 percent raise in 1985 and presided over 
threefold growth in his office budget 
a lastminute advertising blitz helped bayh defeat republican 
robert o bowen son of former governor and current health and 
human services secretary otis r bowen for secretary of state two 
years ago 
if he thinks that he can continue to portray halftruths and 
partial truths and innuendo as he did in 86 and is doing now in 
his television commercials we just will not let him get away with 
that said mutz

us officials today said they 
turned away a black fugitive who sought to join four escaped 
activists taking refuge at the us consulate 
the 22yearold man identified as max mankazana later was 
taken into custody by south african police according to his father 
barry walkley a us embassy spokesman said the man appeared 
at the consulate about 3 am thursday and appealed for refuge 
while we have deep compassion for the conditions involved it 
was clear to all parties that the situation did not correspond to 
that of the others granted temporary refuge walkley said the 
person voluntarily left the area 
three of south africas most prominent antiapartheid activists 
have been encamped at the consulate since sept 13 when they 
slipped away from guards while undergoing therapy at a hospital 
all three had been detained without charge for more than a year 
on wednesday a fourth activist clifford ngcobo joined them 
after a similar escape 
the four were to be visited today by anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu 
walkley did not specify why the united states viewed mankazanas 
case differently from the others police have not said why they 
were pursuing the young man but he had not been in detention 
unlike the other four who are known political activists 
ngcobo 30 said in a court affidavit that he was assaulted by 
police when he was detained april 23 his lawyers said they said 
he was to be examined soon by doctors 
ngcobo told the liberal weekly mail newspaper he was beaten and 
urinated blood for weeks after the alleged assault the weekly mail 
said its reporter spoke to ngcobo at johannesburg hospital only 
hours before he escaped 
south african authorities on thursday issued then later 
withdrew an arrest warrant for ngcobo he has not been charged 
with any crime 
the government has said it will not act against the three 
activists who escaped to the consulate last week 
they are murphy morobe and mohammed valli moosa leaders of the 
banned united democratic front the countrys largest 
antiapartheid coalition and vusi khanyile chairman of the banned 
national education crisis committee 
the three have called for the release of all political detainees 
and have refused to leave the consulate despite the government 
assurances 
us officials say the activists will not be expelled from the 
consulate despite a worldwide policy of not granting asylum in 
us diplomatic missions 
in another development law and order minister adriaan vlok said 
seven people had been arrested in connection with the bombing 
wednesday of the main white bus terminal in johannesburg that 
injured 19 people 
vlok did not identify the seven but said they were members of 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement which 
seeks to oust the whiteled government 
police also blamed the anc for a predawn bombing thursday at a 
johannesburg disco that injured 19 blacks police offered no

president pw botha and the un 
chief agreed today that independence plans for southwest africa 
are on track but botha said the cuban presence in angola threatens 
a regional peace settlement 
botha and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar who 
met for an hour discussed peace plans for the protracted guerrilla 
wars in angola and southwest africa also known as namibia 
perez de cuellar said the meeting left him with a feeling of 
relief 
we are moving forward in a very serious very effective manner 
to implement un resolution 435 he said the resolution 
establishes the process leading to namibian independence 
i think the implementation is closer than ever he added 
perez de cuellar was to fly this afternoon to angola for talks 
with the countrys marxist leaders who are supported by more than 
50000 cuban troops 
botha said he and perez de cuellar agreed on all matters related 
to namibian independence but botha added there is a problem 
that is the presence of the cubans as soon as we solve that 
problem we will solve the others more easily 
south africa has ruled namibia africas last colony for 73 
years the united nations has passed repeated resolutions calling 
for independence in the territory 
south africa has agreed to end its rule over namibia and allow 
un observers to oversee the transition to independence but only 
if the estimated 50000 cuban troops in neighboring angola withdraw 
cuba has agreed in principle to withdraw its troops but there 
is dispute over the timetable south africa wants the cubans out by 
june 1 the date it has offered to relinquish control over namibia 
the cubans meanwhile reportedly are seeking at least a 
twoyear period during which to withdraw 
usmediated talks involving angola cuba and south africa 
aimed at setting this timetable are to resume monday in 
brazzaville congo 
perez de cuellar said he did not feel it was proper for him to 
speak to the cubans about withdrawing from angola or to get 
involved in the brazzaville talks 
botha raised the issue of the cuban withdrawal at todays 
meeting but gave no public indication he was disappointed by perez 
de cuellars reluctance to get more directly involved 
botha said south africa had given approval for a un team to

liberation organization or any other palestinian group that does

even partial debt forgiveness for heavily indebted middleincome 
countries despite the urging of the head of the international 
monetary fund 
but the minister gerhard stoltenberg also said he expected 
that other major nations would join west germany in reducing 
interest rates on the massive debts owed by some poorer countries 
there is no cause to discuss debt forgiveness for the 
middleincome countries stoltenberg told reporters on the second 
day of discussions leading up to the formal annual joint meetings 
of the world bank and international monetary fund next week 
countries whose people have average incomes above 750 a year

argentina the world bank says the third world debt burden at the 
end of 1987 was 12 trillion

thousands of police patrolled west berlin to prevent violence 
during demonstrations planned by bank critics they charge that

least one shotgun fired at hans tietmeyer the shots missed the 
official of the west german finance ministry who helped plan the 
international banking talks 
stoltenberg also said he opposes any suggestions for a worldwide 
debt forgiveness calls for a global solution destroy the 
creditworthiness of debtor countries stoltenberg said 
he said debt problems should be solved on a casebycase basis 
and west germany would rather restructure debt and improve 
conditions than forgive loans the west german government this week 
announced additional concessions to the poorest countries we 
have verbal indications that the british and french governments 
will make similar decisions he said

the chinese government has offered to 
hold direct conditional talks with the exiled tibetan leader the 
dalai lama at a venue of his choice the chinese said in a 
statement released in new delhi today 
the message was conveyed to the dalai lama on wednesday through 
his representative in the indian capital a senior chinese diplomat 
said 
the buddhist leader has lived in exile in dharamsala 300 miles 
north of new delhi in himachal pradesh state since he fled tibet 
in 1959 
tsering tashi spokesman for the dalai lama in delhi said the 
exiled leader has received the invitation for talks and is 
deliberating with his advisers on a response 
the statement issued by the chinese embassy offered to hold 
talks in beijing hong kong or any of our embassies or consulates 
abroad if the dalai lama finds it inconvenient to conduct talks at 
these places he may choose any place he wishes 
the chinese diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
it was the first time his government has given the dalai lama a 
choice of venues 
the chinese condition for talking with the leader of the 
tibetans is that no foreigners should be involved the 
statement said 
the statement said the proposals suggested by the dalai lama in 
strasbourg france in june cannot be considered as the basis for 
talks with the chinese central government because it has not at 
all relinquished the concept of the independence of tibet 
in a speech delivered to the european parliament at strasbourg 
the dalai lama asked for a selfgoverning democratic political 
entity in tibet in association with the peoples republic of 
china 
in that speech the exiled leader for the first time recognized 
chinas right to handle tibets foreign policy and maintain troops 
on tibetan soil 
the chinese government statement urged the dalai lama to give up 
ideas of tibetan independence 
if the dalai lama is really concerned for the happiness of 
the tibetan people for the economic development and prosperity of 
the tibetan nationality he should truly give up the idea of the 
independence of tibet 
tibetan activists seeking independence have rioted in lhasa at 
least twice in the past year in march up to 24 people died in the 
provinces capital as monks and civilians fought chinese security 
forces similar riots in september and october 1987 left 14 people 
dead

portauprince haiti ap the new military government 
announced the retirements or discharges of 29 officers in an effort 
to appease rebellious soldiers on a purge of repressive commanders 
the troops continued to hunt henchmen of the deposed duvalier 
dynasty thursday but slowed down their campaign to remove hated 
commanders independent radio reports said 
the military government headed by lt gen prosper avril 
appealed for an end to a surge of lawlessness since saturdays 
coup but even a government spokesman acknowledged avrils tenuous 
hold on the government 
formal instructions have been passed on to the forces of order 
to arrest all individuals commiting acts of brigandage and 
pillaging said a military statement read on state television 
late thursday it said violators would be duly tried and 
punished 
sporadic gunfire continued through the night and there were 
continued reports of reprisal attacks but for the most part the 
capital was calm thursday 
avril a former army adjutant assumed the presidency after 
noncommissioned officers and other lower ranking enlisted men rose 
up against gen henri namphy and sent him into exile in the 
neighboring dominican republic 
since then rankandfile soldiers throughout the country have 
revolted against their commanders despositing a few of them 
handcuffed outside the army headquarters in portauprince the 
capital 
radio haiti inter reported the ouster thursday of two more 
commanders in the southwestern town of cotes de fer and the 
northern port of st marc bringing to 21 the number of commanders 
who served under namphy known to have been forcibly removed 
it was unclear whether the 21 commanders were included in the 29 
officers referred to in the armys later communique 
the commander of the 40man st marc barracks capt ernst 
ravix a suspected macoute sympathizer was ousted by troops a day 
after soldiers in the city fired on a crowd of demonstrators 
killing a 12yearold boy and wounding three other people the 
cotes de fer commanders were not identified 
the radio said that after radix was arrested and brought to 
portauprince soldiers launched a hunt for the tonton macoutes

information said the removal of unpopular officers now was 
proceeding peacefully indicating the soldiers had the tacit 
support of the government

possible 
namphys country retreat in foret des pins outside 
portauprince was among the homes reported pillaged 
the roman catholic churchs radio soliel broadcast an interview 
with an unidentified corporal who appealed to soldiers to stop 
firing their weapons into the air because it was hampering the 
search for tonton macoutes who sometimes fire weapons 
indiscriminately 
radio metropole meanwhile said staff at the army general 
headquarters issued a 16point declaration setting out their 
objectives for elections higher pay medical benefits subsidized 
housing and commissary privileges

a demonstration scheduled for thursday by political groups 
supporting the soldiers revolt was canceled after soldiers said 
they could not ensure the safety of the participants

a right of first refusal when the producer receives another offer 
for the gas

the federal trade commission said thursday it 
will consider easing the rules covering purchases of 10 percent or 
less of the stock of a business 
currently federal regulations require that individuals or 
businesses planning certain types or mergers or business 
acquisitions inform the ftc and the justice department in advance 
and then wait a specified time before completing the purchase 
the aim of the rules is to give the two agencies a chance to 
block mergers that violate antitrust laws 
the ftc said it is considering three possible changes in its 
rules and is seeking comment from businesses and others interested 
in the topic any final decision on the matter would also require 
agreement of the justice department 
possible changes include 
exempting purchases of 10 percent or less of a firms voting 
stock from the notification requirement on the ground that such 
acquisitions are unlikely to violate antitrust laws 
permitting such purchases but requiring that the stock be 
placed in escrow pending review by the ftc or justice department 
continuing to demand that the potential purchaser notify the 
federal agencies but not requiring it to tell the target company 
of its plans

the michigan supreme court on thursday let 
stand an appeals court order allowing a pregnant woman to have an 
abortion over the objections of her estranged husband 
however the justices extended until monday a stay that has 
prevented shawn lewis 24 of flint from getting an abortion 
a lawyer for the fetuss courtappointed guardian said he would 
file pleadings friday asking the us supreme court to accept an 
emergency appeal 
i think the michigan court of appeals is wrong the 
attorney james bopp jr said what we have here is the most 
elective of elective abortions its our view that roe did not 
legalize abortion on demand 
the appeals court said mrs lewis right to an abortion was 
established in the landmark 1973 us supreme court decision roe 
vs wade 
the state supreme court justices decided they would not tamper 
with the intermediate courts action they did not explain why 
the us supreme court has to act within 24 hours on an 
emergency request i would imagine that we should be getting a 
decision by monday said shelley spivack one of the volunteer 
american civil liberties union attorneys representing mrs lewis 
in similar cases the us supreme court has denied emergency 
appeals said spivack who expects the justices to follow that 
precedent 
the law is set right now she said to change it would 
require a full hearing before the us supreme court and that would 
take months and months 
if they want to revisit the 1976 decision about whether a 
husband has veto power over a womans abortion i would hope 
they would not do that at shawn lewis expense said michigan 
aclu executive director howard simon 
mrs lewis is at the end of her first trimester she became 
pregnant after a july 7 reconciliation with her husband she had 
filed for divorce in january and the couple wants to continue 
divorce proceedings 
her attorneys have said mrs lewis abided by the noabortion 
injunction for fear of jeopardizing her custody of her 16monthold 
child 
steven moss attorney for the husband carlton lewis said at a 
news conference thursday afternoon in flint that he had confidence 
in the us supreme court and expected them to take the appeal

boy streidel said

the south african activists at the us 
consulate in johannesburg agreed when they took refuge at the 
facility that they would not have contact with the news media the 
state department said thursday 
black activist winnie mandela who visited the consultate on 
wednesday had complained that us officials would not let the 
three men make direct contact with reporters 
but state department spokesman charles redman said the ban on 
media contact was among the conditions agreed to by the men and 
their legal representatives so that the consulate could function as 
usual 
these guidelines are designed to safeguard longterm interests 
of the three men and to allow our mission to carry out its normal 
operations and to avoid activities incompatible with our diplomatic 
presence in a foreign country he said 
redman told reporters that a fourth man has been given temporary 
refuge with the three who escaped detention in south africa 10 days 
ago clifford ngcobo entered the consulate seeking refuge on 
wednesday after apparently escaping police custody during a 
hospital visit redman said 
he indicates that he is a member of the banned united 
democratic front and had been in detention for five months prior to 
his escape said redman he is now in temporary refuge with the 
three other udf activists 
the situation of the first three activists is unchanged redman 
said 
they have not reached a decision on when or how they will 
leave our consular premises he said 
we cant serve as a spokesman for them but when these people 
arrived at the consulate there were certain guidelines agreed on 
with them redman said no restrictions of any kind have been 
placed on communications between the three men and their immediate 
family members their legal representatives and the support 
committee which they designated 
in accordance with these agreed guidelines the three men 
themselves have not had contact with the media

a survey of 1000 elementary and junior 
high school students found their favorite movies to be nightmare 
on elm street and friday the 13th 
the survey conducted by the junior league of charleston also 
found that while such violent rrated movies generally are rented 
by adults children manage to get access to them and prefer them to 
movies targeted at their age groups 
the results of this study suggest that adults rent rrated 
slasher films a report on the study said it does not 
conclusively indicate that they rent those films for minors but 
minors are viewing them 
rene mceldowney a marshall university statistics professor who 
headed the project said the league has begun to place posters in 
video stores that explain the movie ratings system the league also 
hopes to organize groups of seven to 10 people to discuss the issue 
of slasher movies 
i dont think parents are uncaring or malicious its just 
that theyre in a hurry and they dont have time to review the 
contents of each movie they rent for their children said paula 
flaherty of the junior league 
eightynine percent of the kanawha county junior high students 
surveyed recently said they watched nightmare while 77 percent 
of the elementary students surveyed reported that they had seen it 
for friday the 13th 86 percent of the junior high students 
said they had seen it compared to 66 percent of the elementary 
students 
wes bruce director of research for the county school system 
said the actual number of students watching these movies probably 
was slightly lower peer pressure and other factors could have 
influenced children to report that they had seen these movies when 
they actually hadnt he said 
but the point is the same bruce said these movies are 
readily accessible and accessibility is only going to increase 
of all the students surveyed nightmare was ranked as the 
most popular and friday the 13th placed second followed by 
predator and dirty dancing

federal agencies have identified more than 
53000 government computer systems that require security measures 
because they contain sensitive data officials told congress on 
thursday 
identifying the systems handling sensitive but unclassified 
information is among a series of steps including improved 
training programs for computer users mandated under the computer 
security act signed into law by president reagan early this year 
it appears that federal agencies are attempting to comply with 
the act the general accounting office said in a report presented 
to a house science subcommittee by howard rhile associate director 
of the gaos information management and technology division 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said that as of sept 
8 74 out of 84 agencies surveyed reported they had identified all 
sensitive computer systems under their jurisdiction 
it said 72 of the 74 agencies saying they had identified all 
sensitive systems reported the number of systems involved for the 
72 agencies the total came to 53443 computer systems 
defense agencies reported an estimated 52000 sensitive 
systems or about 97 percent of the total number reported by all 
agencies the gao said 
for the defense agencies the breakdown was navy 27000 
systems army 12000 air force 10000 other pentagon computer 
systems 3000 
jay plager an official from the office of management and 
budget told the panel that federal agencies have made a good 
start in moving to implement the legislation which calls for 
agencies to submit detailed computer security plans by jan 8 1989 
we believe that the act gives us a framework and provides the 
momentum for the government to address the security of federal 
computer systems he said in testimony before the transportation 
aviation and materials subcommittee 
plager said that in planning the security measures omb 
officials have been working closely with the national institute for 
standards and technology the national security agency and the 
office of personnel management 
the importance of adequate computer security he said is 
pointed up by the fact that next year the federal government will 
invest more than 17 billion in building and maintaining federal 
information technology systems systems which are critical to 
every major activity of our government

ford aerospace corp of newport beach calif 
will pay the government 7 million to settle claims that the 
company submitted false pricing data for bombing equipment sold to 
the air force the justice department announced thursday 
the false pricing allegations relate to three 1981 contracts for 
the sale of pave tack pods which are mounted on aircraft and 
through the use of lasers and computers enable the aircraft to 
guide bombs to targets 
in a settlement agreement the justice department alleged that 
ford certified and submitted cost or pricing information during 
negotiations which was not accurate complete or current 
using such data amounted to defective pricing the government 
said causing the air force to rely on inaccurate information 
leading to possible overpricing of the pods 
ford will pay 7 million to the government within 30 days under 
the terms of the agreement 
the company also must absorb all of the expenses including 
legal costs which it incurred in connection with the governments

thieves are stealing more than 10000 in tokens 
a day from the citys nearly 3000 subway turnstiles in an 
accelerating racket expected to cost the transit authority more 
than 1 million in revenue this year 
its a matter of prying open the door warping it and popping 
it open said russ broshous a ta vice president once warped 
it never fits properly again 
lawabiding passengers deposit their 1 brass tokens into a 
turnstile slot the tokens drop into a canvas bag which thieves 
have discovered is increasingly easy to reach on antiquated 
turnstiles 
ta officials say the metropolitan transportation authority is 
expected to approve 300000 friday for the emergency purchase of 
500 new quarterinch steel vaults to be installed into turnstiles 
at the worsthit stations 
the vaults which will replace the canvas bags will have 
tamperresistent screws and token clerks will open them with a 
higher security key than the ones now used if the vaults are 
effective theyll be installed systemwide broshous said 
people can regularly be seen hawking tokens at busy subway stops 
to people who dont want to wait in line at the booths where 
employees sell tokens 
people should realize when they buy those tokens that they are 
supporting someone who is preying on the system said al oleary 
spokesman for the transit police its drug abusers its the 
homeless its people who see an easy opportunity because thats 
what it is 
some stations are robbed over and over again 
a group of people will enter a station and look for police 
lookouts are posted near entrances another accomplice will 
distract the token clerk or block his view then a technician does 
the actual break in at the rate of about 10 to 15 seconds per 
turnstile then the whole group goes to another station 
its almost as if theres a predetermined plan as to how to 
carry it off broshous said 
there are 13 types of turnstiles in use in the subway systems 
463 stations the oldest date to the late 1920s are wooden and 
were designed to accept nickels 
in an era when people left their front doors open it was a 
secure turnstile by todays crackridden standards its not 
oleary said

a congressional panel thursday recommended 
linking us and world bank aid to burundi to that countrys 
efforts to end ethnic discrimination and willingness to allow 
international investigation into tribal massacres that claimed up 
to 20000 lives last month 
a resolution threatening suspension of us aid after six months 
and us opposition to world bank assistance after a year was 
adopted on a voice vote by the house foreign affairs subcommittee 
on africa 
all countries must be made to understand that if their armed 
forces kill civilians there will be repercussions in their 
relations with the united states rep william gray dpa 
asserted in support of the legislation introduced by rep ted 
weiss dny 
gray was referring to revenge slayings of an estimated 
500020000 hutu tribespeople in midaugust by burundi soldiers 
who belong mainly to the tutsi tribe a minority that has dominated 
the central african country for generations more than 60000 hutus 
fled to neighboring rwanda the panel was told 
the burundi army was responding to the massacre of an estimated 
20003000 people many of them tutsis in a preemptive attack by 
majority hutus they reportedly feared the tutsis were planning a 
repetition of the 1972 slaying of 100000200000 huus in one of 
modern africas bloodiest episodes 
the united states in early august launched a 45 million 
fiveyear population control program for burundi in addition to 
52 million in 1988 economic aid for health rural development and 
environment programs 
burundi is to draw 80 million in grants and concessional loans 
from the world bank this year making it the largest per capita 
recipient of such lowinterest credit weiss said 
state department witnesses at the joint hearing of the africa 
and human rights subcommittees backed the resolutions intent but 
they voiced misgivings that setting deadlines could undermine 
efforts of president pierre buyoya to promote equality in burundi 
and punish wrongdoing despite resistance by extremists among the 
ruling tutsis 
buyoya came to power in a bloodless coup a year ago and it is 
sadly ironic that these tragic events should have taken place under 
a government committed to policy reform and ethnic 
reconciliation said kenneth l brown deputy assistant secretary 
of state for african affairs 
the difference is tremendous between the buyoya government 
and previous burundi regimes brown said we feel this is a man 
who is on the right track and should be supported against those who 
would act against the interests of the burundian people 
those are noble words but actions speak louder than words 
said rep dan burton rind i suggest our state department 
convey to burundi that if officers engaged in genocide they 
should be brought to justice expeditiously 
buyoya has ruled out investigation by international bodies of 
what he says is an internal burundian problem

a major vatican document scheduled for release this 
month rules out priesthood for women but calls for greater respect 
for them a vatican official said thursday 
the document on the dignity of woman due to be made public 
sept 30 breaks little new ground the official said 
the roman catholic church has always barred women from the 
priesthood but pope john paul ii recently increased his efforts to 
promote respect for women 
the vaticans limitations on women have been one of the most 
vexing issues for the church in the united states and western 
europe the official who is familiar with the document and spoke 
on condition of anonymity conceded that it will disappoint some 
women 
the official said the popes document was very personal and 
called it a theological anthropological meditation on the 
meaning of christian womanhood 
the document says women cannot be priests because jesus did not 
choose them for such a role during his lifetime 
the pope rejected the argument that jesus was influenced by 
sociological factors such as the low status of women at the time 
the italian news agency agi which said it had access to the 
document quoted it as saying 
when christ called only men to be his apostles he did it in a 
totally free and sovereign way he did it with the same liberty 
with which in all his acts he recognized the dignity and vocation 
of women without conforming to the dominant practice and the 
tradition embodied in the legislation of his time 
john paul went on to say that jesus reserved for men the most 
important priestly duty the consecration of the eucharist thus 
indicating they only should be priests according to the agi report 
under the catholic faith consecration transforms bread into the 
eucharist or body of jesus during the mass 
if christ in instituting the eucharist linked it in such an 
explicit manner to the priestly service of the apostles it is 
right to think that by this he wanted to express the relation 
between man and woman that is what is feminine and what is 
masculine intended by god both in the mystery of creation and in 
the mystery of the redemption the pope wrote according to agi 
the pope has said repeatedly that the allmale priesthood is a 
result of jesus designs for the church rather than discrimination 
in a draft letter issued in april roman catholic bishops in the 
united states recommended that the church study the possibility of 
installing women as permanent deacons a step below priesthood 
american bishops have been among the strongest supporters of an 
expanded role for women 
in the new document john paul criticizes discrimination against 
women saying the truth revealed in the creation of human beings 
constitutes the principal argument against situations that are 
objectively damaging or unjust agi reported 
but he says men and women are different by nature with neither 
genders characteristics superior the agi report said 
women in the name of liberation from the domination of men 
should not try to appropriate masculine characteristics that do not 
correspond with their own original femininity he wrote 
according to agi 
there exists a wellfounded fear that further down this road 
women wont realize themselves and instead will deform and lose 
that which constitutes their essential richness 
the vatican official said the document repeats the popes 
support for women who want to raise children fulltime instead of 
working outside the house 
it also asks men to reflect on whether they see their wives as 
sex objects rather than partners

minister zbigniew messner resigned under fire for mishandling the 
economy 
a politburo statement issued thursday made no comment on the 
resignation saying only that the politburo discussed the decisions 
of parliament 
it urged participants to refrain from disclosing details of 
meetings held in preparation for the roundtable talks the 
government has promised on the future of the banned trade union 
movement solidarity 
all attempts to establish accomplished facts provoke emotions 
during different meetings publicize with the help of foreign mass

activists and interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak

roundtable talks would begin in midoctober 
the party at a plenum on aug 2728 appeared to exclude the 
possibility of two trade unions operating in a single plant the 
party has not spelled out its policy on trade union reform 
although it now appears that changes may be possbile 
at present of special significance for the labor movement is 
further improvement of its model and structure this should be 
favored by the amendments to the law on trade unions the 
politburo said thursday 
party leader wojciech jaruzelski criticized the government at 
the plenum during the strike wave at the meeting jaruzelski said 
the governments future would be decided at this months meeting of

peruvians protesting government austerity 
measures battled riot police with rocks during demonstrations 
thursday hours after two bombs exploded outside public offices and 
wounded 19 bystanders 
police said they detained more than 100 protesters but had no 
information about the number of people hurt 
about 200 striking civilian workers demanding higher pay at a 
navy shipyard threw rocks at security forces at plaza manco capac 
reporters said 
the government has declared the strike illegal and threatened to 
fire the employees if they fail to return to work by friday 
an austerity program announced by the government of populist 
president alan garcia on sept 6 led to widespread protests and 
looting in many provincial cities 
the program included a currency devaluation of 86 percent and 
elimination of costly government subsidies of basic consumer items 
which contribute to an inflation rate expected to reach 1000 
percent this year 
riot police tried to turn back a demonstration by 4000 
shantytown settlers who marched from limas outskirts toward the 
downtown area to protest price increases of up to 500 percent for 
some consumer items in the last two weeks 
police fired tear gas but the crowd was so large that most 
marchers managed to break past barricades and regroup at plaza 2 de 
mayo 15 blocks from the government palace 
police fired buckshot and tear gas grenades in plaza san martin 
to break up a demonstration of 2000 people led by women banging 
empty pots to protest the austerity program police acted when the 
protesters tried to march the six blocks from the plaza to the 
government palace 
an associated press newsman saw a girl about 10 years old 
bleeding from buckshot wounds in the face 
a bomb containing about five pounds of dynamite exploded at 
1025 pm wednesday 1125 pm edt at a side entrance to the 
economy ministry in downtown lima the blast severely injured a 
12yearold girl selling hot drinks from a street vendors cart a 
policeman and 17 other people many of them waiting for buses 
police said 
officers said the bomb was left beside the cart by procuban 
guerrillas 
another bomb the same size exploded three minutes later and 12 
blocks away outside an office of the agriculture ministry but 
caused no injuries 
police said pamphlets from the procuba tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement which were left at the site attacked the 
austerity measures as a cruel and unjustified blow to the poor 
elsewhere three hooded gunmen believed to be guerrillas from 
the maoist shining path movement killed a village mayor five miles 
outside trujillo a city 350 miles northwest of lima as his 
l5yearold son looked on wednesday police said

doctors who go short on sleep because of their 
rigorous hospital schedules can care for patients just as well as 
doctors who are wellrested according to a new study 
the report in fridays editions of the journal of the american 
medical association disputes other studies showing that prolonged 
sleep loss adversely affects mental functions said dr timothy f 
deaconson its chief author 
we conclude that the repetitive episodes of sleep deprivation 
associated with an everyothernight oncall schedule do not impair 
the performance of residents the study found 
sleep deprivation was defined as a lack of four continuous hours 
of sleep during the preceding 24hour period the study said 
that condition occurred in 89 percent of 20 nights covered by 
the study among the 26 residents at milwaukee county hospital 
researchers at the medical college of wisconsin in milwaukee 
led by deaconson investigated whether surgical residents 
performance was hurt by their sleep loss due to schedules that 
require them to work all night 
the residents kept diaries detailing the amount of sleep they 
received and then were tested for rapid handeye coordination 
visual and auditory skills and understanding 
i was not surprised at the results deaconson said in an 
interview thursday i was surprised at how onesided they were i 
was surprised there was very little difference between the sleep 
deprived residents and those who got rest 
i was expecting some people to show a difference and some not 
to and i was surprised that the results were so uniform he said 
the study comes as hospitals and doctors are looking into the 
possibility of reducing the number of hours residents are forced to 
work because of concerns for patient care 
deaconsons study said the issue should not be decided quickly 
criticism of traditional hospital oncall schedules should be 
based on objective data the study said the evidence available 
to date does not support abitrary recommendations to limit the 
working hours of residents

chris mccormack a trader with drexel burnham lambert inc

fire on an oil drilling platform in the north sea but slacked off 
on news that the blaze was under control analysts said

the market is showing very rational behavior to not react to 
rumors in advance of the opec meeting said bob baker an analyst 
with prudential bache securities inc the market is properly not 
expecting anything significant to come out of the price committee 
meeting but its a hopeful sign overall 
the fivemember pricing committee has no authority to decide 
policy but can call a meeting of all 13 members of the cartel oil 
prices hit twoyear lows recently because of the world oversupply 
of oil and reports that many opec members were exceeding production 
quotas 
the price committee meeting suggests the possibility that opec 
members might get together and set production limits that would 
raise world oil prices

the head of the international monetary fund is 
urging private bankers to write off some debts owed them by 
developing nations and said the industrial nations need to work 
more closely with the third world to improve the global economy 
there is no prosperity for the industrial countries without 
prosperity for the developing countries michel camdessus said at 
the start of world bankinternational monetary fund talks thursday 
in west berlin 
poor countries have been among the best customers of the richer 
industrial world but in recent years their heavy debt payments 
have forced them to cut back their purchases 
camdessus praised west germany canada and the nordic countries 
for reducing the debts owed them by the poorest third world 
countries 
the united states a major creditor of such countries has not 
forgiven any debts that would require action by congress where 
support is weak for foreign aid especially in an election year 
camdessus said private bankers also should write off some debts 
and said he recently has heard more of them discussing the 
possibility 
the world bank estimates that the third world debt burden at the 
end of 1987 was 12 trillion 
delegates from the 151 world bank and imf member countries as 
well as representatives of banking and industry have been arriving 
all week for the west berlin discussions 
the talks culminate with the sept 2729 joint meeting of the 
two sister organizations 
west berlin is teeming with police officers hoping to ward off 
attempts by leftist militants to disrupt the financial discussions 
in addition to west berlins 6000strong force 2700 other 
police officers have been brought in from across west germany to 
help with security 
officials fear violence could erupt in connection with 
demonstrations planned by opponents to the policies of the world 
bank and imf 
organizers of the demonstrations contend that third world 
countries are being impoverished by the repayment terms of their 
loans 
fears of possible violence on west berlin streets intensified 
with tuesdays failed ambush of a highranking west german finance 
ministry official in bonn 
addressing reporters camdessus also spoke about the recent rise 
of the us dollar saying the higher rate would make it harder to 
reduce the us international trade deficit 
a more costly dollar makes imported goods cheaper and more 
attractive to americans while making american goods more expensive 
and thus harder to export 
but camdessus also said the increase in the dollar does not 
justify too much concern 
he said that since the 1985 agreement between thenus treasury 
secretary james a baker iii and his counterparts from other major 
countries the dollar has continued to fluctuate but camdessus 
said the fluctuations are less violent and within a narrower range 
this is quite an achievement it has to be maintained he 
said 
he gets a chance to push his ideas at a meeting saturday of the 
group of seven which brings together the major powers of the 
noncommunist world nicholas brady the new us secretary of the 
treasury will be meeting for the first time with ministers from 
japan west germany britain france italy and canada

macmillan inc wants buyout bidding for it to 
continue and has backed out of a 236 billion buyout agreement 
while refusing to take a position on a higher offer 
less than two weeks after agreeing to a leveraged buyout led by 
the investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co macmillan said 
thursday it was withdrawing its support for the 85ashare bid 
but at the same time the publishing giant declined to take a 
position on the competing 241 billion bid by british publisher 
robert maxwell 
the company said its board wanted to continue the auction 
process that already has driven its stock price up by about 70 
percent since midmay 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange macmillan 
stock rose 50 cents a share to 8687 on thursday 
the kohlberg kravis bid included cash and securities while 
maxwell has said he would pay 8680 in cash for each of 
macmillans 278 million shares 
macmillan said thursday its board voted to withdraw its 
recommendation that shareholders accept the kohlberg kravis bid 
but it said kohlberg kravis had told macmillan it might amend its 
offer 
macmillans board decided to take no position immediately on 
maxwells offer in light of the boards determination to continue 
the auction process 
macmillan said its board affirmed its willingness to consider 
the maxwell offer and any other offers that may be made by maxwell 
or kkr or any other person and instructed its advisers to continue 
to seek to obtain maximum value for macmillans shareholders 
a spokeswoman for kohlberg kravis said the firm had no comment 
a spokesman for maxwell said the british publisher had no comment 
on the announcement 
financial analysts said a higher offer could appear but they 
disagreed over whether kohlberg kravis would drop out of the 
bidding 
bert boksen a media analyst for the investment firm raymond 
james financial corp in st petersburg fla said the action 
showed the macmillan board was offering the company to the highest 
bidder 
it appears like kkr is not going to increase their bid and if 
somebody can come up with a better bid than mr maxwells they 
will get the company boksen said 
boksen who previously estimated macmillans worth at about 90 
a share said there still was a chance someone could top maxwells 
bid 
bruce thorp media analyst for provident national bank in 
philadelphia said he thought kohlberg kravis was inclined to raise 
its offer and could do so by including more securities which 
would complicate comparison of the bid with maxwells allcash 
offer he said a third party may also emerge 
macmillan which has interests that include book publishing and 
information services and the berlitz language and katherine gibbs 
secretarial schools has been a takeover target since midmay when 
texas financier robert m bass proposed a buyout at 64 a share a 
premium over its price at the time of about 51 a share 
the company proposed a complicated restructuring in late may 
that included splitting the company into two separate companies 
publishing and information services and giving shareholders a 
stake in each along with a cash dividend 
the bass group blocked the restructuring plan by going to court 
and subsequently raised its offer for the company to 75 a share 
before dropping out of the bidding 
maxwell who has extensive media interests in britain and is one 
of the largest us magazine printers entered the fray in july 
with an 80ashare offer boosting it to 8680 a week ago 
maxwell has said he would be willing to drop his bid if he were 
allowed to purchase certain macmillan information services units 
for 14 billion

drexel burnham lambert inc lawyers want speedy 
access to the securities and exchange commissions evidence to 
prepare the wall street firms defense against fraud charges but a 
senior sec lawyer says that process could take months and trial 
probably is a year away 
thomas newkirk the secs chief litigation counsel made the 
remarks thursday when the first pretrial hearing on evidence 
gathering in the drexel case took place in manhattan federal court 
newkirk told us district judge milton pollack the enforcement 
agency must sort through more than 1 million documents to satisfy 
defense requests for information he also said the sorting process 
alone means the sec cannot even deliver those documents until 
middecember 
asked later by reporters for his opinion on when the trial 
finally could proceed newkirk said it will take at least a year 
to get ready for trial 
the hearing produced no decisions however it marked the first 
confrontation between drexel and sec lawyers in open court since 
the agency announced its unprecedented enforcement action sept 7 
against the investment firm and some key employees notably 
highyield bond financier michael milken 
the defendants were accused of scheming with nowimprisoned 
speculator ivan boesky to trade on inside information manipulate 
stock bully drexel clients and engage in other securities frauds 
if they lose drexel and the other defendants could face 
penalties in the hundreds of millions of dollars and possible 
expulsion from the securities business the firm has denied 
wrongdoing 
the sec action stemmed directly from revelations by boesky who 
is cooperating with federal investigators and is expected to be 
their star witness in the case 
the drexel defense team comprised of some the most astute and 
expensive attorneys in the country told pollack it could not even 
estimate a trial date until the sec had supplied at least some of 
the documents requested 
defense lawyers arthur liman and thomas curnin also questioned 
pollacks proposal to merge the evidencegathering processes in the 
drexel case with those in civil suits he is hearing against boesky 
liman said that could cause complications and delays 
all we want is our own case liman said the sec brought a 
case against our clients wed like our case to be a separate case 
with the sec 
pollack assured the defense team he was interested in 
efficiently completing the evidencegathering phase and moving to 
trial 
quickly settling the pretrial factgathering issue is crucial to 
drexels defense strategy because a federal grand jury is 
investigating the firm and may deliver an indictment soon lawyers 
familiar with the case have said 
if that happens the criminal charges would take precedence over 
the secs civil charges and severely limit drexels ability to seek 
evidence because of stricter federal rules in criminal cases 
pollack did not rule on any evidencegathering guidelines and 
set another hearing for oct 11 
at that time the drexel defense is expected to ask pollack to 
disqualify himself from the case on grounds it is basically 
unrelated to the civil suits against boesky 
the sec had requested that pollack take the case bypassing the 
normal procedure of random judge selection on grounds that he is 
intimately familiar with the boesky litigation 
pollack an octogenarian jurist known for his toughness and 
progovernment leanings is expected to reject any defense move to 
seek another judge 
asked whether the sec is happy that pollack appears determined 
to remain in charge newkirk told reporters were happy with any 
unbiased judge

in what may be an industry record delta air 
lines has announced orders and options for 215 jets from two 
companies in a deal analysts said would be worth at least 6 
billion 
atlantabased delta said it ordered nine md11s from mcdonnell 
douglas corp and nine 767300ers from boeing co it also ordered 
pratt amp whitney pw4000series engines to power the planes in a 
deal worth 175 billion 
the company did not put a value on the options for the remaining 
197 aircraft but analysts said the total would be more than 6 
billion some put the deal at more than 10 billion well above the 
record 504 billion purchase of 100 boeing and 30 airbus industrie 
jets last may by international lease finance corp of beverly 
hills calif 
these new orders and optionshighlight our international and 
domestic growth plans and commitment to maintaining the most modern 
fleet of aircraft available ron allen delta chairman and chief 
executive officer said in a statement 
delta the nations third largest airline also announced 
options on 31 more md11s 16 more 767300ers 100 md88s and 50 
boeing 757232s 
delta had been known to be contemplating a large order for 
months it did not provide a total cost of the package 
spokesman jim lundy said delta chose the md11 because of the 
nature of the airlines routes in the pacific where most of the 
planes will be used 
the twinengine 767300ers for extended range will be 
used on transatlantic flights and will carry about 220 passengers 
the md11 is a threeengine plane that in deltas configuration 
will carry 276 passengers 
analyst robert decker with duff amp phelps in chicago said the 
md11 order was the first by a domestic airline but only would 
affect other airlines decision if it caused mcdonnell douglas to 
lower the price of the jet 
delta operates a fleet of 383 airplanes and the purchases 
announced thursday will be used for expansion and replacement 
according to spokesman jim lundy 
but the md11s generally were intended to expand the airlines 
fleet lundy said 
deltas always been one that kept a modern fleet and the 
order says theyre going to maintain their position and that they 
intend to keep pace with the growthin the consolidated 
industry said lee howard executive vice president of airline 
economics inc a consulting firm in washington dc 
the order was the second large purchase for delta since january 
1986 when the atlantabased company ordered 80 md88s from 
mcdonnell douglas and 185 engines from pratt amp whitney in a deal 
worth 25 billion 
delta said thursday it still has options remaining on 42 
757200s 12 767300s and 85 md88s 
lundy said the airline had not decided how the new purchases 
would be financed but said the company has a 1 billion line of 
bank credit and was in an excellent financial position 
delta which has about 48000 employees earned 30683 million 
on 692 billion in revenue during the fiscal year ended june 30 
boeing commercial airplanes spokesman tom cole said the nine 
767s would be worth roughly 745 million including spare parts and 
training 
howard said the order was just the latest in what already was a 
record planebuying year 
boeing now has received orders for 316 767s including 48 this 
year the company earlier this year set an aircraftindustry record 
for planes ordered in one year and the delta order boosts that to 
485 planes worth about 22 billion cole said 
at a price of about 44 million apiece the 50 757s would be 
worth about 22 billion if all orders are exercised cole said 
the 16 767300ers would be worth approximately 115 billion spare 
parts and training could increase those figures 
mcdonnell douglas spokesman don hanson said his company does not 
release price information about its planes industry experts 
estimate an md11 a successor to the dc10 costs about 100 
million and a 142passenger md88 costs about 25 million at 
those prices the 40 md11s would be worth 4 billion and the 100 
md88s 25 billion 
the first 767s will be delivered to delta in early 1990 with 
the initial md11s delivered to delta in the spring of 1991

the chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee says hes not happy with the securities and exchange 
commissions decision not to pursue enforcement action in the 
largest municipal bond default in history 
rep john dingell dmich said the secs decision in the 225 
billion bond default by the washington public power supply system 
is not well received by wppss bondholders or by me 
investors in municipal securities have the same right to 
accurate and full disclosure as any other investors and liability 
should fall firmly on those who defraud them dingell said 
dingell said the secs plans to terminate the wppss 
investigation will be looked at and addressed vigorously by the 
committee at the earliest possible time 
in a massive report released thursday the commissions staff 
laid out a factual account of the supply systems problems in 
trying to build two nuclear power plants in washington state but 
drew no legal conclusions 
the report found in general that wppss tried to put the best 
image possible on the deepening construction and financial problems 
that led up to the default in 1983 and in some cases avoided 
disclosure of negative developments 
others including the bond underwriters bond counsel and the 
rating agencies were not agressive enough in asking questions and 
exercising due diligence to ensure that investors were aware of 
the supply systems mounting problems the report stated 
sec chairman david ruder said that while he was very concerned 
about the failure of the system in the sale of the wppss bonds a 
prolonged enforcement action would be a drain on the commissions 
resources 
ruder also said it would be difficult to determine who was 
responsible for deficiencies in the bonds disclosure reports 
and that bondholders already were trying to recover their 
investments through a civil trial currently underway in tucson 
the commission did decide to offer for public comment a proposed 
rule that would impose stricter disclosure requirements on issuers 
of municipal bonds and the securities firms that sell them 
oregon democratic rep ron wyden a member of the house energy 
committee said he was concerned the sec is indicating it doesnt 
have the money and staff to pursue such massive cases 
it sends a message that if you mess up mess up big because 
the principal regulatory agency doesnt have the resources to 
pursue enforcement action said wyden 
the sec report concluded the default resulted from extensive 
cost overruns and construction delays at wppss projects no 4 and 
no 5 in washington state 
cost of the projects had soared from an initial estimate of 
slightly over 2 billion to almost 12 billion before construction 
was halted in 1981 
both projects were abandoned in january 1982 and in 1983 wppss 
quit making payments on the bonds after the washington state 
supreme court held that the utilities contracts with the 
consortium were illegal and thus unenforceable without payments 
from the 88 participating utilities many in other states wppss 
defaulted 
as early as 1978 the report said wppss recognized it could 
face longterm financing problems top supply system officials told 
the 88 utilities participating in the projects in late 1980 that 
wppss cash flow coverage was so low that there was almost none 
at times the report said 
the report said the participants also in late 1980 asked the 
supply system to study the possibility of slowing down construction 
or terminating the two projects 
the request was kept confidential because of its possible impact 
on the financial markets and wppss contiuned to sell bonds more 
than 400 million worth before the projects were scrubbed the 
report said 
the report found that wppss also failed to adequately disclose 
in the official bond statements that forecasts showed a drop in the 
demand for electricity in the northwest 
as for others involved in the wppss bond sales the report said 
underwriters were aware of the supply systems problems but did 
not conduct due diligencetype investigations to verify wppsss 
disclosure reports as they do with other securities sales 
the underwriters contend they had no legal obligation to conduct 
an investigation and it was not industry practice to do so in 
competitive municipal bond sales 
wppsss bond counsel and special counsel despite indications 
of legal difficulties with provisions requiring the utilities to 
pay for the plants whether they were finished or not gave the bonds 
a clean bill of health 
rating agencies depended too much on information supplied by 
wppss and did too little study of their own in rating the bonds

a group of brokerage firms and an industry 
association are going to court to try to block a new state 
regulation that would guarantee investors the right to sue their 
stockbrokers 
nine major brokerage houses and the securities industry 
association filed the federal lawsuit thursday contending the 
regulation is unconstitutional 
if the federal government were going to do this it might be 
unwise and unnecessary but for states to do it its also 
unconstitutional said gerald f rath an attorney for the 
plaintiffs 
the regulation would forbid stockbrokers from asking their 
clients to sign agreements to submit all disputes to binding 
arbitration many brokerage firms alarmed by a rash of lawsuits 
after the october 19 1987 stock market crash have began 
requesting such agreements from all new clients 
massachusetts is the first state to propose a regulation against 
the practice but 16 other states reportedly may adopt similar 
rules a us house subcommittee also is considering legislation 
that would bar brokerage houses from requiring customers to sign 
arbitration agreements before opening accounts 
if upheld by the courts the massachusetts regulation will take 
effect jan 1 1989 
state officials who unveiled the regulation thursday in 
washington said they anticipated the legal challenge 
were very confident that we are on firm constitutional 
ground said deputy secretary of state martin t meehan weve 
been working with the attorney generals office for months and we 
expect to win in court 
meehan said the antiarbitration guidelines were intended to 
give investors the option of suing brokers in the event of a 
dispute and were drafted because state officials received hundreds 
of complaints from investors after the october crash 
most brokerage firms require customers to settle disputes 
through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the new york stock 
exchange the national association of securities dealers or other 
market organizations 
arbitration generally is cheaper and faster than suing but 
investors have only a limited right to appeal while big 
institutional investors can negotiate contracts with brokerages 
individual investors usually have little choice but to agree to 
arbitration 
the lawsuit asks for an injunction against the regulation and 
names secretary of state michael connolly and state securities 
division director barry c guthary as defendants 
the suit contends arbitration agreements are consistent with the 
1934 securities and exchange act and that the 1925 federal 
arbitration act took away from states the power to pass legislation 
governing such agreements 
under the new regulation stockbrokers could have have their 
licenses suspended or revoked if they refused to accept an 
investors business without an arbitration agreement 
by doing that the suit claims the massachusetts 
antiarbitration regulations purport to place arbitration 
agreements on a different footing from other agreements 
meehan the deputy secretary of state disagreed were not 
claiming that the contract is illegal he said were also not 
claiming to have the authority to get into the reform of 
arbitration mechanics but we clearly have the right to give 
investors the choice as to whether or not they are forced to enter 
into these agreements 
the nine brokerage houses that filed the suit are 
dean witter reynolds inc donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
securities corp drexel burnham lambert inc fidelity brokerage 
services inc kidder peabody co merrill lynch pierce fenner 
amp smith inc painewebber inc prudentialbache securities inc 
shearson lehman hutton inc and smith barney harris upham amp co 
a securities and exchange commission survey this year of 65 
firms handling 90 percent of all customer accounts found virtually 
all require arbitration particularly for customers who borrow 
money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock 
options 
but the securities industry assocation said that since 1981 the 
sec has received more than 156000 complaints by private investors 
against brokers and only 147 involved arbitration

republicans stalling action on a bill to raise 
the 335 minimum wage are vowing to continue their filibuster 
until democrats accede to an 80 percent subminimum for any newly 
hired employee 
a vote on a second democratic attempt to break the filibuster 
was scheduled today while gop leaders conceded that some support 
for their delay tactics may be wavering others vowed to continue 
the parliamentary fight if necessary until congress adjourns in 
midoctober 
on a 5343 vote six short of the 60 needed the senate 
refused thursday to limit to 30 hours further debate on the bill by 
sen edward m kennedy dmass to raise the wage floor to 375 
an hour in january 415 in 1990 and 455 in 1991 
i hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle will 
have a change of heart overnight senate majority leader robert 
c byrd dwva said after the vote its only clear that there 
is a deliberate attempt to stall action on this bill 
the stalemate has existed since sept 17 when sen orrin hatch 
rutah filed an amendment that would establish a 90day subminimum 
rate at the current floor of 335 an hour for new hires the 
subminium would be raised to 365 an hour in 1991 
president reagan vice president george bush and bushs running 
mate sen dan quayle rind all have demanded that any increase 
in the minimum wage be coupled with the creation of a subminimum 
while bush quayle and hatch have referred to the proposal as a 
training wage or a youth training wage hatchs amendment 
does not have the word training in it nor any age limitations 
on its application 
immediately after hatchs amendment was introduced kennedy 
filed a substitute for it that would slightly expand a currently 
allowed but littleused 85 percent subminimum wage for fulltime 
students working less than 20 hours a week 
because hatchs subminimum proposal would die under the senates 
rules if kennedys is approved republicans have refused to allow 
votes on it or any other amendments 
they dont want to vote on the kennedy amendment because it 
will prevail and they dont like that kennedy said he said it 
would represent a vote against the plan that bush hatched 
bush in the past two weeks has said he supports an increase in 
the minimum wage never specifying how much but only if it is 
accompanied by a subminimum floor 
quayle has repeatedly advocated an increase to 4 an hour over 
two years coupled with a subminimum 
were not going to get a fair hearing on the training wage 
because the labor leaders dont want it complained senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas its not the republicans 
vs the demorats its the republicans vs the labor leaders

the west german finance minister today rejected 
even partial debt forgiveness for heavily indebted middleincome 
countries despite the urging of the head of the international 
monetary fund 
but the minister gerhard stoltenberg also said he expected 
that other major nations would join west germany in reducing 
interest rates on the massive debts owed by some poorer countries 
there is no cause to discuss debt forgiveness for the 
middleincome countries stoltenberg told reporters on the second 
day of discussions leading up to the formal annual joint meetings 
of the world bank and international monetary fund next week

least one shotgun fired at hans tietmeyer the shots missed the 
official of the west german finance ministry who helped plan the 
international banking talks 
stoltenberg also said he opposes any suggestions for a worldwide 
debt forgiveness calls for a global solution destroy the 
creditworthiness of debtor countries stoltenberg said 
he said debt problems should be solved on a casebycase basis 
and west germany would rather restructure debt and improve 
conditions than forgive loans the west german government this week 
announced additional concessions to the poorest countries we 
have verbal indications that the british and french governments 
will make similar decisions he said 
stoltenberg also said major industrial nations such as the 
united states should strive for a closer alignment of their 
economic policies and that he wants to avoid strong swings in 
foreign exchange rates

greenwald chairman of the companys chrysler motors carmaking 
arm we are going through a transition year of dropping some of 
the old models 
he said the truck market should not be a problem we dont see 
any strong competition on our minivan he said

dodge caravan and plymouth voyager both frontwheel drive 
vehicles since then other domestic and foreign makers have jumped 
into the rapidly expanding market but chryslers two models have 
held the market lead 
we see us holding our own maybe a little plus greenwald 
said 
during the past several years the no 3 us automaker has lost 
market share in cars while gaining in light trucks 
during the same period it has dealt with the acquisition of 
american motors corp while amc brought employees that sometimes 
performed redundant work of their chrysler counterparts the 
acquisition brought hotselling jeep vehicles to the chrysler 
lineup 
god bless minivans and jeeps said ben bidwell president 
for products and marketing for chrysler motors were going to 
have to stretch to equal the 88 volume and market share 
at the end of last month chrysler held 143 percent of the 
usmade car market and 227 percent of the domestically made 
light truck market

transmission called ultradrive a 25liter fourcylinder engine 
and antilock braking systems on more vehicles including all four 
wheels on the jeep cherokee

air bags as standard equipment than any other automaker and that by 
the 1990 model year air bags will be standard on usbuilt cars

shuttered texas plate mill to iraq because a letter of intent had 
expired without a contract for final sale 
the usx mill which is located in baytown and once employed 
about 2000 workers has been idle for two years 
at this time there are no commitments for the sale to iraq or 
any other party the steelmaker said in a statement 
usx chairman david m roderick said he agreed to a request by 
rep jack brooks dtexas whose district includes the plant not 
to contract for another sale to iraq for at least six months 
birmingham steel corp of birmingham ala has said it was 
interested in buying the plant if the iraqi deal fell through

115 million for the building and equipment while iraq offered 
100 million 
but usx spokesman william p ryder said birmingham steel had not 
made a formal offer for the plant 
the sale of the mill to iraq sparked sharp criticism from a 
number of sectors including lawmakers and the united steelworkers 
union of america 
rep jack fields rtexas argued that the deal would reduce 
american steelmaking capability and increase domestic steel prices 
fields said iraqs ambassador to the united states abdulamir 
alanbari had told him a 1 million down payment had been made to 
usx but the steelmaker denied it had received any money

the new centerleft government said 
thursday it welcomes foreign investment and was concerned its 
recent decision to assume operating control of much of the nations 
oil industry would be misinterpreted as a nationalization 
energy minister diego tamariz met with foreign correspondents to 
stress that the decision to assume operating control of various 
stages of production and refining over the next several years did 
not mean the government has the intention of taking action 
against the assets of foreign companies through nationalizing 
them 
the government said earlier this week that the state oil company 
cepe would assume control next year of the pipeline which brings 
oil from the eastern jungle when the pipeline service contract 
with us oil company texaco inc ends in 1989 
it said cepe would take control of production wells now operated 
by texaco when production contracts end in 1990 and also would buy 
two refineries owned by private investors 
we are worried that this may create an image abroad that we do 
not want foreign investment in the country when in fact we are open 
to foreign investment in terms of mutual benefit tamariz said 
the government has said it would respect oil exploration 
contracts that the previous government of conservative president 
leon febres cordero signed with 13 foreign companies 
the principal concern is that the image we have given is not 
real that is to say the image of a government nationalizing when 
we are taking control of operations that correspond to the state 
company under contract terms tamariz said 
texaco produces nearly 80 percent of ecuadors daily output of 
310000 barrels 
president rodrigo borja a moderate leftist took office aug 10 
pledging to impose controls on the freemarket economic system 
favored by febres cordero he had indicated during his campaign 
that he also would be more selective than his predecessor about 
foreign investment in ecuador

decided there was a need for more power approved the projects and 
drew up the agreements under which 88 public utilities would 
participate in building the plants and sharing the power said 
wppss employee harlan r kosmata

elected or appointed to several panels that had decision power over 
the projects

projects he also was secretary for the participants committee a 
group of seven people that made decisions for all the utilities in 
the projects
