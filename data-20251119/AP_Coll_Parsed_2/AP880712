secretary of state george p shultz 
indicated tuesday that he and philippine leaders have scored a 
breakthrough in stalled talks on the future of us military bases 
in the philippines 
president corazon aquino said after tuesdays discussions we 
both hope that the talks would be over by the end of this month 
shultz told a news conference im more than ever convinced 
that there is a very strong mutuality of interest in the security 
field and all the reason in the world that somehow well be able to 
work out a continuing partnership a review of the 41yearold 
bases agreement which expires in 1991 has been marked by calls 
from some people for more compensation from the united states and 
by demonstrations against the us military presence 
the review began in april and stalled over the issue of how much 
washington should pay each year for the subic bay naval base clark 
air base and four smaller military installations 
shultz on a 36hour visit to manila met with mrs aquino 
foreign secretary raul manglapus defense secretary fidel v ramos 
and prominent legislators 
he later left for hong kong arriving there wednesday for a 
oneday stay hong kong was the fifth stop on the secretarys 
ninenation asian and pacific tour he earlier visited thailand 
malaysia and indonesia and will proceed after hong kong to china 
south korea japan and the marshall islands 
both the us and filipino sides refused to discuss details of 
the compensation proposals 
house speaker ramon mitra told reporters if the philippine 
side gets favorable conditions i presume this is going to 
register very well among members of the house 
us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
reasonable compromise on the bases could mean increased support by 
washington of manilas war against the 19yearold communist 
insurgency 
under the present accord the united states gives manila 180 
million a year in economic and military aid the bases are the 
largest us military facilities outside the continental united 
states 
manglapus said last april that 12 billion a year was a more 
realistic figure 
shultz said the us military had worked out options in case the 
bases were ousted but the best choice was to stay in the 
philippines 
he said the two sides had perhaps identified some methods that 
might work in reaching a compromise 
shultz also said the philippine military had improved in the 
past two years 
there is a far greater degree of professionalism they are 
better equipped there is a clear mission and a record 
increasingly of success he said 
ramos said shultz promised to expedite the delivery of us 
military equipment to the philippine military the united states 
this year provided more than 85 million in military help

the governing nationalist party on tuesday 
eased a 39yearold ban on visits to taiwan by mainland china 
residents and approved expanding indirect trade with beijing to 
include raw materials 
the new policy toward rival communist china approved by the 13th 
nationalist party congress after several days of debate also 
suggested taiwan journalists and athletes may be allowed to go the 
mainland 
under the new policy the nationalist party or kuomintang will 
review requests from mainland chinese to travel to taiwan if close 
relatives are gravely ill or die 
intellectuals from mainland china who are opposed to 
marxismleninism or have fought to maintain academic freedom will 
be allowed to come to taiwan if invited 
further relaxation will depend on whether and how the mainland 
responds to our new policy hsiao changle head of the 
nationalists mainland operations department told a news 
conference 
last october the nationalists ended a longstanding ban on 
travel to china so taiwan residents could visit relatives for 
family reunions more than 100000 have made the trip since 
the ban on travel across the taiwan straits was imposed when the 
nationalists fled to this island in 1949 after losing a civil war 
to the communists on the chinese mainland the nationalists 
government still claims to be the rightful ruler of all china and 
refuses all official contact with beijing 
hsiao said that also under the new policy mainland chinese 
students studying in the united states or europe can apply to visit 
taiwan through an unidentified private organization beginning in 
august or september 
he said taiwan athletes may be allowed to compete on mainland 
china in events sponsored by private organizations and said the 
islands olympic committee would study the possibility of sending a 
team to beijing for the 1990 asian games 
the party statement also indicated reporters may soon be allowed 
to travel to the mainland for newsgathering but did not propose 
relax other travel restrictions opposed by many taiwanese 
although no direct trade links exist between taiwan and china 
the nationalists tolerate a flourishing trade through third 
countries that could reach a record 2 billion this year 
taiwan government officials last year announced 29 items could 
be imported from china indirectly but the list did not include raw 
materials and agricultural products now to be tolerated

counterpart son sung pil 
in view of the ardent aspirations of separated family members 
it is our imperative task to find out the whereabouts of their 
dispersed family members and relatives and help them to meet 
freely kim said in the message 
korea was divided into the sovietbacked north and 
ussupported south at the end of world war ii it is estimated 
that at least 10 million people were separated from their relatives 
by the division and during the korean war in 195053

mostly mozart was mostly marvelous 
the 22nd season of new york citys alliterative summer musical 
festival opened tuesday night with a gala concert featuring not 
one but two superstar soloists american mezzosoprano frederica 
von stade and soviet emigre pianist vladimir feltsman 
both made strong impressions miss von stade sang parto 
parto an aria from mozarts last opera la clemenza di tito 
and both of cherubinos arias from le nozze di figaro she 
sounded at ease in all three her tone aristocratic yet free and 
unaffected her technique was flawless in the difficult runs of the 
first selection with only a hint of strain in the highest part of 
her register 
cherubino is perhaps miss von stades most famous role on stage 
and she demonstrated why communicating the restless energy of a 
lovesick young boy with simple directness 
feltsman who arrived in this country just last year provided 
an elegant performance of mozarts last piano concerto no 27 in 
bflat major this work written less than a year before the 
composer died strikes a mood of serenity and triumph with little 
of the turmoil and tragedy that mark the concertos preceding it 
feltsman played with grace and clarity 
ironically the least satisfying selection of the night was a 
collaboration between the two the concert aria for soprano piano 
and orchestra chio mi scordi di te which mozart wrote for an 
18yearold english singer with whom he had fallen in love 
what sets this difficult aria apart is the intricate interplay 
between the female voice and the piano each seeming to address the 
other in long loving phrases miss von stade and feltsman missed 
the emotional spark and too often seemed to be going through their 
paces rather than communicating 
the opening program which is being repeated tonight and 
televised live on the public broadcasting service was true to the 
title mostly mozart but with a little something else thrown in 
conductor gerard schwartz led a spirited performance of haydns 
grand and humorous symphony no 100 known as the military 
symphony the concert opened with the overture to mozarts opera 
die entfuhrung aus dem serail 
it all went to show once again that mozart who died in poverty 
in vienna at the age of 35 left behind a unique and inexhaustible 
supply of musical riches what other composer could serve as the 
mainstay of a music festival that puts on concerts for seven weeks 
year after year 
highlights of the current season performed in lincoln centers 
avery fisher hall include mozarts rarely heard early opera 
lucia silla haydns lord nelson mass and a chamber 
concert devoted entirely to schubert

democratic presidential nomineetobe michael 
dukakis pondered possible running mates on monday with jesse 
jackson pressing more strongly than ever for a spot on the ticket 
signs pointed to an announcement within a few days 
dukakis and his top adviser paul brountas met at dukakis 
house monday morning brountas then traveled to washington to meet 
with jackson who said for the first time monday that he would take 
dukakis up on an offer to join the ticket 
jackson told reporters after his meeting with brountas that it 
is selfevident that he wants the job and said he assured 
brountas he would be a loyal vice president 
if it was offered to me i would accept it jackson said he 
has said repeatedly he deserves an offer of the no 2 spot but up 
until monday he had declined to say publicly what his answer would 
be if that offer were extended 
brountas said the two had an excellent meetingvery 
productive but declined to provide any details of the discussion 
afterward he flew back to boston for a latenight meeting with 
dukakis 
after a 45minute session at dukakis home with campaign 
manager susan estrich in attendance brountas was asked if a 
decision had been made 
no comment he said 
asked if the selection process was over brountas responded 
he dukakis can always ask more questions if he wants 
dukakis is expected to announce his choice this week before 
heading to the democratic national convention which opens next 
monday some aides said an announcement could come as soon at 
tuesday but others said there was still no timetable 
although the massachusetts governor faces a budget crisis at 
home that threatens to hurt his national candidacy he arrived at 
the statehouse late because of the brountas meeting dukakis had 
planned to leave within three hours but ended up staying for nearly 
seven still a few hours shorter than his usual workday 
have a good evening was all dukakis would say to reporters 
as he left for home after a meeting with three top campaign aides 
including campaign manager susan estrich 
several campaign aides said privately that the time at home was 
to be spent working to pick a running mate he hasnt made up his 
mind yet said one dukakis aide or if he has he hasnt told 
anybody 
jackson had been scheduled to meet with brountas last friday 
but the meeting was postponed with brountas saying he needed more 
time to receive and review information from the jackson 
campaign the dukakis campaign had requested detailed personal 
financial and medical information from jackson and other prospects 
the civil rights leader has said he is the most qualified to 
share the ticket with dukakis and has called the others known to be 
under consideration unknown quantities they include sens john 
glenn of ohio albert gore jr of tennessee lloyd bentsen of texas 
and bob graham of florida and reps richard gephardt of missouri 
and lee hamilton of indiana 
dukakis aides have been aggravated by jacksons aggressive 
effort to portray himself as the logical running mate and by an 
apparent effort by jackson campaign manager gerald austin to 
discourage the selection of gore jackson said austins comments 
were unathorized 
during a weekend campaign swing through several western states 
dukakis responded tersely when asked if jackson would have veto 
power over his decision he said the decision was his alone to make 
dukakis is to travel tuesday night to washington where he is 
scheduled to hold a series of capitol hill meetings on wednesday 
and also address the annual convention of the naacp 
when he arrives back in boston on wednesday night dukakis will 
have two work days left to make good on his promise to resolve the 
states budget problems by the end of the week 
on his desk is an 1175 billion spending plan for fiscal 1989 
which began july 1 legislative leaders have urged dukakis to use 
his lineitem veto power to reduce that spending plan dukakis also 
is awaiting legislative passage of a politically sensitive plan to 
eliminate the 370 million deficit remaining from fiscal 1988 
the governor is scheduled to take saturday off and fly to 
atlanta for the convention on sunday

mercy killing is common in many chinese 
hospitals an official report said today 
the china daily said that one shanghai hospital reported 28 
percent of the 563 deaths in its medical surgical and gynecology 
departments in the past three years were the result of euthanasia 
incurably ill patients were allowed to die at the request of 
relatives who wanted to end the patients suffering it said 
the report said most cases of euthanasia in chinese hospitals 
were passive meaning the withholding of lifepreserving 
treatment to terminally ill patients 
mercy killing is not a sanctioned medical practice in china but 
recent polls have shown substantial popular acceptance 
the peoples daily reported last april that a survey of 283 
retired people in shanghai found more than half favored euthanasia 
for incurably ill patients

rock n roll stars perform in 
his honor archbishop desmond tutu calls him my leader 
publishing his picture is illegal in south africa but even 
toddlers chant his name 
nelson mandela who turns 70 on monday is arguably the worlds 
most influential prisoner although jailed since 1962 he is the 
most admired leader among south african blacks the embodiment of 
their quest for political freedom 
his birthday celebrated by protest marches and rock concerts 
overseas has reminded the government of the legions of people 
worldwide who want him released blacks spanning south africas 
ideological spectrum as well as many whites say no political 
breakthrough can occur while mandela is behind bars 
nothing the south african government can do will gain 
credibility while it treats dr mandela as a dangerous enemy 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi said in a recent speech black 
south africa will not rest until he is free 
buthelezi is a bitter foe of the african national congress the 
outlawed guerrilla movement mandela led from underground prior to 
his imprisonment but buthelezi like other blacks who oppose the 
ancs strategy of violence sets mandela apart and discusses him 
with deep respect 
president pw bothas government has considered the idea of 
freeing mandela and several times in recent years there were 
flurries of speculation that his freedom was imminent one such 
period came last november when authorities freed govan mbeki one 
of seven anc leaders sentenced along with mandela to life prison 
terms in 1964 for plotting a sabotage campaign aimed at 
overthrowing whiteminority rule 
the speculation was swiftly dampened when police imposed severe 
restrictions on mbeki since then government officials have 
indicated mandelas release is unlikely unless he publicly 
renounces violence a condition he rejects unless the anc is made 
legal and apartheid dismantled 
when convicted for sabotage mandela already had served two 
years in prison having received a fiveyear sentence in 1962 for 
incitement and leaving the country illegally 
he spent the first 18 years of his life sentence on robben 
island in cape towns table bay he was transferred in 1982 to 
pollsmoor prison in cape town where he is reported in good 
physical and mental health 
mandela reads uncensored newspapers and is expected to earn an 
advanced law degree later this year through correspondence courses 
he was a practicing lawyer before he went underground and has been 
awarded honorary doctorates from various universities during his 
imprisonment 
he reportedly has a spacious cell with access to a rooftop 
garden 
the government has given permission to mandelas family to have 
a sixhour reunion with him monday at pollsmoor by far the longest 
such meeting since he was jailed 
mandelas wife winnie has asked that the birthday be observed 
as a day of peace in line with the peaceful struggle we have 
always tried to maintain 
she has not commented publicly about the recent series of 
bombings of civilian targets in south africa attacks south 
african police officials blame on the anc 
dr nthato motlana an antiapartheid activist from soweto and 
an anc member before it was outlawed in 1960 said mandela seeks to 
avoid civilian casualties 
he resorted to a strategy of sabotage in 1961 because all 
other avenues were exhausted motlana said he is the one man 
who assuming he is willing could lead us out of this mess 
buthelezi also views mandela as a potential peacemaker as 
perhaps the only person capable of ending a bloody power struggle 
in natal province between militant anc supporters and more 
conservative blacks who follow buthelezi 
i believe he mandela would come out of jail to thump anybody 
who set black brother against black brother on the eve of a 
final victory over apartheid buthelezi said 
some south africans believe mandela causes more trouble for the 
government in jail than he would if freed some warn of a violent 
black backlash if he dies in prison 
the largest daily newspaper the star recently urged mandelas 
release on pragmatic grounds it said in an editorial 
should mandela die in prison he will be accorded universal 
political canonization and pretoria will attract even more censure 
once he is free the mandela myth would be cut down to size 
the world hears from mandela himself primarily through past 
statements which relatives and colleagues continue to quote 
in one such statement in 1985 he rejected bothas offer of 
conditional release 
i cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when i 
and you the people are not free he said in a statement read by 
his youngest daughter zinzi your freedom and mine cannot be 
separated i shall return

michael dukakis huddled at home with his closest adviser monday 
as time grew short to pick a democratic vice presidential running 
mate jesse jackson openly sought the nomination widely expected to 
go elsewhere saying if it was offered to me i would accept it 
vice president george bush said he might consider bob dole or 
another former republican rival as his partner when he picks a 
running mate next month 
dukakis met with paul brountas and then sent his longtime 
confidant to washington to meet with jackson runnerup in the 
primaries and widely regarded as unlikely to receive an offer to 
join the ticket 
jackson one of seven known candidates for the vice presidential 
nomination termed the session an oral interview andor exam on 
the topic he said he gave brountas his candid view as to the 
office of vice president and what i thought my qualifications 
might be 
he said it was selfevident he would like to be vice 
president 
but more likely candidates were sens bob graham of florida 
lloyd bentsen of texas john glenn of ohio albert gore jr of 
tennessee and reps richard gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton 
of indiana 
the increasingly delicate maneuvering came as a cbs newsnew 
york times poll found the massachusetts governor holding a 47 
percent to 39 percent lead over bush in a nationwide survey 
conducted last week 
democratic chairman paul kirk preached the gospel of party unity 
at a news conference in atlanta one week before the party 
nominating convention opens he said any disagreements over the 
partys barebones platform are gradually being worked out 
between the dukakis and jackson forces 
i dont expect there will be any socalled floor fights over 
the platform he said 
jackson adviser ron brown wasnt ready to go that far although 
he said the two sides are continuing to negotiate in an attempt to 
work out remaining differences there might be some very serious 
issues of principle that go to the floor of the convention he 
said in atlanta jackson supports calls for higher taxes on the 
wealthy and a fiveyear freeze in military spending dukakis 
opposes both 
the convention hall itself was a hardhat zone the television 
network skyboxes were in place but painters carpenters and 
electricians all worked to ready the omni for the invasion of 
democrats reporters and political junkies that will fill every 
available inch of space 
dukakis stayed mum on the subject on every democrats mind his 
choice of a political partner for the fall campaign have a good 
evening was all he said to reporters as he left his statehouse 
office at the end of the day 
but the signs pointed to a decision soon and the calendar 
dictated one an announcement was expected this week at least in 
part to allow dukakis and jackson supporters time to absorb the 
decision before their arrival in atlanta 
the governor spent part of the day at his statehouse office 
working on a massachusetts budget crunch and the balance of the 
day at home his aides said dukakis was mulling his choices he met 
during the morning with brountas and the two had a second 
latenight session after brountas returned from washington 
afterward brountas refused to say whether a running mate had been 
picked 
he hasnt made up his mind yet said one dukakis aide 
speaking on condition he not be identified by name or if he has 
he hasnt told anybody 
brountas flew to washington to meet with jackson regarded as 
too liberal and too controversial to get dukakis nod 
he joked about the subject at one point saying so far 
dukakis has not accepted my offer and i have not refused his 
but later jackson turned serious 
if i am not on the team then the governor must determine who 
the team members are and what role they will play jackson said 
before the session began 
he added certainly i am convinced that we have the challenge 
and the obligation to work together to win for the fall but beyond 
that we must establish a partnership of equity and shared 
responsibility 
bush took a jab at dukakis in a speech to farm editors and 
broadcasters that he billed as nonpartisan i am not the one who 
feels that the problems of agricultural america can be solved by 
planting more belgian endive he said poking fun at an offhand 
comment dukakis made in iowa last year 
bush who is waiting for dukakis to pick a running mate before 
he does offered praise of onetime primary foe bob dole and said 
he doesnt rule out any of the men who ran against him for the 
republican nomination 
the fact that you ran against somebody certainly in my view 
would not preclude consideration of that person the vice 
president told a meeting of agricultural editors writers and 
broadcasters in washington 
i will say this about bob dole he and i went head on head 
so did pat robertson and al haig and pete du pont and jack kemp 
my party has never been more unified going into a republican 
convention than we are right now thanks to the way bob dole and 
the others have been conducting themselves and their sense of 
advocacy 
the vice president said he would solicit advice from a variety 
of republican lawmakers and gop national committee members and 
then make a very personal decision 
but he said i just dont want to start going through long 
lists or short lists because believe me at this juncture we dont 
have them 
dukakis eightpoint lead in the cbsnew york times poll 
represented a small drop from a 10point edge in a similar survey 
in may in addition 28 percent of those polled expressed a 
favorable view of dukakis down from 38 percent in may twentyone 
percent expressed an unfavorable view up from 14 percent 
bushs favorable rating was 26 percent down from 33 percent 
and his unfavorable rating was 31 percent about the same as its 35 
percent in may

one of the best ways to get brokerage firms to 
combat insider trading is to make them pay when one of their 
employees gets caught says the top federal prosecutor of 
securities law violations 
its the only way were going to get institutions to start 
taking responsibility for individual behavior rudolph w 
giuliani us attorney in manhattan told a house panel on monday 
however giuliani and securities and exchange commission 
chairman david s ruder both cautioned that the law should exempt 
firms and supervisors that make a goodfaith effort to stop their 
employees from using nonpublic information to profit from trading 
in securities 
all of us are certainly sensitive to the fact that whenever 
anyone runs any institution large or small they can be victimized 
by the criminal activities of others said giuliani whose office 
has prosecuted a string of prominent wall street insider trading 
cases during the last two years 
meanwhile ruder said his agency is investigating the role of 
the firm that employed stephen wang jr accused two weeks ago in 
the secondbiggest insider trading case ever handled by the sec 
wang a 24yearold morgan stanley amp co analyst is accused of 
passing nonpublic information to fred c lee a hong kong 
businessman the 19 million in illegal profits they allegedly 
reaped is second only to the ivan boesky case 
we will be looking at whether morgan stanleys supervisory 
procedures were adequate and whether morgan stanley bears any 
fault ruder told reporters outside the hearing room 
if they were directly responsible for the activity we 
might consider including them as one of the parties to the action 
but i dont mean for a minute to suggest that we have any 
indication of that at all he said 
ruder and giuliani said a draft bill offered by rep edward j 
markey dmass chairman of the house energy and commerce finance 
subcommittee should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms 
would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees 
john w bachmann chairman of the securities industry 
association the trade group representing brokerages said firms 
and supervisors should be required to have policies designed to 
prevent insider trading but he said they should be held liable 
only when they actively aided a violation 
bachmann also sought to limit a provision that would allow the 
sec to pay bounties of up to 10 percent of any insidertrading 
penalty to informers who tip the agency off to a violation he said 
participants in an insider trading scheme should not be allowed to 
receive bounties 
ruder also expressed reservations saying juries may not believe 
witnesses who are paid to testify 
however giuliani said the internal revenue service has used 
bounties effectively to prosecute tax cheats although tipsters are 
sometimes peripherally involved in illegalities it is worth paying 
a reward when it results in a windfall for federal coffers he said 
its the only way in which you are going to bring this 
information forward he said 
markey said he intends to pass the bill out of his subcommittee 
in time for congressional action this year 
other provisions increase the fines for insider trading create 
a basis for private investors to sue inside traders and enhance the 
secs power to cooperate in investigations with foreign securities 
agencies

with hot water going for nearly 27 a gallon and 
potted plants renting for 7950 there is money to be made at next 
weeks democratic national convention 
the days when delegates pulled into town with a 10 bill and a 
clean shirt and left without changing either are history 
the 35000 visitors for the july 1821 event are expected to 
leave about 30 million in atlanta but some local plans to partake 
of the windfall have gone awry 
an employee of an atlanta office furniture and equipment rental 
firm told one caller his company and many others like it had raised 
prices 30 to 40 percent in anticipation of the convention rush 
so many news organizations and some democratic national 
committee groups flocked to a detroitarea firm willing to deliver 
install maintain and remove typewriters computers copiers 
telefax machines and office furniture at roughly half the going 
atlanta cost 
for example water coolers were quoted locally at 30 a day the 
detroit firm provides them at 30 a month 
some atlanta companies are renting typing tables at 50 each 
waste baskets for up to 27 and chairs for as much as 40 
convention florist service intl inc lists the rental price on 
7foot green plant at 7950 local florists checked by telephone 
offered to sell similar plants outright for from 45 to 65 
hotels are also looking at a boom with rooms for delegates 
reporters vips fundraisers lobbyists protesters and the 
curious at a premium 
a prospectus for a major textile convention coming to atlanta in 
september lists a single room at the atlanta hilton at 102 a 
reservations clerk quoted a rate of 135 for the democratic 
convention 
a spot check found some hotels charging higher rates although 
some quoted rates at or below the rate being charged at the 
september textile convention 
many of the receptions news conferences and hospitality rooms 
scheduled for the convention will be held at the georgia world 
congress center home base for most of the 12000 news media 
representatives plus the party faithful who cannot fit into the 
convention hall 
mgr inc the food service contractor for all events there will 
cater about 950 convention functions over four days from small 
hospitality suites to a windup victory party for 30000 
mgr president phillip noyes said the company is hiring about 500 
extra employees to handle the rush however the prices have been 
in effect for a year 
we arent the cheapest in the country he acknowledged we 
provide a highly specialized service and people pay for that our 
business isnt any different people want a product thats iced 
down chilled and ready and all that goes with it 
last year a poll of 500 trade shows and conventions picked mgr 
as the best convention catering firm in the country 
mgr will provide soft drinks at about 43 a case most meals 
will be served buffetstyle with lunch at 1450 and dinner at 
1850 
coffee or hot water to make tea or instant coffee is about 27 
a gallon after tax and a 17 percent service charge are added fruit 
juice will be about 29 a gallon convention tenants are barred 
from having their own coffee makers 
theyre charging 165 for 100 little pieces of chicken 
everybody is complaining said jesse jackson aide yolanda 
carroway 
prices have not been raised at all said tim sterns who 
oversees convention catering for the democratic national committee 
he said dnc surveys showed the prices to be lower than those at 
many downtown hotels 
they have been very accommodating he said when asked about 
the price of mgrs coffee service they put in a program where 
the initial service is 50 and they provide a coffee maker each 
day they will deliver supplies at a lower rate for people who want 
to make their own coffee they have made some concessions in that 
way 
delegates may get a break however if they come down with 
toothaches an atlanta dentist edward j mills is offering free 
emergency dental service to delegates during the convention

disease demands and my work for the people said duarte the 
western hemisphere staunchest us ally

chief executive and other officials on the tarmac of ilopango 
airport outside the capital

crisis of its 28year history each of two bitterly feuding 
factions has nominated a presidential candidate

routine will be established according to the evolution of his 
disease

president reagan has promised to weigh 
opposition to a proposed executive order that could help license 
the seabrook nh nuclear power plant by circumventing the 
objections of massachusetts gov michael s dukakis 
lawmakers from the allrepublican new hampshire congressional 
delegation upset over the proposed federal intervention said they 
received the pledge monday after a white house briefing with reagan 
we found the president very positive very sympathetic very 
understanding said sen warren rudman rnh it was clear to 
all of us that the president was going to very actively consider 
our request that this order never be published 
rudman and sen gordon humphrey rnh expressed optimism that 
the president may reject the proposal 
i am very hopeful that this visit has an effect on the 
president in convincing him that the process was working and the 
federal government need not become involved at this time rudman 
told reporters outside the white house 
humphrey added the president didnt say yes or no but i came 
away more encouraged about our prospects of blocking this order 
than frankly i had expected to 
but rep judd gregg rnh who said before the briefing that 
he thought it would be extremely difficult to derail the proposal 
said afterwards that he felt no more optimistic about the 
lawmakers chances 
he gave us no reading at all as to what his decision would 
be said gregg noting that reagan reiterated his strong support 
for atomic power and expressed concern over state governments 
ability to block reactor licenses 
the president has not made a decision said rep robert 
smith rnh he will weigh our evidence and our advice thats 
the best we can hope for at this time 
the four lawmakers loyal and longtime allies of the reagan 
administration have expressed support for plant licensing as long 
as federal regulators determine that the plant and evacuation plan 
are safe 
licensing for the seabrook reactor has been stalled largely by 
the refusal of dukakis to submit evacuation plans for the six 
massachusetts communities that fall within the plants 10mile 
emergency zone 
the proposed executive order would give the federal emergency 
management agency which has served a strictly advisory role in 
atomic safety issues the power to design and implement evacuation 
plans when local governments refuse to do so 
the four were infuriated last month when they learned of the 
proposal through plant opponents who discovered a draft and leaked 
it to reporters 
reagan told the delegation that he had not seen any draft of the 
proposal which sources said was initiated by the energy 
department pushed by four senators and approved unanimously by the 
presidents domestic policy council 
dukakis and other plant opponents have said it is impossible to 
evacuate the area quickly and safely because of narrow rural roads 
and a large summertime population

state troopers patrolled city streets monday 
to make up for an apparent sickout by more than 300 officers upset 
over low wages and the lack of a labor contract the job action 
ended at late evening 
police chief warren woodfork said city streets were probably 
safer than usual because of the 60 troopers in the city there were 
143 officers and troopers on patrol compared with a usual 83 
police said 
officers began straggling back to work for the start of their 
lateevening shift said police department spokesman john bryson 
they have returned to work were back up to normal strength 
he said 
woodfork said his department could continue to maintain security 
in the city of 500000 even if police union members carry out a 
threat to stop work during next months republican national 
convention 
about 130 troopers already are scheduled to be in new orleans 
next month during the gop convention 
the sickout began sunday night and woodfork said he didnt know 
how long it would last although he heard it was to end monday 
night 
leaders of the police association of new orleans have long been 
pressuring mayor sidney barthelemy to enter the citys first 
collective bargaining agreement with the union the union claims a 
membership of about 900 of the 1100member police force 
barthelemy who was out of town monday and unavailable for 
comment has refused to recognize pano as a collective bargaining 
group 
union president ron cannatella did not return telephone calls 
and there was no word from the union on whether it had called for 
the sickout 
woodfork said he had no immediate plans to discipline officers 
who called in sick sunday or monday 
i would just ask the officers who are out sick to search their 
consciences dont hold the city of new orleans hostage he said

in 1984 there was great handwringing over the 
networks decision to drop gaveltogavel coverage of the national 
conventions in favor of roughly two hours of live primetime 
coverage a night 
in 1988 the question thats starting to be asked is whether two 
hours of primetime coverage a night is too much 
former nbc news president reuven frank who has attended seven 
conventions as a network producer saw the end of gaveltogavel 
coverage and expects this year to watch the last primetime 
coverage 
conventions are now being held by the two major parties only 
because theres television frank said thats the only 
justification for the convention at all there is no journalistic 
reason for our being there i think we ought to be there i dont 
think we ought to carry it live 
theres nothing going to happen that you dont know now 
sitting here but we dont know how to stop its like the old man 
and the sea 
next week when the democrats meet in atlanta they are certain 
to nominate massachusetts gov michael dukakis the only major 
questions remaining are who his running mate will be and what jesse 
jackson the runnerup will do or say 
mediawise political parties know that primetime bickering 
turns off voters so conventions have become little more than 
primetime commercials a onetime major network event the 
conventions are becoming a madeforcable show 
complete coverage will be available on cspan and the cable news 
network a trend that will no doubt allow the three major networks 
to say by 1992 that cable tv provides sufficient coverage to meet 
the public need and the networks no longer need devote live prime 
time to the proceedings indeed they are already beginning to say 
that 
our responsibility as a news organization has changed 
somewhat said nbc producer anne binford in the past we felt 
we had to provide coverage of the entire convention but now with 
cable and cspan and cnn the viewers can watch the coverage from 
many different sources were now trying to bring the audience a 
condensed version of the important events of the night 
all three networks say their coverage plans are flexible 
depending on events but the intention is to go on the air from 
911 pm edt each of the four nights cbs plans to start at 8 pm 
on thursday 
cspan will carry each session of the convention live in its 
entirety without commentary or interviews 
cnn plans to carry convention updates throughout the day the 
convention session in its entirety followed by a halfhour wrapup 
then crossfire and inside politics 88 the most devout 
political junkies can even catch convention highlights from 46 am 
jeff gralnick abcs executive producer of special broadcasts 
wishes the networks could justify such extensive coverage 
i think theres a hell of a vibrant political story at the 
conventions he said im a political junkie and i just find 
what the democrats are doing and later the republicans a 
fascinating political dynamic 
but he concedes the conventions are not a massaudience 
program 
for the sake of the union i wish they were but if you look 
at the number of people who choose to vote out of the universe of 
people who can vote you begin to get an answer of why people dont 
watch political conventions if they dont care to vote they 
certainly arent going to watch the end product of the voting 
cnn stands to become the star of the democrats convention it 
has anchor power in mary alice williams and bernard shaw and with 
the networks paring down their staffs for budgetary considerations 
the cable network is in their league cnn will have 275 staffers 
compared to the 300350 each for the bigger networks in addition 
cnn is based in atlanta and has a homefield advantage 
the three networks are taking 2550 percent fewer staffers to 
this years conventions than they did in 1984 
id be lying if i said it wasnt a matter of budget but more 
its a matter of each time you do one of these things you learn 
how to do them a little more efficiently said gralnick 
its new times said binford i think with the new 
technology were able to cover it just as efficiently 
frank himself an innovator of much of the presentday 
convention coverage such as anchor booths overlooking the 
convention floor agrees that the networks have learned a lot 
but he adds now that we know how to cover it theres 
nothing to cover

the united states should raise gasoline taxes 
by 50 cents a gallon require cars to get 45 miles per gallon and 
boost the gasguzzler tax to raise money for rebates to buyers of 
fuelefficient cars an organization of environmentalists 
scientists and business executives said today 
those were central measures in a program outlined by the 
american council for an energyefficient economy that would set a 
national goal of maintaining momentum in improving energy 
efficiency for the rest of the century 
energy efficiency does not require sacrifice the group 
argued in its report we do not advocate saving energy as an end 
in itself it makes sense only when saving energy costs less than 
providing energy including environmental damage and security risks 
in the comparison 
environmental risks of inefficiency are severe the group said 
manmade gases notably carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels 
threaten to warm the earth by as much as eight degrees fahrenheit 
in the next century raising sea levels and drastically changing 
patterns of rainfall and drought a process some scientists say is 
under way 
increasing the 9centpergallon federal gasoline tax by 10 
cents annually for five years three years if crude oil prices 
double would yield 40 billion to 60 billion a year 
such a tax would help make sure consumers are given a price 
signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and 
encourages conservation some money could be rebated to the poor 
through income tax provisions 
cars now required to get 26 mpg should get 45 mpg by 2000 
it need not be so that the standards would mean less safety 
from lighter weight if cars are carefully designed the group said 
cars twice as efficient as current models would cost 200 to 
800 more the group estimated the increase would be recouped over 
the life of the car through lower cost of operation 
a stiffer gasguzzler tax which can reach more than 2000 
now but generally applies to only a few luxury cars like jaguar 
would discourage production of highly inefficient cars and provide 
funds more than 11 billion a year in 1994 to encourage 
purchase of gas sippers 
the rebate could be on the order of 1000 for models with 
mileage 50 percent better than todays best implying rebates for 
cars getting about 75 mpg 
energy used per dollar of economic activity declined at a rate 
of about 27 percent per year from 1976 through 1986 and was still 
declining at a 25 percent per year during the economic recovery of 
1983 through 1986 
the 1986 oil price collapse discouraged further gains and the 
decline was only 05 percent in 1987 the energy department says it 
expects gains of about 09 percent a year for the rest of the 
century 
a reasonable international goal would be annual reductions of 2 
percent and we suggest that the united states set an example by 
pursuing a goal of at least 25 percent per year until 2000 the 
group said

promoting the memory and ideals of civil 
rights leaders such as medgar evers may help black youth steer 
clear of crime and drugs says evers widow myrlie 
it is so important that we remember our leaders who have 
passed and those who are with us now and that our young people 
know who they are and the contributions that they have made mrs 
evers said upon acceptance of the naacps first chairman civil 
rights leadership award in behalf of her husband 
in so knowing they will have something to aspire to she 
said they will not as readily go into black on black crime or 
into drugs but there will be a sense of wellbeing a sense of 
going forward that is what medgar stood for 
i am so grateful that medger is being remembered by the 
organization that he loved so much and the organization that no one 
could take him away from mrs evers told the 79th annual 
convention of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people 
evers who led the fight against segregation as the naacps 
mississippi state field secretary from 1954 to 1963 received 
national attention as the man who counseled james meredith through 
his successful bid to enter the university of mississippi in 1962 
mrs evers currently the los angeles city commissioner of 
public works told the associated press about the day her husband 
was gunneddown in front of their home in jackson 
i was in the kitchen with the children as he entered the 
driveway the children said theres daddys as he opened the car 
door the shot rang out the children fell to the floor as he had 
taught them and i bolted for the door thinking oh god dont 
let him be hit 
evers had been fatally wounded with a shot from a high powered 
rifle the kind they used to kill large animals like deer she 
said a member of the white citizens council was charged and tried 
twice by an allwhite jury which was unable to reach a verdict 
mrs evers admitted she always felt he never got the 
recognition for the work he had done and i wanted so badly for 
people to know about him and his work and his organization 
the naacp is doing that 
keeping his memory alive was something he and i had discussed 
before his death she said we both knew that something was 
coming and tried to prepare ourselves and each other for the 
inevitable and the last two weeks of his life we stopped denying 
that something would not happen something that we knew was 
going to happen 
he told me myrlie dont worry about people remembering me 
at some point in history my deeds will speak for themselves 
once i told him he wasnt getting enough publicity and he 
said i dont want publicity im in it for the people it doesnt 
make any difference to me

by agreeing to pay the government more than 282000 
donald l sturm 56 signed a consent agreement without 
admitting guilt settling a civil insider trading lawsuit filed by 
the securities and exchange commission

in trading profits the sec contended 
the sec did not allege that sturm made any money on the

stock purchases 
its as if sturm actually made the profits and gave it to the 
friend although he sturm didnt buy the stock said jerry a 
isenberg an sec official in washington 
isenberg said sturm not his friend was charged because sturm 
was involved in initiating the trade he financed the trade

wrong i have nonetheless chosen to settle this matter rather than 
to dispute it any further 
the sec did not identify sturms bank the relative who tipped 
him off or the relatives investment bank

democratic party chief paul kirk says if there 
are debates on the party platform at next weeks convention the 
arguments wont be bitter ones 
kirk suggested monday that backers of michael dukakis the 
certain nominee were resolving differences with the jesse jackson 
camp on about a dozen platform planks 
jacksons convention manager ron brown however left open the 
possibility of floor disputes 
we want more specificity in the platform and were moving in 
that direction in the discussions brown said there might be 
some very serious issues of principle that go to the floor of the 
convention 
kirk played down that prospect 
i dont expect there will be any socalled floor fights on the 
platform there may be differences of opinion there may be 
agreements to disagree all the indications that i have are 
whatever differences had existed they are gradually being worked 
out he said 
i dont expect that anything related to the platform will 
distract from the unity that has been built up in the past year 
he added he said he did not expect any prolonged or protracted 
or acrimonious debate 
kirk on monday released a partial list of the speakers for the 
four convention sessions starting in seven days and said jackson 
had agreed to the convention schedule 
the schedule still without times without all speakers included 
has a major focus tuesday night on jackson and the platform 
kirk said any platform debate would take place late tuesday 
afternoon before prime time and before jackson and sen edward 
kennedy are scheduled to speak 
one concession to jackson involved the people who will actually 
read planks of the platform to the convention and to the nation in 
prime time 
michigan gov james blanchard platform chairman will introduce 
the document then jackson supporters rep bill gray of 
pennsylvania and texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower will 
read portions of it

drought could have some impact on the nations 
rice crop this year but not in the way heat and dry weather have 
shriveled corn and soybean prospects according to agriculture 
department analysts 
the us rice harvest is all from irrigated land says nathan 
childs of the departments economic research service but that 
doesnt necessarily mean rice is drought proof 
much will depend on how the heat affects rice plants and on 
irrigation practices including reduced yields from rising water 
costs he said monday 
but generally the drought is not expected to chew deeply into 
rice this year at least not like youre seeing in the other 
commodities childs said 
according to usda projections as of june 9 the us rice 
harvest this year could be around 157 million hundredweight up 
nearly a fourth from 1277 million in 1987 
total rice use also is growing says the departments economic 
research service in its latest outlook report and this growth is 
expected to continue in 198889 overall rice demand has increased 
by 20 million hundredweight in the last four years 
greater consumer preference for grainbased foods aggressive 
marketing by rice industry organizations and processors and wider 
availability of easytoprepare rice products have helped raise 
consumption the report said growth in the asian and hispanic 
segment of the us population and increasing popularity of spanish 
and oriental foods among all americans have also helped expand 
consumption 
another growth has been in the amount of rice used to make beer 
an estimated 17 million hundredweight this year up from less 
than 14 million in 198485 
brewers use makes up about 20 percent of total domestic 
consumption and continues to show yeartoyear increases the 
report said anheuserbusch the largest us brewery uses rice 
exclusively s an adjunct in several of its products gains in 
market share by this company over the past several years have 
helped increase rice use in beer even though growth in total beer 
consumption has slowed 
in all domestic rice use may be about 835 million 
hundredweight in 198889 up from 808 million in 198788 and 763 
million in 198687 
rice exports are forecast at 77 million hundredweight up from 
70 million last year but down from 854 million in 198687 
assuming normal weather in major rice exporting countries 
export competition likely will be intense the report said 
expectations of smaller rice supplies in 198788 triggered rice 
price increases and in early 1988 us cash prices were 
substantially higher than world prices however those eased when 
major importers spurned the higherpriced us rice 
also expectations of increased exports from thailand further 
weakened world prices the report added assuming normal 
weather world production will increased in 198889 and keep prices 
below the level of 198788 
for us producers rice prices may be in the range of 5 to 7 
per hundredweight down from 7 to 725 in 198788 but above the 
average of 375 in 198687 the report said

a recent survey by the american association of 
crop insurers shows that more than 370000 farmers bought 
multipleperil crop insurance this year a 19 percent increase from 
1987 
considering that most of these producers acted before there 
was evidence of a drought indicates that the crop insurance program 
is taking hold in the farm country as a riskmanagement tool 
said e eugene gantz executive vice president of the association 
the signup deadline in most areas was april 15 well before the 
severe drought conditions set in he said 
gantz said preliminary estimates show 65 million to 70 million 
acres will likely be protected by crop insurance this year 
compared with 62 million in 1987 the face value of protection of 
insurance written in 1987 was more than 6 billion and probably 
will increase this year he said 
these are producers who didnt want to wait for the federal 
government to come along with a handout gantz said in his 
report they acted in a businesslike manner to protect their own 
farms and their own families from possible disaster 
the multipleperil crop insurance program began seven years ago 
and includes commercial companies that are reinsured against 
catastrophic losses by the federal crop insurance program an 
agency of the agriculture department the fcic also handles 
insurance directly through master marketers who account for about 
20 percent of the total 
gantz said the fcic has indicated there will be no program 
changes in 1989 for most crops beginning with those that will be 
planted this fall

on sovietpolish relations 
there is still much in sovietpolish relations that does not 
meet the needs of both sides 
this applies to direct human contacts as well new crossings 
will be set up on the sovietpolish border the possibilities of 
contacts across the border will be expanded and more railway and 
air lines will connect our countries the idea of establishing a 
ferry between szscecin and leningrad is being discussed 
our joint history is a rich fullblooded history of two 
neighboring peoples we have causes for pride but there are 
things that have to be revealed and shown more fully 
this history also has its complexities what is called blank 
spots notions that are based more on emotions rather than on 
strict scientific knowledge form at times around them 
there is only one road to the truth here study of facts calm 
comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions 
history cannot be replayed but lessons can and should be drawn

on the eastwest ideology battle 
it is very important in these conditions to clear the 
ideological struggle of foul play psychological warfare and 
cultivation of mistrust among nations are incompatible with the 
norms of civilized statetostate contacts 
it is essential to do away with the preaching of militarism 
hatred and enmity so that differences between countries become a 
stimulus for cooperation rather than a hindrance to it 
the nations need the truth about one another western society 
has a poor knowledge of realities in the socialist world it has 
been hammered into peoples heads there since they were in diapers 
that the communists are the bad guys who have enslaved their 
peoples and are sharpening their knives against the free nations of 
the west 
we have to abandon our own simplistic approaches in presenting 
western realities as well 
it is imperative to see all the diversity the complexity and 
equivocality the contradictoriness of what is happening in western 
countries in economic political social and other spheres

on conventional arms 
as far as the governments of nato countries are concerned they 
traditionally look at conventional arms as a legitimate component 
of power politics and uphold the nuclear deterence concept while 
paying lip service to the need to reduce conventional arms they 
continue in fact building up their military resources 
we would for instance be prepared to withdraw our matching 
aircraft from forwarddeployment sites in eastern europe if nato 
agrees not to base its 72 f16 fighterbombers rejected by spain 
in italy 
the time has come for deeper troops and arms cuts in europe and 
this requires expediting work in vienna to hammer out a mandate for 
opening negotiations both on the reduction of conventional forces 
and armaments and on confidencebuilding measures on a europewide 
scale 
we suggest effecting the cuts in three phases 
at the first phase all the imbalances and asymmetries between 
nato and the warsaw treaty as regards both troop strength and 
primary arms are to be identified and eliminated this approach 
could be applied both to the entire european continent as a whole 
and to its individual regions for example central europe southern 
europe etc 
for identifying the imbalances and asymmetries we suggest 
exchanging initial data even before the talks or simultaneously 
with their commencement in amounts to be dictated by the agreed 
subject of the negotiations 
careful checks on the data including onsite inspections are 
to be run soon after the start of the talks so as to avoid a 
repetition of the sad experience of the debates on numbers that 
once deadlocked the vienna talks on central europe 
let me note in passing that if nato shows readiness we can 
discuss the issue of the imbalances and asymmetries even before the 
start of the formal talks in connection with the exchanges of data 
on troops and weaponry 
at the second phase the nato and warsaw treaty forces are to be 
reduced by 500000 men on each side from the levels existing after 
the elimination of the imbalances and asymmetries the cuts are to 
be carried out by disbanding military units along with elimination 
of their organic arms 
at the third phase the cuts are to be continued so as to 
finally lend the military units of both military alliances a purely 
defensive nature 
all the reduction phases would provide for effective 
verificaiton arrangements including onsite inspections 
i would like to add to this that we are prepared not only at the 
third phase but also from the very start of the cuts to come to 
terms on the priority reduction of tactical nuclear weapons 
tactical strike aircraft and tanks

bears deer skunks and other creatures that 
usually prefer to stay far from humans are being driven by the 
drought to unaccustomed boldness in their search for food and water 
so far this year 30 bears have been spotted from reno to lake 
tahoe in western nevada compared with the normal three to five 
annually and there has been a virtual invasion of skunks in 
residential areas wildlife officials said monday 
anything thats green looks good to them said gilbert 
marrugo the state director of animal damage control the best 
thing to do is not feed them because theyll come back for more 
marrugo said the renosparks area and neighboring counties are 
seeing a huge increase in the number of rabbits and skunks near 
rural homes although exact numbers are unavailable since many 
encounters arent reported 
theres an explosion of rabbits in the area this year 
marrugo said weve already had five or six complaints of damage 
theyve caused in flower beds or hay fields not a lot but the 
summers just beginning a pack of them can ruin 25 acres 
skunks also are showing up in record numbers particularly in 
the valleys north of reno and in verdi to the west marrugo said 
one woman in verdi has trapped 29 skunks under her house in 
the past two years he said its a virtual invasion in some 
areas 
gregg tanner a supervising game biologist for the nevada 
department of wildlife said big game and small animals are 
migrating in search of new water supplies and range land because 
backtoback dry years have decreased forage and stream flows 
they concentrate around any free water source they find he 
said 
already this year more than 30 black bears have been sighted 
looking for food among humans mostly around the lake tahoe basin 
area he said in a normal year the state wildlife department 
receives reports of three to five sightings 
i think you can attribute this to the drought year tanner 
said their normal food supply has been impacted so theyre 
looking through the garbage for food 
there have been no confrontations with humans since the 
bears usually are scared off tanner said but any time you get 
urban dwellers directly in contact with a bear theres a lot of 
well concerned folks 
a mild winter spared most of the states mule deer leaving a 
10year high of 250000 of the longeared blacktailed creatures 
competing for scarce forage and water tanner said now those deer 
along with bighorn sheep and antelopes are migrating toward farms 
ranches and other rural residences in search of food and water 
during the summer months it will only get worse tanner 
said i expect a difficult fall having to deal with all the 
problems to stop the depredation 
shriveling wetlands in the western nevada valleys normally fed 
by winter snowmelt are another peril of the drought tanner said 
small dieoffs of fish and waterfowl already have occurred he 
said and more are expected 
its too early to count our losses yet he said we just 
have to take the lumps when they come

episcopal church leaders have closed their 69th 
general convention without adopting a proposal that could have 
encouraged the ordination of homosexuals 
a resolution monday expanding access to the selection process 
for ordination for all persons including homosexuals but 
refusing to recognize a right to ordination for all fell one vote 
short of passage in the churchs house of deputies 
the 900member house of deputies divided between lay and 
clerical church members and the 200member house of bishops 
establish policy for the 27 millionmember church whose 10day 
convention ended monday the conventions are held every three years 
delegates considered almost 500 resolutions at the convention 
which opened july 2 but the question of ordaining gay priests 
dominated the final days of the convention 
current church law says candidates for ordination must be at 
least 21 years of age and pass prescribed medical psychological 
and academic tests but leaders of some of the churchs 118 
dioceses in the united states have ordained homosexual priests 
without running afoul of episcopal canon law 
in 1979 the 66th general convention approved a resolution 
stating in part we believe it is not appropriate for this church 
to ordain a practicing homosexual 
that resolution however is not a part of canon law which 
draws a distinction between homosexual activity which it says is 
sinful and homosexual orientation which it says is not 
church leaders on both sides of the homosexual debate agreed 
that mondays vote left the issue unresolved 
canon law was left intact and thus maintained discretion within 
the dioceses as to consideration of homosexual candidates for the 
priesthood said the rt rev paul moore jr bishop of new york 
city 
im not unhappy that it didnt pass said the rt rev 
george n hunt bishop of rhode island we are not of one mind on 
the subject until we are we should be cautious of passing 
anything until we can speak with authority 
i was disappointed that to the portion of people who tend to 
see themselves as being disenfranchised from the church approval 
of the resolution would have given some pastoral concern said 
the rt rev okelley whitaker bishop of central new york 
but whitaker added it doesnt cripple the church 
homosexuals are involved in the ordination process in many dioceses 
already it is happening anyway 
confusion over parliamentary procedure marred the homosexual 
debate church leaders said 
ive been a bishop a long time and i have never heard as 
many parliamentary procedure tactics as i have seen in this house 
this week presiding bishop edward browning told the house of 
bishops 
also monday both houses approved a resolution opposing 
abortion as a means of birth control family planning or sex 
selection 
the resolution in its final form acknowledged that women in the 
united states have a legal right to medically safe abortion but it 
also deleted a passage expressing the churchs opposition to any 
government action barring a womans right to abortion 
delegates on monday also approved a resolution extending for two 
years the experimental use oelief and practice curtail masculine 
references to god as much as possible the churchs liturgical 
commission later will evaluate the experiment 
among the final resolutions approved was one calling frrowly 
rejected the resolution sunday when some delegates claimed the 
boycott would hurt us businesses but the deputies reversed their 
vote monday to express solidarity with anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu of south africa who has promoted the boycott as a means of 
protesting racial segregation in that nation

the black box recorders from the downed 
iranian jetliner in the persian gulf should be recoverable 
clearing up questions about the planes flight path and whether its 
pilots received radio warnings us aviation experts say 
several us aviation experts speaking monday on condition that 
they not be identified by name speculated that the recorders 
likely survived the crash unless the missile from the uss vincennes 
hit directly where they were located in the rear of the aircraft 
and although the commander of the iranian navy denied the 
recorders had been found a published report from dubai in the 
united arab emirates quoted unidentified salvage experts as saying 
that the socalled black boxes had been recovered from the gulf 
waters 
all commercial jetliners are required to have the recorders one 
that monitors cockpit conversation and another that tracks 
operations of the plane 
they are housed in separate boxes that actually are painted 
orange but often become blackened by fire in airline crashes they 
are located in the tail section of the plane and designed to 
withstand severe impacts 
the iran air airbus a300 shot down by the vincennes on july 3 
killing all 290 people aboard was believed to have been equipped 
with a sophisticated digital flight recorder that would provide a 
broad range of operating information as well as a cockpit voice 
recorder 
if they are found in good condition and were properly maintained 
by the iranians the recorders could provide a wealth of 
information to investigators including a detailed reproduction of 
the planes flight path from the time of takeoff the experts said 
the cockpit voice recorder which monitors radio communications 
and cockpit conversation on a continuous 30minute loop would 
indicate whether the iran air pilots received repeated radio 
warnings as maintained by the pentagon 
the cockpit tape would be expected to cover the entire flight of 
the iranian jetliner as well as the period during which the plane 
was taxiing and awaiting takeoff at bandar abbas in iran for the 
short trip across the gulf to dubai 
in addition to radio communications the cockpit tape would 
reveal conversation within the cockpit and indicate whether the 
pilots might have intended anything other than a routine flight and 
whether they might have been distracted by mechanical or other 
problems causing them to fly off course or fail to acknowledge 
radio warnings the experts suggested 
the flight data recorder in the a300 is a sophisticated digital 
version that provides more than 80 measures involving the planes 
flight operations including altitude heading air speed and 
whether the plane was experiencing any flight difficulties 
the pentagon has said that the commercial jetliner was perceived 
in part as a threat to the vincennes because of the planes unusual 
flight path and speed officials said the jetliner was descending 
traveling faster than normal for a commercial airliner and heading 
directly toward the us ship there also have been discrepancies 
as to how far the a300 was off from its intended flight path

part of a deposition by attorney general edwin 
meese iii gives conflicting indications of whether he knew about 
planned payments to the israeli labor party in 1985 
meese attorney james rocap on monday released a 12page portion 
of the deposition given to the office of independent counsel james 
c mckay the deposition was the focus of news reports over the 
weekend that meese gave differing recollections between november 
1987 and february about planned payments to the israeli party 
the planned payments could have constituted a violation of the 
foreign corrupt practices act 
in the deposition meese was asked by mckays office whether he 
understood that the israeli government and the labor party were to 
receive funds from the pipeline 
meese referring to a 1985 memo he received from longtime friend 
e robert wallach about the planned labor party payments said i 
cant recall specifically but that certainly would be consistent 
with my understanding and would explain why mr thenisraeli prime 
minister and labor party chief shimon peres was personally 
interested 
meese was then asked whether he had any specific recollection of 
wallach telling him of the labor partys interest or financial 
stake in the operation 
i have a general recollection but even as we sit here now i 
dont know how that was all going to be achieved meese replied 
pressed to elaborate meese said i have a general 
recollection that the labor party was very much interested he 
added that he couldnt recall except through the words of wallachs 
memo in front of him which is consistent with my recollection 
then for the ensuing 10 pages of the deposition meese says 
that peres didnt make any reference to the labor partys stake in 
the pipeline in a conversation the two men had that meese never 
discussed with wallach where the pipeline money would go and that 
he never discussed with wallach the propriety of the labor party 
receiving any funds 
later in the deposition meese also said that as to an israeli 
stake and labor party stake in the project i have no even 
general recollection of the benefit to the labor party other than 
as is expressed in that memorandum that you showed me 
finally after 12 pages of questioning about the planned labor 
party payments meese suggested he hadnt focused on the portion of 
the memo from wallach relating to planned payments to the labor 
party until he was questioned that day 
after news media reports surfaced early this year about the 
wallach memos reference to planned labor party payments meese 
said publicly that he didnt recall reading that portion of 
wallachs memo relating to any such plan 
the lawyer james rocap said meese filed a declaration with 
mckays office after reporters suggested that meeses public 
statement didnt square with his earlier deposition rocap said 
information about the deposition apparently had been leaked to 
reporters 
i was not stating that i had a recollection specific or 
general that the labor party had a financial stake in the 
project the feb 18 1988 declaration said 
the new york times which on saturday published portions of 
independent counsel mckays 830page report on the meese 
investigation said mckay concluded that the memo was the only 
direct evidence of a bribery plan and therefore insufficient to 
conclude that meese violated the law

here is the statement by white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater regarding compensation for the families of victims 
in the iranian airliner shooting 
the president has reviewed us policy in the persian gulf where 
our military forces are protecting vital interests of the free 
world he has expressed his complete satisfaction with the policy 
and reiterated his belief that the actions of the uss vincennes on 
july 3 in the case of the iranian airliner were justifiable 
defensive actions 
at the same time he remains personally saddened at the tragic 
death of the innocent victims of this accident and has already 
expressed his deep regret to their families 
prompted by the humanitarian traditions of our nation the 
president has decided that the united states will offer 
compensation on an ex gratia basis to the families of the victims 
who died in the iranian airliner incident details concerning 
amounts timing and other matters remain to be worked out 
it should be clearly understood that payment will go to the 
families not governments and will be subject to the normal us 
legal requirements including if necessary appropriate action by 
congress 
in the case of iran arrangements will be made through 
appropriate third parties this offer of ex gratia compensation is 
consistent with international practice and is a humanitarian effort 
to ease the hardship of the families it is offered on a voluntary 
basis not on the basis of any legal liability or obligation 
the responsibility for this tragic incident and for the deaths 
of hundreds of thousands of other innocent victims as a result of 
the iraniraq war lies with those who refuse to end the conflict 
a particularly heavy burden of responsibility rests with the 
government of iran which has refused for almost a year to accept 
and implement security council resolution 598 while it continues 
unprovoked attacks on innocent neutral shipping and crews in the 
international waters of the gulf 
in fact at the time of the iran air incident us forces were 
militarily engaged with iranian forces as a result of the latters 
unprovoked attacks upon neutral ships and a us navy helicopter 
the urgent necessity to end this conflict is reinforced by the 
dangers it poses to neighboring countries and the deplorable 
precedent of the increasingly frequent use of chemical weapons by 
both sides causing still more casualties 
only an end to the war an objective we desire can halt the 
immense suffering in the region and put an end to innocent loss of 
life our goal is peace in the gulf and on land we urge iran and 
iraq to work with the security council for an urgent comprehensive 
settlement of the war pursuant to resolution 598 meanwhile united 
states forces will continue their mission in the area keenly aware 
of the risks involved and ready to face them

two former royal jordanian airlines employees 
are in federal protective custody to testify against a suspected 
lebanese terrorist charged with leading the hijacking of their 
plane in 1985 
the two unidentified members of the jetliners flight crew 
entered the federal witness protection program after agreeing to 
testify at the trial of fawaz younis a prosecutor said monday at a 
pretrial hearing in the case 
younis a former member of lebanons shiite amal militia is 
charged with leading a group of five men who stormed the boeing 727 
with ak47 assult rifles at beirut international airport on june 
11 1985 
assistant us attorney ramsey johnson said the former airline 
employees were uprooted from their homes in the middle east and 
entered the us protection program after their decision to 
testify in the trial 
johnson said fbi agents are still trying to locate an 
arabspeaking passenger who identified younis at a courtordered 
lineup last march we believe he is an excellent witness the 
prosecutor told us district judge barrington d parker 
younis was arrested last september after he and a friend jamal 
hamdan went aboard an fbichartered yacht in international waters 
off the coast of cyprus 
hamdan who cooperated with the fbi in luring younis to the 
yacht with the prospect of making a drug deal is also in 
protective custody johnson said 
no date has been set for the trial 
a federal appeals court is considering whether statements younis 
made to fbi agents during four days of interrogation aboard a navy 
ship in the mediterranean can be admitted into evidence 
prosecutors appealed parkers ruling in february that younis 
confession was illegally obtained because he didnt understand his 
right to remain silent 
parker ruled that younis was unable to make a responsible 
decision because of his unfamiliarity with the us legal system 
the judge also noted that during his interrogation younis was 
seasick and suffered pain in his wrists which were broken when two 
fbi agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht 
at mondays hearing parker said he had found a classified 
document that contradicted a previous assertion by johnson that the 
fbi had never considered placing an attorney aboard the ship to 
advise younis 
johnson had told the judge in february that the idea just 
didnt come up 
parker indicating the secret document he had examined 
contradicted that answer told johnson you are charged with the 
knowledge of the information contained in the secret documents 
turned over to the court 
on june 30 the us circuit court of appeals here ordered 
parker to conduct a hearing on whether to admit the document into 
evidence 
the appeals court said the document raises questions that go 
directly to younis claim he was denied a right to counsel during 
his interrogation 
the judge gave johnson 48 hours to consult government agencies 
about declassifying the document and scheduled a hearing for next 
monday

department store collapsed in a thunderstorm have filed lawsuits 
charging that the roof was unsafe 
juan lopezbutron of matamoros mexico whose wife graciela 
cortinas de lopez was the fifth victim pulled from the rubble 
filed two lawsuits monday 
lopezbutron accused the amigo store of failing to warn his wife 
a collapse could occur and failing to properly inspect the roof and 
its drainage system 
in a second suit he accused the stores builders adams 
brothers general contractors inc of failing to install a safe 
roof failing to inspect it and failing to properly install an 
adequate way to drain the flat surface in that suit he requests a 
trial by jury and asks for no more than 5 million in damages

meanwhile officials continued to investigate why the building 
collapsed during heavy rains thursday crushing 14 people to death 
and injuring at least 47 others 
glenn winslow of the southern building code congress of 
birmingham ala said investigators were checking whether some 
special characteristic of the building caused it to be affected by 
shifting rainwater that could have led to its collapse 
in this case its going to be very difficult because of the 
way the material was removed during the rescue winslow said the 
debris was later carted to the city dump 
he also said investigators were looking at whether the weight of 
the watersoaked building materials could have contributed to the 
collapse

along the downtown street past where the building once stood some 
passersby slowed to look at the stores sweptclean floor all 
that remains of the threestory structure 
nearby stores that closed during the rescue effort reopened

mikhail s gorbachev and wojciech 
jaruzelski speaking of painful episodes in their countries shared 
history say no one should shirk from examining the past honestly 
but the soviet and polish communist leaders stopped short monday 
of uttering the one word that symbolizes the most painful episode 
in polishsoviet relations and the one historical blank spot 
most poles want explicated 
neither said katyn the name of the forest in the soviet 
union where the bodies of about 4300 polish army officers were 
uncovered by nazi troops during world war ii 
each of the officers representing the cream of polish society 
was bound and shot with a single bullet to the base of the skull 
official soviet and polish histories have long maintained that 
the officers were killed by the nazis in 1941 but independent 
historians and most poles believe they were killed in 1940 on the 
orders of josef stalin by the nkvd secret police predecessor of 
the kgb 
a joint sovietpolish historical commission was charged last 
year with investigating the katyn massacre and other painful 
blank spots including the 1920 war between poland and the 
soviet union and stalins murder of virtually all leading members 
of the polish communist party in the late 1930s 
but polish officials have in recent days been playing down the 
possibility of any dramatic admission by gorbachev during his trip 
to poland this week 
on monday when gorbachev began the sixday visit to the soviet 
unions largest east bloc ally a small group of young men climbed 
atop a bus stop in central warsaw and unfurled a banner reading 
we demand the truth about katyn reparation for deportations 
katyn is a symbol of cruelty said leaflets they handed out 
it is a stillbleeding blank spot the explanation of which all 
poles demand 
among the katyn victims and 11000 other officers interned by 
the soviets whose fates remain unknown there were 800 doctors 50 
professors and hundreds of engineers lawyers teachers and 
writers the leaflets said 
poles have the right to know the truth about this holocaust on 
their outstanding fellow countrymen the leaflets said 
in his speech to polands parliament on monday gorbachev 
promised that more would be said about blank spots 
there are things that have to be revealed and shown more 
fully he said there is only one road to the truth here study 
of facts calm comparison of viewpoints and scientific discussions 
history cannot be replayed but lessons can and should be drawn 
from it 
jaruzelski voiced a similar theme every crime and every human 
suffering have a moral dimension they cannot be crossed out and 
one must not remain silent about them 
joint works of polish and soviet historians are under way we 
hope that they will allow us to better learn about the background 
course and nature of various dramatic events 
anticipating reporters questions about katyn officials 
scheduled a press conference after the parliament session by the 
polish and soviet chairmen of the historical commission 
investigating katyn 
the chairmen said they had some reason to question to the soviet 
source materials on katyn but could not say anything more without 
extensive further study

the governing party says new election returns 
confirm its claim that its candidate carlos salinas de gortari 
won the presidency even though votes are still being counted 
nearly a week after the election 
the institutional revolutionary party denies that final results 
are being delayed by vote fraud and squabbling among members of the 
party that is now losing its 60year near monopoly in mexican 
politics 
interior secretary manuel bartlett said monday that salinas had 
received 5289 percent of the 1324 million votes counted from 
wednesdays election 
he said the leftist national democratic fronts candidate 
cuauhtemoc cardenas was second with 291 percent and manuel 
clouthier of the conservative national action party was third with 
1668 percent 
the federal election commission did not say how many votes 
remained to be counted it said it would release final totals on 
wednesday and blamed the delays on computer problems and bad 
weather 
institutional revolutionary party officials conceded monday that 
cardenas won 58 percent of the vote in his home state of michoacan 
compared with 25 percent for salinas 
party officials in mexico city also said privately that cardenas 
was expected to win in the federal capital which has onequarter 
of mexicos people 
cardenas has claimed a national victory and clouthier has said 
he is leading the balloting 
the governing party has not lost a presidential senate or 
gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929 
the latest vote tallies confirmed the triumph of our candidate 
for the presidency said jorge de la vega dominguez the 
institutional revolutionary party chairman 
it is our duty to defend without wavering or compromises the 
governing partys popular mandate he said in a statement he 
read durign a news conference 
de la vega denied numerous reports that the vote tally has been 
delayed by party infighting 
the institutional revolutionary party is solidly united in 
its sectoral and territorial structure and with its broad 
militant base the leadership forms a single united will with our 
victorious candidate he said 
the party reportedly has been split between members of the old 
guard who resist change and reformists loyal to salinas who is 
seeking to modernize the political system 
opposition members have said the vote tally has been delayed by 
traditionalists who want to doctor the returns to reflect the 
partys usually huge margin of victory in excess of 70 percent in 
past elections 
the commission reconvened monday night to release additional 
results in races for the 500seat chamber of deputies only to 
adjourn until wednesday 
bartlett said the delay would allow time for the commission to 
obtain final results for the remaining congressional seats the 
senate and the presidency 
partial returns released monday gave 242 of the 500 seats in the 
lower house to the governing party 31 to national action party and 
10 to parties that support cardenas 
cardenas rejected the commission figures and said the slow vote 
count was enabling the government and the governing party to 
manipulate the results 
the figures of the federal electoral commission are not 
believable and only can be the product of fraud cardenas said 
he said his coalition might call a protest march for saturday in 
mexico city 
clouthier said irregularities in the elections have 
demonstrated the incapacity of the mexican government to organize 
trustworthy elections 
there were two elections those of july 6 conducted by the 
people and those conducted by the rulers last night he said 
opposition parties kept vigils outside district offices in an 
effort to prevent manipulation of the results

north korea has rejected as nothing new the 
proposals of president roh taewoo of south korea for improving 
relations between the two nations the norths official news agency 
said today 
roh on thursday unveiled a plan to ease his nations bitter 
confrontation with the communist north and pave the way for 
peaceful reunification of the divided peninsula 
this is nothing new and is not worth examination the korean 
central news agency quoted a statement issued by north koreas 
committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland as 
saying 
the news agency monitored in tokyo quoted the statement as 
saying that if the south korean authorities truly want dialogue 
and reunification they should respond though a bit late to our 
proposal for convocation of a northsouth joint conference 
in the july 7 special declaration roh called for broad trade 
humanitarian cultural and political contacts with the north 
the two koreas have been bitter rivals since their land was 
divided at the end of world war ii in 1945 they fought the korean 
war in 195053 
talks between the two koreas have been held intermittantly since 
the early 1970s they opened new talks in the early 1980s but 
north korea suspended all dialogue in 1986 to protest joint 
ussouth korea military exercises 
in seoul the yonhap news agency reported today that south korea 
was considering encouraging the united states and other western 
nations to open trade links with the north to help ease tensions

contra leaders say there is little hope for a 
peaceful move toward democracy in nicaragua where the sandinista 
government has expelled us diplomats quelled dissent and shut a 
newspaper and radio station 
they had been acting like a chameleon for months and months 
now they have shown their true colors adolfo calero a director 
of the usbacked rebels said by telephone today from washington 
we just hope that the united states europe and the free world 
once and for all accept that they are totalitarian and never had 
any interest in democracy he said 
the sandinista government on monday gave the us ambassador and 
seven other embassy officials three days to leave accusing them of 
state terrorism 
opposition newspaper la prensa and roman catholic radio station 
radio catolica were ordered shut down the moves came a day after 
police clashed with thousands of demonstrators at an 
antisandinista rally 40 miles outside managua 
calero said such actions fly in the face of a peace agreement 
signed three months ago with the contras in which the government 
pledged a series of steps aimed at satisfying the rebels demands 
for democratization 
at this point i cant see any further negotiations for a 
peaceful transition to freedom in nicaragua calero said the 
sandinistas have made it clear theyre just not interested 
pedro joaquin chamorro another contra director based in miami 
said the rebels have been negotiating in good faith with the 
sandinistas but that continued repression inside nicaragua would 
leave them little choice but to return to a fullscale armed 
struggle 
if that happens calero said in a telephone interview much of 
the blame should be placed on congress which in february rejected 
president reagans request for additional military aid to the 
contras 
those who were clamoring to give peace a chance in february 
defeated their own purpose by denying us aid calero said they 
took away the strength the resistance needed to keep the 
sandinistas at the negotiating table it doesnt look like were 
going to be doing much talking now

of a buddhist religious festival he said most would be released 
after questioning 
the government has only reported the arrests of four people in 
the slaying of a policeman the panchen lama said five people died 
in the violence while western travelers put the death toll at 
about 24 
the newspaper said the 52 people released included young monks 
from three major monasteries in the lhasa area and students from 
the tibet buddhism college it said that while in custody they 
studied the chinese constitution criminal law and relevant 
regulations 
the riot began when monks at a prayer festival shouted 
proindependence slogans and threw stones at police thousands of 
tibetans joined in and clashed with police throughout the city 
in september and october similar rioting left at least 14 dead 
the rioters followers of exiled spiritual leader the dalai 
lama claim china is illegally occupying the mountain region and 
demand an independent tibet 
china says tibet has been an inalienable part of the country for 
700 years communist troops entered tibet in 1950 and in 1959 put 
down an uprising during which the dalai lama and thousands of his 
followers fled to exile in india 
animosity between tibetans and nontibetan chinese reached a 
peak during the 196676 cultural revolution when radical leftists 
suppressed tibetan religion persecuted worshippers and destroyed 
buddhist temples 
since 1976 the beijing government has guaranteed freedom of 
religion and rebuilt some damaged temples but tensions have 
remained

an oil companys imageimprovement campaign 
could mean an end to the gulf sign thats marked lottie zimmermans 
family business for 70 years 
chevron usa inc which owns gulf has notified the 
80yearold proprietor that unless she spends an estimated 12000 
to spruce up her gas station it cant carry gulf products anymore 
the word that their pit stop isnt good enough for the corporate 
world comes as a shock to some of the regulars at the familyowned 
gonyos grocery and gulf station 
thats kind of sickening said truck driver louis walger 
sweating under the ceiling fans while waiting to pay for an 
icecold beer you dont find these old landmarks anymore this 
is our regular stop 
its been here years and years said rusty bunch 66 a 
retired neighbor lotties got coffee every morning and light 
beer in the evening 
but zimmerman who still offers credit on a promise said 
theres nothing she can do to prevent chevron from uprooting the 
gulf sign 
they dont want us anymore she said offering a copy of a 
letter from chevron mandating the improvements by the end of august 
unless the station considered one of the oldest gulf stations 
in texas is brought up to standards it will be debranded by 
chevron the letter says 
in a stationimage review in late 1987 the gonyos grocery and 
gulf service station was found to be lacking in the number of 
gasoline products it supplies to keep the corporate logo the 
station also needs painted curbs and bumpers concrete slabs on 
both sides of the pumps and a canopy 
there is no room to add more tanks and even if the 
imagebuilding orders were feasible the improvements would cost at 
least 12000 said mike krolczyk the local jobber who has 
supplied gonyos with gasoline for the past 15 years 
bill schroeder marketing manager for chevron usa inc in 
houston said customers expect a certain level of service when they 
see a gulf and chevron sign and the image review is an ordinary 
part of business 
were not trying to be heavyhanded or bad guys in this he 
said we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of our 
name he said 
integrity is something gonyos usually takes for granted its 
the nearly extinct kind of place where regular customers can keep a 
running bill zimmerman keeps the accounts in a worn cigar box on 
the counter

vietnams communist government said for 
the first time that it is willing to consider taking back large 
numbers of refugees who have fled the country a western refugee 
official said today 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister nguyen co thach first revealed 
their new position to thai foreign minister siddhi savetsila during 
talks in bangkok on june 20 
a thai foreign ministry official who declined to be named 
confirmed this today 
the western official said vietnam previously had said it would 
consider accepting refugees only on a casebycase basis which 
the official said is their way of saying no 
now they are saying they are willing to contemplate 
significant numbers of people returning said the official who 
has participated in negotiations on the issue with indochinese 
countries since at least 1982 
the new position could pave the way for cooperation with 
southeast asian nations that have complained about a recent surge 
of refugees arriving on their shores 
a united nations refugee official today said that there were 
45136 socalled vietnamese boat people in the regions refugee 
camps at the end of may an increase of 11664 from the previous 
year 
foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian nations 
said in annual talks last week that a repatriation program was one 
of the new approaches needed to deal with the influx of vietnamese 
refugees 
the western official said that in the earlier stages of the 
vietnamese exodus by boat which began with the communist victory 
in 1975 some groups of people later returned to vietnam 
in the past three to four years however few returns have been 
allowed 
the thai foreign ministry official said thach told siddhi that 
vietnam was ready to hold talks on the refugee issue with thailand 
and other southeast asian nations he said thach in an unusually 
conciliatory statement acknowledged that the influx had a 
negative impact on regional countries 
a vietnamese foreign ministry spokesman said in hanoi on july 7 
that vietnam was ready to discuss the problem with countries and 
international organizations and that it was taking measures to stop 
the clandestine exodus 
the british colony of hong kong host to record numbers of boat 
people in recent months last week announced it had accepted an 
invitation from hanoi for unprecedented talks on the issue 
hopes for a resolution of the problem recently have focused on 
repatriation because most people fleeing vietnam are considered 
economic migrants not people subjected to political persecution 
the proportion of genuine refugees has never been more than 10 
to 20 percent the western official said 
under a proposal by the united states and other countries the 
southeast asian nations would relax their tough policies and allow 
boat people to land safely officials would interview arrivals to 
separate economic migrants from political refugees the refugees 
would be resettled and the economic migrants would be returned to 
vietnam

western governors scouting for ways to boost the 
wests fortunes ventured off the beaten path of conference fare to 
meet with two gurus of corporate and government change 
the governors had some traditional topics on their agenda 
including foreign trade education and job training but their 
visitors monday warned the governors they must adapt and keep pace 
with a volatile and enormously competitive marketplace 
the conference with the theme sharpening the wests 
competitive edge continues here today 
the guest speakers monday were tom peters author of in search 
of excellence and thriving on chaos and david birch a 
professor at the massachusetts institute of technology and an 
expert on job creation 
the two were united in their plea for greater efficiency and 
inventiveness less government intrusion in the marketplace and a 
willingness to try wild and crazy experiments at the state 
level 
with chrysler boss lee iacoccas remarks earlier this year that 
he had contemplated a hostile takeover of general motors 
literally nothing is unthinkable and as goes general motors so 
goes the nation peters said literally all bets are off 
the rules are gone 
both peters and birch said americas largest companies are 
laying off people while most new hires are coming at new 
nicheseeking ventures small businesses such as specialty 
manufacturers the smaller firms with fewer layers of management 
and less tradition are able to develop new products and grab 
increasing shares of the market they said 
the fortune 500 firms have eliminated 31 million jobs in the 
1980s while more than 12 million jobs were created by businesses 
with fewer than 100 employees said birch 
peters urged state and federal governments to resist the urge to 
curb corporate competition even when it gets scary 
let the raiders go he said 
competition and even raid attempts may be just the ticket to 
bring life to aging lethargic companies he said 
we need to shape up our big companies and encourage our small 
companies peters said 
states can train train train a workforce that can support 
and entice new business and as soon as youre finished retrain 
retrain retrain he said 
incentive pay for teachers and public workers is a good idea and 
government should demand huge increases in productivity from its 
workers peters said 
gov garrey carruthers of new mexico urged his fellow governors 
to find radical but practical ways to do business 
colorado gov roy romer said the power of the governors 
office to bring change is an illusion in some cases and that 
states chief executives have to deal with entrenched bureaucracies 
and union protections 
states change only when the gun is at the temple he said 
some problems such as soaring health care costs are clearly 
beyond a governors control said oregon gov neil goldschmidt 
washington gov booth gardner chairman of the western 
governors association of 16 states and three territories said he 
and his colleagues were intrigued by the outsiders comments 
it really gets your ideas flowing he said its 
stimulating

prince norodom sihanouk said today that he resigned 
as president of the cambodian guerrilla coalition because of 
assaults on his forces by his supposed allies the radical 
communist khmer rouge 
the khmer rouge have taken advantage of the withdrawal of 
vietnamese forces west of the mekong river to step up attacks and 
ambushes against the sihanoukist national army the former 
cambodian head of state told reporters 
in the last few days i have lost quite a few soldiers and 
officers he said the khmer rouge want now to liquidate 
sihanoukism 
the prince also criticized backers of the coalition who favor 
the khmer rouge outrageously in their distribution of arms he 
did not specify who he was talking about but the khmer rouges 
main supplier and supporter is china 
sihanouk announced suddenly in bangkok on monday that he was 
going into exile in france and resigning as president of the 
alliance that groups his followers the khmer rouge and former 
premier son sanns anticommunist forces 
it was not clear what effect sihanouks sudden resignation the 
latest in a long series of startling moves by the mercurial prince 
would have on his future participation in cambodian affairs 
sihanouk took a leave of absence as president of the 
coalition last summer to conduct talks with cambodian prime 
minister hun sen then resigned jan 30 accusing his partners of 
undermining his negotiations 
he rescinded the resignation a month later 
arriving in france early today sihanouk told reporters his 
decision to step down was irrevocable this time 
the khmer rouge under its feared leader pol pot ruled cambodia 
from 197578 when a vietnamese invasion ended their bloody reign 
sihanouk called on france the united states and other countries 
to take steps to prevent the return of polpotism in all its 
horror in cambodia he complained that certain sponsors of the 
coalition continue to exploit the sihanouk name to permit the khmer 
rouge to seize power 
the prince also said he would not attend multilateral peace 
talks scheduled to begin july 25 in indonesia he said his son 
prince norodom ranariddh would replace him at the talks 
the talks the first to include representatives of all the 
warring parties has raised hopes for a political settlement to the 
longstanding conflict 
last week sihanouk met with secretary of state george p 
shultz and senior officials of japan and thailand to discuss the 
peace process 
the foreign ministers of the association of southeast asian 
nations and their western partners declared at their annual talks 
in bangkok that sihanouk should have a central role in the 
indonesia talks and in a future cambodian government 
even after he resigned us state deparatment spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said the united states believes sihanouks 
leadership represents the best prospect for a successful 
resolution of the cambodian issue and a stable postsettlement 
government in cambodia 
sihanouk ruled cambodia from 1941 until 1970 when he was 
overthrown in a military coup he was kept under house arrest by 
the khmer rouge but in 1982 he joined the khmer rouge and son 
sanns noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front in 
the coalition recognized by the united nations as cambodias 
legitimate government 
the foreign ministers of cambodia thailand and vietnam met on 
monday in phnom penh the cambodian capital and said they were 
committed to a political solution 
in a joint communique the ministers said all vietnamese troops 
would leave cambodia by 1990 or sooner if a settlement is reached 
but they said there must be a guarantee that the khmer rouge not 
return to power

vietnam will return to the united 
states on wednesday what it believes are the remains of 25 missing 
us servicemen in one of the largest ever turnovers the us 
embassy said today 
an embassy statement said the remains will be flown from 
vietnams capital of hanoi to the us army central identification 
laboratory in hawaii for identification and return to nextofkin 
remains are usually returned in a simple ceremony at hanois noi 
bai airport with a us officials saluting as a us military 
honor guard carries the caskets onto a us military transport 
plane 
the turnover would be the fifth since retired gen john w 
vessey acting as a special presidential envoy reached an 
agreement in hanoi last august to significantly speed up progess on 
the issue 
the united states was told about the remains during regular 
talks in hanoi last month between technical experts of the two 
sides 
the lack of diplomatic relations between the two countries has 
hindered the attempt to account for the fates of nearly 1800 
americans who remain missing in action us forces withdrew from 
south vietnam in 1973 after the involvement cost 58000 american 
lives 
the last return of remains on april 6 was the largest ever 
vietnam returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified as 
those of americans and three other sets which it said were those 
of ethnic asians who might possibly be among the missing americans

wanted good homes for 10000 worth of 
shampoo hair conditioner and bath gel in 97900 little packets 
the fairmont hotel is getting rid of those packets that grace 
many hotel bathrooms as part of its preparations for the republican 
national convention 
we replaced them with superior plastic bottles said 
hotel spokesman john de mers what makes them superior of 
course is you dont have to rip them open with your teeth and get 
shampoo in your mouth and you can get two or three shampoos out of 
one bottle plus people love to take them home as souvenirs 
de mers had two questions when the hotel chains san francisco 
headquarters ordered him to get rid of the packets how many were 
there and who should they go to 
it took time to answer the first question 
i got someone to lead me to the shampoo and started counting 
and i counted and i counted and i counted de mers said monday 
it turned out there were 38500 packets of shampoo 54900 of 
hair conditioner and 4500 of bath gel 
there still was the question of who should get them 
you can give food to the foodless and homes to the homeless 
but who do you give shampoo to he asked 
so the hotel is holding a send us the suds contest with aug 15 
the day the republican national convention gavels down in the 
superdome as the deadline for twopage written entries explaining 
how much shampoo conditioner or bath gel is wanted and what its 
wanted for 
i would have to say that the more unexpected the reason the 
better said de mers were looking purposely for needs that we 
cant possibly anticipate people shouldnt stop entering if they 
have a fairly strange reason they need the shampoo it may just 
make them a winner

a security council debate on the us 
missile attack on a iranian passenger jet has been postponed until 
thursday officials said 
diplomatic sources familiar with council procedures said council 
president paulo nogueirabatista of brazil delayed the meeting 
originally scheduled for today after consultations with us 
ambassador vernon a walters irans un ambassador mohammad 
jaafar mahallati and members of the council 
the 15member security council was preparing to consider an 
iranian declaration condemning the united states for shooting down 
the plane in the persian gulf on july 3 iran said all 290 people 
aboard died 
the united states britain and france are expected to use their 
veto power as permanent council members to stop any censure 
resolution or any demand that the us fleet leave the gulf 
the sources said iran had been unable to gain a council majority 
to condemn the downing of the jetliner and it would present a 
statement to be followed by a debate without submitting a 
resolution 
washington says the uss vincennes shot down the plane by 
accident believing the jetliner was an attacking warplane 
the decision to delay the council meeting was made late monday 
earlier monday the us government announced an offer of 
voluntary compensation to families of victims but not to the 
iranian government 
mahallati when asked about the us government announcement 
said reparation is not sufficient definitely because the root 
cause of this tragedy and similar tragedies should be removed from 
the persian gulf 
and it cannot be anything less than withdrawal of us forces 
from the persian gulf 
requesting the council debate is a turnabout for iran which has 
boycotted council sessions for years because it claims the council 
bows to pressure from washington and is biased against iran in the 
8yearold war with iraq iran wants america condemned for murder 
in the airliner incident 
western diplomats said the united states is expected to argue 
that the war and irans refusal to accept a truce are at the root 
of the problem 
the united states has been urging the council to impose an arms 
embargo on iran to compel it to accept a ceasefire called for in a 
resolution the council passed unanimously on jul 20 1987 
iraq has agreed to accept a ceasefire but iran demands that 
iraq be branded the aggressor before a truce takes effect 
nations now on the council are the permanent members the 
united states britain china france and soviet union and 
algeria argentina brazil italy japan nepal senegal west 
germany yugoslavia and zambia

nasa officials said they dont expect 
damage to a test booster will delay the tentatively scheduled 
september launch of the first space shuttle since the 1986 
challenger disaster 
the accident will however postpone the final testfiring of 
morton thiokols redesigned booster from july 25 until the end of 
august officials said 
the booster was damaged saturday when a worker testing one of 
the motors three field joints inadvertently switched 
pressurization lines and damaged insulation that helps contain 
superheated gasses during flight morton thiokol spokesman rocky 
raab said monday 
however edward s campion of the national aeronautics and space 
administration said we do not expect it to affect the sts26 
launch schedule 
sts26 is the designation for the first flight of a space 
shuttle since the jan 28 1986 explosion destroyed challenger and 
killed seven crew members 
an 11member panel from the national academy of sciences will 
meet next week to evaluate the mishap 
nasa spokesman david garrett said the test motor will have to be 
partially disassembled for evaluation and possible repairs 
after the rocket is opened up at the joint well have 
something more to say said nasa spokesman ken atchison in 
washington at this point our best estimate is that we dont 
anticipate a delay 
the damaged test rocket already contained severe intentional 
flaws designed to determine whether the redesigned joints can 
withstand the heat and pressure of launch even in the event of some 
failures 
the test rocket incorporates a new design created after 
challenger exploded after its launch from the kennedy space center 
the explosion was blamed on a faulty booster joint that allowed 
a plume of superhot gas to burn through an oring triggering the 
blast

superpower talks on reducing longrange nuclear 
arsenals resumed today after a sevenweek break with both sides 
identifying at least two major hurdles toward completing a draft 
treaty 
before the opening session us chief delegate max kampelman 
reaffirmed washingtons stand that a pact that would halve each 
sides stockpile should not be held hostage to limits sought by 
moscow on us plans for a largescale space defense against 
ballistic missiles 
the other chief source of disagreement centers on soviet 
insistence on limiting sealaunched cruise missiles 
asked whether negotiators see a possible fifth superpower summit 
or the end of ronald reagans presidency in january as a deadline 
kampelman told reporters talks will continue no matter who is 
president and no matter who the leader of the soviet union is 
i dont think important issues should be governed by the 
calendar he said if it takes longer fine if it takes 
shorter fine 
kampelman chief soviet negotiator alexei obukhov and their full 
delegations met for about two hours at the us mission to launch 
the 10th round of geneva talks since march 1985 the session then 
recessed for the day and no date was immediately announced for the 
next session 
the ninth round of talks recessed before the may 29june 2 
summit between reagan and mikhail s gorbachev which produced only 
slight progress toward a longrange nuclear forces treaty 
the superpower leaders then ordered negotiators to continue 
energetically and purposefully no end date has been announced 
for this new round 
the chief negotiators hinted that a breakthrough is not in sight 
dont look for drama kampelman told reporters monday 
were at a stage now where hard work is required rather than 
drama 
obukhov warned after his arrival sunday we do not want to 
lose momentum 
while both negotiators said the talks have come a long way 
kampelman also noted much that is important still remains to be 
solved 
he said a draft could still be completed under the reagan 
administration and voiced hope the new round will at the very 
least significantly narrow the differences between us 
both sides agree that the proposed strategic arms reduction 
treaty should cut each sides stocks over seven years to an overall 
limit of 6000 nuclear warheads and 1600 launchers such as heavy 
bombers and landbased intercontinental missiles 
some details of monitoring compliance with a future pact are 
also settled but both negotiators stressed more work was needed 
obukhov told reporters progress now depends primarily on 
resolving disputes over us plans to develop a spacebased missile 
defense system called the strategic defense initiative and on 
limiting the deployment of longrange sealaunched cruise missiles 
we reject the soviet attempts to use these negotiations to 
have us end our strategic defense initiative kampelman said 
for sealaunched cruise missiles the soviets have proposed 
limits and called for anticheating measures including inspections 
of warships 
washington has balked saying the weapons cannot be reliably 
detected 
on monday us negotiator steven hanmer called the soviet 
verification proposals totally impractical and said current 
prospects for resolving the issue are dim 
last december reagan and gorbachev signed a treaty scrapping 
all intermediaterange nuclear forces both countries ratified that 
pact shortly before the moscow summit

two black families have become the first black 
tenants in 10 years at a public housing project in south boston 
the scene of racial violence when public schools were integrated in 
the 1970s 
the families moved monday into the mary ellen mccormack housing 
project and were greeted by cathy flynn wife of mayor raymond 
flynn police kept bystanders and reporters at a distance during 
the move which took place without incident 
elizabeth clinkscales and bessie payne and their families stayed 
in their apartments monday and would not comment 
ms clinkscales and ms payne both 36 met with reporters on 
saturday and expressed a desire to begin a stable life in their 
apartments 
it will take some courage to do it but im just doing it 
because im a decent human being that needs to live somewhere 
said ms clinkscales who lives with her 19yearold daughter and 
4yearold grandson 
im no pioneer said ms payne im just almost a homeless 
person and i dont like that feeling at all im looking forward 
to making a new home and getting my life straightened out again 
ms payne has a 13yearold son and 8yearold daughter 
the families were given threebedroom apartments by the boston 
housing authority after they were evicted from other apartments 
their move is not part of an ongoing integration plan affecting 
31 of 69 public housing projects including the 1000tenant 
mccormack 
the plan by flynn and the us department of housing and urban 
development seeks to provide subsidized housing for an estimated 
500 black families passed over for placement in south boston and 
charlestown projects since 1983 
city officials hope successful implementation of the plan will 
stall a lawsuit by minority groups 
many residents watching the families move in to mccormack felt 
the black families would not encounter problems 
i really think the press has blown it out of proportion 
said 18yearold kelly manion well get along together in fact 
it just might be good for the people living here

a man convicted of masterminding a fake 
plane crash during a heavy snowstorm has been sentenced to one year 
in a federal prison and ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation 
the sentence given monday to mark blair sends a strong message 
that its a serious crime to cry wolf said us attorney richard 
wiebusch 
the radio report sparked a search last jan 8 that cost 50000 
and involved as many as 100 people 20 aircraft and six police 
agencies they looked for a downed jet with three dead passengers 
and a badly injured pilot 
us circuit judge hugh bownes said more than minimal planning 
was involved in faking the crash during the storm in which 
visibility was onehalf mile temperatures were in the teens and 
nine inches of snow fell 
blair must have known that the fake report would set off a 
massive ground and air search bownes said 
blair 29 was convicted in may of making a false report to the 
government a crime punishable by a fine and up to five years 
prison 
although blair said he was not surprised by the sentence he 
insisted he is innocent and will appeal bownes declined to set 
bail for blair pending appeal 
at the trial blair testified that he couldnt have committed 
the hoax because he was asleep and wasnt aware a plane had been 
reported down 
but one of his neighbors testified that he heard the sound of a 
twoway radio through blairs window and a voice crying out for 
help 
david webster a navy reservist and delta airlines pilot 
testified that he and his crew tracked the voice of a man who 
talked sporadically and said that he was loosing blood was chilled 
and weak and that at least one person in his plane was dead 
webster 39 testified that his crew was overcome with emotion 
when the man said he heard the navy plane overhead 
people in my plane were screaming and yelling i got tears 
in my eyes thinking were going to get this guy out webster 
said 
bownes recommended that blair be jailed at the federal 
correctional institution in butner nc a prison with extensive 
psychiatric facilities 
blair also was sentenced to two years probation during which 
he will be required to receive mental health counseling

president reagans decision to pay families of 
the 290 people killed in the us downing of an iranian airliner 
met fresh resistance on capitol hill today with some lawmakers 
saying the gesture is premature and politically touchy 
the united states of america is not guilty of anything 
except protecting the lives of american sailors rep gerald 
solomon rny said on nbctvs today show 
he contended that the iranian government deliberately provoked 
the us cruiser vincennes into firing on the jetliner and said 
i dont think theres any question this was a provoked attack 
it was an act of martyrdom by the iranian government to bring 
humiliation on the united states and we should not be a part of 
that at this time solomon said 
sen john mccain rariz concurred 
its too early there are many serious questions that need to 
be resolved before we would contemplate compensation we should 
also expect some progress on the hostage situation he said on 
abctvs good morning america 
i dont see why theres this rush to judgment 
their comments echoed those of other members of congress who 
said after mondays announcement that the distinction may be 
largely lost on the us electorate which harbors longsimmering 
resentment of iran stemming from the seizure of the us embassy in 
1979 from its sponsorship of international terrorism and from the 
continued holding of americans in lebanon 
reagans request has some problems added rep tony coelho 
dcalif the chief democratic vote counter in the house who said 
he personally opposed the idea i dont understand why theyre 
trying to move it along 
but sen john chafee rri appearing with solomon responded 
that compensating the families of those who died is the fair and 
the just and the right thing to do were not admitting any 
guilt 
sen christopher dodd dconn also appearing on good morning 
america said reagans offer distinguishes us from others 
its the sign of a compassionate and strong nation 
the disagreement spread even to two former hostages in iran who 
appeared on cbstvs this morning 
morehead kennedy suggested forming a mixed claims commission to 
handle us claims against iran as well as that nations claims 
against the united states 
such a procedure would establish a connection with the nine 
americans held hostage in beirut he suggested 
i dont think that we should go this guilt trip by 
ourselves kennedy said there is a very culpable iranian guilt 
here 
another victim of the us embassy takeover in iran bruce 
laingen said however that he agrees with reagan this is a clear 
case where we have a humanitarian obligation to offer compensation 
to the victims he said 
reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater said in mondays 
announcement that reagan was motivated by humanitarian concerns and 
was acting out of charity rather than obligation he made it clear 
that payments were to go to victims families and not to the tehran 
government of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a navy investigative team is still looking into the incident in 
which the vincennes fired on the airliner after mistaking it for a 
warplane 
numerous questions about reagans decision remained unanswered 
including how much money would be paid to the families how contact 
would be made in the absence of formal diplomatic relations between 
the two countries and just what legal authority would be used to 
make the payments 
a state department official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said it is not clear whether a flat amount will be paid 
for each victim or whether the age number of dependents and 
earnings of the victims will be taken into account in assessing 
compensation 
it also was unclear whether the gesture would require 
congressional legislation congressional leaders assumed that the 
white house would seek house and senate approval out of a desire 
for support for its policy decision if not out of a need for money 
to pay the families 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said offering payments to the 
survivors of the victims would be a voluntary act committed by a 
nation that is both generous and genuinely regretful of the 
incident he said he expected quick action once reagan formally 
makes a request of congress 
if the president is satisfied that payments are warranted i 
would imagine the congress would be satisfied wright said 
leading members of the congressional foreign policy and defense 
committees also have spoken out in favor of making such payments 
we are a just and generous people said sen arlen specter 
rpa who said the payments should go forward on basic grounds 
of fairness and decency 
fitzwater said the money would be channeled through some 
thirdparty organization or intermediary such as the red crescent 
an arm of the red cross he acknowledged that the united states 
still has not determined how to verify the identities of the dead 
or survivors who will likely make compensation claims 
all but 38 of the iran air passengers were from iran the others 
were from india italy pakistan turkey yugoslavia and the united 
arab emirates 
a national washington postabc news poll last week found that 61 
percent of those surveyed opposed the idea of paying compensation 
that finding appeared to take on substantial weight just four 
months before congressional elections 
some lawmakers linked the payment issue with the question of 
us hostages who continue to be held in lebanon apparently by 
radical elements with ties to iran mccain said the hostages should 
be freed as part of any compensation deal 
but wright said that would amount to ransoming them and 
fitzwater added i dont think there are very many congressmen 
who want it to appear were doing business with iran over the 
hostages 
fitzwater said the payments would be what lawyers call ex 
gratia made voluntarily without admitting guilt or liability 
under international law nations have no legal liability for 
damages caused as a result of war or hostilities 
but some administration advisers have been concerned that the 
united states not be likened to the soviet union which refused to 
make compensation after shooting down a korean air lines passenger 
plane over the sea of japan in 1983 according to congressional 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity

iraqi forces today pushed irans army out 
of the last major pockets of iraqi territory it held along the 
southern border the official iraqi radio said 
iran said its warplanes bombed iraqi positions in the southern 
zubaidat region of iraq but did not say the iraqi forces had 
regained control of the area iran also announced its forces were 
pulling back from positions in iraqs northern mountains 
iraqs presidential guards spearheaded the offensive to retake a 
chunk of land in the zubaidat region along the border with iran 
according to war communiques broadcast by iraqi radio 
the offensive began just after dawn and the zubaidat area 
five missions over the zubaidat region 
irna also said iranian troops had retreated from the town of 
halabja in northeastern iraq to new defensive positions the 
retreat was designed to ma more secure approaches the 
in baghdad there was no official confirmation of an assault on 
halabja but military sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said an attack has been expected for weeks 
iran seized halabja in the kurdish area of iraq last march it 
later accused iraq of unleashing a chemical weapons offensive 
against the town killing 5000 people 
iraqi communiques concentrated on the retaking of the zubaidat 
region which fell to iran several years ago neither country 
confirmed how much territory iran held in the area 
the communiques said an unspecified number of iranians were 
either killed or wounded in todays battle east of amara which is 
180 miles southeast of the iraqi capital of baghdad 
it is the latest in a series of battlefield defeats for iran 
since the iraqis took back the faw peninsula on april 18 
the communique announcing that the zubaidat area had been 
recaptured was widely believed written by president saddam hussein 
he has written them in the past and the phrasing in todays latest 
report mirrored his style 
it reiterated iraqs readiness to end the war under terms of a 
un security councils resolution 598 the resolution calls for an 
immediate ceasefire and an independent inquiry into which side 
started the 8yearold war

sony corp said today it will begin marketing 
vhsformat video cassette recorders in the united states this fall 
a sony official said the electronics giant began marketing 
vhsformat vcrs in europe in may and will begin selling them in 
japan july 21 
sony has produced and marketed only betaformat vcrs in the 
past and the official said sony will continue to market 
betaformat vcrs at home and abroad in fiscal 1988 which ends next 
march 31 
sonys decision to manufacture vhsformat vcrs capped a long 
rivalry between its beta system introduced in 1975 and the 
incompatible vhs standard introduced a year later by the japan 
victor corp jvc 
since their introduction the number of companies selling beta 
machines has declined while vhs models have grown in popularity 
currently accounting for an estimated 90 percent of the world 
market 
analysts have said sony was not active enough in soliciting 
other companies to join it in making and marketing the beta system 
and was late in responding to consumer demand

under a state law customwritten for lyndon 
johnson in 1959 sen lloyd bentsen of texas could run for 
reelection to the senate and for vice president at the same time 
johnson who was john f kennedys running mate won both races 
in 1960 and later became the first president from texas but 
johnsons dual victories cost his party a senate seat they have yet 
to win back 
bentsen is a heavy favorite to win senate reelection over 
republican challenger beau boulter a west texas congressman but 
if bentsen becomes vice president his senate seat would be 
declared open in january and texas gov bill clements a 
republican would appoint an interim replacement 
a replacement to fill out the sixyear term would be picked by 
the voters in a spring special election the same route republican 
john tower used in 1961 to replace johnson that wild race drew 70 
candidates tower and bill blakley a democrat appointed as interim 
senator by thendemocratic gov john connally advanced to a 
runoff which tower won 
the democrats could never beat tower he retired in 1984 and 
republican phil gramm won the seat 
boulter bentsens senate race opponent has said it would be 
greedy for bentsen to run for two jobs 
hes making it look like the senate is unimportant boulter

jesse jackson isnt making life easy for michael 
dukakis 
dukakis and his aides undoubtedly hoped next weeks democratic 
national convention would allow the massachusetts governor to bask 
solo in the warmth of a primetime party unity festival the 
next step toward a showdown with george bush in the fall 
that was until jackson decided to campar the 
vice presidential nomination to arrange a grand arrival in this 
convention city and encourage a few thousand of his closest friends 
to join him and deign arduously foride the proposed barebones platform 
crafted by 
the dukakis forces 
jackson was asked a few days ago whether he was worried about 
stealing some of dukakis thunder 
it has nothing to do with thunder was his taunting reply 
mr dukakis had no intention of bringing any thunder to atlanta 
dukakis today stole some of jacksons thunder according a 
wellplaced democratic party source dukakis will announce later 
today that he has selected sen lloyd bwe intend to have an effective 
informative convention that 
would inspire our nation unify our party and take us to victory 
he said monday 
but he also said that his actions in the future will be 
influenced by the treatment his candidacy and platform proposals 
receive 
the conclusion of those steps will in some measure determine 
what our fall activities will be he said 
jackson has an uncanny ability to remain on the stage long after 
other politicians would have departed he remained a campaigner in 
the primary season long after a conventional politician would have 
run out of money and called it quits 
 
he campaigned assiduously for the vice presidential nomination 
while others who want it as much or more practically blush anytime 
the subject is mentioned within their earshot who else in american 
politics would announce one day that he had decided whether he 
would accept an offer to join dukakis on the ticket but wouldnt 
tell anyone what his decision was 
and who else would describe as unknown quantities all the 
other contenders for the vice presidential nomination 
his platform issues will be debated on national television next 
week if it goes that far he will speak during prime time on the 
second night of the convention his name will be entered into 
nomination for president the following night 
and it is conceivable that his name could be put into nomination 
for vice president on the final night in a final symbolic clash 
with dukakis 
that of course would give him the chance to go to the podium 
once more perhaps to bestow his blessing at last on dukakis and 
his running mate 
but even now jackson is making sure the spotlight doesnt turn 
away from him when the convention ends 
he declared on monday before the choice of bentsen became 
known that if dukakis offered him second place on the ticket i 
would accept it he said he assured dukakis emissary paul 
brountas that he would be a loyal vice president 
but jackson said that if he were not chosen he would expect 
further discussions with dukakis before defining what role he will 
play in the fall campaign

defense secretary frank carlucci today 
promised appropriate action including contract suspensions if 
the ongoing pentagon bribery probe turns up new evidence that some 
contracts may be tainted 
carlucci said he lifted his july 1 suspensions of nine military 
programs because a navy review did not indicate that any of the 
current contracts in the affected programs are tainted 
the pentagon is beginning actions to ban two companies and three 
individuals from doing further business with the defense department 
carlucci told the senate armed services committee that if 
other official information becomes available during the course of 
the investigation which warrants new concern regarding these or 
other contracts the department will evaluate it and take any 
appropriate action 
he outlined actions the pentagon may take including rescinding 
terminating or suspending contracts or fining individuals 
the decisions arose from the criminal investigation of 
allegations that defense contractors and consultants bribed 
pentagon officials for contracting details that could be vital in 
winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
carlucci also said he is writing to the chief executives of the 
top 200 defense contractors urging them to ensure stringent 
management controls on the use of consultants and to avoid improper 
business practices 
the acquisition system has problems carlucci admitted there 
are defects in how america equips its forces he said 
the current investigation is a good reason to correct those 
flaws he said even if the probe reveals no more than the 
misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers i still want to move forward 
now in cooperation with congress to remedy flaws in our system 
regardless of whether those flaws are related to the justice 
investigation 
the companies suspended monday were varian continental of dallas 
and acquisition control of alexandria va the three individuals 
were former navy procurement officer mark saunders consultant 
thomas e muldoon and varian official joe bradley 
carluccis july 1 announcement of contract suspensions had come 
in the wake of congressional calls for strong action but the 
suspensions were surrounded by confusion from the beginning with 
pentagon officials unable to say exactly what work was covered and 
when the actions took effect 
contractors meanwhile said they were not formally notified so 
they continued to work on the contracts 
the contracts were with litton industries unisys trw itt 
continental electronics loral terracom canadian commercial 
hughes aircraft and raytheon corp 
charles bowsher head of the congressional general accounting 
office told the armed services committee on monday that quick 
actions should not be undertaken while the criminal investigation 
is under way 
it might be better to let the investigative process work 
said bowsher later he said if there are indictments contracts 
could be suspended should there be convictions companies and 
individuals could then be barred from doing business he said 
all three men suspended monday from doing pentagon business have 
been identified in fbi affidavits as having allegedly traded in 
inside contract information 
the fbi said saunders a former navy procurement officer who was 
convicted of stock trading on insider navy information in 1982 was 
receiving inside contract data from george stone his navy 
successor the bureau said it believes that saunders is paying 
stone for this information 
the navy has begun actions to suspend stone without pay the 
pentagon said monday 
bradley is vice president for marketing of varian continental 
he has been placed on administrative leave muldoon is a former 
unisys employee who set up his own consulting firm in washington 
an fbi affidavit said muldoon paid saunders 4000 out of an 
8000 monthly retainer from litton industries in exchange for 
contract information 
in his congressional testimony bowsher noted that past defense 
buildups during world war ii and the korean war were also 
tarnished by procurement problems 
history shows that when too much money is pumped into the 
acquisition system over a relatively short period of time we will 
have problems he said 
but in contrast to past cases which generally involved 
lowerlevel people one thing that distinguishes this case is 
its fairly high up bowsher said 
the thing that discourages me the most is that some very 
senior people might be involved he said 
besides the possible criminal charges said bowsher another 
problem is likely to arise from the reagan administration military 
buildup 
i think the other shoe will probably fall soon namely many 
big cost overruns he told the committee 
i suspect the stealth airplane program the navy shipbuilding 
programs and the other programs which have to be stretched because 
of budget constraints will all result in very large cost increases 
that the congress will have to finance he said 
stretch out refers to a pentagon practice adopted when 
budgets are tight of buying the same number of weapons but doing 
it over a longer period intervening price hikes frequently end up 
increasing the overall cost

reporters artists photographers and 
columnists for the washington post withheld their bylines from 
todays editions of the newspaper to protest the two years they 
have gone without a labor contract with the company 
the last contract between post management and the 
washingtonbaltimore newspaper guild expired july 9 1986 
in a flier distributed in the newsroom lew diuguid head of the 
bargaining committee of the post unit of the union accused the 
post of failure to bargain in good faith the guild said it 
planned a twoday byline strike 
union leaders say there is a twotier pay system which 
established a lower minimum scale for those hired after 1976 
causing what they say is pay discrimination by race and sex 
the union also opposes what it says is a pattern of forceouts 
of expensive senior employees 
in a statement executive editor benjamin c bradlee and 
managing editor leonard downie jr said we all want a new 
contract between the post and the guild and that the post has 
now signed contracts with every one of the other 10 unions 
represented at the newspaper 
the statement denied existence of a twotier wage system and 
said the post is not trying to force out higher paid employees 
the last negotiated contract between the guild and the post 
established a top minimum pay rate of 66435 a week sandra 
polaski administrator for the guild said that under 
companyimposed rules pay has been raised leaving an average 
240aweek gap between white males who are at the high end of the 
scale and black females at the low end 
she said that even when black women and white men with the same 
experience and time at the newspaper are compared an average 
170aweek pay discrepancy exists 
the guild is filing a class action complaint this week with the 
dc office of human rights asking for an investigation of 
differences in pay hiring promotion and discharge based on sex 
race national origin and age polaski said

president reagans selection of richard l 
thornburgh as his next attorney general marks a return for the 
toughminded former pennsylvania governor to the law enforcement 
roots that first propelled him into the public eye in 1969 
reagan said today that he had chosen thornburgh to replace edwin 
meese iii who announced last week that he would resign by early 
august 
former members of thornburghs gubernatorial administration were 
quick to point out his reputation for integrity and that he 
eliminated the corruption that tainted the tenure of his 
predecessor democrat milton shapp 
they also noted the close ties thornburgh has kept with the 
reagan administration 
as governor thornburgh 55 frequently testified on capitol 
hill on behalf of the presidents proposal for lineitem veto power 
and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget he has turned 
down offers to head the fbi and agency for international 
development and was considered for the health and human services 
cabinet post in 1985 
as governor thornburgh said his budget proposals held spending 
increases to less than the rate of inflation for eight straight 
years he championed a controversial welfare reform law that 
limited cash benefits to three months a year for an estimated 
68000 people considered ablebodied 
but it was his abilities as a prosecutor that first won him 
headlines he was appointed us attorney for western pennsylvania 
in 1969 his attacks on organized crime drug trafficking and 
pornography led to his being appointed assistant attorney general 
in charge of the justice departments criminal division by 
president ford in 1975 
in fact for the first few hours of jimmy carters 
administration he was the highestranking person at the justice 
department said gwen king who left a post as head of 
thornburghs washington office to become a deputy assistant at the 
white house 
hes certainly someone whose integrity is beyond question 
she said before his appointment was confirmed he could bring 
stability and integrity to the position without any doubt and 
frankly i think the administration would be wellserved to ask 
him 
democratic critics said thornburgh lacked compassion and were 
fond of reciting a story of a poor women who began badgering the 
governor during a campaign swing in erie county in 1982 things 
are tough all over thornburgh told the woman 
but his supporters describe thornburgh as methodical and cool 
under pressure 
all of us who worked for him always viewed him as a person who 
weighed things so carefully and was so methodical and precise that 
he would be perfect as attorney general said shirley dennis the 
pennsylvania secretary of community affairs under thornburgh who 
now heads the womens bureau at the us department of labor 
barred by law from seeking a third term as governor thornburgh 
left pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the institute of 
politics at harvard universitys kennedy school of government but 
he hardly retreated from the public eye 
rather thornburgh was busier than ever on the political circuit 
back home leading observers to believe his stint at harvard may 
have only been a break between campaigns of one sort or another 
thornburgh has been said to be considering running for governor 
again when democrat robert casey comes up for reelection in 1990 
he also had been mentioned as a possible running mate for george 
bush 
hes a politician his longtime aide david runkel said in a 
telephone interview he has not closed the door on another 
campaign for something 
thornburghs recent activity has included two fundraisers that 
have netted about 100000 for the governor thornburgh 
committee an account he uses to support his travels on behalf of 
other candidates runkel said 
in addition thornburgh is cochairman of pennsylvanias 
victory 88 a federal fund that distributes money for phone 
banks and other republican campaign efforts 
the possibility of a bushthornburgh ticket excited 
pennsylvanias republican convention delegates many of whom named 
the former governor as their top choice for the second spot on the 
ticket 
in 1960 an automobile accident killed thornburghs wife and 
left his youngest son braindamaged he was married again in 1963 
to schoolteacher ginny judson

as the 1988 democratic vice presidential 
candidate sen lloyd bentsen of texas will share an attribute with 
many candidates for the the second spot at the moment of his 
selection he is largely unknown to the american public 
few recent polls have sought to gauge the impact of bentsen on 
the ticket in part because pollsters gauged his chance of 
selection as low and in part because so many potential voters have 
no opinion of him 
in a national gallup poll in midmay 77 percent of respondents 
said they had not heard enough about bentsen to say what they 
thought of him the margin of error for the remainder was very 
high about 8 percentage points 
of those few with an opinion 3 percent said they had a very 
favorable view of bentsen 12 percent mostly favorable 6 percent 
mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable 
gallup computed a ticket strengthening index in that poll to 
gauge the help a vice presidential candidate could bring his 
ticket new jersey sen bill bradley and sen john glenn of ohio 
rated highest bentsen was near the bottom however that measure 
was limited by the number of people with an opinion of each 
potential candidate and in bentsens case that was low 
there are many other vice presidential possibilties that are 
more popular than bentsen basically the guy just does not have 
much name recognition on a national scale said larry hugick a 
gallup pollster 
hugick noted that gallup just completed a poll during the 
weekend that tested two possibile dukakis running mates glenn and 
sen albert gore of tennessee we picked the wrong southerner 
he said 
in an nbc newswall street journal poll last month 60 percent 
said the vice president candidate was very important to their 
choice of a ticket but bentsen was not among the five possible 
democratic runningmates tested 
a cbs newsnew york times poll in may tested glenn sen sam 
nunn of georgia and jesse jackson as possible running mates but 
again not bentsen jeff alderman pollster for abc news said he 
also has not tested bentsen as a candidate for vice president 
it would remain to be seen based on his performance and how 
dukakis utilizes his new choice here how much he helps alderman 
said hes well known in texas presumably it helps there in the 
rest of the country it remains to be seen how well hell play 
because he is not known by a vast majority of the country at all 
alderman noted however that many other candidates for vice 
president and even for president start as relative unknowns in a 
cbstimes poll in november for example 77 percent of respondents 
had no opinion of dukakis

a former navy photographer said he was 
transferred from the blue angels after he entered photographs of a 
fatal collision between two jets from the flight demonstration 
squadron in a photo contest 
wayne singleton said the photographs were pulled from the 
contest because they were embarrassing to the navy 
blue angels spokesman lt cmdr doug hocking however said 
singleton was made available for transfer and the photographs were 
removed because of their graphic content and his failure to obtain 
authorization before entering them 
the pictures shoed a 1985 collision during an air show over 
niagara falls ny one pilot was killed and the other pilot 
parachuted to safety after the collision and an investigation 
blamed pilot error 
singleton entered the photographs in the 1986 military 
photographer of the year contest 
two photos of the crash by singleton were published monday in 
the pensacola new journal which said it received the photos 
anonymously the blue angels are based at the pensacola naval air 
station 
singleton now a civilian freelance photographer reportedly 
living in arizona said he was scheduled for transfer to security 
guard school on the remote island of diego garcia in the indian 
ocean but managed to get sent instead to lakehurst nj and 
continue in photography until his release 
blue angels commanding officer cmdr gil rud accused singleton 
of failing to turn the photos over for use by investigators 
immediately after the accident and lying when he claimed the film 
had been lost until after the probe was concluded 
singleton said he found the film four months after the crash 
before singleton left the blue angels ordered him to turn over 
all copies and negatives of the crash photos but his boss in new 
jersey found a set of the crash pictures in singletons portfolio 
singleton said he was reduced in rank as a result

the senate looking to protect the interests 
of 30 million veterans and their dependents today overwhelmingly 
approved legislation creating a cabinetlevel department of 
veterans affairs 
the bill was approved 8411 negotiators will work out technical 
differences between the bill and a version the house passed last 
november just a week after it was recommended by president reagan 
the secretary of veterans affairs would be the 14th cabinet 
secretary and the fifth added since 1960 
voting against elevating the veterans administration to cabinet 
level were sens william armstrong rcolo dan evans rwash 
jake garn rutah gordon humphrey rnh nancy kassebaum 
rkan james mcclure ridaho william proxmire dwis dan 
quayle rind warren rudman rnh alan simpson rwyo and 
steven symms ridaho 
not voting were sens joe biden ddel orrin hatch rutah 
jesse helms rnc paul trible rva and john warner rva 
for the first time the veterans administration will have 
direct access to the president without an intervening party sen 
spark matsunaga dhawaii said monday as the senate debated the 
measure for the first time the secretary of veterans affairs 
will sit in the highest policy councils of the land 
earlier in the day the senate agreed to allow veterans to 
appeal to the courts when their claims for benefits are denied by 
va that measure also would repeal a provision enacted at the end 
of the civil war that prohibits lawyers from charging more than 
10 to press a claim for a veteran 
this bill approved on an 8611 vote has failed four times in 
the house in recent years apparently because of fears that lawyers 
would replace the voluntary organizations including american 
legion and veterans of foreign wars in dealing with va 
nevertheless senate veterans affairs committee chairman alan 
cranston dcalif said i think this time we have enough 
momentum to get this measure approved by the full congress 
the senate governmental affairs committee concluded that 
elevation of va to the cabinet would best serve americas 
veterans the american public and ultimately the president of the 
united states through strengthening of the cabinet as a 
policymaking mechanism 
simpson a former chairman of the committee said he sees no 
rational reason for the bill if anybody believes veterans need a 
stronger voice than they already have then ive missed 
something in the nine years ive been here 
the changes would take effect jan 1 republicans sought to 
allow reagan to name the first secretary immediately even though 
there would be no department to preside over this year that 
proposal was defeated 
va created in 1930 has the third largest work force in the 
federal government exceeded only by the defense department and the 
postal service it has a 28 billion annual budget and 240000 
employees administers almost 90000 patient beds in 534 health 
facilities and last year had 20 million outpatient visits 
the congressional budget office estimates raising the va status 
will cost 33 million over five years 
in giving veterans limited access to the courts to appeal claims 
cases the senate rejected by a 6136 margin a far more restrictive 
amendment by sen frank murkowski of alaska senior republican on 
the veterans affairs committee it would have allowed review only 
of va regulations not of the agencys factual findings about an 
individual veterans claim 
the senatepassed bill would permit a court to overturn an 
adverse finding of fact by the vas board of veterans appeals when 
the court finds the decision so utterly lacking in a rational 
basis in the evidence that a manifest and grievous injustice would 
result if such finding were not set aside 
murkowski argued against the change saying the current system 
works adequately 
does anyone anywhere have evidence that the system is so 
broken that without federal court intervention in thousands of 
individual claims our veterans are going to be deprived of a fair 
shake he asked he cited statistics that the board of veterans 
appeals reverses up to 25 percent of claim denials and said the 
bill would add about 4500 cases a year to the nations backlogged 
courts

many hungry new yorkers scanned the streets in 
vain for hot dogs shish kebabs and ice cream as mayor edward i 
koch began enforcing a 5yearold ban on food vendors on crowded 
city sidewalks 
a special police unit took to the streets monday to see that 
licensed vendors follow the ordinance which limits the time and 
location that food pushcarts may operate but many peddlers had 
already pulled their stands off the sidewalks in protest and said 
they planned to demonstrate at city hall 
demonstrations will have no impact on us none at all said 
the mayor i wouldnt care if they came with 20000 stands to 
city hall it will have no impact 
police said they confiscated four of the polished metal 
pushcarts with colorful umbrellas during the first day of the 
peddler patrol but some 600 carts disappeared from the streets as 
a small group of vendors gathered across from radio city music hall 
to protest 
it means ive got two kids and im out of work now and the 
mayor doesnt give a damn said thomas michaelides whos been 
hawking hot dogs for 25 years like his father before him 
those looking for a cheap lunch found themselves going hungry or 
paying more than theyd like 
i cant afford a 4 sandwich said jane faraci 36 an 
office worker but i can afford a 1 hot dog she sat without a 
meal near rockefeller center sipping the soda she had purchased to 
drink with her lunch 
the mayor admitted the crackdown was a bit of political 
armtwisting to get the city council to pass a new law that would 
allow six vendors chosen by lottery to work each prime street 
block 
but the vendors and city council members have balked at the 
plan resulting in kochs edict to begin enforcing the 1983 law 
which bans vendors from corners in midtown including rockefeller 
center and times square in the wall street area near the united 
nations and in brooklyns fulton street mall 
a spokeswoman for the city council peg breen said the sweep 
was overreacting she said current law prudently enforced 
could reduce sidewalk overcrowding 
the m parpis food distribution co which owns 50 vending 
carts found little help in court to fight the ban 
parpis lawyers argued in manhattans state supreme court that 
the ban is an unreasonable use of the citys regulatory power 
but justice irving kirschenbaum said monday the city was within 
its legal rights five hours later justice ernst h rosenberger of 
the appellate division of state supreme court denied a similar

michael dukakis undoubtedly hopes the selection 
of texas sen lloyd bentsen to be his vice presidential running 
mate will rekindle warm memories of 1960 and become an example of 
history repeating itself 
but dukakis didnt make this choice on nostalgia alone 
geography washington experience and a relatively conservative 
voting record pointed the way to bentsen a fellow who has already 
defeated george bush once 
beyond helping in texas bentsens choice is designed to 
reassure the white male voters across the south who have abandoned 
the democratic party in droves in recent elections and to win over 
the voters who shunned dukakis in many of the primaries across the 
south on super tuesday last march 
the history dukakis hopes to repeat is john f kennedys choice 
of texas sen lyndon johnson a decision that enabled the 
democratic ticket to carry texas and claim the white house in one 
of the closest elections of modern times 
in many ways kennedy is a political model and a hero for 
dukakis who delights in recalling how he and close friend paul 
brountas once traveled across country in a battered car to see the 
son of massachusetts nominated for president in los angeles 28 
years ago 
now more than a quarter century later another son of 
massachusetts is the democratic partys leader and longtime 
sidekick brountas shepherded the selection of a partner for the 
fall campaign 
kennedys brother sen edward m kennedy quickly embraced the 
selection of bentsen saying today the massachusettstexas 
combination got this country moving again in 1960 and it will do 
the same for the nation in 1988 
bushs top campaign aides speak hopefully of a virtual lock on 
southern electoral votes putting 200 to 220 such votes within the 
vice presidents grasp with relative ease 
texas accounts for 29 of those votes and no democrat in this 
century has won the white house without carrying the state this 
will make texas a real battleground said one dukakis campaign 
strategist and indeed it should 
bentsen defeated bush in the state in a 1970 senate race and 
will be on the ballot twice this year under a special law passed 
for johnson in 1960 bentsen can seek reelection to his seat as 
well as run for vice president 
so while bush may yet win the south bentsens selection means 
it wont be easy and the more time bush is forced to spend in the 
south defending his natural political base the less time he has to 
challenge dukakis in california illinois michigan and ohio 
states shaping up as the critical tests in the battle for the white 
house 
bush of course has the luxury of going second in the vice 
presidential selection game he may now choose to maximize his 
chances in california or pick a candidate from one of the 
industrial state battlegrounds thus checking dukakis move he 
could also stake out new territory by choosing a woman for example 
dukakis also balanced the ticket in another way when he selected 
bentsen 
he has been urged repeatedly to select someone who has 
experience in washington and bentsen is the walking embodiment of 
the senate establishment he is chairman of the senate finance 
committee a onetime head of the democratic senatorial committee 
and widely respected by his peers 
but bentsen is no clone of dukakis just as johnson was no clone 
of kennedy he has voted in favor of funding for the contra rebels 
battling the government of nicaragua and his record on civil 
rights will come under scrutiny from the liberals whose support 
also will be needed for dukakis to win the white house 
an early test will come on wednesday when bentsen is expected 
to join dukakis in an appearance before the naacp in washington

peacekeeping force in south lebanon were caught in the crossfire 
today in a battle between israelibacked militiamen and shiite 
moslem guerrillas security sources said 
the sources said they had no immediate word of militia or

said units of the irish battalion manning several positions in 
braachit 15 miles southeast of tyre were pinned down in the 
fighting but no casualties were reported among un troops 
goksel said the fighting broke out at 1 pm when unknown 
elements fired two rocketpropelled grenades at a hilltop 
position manned by the israelibacked south lebanon army near 
braachit 
the israeliallied south lebanon army which mans israels 
selfdesignated security zone along the border has come under 
repeated attack by moslem guerrillas 
goksel said south lebanon army tanks fired 90 rounds into the 
village which lies on the northern edge of the israeli security 
zone 
the sources said five artillery or tank shells a minute were 
hitting the village which has a population of 3000 
the sources said two israeli cobra helicopter gunships later 
attacked the village with machine gun fire 
an irish officer in braachit reached by telephone said most 
of the village has been destroyed 
the security sources said lebanese red cross teams made two 
attempts to enter the village to bring out casualties but were 
driven back by gunfire 
israel established the security zone in south lebanon after it 
withdrew the bulk of its forces from lebanon in 1985 the israelis 
had invaded lebanon three years earlier

the fbi prevented a top officer of an 
international police organization from entering the united states 
because he was believed to be a spy who helped china gain access to 
us intelligence information the los angeles times reported today 
zhu entao a vice president of interpol was to have attended 
the groups executive committee meeting in washington last week 
but was refused a visa to enter the country the newspaper said 
authorities believe zhu played a key role in gathering 
information from larry wutai chin a former cia translator chin 
committed suicide two years ago after being convicted of selling 
classified information to the beijing government 
over a long period chin allegedly turned over volumes of 
topsecret documents revealing the wests assessment of chinas 
strategic military economic and scientific capabilites 
the chin case was considered one of the most severe breaches in 
american intelligence security in recent years 
chiwei zhang press officer for the peoples republic of china 
denounced the barring of zhu as a violation of international 
norms 
however he declined to say what intelligence role zhu plays for 
china 
china retaliated by notifying the us drug enforcement 
administration that it was canceling plans for two chinese 
narcotics agents to attend a dea international training session at 
quantico va in the fall 
government sources told the newspaper that us officials tried 
to downplay their refusal to give zhu a visa by arranging for the 
interpol meeting to take place at the groups paris headquarters 
instead of in washington zhu reportedly attended the paris 
gathering 
richard c stiener chief of interpols us national central 
bureau was too tied up and wont be able to talk about the zhu 
incident spokeswoman beverly r sweatman said 
however she said zhu was elected a delegate at interpols 1985 
general assembly meeting in the united states which means that he 
attended that session 
a us intelligence source told the times the fbi raised 
objections to zhus most recent attempt to enter the country 
because they knew more about him after the chin case than they did 
in 1985

with a victory over george bush the expected republican 
presidential nominee this year

sharpen the nations position in global trade 
he is a southwestern conservative a protestant a silverhaired 
washington insider 
bentsen is the scion of a wealthy landed family from the rio 
grande valley like most texas legislators he has remained loyal 
to the interests of the oil industry although believing in a 
significant role for government in guiding the us economy 
on the negative side bentsen created a furor in february 1987 
when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay 10000 
apiece to join him for breakfast once a month 
the breakfast club called the chairmans council held one 
meeting and was quickly disbanded bentsen returned the money 
collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists 
bentsen served in the house of representatives for six years 
during the late 1940s and 1950s then left washington to make money 
as a businessman in houston 
after a successful business career he decided to run for the 
senate in 1970 and was asked why 
i think people are little bit like ivy they ought to be

democratic party bentsen accused yarborough of supporting the 
violence which occurred during antivietnam war demonstrations at 
the 1968 democratic presidential convention 
in the general election against bush bentsen lost most of the 
minority voters in texas but won big in rural areas and among 
bluecollar democrats 
during his years in the senate bentsen gradually moderated his 
conservative views often voting for a broader federal role on 
social issues and gradually opposing the vietnam war 
we have fulfilled our commitment bentsen said in 1971 
three years before last us combat troops left 
after the fighting stopped he was a prime sponsor of the war 
powers act which seeks to give congress a bigger role in deciding 
whether the united states should be involved in armed conflicts 
overseas 
more recently bentsen moved into a number of posts which made 
him better known nationaly they included a senate campaign 
committee job in which he dispensed tens of thousands of dollars to 
the senate campaigns of democrats

the legislature of nagornokarabakh a largely 
armenian mountain enclave at the heart of a monthslong ethnic 
dispute voted today to secede from the republic of azerbaijan and 
join armenia reporters in the area said 
reporters for the radio station in nagornokarabakhs main city 
stepanakert read a statement by telephone saying the regions 
lawmakers had taken the bold step at a meeting today 
the soviet of peoples deputies of the nagornokarabakh 
autonomous region declares its secession from the azerbaijan soviet 
socialist republic the statement said 
it said the legislature had voted with only one abstention to 
secede and rename the region the artsakh autonomous oblast of the 
neighboring republic of armenia 
the legal standing of the decision which defies central 
authorities all the way up to soviet communist party general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev is unclear 
the soviet constitution says any proposed territorial change 
must be approved by the republic affected azerbaijans parliament 
rejected nagornokarabakhs earlier request to join armenia on june 
17 
armenians who are mainly christian consider nagornokarabakh 
to be part of their ancient homeland but it was incorporated into 
mostly moslem azerbaijan in 1923 the dispute erupted in strikes 
and street demonstrations by armenians in nagornokarabakh and 
armenia itself in february 
gorbachev said at the communist party conference june 28 that it 
was time to widen the powers of the countrys 15 union republics 
the autonomous republics and other ethnic entities 
but he said some ethnic minorities were going too far 
some think that any questions from the redrawing of borders 
to the establishment of opposition parties can be resolved 
through glasnost or greater openness gorbachev said 
the central committee believes such abuses of democratization 
run counter to the task of perestroika contradict the peoples 
interests gorbachev said perestroika is gorbachevs 
wideranging program to restructure soviet society 
nagornokarabakhs legislature had voted feb 20 to request the 
transfer but todays decision amounted to a unilateral declaration 
of secession 
the nagornokarabakh legislature had proposed a compromise on 
june 21 saying the area could be turned over temporarily to the 
central government in moscow while a longerterm solution was 
sought 
the communist party newspaper pravda said today that most 
armenians have decided to return to work and quit a weeklong 
general strike in their capital yerevan 
the walkout began july 4 and virtually paralyzed yerevan and 
other parts of the armenian republic armenians are demanding the 
annexation of nagornokarabakh 
pravda quoted local party leaders as saying 195 out of the 231 
industrial enterprises in yerevan were operating at full volume 
monday it said 31 others were partially operating and five 
remained shut 
of the citys 1249 streetcars trolleybuses and buses only 170 
did not operate pravda said 
however dissident journalist mofses gorgisyan a resident of 
the republic said the walkout was gaining strength and that on 
monday factory representatives reported 70 percent absenteeism he 
said troops and tanks were deployed on the outskirts of yerevan 
and militia were patrolling within city 
gorgisyan said 300000400000 people gathered outside armenias 
institute of ancient manuscripts on monday to drum up support for 
the strike a reporter for the republics staterun news agency 
armenpress who declined to give his name put the number of 
demonstrators at about 100000 
gorgisyan 27 is a member of an underground group called the 
alliance for national selfdetermination and publisher of an 
underground journal called fatherland 
many armenians decided to return to their jobs because of 
appeals by prominent cultural figures at a demonstration sunday 
who asked them to use other means of protest said a yerevan 
resident contacted monday by telephone 
they suggested meetings open statements but not strikes 
said the resident who identified himself as a television reporter 
but declined to give his name 
the government daily izvestia said hundreds of thousands of 
people attended sundays rally and that some speakers harshly 
criticized armenian delegates to the june 28july 1 communist party 
conference in moscow for not defending national interests 
resolutions adopted at the conference did not mention the 
nagornokarabakh dispute 
ethnic rioting sparked by the territorial dispute broke out in 
the azerbaijan port of sumgait in february and officials said 32 
people were killed including 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis

geraldine ferraro who four years ago became 
the first woman on a major partys national ticket said today she 
was delighted with michael dukakis plans to name texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as his democratic running mate 
she said that had there been enough women in political office to 
provide dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate she 
would have been disappointed at his choice of a man 
but because we dont have a woman in that spot i am not 
disappointed she said in a telephone interview from new york 
ms ferraro part of the losing democratic ticket with walter 
mondale in 1984 said bentsen has been fine on issues that i and 
many women care about and in addition to that hes going to be a 
very strong help to the ticket rounding it out beautifully so that 
with a democrat in the white house its going to make a difference 
for the women in this country 
im delighted i think its an indication that governor 
dukakis intends to run a strong national campaign i think hes 
going to go down south and seriously battle the republicans for 
those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing 
this country she said 
earlier ms ferraro told usa today that there were not enough 
women in positions from which national offices are traditionally 
chosen the us senate congress and statehouses to provide 
dukakis with a good choice she said no women currently in elected 
office meet dukakis need of a candidate strong on foreign policy 
experience who will also give him geographic balance 
she said jesse jackson does not have those credentials that 
politically michael dukakis needs in his vice president 
had i not been a woman and im the first one to say it i 
probably would not have been chosen she told the newspaper in 
1984 it was time to remove this final barrier from womens 
achieving political power

said enough already were going to let everybody have a chance 
to participate thats a big thing nobody can take away she

crude oil prices dropped sharply for the second 
straight day today tumbling toward the 14abarrel level in 
reaction to fears of a relentless supply glut and opecs failure to 
restrain output 
on the new york mercantile exchange a sensitive barometer of 
price trends the augustdelivery price for west texas intermediate 
was 1449 a barrel by midday down 29 cents from the 20month 
closing low of 1478 set monday 
the market is awash in crude and the focus has returned to 
that said chris mccormack an energy futures trader with the new 
york investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc the market just 
looks extremely bearish 
the decline monday erased gains made last week which were based 
on fears of supply disruptions caused by a major oil platform 
explosion in the north sea 
refined products traded on the exchange also fell sharply 
although not as steeply as crude wholesale heating oil for august 
delivery fell 206 cents a gallon to 4133 cents while wholesale 
unleaded gasoline fell 104 cents a gallon to 5213 cents 
at one point during the day crude prices rose briefly on a news 
report that the pricemonitoring committee of the 13member 
organization of petroleum exporting countries might confer soon 
opecs official news agency said the meeting might be held after 
the cartels general secretary indonesias subroto met with 
officials of the united arab emirates for talks concerning the 
current oil market situation output cheating by members of the 
cartel has weakened the market seriously recently making opecs 
18perbarrel target price more remote than ever the united arab 
emirates has been mentioned as a significant violator 
said edward ryan a trader at dean witter reynolds incs energy 
futures unit crude has gotten down to a supplydemand scenario 
theres simply too much i think the market needs to see something 
of substance the rhetoric of opec is ridiculous every trader 
considers it ridiculous 
by some analyst reckonings the cartel now is pumping as much as 
188 million barrels a day more than 3 million barrels a day over 
its official ceiling of 1506 million barrels

farm senators unveiled a legislative blueprint 
today for payments of up to 100000 to prevent heat and lack of 
rain from driving crop and livestock producers off their 
droughtstricken land 
were not going to see their lives as farmers and ranchers end 
this year because of a freak of nature declared agriculture 
committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt as he unveiled the 
measure in a senate floor speech 
but leahy sounded a cautionary note concerning the bills 
timetable 
this legislation will move as quickly through the committee 
and the senate as the members want it to move he said echoing 
statements monday that reckless speed with the legislation would be 
a mistake 
farmers and ranchers also realize that if we were to try some 
politically expedient zipthrough piece of legislation a lot of 
them are going to be left out he told reporters monday at the 
white house 
farm lawmakers emerged from a meeting with president reagan 
saying no snags have appeared to slow action on the relief bill 
calling for federal disaster payments of up to 100000 for 
droughtstricken crop producers 
they said agriculture secretary richard e lyng told the 
president that the measure which would cancel a 50cent cut in 
dairy prices is shaping up as a pretty good piece of 
legislation 
lyng said thursday that the need for a bill is now urgent 
and house speaker jim wright dtexas said monday that he wanted 
floor action this week 
i dont think anybody should put artificial deadlines on it 
leahy said the important thing is that you tell people about to 
go bankrupt that there is hope that there will be planting and 
raising herds next year 
as sketched by congressional sources both house and senate 
bills would provide disaster payments for droughtstricken 
producers of those crops covered by federal farm programs and those 
that are not payments would amount to 65 percent of predrought 
expected earnings whether from target prices pricesupport loans 
or market prices 
but they would apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of 
the crop any deficiency payments income supports provided by the 
agriculture department would be deducted from the disaster 
payments and there would be an array of other limitations no 
individual would be able to receive more than 100000 under the 
legislation 
for example a corn producer would receive a disaster payment of 
65 percent of the target price of 293 a bushel or 190 a bushel 
multiplied by the amount of his loss in excess of 35 percent of the 
historical yield he has established with the agriculture department 
a farmer with 100 acres planted in corn under the program and a 
100bushel expected yield would receive a disaster payment of 
12350 under the legislation if his entire crop were wiped out 
for livestock producers a number of programs already in effect 
would be restructured to take in all types of food animals the 
bill also would allow the secretary of agriculture to depart from 
current practice and provide such assistance to farmers who do not 
grow their own feed 
blazing sun and lack of rainfall have scorched hay across much 
of the farm belt and livestock feed is now at a premium cattlemen 
are complaining that they are obliged to rush to market with their 
herds for lack of feed 
under the bill farmers would be allowed to plant soybeans and 
sunflowers on 10 percent to 35 percent of a farms program acreage 
without losing the historical wheat feed grain cotton and rice 
bases they have established with the agriculture department for 
purposes of taking part in farm programs 
there have been forecasts of a squeeze in soybeans supplies 
because of the drought and prices already are high

vice president george bush wooing votes at 
the naacp convention promised today to have a positive civil 
rights agenda and paid tribute to jesse jackson for running the 
race for being heard 
in an appearance before several thousand people at the 79th 
convention of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people bush did not mention reports of michael dukakis 
plans to name texas sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate on the 
democratic ticket 
bush delivering his speech beneath a banner proclaiming 
vote be heard got a warm reception from the audience he said 
he wanted to be heard because i do not intend to concede the vote 
of any american 
the vice president certain to be the republican presidential 
nominee said a bush administration would mark a new day from 
the reagan administration 
i will have a positive civil rights agenda he pledged 
i guarantee you i will be personally involved in protecting 
the civil rights of all americans bush said this effort will 
be at the top of the agenda of my attorney general and he or she 
will be directly accountable to me for results 
the audience applauded loudly 
bush also said he had known jackson the runnerup in the 
democratic primaries for a long time in a friendly personal way 
and i dont have to cover up the differences i have profound 
differences with jesse on many of these issues but i salute him 
for running the race for being heard and he deserves a salute 
from us bush said again drawing loud applause from the audience 
the vice president readily acknowledged that republicans since 
the days of president franklin d roosevelt have not been able to 
win much of the black vote 
however he pledged that if elected president his decisions 
will not depend on getting a certain percentage of the black 
vote i want to do what is fair i want to do what is right and i 
want to do what is principled 
bush promised that regardless of the black vote he gets you 
will be heard i promise you that you are going to be called on 
you are going to be partners in my presidency 
jackson is to address the convention tonight and dukakis is to 
speak before it on wednesday 
while the reagan administration has been criticized as being 
insensitive to blacks bush has a good relationship with some black 
leaders and has promised that a bush administration would have a 
positive civil rights agenda 
by a significant margin blacks voted for democrats walter 
mondale in 1984 and jimmy carter in 1980 rather than the 
reaganbush ticket however in opening the naacp convention 
benjamin hooks the groups executive director said it would be a 
fatal mistake for democrats to assume they have the black vote 
wrapped up 
the naacp is the third special interest group that bush has 
courted this week following an appearance sunday before 
lithuanians and before a group of farm writers editors and 
broadcasters on monday 
responding to a question from the audience at the agricultural 
communicators congress meeting in washington bush said he might 
consider senate republican leader bob dole or any of the other 
contenders in the republican primary race as a running mate 
the vice president said dole of kansas was deservedly popular 
in agricultural america he knows a great deal about it 
but i just dont want to start going through long lists or 
short lists of candidates because believe me at this juncture 
we dont have them bush said 
i will say this about bob dole he and i went head on head 
bush added so did pat robertson and al haig and pete du pont and 
jack kemp 
my party has never been more unified going into a republican 
convention than we are right now thanks to the way bob dole and the 
others have been conducting themselves and their sense of 
advocacy bush said so the fact you ran against somebody 
certainly in my view would not preclude consideration of that 
person 
outlining factors that will influence his decision bush said 
the fundamental criteria will be who man or woman is best 
qualified to take over if something happens to the president 
i would want a certain philosophical compatability to be 
there he said then i will do what all politicians do throw 
a little bit of seasoning in there for geography however bush 
said that factor was not important as it has been 
ill look who the democrats pick and then we will have 
procedures for selecting and they will be getting soliciting 
opinion from the senators the republicans and members of the 
republican national committeee and congressmen and governors and 
all of that 
and that will probably be done by the republican national 
committee bush said sometimes thats been done in the past 
and then i will make a very personal decision he added 
in a speech that he billed as nonpartisan bush nevertheless 
took several jabs at dukakis saying i am not the one who feels 
that the problems of agricultural america can be solved by planting 
more belgian endive 
he also said a bush administration would help farmers export 
more crops not force farmers to produce less that is the major 
difference

public order minister anastasios sehiotis 
today released pictures of three men allegedly involved in a 
terrorist attack aboard a greek cruise ship that left 11 people 
dead and 98 injured 
government sources said today that a woman also was involved in 
mondays attack and was photographed on the ship her photograph 
was not made public by sehiotis but also was being distributed to 
airports border entry points and harbors around greece said the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
authorities had said three men hurled grenades and fired 
automatic weapons monday at terrified passengers aboard the city of 
poros cruise ship police said the assailants fled in a speedboat 
greek authorities speculated the attack was part of a failed 
attempt by proiranian arab terrorists to hijack foreign tourists 
taking a islandhopping cruise on the greekowned ship 
there was no claim of responsibility for the assault at least 
one passenger said a gunman spoke what sounded like arabic 
sehiotis indicated the ship attack was linked to an explosion 
earlier monday that killed two men in a rental car near the 
trocadero marina home marina for the city of poros 
despite repeated questioning by greek reporters the minister 
declined to give any more details other than the names of two 
lebanese men being sought as involved in this attack 
he identified them as hamoud abdul hamid 36 of lebanon who 
rented the car and mohammed zozad 21 thought to be one of the 
terrorists on the ship the minister said both had been in greece 
since may 
a piraeus harbor authority officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he believed the attack was staged by two men and 
two women who boarded the cruise ship after it stopped at the 
island of aegina 
he said survivors had recognized zozad in the picture as well as 
a young woman in another photograph taken aboard the ship he did 
not say if a picture was taken of the other woman or if the picture 
of the other man was the same as that released by greek officials 
rescuers today pulled a body from the aegean sea and a second 
was found on the cruise ship nine bodies were recovered earlier 
and officials said the casualty count was expected to keep rising 
we also have found some floating body remains that indicate 
the death toll could go higher said a harbor authority officer 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the ship attack occurred at 840 am six hours after an 
explosivespacked car blew up near the trocadero marina police 
said 
police said they found an iranian magazine in the wrecked car 
they said the vehicle contained hand grenades and automatic weapons 
terrified passengers scurried for cover and leaped into the sea 
when the gunmen hurled grenades and sprayed gunfire at the tourists 
on the crowded vessel the grenade blasts started a fire and a deck 
collapsed aboard the ship 
the ship about 16 miles out was returning to the trocadero 
marina in the athens port of piraeus from a daylong cruise 
although the harbor authority reported some bodies may have not 
been recovered a merchant marine ministry spokesman said all 471 
passengers and 22 crew members had been accounted for today 
the ministry said that 28 of the 98 originally reported as 
wounded remained hospitalized today 
by today authorities had released the names of only two of the 
dead antonis demaizis the ships 45yearold first mate and a 
danish tourist 33yearold karl johan grabas 
i was on deck when i heard automatic fire jean wogewda of 
lorient france said from his bed in a piraeus hospital where he 
was recovering from gunshot wounds in both legs i turned around 
and was thrown into the air by the impact of the bullets hitting my 
leg 
another french passenger andre gelia told reporters that a 
thin man in white with a dark complexion and dark hair jumped up 
from his seat and started yelling in what sounded like arabic 
gelia said the gunman took a submachine gun out of his backpack 
and fired it at passengers then he said a few more words in 
arabic took out one or two hand grenades out of the backpack and 
tossed them thats all i remember gelia said 
pouring black smoke the city of poros steamed back to piraeus 
the ministry spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the wounded included 34 french 3 jordanians 3 danes 2 
britons 2 norwegians 1 moroccan 1 swiss and 1 swede 
seven americans were on the cruise but none were among the 
injured he said 
the ministry spokesman said the ship attack could be linked with 
a trial starting in greece on wednesday of a palestinian wanted in 
the united states for allegedly bombing a pan am jetliner over 
hawaii in 1982 a japanese teenager died in the blast and 15 
people were injured 
the palestinian mohammed rashid was arrested at athens airport 
last month he is to be tried on charges of entering greece on a 
false passport but the government has said it will consider a us 
request for his extradition 
in october 1985 palestinian terrorists hijacked the italian 
cruise ship achille lauro during a mediterranean cruise they 
killed a 69yearold american passenger leon klinghoffer seven 
palestinians were convicted in the attack

defense and foreign policy and washington experience all 
considered crucial to a democratic victory in florida 
even backers of jesse jackson who came in second to dukakis in 
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of 
those the massachusetts governor had considered for the second 
spot seemed satisfied with bentsen 
florida state rep james burke who was the state campaign 
coordinator for jackson said we would have preferred to have 
had jesse he added though that bentsen is a better choice 
than some of the others he could have picked 
john white a former democratic national chairman who has been 
advising jackson said he was excited about the choice of 
bentsen and said it would make texas a hell of a battlefield 
union activists also praised bentsen saying that the texas 
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with 
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and 
layoff notices some of labors top legislative priorities this 
year 
bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two 
plant closing notices and the trade bill were compatible said 
robert mcglotten legislative director for the aflcio and he 
let his colleagues know how he felt 
geraldine ferraro who four years ago was picked as democrat 
walter mondales running mate said she was delighted at the 
choice of bentsen 
i think its an indication that governor dukakis intends to 
run a strong national campaign ms ferraro said 
on the republican side senate minority leader bob dole of 
kansas frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on bushs 
ticket said he thought dukakis couldnt have picked a better 
man 
rep lynn martin rill who is national cochairwoman of 
bushs presidential campaign called bentsen a nice man whos 
able but said she still anticipated that bush would be able to 
carry texas 
on the similarity to the kennedyjohnson ticket of 1960 she 
said im sure were going to hear 1960 ad nauseum theres a 
slight difference of course he bentsen was not selected by his 
peers to be in leadership as lyndon johnson the senate majority 
leader had been nor is dukakis john kennedy

he is taller and leaner but the hand and facial gestures some 
of his rhetorical flourishes and even his tone of voice are almost 
identical to his fathers 
party officials believe the begin name on likuds list could 
help it win what promises to be a close contest with the 
centerleft labor party of foreign minister shimon peres for 
control of the knesset the 120seat parliament 
in an interview with the associated press benny begin insisted 
he cannot fill his fathers shoes 
it is unreasonable to hang hopes on me because my name is 
begin he said people like him are born very rarely 
begin said he sees little chance for territorial compromise or a 
peace agreement with neighboring jordan so believes like his 
father that israel should keep control of the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
i am not a prophet of doom he said with a smile i look 
at all the alternatives and seek the lesser evil the one that 
doesnt endanger israels survival which means maintaining 
absolute israeli control over the land of israel west of the jordan 
river 
menachem begin 74 was born in poland his mix of charm and 
fiery rhetoric proved a winning formula for ending three decades of 
labor party government in 1977 
in 1978 he shared the nobel peace prize with the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat for the process leading to their peace treaty 
the next year then resigned suddenly in 1983 and has been a 
recluse since 
associates and friends said begin resigned because he was 
depressed about israels loss of more than 650 soldiers in the 
invasion of lebanon which began under his leadership in 1982 
benny begin refuses to speak about his father except to say 
hes feeling fine thank you and acknowledge the former prime 
minister as the source of his political aspirations 
when interviewed during a party meeting at a country club in 
herzliya a seaside town the younger begin focused on his own 
political views he delivered them with the same rhetorical style 
and sense of jewish history as his father pausing occasionally to 
sip grapefruit juice from a can or shake hands with wellwishers 
he condemned the 7monthold palestinian rebellion in the west 
bank and gaza which israel has occupied since capturing them from 
jordan and egypt in the 1967 war 
the arabs call it the intefadeh or uprising but they are 
simply riots he said thats what they should be called it is 
clear that this is a new method to carry out an old goal of the 
arab nation to expel the jews from the land of israel 
benny begin characterized tough army measures used to quell arab 
unrest as reasonable force and disputed the labor partys 
contention that a political process would resolve the conflict 
there is no political solution he said and a palestinian 
state in the occupied territories would be another terrorist 
state between libya and syria which would try to take over all of 
israel 
as long as the arab nation doesnt relinquish its plan to 
destroy the land of israel there will unfortunately be no peaceful 
solution begin declared 
the son was born in israel and unlike his father rarely 
invokes the nazi holocaust as a rationale for his political views 
he also is more softspoken 
he has a doctorate in geology from colorado state university and 
for the past decade has been studying the viability of building a 
nuclear power plant in the negev desert begin said his role was to 
determine the risk of an earthquake in the area that could cause a 
nuclear disaster 
benny begin has four daughters and two sons aged eight to 23 
his wife ruth 45 is a social worker for the defense ministry who 
deals with people wounded in israels wars

president reagan today picked a toughminded 
crime buster former pennsylvania gov richard l thornburgh to 
succeed edwin meese iii as attorney general 
thornburgh a squeaky clean exprosecutor with a reputation for 
staying cool under fire declined comment on the troubles of meese 
who has been dogged by questions about his ethics and who announced 
last week that he had been exonerated by a special prosecutor and 
would leave office aug 1 
thornburgh said i think it is important to look forward 
rather than back i think what we will try to do is to carry out a 
fullbore effort in the law enforcement area 
asked if he would have to look into investigations of meese 
thornburgh at first declined to answer then added my intention 
in this as in any areas is to follow the evidence wherever it may 
lead 
meese could still face an internal department review of his 
actions 
reagan who appeared with thornburgh in the white house briefing 
room called thornburgh the ideal choice for attorney general 
i urge the senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as 
our other justice department nominees so they can roll up their 
sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land 
also awaiting senate confirmation are the deputy attorney 
general harold christensen the no 3 person in the department 
associate attorney general francis keating and the criminal 
division chief edward dennis 
christensen and dennis have been on the job since early june 
keating has been at work about a month longer all were appointed 
on an acting basis by reagan 
there appeared to little opposition in the senate to the 
nomination 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts the no 2 demcorat on 
the senate judiciary committee which will review thornburghs 
nomination said he expected a rapid confirmation 
i have the greatest respect for dick thornburgh kennedy 
said the state of justice in america would be very different 
today if dick thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3 
years instead of ed meese 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the panels ranking 
republican priaded thornburghs deep intellect and unmatched 
integrity 
senate republican leader bob dole proclaimed thornburgh a 
tough man for a tough job and said the selection deserves 
speedy senate confirmation 
reagan told reporters that thornburgh was a prosecutors 
prosecutor for six years as a united states attorney for western 
pennsylvania a toughminded crime buster winning an unprecedented 
number of convictions for corruption and against members of 
organized crime 
reagan said that as governor for eight years thornburgh won 
tough mandatory jail terms for violent and repeat criminals he was 
in the forefront of the war against drugs cracking down on drug 
traffickers and creating preventive eduction programs for 
pennsylvania school children 
news of the nomination cheered officials with vice president 
george bushs presidential campaign who had worried aloud about 
political damage to the certain republican nominee from the 
persistent questions over meeses ethics 
thornburgh 55 earned a reputation for methodical steady 
leadership in 1979 when after only 72 days as governor he was 
faced with the nations worst commercial nuclear accident at three 
mile island near harrisburg 
six years later he said he learned several lessons from the 
accident they included forget partisanship during crises dont 
be afraid to scramble the organization chart and respect but 
do not depend on the news media 
but it is thornburghs ability as a prosecutor that set him 
apart from other attorney general candidates according to several 
of his former aides as us attorney for western pennsylvania 
thornburghs attacks on organized cime public corruption and drug 
trafficking led to his 1975 appointment by president ford as 
assistant attorney general in charge of the justice departments 
criminal division 
at the justice department thornburgh credits himself in a 
biography with enhancing the effort to combat organized crime and 
public corruption nationwide as a prosecutor his targets 
included a us customs agent a county sheriff and a former gop 
congressman j irving whalley who was convicted in a kickback 
case 
thornburghs calm handling of the tmi nuclear plant accident was 
recalled monday by sen alan k simpson rwyo a member of the 
senate judiciary committee 
i saw him handle that with maturity and skill he dealt 
honestly with the issue without emotion or hysteria he has a fine 
grasp of government simpson said 
barred by law from seeking a third term as governor thornburgh 
left pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the institute of 
politics at harvard universitys kennedy school of government 
in the last several days republican sens john heinz and arlen 
specter of pennsylvania and others familiar with thornburgh have 
been questioned about him by white house officials a former 
thornburgh aide speaking on condition of anonymity told of being 
asked about thornburghs views on abortion and replying that those 
views were not incompatible with the administrations 
thornburgh vetoed an antiabortion bill in 1981 saying it was 
excessively restrictive but later signed a weakened version of the 
measure 
as governor thornburgh frequently testified on capitol hill on 
behalf of the presidents proposal for lineitem veto power and a 
constitutional amendment to balance the budget 
he turned down earlier offers from the reagan white house to 
head the fbi and agency for international development thornburgh 
had also been mentioned as a possible running mate for bush 
meese has been under fire since his arrival in washington over a 
succession of ethical questions he announced his decision to leave 
the justice department on the same day last week that independent 
counsel james mckay wound up a 14month criminal investigation of 
the attorney general 
mckay declined to prosecute but portions of his sealed report 
on the investigation reportedly question meeses candor and ethics

a white antiapartheid 
coalition said tuesday it would not adopt the election boycott 
strategy of black activists and instead would try to elect 
prointegration candidates in municipal elections 
the five freedoms forum which represents 25 human rights and 
religious groups said the focus of its campaign would be to elect 
an antiapartheid municipal council in johannesburg the countrys 
largest city 
segregated elections for councils in white black mixedrace 
and asian communities are scheduled nationwide for oct 26 the 
first time voters of all races will go to the polls on the same day 
the government has outlawed public calls for an election 
boycott but black activists have said they oppose participation in 
any elections until south africas 26 million blacks are given 
voting rights on the national level 
prominent antiapartheid clergymen two weeks ago defied the 
government ban and urged south africans not to vote in october 
the five freedoms forum in a statement said it was not 
criticizing those who favored a boycott of the elections 
the johannesburg city council as a whitesonly body is a 
structure infected with the racism implicit in the governments 
apartheid policy the statement said however despite the 
inadequacy of these structures we do not believe that any purpose 
would be served by calling on whites to boycott 
the statement said the elections could be used as a vehicle for 
campaigning against apartheid laws such as the group areas act 
which establishes racially segregated residential districts 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a segregated society in 
which the blacks have no vote in national affairs controlled by 
the 5 million whites 
the government is spending more than 2 million on an 
advertising campaign to promote participation in the elections 
officials of transvaal province which includes johannesburg and 
pretoria on tuesday called on employers to help their black 
workers register to vote by obtaining forms that could be filled 
out at workplaces

superpower arms talks resumed tuesday after a 
sevenweek break and the chief us negotiator played down hopes 
for a breakthrough on a treaty slashing longrange nuclear arsenals 
disagreement at the negotiations which began in march 1985 
centers on us plans for a spacebased missile defense and soviet 
insistence on limiting sealaunched cruise missiles many 
anticheating provisions also remain open in a draft agreement of 
more than 300 pages 
us and soviet teams held a twohour plenary meeting at the 
us mission to launch the 10th round of talks for which no end 
has been set the talks had recessed for the moscow summit 
a source close to the talks who demanded anonymity called the 
initial twohour session productive but declined to say if new 
proposals were made some interesting things were said the 
source said refusing to elaborate 
before the opening session chief us negotiator max kampelman 
reaffirmed washingtons stand that the draft pact halving each 
sides strategic stockpile should not be held hostage to limits 
sought by moscow on president reagans missile defense program the 
strategic defense initiative 
asked whether a possible fifth superpower summit or the end of 
reagans presidency in january could be target dates for agreement 
kampelman said talks will continue no matter who is president and 
no matter who the leader of the soviet union is 
i dont think important issues should be governed by the 
calendar he told reporters before the opening session if it 
takes longer fine if it takes shorter fine 
kampelman said on monday that an agreement was still possible 
under the reagan administration he and his top two aides were to 
brief nato allies on wednesday in brussels on the start of the 
talks the negotiations are to continue wednesday or thursday the 
us side said 
at the may 29june 2 summit in moscow reagan and general 
secretary mikhail s gorbachev ordered negotiators to continue 
energetically and purposefully after the two leaders made only 
limited progress on arms control 
kampelman told reporters monday dont look for drama were 
at a stage now where hard work is required rather than drama 
soviet chief delegate alexei obukhov said on sunday the talks 
must not lose momentum 
both said the talks have come a long way but kampelman noted 
much still remains to be resolved 
washington and moscow agree the proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty should cut each sides stocks over seven years to 
an overall limit of 6000 nuclear warheads and 1600 launchers 
such as heavy bombers and landbased intercontinental missiles 
some details of monitoring compliance are also set 
but obukhov said progress was imperative on a renewed 
ussoviet commitment to the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
which moscow says is threatened by strategic defense initiative 
also known as sdi 
reagan says sdi does not violate the abm pact and kampelman 
reaffirmed the us side will not allow moscow to use these 
negotiations to have us end our strategic defense initiative 
the geneva negotiators have yet to agree on a joint text 
pledging each side to observe the abm treaty for a certain period 
obukhov also pressed for limits on longrange sealaunched 
cruise missiles and verification measures including inspections of 
warships 
washington has balked saying the weapons cannot be reliably 
detected us start negotiator steven hanmer called soviet 
verification proposals totally impractical and said current 
prospects for resolving the issue are dim

one of three vials that washed ashore last 
week on new york beaches contained human blood infected with the 
aids virus state health commissioner dr david axelrod said today 
axelrod said the sample discovered on lido beach about 20 miles 
east of new york city also tested positive for hepatitis at the 
state health department laboratory in albany 
another vial found on a beach about 40 miles east of the city 
contained blood that tested both positive and negative for the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome axelrod said 
a third vial tested negative the health commissioner said 
axelrod said the chances of beachgoers getting infected with the 
aids virus or hepatitis by either stepping on the vials and being 
cut by broken glass or from blood spilled on the beach or in the 
water are remote 
neither virus can survive for long outside the human body and 
the sample that tested positive for the aids virus is believed to 
be inactive 
the conditions to which the infected samples were exposed 
almost certainly destroyed most if not all the active virus 
axelrod said 
while the results confirm some of our fears about the danger 
of the material that washed up on long island beaches axelrod said 
we do not feel the presence of these materials represent a 
significant public health hazard 
axelrod said investigators do not yet know where the vials 
originated or how long they were in the water but the commissioner 
said they are of a design that is clearly associated with the 
medical establishment 
the vials could have come from a doctors office medical 
research facility or a hospital he said 
the discovery of blood samples and other medical debris 
temporarily closed some of long islands most popular beaches late 
last week in the midst of a prolonged heat wave when the beaches 
reopened over the weekend attendance was cut in half in many 
places 
as of today all beaches on long island and in new york city 
were open except for a 14mile stretch of staten islands midland 
beach

police attacked and arrested steel workers 
who threatened to strike during mikhail s gorbachevs visit and 
today surrounded a church where some workers took refuge 
opposition activists said 
a government spokesman confirmed a conflictprone situation 
at the church and said at least one person was temporarily 
detained after the incident monday night in the southeastern city 
of stalowa wola but he denied any organized police attack 
ewa tomaszewska a spokesman for the banned solidarity trade 
union movement said an undetermined number of people were detained 
we suspect that the action is an act of revenge for a rally

human rights for solidarity 
about 50 people retreated into the grounds of the church said 
romaszewski and tomaszewska about a dozen remained there today

phone call from the church 
police in poland rarely enter church grounds to make detentions 
conflictprone situations did arise there yesterday but i 
can say that there were no major disturbances said a government 
press spokesman ryszard strauss 
but he added i cannot say that not a single policeman used 
his truncheon because i was not there 
there was no effect on work at the stalowa wola steel mill 
where the workers are employed he said 
strauss said police moved in when members of the solidarity 
committee of the mill attempted to launch a rally outside the 
church he denied a report that riot police were involved and said 
only normal patrols were continuing at the church tuesday 
a strike occurred at the mill april 2930 during polands worst 
wave of labor unrest since the december 1981 military crackdown 
that stifled solidarity 
about 4000 stalowa wola workers were reported by solidarity 
spokesmen to have rallied thursday to demand reinstatement of seven

in an electionyear bow to an agency that 
serves onethird of all americans the senate voted tuesday to give 
the veterans administration a seat in the presidents cabinet 
the bill was passed by an 8411 vote the house approved similar 
legislation last november a week after the idea was advanced by 
president reagan negotiators from the the senate and house will 
work out minor differences between the two bills 
the department of veterans affairs would become the 14th in the 
cabinet and the fifth addition since 1960 the change would take 
effect jan 1 1989 
sponsors said veterans and their dependents deserve to be heard 
in the highest councils of government opponents called the bill 
another example of congressional pandering to special interests 
in recent years the va has frequently been relegated to a 
relatively insignificant role within the executive branch with the 
administrator having little or no access to the president or other 
top officials in the white house said sen alan cranston 
dcalif chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee 
sen strom thurmond rsc who has been promoting a veterans 
department since 1975 said his support is not aimed at getting 
more money for veterans given the nature and scope of the va it 
is appropriate that we make it an executive department to 
ensure that these federal dollars are more effectively 
administered 
sen alan simpson rwyo a former veterans committee chairman 
opposed creation of the cabinet seat he bitterly criticized some 
veterans service organizations for supporting the bill while they 
fought another measure passed monday by the senate that would 
allow courts to overturn some va decisions on veterans benefits 
if anybody believes veterans needed a stronger voice than 
they already have then ive missed something in the nine years 
ive been year simpson said 
sen gordon humphrey rnh called the bill absurd 
silly goofy illogical irresponsible this is rubbish 
this is unprincipled prostitution after specialinterest groups 
according to the veterans affairs committee va serves 27 
million veterans and 49 million dependents or survivors with a 
budget of 30 billion making it the largest independent federal 
agency it will dispense 14 billion in income maintenance and 626 
million for education and rehabilitation assistance this year 
the agency and its 240000 employees administered 90000 patient 
beds in 534 health facilities and will see 20 million outpatients 
this year it runs 109 national cemeteries and will bury 300000 
veterans this year 
the congressional budget office estimated that converting the va 
into a cabinet department would cost 33 million over five years 
the biggest part of the cost would go for changing signs on va 
buildings 
the bill would reorganize va operations and allow the secretary 
of veterans affairs to name up to four assistant secretaries and 
15 deputy assistants the legislation requires that the top 
operating officers the chief medical director and chief benefits 
director be selected on the basic of expertise and without regard 
to politics 
voting against elevating va to the cabinet were sens william 
armstrong rcolo dan evans rwash jake garn rutah 
humphrey nancy kassebaum rkan james mcclure ridaho william 
proxmire dwis dan quayle rind warren rudman rnh

the us government appreciates the initiative taken by 
vietnam to repatriate these remains and hopes it represents just 
one of many continued steps to resolve this longstanding 
humanitarian issue a us embassy statement said 
the shipment of remains will be the fifth since retired gen 
john w vessey acting as a special presidential envoy reached an 
agreement in hanoi in august under which vietnam agreed to speed up 
the search for remains 
in return washington sent several medical teams to explore how 
private us agencies could help vietnamese including veterans 
disabled in the war against the united states washington doesnt 
give official aid because of vietnams military occupation of 
cambodia 
about 58000 americans lost their lives before us forces 
withdrew from south vietnam in 1973 the north vietnamese 
communists won the war in a lightning offensive in april 1975 
the last shipment of remains on april 6 was the largest ever 
vietnam returned 27 sets of remains it tentatively identified as 
those of americans and three other sets which it said were those 
of ethnic asians who might possibly be among the missing americans 
vietnam has returned more than 150 sets of remains that have 
been confirmed as those of americans the lack of diplomatic 
relations with the united states has hindered progress and 1761 
americans remain unaccounted for

the united states has proposed to the soviet 
union a review be held soon of the 1972 treaty that restricts the 
two superpowers defenses against ballistic missiles but moscow 
has not replied a us official said tuesday 
the review would set the stage for a decision by president 
reagan on whether to scrap the accord considered a main pillar of 
arms control efforts and a restraint on his quest for a spacebased 
defense against soviet rockets 
the treaty states that a review conference be held every five 
years the us proposal is that it be held in geneva beginning on 
friday or next monday said the us official who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
since the soviets have not replied yet it is unlikely to be 
held that quickly even if the response is favorable the official 
said 
in the meantime reagan has to decide whether the soviets 
phasedarray radar station at krasnoyarsk is a material breach 
of the treaty his senior advisers discussed the issue at an 
unpublicized meeting last week of the national security planning 
group and did not reach a consensus 
in two reports to congress the president has charged the radar 
stations violated restrictions imposed by the treaty but that does 
not mean he will conclude the pact should be scrapped 
some of his advisers are known to be suggesting reagan try to 
persuade the soviets to level the krasnoyarsk facility in the 
interest of preserving the antiballistic missile treaty 
more hardline advisers reportedly are recommending he accuse 
the soviets of a material breach of the pact and abrogate it 
marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman declined on monday 
to discuss the options presented to reagan no decision has been 
made the spokesman said the issue is under review 
fitzwater said there are sound and valid arguments on both 
sides of the question and that reagan would make a decision 
before the review 
the treaty constrains defenses against ballistic missiles on the 
theory a potential aggressor might hold back if his country faced 
retaliatory devastation 
the soviets have denied reagans accusation that krasnoyarsk is 
a treaty infraction but many american analysts who question the 
presidents views on other arms control issues concur in his 
judgment about krasnoyarask 
in the meantime the treaty limits how fast and far the united 
states can go in its search for a spacebased defense against 
ballistic missiles that uses such sophisticated technology as laser 
beams and kinetic energy 
the program known formally as the strategic defense initiative 
is being carried out under what the reagan administration describes 
as a strict interpretation of the 1972 treaty a broader 
interpretation would provide more leeway and scrapping the treaty 
would remove all legal restraints

the maumee river is hardly flowing these 
days in this town whose name conjures images of waterfalls and 
flowing streams 
it is amazing said walter jones 53 who has lived near 
this village in northwest ohio most of his life i do not think i 
have ever seen the river this dry we have had some droughts but 
nothing like this 
the maumee has been the lifeblood for many communities along its 
banks but this summer levels in some stretches of the 
droughtstricken river have dropped so low that communities have 
implemented mandatory water use restrictions 
few villages have suffered as much as waterville the ohio 
department of natural resources says the maumee at waterville is 
flowing at 12 percent of its normal rate water use has been 
restricted since memorial day 
two weeks ago waterville officials asked grand rapids about 10 
miles to the south to open an old canal to release more water into 
the maumee 
the state rejected the plan saying the situation was not that 
critical 
however donald holycross watervilles village administrator 
said monday that the flow of water on the maumee has increased 
though not enough over the last week 
i still cannot tell you why he said i do not know 
whether it was because of rainfall along the river 
the 80milelong maumee originates in fort wayne ind snakes 
through several northwest ohio counties and empties into maumee bay 
on lake erie 
toledo ohios fourthlargest city and on the banks of the 
maumee hasnt suffered from the water shortage since it draws all 
its water from lake erie 
the drought has affected other streams in rural northwest ohio 
the 120milelong sandusky river another lake erie tributary 
has more than its share of dry spots and thousands of fish have 
been killed near the ballville dam fremonts main reservoir said 
rod lash the citys safetyservice director 
in fremont about 30 miles southeast of toledo officials have 
reached an agreement with the ohio division of water to release 10 
million gallons daily for five days from a reservoir near marion 
after that the state will provide 5 million gallons a day from the 
reservoir for as long as needed 
lash said it will take a week to 10 days for the water to make 
the 100mile trip north to fremont 
in fostoria which draws its water from the 50milelong portage 
river voluntary water restrictions are in place but that could 
change said j charles macias the citys safetyservice director 
the citys reservoirs he said have enough water to last for 
several months but is afraid the reserves could be depleted 
quickly if the drought continues 
macias said scattered showers that fell over the region on 
sunday and monday did little to alleviate the problem 
we only got about fourtenths of an inch not enough to pick 
up any water at all we would need two weeks of that kind of rain 
to have the normal water flow in the river he said

to a huge grocery distribution center sending flames into the sky 
early today that could be seen for miles 
firefighters contained the blaze which began monday night but 
said it could burn for hours and consume about a third of the 
safeway stores building which covers about 500000 square feet 
we are just trying to stop it before it destroys everything 
said police sgt roy howard spokesman for the joint firepolice 
department fighting the flames at the eightbuilding complex 
the blaze and massive clouds of smoke could be seen across san 
francisco bay in downtown san francisco about 15 miles to the 
southwest 
the big problems here are the size the magnitude howard 
said of the fire punctuated by occasional explosions in the 
onemillionsquarefoot complex 
no injuries were reported among the 600 workers who were at 
their jobs when the blaze erupted about 10 pm in the wooden

it moved just way too fast to do anything about it said 
employee chris karajanis 19 who was a few feet from where the 
fire started in paper products stacked on pallets 
he said a worker with a forklift tried to move the burning items 
to isolate them but the flames burned so quickly the man gave up 
first a number of us tried to put the fire out but when we 
saw there was no hope we evacuated the warehouse said dennis

naval action in the persian gulf is helping 
build sentiment in the pentagon to appoint an admiral to head the 
us central command headquarters for american forces in the 
region military sources said tuesday 
the joint chiefs of staff were divided over who should head the 
command and the chairman adm william j crowe jr sent the 
names of an admiral and an army general to defense secretary frank 
c carlucci 
the navy nominee to head the central command is vice adm henry 
c mustin the deputy chief of naval operations for plans policy 
and operations sources said they identified the army nominee as 
gen h norman schwarzkopf deputy chief of staff for operations 
and plans 
carlucci is expected to make a decision well before the current 
commander marine gen george b crist steps aside this november 
said the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity crist has 
headed central command since 1985 
since the command was created in 1983 assuming most of the 
functions of the rapid deployment force the top spot has been 
rotated between the army and the marine corps but because the navy 
has dominated the action in the persian gulf many in the pentagon 
believe the job should go to an admiral 
the command has its headquarters at macdill air force base in 
tampa fla although it maintains virtually constant radio contact 
with the overall commander of naval forces in the gulf rear adm 
anthony less aboard his flagship the uss coronado 
sentiment to name an admiral to head the command arose before 
the downing of an iran air jetliner with 290 people aboard on july 
3 said the sources 
central command is a unified joint command in which all air 
force navy army and marine corps forces in a jurisdiction are 
under the command of an officer chosen from one of the services

us ambassador richard melton met 
today with embassy personnel after the sandinista government 
accused him and seven other american officials of inciting unrest 
and ordered the diplomats to leave the country 
president reagan said today that in response to the expulsion 
orders he had ordered nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnerman and 
seven other sandinista representatives to leave the united states 
i have told the state department to send their ambassador and 
seven comrades back to managua reagan told reporters in 
washington 
us officials said melton was preparing to leave the country on 
a special flight later in the day after meeting with embassy 
personnel it was not clear if the seven other american diplomats 
would travel with him 
an embassy source speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
ambassador was meeting with embassy personnel 
in brussels belgium nicaraguas vice president today said no 
additional diplomatic action was planned against the united states 
to protest what he called us efforts to destablize the country 
we dont plan now to go beyond these measures sergio 
ramirez told reporters after meeting with officials of the european 
economic community 
earlier today the state department called the expulsion of the 
americans an outrage and completely without justification in 
manila secretary of state george p shultz also described 
nicaraguas expulsion order an absolute outrage and said 
washington would retaliate 
also on monday the sandinistas shut down the countrys roman 
catholic radio station arrested an opposition politician and 
closed the lone opposition newspaper la prensa for 15 days 
the moves came a day after police used tear gas and beat 
protesters in breaking up one of the largest antigovernment 
demonstrations since the sandinistas came to power an estimated 
10000 people took part 
foreign minister miguel descoto said the us diplomats who 
were ordered to leave within 72 hours had engaged in activities 
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of us 
president ronald reagan is carrying out against nicaragua 
he said he summoned melton to his office monday to inform him of 
the order 
descoto called melton a robot of the maniacal assistant 
secretary of state for interamerican affairs elliott abrams at 
a news conference 
he said us embassy officials were at sundays rally in 
nandaime about 40 miles south of managua at the interior 
ministery said police arrested 42 people the sandinistas have 
repeatedly accused us diplomats of trying to destablize their 
government by encouraging unrest

ordered expelled with melton as john e hope first secretary in 
charge of economic and commercial affairs hugh v simon jr first 
secretary delvin junker and david nolan both second secretaries 
john s creamer and aubrey a carlson third secretaries and vice 
consuls and robert bruce murray an assistant attache 
melton 52 arrived as ambassador in may filling the post left 
vacant since july 1987 
this man has violated all acceptable standards of behavior 
descoto said i told him that here you cannot come give orders 
like a proconsul in honduras and that this country is sovereign and 
independent 
on june 6 1983 the government expelled three us diplomats 
accused of taking part in an alleged plot to poison descoto the 
united states responded by closing several nicaraguan consulates in 
the united states 
in closing radio catolica the interior ministry accused the 
station of inciting to violence disorder and lack of respect for 
constitutional government in reporting about sundays 
demonstration 
in compliance with a regional peace plan both the station and 
la prensa were allowed to reopen in october after being shut down 
for more than a year 
an official in the interior ministry press office speaking on 
condition of anonymity said police on monday arrested miriam 
arguello secretarygeneral of the opposition conservative party 
for being the principal instigator of sundays rally 
witnesses said police started sundays fracas by pushing at the 
back of the crowd they said the crowd threw stones in response to 
police tear gas ten police officers were injured the official 
voice of nicaragua said it did not say how many protesters were 
hurt 
the sandinistas came to power in 1979 after a civil war toppled 
the rightist government of anastasio somoza 
the usbacked rebels known as contras have been fighting the 
government for nearly seven years they signed a preliminary peace 
accord march 23 and a tenuous ceasefire remains in effect 
in february congress turned down reagans request for renewed 
military aid to the contras

just weeks ago they were troublemakers 
working their way through the criminal justice system convicted of 
crimes from drug dealing to manslaughter 
today they stand at attention heads shaved eyes straight 
ahead every phrase ends with an emphatic sir every item in 
their foot lockers perfectly folded every order perfectly obeyed 
no they havent joined the military not exactly 
theyre probationers at camp sauble michigans 5monthold 
experimental boot camp prison where shock incarceration is 
used to jolt 17 to 25yearold offenders into straightening out 
their lives 
on monday reporters got their first glimpse of the intense 
physical training and militarystyle discipline the probationers 
endure for 90 days 
from the first day the offender is told hes an embarrassment 
to society a parasite to society said inspector bruce l 
curtis an exmarine drill instructor 
we start working on their minds curtis said its the 
first time theyve ever been held accountable for anything instead 
of holding down a job or going to school its been easier for them 
to knock some old lady on the street and take her social security 
check 
at first 19yearold jesse roberson of pontiac didnt think he 
could make it through the program 
when i first came here i was pretty scared said roberson 
who was driving drunk when a passenger in his car was killed in a 
crash he faced 15 to 30 years in prison for manslaughter 
robersons now looking at graduation in two weeks 
you come in a baby and you leave a man he said this 
program got rid of my temper and makes me want to go out and do 
something positive with my life 
scott fetzlaff 20 of manistee said hes had time to think 
about his mistakes including his breaking and entering conviction 
they scare everything right out of you the first day he 
said its going to change my ways when i get out 
the program which began march 1 at a former minimumsecurity 
work camp in the manistee national forest has had seven graduates 
and now has 70 probationers about half its capacity two men 
escaped only to be captured within 24 hours and 16 others have 
flunked out returning to the judge for resentencing usually 
resulting in a multiyear prison term 
those who disobey orders may be required to carry a 25pound 
motivational log on their shoulder for the day or to perform 
motivational detail possibly digging out a tree stump by hand 
for the probationers days begin at 5 am with the screams of a 
corrections officer or the banging of trash can lids at their 
heads physical training cleaning buildings and 7 hours of 
chopping trees in county state and federal parks make up most of 
the 17hour days followed by educational and substance abuse 
programs at night 
one hour of free time may be spent watching television news or 
writing letters no visits are allowed and one 10minute telephone 
call may be made each week after the first six weeks 
the men march double time chanting in unison after the officer 
in charge mental tough mental hard i can do it you can do it 
we can do it 
a shifting eye while standing at attention may result in 15 
pushups on the spot there is silence at meal time 
the program is modeled after similar programs in other parts of 
the country but is designed for more hardcore offenders than 
the others said donald hengesh state department of corrections 
project coordinator 
while offenders must not have served any previous prison 
sentence their convictions range from felonious assault and 
manslaughter to forgery and narcotics possession 
there are no sunday school cases here said hengesh 
the department of corrections has notified judges and probation 
officers that the program is an option for offenders who according 
to sentencing guidelines would face at least one year of prison 
the only exception would be a probation violator with a new felony 
conviction who might be sentenced to a prison term of less than 12 
months 
candidates must never have served any prison time and must be 
physically able to participate offenders convicted of sex or arson 
charges also are not admitted 
the program is proving cost effective with each inmate costing 
3846 compared with 20000 each state prison inmate costs 
annually hengesh said 
while civil rights activists argue intimidation and fear dont 
rehabilitate state sen jack welborn who sponsored legislation to 
fund the camp said hes sold on the program 
i believe a kid in this program has a better chance of going 
straight when he gets out than in any other program in the 
corrections system he said the kid that goes into prison 
comes out a better criminal

ragtime a 29inch high miniature horse can live in a womans 
house and back yard but neighbors and the city threaten a civil 
suit 
the panel of two ventura county superior court judges upheld 
municipal court judge herber curtis september 1987 decision that 
patty fairchild could keep ragtime on her property thousand oaks

curtis ruled that a city law prohibiting the keeping of two 
horses on less than 20000 square feet of property did not clearly 
apply to one horse 
it brought tears to my eyes mrs fairchild said monday 
after she learned of the decision by melinda johnson and bruce 
thompson the ruling was endorsed by superior court judge kenneth 
yegan 
the city has since revised its ordinance but mrs fairchild 
will not be recited said assistant city attorney shawn mason he 
said officials will rely on a suit by the city or one brought by 
the oakbrook homeowners association to obtain a favorable court 
ruling the homeowners group claims the horse creates an offensive 
stench and violates city rules 
ragtime a 2yearold american miniature horse spends most of 
his time outdoors at the 6000squarefoot fairchild home but 
occasionally goes inside to eat or sit on the family couch

defense secretary frank carlucci said tuesday 
he has warned defense contractors that their weapons programs may 
yet be suspended if they are tainted by the developing pentagon 
bribery investigation 
carlucci testifying to the senate armed services committee 
noted he had lifted a july 1 suspension of contracts for nine 
military programs because a review had found none were adversely 
affected by the case 
but in doing so we have sent out a warning that says this 
does not mean if there is further information that comes to light 
that we will not once against review this contract and take 
appropriate action he said 
the investigation involves allegations that defense contractors 
and consultants bribed pentagon officials for details that could 
have been vital in bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars 
no charges have yet been filed 
carlucci told the senate panel he is writing to the chief 
executives of the top 200 defense contractors urging them to 
ensure stringent management controls on the use of consultants and 
to avoid improper business practices 
my job is not to punish companies my job is to protect the 
national security said carlucci noting that it is up to the 
justice department to prosecute alleged crimes 
but he outlined a number of actions the pentagon can take 
including rescinding terminating or suspending contracts or 
fining individuals 
carlucci admitted that there are problems in the procurement 
process there are defects in how america equips its forces he 
said 
the current investigation is a good reason to correct those 
flaws he said even if the probe reveals no more than the 
misdeeds of a few greedy lawbreakers i still want to move forward 
now in cooperation with congress to remedy flaws in our system 
regardless of whether those flaws are related to the justice 
investigation 
carlucci noted that he has appointed a task force to propose 
changes and he appealed to congress not to usurp that panels role 
hasty or piecemeal reforms could do more harm than good 
he said 
he also urged that the administration be given credit for past 
changes 
our nation has in this decade markedly improved its defense 
acquisition system the justice department probe should in no way 
tarnish the progress the defense department and congress have 
made 
some of the wrongdoing being uncovered may simply be 
violations of the law not system deficiencies he said some 
system flaws highlighted by the probe may be ones that our 
government has not really tackled such as budget instability and 
political intervention points 
some uncovered flaws perhaps were unavoidable 
consequences of past reforms for example one of the most complex 
issues we face is the impact of increased competition for 
contracts highstakes competition may cause difficult problems 
that are just now surfacing carlucci said 
he also said one major problem in the process is what i would 
term intervention points opportunities for friendships or 
political clout to carry more weight than contractor performance or 
product quality and cost 
we can reduce these opportunities for intervention through 
such techniques as longterm contracts simplifying specifications 
freezing weapons designs contracting to performance and multiyear 
approvals of programs he said 
carlucci opposed suggestions that an allcivilian force should 
be created to buy weapons 
a remedy for procurement difficulties is not to exclude from 
the process the military professionals who will use the defense 
systems we buy he said our military people have a vital 
interest in the quality of those systems and in how efficiently we 
buy them we must retain user involvement in defense acquisition 
that means the military services must continue to play a major 
role

orange flames lit the night sky of soviet central 
asia tuesday as the soviet union launched the second of a pair of 
space probes on an 111 millionmile odyssey to explore the 
mysteries of mars and help prepare for a manned flight to the red 
planet 
soviet television showed a recording of the 901 pm moscow 
time 101 pm edt launch of phobos ii during its evening news 
broadcast last weeks launch of the phobos i was televised live 
but at the time of tuesday launch staterun television was showing 
coverage of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs visit to poland 
a sovietmade proton booster rocket roared to life and carried 
the solarpanel powered probe off the launchpad at the baikonur 
cosmodrome on the steppes of central asia 
its companion phobos i was launched skyward atop a 
200foothigh proton booster rocket from baikonur on thursday and 
soviet media said its onboard navigation systems were switched on 
the next day 
more than a dozen nations including the united states are 
participating in the international mission to swoop close to the 
surface of mars moon phobos and drop instruments onto the 
satellite that scientists say may provide clues to how the universe 
was formed 
nasas deep space network will provide radio tracking data so 
the probes can locate the moon which is only about 17 miles 
across if phobos is an asteroid trapped by mars gravity as many 
scientists believe the probes will be able to study matter that is 
little changed since the infancy of the solar system billions of 
years ago 
if all goes well the two soviet spacecraft will enter the 
gravitational pull of mars in january and fall into orbit just 
behind phobos for a threemonth remote study of the martian 
surface atmosphere and magnetic field next to venus mars is the 
heavenly body believed to most resemble the earth 
in april the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop 
to within 100 feet of phobos surface where they will release two 
100pound landers 
the soviet news agency tass said that in one experiment a laser 
beam carried by a lander will used to split off a tiny piece of 
phobos rocky surface and trap it for close examination 
one of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a 
stationary position sending back data to arth another is 
scheduled to bound like a kangaroo about the little moon in 65foot 
leaps gathering and analyzing soil samples 
soviet scientists say the phobos mission is an important step 
toward a manned flight to mars which they hope will be possible 
early in the 21st century 
soviet officials have put the cost of the phobos mission at 480 
million

michael dukakis choice of texas sen lloyd 
bentsen to be his running mate drew praise from fellow democrats 
today with several of them likening it to another 
massachusettstexas ticket john f kennedy and lyndon b johnson 
in 1960 
the massachusettstexas combination got this country moving 
again in 1960 and it will do the same for the nation in 1988 
said sen edward kennedy dmass younger brother of the late 
president 
dukakis and bentsen both were quick to draw the comparison 
between this campaign and the one 28 years ago 
the massachusetts and the texas exes were good for the 
country and good for the democratic party in 1960 and its going to 
be a real winner in november of 88 bentsen said today 
selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential 
act if i can use that word that i will do dukakis said in 
introducing his running mate lloyd bentsen brings to this ticket 
and will bring to this nation years of experience 
bentsens selection gives the democratic party a strong ticket 
for november and even more important the strong prospect of 
eight solid years of effective new leadership for america 
kennedy said 
texas state treasurer ann richards who will be the keynote 
speaker at next weeks democratic convention in atlanta called 
bentsen a level guy who will make a great vice president 
and added 
theres always been a sort of austintoboston mass 
connection and i think that this ticket adds that same sort of 
magic 
ms richards also said that bentsen would boost democrats 
chances in texas one of the states that dukakis likely republican 
opponent george bush calls home 
sen paul simon dill whose own hopes for the presidential 
nomination were dashed earlier this year agreed that bentsen could 
help the democratic ticket in texas and said he thought the texas 
senator might help the democrats carry oklahoma and louisiana as 
well 
lloyd bentsen is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker simon 
said this is an excellent choice and this is a winning ticket 
democratic prospects in texas oklahoma and louisiana will be 
boosted immediately and when the american people get to know lloyd 
bentsen it will strengthen the ticket everywhere simon added 
arkansas gov bill clinton who will deliver the nominating 
speech for dukakis said he also believed that bentsen would help 
the democrats carry texas and would help the party across the 
region 
i like and respect him very much clinton said 
sen barbara mikulski dmd said she believes lloyd bentsen 
will be a fine addition to the democratic ticket he knows his 
issues and he knows his politics best of all she said he 
knows how to beat george bush he did just that in 1970 to become 
us senator 
in florida where democrats had been pushing home state sen bob 
graham for the no 2 spot on the dukakis ticket state rep mike 
abrams also offered praise for bentsen and said a dukakisbentsen 
victory in his state is doable 
we all know its going to be tough said abrams who is 
coordinator of the dukakis campaign in florida but he added the 
choice of bentsen shows a sensitivity to the south and brings 
defense and foreign policy and washington experience all 
considered crucial to a democratic victory in florida 
even backers of jesse jackson who came in second to dukakis in 
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of 
those the massachusetts governor had considered for the second 
spot seemed satisfied with bentsen 
florida state rep james burke who was the state campaign 
coordinator for jackson said we would have preferred to have 
had jesse he added though that bentsen is a better choice 
than some of the others he could have picked 
john white a former democratic national chairman who has been 
advising jackson said he was excited about the choice of 
bentsen and said it would make texas a hell of a battlefield 
union activists also praised bentsen saying that the texas 
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with 
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and 
layoff notices some of labors top legislative priorities this 
year 
bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two 
plant closing notices and the trade bill were compatible said 
robert mcglotten legislative director for the aflcio and he 
let his colleagues know how he felt 
geraldine ferraro who four years ago was picked as democrat 
walter mondales running mate said she was delighted at the 
choice of bentsen 
i think its an indication that governor dukakis intends to 
run a strong national campaign ms ferraro said 
on the republican side senate minority leader bob dole of 
kansas frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on bushs 
ticket said he thought dukakis couldnt have picked a better 
man 
rep lynn martin rill who is national cochairwoman of 
bushs presidential campaign called bentsen a nice man whos 
able but said she still anticipated that bush would be able to 
carry texas 
on the similarity to the kennedyjohnson ticket of 1960 she 
said im sure were going to hear 1960 ad nauseum theres a 
slight difference of course he bentsen was not selected by his 
peers to be in leadership as lyndon johnson the senate majority 
leader had been nor is dukakis john kennedy

associated press writer 
boston ap democrat michael dukakis today named texas sen 
lloyd bentsen as his vice presidential running mate for the fall 
campaign we go to atlanta and begin the road to victory 
dukakis said 
dukakis likened himself to john f kennedy who won the white 
house for the democrats in 1960 with texan lyndon johnson on the 
ticket 
and like 1960 when republicans nominated an incumbent vice 
president and were defeated dukakis said jack kennedy and 
lyndon johnson beat that incumbent republican vice president in 
1960 and michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen are going to beat them 
in 1988 
he said bentsen brought to the democratic ticket years of 
experience and a deep commitment to civil rights that goes way 
back to the 1940s dukakis said bentsen stood for good jobs at 
good wages a central theme of his campaign 
bentsen who received a standing ovation from the crowd spoke 
with force and emotion rarely seen from dukakis himself 
the fact that hes chosen a senator from texas a senator from 
the south shows that were going to fight for every state in the 
union and were going all out to win bentsen said 
bentsen said dukakis a son of greek immigrants was living 
out his parents dream but wants that dream a reality for all 
americans 
dukakis lavishly praised bentsen for his work in congress 
he has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of the 
senate finance committee he has personally and successfully led the 
fight for welfare reform for catastrophic health insurance he 
said 
dukakis praised his work on a trade bill and a plant closing law 
that will give workers at least 60 days notice before theyre 
thrown out in the street 
if edwin meese can give himself 30 days notice then the least 
we can do is give honest hardworking workers 60 days notice before 
we lay them off he said 
the political marriage was announced in a sweltering faneuil 
hall in boston with political luminaries in the audience and a 
large crowd of supporters standing outside 
dukakis and benstsen were joined by their wives kitty dukakis 
and beryl ann bentsen the hall was festooned with signs 
proclaiming dukakisbentsen 88 campaign staffers threw 
baseball caps reading dont mess with texas to the cheering 
crowd 
dukakis was introduced by another bostonian democratic party 
chairman paul kirk who also recalled kennedys selection of 
johnson as running mate in 1960 we see history repeating itseelf 
today and well see it repeated in november in 1988 he said 
with his choice dukakis signaled a determination to challenge 
the republican partys electoral college stronghold in the south 
and especially in bushs presumed strongest state texas is his 
adopted home state 
texas has 29 electoral votes more than any state except 
california and new york and some dukakis aides have said they hope 
selecting a southerner would at least force the expected republican 
candidate to spend more time defending the region than he would 
want 
in 1970 bentsen defeated george bush in a run for the senate 
from texas bush now the republican presidential 
nomineeinwaiting said recently bentsen doesnt worry me 
adding we can carry the state even if bentsen is on the 
democratic ticket 
bentsen 67 is little known outside of texas in a national 
gallup poll in midmay 77 percent of the people surveyed said they 
did not know enough about bentsen to say what they thought of him 
of the few who had an opinion 3 percent said they had a very 
favorable view of bentsen 12 percent mostly favorable 6 percent 
mostly unfavorable and 2 percent very unfavorable 
bentsen an elegantly tailored silverhaired patrician is the 
scion of a wealthy landed family from the rio grande valley and a 
cardcarrying member of the senate democratic establishment he is 
a former chairman of the democratic senatorial committee a 
position that requires fundraising to elect democrats to the 
senate and has been chairman of the senate finance committee since 
democrats gained control of the senate 18 months ago 
on at least one key issue bentsen has parted company with 
dukakis voting for aid to the contra rebels fighting the 
nicaraguan government dukakis frequently has denounce the reagan 
administration support for the contras a failed and illegal 
policy 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee campaigned 
with dukakis in texas last friday and downplayed talk he would be 
chosen for the vice presidential nomination telling reporters i 
dont think you have to worry about that 
at the time dukakis said of bentsen he could make a great 
contribution to this country in many many ways he already has 
bentsen as well gave no hint either in words or body language 
that he felt close to the selection 
bentsen is up for reelection to his senate seat in november 
and if he chooses could run for both offices at once a precedent 
set by johnson in 1960 
bentsen will be nominated at the democratic convention in 
atlanta on july 21 the fourth and final night of the party 
gathering convention delegates must ratify dukakis choice 
bentsen was chosen over six others who were being considered by 
dukakis jesse jackson sens john glenn of ohio albert gore jr 
of tennessee and bob graham of florida and reps richard gephardt 
of missouri and lee hamilton of indiana 
bentsens selection closes weeks of speculation on who dukakis 
would choose to round out his ticket jackson had raised the stakes 
on monday by saying he would accept if asked jacksons reaction to 
the selection of bentsen could be crucial to convention harmony and 
democratic hopes of a victory in november 
while the massachusetts governor has an unquestioned majority in 
the convention hall jacksons response to being passed over may 
provide the first signal of how hard he will work for the ticket in 
the fall campaign 
in washington jackson was asked if dukakis had informed him of 
a decision no he said 
bentsen a millionaire businessman has been a central player in 
congress battle with president reagan over trade legislation an 
issue democrats plan to play heavily in this falls campaign his 
committee also oversees tax legislation and the welfare reform bill 
currently before a housesenate conference committee 
bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the democratic presidential 
nomination but excited little interest in 1984 he was on 
democratic nominee walter mondales list of possible running mates 
the only white male interviewed by mondale in a field that 
included former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein and eventual 
pick geraldine ferraro 
on the negative side bentsen created a brief furor in february 
1987 when it was revealed that he had asked lobbyists to pay 
10000 apiece to join him for breakfast once a month 
the breakfast club called the chairmans council held one 
meeting and was quickly disbanded with bentsen promising to return 
the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists

michael dukakis today chose sen lloyd bentsen as his democratic 
running mate duplicating a massachusettstexas ticket that won the 
white house for john kennedy in 1960 were going to fight for 
every state in the union and were going all out to win bentsen 
told a boisterous boston campaign rally 
in their joint appearance at historic fanueil hall the 
massachusetts governor cited the parallels to 1960 as well as 
bentsens strengths 
lloyd bentsen brings to this ticket and to this nation years 
of experience a deep committment to civil rights and equality of 
opportunity that goes way back to the 1940s dukakis said 
the republicans in 1988 are about to do what they in 1960 
when they nominated an incumbent vice president the democratic 
presidential nomineeinwaiting said jack kennedy and lyndon 
johnson beat that incumbent vice president president in 1960 and 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen are going to beat them in 1988 
early this morning dukakis began to call the other democrats 
who had made it onto his short list of possible running mates to 
tell them of the decision but jesse jackson who flew from 
cincinnati to washington early today apparently did not get a call 
before the choice became known 
a curt no was jacksons reponse to a reporters question in 
washington on whether he had talked with dukakis jackson would 
only say no comment on the choice of bentsen as he headed for 
private meetings with supporters 
he and bentsen passed through the same washington airport 
terminal within minutes of each other today without meeting as 
bentsen headed to boston with top dukakis aide paul brountas 
in boston dukakis praised bentsen for his work in congress 
saying he has hit a grand slam homerun because as chairman of 
the senate finance committee he has personally and successfully 
led the fight for welfare reform for catastrophic health 
insurance as well as work on a trade bill and a plantclosing 
legislation 
bentsen 67 said his choice is a clear signal for the fall 
campaign 
the fact that hes taken a senator from texas a senator from 
the south shows that were going to fight for every state in the 
union and were going all out to win bentsen said 
even as democrats braced for reaction from party liberal 
activists and jesse jackson supporters some republicans were hard 
put to criticize the choice senate gop leader bob dole frequently 
mentioned as a possible vice president on george bushs ticket 
said dukakis couldnt have picked a better man 
former democratic national committee chairman john white a 
jackson supporter from texas said bentsen has one of the best 
civil rights records in the senate he voted against the poll tax 
when he was in the congress back in the 50s hes not a 
newcomer 
dukakis choice sets up a homestate showdown with the 
republicans for the big prize of 29 electoral votes since vice 
president bush the gops presidential nomineetobe claims texas 
as his voting residence 
it makes texas a battleground said republican strategist 
vince breglio 
the massachusettstexas combination got this country moving 
again in 1960 and it will do the same for the nation in 1988 
said sen edward m kennedy whose brother tapped lyndon johnson in 
1960 a reluctant decision that was instrumental in kennedy 
winning a close election 
bush said in an interview published today that the selection of 
bentsen wont change his claim to texas 
bentsen doesnt worry me bush told the boston globe before 
bentsens selection we can carry the state 
bush has lost to bentsen once already they squared off in a 
1970 race which propelled bentsen to the senate for the first of 
his three terms 
dukakis chose bentsen at a late monday night meeting with top 
aides brountas and susan estrich just hours after jesse jackson 
for the first time declared his hopes for the vice presidential 
nomination 
the next 24 hours will provide a highly visible stage for 
jackson to give his response to the bentsen choice and for dukakis 
to appeal to jacksons supporters for the unity he needs for a 
peaceful convention in atlanta next week 
jackson speaks to the annual convention of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people tonight 
following a bush speech there earlier on wednesday dukakis and 
bentsen will appear at the naacp meeting 
bush promised the naacp that he would fight for civil rights as 
president whether or not he receives strong black support in the 
fall and he praised jackson 
and i dont have to cover up the differences i have profound 
differences with jesse on many of these issues but i salute him 
for running the race for being heard and he deserves a salute 
from us bush said again drawing loud applause from the audience 
and the reaction of other liberal democrats to the selection of 
the conservative texan was certain to spark interest in atlanta 
wild absolutely wild said one liberal party official of 
the choice i have no idea what his civil rights record is 
some jackson supporters have talked of entering his name in 
nomination for vice president as a challenge to dukakis although 
jackson has not spoken publicly on the subject 
bentsen is little known outside of his home state polls 
suggest a gallup poll in midmay said 77 percent of respondents 
had not heard enough about bentsen to offer an opinion on the texas 
senator 
dukakis chose bentsen off a short list of seven possible running 
mates including jackson sens john glenn of ohio albert gore jr 
of tennessee and bob graham of florida and reps richard gephardt 
of missouri and lee hamilton of indiana 
dukakis sent brountas his campaign chairman to washington on 
monday to meet with jackson it was when brountas returned to 
boston to meet with the massachusetts governor that the decision 
was made 
if it was offered to me i would accept it jackson said 
after meeting with brountas he said it was selfevident that 
he wants the no 2 spot on the ticket 
he continued to stir his careful mixture of promise and problems 
for dukakis saying we intend to have an effective informative 
convention that would inspire our nation unify our party and take 
us to victory 
democrats looking for a peaceful convention saw new signs of 
hope monday as party chief paul kirk proclaimed the battles over 
the party platform might be resolved without a messy fight on the 
floor 
i dont expect that there will be any socalled floor fights 
on the platform kirk told reporters in atlanta there may be 
differences of opinion there may be agreements to disagree all 
the indications that i have are whatever differences had existed 
they are gradually being worked out 
bush was already sharpening his rhetoric in preparation for a 
fall campaign that continues to look like a tight battle 
i am not the one who feels that the problems of agricultural 
america can be solved by planting more belgian endive bush told 
a farm meeting in washington 
the vice president was referring to the massachusetts governors 
suggestion in early 1987 in iowa that crop diversification was a 
solution to agricultural problems pointing to farmers experience 
in his home state 
a tight race was the analysis from the latest cbs newsnew york 
times poll 
it put dukakis ahead of bush by a 4739 margin among 947 
registered voters surveyed by telephone last week the margin of 
error was plus or minus three percentage points

two us helicopters traded fire with a 
pair of iranian gunboats after the boats attacked a tanker in the 
northern persian gulf today us military sources said 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said there was 
no damage to the aircraft and it was not known whether the boats 
were damaged in the clash which took place at about 7 pm 
the sources said the helicopters off the us missile frigate 
nicholas were responding to a distress call from a panamanianflag 
tanker west of irans farsi island 
the helicopters took fire from the two small boats and 
returned fire with rockets said a us official there was no 
damage to the helos helicopters we have no damage assessment on 
the boats 
shipping executives said the attack on the tanker started a fire 
in the engine room of the 81282ton universal monarch but that 
the crew put out the blaze on their own and that no one aboard the 
vessel was injured 
it was the second time in less than two weeks that an american 
warship responded to a distress signal from a neutral ship in the 
gulf the previous time was on july 2 in the southern gulf when 
another frigate intervened to drive off iranian speedboats 
attacking a danish tanker 
the next day the uss vincennes shot down an iranian passenger 
jet following an exchange of fire with iranian boats iran said 290 
people aboard the plane died the united states said the plane was 
shot down in the mistaken belief it was an attacking warplane the 
reagan administration has promised to make reparations to the 
families of the victims 
the londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit said the 
universal monarch is owned by a hong kong company and managed by 
the japanese company tokudo shasen kk of tokyo 
the vessel was sailing empty to pick up cargo from the khafji 
fields owned jointly by kuwait and saudi arabia the executives 
said 
farsi island is a stronghold for revolutionary guards who often 
carry out attacks in the gulf 
in the socalled tanker war an offshoot of the 8yearold 
iraniraq war iran attacks neutral shipping in the gulf in 
retaliation for iraqi raids on its oil tankers 
last thursday iraqi warplanes raided two supertankers in the 
vicinity of irans kharg island oil terminal at the northeastern 
end of the gulf the greekowned 264108ton fellowship l and the 
cypriot 215780ton star ray were set afire but no casualties were 
reported 
the iranian ship attacks have continued despite a broadened role 
for us navy warships in the gulf enabling them to protect 
commercial vessels even if they do not fly the stars and stripes 
iran has attacked two commercial vessels the norwegianowned 
tanker berge strand and the romanianowned freighter plataresti 
since the uss vincennes shot down the iranian passenger jet

richard thornburgh is preparing to become the 
next attorney general at a time when justice department and white 
house officials are trying to launch a major antidrug initiative 
in congress 
acting associate attorney general frank keating said this week 
the reagan administration is anxious to get legislation revamping 
portions of immigration law to make it easier to deport aliens 
convicted of drug trafficking and to bar the entry of drug 
traffickers into the united states 
keating said that this is one of about 30 measures the 
administration wants congress to enact including one authorizing 
the death penalty for persons convicted of murder while engaged in 
a continuing drug enterprise 
however congressional democrats have yet to appoint anyone to 
president reagans joint executivelegislative branch drug task 
force which was supposed to shape the legislation and 
congressional sources have said the democrats dont plan to 
participate 
the legislative agenda is stalled keating told a news 
conference we think this is an issue which transcends party 
lines antidrug legislation of some kind appears inevitable in 
this election year 
drug trafficking as well as two other top justice department 
priorities organized crime and pornography have been at the top 
of thornburghs own agenda his attacks on the three while us 
attorney for western pennsylvania in the early 1970s led to his 
appointment in 1975 by president ford as assistant attorney general 
in charge of the departments criminal division 
attorney general edwin meese iii may still be in office to 
handle two other major items on the departments agenda meese said 
tuesday that his own plans havent totally jelled yet but 
that he still plans to leave toward the end of july or early 
august as he said last week when he announced he was resigning 
meese reiterated through department spokesman patrick korten 
that he hopes to decide whether the detroit free press and the 
detroit news should be allowed to merge their advertising 
circulation and production operations under the newspaper 
preservation act 
meese also may still be in office when the department decides 
whether to seek an indictment of former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos who has been investigated by a number of federal 
grand juries since he was ousted in february 1986 marcos lives in 
exile in honolulu 
however meese probably will be gone by the time federal 
prosecutors are ready to seek indictments in the pentagon 
investigation which is being coordinated by the us attorneys 
office in alexandria va the indictment are not expected until 
late in the year 
also on the justice department agenda senate confirmation 
hearings late this month for keating deputy attorney general 
harold christensen and criminal division chief edward dennis all 
are currently serving in acting capacities 
christensen and dennis are replacing former deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and assistant attorney general william weld 
the criminal division head whose protest resignations march 29 
over meeses continued tenure brought accusations of a serious 
leadership gap in the department 
the department under thornburgh also will be coping with the 
issue of drug testing the program would subject 1800 justice 
employees in sensitive jobs to mandatory random urinalysis the 
employees many of them lawyers are suing the department saying 
the program that could begin shortly violates their constitutional 
right to due process and to protection against unreasonable 
searches and seizures

gov buddy roemer who vanquished 
threeterm gov edwin edwards with a reform campaign finished his 
first regular legislative session with many more victories than 
failures lawmakers say 
during an 85day session that ended late monday the legislature 
approved a balanced budget a teacher pay raise a campaign finance 
reform measure and a framework to revive the states stagnant 
economy 
when we started 120 days ago this state was wounded this 
state was hurt this state was down roemer told a joint 
housesenate meeting before adjournment this is a good state and 
we pulled together to try to bring it back right again 
i think overall the governor has been successful with the 
programs he has been pushing hes won far more than he has lost 
said sen william jefferson 
when he took office march 15 after defeating edwards last fall 
roemer inherited an accumulated deficit of 1 billion that 
threatened to bankrupt a state saddled with a corrupt image he 
often described as that of a banana republic 
edwards spent much of his third term successfully defending 
himself against federal racketeering charges 
by the close of the lawmaking session roemer could point to 
passage of his plan for overhauling public schools and an 8 
billion state budget based on conservative oil price projections in 
this energyproducing state 
on the final day of the session lawmakers also granted the 
governor continuance of the authority to make emergency budget cuts 
it granted him during a special legislative session shortly after 
he took office 
however roemer must first obtain the blessing of a legislative 
panel 
i wish reductions to the budget would have been greater 
said rep allen bradley im not trying to be critical because we 
did make substantial reductions but not as much as i think we 
could have 
the legislature also approved restrictions on personal 
contributions to political candidates and contributions from 
political action committees candidates also will be required to 
report all donations and expenditures 
during his campaign roemer said he took no pac money and no 
contribution larger than 5000 
despite the progress louisianas fiscal problems are not 
solved said sen don kelly an administration floor leader 
these problems have not been cured they wont be cured until 
we have true fiscal reform said kelly

an analysis of computer tapes from the 
cruiser vincennes has been delivered to experts trying to 
reconstruct the shooting down of an iranian jetliner us 
officials said tuesday 
the tapes were flown to the united states last week for analysis 
at a navy laboratory in virgnia the analysis has now been flown to 
the persian gulf accompanied by two specialists who will present 
the analysis to the sixmember team of investigators 
as the secrecyshrouded inquiry entered its second week the 
focus was on resolving conflicts over the altitude and other 
details of iran airs flight 655 just before the a300 airbus was 
blown apart over the strait of hormuz on july 3 killing all 290 
people aboard 
us military officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the computer analysis could prove crucial in determining 
whether a misreading of target data by the vincennes sophisticated 
aegis air defense system led the ships commander capt will c 
rogers iii to fire at what he believed was an iranian f14 fighter 
the pentagon said the airbus was emitting a confusing mixture of 
identification signals one typical of a commercial airliner and 
another similar to that which us ships had received previously 
from iranian f14s 
while the vincennes initially reported the jetliner at about 
9200 feet and descending to about 7900 feet before it was hit 
data from two other us warships indicates it was nearer to 12000 
feet and either flying level or climbing us officials in 
washington were quoted as saying 
one of the ships the frigate elmer montgomery was close by at 
the time the plane was shot down and the other the missile frigate 
john h sides was about 17 miles away 
both ships monitored the military radio messages in which us 
officials said rogers tried repeatedly to make contact with the 
jetliner and tracked it on radar but they did not record the 
sequence of events on computer tape said a navy official who 
asked not to be named 
neither of those ships has anything even close to aegis so 
what they could provide is pretty limited by comparison said the 
official 
the montgomery a 3800ton frigate designed for antisubmarine 
warfare was with the vincennes during a clash with iranian 
gunboats that occurred less than an hour before the iran air plane 
was shot down 
investigators earlier interviewed officers of all three ships 
under oath the vincennes remains anchored off bahrain but the 
montgomery and the john h sides returned to duty several days ago 
the investigators according to a navy official are trying to 
collect anything that has some bearing on the disaster 
he said this includes information that only iran could provide 
such as whether a military plane might have played a role in the 
confusion or warned the airbus a senior us officer said last 
week that any direct access to iranian officals or data appeared 
highly doubtful 
us officials said earlier that an iranian scout plane a 
usbuilt p3 orion apparently was airborne and could have 
monitored and relayed the vincennes warning messages to the 
jetliner 
iranian pilots and others have been quoted as saying the pilot 
of flight 655 would have been so busy talking with controllers in 
bandar abbas tehran and dubai his destination across the gulf 
that he would not necessarily have heard the cruisers radioed 
warnings on the civilian radio frequency 
iranian officials have not acknowledged that the plane was 
transmitting a military identification signal on mode 2 the 
frequency reserved for military use as the americans claim 
a us source said the iff or identification friend or foe 
codes used by iranian f14s had been given to the vincennes by the 
missile cruiser wainwright which the vincennes replaced on gulf 
duty in late may 
the airbus flight recorder also could provide important clues 
to the planes altitude and other details but irans navy 
commander rear adm mohammed hossein malekzadegan said on monday 
there was no truth to reports that it had been recovered

president reagan assured kuwaits prime 
minister tuesday that he will continue to push for a proposed sale 
of maverick missiles to the persian gulf state 
posing for photographers as he met with crown prince and prime 
minister sheik saad alabudllah alsabah reagan said you bet 
were going to fight for it we want very much to complete that 
asked if there was any chance of success he replied i think 
so 
last week the senate voted to strip the mavericks from a 18 
billion arms package that included 40 f18 fighterbombers for the 
tiny oilrich gulf country critics contended the missiles could be 
turned against israel in the event of a middle east war 
but a senior us official briefing reporters in advance of 
sheik saads visit said israel still would retain a strategic edge 
over any combination of hostile arab countries even if the 
purchase were approved 
the senate voted against the mavericks in an appropriations 
amendment that is likely to be approved by congress that does not 
kill the sale however since arms purchases are considered final 
unless both the senate and house reject them down within 30 days 
after they are formally announced 
in his formal remarks at a departure ceremony for the first 
kuwaiti leader to visit here in 20 years reagan said we 
strongly support the request for f18 aircraft and accompanying 
weapons now pending before congress 
skeik saad in his response thanked reagan for us support 
he said kuwait was grateful for americas willingness to escort 
its oil tankers in the wartorn persian gulf and said we 
appreciate the effective role of the united states as a superpower 
in resolving issues of world peace 
a us official describing the talks tuesday on condition of 
anonymity quoted reagan as telling sheik saad we will keep 
pitching for f18s the official said both the united states and 
kuwait consider the maverick missiles part of an integrated 
package and want it to stay that way 
kuwait concluded a weapons deal with the soviet union over the 
weekend and us officials have expressed concern about american 
allies turning to other countries to obtain armaments saudi arabia 
agreed to buy sophisticated weaponry from britain after a us 
sales package ran into congressional opposition 
the administration officials said the kuwaitis clearly have 
the means to purchase weapons through other channels if they wish

sen lloyd bentsen is more a plus than he is 
a minus on womens issues but his stance on contra aid and 
defense spending could alienate women voters in november womens 
groups said tuesday 
the texas senator democrat michael dukakis running mate 
choice offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to 
republican george bush especially if bush picks a female running 
mate said molly yard president of the national organization for 
women 
if youre a democrat its very worrisome she said 
polls have shown that bush is troubled by a gender gap that 
has many women leaning toward the democratic candidate in the 
presidential race but the choice of bentsen doesnt solidify the 
womens vote in the democratic column the groups said 
now and the bipartisan national womens political caucus rated 
bentsens record as generally good based on his support during the 
100th congress of civil rights legislation medicaid funding for 
abortion in the district of columbia and his opposition to the 
supreme court nomination of robert bork bentsen has also supported 
the equal rights amendment 
basically hes more a plus than he is a minus said ms 
yard i think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he 
is very much a hawk he was procontra aid and for all the money 
spent on defense he is really business as usual and thats why the 
voters want change 
women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to 
contra aid she said because they want this world to turn into a 
world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting 
irene natividad chairman of the national womens political 
caucus said womens groups had not expected this year that 
democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because the 
sense was that the democratic party felt they had already done a 
women on the ticket 
geraldine ferraro who was walter mondales running mate on the 
losing democratic ticket in 1984 said she was delighted by the 
choice of bentsen 
she said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen since 
there were not enough women in national political office to provide 
dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate 
if we had a woman in that senate seat or in the statehouse 
that had the credentials that senator bentsen has i of course 
would be disappointed but because we dont have a woman in that 
spot i am not she said in a telephone interview from new york 
ms ferraro said bentsen has been fine on issues that i and 
many women care about and in addition to that hes going to be a 
very strong help to the ticket rounding it out beautifully so that 
with a democrat in the white house its going to make a difference 
for the women in this country 
rep pat schroeder dcolo who explored the possibility of 
running for president in 1988 said that problems with the economy 
are more likely to make women vote democratic and that bentsen as 
head of the senate finance committee offered strong credentials on 
that issue 
all the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly 
understanding whats wrong with the economy because theyre the 
ones out there trying to juggle two jobs theyre going to be very 
pleased with bentsen she said 
the real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet 
the family budget every month somehow i dont think theyre going 
to see bush as identifying with that problem she said

agriculture and weather service officials said tuesday this 
weeks rain eased the drought in illinois but not in ohio while 
kentucky officials pleaded for more waterhauling trucks to help 
people whose wells have run dry 
in massachusetts a state environmental official said the bay 
state was not in the same condition as the droughtstricken midwest 
but noted a drop in julys rainfall and urged conservation 
in johnson city tenn the public library canceled its annual 
worm race because the critters have burrowed deeper into the soil 
in search of moisture 
showers and thunderstorms dampened parts of the midwest and 
southwest from arkansas into southern and eastern missouri and 
across southern illinois and southern indiana a flash flood watch 
was posted for parts of north central texas after heavy overnight 
rain 
farmers in southern illinois reported 24hour rainfall ranging 
from 02 to nearly 4 inches but agriculture officials said more 
was needed to offset dry conditions 
everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 
hours said du quoin farmer herman krone whose 2800acre farm 
president reagan plans to visit thursday during a tour of the 
droughtravaged area 
however krone noted almost onethird of his 1200 acres of 
corn already have been lost 
in ohio the national weather service said scattered showers in 
the last week have had virtually no impact conditions in 
southwestern ohio were rated extreme the worst category listed 
under the index used to measure drought severity in the 
northeastern part of the state conditions are rated severe the 
nexthighest category the service said 
at least 50 truckloads of hay gathered from the carolinas and 
virginia are being shipped to ohio on thursday in a drive organized 
by the charlotte motor speedway and the national association for 
stock car auto racing 
the kentucky division of disaster and emergency services issued 
a plea tuesday for more waterhauling trucks to help people whose 
wells have dried up the heaviest concentration of homes in need of 
water are in extreme northern kentucky just south of cincinnati 
according to agency spokesman don armstrong 
rain monday and tuesday was the first significant rainfall 
kentucky has had since early june but was far from a salvation 
according to krit stubblefield a spokesman for the state 
department of agriculture 
the showers came too late to save corn but could buy more time 
for soybeans and tobacco he said 
in massachusetts state environmental affairs secretary james s 
hoyte noted that the states largest reservoir system was 13 feet 
below its usual level and called for increased water conservation 
we are taking out of the reservoir far more than nature can 
replenish said hoyte noting that rainfall for july is only 
onequarter of the average rainfall for the month 
in northeastern georgia the state department of natural 
resources ordered the city of toccoa to impose an immediate ban on 
outdoor watering city officials had asked for an exemption from 
statemandated water restrictions because they believed a new 3 
million project to draw water from lake yonah had made the city 
virtually droughtproof 
the gwinnett county commission agreed to pay a 75000 state 
fine for exceeding its june allocation of water from lake lanier 
but refused to enact tougher outdoor watering restrictions for 
county residents gwinnett northeast of atlanta is one of the

former pennsylvania gov richard l 
thornburgh picked by president reagan to head the troubled justice 
department pledged tuesday to follow the evidence wherever it 
may lead in the matter of outgoing attorney general edwin meese 
iii 
thornburgh declined to answer questions about meese in any 
detail however in an appearance in the white house briefing room 
with reagan who announced the nomination and urged swift 
confirmation by the senate the administration will be in office 
for only six more months 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thornburghs 
nomination will be sent to the senate during the week of july 25 
when congress will be back from a weeklong recess that begins 
friday so that members can attend the democratic national 
convention 
sen strom thurmond of south carolina the senior republican on 
the senate judiciary committee said that he hoped hearings would 
begin right away and added that they can if the democrats 
dont delay the matter 
sen edward m kennedy of massachusetts the no 2 democrat on 
the committee which will review thornburghs nomination said he 
expected a rapid confirmation 
i have the greatest respect for dick thornburgh kennedy 
said the state of justice in america would be very different 
today if dick thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3 
years instead of ed meese 
although no date has been set for a confirmation hearing a 
staff source at the senate judiciary committee speaking on 
condition of anonymity said its reasonable to assume a 
hearing will be held in early august with a full senate vote by 
aug 12 congress begins a threeweek recess after aug 12 
meese himself was enthusiastic about reagans choice of 
thornburgh i think its excellent i had the opportunity to talk 
in some detail with the president about the various candidates and 
i think dick thornburgh is actually at the top of the list meese 
said 
hes an outstanding person and im sure hell do an excellent 
job meese added 
thornburgh 55 had been mentioned as a possible running mate 
for vice president george bush the likely republican presidential 
nominee and since thornburghs name surfaced on monday as reagans 
probable choice for the attorney generals job there was talk that 
the former pennsylvania governor would be kept in the justice post 
during a bush administration 
fitzwater said vice president george bush was consulted about 
the nomination 
on the question of whether thornburgh would remain as attorney 
general if bush were elected president bush spokesman stephen hart 
said i think its premature to even speculate about that 
george bush himself said only that thornburgh will be an 
outstanding attorney general just as he was an outstanding 
governor i strongly support his nomination 
thornburgh was asked if he expected to remain after january in 
the event of a bush victory i obviously cant speak for the vice 
president he replied but i think that law enforcement is a 
24houraday sevendayaweek proposition and whether youre on 
the job for six days or six months or six years it is a fulltime 
effort 
meese whose affairs have been under investigation by 
independent counsel james mckay announced last week that he would 
resign by early august both meese and reagan have said that they 
believe mckays 830page report which has been filed in court but 
not made public vindicated the attorney general 
among the matters mckay probed were meeses assistance to 
wedtech a bronx ny defense contractor under investigation for 
payoffs to win government contracts meeses actions in connection 
with a proposed 1 billion iraqi oil pipeline project and whether 
he took actions favorable to regional bell telephone companies at a 
time he held 14000 in telephone stock 
when asked whether he planned to look into the meese matter 
thornburgh said i really cant answer any substantive questions 
at this time 
my intention and this is in any area is to follow the 
evidence wherever it may lead he said and not knowing what 
that evidence is i cant give you a prediction 
meese could still face an internal department review of his 
actions portions of mckays sealed report are said to question 
meeses candor and ethics 
fitzwater said reagan had given thornburgh no advice on the 
issue 
those matters are all left to the incoming attorney general 
the spokesman said 
reagan called thornburgh the ideal choice for attorney 
general saying that in six years as us attorney for western 
pennsylvania he was a prosecutors prosecutor a toughminded 
crime buster 
i urge the senate to move quickly to confirm him as well as 
our other justice department nominees so they can roll up their 
sleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land the 
president said 
also awaiting senate confirmation are the deputy attorney 
general harold christensen the no 3 person in the department 
associate attorney general francis keating and the criminal 
division chief edward dennis 
christensen and dennis have been on the job since early june 
keating has been at work about a month longer all were appointed 
on an acting basis by reagan 
christensen and dennis are replacing former deputy attorney 
general arnold burns and assistant attorney general william weld 
whose protest resignations march 29 over meeses continued tenure 
brought accusations of a serious leadership gap in the department 
as a us attorney thornburghs attacks on organized cime 
public corruption and drug trafficking led to his 1975 appointment 
by president ford as assistant attorney general in charge of the 
justice departments criminal division 
thornburgh gained national recognition in 1979 when after only 
72 days as governor he was faced with the nations worst 
commercial nuclear accident at three mile island near the state 
capital of harrisburg 
six years later he said he learned several lessons from the 
accident they included forget partisanship during crises dont 
be afraid to scramble the organization chart and respect but 
do not depend on the news media 
thornburgh was bared by law from seeking a third term as 
governor h left pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the 
institute of politics at harvard universitys kennedy school of 
government

the nations cities encumbered by burgeoning 
budget gaps spawned by federal aid cutbacks sharply increased 
local fees this fiscal year and many also raised property taxes a 
study reported tuesday 
over half the countrys major cities face potential deficits 
although some will be able to dip into reserves to avoid finishing 
the year in the red said the study by the national league of 
cities 
the present trends are dangerous and potentially 
devastating said alan beals executive director of the league a 
national organization of local governments beals called the 
nations domestic policies on cities indifferent at best and 
destructive at worst 
the league report titled city fiscal conditions in 1988 
describes how 347 communities from large cities such as los 
angeles to smaller towns like yankton sd are coping with the 
end two years ago of the federal revenue sharing program 
the survey found that 67 percent increased existing fees and 
charges for city services in the 1988 fiscal year while 44 percent 
reduced spending this year on capital construction projects 
fiftyfive percent cut back the growth of their operating budgets 
and 41 percent raised property taxes 
those figures were higher than 1987 when 58 percent raised fees 
and 38 percent raised property taxes over the year before 
in addition 37 percent of the cities said they had instituted 
new fees another 14 percent reduced city services 
cities overwhelmingly cited federal cutbacks as the reason for 
their budgetary straits almost half of the cities that cut 
services said less federal money was the main reason and 64 
percent of those who scaled back capital projects cited the loss of 
revenue sharing 
the backbone of america our cities and towns is bending 
under an increasing load beals said at a news conference 
whether this burden will continue to grow more cumbersome or 
whether it will be relieved through a more responsible set of 
national policies is one of the urgent questions of the 1988 
elections and for the next administration beals said at a news 
conference on the report 
the news conference was held as word came that michael dukakis 
the likely democratic presidential nominee had picked sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas as his running mate bentsen heads the senate 
finance committee and has worked with the league on a number of 
issues affecting the nations cities beals noted 
we found him to be very openminded and responsive and he 
has given us a very sympathetic hearing beals said 
the report measured spending estimates for the 1988 fiscal year 
the 12month period that ended june 30 which the report 
acknowledged are not yet final 
it said 50 percent of the cities expect expenditures to exceed 
revenues in 1988 but noted that cities usually are pessimistic in 
such projections the actual percentage of cities that finish their 
fiscal years with deficits is expected to be lower since 
municipalities facing shortfalls dip into reserves carried over 
from previous years to balance their budgets the report said in 
1987 33 percent of the cities surveyed by the league actually 
reported shortfalls down from 40 percent in 1986 
more than half those cities had surpluses in 1986 and 1987 but 
only 24 percent said they expect to take in more than they spend in 
the 1988 fiscal year 
the survey also found that 25 percent of the cities had actually 
seen revenues from all sources decline in 1988 from last year 
in other areas of spending the survey found that 25 percent of 
the cities had reduced the number of city workers 24 percent had 
raised or imposed new fees for developers and 22 percent had frozen 
municipal hiring eighteen percent had instituted new taxes or 
raised sales taxes

ambassador richard melton who was ordered by 
the nicaraguan government to leave the country is believed to be 
the fifth us diplomat of his rank to be withdrawn at the request 
of the host government over the past 15 years 
earlier this year the us ambassador to saudi arabia hume 
horan was recalled by the united states because of personality 
differences with king fahd 
unlike melton however horan was not declared persona non grata 
but saudi authorities made clear the monarchs displeasure with 
horan who spent only seven months in saudi arabia 
within days after horans recall president reagan nominated 
ambassador walter cutler to replace him 
the case involving melton is believed to be the first of its 
kind since 1976 when the us ambassador to equatorial guinea 
herbert spiro was ordered out of the country us relations with 
equatorial guinea were poor at the time because of unpredictable 
behavior of president masie nguema and other factors 
during that period spiro was the accredited ambassador to both 
cameroon and equatorial guinea but resided in cameroon he made 
occasional visits to equatorial guinea full relations with that 
country were not restored until 1979 
in 1975 the us ambassador to zaire dean hinton was expelled 
by president mobutu sese seko for alleged interference in zaires 
internal affairs 
in 1973 jamaican prime minister michael manley expelled 
ambassador vincent deroulet after the envoy had said the united 
states refrained from interfering in the 1972 national elections in 
jamaica in return for a promise from manley not to nationalize 
certain us business investments in jamaica manley denied the 
allegation

jesse jackson today called the selection of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as michael dukakis running mate a 
strategic move and said im too controlled to be angry at 
being passed over 
jackson said he will support the ticket nominated at the 
democratic national convention next week but brushed off questions 
about whether he will campaign enthusiastically for the party 
the approach he used today was of course a matter of his own 
campaign making a strategic move to solidify his organization that 
is his right to do jackson said at a news conference 
jackson said he first learned of the selection from reporters 
who met him at an airport here this morning he said dukakis later 
phoned him but they did not have a lengthy discussion 
asked if he was angry jackson replied no im too 
controlled im too clear im too mature to be angry im focused 
on what we must do to keep hope alive 
jackson nearly crossed paths at the airport with bentsen who 
was preparing to leave for boston the two did not meet 
jackson declined comment on most of the questions he was asked 
by reporters as he walked to his car at washingtons national 
airport when asked if dukakis had informed him of a decision he 
said no 
the night before jackson stated publicly for the first time 
that he would accept the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket and 
said he assured dukakis talent scout that he would be a loyal vice 
president 
but jackson stopped short monday night of pledging loyalty if he 
is not chosen for the ticket 
jackson told reporters that would depend on discussions yet to 
be held between him and the massachusetts governor the certain 
nominee when democrats convene in atlanta next week 
jackson and dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas met with 
reporters after a twohour private session here monday as brountas 
neared the end of the running mate search for dukakis 
jackson who has said repeatedly he had earned serious 
consideration for the no 2 spot previously had demurred at saying 
whether he would accept a bid he joked to a farm group before the 
job interview so far dukakis has not accepted my offer and i 
have not refused his 
but there were no jokes after the session with brountas 
jacksons second interview for the job 
if it was offered to me i would accept it he said if 
its not offered to me then how i respond will be based upon many 
things that weve not yet discussed 
jackson who technically remains in contention for the 
democratic nomination even though dukakis has a numerical lock on a 
firstballot victory at the convention said we intend to have 
an effective informative convention that would inspire our nation 
unify our party and take us to victory he said they did not 
discuss outstanding differences on the party platform 
he said he gave brountas my candid views as to the office of 
the vice presidency and shared with him when asked what i thought 
my qualifications to be and my vision of that role 
brountas called it an excellent meeting very productive 
it served the purpose for which it was intended and that is to 
continue and to conclude the background check phase of the 
selection process 
brountas who flew back to boston monday night said i plan 
to review my meeting with reverend jackson with the governor and 
then its up to the governor 
jackson adviser john white who took part in the meeting told 
reporters that although brountas did not say when dukakis would 
announce his decision i got the impression it was going to be 
very soon in the next couple of days 
jackson asked to rate his chances said there is no way of 
judging that 
asked if the interview could have been a charade jackson said 
i have no basis to challenge the intergrity of mr brountas or 
gov dukakis if this is just a charade it is a great waste of 
their time at a time when time is precious 
asked if he would consider having his name placed in nomination 
for vice president if dukakis chooses someone else jackson said 
thats not under consideration 
jackson asked if brountas had asked him to promise loyalty to 
dukakis said he did ask it the answer is yes because thats 
the right thing to do but jackson made clear he was only talking 
about loyalty as a running mate 
he said they talked about not only the requirements of the vice 
presidency but the latitude no one of course would be asked 
to do anything illegal or unconstitutional 
so long as there is room for serious discussion debate and 
deliberation maturity requires that you agree to agree and that 
you agree to disagree said jackson on your best day 
your point of view may prevail at your worst your point of view 
simply may be a matter of influence 
im one to support the party ive done that down through the 
years 
earlier jackson said if i am not on the team then the 
governor must determine who the team members are and what role they 
will play he said he was seeking a partnership of equity and 
shared responsibility 
asked how his followers would respond if he is left off the 
ticket jackson said lets take it one day at a time my 
constituency is tough and matured enduring loyal but also 
responsible as it seeks its rightful place in our partys 
leadership it has earned partnership in our party

sen lloyd bentsen selected by michael 
dukakis on tuesday as his democratic running mate will also 
continue his bid for a fourth term in the senate a dual campaign 
made legal in texas in 1959 to let lyndon b johnson run two races 
it worked for johnson after losing the 1960 democratic 
presidential nomination to john f kennedy johnson was elected 
vice president and won his senate race 
but johnsons wins cost democrats the senate seat republican 
john tower later won a special election for the post which is 
still held by the gop 
if bentsen wins both races this year his senate seat would 
become vacant in january texas gov bill clements a republican 
would then appoint a replacement to serve until a special election 
clements also would set the special election day under state 
law that election could be on may 7 aug 13 or nov 12 secretary 
of state jack rains said clements also could set an emergency 
election on any date he chooses but that move would have to be 
cleared by the justice department 
rains said it usually takes 70 days to get justice department 
approval for emergency elections 
he also said the law is silent on any deadline for calling 
the special election clements could wait as long as he pleased to 
set it according to rains 
bentsens november senate opponent is us rep beau boulter of 
amarillo who has said it would not be fair for bentsen to make 
both races but david weeks spokesman for the bentsen senate 
campaign said that is just what bentsen will do 
he is going to run a vigorous campaign for the senate weeks 
said 
if he beats boulter and also wins the vice presidency bentsens 
senate seat would be vacant sometime in january he could choose to 
take the senate oath on jan 3 and then resign his senate seat when 
he takes the vice presidential oath on jan 20 bentsen could also 
opt to skip the senate oath in which case the senate seat would be 
open jan 3 
the special senate election would be open to all candidates the 
1960 race drew 70 contenders tower won a runoff over bill blakley 
who had been appointed interim senator by thendemocratic gov john 
connally 
texas democrats are confident they could hold the senate seat if 
bentsen becomes vice president especially if the dukakisbentsen 
ticket carries texas in november 
texas other us senator is phil gramm a republican who won 
the seat in 1984 after tower retired

the state department flatly rejected on 
tuesday a proposal by soviet general secretary mikhail s gorbachev 
for a meeting of european leaders to achieve movement on reducing 
conventional arms 
spokeswoman phyllis oakley called it an attempt to divert 
attention from the business at hand she also criticized less 
harshly an offer to scale down air forces in eastern europe if 
nato agreed to forgo the redeployment of 72 us jet fighter planes 
in italy 
mrs oakley said reducing forces in europe was a subject for 
consideration by the 16member nato alliance and not for the united 
states and the soviet union to decide on their own 
gorbachev made the two proposals monday in a speech to the 
polish parliament in warsaw the swift us response reflected an 
unwillingness to explore new approaches with moscow in preference 
to ongoing multinational negotiations in vienna and proposed 
bloctobloc talks 
we see little utility in proposing a new different form 
mrs oakley said 
the vienna negotiations have not produced troop reductions new 
negotiations are supposed to be held between the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the warsaw pact in the austrian capital 
but a date has not been set 
the key problem appears to be a us demand that the soviet 
union simultaneously considers improving its human rights record 
mrs oakley reading from a prepared statement said vast 
conventional superiority of the warsaw pact over nato was the 
cause of security problems in europe 
the first step toward rectifying this imbalance is to reach 
eastwest agreement on a negotiating mandate for new arms control 
talks covering nato and warsaw pact conventional forces from the 
atlantic to the ural mountains she said 
mr gorbachevs proposal is an attempt to divert attention 
from the business at hand in vienna if the soviet union is sincere 
in its pursuit of conventional reductions it will work in vienna to 
achieve a muitally acceptable mandate and a balanced outcome 
at the same time the state department spokeswoman criticized 
gorbachevs suggestion that the warsaw pact would consider 
withdrawing analogus air force units from eeastern europe if 
nato aggreed to drop plans to move 72 us f16 warplanes to italy 
from spain where they were ordered to leave over three years 
a matter of common alliance concern will not be undertaken on 
a bilateral basis mrs oakley said we are prepared to give 
serious consideration to any proposal that will enhance the common 
goal of enhancing stability in europe 
she drew attention to a statement by manfred woerner of west 
germany the new secretary general of nat0 rejecting the proposal 
he said the nato alliance was concerned mostly with reducing land 
forces on their own aircraft do not capture and hold 
territory

former white house aide michael k deaver was 
ordered tuesday to appear sept 23 to be sentenced for lying to a 
grand jury and a house subcommittee about his lobbying business 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson also scheduled a 
sept 15 hearing to take testimony about deavers problems with 
alcohol which the defense contended impaired the former 
presidential aides memory he gave sworn testimony two years ago 
testimony about deavers alcoholism would be offered by the 
defense in an attempt to show there were mitigating circumstances 
that would warrant a short sentence or probation 
the hearing promises to be the first full airing of the 
alcoholism issue which was never raised during the trial because 
deavers lawyers rested their case without calling any witnesses 
a recovering alcoholic deaver was convicted dec 16 1987 on 
three counts of lying to a grand jury and a house subcommitee about 
the lobbying business he formed in 1985 after resigning as 
president reagans deputy chief of staff 
deaver who was questioned by the panels about allegations that 
his lobbying of former government colleagues violated federal 
conflictofinterest laws could be sentenced up to five years in 
prison for each of the perjury convictions 
the sentencing was stayed on feb 2 after a federal appeals 
court struck down the independent counsel law under which deaver 
was prosecuted 
the supreme courts 71 decision last month upholding the 
constitutionality of courtappointed independent counsels set the 
stage for deaver to be sentenced 
during a brief hearing on the case stephen braga one of 
deavers lawyers told jackson that the defense wanted to present 
testimony from the head of an alcoholism rehabilitation clinic in 
havre de grace md where deaver spent 30 days in 1985 
braga said deavers doctor at georgetown university hospital 
would also be called to testify about the former presidential 
aides treatment for the disease earlier that year 
the defense has contended in court papers that deavers memory 
was impaired by his bout with alcoholism and therefore he wasnt 
lying when he testified that he couldnt recall making certain 
lobbying contacts 
during the trial deavers lawyers rested their case without 
presenting witnesses including doctors who treated him for 
alcoholism 
several former employees of michael k deaver amp associates who 
appeared as prosecution witnesses testified during 
crossexamination that deaver suffered memory lapses and moodiness 
which they later attributed to alcoholism 
but the judge instructed jurors to disregard this testimony 
saying it was speculative and selfserving 
independent counsel whitney north seymour jr told the judge he 
might call a medical expert to rebut testimony given by deavers 
witnesses 
deavers hospitalization for alcoholism in june 1985 is a 
period cited by the defense as a time when his memory was impaired 
by alcoholic withdrawal and sedation 
several telephone calls deaver made to government officials 
including one to thentransportation secretary elizabeth dole took 
place while the former white house aide was in the hospital 
deaver was found guilty of lying to the grand jury when he 
testified i dont recall any government contact i made on 
behalf of trans world airlines

although he may lose the election opposition 
candidate cuauhtemoc cardenas appears to have secured a position as 
the rallying point for the discontent with the party that has ruled 
mexico for 59 years 
whether he won the presidential election or not is still a 
matter of heated debate he says he did the governing 
institutional revolutionary party or pri says he didnt 
privately top pri officials admit cardenas won the federal 
district the core of the sprawling mexico city metropolitan area 
and three of mexicos 31 states 
even those victories would be a stunning blow to the pri which 
has won every presidential race since its founding in 1929 with at 
least 70 percent of the vote and never has lost a senate or 
gubernatorial race 
cardenas claimed monday he won 39 percent of the vote nationwide 
to pri candidate carlos salinas de gortaris 35 percent 
after a weeks delay and opposition charges of fraud the 
government has only provided partial returns on the race for the 
lower house of congress 
figures released tuesday by the pri say salinas had 5359 
percent of the votes counted cardenas was second with 2608 
percent and manuel j clouthier of the conservative national 
action party followed with 1604 percent 
even these figures which the opposition disputes would be an 
astonishing feat for cardenas a candidate who in december started 
to build his predominantly leftist coalition from a tiny base 
his campaign was considered unlikely to shake the foundations of 
power and ruling politicians dismissed him as a candidate of 
nostalgia who was trading on his famous name 
through it all the charismatic candidate never lost his 
composure 
before hundreds of thousands of adoring supporters on the 
campaign trail in the steamy battle over vote fraud at 
middleofthenight news conferences in the dayslong wait for the 
returns he was always calm always reasonable 
while clouthier barreled down the campaign trail blustering 
about civil disobedience cardenas quietly counseled restraint and 
spoke of using the force of law 
cardenas 54 spent the day before the election in the central 
state of michoacan where he once was the governing pris governor 
he wasnt basking in the warmth accorded a favorite son he was 
mourning his old friend and political strategist francisco xavier 
ovando gunned down while on the way home from a political strategy 
session 
xavier has fallen because he was fighting for mexico to have a 
true and authentic democracy cardenas said he died because he 
dreamed of a better an independent and a free mexico 
that moment was like a snapshot capturing the campaign and the 
candidate 
cardenas was criticized for wanting to turn the clock back to 
1910 when the mexican revolution started with the promise of a 
better life or to 1938 when his father mexicos revered 20th 
century president nationalized mexicos oil and handed the young 
republic its pride 
but the cardenas message wasnt about the nuts and bolts of 
governing it was visceral he became a focal point of discontent 
with a system that seemed calcified by nearly 60 years of 
singleparty rule 
it was an ironic role for politician who once seemed to be the 
ultimate product of a system his father the late president lazaro 
cardenas helped create 
cardenas flourished in the pri he was its governor in michoacan 
and also a senator the break started last year when cardenas 
seemed to sense the growing force of a cold wind of disfavor that 
was about to blast the pri 
calling his movement the democratic current he told the party 
to hold a presidential primary the traditionalists in the party 
refused and cardenas defected forming a leftofcenter coalition 
the national democratic front 
when he decided to run for president he campaigned virtually 
without a critical forum television tv in mexico is 
governmentcontrolled or progovernment 
but as he traveled the nation he gathered larger and larger 
crowds winning the support of peasants students the struggling 
middle class intellectuals and oil workers 
about a month before the election he did what was considered 
impossible he unified the left the candidate of the mexican 
socialist party the largest organized leftist force dropped out 
and endorsed cardenas 
no one knows if that political unity will survive once the 
campaign passions cool but cardenas now appears to command a 
popular force the governing party cannot ignore

the last time a massachusetts democrat invited 
a texan to be his running mate he didnt think the offer would be 
accepted and after lyndon johnson took him up on it a shocked 
john f kennedy asked his brother now what do we do 
that set kennedy and his brother robert his campaign manager 
and closest confidant in that 1960 election to agonizing over how 
to uninvite the proud powerful and feared senate majority leader 
in the end kennedy of massachusetts ran with johnson of texas 
and narrowly won the 1960 election like every democrat who won the 
presidency since texas became a state he had the votes from the 
lone star state 
twentyeight years later in a lengthy and more deliberative 
process michael dukakis of massachusetts the putative 
presidential nominee of the democratic party once again has turned 
to a texan sen lloyd bentsen to be his vice president 
jack kennedy and lyndon johnson beat that incumbent vice 
president in 1960 and mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are going to 
beat them in 1988 dukakis said as he made known his choice of a 
running mate 
echoed bentsen the massachusetts and the texas axis was good 
for the country and good for the democratic party in 1960 and its 
going to be a real winner in november of 1988 
just as it did in 1960 texas rich harvest of electoral votes 
and the advantage of having a southerner on the ticket played a 
part in dukakis decision 
john f kennedy according to many accounts gave no thought at 
all during his campaign for the nomination as to who would run with 
him but after the delegates in the los angeles convention chose 
him kennedy had only a few hours to make his pick he told his 
brother how terrible it was that he only had 24 hours to select a 
vice president 
on returning to the rented apartment where he was staying 
kennedy found the warmest and most cordial telegram of 
congratulations from johnson according to theodore white in his 
classic the making of the president 1960 
until that moment kennedy had accepted at face value johnsons 
statement that he would never never never trade his senatorial 
vote for the vice presidential gavel white wrote 
robert kennedy said his brother told him he would offer the 
nomination to johnson first thing the next morning john kennedy 
went to see the senator 
i was in his room when he came back robert said in a 1965 
interview with historian arthur schlesinger and he said you 
just wont believe it 
i said what 
and he said he wants it 
and i said oh my god 
he said now what do we do 
we spent the rest of the day and we both promised each other 
that wed never tell what happened alternating between thinking 
it was good and thinking that it wasnt good that hed offered him 
the vice presidency and how he could get out of it robert 
kennedy said 
one of the major factors ultimately that persuaded him that he 
should take him was the fact that he would be so mean as majority 
leader that it was much better having him as vice president where 
you could control him than to have him as majority leader 
particularly after you had offered him the job then it would have 
been disastrous to have that affront and withdraw it 
the two kennedys decided to try and have johnson take himself 
out robert said he made two trips to johnsons hotel room on the 
first he said johnsons close friend house speaker sam rayburn 
was there and kennedy only tried to feel johnson out but like 
everything else about that time there are different versions of 
that meeting 
phil graham the late publisher of the washington post who was 
close to johnson recalled these events in a famous memorandum that 
dukakis recently studied during his search for a vice president 
lbj seemed about to jump out of his skin graham wrote of 
the first lyndonbobby meeting he shouted at me that bobby 
kennedy had just come in and told rayburn and him that there was 
such opposition and that lyndon should withdraw for the sake of the 
party 
on the second visit robert kennedy said he and johnson were 
alone it was 230 pm on the last day of the convention 
robert said he conveyed two thoughts hed worked out with his 
brother that there would be an unpleasant fight by labor leaders 
if johnson were on the ticket and that john kennedy wanted him to 
play an important role running the party and thereby build the 
machinery he could use to run for president in 1968 
i dont know whether it was just an act or anything kennedy 
told schlesinger but he just shook and tears came into his 
eyes and he said i want to be vice president and if the 
president will have me ill join with him in making a fight for 
it 
i said well thats fine he wants you to be vice president 
if you want to be vice president we want you to know 
at this point too there are conflicting accounts bobby 
remembered returning to his brother who said he had been advised 
that vaccilation on the vice president was disastrous and that he 
would announce johnson as the choice 
james rowe a new deal lawyer in johnsons camp recalled that at 
the end of the first meeting graham called john kennedy who told 
him bobbys not up to date ive already announced that johnson 
is the candidate

sixteen lawyers for people and companies in 
the defense procurement probe are demanding that the justice 
department launch an investigation into the sources of leaks to the 
press 
a department official said tuesday it is too early to decide 
whether to do so 
we are writing to you to request that you commence an 
investigation and take appropriate remedial action to deal with the 
virtual flood of leaks by department of justice employees involved 
in or privy to the details of the investigation the attorneys 
said in their unusual letter one lawyer called the joint effort 
extraordinary 
the letter dated july 8 and publicly released tuesday was 
addressed to michael e shaheen jr head of the justice 
departments office of professional responsibility it complained 
that frequency and substance of these leaks is 
unprecedented 
shaheen who has responsibility for investigating ethics cases 
involving justice employees refused to comment john russell a 
department spokesman said it was too early to determine that we 
will undertake an investigation 
several of the defense counsels are former assistant us 
attorneys obviously taking advantage of their knowledge of 
internal justice department procedures to stop what they feel is a 
case of government officials trying their case in the newspapers 
and on television 
justice investigators have knowingly ensured dissemination of 
confidential information and sensationalization of the entire 
investigation by leaking information the letter said 
such leaks create an environment in which our clients cannot 
be dispassionately investigated they said 
they suggested that shaheen focus on possible violation of seven 
statutes regulations or rules barring justice employees from 
revealing unauthorized material one law carries a fine of up to 
1000 and imprisonment of a year for divulging certain material 
other penalties can include a letter of censure or dismissal 
investigations into leaks are not unusual russell said at 
one time we have anywhere from 10 to 15 leak investigations going 
on he said some of those include improper revelations of 
classified material 
henry e hudson the us attorney in alexandria va who is 
coordinating the massive probe also has expressed concern about 
leaks in the case which was brought to public attention on june 
14 fbi agents conducted surprise searches on more than three dozen 
homes and offices in 12 states on that day 
no one has been charged in the investigation of the pentagons 
150 billionayear procurement business indictments are not 
expected until the end of the year though grand jury subpoenas 
have been issued for midjuly 
the allegations are that defense consultants often former 
military officers bribed pentagon officials to obtain secret 
information that gave their employers an edge in obtaining 
contracts 
some of the information in the case has come from search 
warrants used by the fbi in alexandria va and st louis mo as 
well as from one affidavit released in dallas texas the 
affidavit which contained information gathered by telephone 
wiretaps gave a detailed account of the investigators case 
hudson has argued that the affidavits should remain under seal 
because defense attorneys could take advantage of gaps in the 
governments knowledge if the papers are open to public inspection 
several news organizations around the country have filed lawsuits 
challenging the sealing orders 
the defense attorneys also complained that members of congress 
have quite predictably gone public with information provided by 
justice department officials 
among the lawyers signing the letter are e lawrence barcella 
jr and robert plotkin who represent defense consultant melvyn 
paisley and michael schatzow whose client is pentagon official 
james gaines paisley a former top navy official has been 
identified as a key player in the investigation gaines a 
longtime friend of paisleys since their days at the boeing co 
worked as a navy procurement official

aloha airlines inspectors confirmed tuesday they 
found evidence of corrosion in several of their boeing 737 
jetliners years before the april 28 accident in which the top of an 
aloha jet ripped off over hawaii 
in one case a 7inch crack was found on a sister ship in the 
same section of fuselage that ripped away in april leaving a large 
gaping hole above passengers heads 
henry arii alohas vice president for quality control and 
engineering said the crack was discovered during a routine 
inspection aloha officials blamed the crack on corrosion and said 
it was promptly repaired 
ariis comments came during the first of four days of hearings 
the national transportation safety board is holding on the safety 
and maintenance of aging jets 
ntsb officials said the inquiry was not to assess blame in the 
aloha incident but to collect more evidence about the accident in 
which 61 of 94 people aboard were hurt and one flight attendant was 
swept to her death before the damaged craft landed on maui 
although one of the two engines had quit the pilot and copilot 
struggled to control the crippled jet and managed to land it safely 
13 minutes later 
representatives of the boeing co the federal aviation 
administration and other industry groups also are scheduled to 
testify 
in documents released last month by the ntsb boeing officials 
warned aloha months before the accident to make a thorough 
structural inspection of the plane involved in the accident and of 
three other aging 737s 
besides the plane found to have the 7inch crack arii 
testified that aloha inspectors found some bulges and corrosion in 
the skin over fuselage joints on a third boeing 737 flown by the 
airline 
thomas haueter an ntsb aerospace engineer asked whether aloha 
inspectors considered these discoveries which came over the course 
of several years significant and a reason to adjust their 
inspection of the jets 
i cant recollect replied arii who did recall the airline 
using more corrosion inhibitors on the planes during routine 
maintenance checks 
the 7inch crack found in 1984 must have been viewed as an 
isolated incident by the airline arii said in response to a 
question by board of inquiry chairman john k lauber 
haueter shot back that the crack wasnt an isolated incident 
if you looked at the service reports 
analyses by ntsb engineers found some evidence of corrosion 
disbonding and bulging skin on the surface of the april 28 
accident plane where pieces of the fuselage were joined together 
that plane had made 89690 landings the second highest of any 
boeing 737 in service the only plane with more landings 90051 
also was being flown by aloha it was taken out of service after 
the accident

two american helicopters answering a call 
for help from a tanker exchanged fire with a pair of iranian 
speedboats tuesday in the northern persian gulf us military 
officials reported 
they said the helicopters were not damaged and it was not known 
whether rockets fired by the choppers hit the boats the sources 
who spoke on condition of anonymity said the shooting occurred at 
about 7 pm 
the helicopters were not identified by type but descriptions of 
the incident indicate they were two of the us armys specially 
equipped scout aircraft based on some us warships in the gulf 
navy officials refuse to discuss the helicopters or even confirm 
their presence in the gulf although the pentagon disclosed that 
information last year it was the second time in less than two 
weeks that us forces went to the aid of a nonus flag vessel 
under fire by iranians 
the frigate elmer montgomery aided a danish tanker in the 
southern gulf july 2 driving its attackers away no casualties 
were reported in that encounter which occurred the day before the 
us missile cruiser vincennes shot down an iranian jetliner over 
the strait of hormuz pentagon officials say the captain thought it 
was an iranian f14 fighter 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said in washington that in 
tuesdays attack the iranian boats had been shooting at the 
81282ton universal monarch which broadcast a distress alert 
saying it was being attacked and was on fire 
two helicopters from the missile frigate uss nicholas were 
sent out to investigate the ships mayday call howard said 
they were fired on by two small boats that we assume were 
iranian they fired rockets at those small boats 
the military helicopters returned fire with rockets but we do 
not yet have any word if there was any damage to the iranian 
boats he said the helicopters were not hit by the iranian 
fire 
the military officials in bahrain who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the nicholas was on a patrol in the northern gulf 
and the confrontation occurred about 15 miles west of farsi island 
irans revolutionary guards use as a speedboat base for attacks 
on neutral shipping in the 8yearold war with iraq 
shipping executives said the universal monarch which is hong 
kongowned and registered in panama was sailing empty to pick up 
cargo from the khafji fields owned jointly by saudi arabia and 
kuwait 
the gunboats attacked the tanker with rocket grenades and set it 
afire the american officials said the nicholas a 3600ton 
frigate that arrived in the gulf about three weeks ago was about 
six miles away 
crewmen put out a fire in the tankers engine room and there 
were no casualties said the shipping executives who spoke on 
condition their names not be used 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit in london said the vessel was 
flooding but the shipping executives said it was not serious a 
us official said the nicholas offered humanitarian 
assistance but none was required 
under expanded rules of engagement in effect since may 3 
us warships in the gulf have been permitted to intervene with 
force to stop attacks on neutral shipping in international waters 
provided they are not carrying warrelated materials and asked for 
assistance 
iranian gunboats had steered clear of the us ships attacking 
in locations too far away for the americans to intervene the july 
2 encounter involving the elmer montgomery was the first 
confrontation between us and iranian forces since the policy was 
broadened 
another on the next day involving the montgomery and the 
vincennes led indirectly to the jetliner disaster us officials 
said that clash began when a helicopter from the vincennes was 
fired on by iranian speedboats in the strait of homruz 
in a skirmish that followed the vincennes and the elmer 
montgomery sank two boats and damaged one just before the iran air 
airbus took off from bandar abbas for dubai with 290 people aboard 
the attack on the universal monarch was the second in a week by 
irans gunboats and apparently responded to two iraqi raids on 
iranian tankers thursday the shipping executives said 
elsewhere in the war iraq claimed its forces achieved their 
fourth major battlefield victory in three months tuesday by driving 
iranian troops out of their last stronghold in southern iraq 
irans islamic republic news agency claimed the iraqis used 
chemical weapons killing 25 soldiers and wounding more than 3600 
iraq which has acknowledged using such weapons in the past did 
not respond

jenny nicholson who says she believed 
union county commissioners were serious when they named her 
official astrologer quit tuesday because of the commotion her 
position created 
i think that maybe they wanted to make fun of me and make me 
look foolish ms nicholson said from her home in la grande 
ive worked 20 years doing what im doing im not foolish im 
very much a commonsense person 
this is a pisces town two fish swimming in opposite 
directions she said of the northeastern oregon community we 
dont need divisions here we need to come together i have no wish 
to upset anyone here i love my town 
ms nicholson said she mailed the county commission a letter 
monday informing them she was quitting the nonpaying post 
despite the letter the commission voted 30 tuesday to rescind 
the appointment 
the incident began when ms nicholson went to the newspaper in 
la grande a timber and farming community of about 12000 to tell 
them the stars were in a great position for the county to obtain 
federal and state grants 
county commissioners read the article and without ms 
nicholsons knowledge voted last week to appoint her to help find 
the right time to make their applications 
at the time county judge john howard who heads the commission 
said what the heck if the reagan administration is rumored as 
using astrology i guess we can try it on the local level as well 
howard said he was surprised by the publicity 
i viewed it as tongueincheek he said it was just kind 
of a gesture to lighten things up and create some conversation 
ms nicholson 38 who reads palms and develops astrological 
charts for a living said she has plenty of business thanks to the 
unexpected publicity 
she said she also would like to do astrological charts for 
communities and states as a public service 
she threw in her assessment of oregon 
oregon is an aquarius state and has a peculiar chart she 
said ours is not an easy destiny we are trend setters for the 
nation people will laugh at us make fun of us and for 50 years 
theyll be following our trends 
next spring she said the stars will be favorable for the state 
improving its education system 
the nation however is headed for tougher times she said 
weve got major hairy hairy aspects coming up beginning in

im a fellow born on a dirt road in a 
cottage down in south texas lloyd bentsen said tuesday 
but he doesnt look it six feet one or two trim silverhaired 
and adroit he looks more like texas wealth texas oil and texas 
slick than a fellow from a dirtroad cottage down on a farm 
michael dukakis choice for vice president is a quiet man 
impeccably tailored and his shoes always shined he has been 
married for 44 years to beryl ann ba bentsen once a 
highfashion model whose face appeared in vogue glamour and 
mademoiselle magazines 
an attorney and world war ii pilot who flew bombers over the 
third reich bentsen is described as shrewd and competitive 
fighting effectively to protect the favorable tax status of the 
texas oil industry and against the trade deficit 
dukakis introducing bentsen tuesday said the texan had hit a 
grand slam home run in the senate this session his committee 
producing a thoughtful responsible trade bill a welfare 
revision bill and a bill requiring firms to give workers 60 days 
notice before closing a plants 
bentsen appeals with equal ease to the men of power in corporate 
boardrooms and the farm workers of his native rio grande valley of 
texas he speaks spanish as fluently as english 
he is a conservative a protestant a washington insider 
bentsen 67 describes himself as one who has always been able 
to build a consensus and as proof points to legislation coming 
out of the senate finance committee with votes of 182 and 191 
i think the first impression of sen bentsen is he understands 
how you handle the halls of power the board rooms as well as the 
cloakrooms of america said rep ron coleman dtexas he knows 
how to get things done the good thing also is that he has the 
compassion for the disadvantaged 
his father lloyd millard bentsen sr a south dakota native a 
motorcycle racer and onetime harddrinker arrived in texas with 
5 in his pockets and built a financial dynasty in the 
citrusbearing lands of far south texas 
bentsen was elected to congress in 1948 at age 27 early in his 
house career he cast a vote that was seen as an act of courage he 
was only one of two texas representatives who voted to repeal the 
poll tax 
in the house he once suggested that thenpresident dwight 
eisenhower threaten north korea with nuclear bombs unless they 
withdraw their forces north of the 38th parallel 
after six years in the house in the late 1940s and 1950s 
bentsen returned to texas and to make a fortune in houston with 
his fathers help he founded lincoln consolidated an insurance 
holding company which controlled stock worth hundreds of millions 
of dollars 
in 1970 he decided to run for the senate he successfully 
challenged the democratic incumbent sen ralph yarborough who was 
something of a populist and represented the liberal wing of the 
democratic party bentsen accused yarborough of supporting the 
violence which occurred during antivietnam war demonstrations at 
the 1968 democratic presidential convention to make his point he 
ran commercials replaying the street warfare of chicago 
in the general election he defeated george bush then a houston 
congressman now the certain republican presidential nominee 
bentsen says one of his greatest strengths has been an across 
the board spectrum of support with mexicanamericans as the base 
but in his race against bush bentsen lost most of the minority 
voters in texas winning big in rural areas and among bluecollar 
democrats 
he is certainly the mind behind a tremendously effective 
political machine in texas not a party operation but a bentsen 
operation he is the man that pulls the people together and makes 
it run said a capitol hill republican tuesday speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
bentsen is a tremendous fundraiser outdistancing all other 
candidates for congress so far this year according to federal 
election commission reports the fec said bentsen had raised over 
5 million in the 15 months between jan 1 1987 and the end of 
march 1988 he also took in more political action committee money 
than any other candidate over 146 million 
he admitted he had made a doozy of a mistake early last year 
when he invited washington lobbyists to pay 10000 for the 
privilege of joining him for breakfast once a month 
after deciding such contributions would reflect on my 
integrity and reflecting in the glow of intense publicity 
bentsen disbanded his chairmans council after only one session 
and returned the money to an estimated 40 lobbyists who had looked 
with pleasure at the prospect of breakfasting with the chairman of 
the senate committee that handles taxes 
yet bentsen has a longstanding policy of not accepting 
honoraria for speaking engagements and will rarely accept a gift 
during his years in the senate bentsen gradually moderated his 
views often voting for a broader federal role on social issues and 
gradually opposing the vietnam war 
we have fulfilled our commitment bentsen said in 1971 
three years before last us combat troops left 
on governments role bentsen says i think its terribly 
important that we invest in children and young people and do the 
utmost we can to make sure they are born with sound minds and 
bodies and given a good start in life 
we have two handicapped grandchildren of our own he says 
and thats part of the motivation you relate to those kinds of 
concerns and problems thats why i pushed so hard for prenatal and 
neonatal health care 
he was also behind trade legislation for years even when few 
others cared about the issue 
well you cant be a nation that is spending 104 percent of 
what you produce and thats what weve been doing and you have to 
turn that around increase production of our country that in turn 
raises the standing of living for your country he says thats 
why i pushed hard

prime minister eddie fenech adami of malta 
offered on tuesday to lead his mediterranean island nation back 
into the mainstream of west european traditions but not as a 
tool of war 
he also appealed for foreign investment saying it was essential 
for the survival of the mediterranean nation we do not feel 
investment is a dirty word fenech adami said in a speech at the 
american enterprise institute a private research group 
he said investors would get a privileged welcome but did 
not specify the steps malta was prepared to take to attract foreign 
capital 
malta emerged from british rule in 1964 and sought to retain its 
military ties with the north atlantic treaty organization it had 
been a british base during world war ii 
but nato declined to give malta observer status in the 
western alliance under former prime minister don mintoff the 
country veered away from the west and established military ties 
with libya which were disavowed after fenech adamis election last 
year 
the maltese leader said economic ties with libya would be 
retained as part of a general policy of neutrality but he said 
we are not ideologically neutral where freedom and human rights 
are concerned 
maltas constitution prohibits foreign bases on maltese soil 
malta is no longer offering itself as a tool of war but is 
opening its arms wide to those with a spirit of enterprise 
fenech adami said 
the maltese leader arrived sunday for a week of talks with 
reagan administration officials it is the first visit to 
washington by a leader of the country in 25 years on wednesday

following the path to victory forged by another massachusettstexas 
team john kennedy and lyndon johnson in 1960 
jesse jackson passed over for the job he openly sought said he 
was too controlledand too mature to be angry he said his 
name would be placed in nomination for president against dukakis 
next wednesday but added i no doubt will support the ticket 
that the convention elects next week 
there was no immediate reaction from bush although he said in a 
boston globe interview published earlier in the day that bentsen 
doesnt worry me despite the democrats victory in a 1970 
headtohead senate race senate gop leader bob dole said dukakis 
couldnt have picked a better man 
in atlanta party officials said construction work would be 
finished on the omni convention hall ahead of schedule and a few 
days before thousands of delegates begin streaming into the 
convention city over the weekend 
dukakis presented bentsen in ceremony televised live from 
swletering faneuil hall in boston a large crowd of supporters 
stood outside in the afternoon sunshine waiting for a glimpse of 
the democratic ticket for 1988 
we go to atlanta and we begin the road to victory dukakis 
said his choice of bentsen must be ratified by the delegates to 
the convention that begins on monday and there is no doubt he will 
have his way regardless of whether jackson or his delegates decide 
to seek a symbolic showdown 
one jackson supporter in congress rep john conyers of 
michigan said the selection disappointed and shocked him it 
may be that were back in the mondalecarter syndrome of trying to 
make the democratic party only slightly less conservative than the 
republican party he said 
but the two ticket mates said they were on the road to the white 
house 
said bentsen 
the massachusetts and the texas axis was good for the country 
and good for the democratic party in 1960 and its gonna be a real 
winner in 1988 
dukakis said selecting a running mate is probably the first 
presidential act if i could use those words that i will do in 
choosing bentsen he hoped the partys liberal wing would go along 
bentsen 67 is chairman of the senate finance committee and a 
consummate party insider he is a moderate who differs with dukakis 
on some issues most prominently perhaps in his support for aid to 
the nicaraguan contras 
despite bushs professed lack of concern republican strategists 
said that in turning to bentsen dukakis had transformed one of 
bushs strongest states into an autumn battleground texas has 29 
electoral votes more than any state except california and new 
york and no democrat has been elected president this century 
without carrying it 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater said he was unconcerned 
he said democrats have thrown away the vice presidential 
selection because they cannot wrest texas away from the 
republicans people in texas want a president not a vice 
president and george bush is the man they want he said 
among those considered and then passed over for the vice 
presidential slot were jackson sens john glenn of ohio albert 
gore jr of tennessee bob graham of texas and reps richard 
gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton of missouri sen bill 
bradley of new jersey and sam nunn of georgia told dukakis they did 
not want to be considered 
bentsen is a prodigious fundraiser and owner of a moderate to 
conservative voting record after nearly a quarter century in the 
house and senate 
the selection was reminiscent of the 1960 campaign when another 
son of massachusetts john f kennedy turned to texan lyndon 
johnson in a drive for votes in the south johnson helped the 
ticket win texas and other states that year and sen edward m 
kennedy provided an echo of that past campaign after hearing of 
bentsens selection 
the massachusettstexas combination got this country moving 
again in 1960 and it will do the same for the nation in 1988 
said the senator in a statement 
much of the democratic establishment moved to embrace bentsen 
democratic prospects in texas oklahoma and louisiana will be 
boosted immediately and when the american people get to know lloyd 
bentsen it will strengthen the ticket everywhere said sen paul 
simon of illinois a liberal and former primary rival of dukakis 
john white a former democratic national chairman who has been 
advising jackson said he was excited about the choice of 
bentsen and said it would make texas a hell of a battlefield 
asked if he would convince jackson about the merits of bentsen 
white replied jesses a very quick study im not worried about 
that 
at his news conference an obviously subdued jackson said he 
first learned of bentsens selection from a reporter but dukakis 
called him a short while later and told him on the telephone he 
said he would press his case for the nomination as well as for 
changes in the barebones platform drafted by dukakis forces 
there was no hint of whether jackson or his 1100 delegates 
would challenge the nomination at the democratic national 
convention next week 
rep lynn martin rill who is national cochairwoman of 
bushs presidential campaign tried to dampen the historical 
connection 
im sure were going to hear 1960 ad nauseum she said 
theres a slight difference of course he bentsen was not 
selected by his peers to be in leadership as lyndon johnson the 
senate majority leader had been nor is dukaks john kennedy 
public polls taken recently indicate that bentsen is little 
known nationally but could give dukakis an enormous boost in the 
race for texas one survey shows bush routing dukakis by more than 
20 percentage points in the lone star state with the margin 
dwindling to four percentage points if bentsen were placed on the 
ticket 
the selection of bentsen followed a sixweek search for a 
partner for the fall campaign that was focused almost exclusively 
on members of congress from the south and midwest its kind of 
fun this business of running for the presidency said dukakis as 
he arrived at his statehouse office a few hours before the 
midafternoon announcement 
for the methodical and serious dukakis that sounded like a 
whoop of joy that his long search was over and that his secret 
had held 
bush campaigned during the day at an naacp convention in 
washington where he promised to have a positive civil rights 
agenda if he succeeds president reagan in office 
i guarantee you i will be personally involved in protecting 
the civil rights of all americans bush said to loud applause 
from one of the nations most prominent civil rights groups

democrat michael dukakis tapped sen lloyd bentsen 
as his running mate tuesday setting up a homestate challenge to 
bentsens fellow texan george bush and stirring memories of the 
massachusettstexas connection that won the white house in 1960 
the parallels between 1960 and 1988 are very close indeed 
dukakis told a cheering crowd of supporters packed into the steamy 
hall then we had had eight rather amiable but sleepy years of 
republicans in the white house we had a country that was ready for 
change 
dukakis noted that the republicans nominated an incumbent vice 
president richard nixon in 1960 while the democrats chose sen 
john f kennedy of massachusetts and kennedy in turn tapped sen 
lyndon johnson of texas 
jack kennedy and lyndon johnson beat that incumbent vice 
president in 1960 and mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are going to 
beat them in 1988 dukakis said 
bentsen cheered by the partisan crowd as he stepped to the 
microphone echoed dukakis saying the massachusetts and the 
texas axis was good for the country and good for the democratic 
party in 1960 and its going to be a real winner in november of 
1988 
both men were accompanied by their wives kitty dukakis and 
beryl bentsen mrs dukakis appeared for the first time in public 
without her neck brace since her spinal surgery in early june and 
dukakis smiled at her and said doesnt my bride look fantastic 
without that collar on 
the four joined arms and posed for pictures on the stage in 
historic faneuil hall a structure that was built in 1742 and 
earned the nickname the cradle of liberty as a forum for 
revolutionaries in colonial america 
dukakis said bentsen brought to the democratic ticket years of 
experience and a deep commitment to civil rights that goes way 
back to the 1940s dukakis said bentsen the chairman of the 
senate finance committee stood for good jobs at good wages a 
central theme of his campaign 
bentsen said the fact that hes chosen a senator from texas 
a senator from the south shows that were going to fight for every 
state in the union and were going all out to win he said 
dukakis a son of greek immigrants was living out his parents 
dream but wants that dream a reality for all americans 
from faneuil hall dukakis took bentsen to the statehouse where 
they spoke briefly to both chambers of the massachusetts 
legislature they then went to a gathering in boston of state 
democratic chairmen from across the country 
dukakis in selecting bentsen served notice he would not 
concede texas and its 29 electoral votes to bush who calls the 
state his home dukakis also added washington experience and 
philosophical and geographical balance to the democratic ticket 
the massachusetts governor made the choice late monday at a 
meeting with paul brountas his longtime confidant and campaign 
manager susan estrich 
he called bentsen tuesday morning and after the senator agreed 
to join the ticket went to his statehouse office to telephone the 
six other men who were being considered for the vice presidential 
nomination said sources who spoke to the associated press on the 
condition they not be identified by name 
still jesse jackson whose actions could be critical to 
democratic hopes for a harmonious convention told reporters he 
knew nothing of the choice until they told him it was being 
reported several hours before dukakis announced it in boston 
he said dukakis later phoned him but they did not have a lengthy 
discussion asked if he was angry about being passed over jackson 
replied no im too controlled im too clear im too mature to 
be angry he called the selection of bentsen a strategic move 
bentsen already has done what dukakis hopes to do in the fall 
defeat bush bentsens win came in a 1970 run for the senate seat 
he now holds 
bush recently said that bentsen doesnt worry me and 
predicted he would carry texas in november even if bentsen was 
dukakis running mate 
bentsen an elegantly tailored silverhaired patrician is the 
scion of a wealthy landed family from the rio grande valley and a 
leading member of the senate democratic establishment 
the senator like dukakis has been a politician most of his 
adult life winning election to the us house in 1948 at the age 
of 27 but he is no dukakis clone having supported aid for 
nicaraguas contra rebels which dukakis has decried as a failed 
and illegal policy 
bentsen is up for reelection to his senate seat in november 
and if he chooses could run for both offices at once a precedent 
set by johnson in 1960 
bentsen has been a central figure in congress battle with 
president reagan over trade legislation an issue democrats plan 
to play heavily in this falls campaign his committee also 
oversees tax legislation and the welfare reform bill currently 
before a housesenate conference committee 
bentsen mounted a 1976 run for the democratic presidential 
nomination but excited little interest in 1984 he was on 
democratic nominee walter mondales list of possible running mates 
he created a brief furor in february 1987 when it was revealed 
that he had asked lobbyists to pay 10000 apiece to join him for 
breakfast once a month the breakfast club called the chairmans 
council held one meeting and was quickly disbanded bentsen 
returned the money collected from an estimated 40 lobbyists

this year as arson although authorities had not determined the 
cause spokesman scott lagreca said

an amish man jailed for refusing to 
display an orange slowmovingvehicle sign on his horsedrawn buggy 
was exempted from wearing the orange jump suit normally worn by 
inmates 
gideon hershberger 62 served seven days in the fillmore county 
jail for contempt of court and was released tuesday 
hershberger and other amish contend that displaying the orange 
signs is against their religion 
id say its the most i can do he said i dont want to 
be stubborn but i will continue without the sign what else can i 
do 
county sheriff don gudmundson allowed hershberger to wear his 
blue denim pants deep blue cotton shirt and navy blue suspenders 
district court judge margaret shaw johnson ruled earlier this 
month that public safety overrides the amish resistance to the 
orange triangle 
religion is not a defense in this case she said 
hershberger said the amish prefer to trust god over worldly 
symbols and they want to live the way their forefathers lived 
some amish use orange triangles but others use a black triangle 
with a white outline and some of the older more conservative 
members like hershberger use no sign at all they prefer to outline 
their buggies with white reflective tape 
hershberger spent his jail time working in a woodworking shop 
and reading 
gudmundson is sympathetic to hershberger and other amish 
violators 
they say they dont want to create problems for me or the 
state which they are he said but this is something i admire 
them for even though i cant agree with it

lee atwater republican george bushs campaign 
manager said tuesday that democrats have thrown away the vice 
presidential selection with michael dukakis choice of sen lloyd 
bentsen as his running mate 
after all is said and done theyre not going to win texas 
atwater said in an interview people in texas want a president 
not a vice president and george bush is the man they want 
bush en route to baseballs allstar game in cincinnati told 
reporters thats interesting thats what i think about it 
when asked about the bentsen selection 
atwater said he was delighted with the choice of bentsen saying 
if i were selecting the nominee i couldnt have done better 
myself 
he claimed that nearly any of the other prominent democrats 
mentioned as a possible vice president including sens john glenn 
of ohio and albert gore of tennessee as well as jesse jackson 
would have posed a greater challenge to the gop ticket this fall 
the democrats have thrown away the vice presidential selection 
as far as im concerned he will help some in texas but only 
enough to get them democrats to spend a whole bunch of time and 
money down there that theyre going to end up squandering away 
bushs campaign manager said that the selection of bentsen may 
give democrats a surge in the polls in texas but that will 
settle down and after all is said and done george bush is going to 
win texas 
he dismissed comparisons to the 1960 democratic ticket that also 
had a massachusettstexas breakdown with president john f kennedy 
and lyndon b johnson 
if it was like 1960 then well win handily because the south 
in 1960 was solidly for nixon now the south is going to be solidly 
for bush atwater said 
democrats will be saying that ad nauseam rep lynn martin 
rill national cochairwoman of the bush campaign said in 
reference to the comparison of the two tickets 
but its a little different running for president and vice 
president than running for the senate were talking about 
different sets of experiences his bentsens experience has been 
in finance you dont think of him as being strong either in terms 
of social issues or in terms of foreign policy frankly mrs 
martin sid 
bentsen defeated bush in a 1970 senate race but bush aides 
insisted that fact would not trouble the certain 1988 gop 
presidential nominee 
bush himself did not mention the selection of bentsen in a 
morning speech to a convention of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people 
bush had said he wanted to wait to see whom the democrats would 
pick for the no 2 spot on their ticket before giving thought to a 
running mate atwater said bush still intends to delay his own 
choice of a running mate until the republican national convention 
in august 
but mrs martin said the selection of bentsen does not make 
much difference in terms of the dynamics for the gop ticket 
the one thing it does is it allows george bush the same 
freedom he had yesterday i dont think the selection of bentsen 
without diminishing the senator at all is one that says now bush 
has to do x y or z she said 
mrs martin said that bentsen was not that well known outside 
washington or texas other than being identified as kind of big 
oil and breakfasts breakfasts at tiffanys sortofthing a 
reference to bentsens shortlived effort to organize breakfasts 
with lobbyists who were to pay 10000 each 
i still think george bush will carry texas mrs martin 
said you never underestimate an opponent on the other hand i 
suspect no ones in raging fear either

legislators of a mountain enclave that has been 
involved in an ethnic tugofwar for months voted tuesday to secede 
from azerbaijan and join armenia a dramatic first in soviet 
politics but probably futile 
the legislature of nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian 
enclave in azerbaijan was unanimous except for one abstention in 
the decision to secede and rename the area the artsakh autonomous 
region of armenia radio reporters in the territory reported 
about 160000 people live in nagornokarabakh and threequarters 
are ethnic armenians 
dissident historian roy medvedev said the legislative action 
appears to have little chance of success 
its unconstitutional he said it cannot be considered 
legal 
never before in soviet history has a regions legislature voted 
to withdraw from the republic of which it is a part he said 
the decision defies central authorities all the way up to 
mikhail s gorbachev and tests kremlin tolerance of assertions of 
rights by the countrys more than 100 national groups gorbachev 
has encouraged citizens to speak out under his policy of glasnost 
or openness 
the soviet constitution gives citizens the right to 
selfdetermination but also requires that a republic consent to 
any change in its boundaries 
nagornokarabakh is an autonomous region of azerbaijan which is 
soviet armenias neighbor in the caucasus 
its legislature asked feb 20 that the azerbaijani and armenian 
governments approve the transfer to armenia the armenians agreed 
june 15 but azerbaijans legislature rejected the request two days 
later 
strikes and street rallies have disrupted stepanakert the 
territorial capital for weeks 
a statement by the legislature read over the telephone by 
reporters for the stepanakert radio station said the soviet of 
peoples deputies of the nagornokarabakh autonomous region 
declares its secession from the azerbaijan soviet socialist 
republic 
armenians most of whom are christians consider 
nagornokarabakh part of their ancestral homeland but in 1923 the 
region was assigned to azerbaijan which is predominantly moslem 
the dispute began with demonstrations by armenians in both 
nagornokarabakh and armenia itself in february and ethnic riots 
were reported in sumgait an azerbaijan port officials said 32 
people were killed 26 armenians and six azerbaijanis and 200 
injured 
gorbachev told a national communist party conference june 28 the 
powers of the countrys 15 republics and other ethnic entities 
should be expanded but said some ethnic minorities were going too 
far 
some think that any questions from the redrawing of borders 
to the establishment of opposition parties can be resolved 
through glasnost gorbachev said 
the central committee believes such abuses of democratization 
run counter to the task of perestroika contradict the peoples 
interests he said perestroika or restructuring is what 
gorbachev calls his plans for social and economic reform 
communist party officials in moscow rejected the territorial 
demand in february but said living conditions in nagornokarabakh 
would be improved 
the kremlin approved a multimilliondollar package of social and 
cultural improvements for the region in march but strikes and 
demonstrations continued 
after azerbaijan rejected the transfer request 
nagornokarabakhs legislature proposed a compromise putting the 
region under temporary control of the central government in moscow 
armenian delegates to the party conference in moscow suggested 
other compromises that included attaching the region to stavropol 
gorbachevs home district in the russian republic 
azerbaijans leaders did not budge 
medvedev said in a telephone interview that tuesdays decision 
appeared aimed at pressuring moscow into approving the territorial 
transfer 
pravda the communist party newspaper said on tuesday an 
overwhelming majority of armenians who began a strike july 4 in 
yerevan the armenian capital had decided to return to work 
dissident journalist mofses gorgisyan said the walkout was 
gaining strength however and that representatives of factories in 
the republic of 34 million people reported 70 percent absenteeism 
monday 
he said by telephone from yerevan that soldiers and tanks were 
deployed around the citys outskirts and militiamen patrolled 
inside the city limits 
the central committee of armenias communist party criticized 
officials throughout the republic tuesday for delaying showing 
carelessness and irresponsibility in the realization of practical 
measures aimed at improving the situation the government 
newspaper izvestia reported 
gorgisyan said 300000 to 400000 people gathered outside 
armenias institute of ancient manuscripts known as the 
matenadaran on monday night to support the strike and press the 
territorial demand a reporter for the republics official news 
agency armenpress said the number was about 100000 
gorgisyan 27 belongs to an underground group called the 
alliance for national selfdetermination and publishes an 
underground journal called fatherland

michigan rep john j conyers and three other 
congressmen on tuesday introduced a bill that would ban the export 
of most american waste 
the legislation would cover any hazardous waste waste oil 
incinerator ash and other forms of solid waste with some 
exceptions for material that would be recycled in the country 
receiving it violators would be subject to as much as two years in 
prison and fines of 50000 with both to be doubled on a second 
offense 
conyers a democrat said at a news conference that the 
legislation would apply to both rich and poor countries he 
emphasized the effect of us waste exports in the third world 
calling them an act of toxic terrorism he said poor countries 
could be tempted by the offer of large sums by us companies 
according to jim vallette a researcher for greenpeace eight 
industrial countries have received us waste since 1986 
australia finland canada japan netherlands sweden britain and 
west germany vallette added that some of the waste shipped to 
third world countries has gone through italy 
a greenpeace report said that britain has become a major 
recipient of waste from europe the united states and recently from 
new zealand largely because fees for its waste disposal are much 
lower than in continental europe 
the greenpeace report said at least 11 third world countries 
have received waste from the united states and europe in that 
period brazil guinea lebanon sierra leone syria venezuela 
mexico nigeria south africa zimbabwe and haiti 
conyers a democrat was joined by two other democrats reps 
james j florio of new jersey and chester g atkins of 
massachusetts and republican rep jim leach of iowa in 
sponsoring the bill it would exempt canada and mexico from the 
export ban because they have agreements with the us government on 
waste disposal

michael dukakis choice of texas sen lloyd 
bentsen as his vice presidential nominee balances the geographical 
and ideological scales of the democratic ticket and provides a 
staunch challenge to george bush in a state the vice president 
calls his home 
they are trying to break bushs back in texas said 
republican pollster lance tarrance 
indeed its almost as if texas is suddenly the only state that 
counts for the democrats the convention chairman is from texas 
house speaker jim wright the keynote speaker is from texas state 
treasurer ann richards and now the vice presidential choice 
they havent just taken a bow toward texas they 
genuflected said democratic consultant mark mellman dukakis has 
made a very big investment in texas he added we better win 
it now 
a key question is whether bentsen does anything for the 
democratic ticket outside texas 
one argument is that he will reassure the white southern males 
who have deserted the party by the millions in recent elections 
persuading them the democrats are not too liberal and concerned 
with minorities and special interests 
but the flip side is that bentsen is little known outside his 
home state except in louisiana and oklahoma except for those 
three states he might not make any difference but then vice 
presidential candidates rarely make much of a difference since the 
focus is on the presidential candidates 
texas holds 29 electoral votes more than 10 percent of the 278 
needed to win the white house in november the state ranks third 
behind only california and new york 
that is clearly the central reason for choosing bentsen over the 
other names on dukakis short list historians are fond of saying 
democrats have not won the presidency in this century without 
winning texas what is less often said is that winning texas does 
not guarantee a democratic victory hubert humphrey won the lone 
star state in 1968 for example and still lost to richard nixon 
bush calls texas his home still voting there even though the 
only home he actually owns these days is on the coastline of maine 
it makes texas a battleground where before bush had texas 
sewn up said republican strategist vince breglio its a direct 
shot at the republicans natural base for the presidential contest 
the more time and money the democrats can force the republicans 
to spend winning states in the south where the gop national 
ticket has been strong in recent years the less time and money 
bush and his running mate will be able to spend in california 
illinois ohio michigan pennsylvania and new york 
now bush must face his choice of a running mate 
he could choose to counter the democratic thrust in the south by 
picking someone from the region for the no 2 spot like former 
tennessee gov lamar alexander or he can make a move into the 
northeast which should be dukakis strong area with a choice 
such as rep jack kemp of new york 
bush can also go to california and try to nail down that states 
47 electoral votes with gov george deukmejian as a running mate 
or he can mend fences in the midwest with senate gop leader bob 
dole of kansas 
dukakis choice of bentsen broadens the democratic appeal in 
crucial ways for the fall campaign 
the liberal massachusetts governor will be running with the 
conservative washington insider from the southwest 
the specialist in economic growth is paired with the legislative 
expert with a reputation in international economics 
the opponent of aid to the contras chose a supporter of such 
funding 
it cuts down the angle at which bush can shoot said 
democratic pollster peter hart they cant say the ticket is 
inexperienced or too liberal 
bentsen will certainly help the democratic party reach out to 
conservative businessmen who have rarely backed the partys 
hopefuls bentsen has been masterful at gathering campaign 
contributions from normally gop sources a fact that has 
republicans awed and a bit peeved

we the people of the democratic party of the united states of 
america in order to initiate the changes necessary to keep america 
strong and make america better in order to restore competence 
caring and incorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get 
it working again fairly for all americans and in order to secure 
for our children a future of liberty and opportunity hereby pledge 
our party our leaders our elected officials and our every 
individual effort to fulfilling the following fundamental 
principles for all members of the american family 
we believe that all americans have a fundamental right to 
economic justice in a stronger surer national economy an economy 
that must grow steadily without inflation that can generate a 
rising standard of living for all and fulfill the desire of all to 
work in dignity up to their full potential in good health with good 
jobs at good wages an economy that is prosperous in every region 
from coast to coast including our rural towns and our older 
industrial communities our mining towns our energy producing 
areas and the urban areas that have been neglected for the past 
seven years 
we believe that as a firstrate world power moving into the 
21st century we can have a firstrate full employment economy 
with an indexed minimum wage that can help lift and keep families 
out of poverty with training and employment programs including 
child care and health care that can help people move from welfare 
to work with portable pensions and an adequate social security 
system safeguarded against emasculation and privatization that 
can help assure a comfortable and fulfilling old age with 
opportunities for voluntary national public service above and 
beyond current services that can enrich our communities and with 
all workers assured the protection of an effective law that 
guarantees their rights to organize join the union of their 
choice and bargain collectively with their employer free from 
antiunion tactics 
we believe that the time has come for america to take charge 
once again of its economic future to reverse seven years of 
voodoo economics trickle down policies fiscal 
irresponsibility and economic violence against poor and working 
people that have converted this proud country into the worlds 
largest debtor nation mortgaged our childrens future by tripling 
our national debt placed home ownership out of reach for most 
young families permitted the rise of poverty and homelessness on 
the streets of america reduced the buying power of working men and 
women and witnessed the decline of our industrial natural 
resource and mining base the unending tragedy of family farm 
foreclosures an unhealthy dependence on foreign energy and foreign 
capital and the increasing foreign ownership of our land and 
natural resources 
we believe that it is time for america within a strong 
commitment to fiscal responsibility to reassert progressive values 
and reinvest in its people to invest in new priorities in 
lifelong education and training in targeted economic development 
in a healthy small business community and in retooled american 
industry that it is time for the broad revitalization of home town 
america involving financial institutions in the provision of 
crucial credit by encouraging special commitments in exchange for 
bailing out those that are failing reforming and expanding 
community reinvestment laws and reversing the trend of financial 
concentration and deregulation all combining to reverse the 
insecurity that has increasingly troubled our workers and their 
families in this rapidly changing society that has left some 
communities and regions behind 
there is no good reason why the nation we love the greatest and 
richest nation on earth should rank first among the industrialized 
nations in output per person but nearly last in infant mortality 
first in the percentage of total expenditures devoted to defense 
but nearly last in the percentage devoted to education and housing 
we believe that government should set the standard in 
recognizing that worker productivity is enhanced by the principle 
of pay equity for working women and no substandard wage competition 
for public contracts by family leave policies that no longer force 
employees to choose between their jobs and their children or ailing 
parents by safe and healthy work places now jeopardized by seven 
callous years of lowered and unenforced occupational safety 
standards for american workers and by major increases in 
assistance making child care more available and affordable to 
lowand middleincome families helping states build a strong child 
care infrastructure setting minimum standards for health safety 
and quality and thereby enabling parents to work and their 
children to get an early start on their education and personal 
fulfillment 
we believe that the strength of our families is enhanced by 
programs to prevent abuse and malnutrition among children crime 
dropouts and pregnancy among teenagers and violence in the family 
by aggressive child support enforcement and by emphasizing family 
preservation and quality foster care 
we believe that america needs more trade fair trade an 
administration willing to use all the tools available to better 
manage our trade in order to export more american goods and fewer 
american jobs an administration willing to recognize in the 
formulation and enforcement of our trade laws that workers rights 
are important human rights abroad as well as at home and that 
advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs is not only 
fundamentally right but also economically sound we believe that we 
can and must improve our competitiveness in the world economy 
using our best minds to create the most advanced technology in the 
world through a greater commitment to civilian research and 
development and to science engineering and mathematics training 
through more publicprivate and businesslabor cooperation and 
mutual respect through more intergovernmental partnerships and 
through a better balance between fiscal and monetary policy and 
between military and civilian research and development 
we further believe in halting such irresponsible corporate 
conduct as unproductive takeovers monopolistic mergers insider 
trading and golden parachutes for executives by reinvigorating our 
antitrust and securities laws reviewing large mergers and 
discouraging shortterm speculation taking place at the expense of 
longterm investment

we believe that the education of our citizens from head start 
to institutions of higher learning deserves our highest priority 
and that history will judge the next administration less by its 
success in building new weapons of war than by its success in 
improving young minds we believe that this nation needs to invest 
in its children on the front side of life by expanding the 
availability of preschool education for children at risk to 
invest in its teachers through training and enrichment programs 
including a national teacher corps to recruit teachers for 
tomorrow especially minorities with scholarships today to commit 
itself for the first time to the principle that no one should be 
denied the opportunity to attend college for financial reasons to 
ensure equal access to education by providing incentives and 
mechanisms for the equalization of financing among local school 
districts within each state to reverse cuts made in compensatory 
reading math and enrichment services to low income children and 
to expand support for bilingual education historically black and 
hispanic institutions the education of those with special needs 
the arts and humanities and an aggressive campaign to end 
illiteracy 
we believe that illegal drugs pose a direct threat to the 
security of our nation from coast to coast invading our 
neighborhoods classrooms homes and communities large and small 
that every arm and agency of government at every federal state and 
local level including every useful diplomatic military 
educational medical and law enforcement effort necessary should 
at long last be mobilized and coordinated with private efforts 
under the direction of a national drug czar to halt both the 
international supply and the domestic demand for illegal drugs now 
ravaging our country and that the legalization of illicit drugs 
would represent a tragic surrender in a war we intend to win we 
believe that this effort should include comprehensive programs to 
educate our children at the earliest ages on the dangers of alcohol 
and drug abuse readily available treatment and counseling for 
those who seek to address their dependency the strengthening of 
vital interdiction agencies such as the us coast guard and 
customs a summit of western hemispheric nations to coordinate 
efforts to cut off drugs at the source and foreign development 
assistance to reform drugbased economics by promoting crop 
substitution 
we believe that the federal government should provide increased 
assistance to local criminal justice agencies enforce a ban on 
cop killer bullets that have no purpose other than the killing 
and maiming of law enforcement officers reinforce our commitment 
to help crime victims and assume a leadership role in securing the 
safety of our neighborhoods and homes we further believe that the 
repeated toleration in washington of unethical and unlawful greed 
among too many of those who have been governing our nation 
procuring our weapons and polluting our environment has made far 
more difficult the daily work of the local policemen teachers and 
parents who must convey to our children respect for justice and 
authority 
we believe that we honor our multicultural heritage by assuring 
equal access to government services employment housing business 
enterprise and education to every citizen regardless of race sex 
national origin religion age handicapping condition or sexual 
orientation that these rights are without exception too precious 
to be jeopardized by federal judges and justice department 
officials chosen during the past seven years by a political party 
increasingly monolithic both racially and culturally more for 
their unenlightened ideological views than for their respect for 
the rule of law we further believe that we must work for the 
adoption of the equal rights amendment to the constitution that 
the fundamental right of reproductive choice should be guaranteed 
regardless of ability to pay that our machinery for civil rights 
enforcement and legal services to the poor should be rebuilt and 
vigorously utilized and that our immigration policy should be 
reformed to promote fairness nondiscrimination and family 
reunification and to reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech 
association and travel 
we further believe that the voting rights of all minorities 
should be protected the recent surge in hate violence and negative 
stereotyping combated the discriminatory englishonly pressure 
groups resisted our treaty commitments with native americans 
enforced by culturally sensitive officials and the lingering 
effects of past discrimination eliminated by affirmative action 
including goals timetables and procurement setasides 
we believe that the housing crisis of the 1980s must be halted 
a crisis that has left this country battered by a rising tide of 
homelessness unprecedented since the great depression by a 
tightening squeeze on low and moderateincome families that is 
projected to leave 7 million people without affordable housing by 
1993 and by a bleak outlook for young working families who cannot 
afford to buy their first home we believe that steps should be 
taken to ensure a decent place to live for every american 
we believe that homelessness a national shame should be 
ended in america that the supply of affordable housing should be 
expended in order to avoid the projected shortfall that 
employerassisted housing and development by community based 
nonprofit organizations should be encouraged that the inventory 
of public and subsidized housing should be renovated preserved and 
increased that foreclosed government property should be restored 
to productive use and that firsttime homebuyers should be 
assisted 
we believe that we can rebuild america creating good jobs at 
good wages through a national reinvestment strategy to construct 
new housing repair our sewers rebuild our roads and replace our 
bridges we believe that we must pursue needed investment through 
innovative partnerships and creative financing mechanisms such as a 
voluntary program to invest a portion of public and private pension 
funds as a steady source of investment capital by guaranteeing 
security and a fair rate of return and assuring sound project 
management

we believe that all americans should enjoy access to affordable 
comprehensive health services for both the physically and mentally 
ill from prenatal care for pregnant women at risk to more adequate 
care for our vietnam and other veterans from wellbaby care to 
childhood immunization to medicare that federal coordination and 
leadership are necessary to contain health care costs while 
assuring quality care and advanced medical research that quality 
affordable longterm home and health care should be available to 
all senior and disabled citizens allowing them to live with 
dignity in the most appropriate setting that an important first 
step toward comprehensive health services is to ensure that every 
family should have the security of basic health insurance and that 
the hivaids epidemic is an unprecedented public health emergency 
requiring increased support for accelerated research on and 
expedited fda approval of treatments and vaccines comprehensive 
education and prevention compassionate patient care adoption of 
the public health community consensus on voluntary and confidential 
testing and counseling and protection of the civil rights of those 
suffering from aids or aidsrelated complex or testing positive for 
the hiv antibody 
we believe that the last seven years have witnessed an 
unprecedented assault on our national interest and national 
security through the poisoning of our air with acid rain the 
dumping of toxic wastes into our water and the destruction of our 
parks and shores that pollution must be stopped at the source by 
shifting to new environmentally sound manufacturing and farming 
technologies that the federal government must promote recycling as 
the best least costly way to solve the trash crisis aggressively 
enforce toxic waste laws and require polluters to be responsible 
for future cleanup costs that this nation must redouble its 
efforts to provide clean waterways sound water management and safe 
drinkable ground water throughout the country that our national 
parks forests wildlife refuges and coastal zones must be 
protected and used only in an environmentally sound manner that 
all offshore oil drilling in environmentally sensitive areas should 
be opposed and that regular world environment summits should be 
convened by the united states to address the depletion of the ozone 
layer the greenhouse effect the destruction of tropical 
forests and other global threats and to create a global action plan 
for environmental restoration 
we believe that all americans producers and consumers alike 
benefit when food and fiber are produced not by a few large 
corporations and conglomerates but by hundreds of thousands of 
family farmers obtaining a fair price for their product that the 
disastrous farm policies of the last seven years despite record 
federal spending have forced hundreds of thousands of families 
from their farms while others are struggling to survive and that a 
workable agricultural policy should include supply management 
reasonable price supports soil conservation and protection of 
rural water quality credit and foreclosure relief the return of 
federally held foreclosed lands to minority beginning and 
restarting farmers the development of new uses and markets for 
american farm products improved disaster relief and the 
revitalization of rural america through new sources of capital for 
rural business and new federal support for rural health care 
housing education water supply and infrastructure 
we further believe that no person should go to bed hungry and 
that we must renew the fight against hunger at home and abroad 
make food available to those nations who need it and want it and 
convene an international conference of food producing nations 
we believe that a balanced coherent energy policy based on 
dependable supplies at reasonable prices is necessary to protect 
our national security ensure a clean environment and promote 
stable economic growth and prosperity both nationally and in our 
energy producing regions that the inevitable transition from our 
present nearly total dependence on increasingly scarce and 
environmentally damaging nonrenewable sources to renewable sources 
should begin now that such a policy includes increased cooperation 
with our hemispheric neighbors filling that strategic petroleum 
reserve promoting the use of natural gas methanol and ethanol as 
alternative transportation fuels encouraging the use of our vast 
natural gas and coal reserves while aggressively developing clean 
coal technology to combat acid rain and providing targeted new 
incentives for new oil and gas drilling and development for the 
development of renewable and alternative sources of energy and for 
the promotion of energy conservation 
we believe that with these changes the country could reduce its 
reliance on nuclear power while insisting that all plants are safe 
environmentally sound and assured of safe waste disposal 
we believe that this countrys democratic processes must be 
revitalized by securing universal same day and mailin voter 
registration as well as registration on the premises of appropriate 
government agencies by preventing the misuse of atlarge 
elections the abuse of election day challenges and registration 
roll purges any undercounting in the national census and any 
dilution of the oneperson onevote principle by ending 
discrimination against public employees who are denied the right to 
full political participation by supporting statehood for the 
district of columbia by treating the offshore territories under 
our flag as full partners in spirit of the american political 
family by empowering the commonwealth of puerto rico with greater 
autonomy within its relationship with the united states to achieve 
the economic social and political goals of its people and by 
giving it just and fair participation in federal programs by 
assuring and pledging the full and equal access of women and 
minorities to elective office and party endorsement and by 
minimizing the domination and distortion of our election by moneyed 
interests 
we believe in a stronger america ready to make the tough choices 
of leadership in an everdangerous world militarily stronger in 
our overall defense and antiterrorist capabilities and in the 
cohesion of our military alliances economically stronger at home 
and in the global marketplace intellectually stronger in the 
advances of our schools science and technology and spiritually 
stronger in the principles we exemplify to the world 
we believe in a clearheaded toughminded decisive american 
foreign policy that will reflect the changing nature of threats to 
our security and respond to them in a way that reflects our values 
and the support of our people a foreign policy that will respect 
our constitution our congress and our traditional democratic 
principles and will in turn be respected for its quiet strength 
its bipartisan goals and its steadfast attention to the concerns 
and contributions of our allies and international organizations 
we believe that we must reassume a role of responsible active 
international leadership based upon our commitment to democracy 
human rights and a more secure world that this nation as the 
world power with the broadest global interests and concerns has a 
greater stake than any in building a world at peace and governed by 
law that we can neither police the world nor retreat from it and 
that to have reliable allies we must be a reliable ally

we believe that our national strength has been sapped by a 
defense establishment wasting money on duplicative and dubious new 
weapons instead of investing more in readiness and mobility that 
our national strength will be enhanced by more stable defense 
budgets and by a commitment from our allies to assume a greater 
share of the costs and responsibilities reqired to maintain peace 
and liberty and that as military spending and priorities change 
government should encourage the conversion of affected military 
facilities and the retraining of workers to facilitate the creation 
of new forms of communication space development and new peacetime 
growth and productivity 
we believe in an america neither gunshy nor triggerhappy 
that will promote peace and prevent war not by trading weapons 
for hostages not by sending brave americans to undefined missions 
in lebanon and honduras not by relaxing our vigilance on the 
assumption that longrange soviet interests have permanently 
changed not by toasting a tyrantlike marcos as a disciple of 
democracy but by maintaining a stable nuclear deterrent sufficient 
to counter any soviet threat by standing up to any american 
adversary whenever necessary and sitting down with him whenever 
possible by making clear our readiness to use force when force is 
required to protect our essential security commitments by testing 
the intentions of the new soviet leaders about arms control 
emigration human rights and other issues and by matching them not 
merely in rhetoric but in reciprocal initiatives and innovation in 
joint efforts to combat environmental threats explore peaceful 
uses of space and eradicate disease and poverty in the development 
world and in a mutual effort to transform the arms race that 
neither side can win into a contest for peoples minds a contest 
we know our side will win 
we believe in following up the inf treaty a commendable first 
step with mutual verifiable and enforceable agreements that will 
make significant reductions in strategic weapons in a way that 
diminishes the risk of nuclear attack by either superpower reduce 
conventional forces to lower and equivalent levels in europe 
requiring deeper cuts on the warsaw pact side ban chemical and 
space weapons in their entirety and halt all nuclear weapons 
testing while strengthening our efforts to prevent the spread of 
these weapons to other nations before the nightmare of nuclear 
terrorism engulfs us all 
we believe in an america that recognizes not only the realities 
of eastwest relations but the challenges and opportunities of the 
developing world that will support and strengthen international 
law and institutions promote human and political rights and 
measure them by one yardstick and work for economic growth and 
development we believe that we must provide leadership compassion 
and economic assistance to those nations stunted by overwhelming 
debt deprivation and austerity and that we must work to promote 
active agreements between developing and industrial countries and 
the major public and commercial lenders to provide debt relief and 
rekindle and sustain economic growth and democracy in latin 
america asia and the poorest continent africa which deserves 
special attention we further believe that we must enlist the trade 
surplus nations to join with us in supporting new aid initiatives 
to fuel growth in developing countries that though economically 
depressed are rich in human and natural potential 
we believe this country should work harder to stop the supplies 
of arms from both east and west that fuel conflict in regions 
such as the persian gulf and angola 
deeply disturbed that the current administration has too long 
abandoned the peace process in the middle east and consistently 
undermined it in central america we believe that this country 
maintaining the special relationship with israel founded upon 
mutually shared values and strategic interests should provide new 
leadership to deliver the promise of peace and security through 
negotiations that has been held out to israel and its neighbors by 
the camp david accords and to central america by the arias peace 
plan which calls for an end to the fighting national 
reconciliation guarantees of human rights democracy and 
security enabling the united states and other nations to focus on 
the pressing social and economic needs of the people of that region 
we further believe in pursuing a policy of economic cooperation 
instead of confrontation with mexico and our other hemispheric 
friends in helping all developing countries build their own 
peaceful democratic institutions free from foreign troops 
subversion and domination and free from domestic dictators and 
aggressors in honoring our treaty obligations and in using all 
the tools at our disposal including diplomacy trade aid food 
ideas and ideals to defend and enlarge the horizons of freedom on 
this planet 
we believe in an america that will promote human rights human 
dignity and human opportunity in every country on earth that will 
encourage free speech and association and decry oppression in 
nations friendly and unfriendly communist and noncommunist that 
will encourage our european friends to respect human rights and 
resolve their longstanding differences over north ireland and 
cyprus that will encourage wherever possible the forces of 
pluralism and democracy in eastern europe and that will support the 
struggle for human rights in asia 
we believe the apartheid regime in south africa to be a uniquely 
repressive regime ruthlessly deciding every aspect of public and 
private life by skin color engaging in unrelenting violence 
against its citizens at home and promoting naked aggression against 
its neighbors in africa 
we believe that the time has come to end all vestiges of the 
failed policy of constructive engagement to declare south africa a 
terrorist state to impose comprehensive sanctions upon its 
economy to lead the international community in participation in 
these actions and to determine a date certain by which united 
states corporations must leave south africa 
we further believe that to achieve regional security in southern 
africa we must press forcefully for namibias independence by 
calling for the end of south africas illegal occupation a cease 
fire and elections must end our counterproductive policy in angola 
and must offer support and further assistance to mozambique and 
other frontline states 
in sum we believe it is time for america to change and move 
forward again in the interest of all its families to turn away 
from an era in which too many of americas children have been 
homeless or hungry and invest in a new era of hope and progress an 
era of secure families in a secure america in a secure world 
we believe the american dream of opportunity for every citizen 
can be a reality for all americans willing to meet their own 
responsibilities to help make it come true 
we believe that governments at the national state and local 
level in partnerships between those levels and in partnerships 
with the private sector exist to help us solve our problems 
instead of adding to them we believe in competent pragmatic 
governments accountable to the people led by men and women 
dedicated not to self interest but to service motivated not by 
ideology but by american ideals governing not in a spirit of power 
and privilege but with a sense of compassion and community 
for many years in state and local capitals across this nation 
democrats have been successfully solving problems and helping 
people with exactly this kind of innovative government 
therefore the democratic party in convention assembled and 
united the party of hope and change and fairness for all hereby 
declares its readiness to end the stalemate in washington by 
challenging encouraging and inviting the american people 
challenging them to do their patriotic best to meet their community 
responsibilities encouraging them to protect and preserve their 
families our most precious assets and inviting them to join with 
us in leading the land we love to a brighter and still greater 
future of opportunity and justice for all

tuesday on a dozen or more issues including his call for higher 
taxes on the wealthy a pentagon freeze more spending on education 
and head start nofirstuse of nuclear weapons and palestinian 
selfdetermination 
he is expected however to take only three or four of his key 
issues to the floor for votes with 1135 delegates jackson can 
force debates on any issue but dukakiss majority of 2426 is

platform writers in denver commits the democrats to reverse 
seven years of voodoo economics to more stable defense 
budgets to advance notice of plant layoffs and to guaranteed

norton on her way to a meeting with jackson said the 
negotiations are going well 
the party in a memorandum appended to the document said to 
avoid delay in printing the platform all parties have agreed that 
the report on minority planks which is still under discussion 
will be available at the convention 
the proposed platform written with the help of onetime 
president kennedy speechwriter ted sorensen is onetenth the 
length of the 45000word tome the democrats ran on in 1984 party 
chairman paul g kirk jr said the democrats would be better served 
by a short visionary statement stripped of special interest 
language that discomfited some democrats and delighted republicans 
the platform titled the resoration of competence and the 
revival of hope endorses pay equity for working women and no 
substandard wage competition for public contracts major 
increases in child care aid for low and middleincome families 
an indexed minimum wage and a national teacher corps to recruit

for hostages not by sending brave americans to undefined missions 
in lebanon and honduras not by toasting a tyrant like marcos as 
a disciple of democracy but by maintaining a stable nuclear 
deterrent sufficient to counter any soviet threat the 
platform says 
it calls for reinvigorating the camp david peace process in the

the house trying to solve one of its toughest 
political issues voted 37439 tuesday to give the pentagon a 
chance to save money by shutting down unneeded military bases 
the chamber passed a complicated plan that involves having an 
independent commission decide which bases to close 
for too many years obsolete military bases have been treated 
as sacred cows and the country cannot afford this anymore rep 
chalmers wylie rohio told his colleagues the time has come 
for congress to stiffen its backbone 
the defense department estimates that between 2 billion and 5 
billion a year can be saved if the military is allowed to close 
installations it says are obsolete 
but bases mean jobs and since 1977 congress has enacted a stiff 
and complex series of laws that have prevented the pentagon from 
shutting down any of the 3800 military installations in the 
continental united states 
the plan approved tuesday calls for a ninemember commission 
which will makes its recommendations to president reagan by next 
dec 31 the president would then have until jan 16 four days 
before leaving office to either accept or reject the entire list 
he could not approve a partial list 
congress could block the closures by a majority vote in both the 
house and senate 
defense secretary frank c carlucci backs the plan and has 
already appointed a ninemember commission which has been meeting 
for the past month 
the commission will also study the 1900 military installations 
maintained by the united states in foreign nations but will not 
have authority to recommend closures there 
in approving the plan the house rejected a different 
baseclosing proposal which would have retained a few of the 
current restrictions the version approved tuesday was first 
adopted on a 223186 vote shortly before the final passage 
the house action sends the bill to a housesenate conference 
committee to resolve differences with a senatepassed version the 
senate measure was approved as an amendment to a pentagon budget 
bill but was later dropped out of that legislation 
in the decades after world war ii when the nation was winding 
down from its large military structure the pentagon was usually 
allowed to what it wanted on the issue with the exception of a 
handful of bases protected by key members between 1961 and 1977 
the pentagon shut down 3600 installations 
but in 1975 the air force proposed shutting down loring air 
force base in northern maine that states legislators blocked the 
move by requiring lengthy and costly environmental impact 
studies for the loring closure and all future closings 
rep dick armey rtexas chief sponsor of the baseclosing 
plan said the house action will go a long way toward cutting fat 
instead of muscle from our national defense 
armeys plan was rejected a year ago 199192 but he offered 
the proposal again because he argued that a lameduck 
administration might be willing to approve the unpopular cuts 
rep toby roth rwis urged approval of the bill because he 
said its time to cut the pork out of the budget process its 
the right thing for the country 
rep les aucoin dore agreed saying this whole program of 
bases is not a welfare program its not an economic program we 
should have bases for one reason and one reason only because they 
serve military needs 
in working through the bill the house voted down on a voice 
vote a proposed amendment that would have required the closure of 
foreign bases before us bases are shut down 
the chamber also rejected on another voice vote a move that 
would have added four members of congress to the commission

a defendant in a contra armssmuggling indictment 
blasted the charges against him tuesday as a whitewash aimed at 
covering up illegal activities of oliver north and the reagan 
administration 
jack terrell a onetime mercenary who turned against the us 
contra policy and then cooperated with investigators said he was 
informed tuesday he has been charged in a fort lauderdale 
indictment still sealed by the us attorneys office here 
the indictment handed up last month is believed to accuse a 
small number of men with violating the us neutrality act by 
conspiring to aid the contras to overthrow the nicaraguan 
government 
i have some news for this administration terrell said in a 
statement released in washington i wont take the fall for rob 
owen ollie north or ronald reagan 
terrell said the indictments were returned only because congress 
got wind that miamis thenus attorney leon kellner was trying to 
stop the investigation at the behest of attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
congress investigated charges that the probe was sidetracked 
but did not reach any conclusion 
clearly the only reason why the us attorneys office 
sought these indictments is to protect itself said terrell 
kellner couldnt admit that his investigation was a farce and 
that he and his staff had participated in a coverup 
he said he had been cooperating with the us attorney for two 
years giving information about highlevel involvement in the 
illegal supply network but wound up being one of the few indicted 
thats what i call shooting the messenger he said 
kellner has quit the us attorneys office here and will be 
practicing law in washington but he has previously denied charges 
that he stonewalled the investigation and said a congressional 
committee that took testimony from prosecutors in his office failed 
to find evidence that he slowed the investigation at meeses 
request 
terrell who most recently worked for a liberal policy group in 
washington became a vocal opponent of us policy in central 
america north eventually targeted him for his anticontra 
activities according to notes released during the irancontra 
affair 
until he changed his mind on aid to the contras terrell aided 
civilian materiel assistance in its efforts to help the nicaraguan 
rebels 
cmas head tom posey has previously said he expects to be 
indicted along with terrell and has also said he was working to 
aid the reagan administration

weather conditions have been favorable for a 
bumper grain harvest in the soviet union in contrast to damage 
done by heat and drought to us crops a report by the agriculture 
department showed tuesday 
precipitation was above normal in most of the soviet unions 
european area the report said and more than twice the amount of 
normal rain soaked crops in many of the other grain areas 
thus the report said total soviet grain production this year 
continues to be forecast at 215 million metric tons the report 
said that would be the third year in a row that soviet harvests 
have exceeded 200 million tons an unprecedented string of bumper 
yields 
it also would be the third largest soviet grain harvest 
exceeded by the record crop of 2374 million tons in 1978 and the 
1976 harverst of 2238 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 366 bushels 
of wheat or 394 bushels of corn as examples 
despite the bumper harvest the soviet union continues to import 
grain to help rebuild stockpiles and to make more available for an 
expanding livestock sector 
in a related announcement the usda said the soviets have bought 
an additional 350000 tons of us corn for delivery this year 
under a longterm supply agreement between the two countries that 
would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 276 per bushel at the 
farm level meaning that the sale could have a farm value of around 
38 million 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 and there have been negotiations for a 
new one

sen lloyd bentsen jrs selection as the 
democratic vice presidential nominee sent local pride surging in 
his hometown 10 miles from the mexican border where the family 
name stands for wealth and power 
everybody knows the bentsens in south texas just like the du 
ponts or kennedys in new england said justo gonzalez who owns 
a barber shop in downtown mission 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the certain democratic 
presidential nominee announced in boston on tuesday that he had 
designated bentsen as his running mate 
gonzalez and other local boosters said the nomination will bring 
recognition to the lower rio grande valley 
it will put us on the map and as chambers of commerce we are 
always interested in that sort of notoriety said benny 
benavides executive vice president of the mission chamber of 
commerce 
the city of 25000 in hidalgo county was settled by europeans in 
1824 when the roman catholic oblate fathers began occupying an 
area three miles south of the current city its name comes from a 
mission the oblates later built there 
it is the center of the subtropical texas citrus producing area 
and nearly surrounded by grapefruit groves and other farming 
operations 
mobile home and recreational vehicle parks mix dot the 
landscape and retirees from the midwest and canada inflate 
missions population during the winter to more than 50000 
the lower rio grande valley actually a delta of the rio grande 
also has some of the poorest residents of the united states some 
local officials were angered during a campaign swing by jesse 
jackson when the candidate described an unincorporated rural 
subdivision as a little ethiopia 
missions population is about 85 percent mexican american a 
figure that probably would be higher without the real estate 
promotions and business ventures of lloyd bentsen sr 
the elder bentsen at age 94 still oversees about 42000 acres of 
farms and six ranches scattered over south texas an empire he 
started carving out of the brush country in 1920 
my children all grew up learning how to work bentsen sr 
said tuesday 
lloyd jr like his two younger brothers and one sister worked 
mostly in the nurseries and of course spraying the orchards and 
working on the ranches and working cattle the whole thing the 
proud father said 
lloyd dont think hes a conservative he thinks hes a 
moderate bentsen said as geese swam by on the 27acre lake 
behind his familys sprawling ranch house south of mission 
i shouldnt show this to anyone it makes the 
environmentalists mad bentsen said opening the door to a trophy 
room that includes the skins of a tiger polar bears brown bears 
and grizzlies along with a bisons head and other game 
i dont know that much about dukakis what i hear is hes 
probably more liberal in his viewpoints than lloyd is the elder 
bentsen said it will help to balance the ticket

opposition presidential candidate manuel j 
clouthier and about 150 supporters scuffled with presidential 
guards on tuesday in the heart of mexico city then staged a sitin 
to protest alleged electoral fraud 
as president miguel de la madrid arrived at the fine arts palace 
for a speech to about 2500 lawyers clouthier stood up carrying a 
sign that read mr president keep your word the sitin went 
on while de la madrid spoke inside 
results from last wednesdays elections released by the 
governing institutional revolutionary party showed its lowest 
proportion of the vote since its founding 59 years ago the party 
known by its spanish initials pri generally wins the presidency 
with at least 70 percent of the vote 
the figures indicated however that this time the pri will take 
the presidency by only slightly more than 50 percent of the vote 
and will pay little heed to opposition protests of election fraud 
the whitebearded heavyset clouthier a businessman and 
rancher is the candidate of the conservative national action 
party he was running third in unofficial partial returns from 
last wednesdays elections 
clouthier and the other top opposition candidate cuauhtemoc 
cardenas of the leftist national democratic front claim the 
government is rigging the vote count in favor of the pris carlos 
salinas de gortari 
de la madrid had pledged clean elections government and party 
officials are calling the vote the cleanest ever in mexico 
clouthier vowed to lead sitins at every event where de la 
madrid or salinas is scheduled to appear as part of a national 
civil disobedience campaign to protest the alleged fraud he said 
earlier he would file criminal charges against the head of the 
national electoral registry 
carrying signs reading punishment for electoral criminals 
and total repudiation of the electoral fraud the group pushed 
past a line of about 50 plainclothes presidential guards who tried 
to stop them 
after a scuffle the group sat down at the entrance to the 
ornate landmark building in downtown mexico city 
the federal election commission the only source of official 
results adjourned early tuesday and said it would not meet again 
until wednesday night seven days after the elections it was 
releasing official results only on balloting for the chamber of 
deputies the lower house of congress 
with the vote count lagging the pri again released data it said 
came from the federal commission 
those results showed salinas de gortari had 5359 percent of the 
votes counted cardenas was second with 2608 percent and clouthier 
had 1604 percent 
two candidates for small parties and null ballots accounted for 
the remainder 
those results showed a turnout of 517 percent in the 235 of the 
300 districts tallied the government newspaper el nacional said 
but original reports claimed an exceptionally high turnout 
earlier the government and the governing party had blamed the high 
turnout for the slowness of the vote count 
turnout was officially placed at 75 percent in the last 
presidential race in 1982 but strong candidates and active 
campaigns on the left and right spurred voter interest in the july 
6 race 
cardenas charged on monday that the election officials were not 
counting many of the votes that had been cast for opposition 
candidates cardenas claims he won based on figures he says came 
from unidentified pri officials 
cardenas a former pri senator and michoacan state governor led 
a dissident movement within the governing party before breaking 
away last year to accept the candidacy of other parties 
ballots are counted at polling places immediately after the 
election but according to law those for the chamber of deputies 
and for the senate must be processed before those for president in 
an official count 
the only returns released officially by the commission so far 
gave 241 of the 500 seats in the chamber to the pri 32 to the 
national action party and 10 to parties that support cardenas the 
results were from 283 of the 300 electoral districts 
victories by parties supporting cardenas were in the state of 
mexico which surrounds mexico city and michoacan victories for 
the national action party were in the western state of jalisco the 
federal district which is the core of the mexico city metropolitan 
area and the northern border state of chihuahua 
the governing party has not lost a presidential senate or 
gubernatorial race since it was founded in 1929

a military tribunal is fighting the pentagons 
attempt to investigate an anonymous allegation that bribery 
influenced its decision overturning a navy heart surgeons 
convictions for the deaths of three patients 
the navymarine corps court of military review obtained an order 
from the court of military appeals temporarily barring the defense 
departments inspector general from proceeding with the 
investigation 
the military appeals court which originally granted the 
temporary injunction june 30 extended the order monday for 15 days 
pending its final decision in the matter 
at issue says patrick j carome a lawyer appointed to 
represent the tribunal is the independence of military courts from 
interference by the pentagons command hierarchy 
the judges feel this is a situation in which command influence 
or at least the appearance of it is being brought to bear on the 
tribunals unpopular decision to set aside the negligent homicide 
and involuntary manslaughter convictions of cmdr donal m billig 
carome said 
on april 13 the navymarine corps tribunal overturned billigs 
conviction and accused navy prosecutors of waging a smear 
campaign against the surgeon who had practiced at the bethesda 
naval hospital outside washington 
at a hearing monday lt cmdr lawrence w muschamp told the 
military appeals court that billigs conviction could not be 
revived even if the bribery allegations were proven 
but june gibbs brown the pentagons inspector general told the 
military review tribunal june 23 that the investigation could 
affect its billig ruling if the decision was procured by bribery 
or fraud according to court papers 
brown told the court there is no indication of any criminal 
misconduct by the judges or the court staff according to a 
summary of her remarks to the judges 
the allegation received from an anonymous tipster who called 
the inspector generals hotline may 2 has not been detailed by 
pentagon authorities the tipster has been interviewed several 
times but pentagon authorities have not identified the person 
according to court papers 
at mondays hearing muschamp said the investigation would 
involve only whether there was an improper outside attempt to 
influence the court investigators would be careful not to intrude 
in the decisionmaking process of the court 
but carome argued that a special judicial commission not the 
pentagon inspector general should conduct any investigation to 
preserve the independence of the military court 
allowing the inspector general mechanism to kick into high 
gear and focus in on a court in a particular decision in a 
particular case based on a simple anonymous tip and nothing more 
really sets up a situation in which disgruntled parties after a 
case can utilize this mechanism to harass and interfere with the 
judicial process carome said in a telephone interview 
there are a lot of people at the navy and the pentagon who are 
unhappy with the result in the billig case he said

the government postponed the 
executions of the sharpeville six indefinitely tuesday and prime 
minister margaret thatcher of britain promised a new plea for 
clemency by world leaders 
justice minister kobie coetsee said the executions by hanging of 
the six blacks were delayed so the appellate court south africas 
highest tribunal can respond to their appeals 
the last stay of execution for the five men and one woman was 
until july 19 they were convicted in the mob killing of a town 
council member in the sharpeville black township and originally 
were scheduled to die in march the six had originally been 
sentenced to hang in march 
their convictions were based on the principle of common 
purpose they were part of a crowd that stoned and burned town 
councilor kuzwayo dlamini to death in september 1984 
intense controversy surrounds the death sentences because the 
six were cleared of directly causing victims death and because 
violence against a town councilor who cooperated with south 
africas apartheid policy of racial segregation is considered by 
many to be a political crime 
many foreign leaders have asked president pw botha to grant 
clemency to the six francis mokgesi 31 reid mokoena 24 oupa 
moses diniso 32 theresa ramashamola 27 duma joshua khumalo 28 
and reginald sefatsa 32 
botha refused to intervene in march supreme court judge willem 
human of transvaal province who had sentenced them granted a 
temporary stay hours before the time of execution at pretoria 
central prison 
defense attorneys said the trial should be reopened because some 
witnesses had said police forced them to give false testimony 
one prosecution witness steve manete wrote to botha last week 
that he was assaulted and threatened by police to falsely identify 
two of the accused as being at the scene of dlaminis death he 
said other state witnesses also were unhappy with their 
testimony against the sharpeville six and begged botha to stop 
the executions 
judge human decided june 13 not to reopen the case because he 
said the court had not relied solely on the suspect witnesses 
testimony he added that allegations of police influence on other 
prosecution witnesses were absurd 
he gave the defendants until july 19 to challenge the death 
sentences in the appellate court which had upheld his decision not 
to reopen the trial 
some south african commentators have suggested the intense 
international campaign on behalf of the defendants makes it more 
difficult for botha to grant clemency because he may appear to be 
giving in to foreign pressure 
joyce mokgesi whose brother francis is one of those condemned 
met with mrs thatcher on tuesday she promised that to make 
another appeal for clemency if the high court upholds the death 
sentences 
mrs thatcher said leaders of the european economic community 
and the worlds seven major industrialized nations would join the 
appeal 
the defendants were convicted under laws passed by the south 
african parliament which has no black representation and 
sentenced by a judicial system that excludes black judges 
botha added to the controversy by saying last march he could not 
grant clemency because he did not want to interfere in the judicial 
process a few days later however he stopped the trial of six 
south african soldiers accused of causing the death of a black 
activist in southwest africa a territory controlled by south 
africa 
in june justice minister coetsee told parliament the president 
had commuted 115 death sentences between 1983 and the end of 1987

it was nearly midnight when michael dukakis asked 
the four advisers at his kitchen table for recommendations on the 
potential running mates they had been discussing the unanimous 
verdict sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
thats my choice said dukakis 
with that the selection process that began june 8 ended 
dukakis would ask the democratic national convention to nominate 
bentsen as his running mate in the effort to capture the white 
house in november 
a key figure at the table was paul brountas the boston lawyer 
and former harvard law school classmate who headed dukakis search 
after bentsens name was announced on tuesday brountas described 
what had happened 
the decision made it was decided to notify the texas senator 
immediately 
we put a call in and there was no answer said brountas 
we put a second call in around quarter to twelve and there was no 
answer 
what they didnt know was that bentsen was home but had turned 
off his telephone because he had been getting so many late night 
calls from reporters chasing the vice presidential selection story 
at 630 on tuesday morning bentsen was shaving when the 
telephone rang it was dukakis offering him the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket 
despite bentsens professed indifference to such an offer 
brountas said that when he met with the senator in midjune bentsen 
indicated to me he would accept if asked 
the dukakis adviser said that when he arrived at dukakis 
brookline home monday night the decision was still open and that he 
did not mislead jesse jackson when he told him jackson still was 
under consideration 
asked at a washington news conference if he was angry jackson 
replied no im too controlled im too clear im too mature to 
be angry im focused on what we must do to keep hope alive 
in boston the night before seated around the dukakis kitchen 
table along with dukakis and brountas were kitty dukakis the 
governors wife susan estrich his campaign manager and jack 
corrigan the deputy campaign manager 
during the primary season dukakis kept insisting he would not 
begin thinking about a running mate until after he had clinched the 
nomination 
that was true said brountas who said he tried to raise the 
matter with dukakis the night of june 7 the last night of the 
primary season and was told to wait until breakfast the next 
morning 
brountas presented dukakis with a long memo outlining the 
various considerations and then began the weeks of information 
gathering 
he said he gained the confidence of the 200 or so people he 
consulted by describing himself as a committee of one who would 
pass information only to dukakis 
he assembled a team of lawyers and tax accountants to 
investigate the individuals who were the finalists for 
consideration 
brountas refused to discuss the reasons any of the others were 
not chosen over bentsen except to say no one was eliminated from 
consideration as a result of the background checks 
the day of the decision brountas flew to washington to meet 
with jackson 
his return flight was canceled by a thunderstorm but he managed 
to catch a later flight and arrived at dukakis home between 1030 
pm and 11 pm 
meanwhile dukakis looking unflappable mowed his lawn in the 
dark as he waited for his close friend and adviser to appear 
as he methodically crisscrossed the yard with his push mower 
night the massachusetts governor gave no hint how close he was to 
ending the growing speculation over his choice for a running mate 
but there were other signs that a decision was near 
newsmen clustered in front of the house on perry street saw 
estrich and corrigan join dukakis inside the house 
meanwhile democrats were arriving in atlanta to nominate 
dukakis for president and the big topic of conversation was 
speculation about his choice for a running mate 
the name getting the most mention was that of sen john glenn of 
ohio the former astronaut who became a national hero when he was 
the first american to orbit earth 
but the people who mattered the most werent in atlanta they 
were in dukakis home in brookline 
it was tight circle of five the governor his most trusted 
adviser brountas his two campaign aides and his wife kitty 
it had not been an easy day for brountas the boston lawyer who 
headed the vice presidential talent hunt 
his principal order of business in washington was a meeting with 
jesse jackson and according to one participant brountas assured 
jackson he was under serious consideration 
as soon as their meeting ended jackson told reporters that if 
offered the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket i would accept 
it 
but despite brountas assurances to the former civil rights 
leader one of the safest bets about the process was that jackson 
would not get that offer 
in addition to bentsen glenn and jackson the names on dukakis 
list were sens albert gore jr of tennessee and bob graham of 
florida and reps richard gephardt of missouri and lee hamilton of 
indiana 
sen sam nunn of georgia remained a subject of speculation 
despite his insistence he wasnt interested in the job 
each of the prospects had a moment or two in the sun when rumors 
flared that they were gaining favor 
but each time dukakis was asked about the latest rumors he 
brushed them aside saying that only he and brountas were qualified 
to speak authoritatively and they werent talking

the united states and iran agreed to delay 
a security council meeting on the downed iranian airliner largely 
on irans initiative because it could not muster a majority for 
condemnation diplomats said tuesday 
a majority vote in the 15nation council would force the united 
states to use its veto to stop a resolution of condemnation the 
meeting originally scheduled for tuesday has been postponed until 
thursday morning 
us ambassador vernon a walters told reporters he did not 
believe iran had the votes to condemn the united states for 
shooting down the airliner july 3 in the persian gulf all 290 
people aboard were killed 
walters spoke after meeting with secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar who later conferred with foreign minister aliakbar 
velayati of iran velayati left the building without speaking to 
reporters 
i dont think it a resolution of condemnation was a matter 
of serious consideration because i dont think they can get the 
votes for it walters said in answer to a question 
everyone knows perfectly well this was not a premedidated act 
everybody knows the us is investigating everybody knows the 
united states is a completely transparent country in which the 
findings of our investigation will become known in a very short 
time 
perez de cuellar spent more than an hour each with walters and 
velayati prompting speculation about an attempt to bring the sides 
together 
the council meeting was postponed monday night by ambassador 
paulo nogueirabatista of brazil the president for july after 
consultations with the united states iran and other members 
it is expected to hear speakers thursday but the agenda is not 
known

needed for consultations and preparations 
officials also cited the international civil aviation 
organization meeting wednesday in montreal on the shooting down of 
the airliner by the cruiser uss vincennes fired a missile at the 
civilian aircraft the united states says the crew mistook the iran 
air airbus for an iranian f14 fighter 
diplomatic sources said privately both the united states and 
iran want to avoid a showdown in the council they said plans for a 
resolution apparently have been scrapped and delegates were working 
on a milder letter from the council president that would be 
approved by concensus 
iran had said it wants the council to condemn the us military 
action demand withdrawal of all us forces from the persian gulf 
and call for reparations 
the sources said the united states effectively preempted iran in 
the security council by offering compensation to families of the 
victims and by expressing deep regret 
any resolution condemning the united states was expected to be 
vetoed by the united states britain and france the other two 
permanent members of the council who also have veto power are the 
soviet union and china 
current nonpermanent members of the council are algeria 
argentina brazil italy japan nepal senegal west germany

the soviet foreign ministry on tuesday told the 
us ambassador and a pakistani envoy that pakistans harboring of 
a rival afghan government violates the international agreement on 
afghanistan 
afghan rebel groups based in pakistan announced last month the 
creation of a government and demanded the ouster of president 
najib the prosoviet afghan leader 
first deputy foreign ministry yuli m vorontsov called us 
ambassador us ambassador jack matlock and pakistani charge 
daffairs samuel t joshua to his offices for separate meetings 
ministry spokesman vadim perfilyev said it was not a threat of 
possible soviet military retaliation perfilyev added 
it was the latest in a series of statements by the soviets 
denouncing pakistan where most of the moslem guerrillas fighting 
afghanistans marxist government have bases 
perfilyev said at a news briefing that the ministrys statement 
is made for the sole purpose of showing to the government of 
pakistan and to public opinion the vital need to implement the 
agreements 
the unmediated afghan agreement signed april 14 in geneva 
commits the soviet union to begin withdrawing its more than 100000 
military personnel from afghanistan the soviet withdrawal began 
may 15 and is to be completed within 10 months 
the accords also commit pakistan and afghanistan not to 
interfere in each others affairs the united states and the soviet 
union are listed as guarantors of the agreement the moslem rebels 
did not sign the pact 
in afghanistan reports said there was fighting around three 
provincial cities 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
government battle the rebels who have received support from 
pakistan and the united states 
perfilyev said vorontsov told joshua that the creation of a 
transitional afghan government on pakistani soil is a violation of 
the geneva agreement he reported vorontsov as saying the 
consequences of the violations will be borne by the pakistani side 
totally 
perfilyev added imagine the situation where somebody tried to 
form an american government outside the territory of the united 
states for example in canada 
mohammed anwar an employee at the pakistani mission said 
joshua had been called to the foreign ministry by vorontsov but 
anwar said he could not disclose what happened at the meeting 
vorontsov also delivered a verbal note to matlock in a 
separate meeting complaining of the new destructive action by 
pakistan perfilyev said 
us embassy spokeswoman marguerite squire said the meeting had 
occurred but the embassy did not comment on diplomatic discussions 
perfilyev said vorontsov told matlock that pakistani actions 
violate the afghan accords and the kremlin hoped washington would 
do everything in its power to influence pakistan to end its 
interference in afghan affairs and abide by its geneva 
obligations 
in an interview published sunday the soviet commander in 
afghanistan said the withdrawal timetable for his troops could be 
affected 
we are prepared to continue to implement strictly and 
faithfully the provisions of the geneva agreements lt gen 
boris gromov told the krasnaya zvezda newspaper 
although i do not rule out that unceasing violations of the 
provisions by pakistan may lead to a situation when appropriate 
conclusions will be made as regards the timetable of the troop 
withdrawal he was quoted as saying 
in islamabad pakistan western diplomatic sources said fighting 
continued for control of provincial and district capitals but the 
guerrillas were not occupying the cities because of retaliatory 
bombings and shelling by soviet and afghan groops 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of one of the afghan resistance 
parties with headquarters in pakistan said we can keep the 
cities but at the price of heavy casualties 
rebel leaders reported their forces seized and then withdrew 
from the capitals of zabul and wardak provinces afghanistans 
second largest city of kandahar 310 miles southwest of the capital 
of kabul has been under siege for two months and western diplomats 
said the government is warning residents against cooperating with 
the guerrillas

the senate governmental affairs committee 
approved legislation tuesday that would change the oftcriticized 
federal budget process by putting it into a twoyear cycle 
the measure would appear to have lttle chance of being enacted 
this year the proposal is a controversial one and congress has a 
short schedule this year because of the presidential and 
congressional elections 
under the bill which was approved by a 90 vote the budget 
resolution that charts the governments finances and the spending 
and tax bills that flesh out those plans would cover two years 
currently those measures cover only one year 
congress would spend the second year of the new budget process 
reviewing spending decisions 
sen wendell ford dky the measures sponsor and his 
supporters have argued that with the present singleyear process 
congress spends too much time bogged down on budget matters and not 
enough time scrutinizing its fiscal decisions 
it is not too much to ask that congress and the executive 
branch take one year in each congress to ensure that abuse is 
caught and dealt with before it becomes a public scandal ford 
said in a written statement 
proponents also say that with congress consistently passing 
spending bills late well into the fiscal year for much of the 
1980s federal agencies must operate in a state of confusion over 
what their budgets will be this makes planning for the agencies 
difficult 
such legislation has been introduced in the past it 
consistently runs into opposition from lawmakers who argue that 
twoyear budgeting would be too inflexible making it hard to 
adjust to sudden emergencies or changes in the economys 
performance 
members of the budget and appropriations committees can be 
expected to jealously guard their legislative turf against a bill 
that would diminish their authority the legislation now must be 
considered by the budget panel 
in addition democrats may want to wait to see how massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis should he become president would feel about 
such an alteration to the budget process

a federal report was optimistic when it projected the 1988 corn 
crop would shrink by 204 billion bushels over last year and 
soybeans would produce 250 million fewer bushels state and private 
crop forecasters said tuesday 
one private forecaster called the us department of agriculture 
report unrealistic and others said it was too soon to accurately 
measure damage to crops from the prolonged drought gripping the 
farm belt 
the report released tuesday said the corn crop may be off 1987s 
production of 706 billion bushels by 26 percent at 52 billion 
bushels and the soybean crop may drop from 1987s 19 billion 
bushels to 165 billion bushels 
experts in iowa and illinois the nations top two 
cornproducing states stood by predictions their states could lose 
half their corn to the extreme heat and drought 
we could lose 50 percent and possibly more if we get an 
extended period of high temperatures low humidity and wind said 
neal harl an iowa state university economist 
larry werries director of illinois department of agriculture 
said the federal projections are way too high if state 
officials are correct 
maybe well raise that much corn nationwide but illinois 
wont contribute very much werries said were worse off in 
illinois than they anticipate 
were not any better than 60 bushels per acre which is half 
of our average for the last five years 
werries said the federal soybean projections may be closer to 
the truth because the bean crop is not at as critical a stage as 
the corn 
they may be a little on the high side but with beans its 
harder to tell said werries theres still some potential for 
soybeans we may be able to get threefourths our normal crop in 
illinois 
in the deep south which also has been ravaged by drought and 
heat georgia agriculture commissioner tommy irvin said the usda 
projections represented a substantial reduction and were not 
unexpected 
the early corn has been absolutely devastated irvin said of 
georgias crops there are still prospects for soybeans to make 
a good recovery 
bud frazier vice president for balfour maclaine inc a 
commodities trading company disagreed with the governments 
predictions on corn 
in all probability the corn crop will be lower and the 
carryover surplus predicted by the government to be 4 billion 
bushels will be lower the corn figures i think were going to 
view with some skepticism frazier said 
were not supposed to do that with government reports but i 
dont think we can help it he added 
the usda also predicted consumer food prices would be 3 percent 
to 5 percent higher because of the drought but dan basse crop 
analyst for gnp commodities inc said those figures were too low 
i think theyre being too modest in their estimates of the 
inflationary impact of the drought basse said 
illinois and iowa also rank oneandtwo in soybean production in 
the united states 
the more modest reduction in soybeans is in line with 
expectations that soybeans provide a much greater opportunity for 
recovery said harl 
minnesota indiana and ohio officials said the national 
projections didnt accurately reflect the situation in their states 
id say well have about a 60 percent corn crop an 80 percent 
soybean crop and maybe a 40 percent wheat crop said jim nichols 
minnesota state agriculture commissioner 
dave mengel purdue university agronomist estimated indianas 
corn crop loss at 30 percent 
kirby hidy spokesman for the ohio farm bureau federation 
called the federal report a little optimistic 
we would expect corn production in ohio to be reduced by as 
much as 50 percent hidy said the projections of a 13 percent 
soybean drop are probably accurate for ohio he said

us ambassador richard melton cited 
abraham lincoln on tyranny as he left nicaragua tuesday expelled 
by the government with seven other american diplomats on charges of 
fomenting domestic dissent 
lincoln taught us that tyranny never has moral 
justification melton read from a prepared statement before 
departing in a drizzle on a us air force c12 turbo 
it is my wish and that of my government that nicaraguans 
working together will find solutions to their problems which allow 
them to fulfill their destiny living in peace as a free and 
prosperous people in a democratic nation he said 
the us embassy said earlier that the expulsions were 
outrageous and completely without justification 
the embassy said melton would travel to san salvador or 
honduras then take a commercial flight for the united states the 
embassy also said melton traveled alone not with five us 
diplomats as the staterun voice of nicaragua had reported and 
that the seven others will leave thursday 
the leftist sandinista government on monday expelled the eight 
diplomats and told them they had 72 hours to leave the country it 
accused them of criminal acts against the nicaraguan people 
according to the government the eight were fomenting dissent 
and helped organize a large antigovernment demonstration last 
sunday that ended in violence 
some us embassy personnel attended the rally but the embassy 
said it was normal for its diplomats to maintain contact with 
nicaraguans 
also monday the government closed the roman catholic churchs 
radio station radio catolica and shut down for 15 days the only 
opposition newspaper la prensa the actions marked a sharp setback 
in democratic reforms made in recent months to comply with a 
regional peace plan 
in announcing meltons departure the voice of nicaragua said 
sarcastically that many people of the nicaraguan right and the 
director of la prensa violeta chamorro are crying at this time 
because of the departure of their ambassador 
in washington president reagan retaliated by ordering 
nicaraguas ambassador and seven other diplomats out of the united 
states 
the nicaraguan government identified the other expelled 
americans as david nolan john creamer hugh simon jr aubrey 
carlson delvin junker john hope and robert murray 
we are disposed to accept a new ambassador less addicted to 
the psychopathic orientations of assistant secretary of state for 
latin america elliot abrams foreign minister miguel descoto 
said monday 
president daniel ortega said the decision was made so the united 
states would learn to respect this country and its people he 
added nicaragua was prepared to confront any type of american 
escalation as a result 
a us embassy statement said the ousters follow a series of 
repressive actions directed against the political opposition labor 
and press in nicaragua 
an interior ministry statement charged la prensa with violating 
internal security and national defense it said the newspaper 
incited violence and subverted public order 
the headline of mondays la prensa was sandinista police club 
the people reporting on sundays demonstration it carried 
another article headlined accounts of a brutal attack by the 
police 
the sandinistas also claim la prensa is the voice of the 
cia the paper receives us funding through the national 
endowment for democracy 
radio catolicas programming included cardinal miguel obando y 
bravos homily in which he defended the right of the people to 
civic protest 
grumblings against us embassy involvement in internal 
nicaraguan affairs began last week sandinista officials said they 
had discovered a plan melton that sought to create an internal 
front of dissident 
the sandinistas said part of the us plan to destabilize the 
government was put into effect sunday in nandaime a town 40 miles 
south of the capital fighting broke out between security forces 
and some of the estimated 10000 demonstrators 
sandinista newspapers ran a picture of murray one of the us 
diplomats expelled at the protest with his fist raised 
us embassy spokesman jan hartman said the picture was taken as 
murray was summoning a group of americans back to the cars to leave 
the embassy statement said us diplomats maintain contact 
with as wide a spectrum of nicaraguan citizens as possible and 
noted that such activities are the normal duties of us embassy 
officials overseas 
the sandinistas also have accused the united states of 
responsibility for recent rebel attacks that violate the march 21 
ceasefire the government and the rebels known as contras have 
been at war for almost seven years they signed the agreement to 
seek a negotiated settlement to the war but the talks are at an 
impasse 
the reagan administration has backed and trained the rebels 
since 1981 
the government had pushed ahead with a regional peace plan 
outline signed last august by the presidents of nicaragua el 
salvador guatemala costa rica and honduras it called for 
democratic liberties ceasefires and an end to supporting 
insurgencies in nicaragua guatemala and el salvador 
as part of its compliance the government had allowed the 
reopening of radio catolica and la prensa and permitted opposition 
demonstrations including the one last week

the soviet union on tuesday launched its second 
spacecraft in a week toward mars in an ambitious program to unlock 
mysteries of the red planet and its largest moon phobos 
orange flames flared in the night sky over soviet central asia 
as a proton booster rocket sent the unmanned phobos ii vehicle on a 
111 millionmile voyage to mars arrival is expected in january 
soviet television showed a recording during its evening news 
broadcast of the launch of phobos ii at 901 pm moscow time 101 
pm edt from a pad at the baikonur cosmodrome on the steppes of 
central asia 
phobos i was launched last thursday and the media said its 
onboard navigation systems were activated the next day 
television showed flags of more than dozen nations including 
the united states flying at baikonur the countries are 
participating in the mission that is designed to send the two space 
probes close to the phobos moon and drop instruments onto the 
surface scientists said the mission might provide clues to how the 
universe was formed 
they have said that if phobos is an asteroid trapped by mars 
gravity as many scientists believe the probes will be able to 
study matter that is little changed since the infancy of the solar 
system billions of years ago 
the two soviet spacecraft are to enter the gravitational pull of 
mars in january and fall into orbit just behind phobos for a 
threemonth study of the martian surface atmosphere and magnetic 
field 
in april the two craft will drop out of their orbit and swoop 
to within 100 feet of phobos surface and release two 100pound 
landers 
in one experiment a laser beam carried by a lander is designed 
to split off a tiny piece of phobos rocky surface and trap it for 
close examination 
one of the landers is expected to operate for about a year in a 
stationary position sending back data the other is planned to 
bound like a superkangaroo about phobos in 65foot leaps gathering 
and analyzing soil samples 
soviet scientists have said the phobos mission is an important 
step toward a manned flight to mars which they believe may be 
possible early in the 21st century 
officials have placed the cost of the phobos mission at 480 
million 
in the united states nasas deep space network will provide 
radiotracking data to help the spacecraft locate phobos which is 
only about 17 miles in diameter

a coast guard officer testified tuesday that the 
seized cargo ship encounter bay was loaded with 72 tons of 
marijuana off danang vietnam in early june and that the 
vietnamese army was involved in the operation 
lt thomas rogers the law enforcement officer on the coast 
guard cutter boutwell made the disclosure at a detention hearing 
for the 18 crewmen of the encounter bay 
the coast guard knew there was approximately 143000 pounds of 
highgrade thai marijuana loaded off danang vietnam sometime 
during the first 10 days of june rogers said 
asked by defense attorney peter mair what else he knew about the 
loading rogers said the only additional information i can 
recall is that the vietnamese army was involved 
rogers disclosed the vietnamese connection just before the 
hearing was suspended for the day us assistant attorney jerry 
diskin declined to comment on the disclosure after the hearing 
i was shocked at the revelation said mair attorney for 
anthony gilbert sayers 53 of new zealand one of the crew 
the panamanianregistered ship was seized 500 miles off the 
washington coast on june 30 in what the coast guard said was the 
largest maritime bust ever on the west coast 
the crew three americans one from england one from new 
zealand and 13 from indonesia thailand and singapore have been 
charged with intent to distribute marijuana 
defense lawyers have argued that the us government cant prove 
that the crew knew what the cargo was and that there wasnt 
probable cause to stop the ship 
the encounter bay carried documents showing it had left 
singapore on june 5 or 6 but rogers said he didnt know whether 
that was the vessels last port of call 
rogers said he didnt know whether the crew got on board before 
or after the vessel received its cargo or whether documentation 
found on board would answer the question 
he also testified that he believed the crew members were read 
their miranda rights but that he didnt know whether the rights 
probably read in english were understood by the crewmen from 
southeast asia 
us magistrate john weinberg would not allow questions about 
the encounter bays destination saying it was irrelevant to the 
hearing which was only to determine whether there was enough 
evidence to schedule a trial 
attorney john muenster representing terrance albert nolan 36 
of the united states said the question of destination was relevant 
because the charges against the crew require the government to 
prove that the ship either had left or was approaching a us port 
or was in us customs territory a term that neither he nor 
rogers could define 
on monday howard weitzman a los angeles attorney representing 
crew member samuel j colflesh 31 of philadelphia said the ship 
was in international waters when seized 
a number of constitutional issues are at stake including 
the right to go out and pirate a boat he said 
also monday muenster questioned whether intelligence collected 
on the encounter bay had been acquired through wiretapping 
we surmise there was wiretapping and if the seizure of the 
boat is based on wiretaps that were illegal then the evidence 
could not be introduced in federal court muenster said

the last of three inmates whisked by 
helicopter from the state prison in a daring escape was back in 
custody tuesday and so was the pilot of the chopper who flew the 
same aircraft in the movie rambo iii 
convicted murderer daniel mahoney 30 was captured in central 
new mexico tuesday morning after a massive search in woods 
the pilot of the helicopter charles bella originally had told 
authorities a woman hijacked him in el paso texas and forced him 
to fly to the prison south of santa fe 
santa fe county district attorney chet walter said bella 43 
and beverly shoemaker were charged tuesday with three counts of 
assisting escape and one count of conspiracy to commit escape 
the two appeared later tuesday before magistrate isaac 
archuleta who set 100000 cash bond for each bella pleaded 
innocent and the judge automatically entered an innocent plea for 
shoemaker who was not represented by an attorney walter also 
filed complaints against the other two inmates who climbed aboard 
the helicopter monday morning charging each with one count of 
escape and one count of conspiracy 
bella was the pilot of the aerospatiale gazelle that swooped 
into the prison yard picked up the convicts and fled under a 
fusillade of gunfire from guards in towers 
bella shoemaker and the three inmates all were arrested within 
16 hours of the escape 
carrol bella said her husband who runs a charter flight 
business catering mostly to television news crews and real estate 
salespeople told her and police he was hijacked at gunpoint by a 
woman who had chartered the helicopter she said her husband told 
her the woman handcuffed his hand to the helicopters controls and 
forced him to pick up the three inmates 
a close friend of bella tony mobley told the associated press 
in el paso texas that the pilot flew stunts in the movies rambo 
iii and extreme prejudice in rambo iii the gazelle 
modified to look like a soviet hind helicopter is shot down by the 
character played by sylvester stallone 
its a tough case walter said adding there was probable 
cause to believe bella was involved in an escape plot 
when the chopper was finally forced down at albuquerque 
international airport after a 20mile aerial chase bella was 
taken into custody while his story was checked out 
bella and ms shoemaker 41 were being held at the santa fe 
county detention center the inmates were returned to the state 
prison 
moments after the helicopter left the prison monday a us 
customs service helicopter began pursuit 
the fugitive helicopter landed briefly at a central new mexico 
airport about an hour after the escape where mahoney shoemaker 
and randy mack lackey jumped out lackey and the woman fled in 
different directions said department of public safety spokesman 
dan taylor 
police officers at the airport confronted lackey as he tried to 
get away in a stolen pickup truck but officers shot him in the 
shoulder and he was arrested said taylor ms shoemaker who was 
described by taylor as mahoneys girlfriend was arrested later at 
the airport 
the helicopter meanwhile was involved in an upanddown 
weaving chase through the skies over albuquerque from los lunas 
south of the city to a small commuter airfield north of the city 
and back south to the international airport 
after some aerial jousting with the customs service helicopter 
and a state police chopper flown by maj john denko bella landed 
at the albuquerque airport he was arrested there along with the 
third prisoner francis preston mitchell less than two hours after 
the escape 
mahoney was serving a life sentence plus 60 years from 
hillsborough county fla for seconddegree murder and armed 
robbery mitchell was serving a life sentence from summit county 
utah for firstdegree murder and lackey was serving a nineyear 
sentence for larceny from curry county nm 
mitchell and mahoney were being held in new mexico under an 
interstate compact that allows states to swap prisoners

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev urged a 
rally of polish and soviet youth on tuesday to return to the 
lessons of lenin and to join in gorbachevs reform movement 
opposition activists claimed riot police attacked and arrested 
steel workers in the southeastern town of stalowa wola they said 
the workers had threatened to strike during gorbachevs visit a 
government spokesman confirmed a police incident but said there 
were no major disturbances 
speaking at krakows wawel castle the residence of polish kings 
and queens until the late 1500s gorbachev repeatedly emphasized 
that lenin the founder of the soviet union could serve as a model 
in the era of the second world revolution since the birth of 
socialism 
lenins life and struggle constitute a splendid example to be 
followed by young people a lesson in pursuing ones goals and 
being faithful to the ideal born out of love for people he said 
the speech was a vigorous defense of communist ideology in a 
country where fewer than 1 percent of people under the age of 35 
have joined the party and where young people tend to long for the 
material success of western nations 
asking rhetorically has socialism fallen through gorbachev 
answered no not at all 
we have transformed backward russia from top to bottom and 
made a great power of it and all that thanks to socialism that 
would have been impossible on a different road 
the rally came on the second day of gorbachevs sixday trip to 
poland 
the soviet leader and his wife raisa who arrived in warsaw on 
monday flew to krakow on tuesday to tour the city where pope john 
paul ii served as archbishop before he was named pope in 1979 
gorbachev visited a mountain home near krakow where lenin lived 
in 1913 and 1914 while plotting the revolution that brought the 
bolsheviks to power in russia in 1917 gorbachev often cites 
lenins pragmatic approach to economic reform as a precedent for 
his own policies that encourage greater openness and 
marketoriented reforms 
in a day of sightseeing he also went to the house where his 
father a red army soldier was hospitalized during world war ii 
visited one of the nations most historic churches st marys and 
chatted with the people who were allowed onto krakows old market 
square 
gorbachevs 20minute sojourn in the 14th century roman catholic 
church on the square was the first time in memory a head of the 
officially atheist soviet communist party went into a working 
church 
it reflected the lessening of the gulf between the party and 
religion in april gorbachev received the head of the russian 
orthodox church at the kremlin the first such meeting in at least 
40 years and has promised a new law on relations between church and 
state some churches have been reopened and confiscated church 
property returned 
monsignor jan kosciolek of st marys said we went through 
the main gate and we walked to the main altar we talked about the 
architecture and emphasized that it was the biggest altar north of 
the alps 
kosciolek said gorbachev signed the guest book reporters were 
not allowed in the church during the visit 
activists with the banned solidarity trade union movement said 
police surrounded a church tuesday where some workers took refuge 
after the alleged attack monday night in stalowa wola 
they said an undetermined number of people were detained by 
police and about 50 people had taken refuge in the church 
a government spokesman ryszard strauss confirmed a 
conflictprone situation at the church but denied any 
organized police attack he said at least one person was detained 
and he could not rule out that some officers used clubs 
the workers had threatened to strike during the gorbachev visit 
unless seven colleagues fired for leading a twoday strike in april 
were reinstated 
on monday gorbachev told the polish parliament or sejm that 
he is moving to set the record straight about josef stalins rule 
including supporting a drive to erect a monument in moscow to 
stalins victims 
but he indicated he is not yet prepared to accept soviet 
responsibility for the massacre of about 4300 polish military 
officers in the katyn forest near the russian city of smolensk 
shortly after the outbreak of world war ii 
the katyn massacre remains a festering sore in relations between 
the communist neighbors 
the soviet union has never admitted responsibility for the 
slaughter each officer was bound killed with a single bullet 
through the head and left to rot in a mass grave the murdered 
officers had been interned by the soviets who accused the nazis of 
the massacre 
a joint study commission has been established to investigate 
katyn but gorbachev indicated monday that he is not yet prepared 
to draw any concuslions

housing minister david levy inaugurated a new 
jewish settlement in the west bank on tuesday and vowed others will 
be built there despite the 7monthold palestinian uprising against 
israeli occupation 
we hear the voices of the uprising levy a leader of the 
rightwing likud bloc told israel television but we are the 
ones who make the facts and those are another settlement another 
highway another house another family 
these developments also occurred 
in nablus the west banks largest city army bullets hit two 
palestinians in the legs during a demonstration protesting the 
death of 17yearold sares anabtawi who was killed by army gunfire 
monday 
at a courthouse in arab east jerusalem officials said about 30 
palestinians attacked police officers taking a handcuffed arab 
detainee to his cell the officials said six officers were injured 
and four people arrested 
palestinian witnesses said armed jewish settlers beat four arabs 
and smashed the windows of two vehicles in the west bank village of 
ein arik apparently in retaliation for the stoning of an israeli 
bus 
the new jewish settlement of shima near hebron is designed to 
house 250 families the first 15 families were to arrive wednesday 
and live in mobile homes until permanent housing is built 
it is the first settlement to be established since the uprising 
began in december in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
according to un figures 220 palestinians and four israelis have 
been killed in the insurrection in the territories captured by 
israel in the 1967 middle east war 
shima will be the sixth west bank settlement to be built since 
1984 under a coalition agreement reached in 1984 between likud and 
the leftleaning labor party which opposes a largescale 
settlement program the number of new settlements was limited to 
six 
but the more than 100 existing settlements have been expanded 
since 1984 at an overall rate of 1500 housing units a year 
yosef margalit a housing ministry official said fewer israelis 
are willing to move to the west bank because of the violence 
about 300 palestinians gathered in nablus marketplace to 
protest anabtawis death and hurled stones at soldiers who 
responded with gunfire and rubber bullets according to witnesses 
officials at the al ittihad hospital in nablus said two 
demonstrators aged 22 and 23 were shot in the legs two others 
were injured by rubber bullets and two were treated for beating 
injuries 
army officials confirmed the shootings and said two soldiers 
were wounded by stones 
the army later imposed a curfew on much of nablus and two 
adjacent refugee camps confining 126000 palestinians to their 
homes indefinitely 
police spokesman alex lapidot said the attack in jerusalem 
occurred as two policemen were taking a 25yearold prisoner from 
the courthouse to his cell 
he said about 30 palestinians tried to free the prisoner and 
four other officers rushed to the scene to drive back the crowd 
one policeman suffered a broken hand and the others had minor 
injuries he said 
four of the attackers were finally subdued and arrested 
lapidot said the others managed to escape

sen lloyd bentsen will help the democratic 
ticket in texas but outside his home state he is virtually unknown 
to most voters and may have little effect on the presidential race 
pollsters said tuesday 
bentsen has scored low in polls on potential running mates for 
gov michael dukakis in a cbs newsnew york times survey last 
week only 3 percent of democratic primary voters picked bentsen 
from seven choices 
in an abc newswashington post poll completed monday less than 
onehalf of 1 percent named bentsen as their choice as a running 
mate for dukakis the telephone survey of 1100 registered voters 
conducted july 611 had a margin of error of plus or minus 35 
percentage points 
but dukakis choice of bentsen likely was based on a more 
practical measure than name recognition pollsters said bentsen 
gives dukakis a shot to win texas and its 29 electoral votes 
thirdlargest of any state 
its a highrisk technique youve got to beat george bush in 
his home state said claibourne darden an atlantabased 
pollster if dukakis can do that george bush will be whupped 
a statewide poll in texas in midjune had dukakis trailing vice 
president bush who maintains an apartment in houston by 23 
points but when bentsen was proposed as dukakis running mate the 
democrats trailed by just 5 points 
adding bentsen makes texas a competitive state said brad 
coker of masondixon opinion research which did that poll if 
theres a drawback its that bentsen doesnt guarantee texas that 
makes it risky for dukakis 
outside his state bentsen is unlikely either to help or hurt 
dukakis barring any damaging disclosures political pollsters 
said in the absence of controversy about a running mate they 
said voters tend to focus on the top of the ticket 
that was backed up by a florida poll by masondixon conducted 
during the weekend putting bush 10 points ahead of dukakis in 
florida with bentsen as well as without him only with sen bob 
graham of florida as a running mate did dukakis draw even with bush 
there wplgtv in miami reported 
generally other than in a running mates home state 
everybody says the choice can hurt but not help said harry 
oneill a pollster for the roper organization and president of the 
national council on public polls unless theres something really 
negative i dont think the vice presidential candidate matters in 
peoples minds one way or the other 
bentsen thus far barely is in the publics mind in a national 
gallup poll in midmay 77 percent of respondents said they had not 
heard enough about him to have an opinion of him of the rest 15 
percent rated him positively 9 percent negatively 
similarly in a harris poll in early may bentsen ranked fifth 
of eight choices for a vice presidential candidate far behind 
leaders jesse jackson and sen john glenn of ohio in the gallup 
poll a gauge that took negative ratings into account put glenn and 
sen bill bradley of new jersey on top 
there are many other vice presidential possibilities that are 
more popular than bentsen said larry hugick a gallup pollster 
basically the guy just does not have much name recognition on a 
national scale 
still pollsters noted many other vice presidential candidates 
have been littleknown democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 
republican spiro agnew in 1968 and republican william miller in 
1964 for example and dukakis himself was unknown by 77 percent 
of the public as recently as november 
where he is known in texas bentsen was rated favorably by 55 
percent of respondents to the masondixon poll last month and 
unfavorably by 12 percent bush had the same favorable rating but 
much higher unfavorables 33 percent dukakis was rated favorably 
by 39 percent unfavorably by 29 percent 
in his senate reelection contest bentsen led republican 
challenger rep beau boulter by 6027 even if bentsen runs for 
vice president and for the senate at the same time respondents 
said they would favor him by 5827 
coker noted that the texas numbers well may change at least in 
part because many texans may not have taken the suggestion of 
bentsen for vice president seriously 
such apparently was the case with pollsters themselves hugick 
noted that gallup just completed a poll during the weekend that 
tested two possible dukakis running mates glenn and sen albert 
gore of tennessee 
we picked the wrong southerner he said

president reagan on tuesday ordered the 
expulsion of nicaraguas ambassador and seven of his diplomatic 
colleagues in a returnthefavor reprisal for the ouster of 
eight american envoys to managua 
at the same time reagan refused to rule out severing us 
relations with the leftist sandinista government saying it 
remains an option 
reagan said the expulsion order would affect nicaraguan 
ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven other diplomats 
but tunnermann also is nicaraguas ambassador to the 
organization of american states and questions were raised as to 
whether the united states as host country can legally expel oas 
envoys 
at one point white house spokesman marlin fitzwater indicated 
that tunnermann would be allowed to remain in the united states 
when he said the envoy simply wont be ambassador to the united 
states 
but a state department official said the administration has 
every intention of revoking tunnermanns visas and expelling him 
he can scream all the way to the airport said one official 
insisting on anonymity 
tunnermann went to the state department for consultations late 
tuesday afternoon 
afterward tunnermann said the united states has no right to 
expel a diplomat assigned to the oas and said it was the first case 
in oas history in which a diplomat accredited to that body has been 
ordered out of the country 
but he stopped short of saying he would fight the expulsion 
order saying that he had to consult first with his government 
tunnermann said that under secretary of state michael armacost 
had told him he had engaged in activities as oas ambassador which 
violate diplomatic norms 
when tunnermann demanded that armacost present proof he quoted 
armacost as saying well some day 
later state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley said 
that tunnermann had engaged in an abuse of his privileges of 
residence of residence in the united states 
she said that major pedro sampson mendoza nicaraguas military 
attache who also was on the list of those expelled was guilty of 
the same offense 
mrs oakley declined to specify what abuses tunnermann and 
sampson mendoza had committed when reminded by reporters that 
reagan had described the expulsions as retaliation she said the 
diplomats were being ordered out both as a retaliatory measure and 
for the alleged abuses 
meanwhile house minority leader robert michel rill said 
that in a meeting that he and other congressmen had with reagan 
national security adviser colin d powell said us ambassador 
richard melton recommended against cutting off relations 
the latest flareup in mostly icy relations that have existed 
since the sandinistas overthrew dictator anastasio somoza in 1979 
prompted white house spokesman marlin fitzwater to brand managuas 
expulsion order and political crackdown as black eyes for the 
peace process 
secretary of state george p shultz traveling in the far east 
called nicaraguas ouster of melton and the other us diplomats 
action an absolute outrage 
and the state department listed a series of actions capped by 
mondays closing of la prensa and radio catolica that it said are 
directed against the political opposition labor and press in 
nicaragua 
the expulsions came amid growing indications of a softening of 
opposition in congress to a renewal of us military aid to the 
contra rebels seeking to topple the sandinistas 
reagan asked whether he was putting off a new move to get 
congress to approve military aid for the contras replied were 
not waiting were working on that 
maybe now some of the congressional apologists will get on 
board now and support the contras said senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas 
house majority leader thomas foley dwash an opponent of 
contra aid said its going to have a damaging effect on the 
opinion of the sandinistas performance in the peace process in 
congress 
i wouldnt say now that the congress is going to vote military 
aid but it certainly strengthens the hand of the administration if 
it seeks to get military aid for the contras foley said on 
cbstvs this morning program 
michel said he could not understand those who have been 
supporting nicaraguan president daniel ortega and the sandinistas 
in the congress or at least tipping the scales in their favor 
whenever they can 
in my judgment it weakens their position it strengthens 
ours and we ought to call them to task for it he said 
sen christopher j dodd dconn a contra aid opponent said 
that the reagan administration decision to expel the nicaraguan 
diplomats just fans this problem and expands it 
the administration sees this situation as its best opportunity 
in months to get back the military aid for the resistance in 
nicaragua he said 
dodd said he was not surprised at managuas decision to 
expel the us diplomats given the long hostility between the two 
governments but he termed the sandinista governments closing of 
la prensa and the catholic radio station a major setback 
i think it is a violation of the commitments they have made 
said dodd chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
latin america i think its a victory for extreme voices in 
nicaragua and in washington 
congress rejected a 362 million package which included a 
proposed 35 million for a military escrow account in february 
in late march it approved a 48 million bill providing only 
humanitarian aid through sept 30 and only 17 million of that was 
earmarked for the contras 
supporters of aid to the contras in the senate have said they 
will seek an amendment to the defense department appropriations 
bill as early as this week to renew military aid 
nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto said monday that 
melton and seven us embassy aides were ordered to leave the 
country within 72 hours because they were engaged in activities 
complementary to the state terrorism the administration of us 
president ronald reagan is carrying out against nicaragua 
the nicaraguans said embassy officials were at an opposition 
demonstration in nandaime about 40 miles from managua on sunday 
but a state department statement said the united states 
rejects the sandinista pretext for these expulsions 
the ambassador and the embassy maintain contact with as wide a 
spectrum of nicaraguan citizens as possible including labor 
groups the press and the internal political opposition it said 
these activities are the normal duties of us officials 
overseas 
reagan disclosed the us retaliatory order during an oval 
office picturetaking session with sheik saad alabudllah alsabah 
the crown prince and prime minister of kuwait 
i have told the state department to send their ambassador and 
seven comrades back to managua he said 
asked if was going to sever relations with managua the 
president replied no then added that the other is a 
possibility always that we could do but well just return those 
individuals 
in other words were going to return the favor reagan 
said were going to do to him what he did to us 
in addition to tunnermann and sampson mendoza the other 
nicaraguans being expelled are maureen sampson manuel cordero 
sofia clark descoto orlando martin vega gutierrez zelmira garcia 
and angel arce 
the nicaraguan diplomats were being given 72 hours to leave the 
country 
the us responded to the expulsion of three diplomats in 1983 
by closing several nicaraguan consulates in the united states the 
us diplomats were accused of taking part in an alleged plot to 
poison descoto

rep gerry e studds dmass tuesday called 
a dispute over the current expansion plan for the san francisco bay 
wildlife refuge a tempest in a salt marsh and ordered further 
examination of the proposal 
studds comments came at a hearing of the subcommittee on 
fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment which 
examined a proposal to double the size of the refuge 
the 21662 acre tract of land and water was set aside by 
congress 16 years ago to protect remnant tidal wetlands and their 
indigenous species at the south end of san francisco bay in 
northern california 
last december president reagan signed into law legislation 
authorizing additional appropriations to complete acquisition of 
the original bondaries of the refuge 
but administration officials tuesday opposed the purchase of 
20850 acres of seasonal wetlands and salt ponds 
the administration does not believe additional land purchases 
are warranted at this time especially in light of the 131 
million already spent on land acquisition said william f hartwig 
of the us fish and wildlife service 
paul shepherd vice president and land manager of leslie salt 
which owns 85 percent of the land slated for purchase argued that 
landowners were not told of the proposed annexation until they saw 
their property on a map 
although the legislation states that additions to the refuge may 
only be acquired from willing sellers shepherd said this type of 
notice was tantamount to having a federal lein on the property 
but mayor gus morrison of fremont calif supported the 
legislation saying the socalled condemnation clause which 
outlines how the land purchases must be made solves many of the 
problems cited by opponents 
however newark nj mayor david w smith noted that the 
expansion plans would absorb almost half of his citys land 
including a section earmarked for industrial development by city 
planners 
newarks residential development is virtually in place we 
need additional industrial development to complement it he said 
one section scheduled for purchased is 44 percent of my city 
anytime the federal government draws a line on a map and says 
this is what we designate as a refuge smith added that land 
becomes holy ground and it becomes impossible to develop it for any 
other prupose in the san francisco bay area 
i think hes wrong morrision said of smith i just have 
failed in convincing him and i dont know why if he keeps rigid 
control over how the land is used he wont have any trouble 
like the chairman said its just a tempest in a salt marsh 
morrison said

authorities said tuesday the terrorists 
who attacked a greek cruise ship may have been proiranian arabs 
trying to hijack it and released photographs of three men and a 
woman allegedly involved 
the terrorists who apparently boarded as passengers fired 
automatic weapons and hurled grenades monday on the city of poros 
which was taking 471 foreign tourists on a oneday cruise through 
the greek islands 
city coroner manolis nonas reported 10 people dead and harbor 
officials said another body had been found but the merchant marine 
ministry put the toll at nine dead and 98 injured there was no 
explanation for the discrepancies in the death count 
several survivors and a harbor official said tuesday the 
attackers joined fleeing passengers in jumping from the ship and 
were picked up with them by vessels that rushed to aid the city of 
poros 
two french survivors not identified appeared on state 
television and one said we saw them jumping out of the ship and 
a number of other passengers said they saw the terrorists aboard 
the rescue boats going to piraeus 
police had said monday night the terrorists escaped on a waiting 
speedboat police officials would not comment about the reports 
tuesday 
officials also made conflicting statements about the number of 
people involved in the attack for which no group has claimed 
responsibility 
a senior officer of the piraeus harbor authority said the attack 
might be linked to the trial in piraeus scheduled for this week 
of mohammed rashid a palestinian wanted by the united states in 
the 1982 bombing of a pan am jet over hawaii the officer spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
we theorize they were going to seize the ship together with 
the people who died in the car explosion maybe to force the 
freeing of the palestinian on trial the officer said 
anastasios sehiotis minister of public order released the 
photos and told reporters these pictures are being circulated to 
all airports harbors and border entry points these people were 
involved with yesterdays attack 
sehiotis also indicated an explosion earlier monday that killed 
two men in a car was linked to the ship attack the car blew up 
near the trocadero marina home dock of the city of poros and the 
ship was attacked about six hours later at 840 pm 
the minister would give no further information except for the 
names of two lebanese men being sought as involved in this 
attack 
he identified them as hamoud abdul hamid 36 who rented the 
car and mohammed zozad 21 thought to be one of the men on the 
ship sehiotis said both had been in greece since may 
the two other men were not identified and it was not clear 
whether they were on the ship the woman in the photo was not 
identified but the picture appeared to have been taken aboard the 
vessel 
survivors said they saw three attackers one masked with a 
stocking fire at people on the ship and hurl several hand 
grenades the explosions started a fire that brought the sun deck 
crashing down on passengers in the lounge below 
but the piraeus harbor authority officer said he believed the 
attack was carried out by two men and two women who boarded the 
cruise ship when it called at the island of aegina 
he said survivors identified zozad in one of the photographs and 
recognized the young woman in the other photograph released by the 
ministry 
one woman we think had a moroccan passport and the other a 
french passport we think they found out about the car explosion 
and decided to shoot up the ship the officer said 
in paris a woman was quoted as saying she was the mother of the 
french woman identified in one photograph 
the woman who identified herself only as mrs bismuth called 
the agence francepresse news agency and said she saw the picture 
on the tuesday evening news she was quoted as saying her daughter 
isabelle 21 was a secretary vacationing in greece and not a 
terrorist mrs bismuth said she hasnt heard from her daughter 
since the attack the agency reported 
a spokesman for the merchant marine ministry said 23 people 
remained hospitalized tuesday 
seven americans were on the cruise but none was among the 
injured the spokesman said greek staterun tv said an american 
identified as carl johns was killed but the us embassy said they 
were unaware of any such person 
palestinian terrorists hijacked the italian cruise ship achille 
lauro during a mediterranean cruise in october 1985 and killed a 
69yearold american passenger leon klinghoffer italian courts 
convicted seven palestinians 
rashid 34 was scheduled for trial wednesday on charges of 
entering the country with a forged passport but prison officials 
said it would be postponed because of a nationwide work slowdown by 
prison guards the government says it is considering a us 
extradition request for rashid 
us officials say rashid put a bomb on a pan am plane that 
exploded on a tokyohonolulu flight in april 1982 killing a 
japanese teenager and wounding 15 people he was arrested at the 
athens airport june 1 
police said the car that exploded contained automatic weapons 
hand grenades and ammunition and a large amount of explosives 
a police spokesman speaking privately said an iranian magazine 
also was found in the wreckage he said a beretta automatic pistol 
and fragments of sovietmade hand grenades found on the city of 
poros were identical with weapons recovered from the car 
wreckage 
the merchant marine ministry said only two of the bodies had 
been identified antonis demaizis 45 the ships first mate and 
klaus johan grabas a 33yearold danish tourist the ship carried 
22 crew members

and given three choices slander the soviet union in the west be 
executed or be sent to the soviet union where as a deserter he 
was told no mercy would be shown

home his request was granted tass did not say then what became of 
ryzhkov but on tuesday it quoted a report in the weekly newspaper

colony than in alien america that he felt calm according to 
tass 
the newspaper wrote that ryzhkovs release shows fear of 
punishment should not deter soviet deserters from returning home

a group of local christian leaders 
appealed to universal studios tuesday to destroy the film the 
last temptation of christ saying it portrays jesus as a 
mentally deranged and lustdriven man 
it is the most serious misuse of film craft in the history of 
filmmaking the rev lloyd john ogilvie senior pastor of the 
first presbyterian church of hollywood said at a news conference 
attended by four other prominent area christians 
members of the group acknowledged they have not seen the movie 
but said they believed the film contains a dream sequence in which 
christ comes off his cross and has sex with mary magdalene 
universal reaffirmed it would release the film this fall it 
said the christians were advocating censorship and were criticizing 
a film after declining an invitation to see it 
consequently much of what they are saying is inaccurate and 
exaggerated said a statement released by codistributors 
universal pictures and cineplex odeon films 
the studio has billed the last temptation of christ as a 
look at the human side of jesus the movie is directed by martin 
scorsese who once studied for the priesthood and stars willem 
dafoe as jesus barbara hershey as mary magdalene and harvey keitel 
as judas iscariot 
scheduled for release to a few theaters on sept 23 the movie 
is based on greek author nikos kazantzakis 1955 book the last 
temptation of christ which was condemned as heretical by the 
greek orthodox church 
universal held a private screening of the movie in new york 
tuesday 
the rev dave pomeroy director of media resources for the 
national council of churches attended the screening he said it 
was a fascinating film it will certainly continue to engender the 
kind of controversy its already doing 
the movie like kazantzakis book shows jesus tempted not to 
die on the cross pomeroy said 
the point that is being missed by the critics is that he 
rejects that temptation to live out his life span and die as a 
man he said what needs to be noted is this is a movie of a 
novel not a movie of the gospel story 
i havent actually had a good nights sleep in several weeks 
i wake up in the middle of the night and wonder how could someone 
do this to the most wonderful person who walked the face of the 
earth dr bill bright founder and president of san 
bernardinobased campus crusade for christ said at the news 
conference 
the group asked universal to cancel the release of the film and 
destroy all copies of it and urged christians and nonchristians 
alike to write or call mca inc universals parent company 
they said they were basing their protest on two versions of the 
script they had seen and reports by an unidentified person inside 
universal pictures who had seen the film 
the content of both the script and the film portrayed jesus 
christ as a mentally deranged and lustdriven man who in a 
dream sequence comes down off the cross and has a sexual 
relationship with mary magdalene said larry poland president of 
mastermedia international inc a highland calif christian 
consulting firm 
the rev jack hayford pastor of the church on the way in van 
nuys joined ogilvie in denying their appeal amounted to 
censorship he said universal was altering factual biblical history 
in the film 
universal pictures had hired a bornagain christian marketing 
consultant tim penland who advised on the films chariots of 
fire and the mission to help ward off controversy 
penland resigned in june he said tuesday he couldnt finish 
reading the script which he called biblically inaccurate 
the group said universal had promised to show a rough cut of the 
movie in june but canceled it the group members said they declined 
to attend tuesdays screening because it was too close to the 
release date to force any changes in the movie 
universal said in its statement tuesday that scorsese deeply 
believes that this film is a religious affirmation of faith 
marion billings a publicist for the director of taxi driver 
and raging bull did not return phone calls tuesday 
on monday the group placed a fullpage advertisement in the 
hollywood reporter an entertainment newspaper urging universal 
not to release the film the ad was signed by 61 christians in the 
entertainment industry 
also monday poland called for a christian boycott of any 
product connected with universal or mca an entertainment 
conglomerate that includes movie and television production 
amusement tours of its studios as well as mca records and book and 
licensing divisions

republican george bush told blacks tuesday his 
presidency would mark a new day after the reagan 
administration promising i will be personally involved in 
protecting the civil rights of all americans 
appearing before the 79th convention of the naacp the vice 
president promised you will be heard i promise you that youre 
going to be called on youre going to be partners in my 
presidency 
bush sure to be the republican presidential nominee also paid 
tribute to jesse jackson the runnerup in the democratic 
presidential primaries 
while saying he had profound policy differences with jackson 
bush said i salute him for running the race for being heard 
and he deserves a salute from us the audience of several 
thousand people applauded loudly and generally gave bush a warm 
response 
in his speech bush made no mention of the selection of texas 
sen lloyd bentsen as the running mate of michael dukakis the 
presumed democratic presidential nominee later when reporters 
asked for comment he replied thats interesting thats what i 
think about it 
the vice presidents remark came as he traveled aboard air force 
two to cincinnati for the major league allstar game tuesday night 
bush threw out the first pitch of the game he took off his 
jacket and dramatically threw it down near the mound then wound up 
and made his pitch almost over the head of gary carter catcher 
for the new york mets 
dukakis was to address the naacp on wednesday the day after 
bush did 
republicans traditionally have not had much luck in attracting 
black voters the reagan administration has been criticized 
repeatedly by blacks particularly for its record on civil rights 
and aid to the poor 
bush however has a relationship with many black leaders in 
introducing bush naacp executive director benjamin hooks praised 
the vice presidents long and distinguished record of public 
service and called him a man of honor and integrity 
using a baseball analogy bush told the naccp that as a 
candidate for president im not just in the ondeck circle any 
more im at the plate and let me just say it is a new day 
he promised that i will have a positive civil rights agenda 
i guarantee you i will be personally involved in protecting the 
civil rights of all americans this effort will be at the top of 
the agenda of my attorney general and he or she will be directly 
accountable to me for results 
the audience respounded with applause and cheers 
bush said he did not intend to concede the vote of any american 
but acknowledged its tough for republicans to win over blacks 
i need your help i know ill get your constructive 
criticism he said amid chuckles from the audience thats all 
right you will be heard i promise you that bush said 
bush said his commitment to include blacks was was not dependent 
on his receiving a certain percentage of the black vote 
im a realist you all are realists bush said im going 
to do better than people think in that regard 
he promised that i will have minority men and women of 
excellence as fullscale partners in my administration he said 
black leaders like hooks will always be welcome at my house even 
when my house is your house the white house 
bush credited the reagan administration with building a record 
of economic success and said that a third of all black families 
now earn more than 25000 a year but theres much more left to 
be done bush said 
he said the government can be involved in dealing with problems 
such as pregnancy among unwed black teenage girls and the high 
rate of black school dropouts however he added the answer also 
lies in the values that are passed on from generation to generation 
values like family faith education the importance of work 
we must teach kids the difference between right and wrong we 
must teach them how to say no to drugs and no to teenage 
pregnancy we must stop the cycle of babies having babies and we 
must emphasize the importance of family and work and education 
bush promised that his first budget would seek a dramatic 
increase in funding for the head start program

iran said tuesday the terrorist attack on 
a greek cruise ship in the aegean sea may have been carried out by 
the cia to whitewash the us downing of an iranian airliner

difficulty in the face of world public opinion and political and 
international circles after its navy shot down the iran air a300 
airbus on july 3 killing all 290 people aboard 
in view of the nature of imperialism and its inhuman attitude

opened fire with automatic weapons and hurled grenades aboard the 
greek cruise ship city of poros

speculation as a pack of lies he spoke in an interview in 
athens with tehrans official islamic republic news agency 
irna monitored in nicosia quoted him as saying we 
categorically condemn such acts of terrorism against innocent 
people which damage the interests of a friendly and peaceloving 
country like greece

atlanta mayor andrew young told the largest 
black sorority on tuesday that americas 152 billion trade deficit 
can be blamed on the nations failure to cooperate with business 
people of different races around the globe 
we have a trade deficit because we in big business are still 
uncomfortable if the environment is dominated by people of color 
young told about 4000 members of delta sigma theta sorority 
if we are going to end the trade deficit without death and 
conflict it will be when blacks and whites male and female young 
and old protestant catholic and jew are able to work together 
said young 
the ambassador to the united nations during the carter 
administration urged members of the worlds largest organization of 
collegeeducated black women to extend the sisterhood and

a south african official on tuesday 
reported rapid progress in meetings with angolan cuban and us 
officials on a withdrawal of cuban troops from angola and ending 
south african rule over neighboring namibia 
as he boarded a ferry tuesday morning for a second day of 
private talks on governors island in new yorks harbor neil van 
heerden the head of the south african delegation was asked about 
the progress of the meetings 
he replied they had developed further than cairo and london 
the sites of the previous fourparty discussions 
south africa has said it would accept a un security council 
resolution calling namibias independence under black majority rule 
once the estimated 50000 cuban troops pull out cuban troops are 
fighting alongside angolan government forces against usbacked 
anticommunist rebels 
the head of the angolan delegation gen antonio dos santos 
franca said of mondays talks it went well he made the brief 
comment while returning to his hotel 
a news conference is expected wednesday according to officials 
involved in the talks 
the four parties first met in london in early may and then 
reconvened late last month in cairo egypt south african and 
angolan officials held a separate meeting in may in brazzaville 
congo 
the timetable for the withdrawal of the cubans is probably the 
most difficult unresolved issue us officials have said speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span that the un resolution sets for granting 
independence to namibia also called southwest africa 
angola and cuba have insisted that the cuban withdrawal should 
take place over four years but the us officials believe that is 
an opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peace 
talks proceed 
angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from 
namibia into angola to support the rebel forces known as unita or 
national union for the total independence of angola in their 
clashes with cuban and angolan forces

hungarys communist party and 
government leader karoly grosz appealed on tuesday for public 
support of a stringent economic program and harshly criticized the 
work of his government over the past year 
what lies ahead are sacrifices for the sake of the future 
grosz said on an evening televisoin interview he said it could 
take 10 to 15 years for his program to show results 
it was the first time a hungarian government chief has evaluated 
his first year in office 
grosz said he was very dissatisfied with the achievements of 
the last 12 months despite the efforts to implement a program of 
austerity measures and economic restructuring introduced last year 
grosz said the government economic experts and individual 
citizens have not been working efficiently enough 
the 20minute interview was conducted on the eve of a meeting of 
the party central committee that is to discuss two alternative 
economic programs 
one would push through radical reforms towards a more 
marketoriented economy this however could lead to 80000 to 
100000 unemployed and result in greater social tensions the 
second would introduce changes more gradually 
the party newspaper nepszabadsag published details of the 
proposals on saturday the first time the agenda of a central 
committee meeting was published in advance in such detail 
grosz said economic restructuring would mean hard times for 
hungarians as it aims to stop the growth of hungarys foreign 
debt now totaling 18 billion by 1990 
the government this year introduced east europes first 
valueadded and personal income tax as part of its austerity 
program a valueadded tax is a form of indirect sales tax 
parliament and the people are increasingly impatient and 
there is increasing social pressure on the government to do 
better grosz said 
he appealed to hungarians to understand the need for the 
program which will include curbs on imports cuts in subsidies to 
lossmaking firms and bankruptcy proceedings for those companies 
which continue to lose money unemployment already is to affect 
about 50000 people this year 
grosz said the leadership planned to push ahead with its program 
and is ready to face any tensions that might be involved he 
said steps will be taken that will strike hard at some sections 
of society but that he could not afford to be indulgent 
he said more attention should be devoted to industries with a 
future such as telecommunications and tourism

caesars hotel casino agreed tuesday 
to donate 100000 to two state hospitals as a precedentsetting 
settlement in a case involving civil charges that the gaming hall 
allowed a teenage girl to gamble 
caesars will donate 50000 each to the john f kennedy medical 
center in edison and marlboro state hospital in marlboro both of 
which have facilities to treat compulsive gambling 
the settlement involved a complaint that the gaming hall treated 
a 16yearold girl as a high roller offering her complimentary 
drinks a hotel room meals and show tickets 
debra kim cohen now 18 pleaded guilty in january to underage 
gambling and agreed to attend gamblers anonymous meetings as part 
of a oneyear probationary sentence 
state administrative law judge stephen thompson accepted the 
settlement on tuesday calling it novel and creative 
anthony j parrillo director of the state division of gaming 
enforcement said he was satisfied with the outcome of the 
complaint which also was filed against caesars and four other 
casinos elsinores atlantis resorts international harrahs 
marina and trump plaza casino hotels are expected to settle their 
complaints by the end of this week he said 
the 100000 settlement is the largest that a casino has ever 
paid in an underage gambling offense prior to tuesdays agreement 
casinos paid an average of 2000 per incident parrillo said 
before the complaints were filed parrillo said the problem 
of juvenile gambling in this state went largely unnoticed much 
less treated and remedied 
not only did the dge complaint serve to elevate the industrys 
consciousness of this serious problem he said but the 
settlement we have struck today hopes to achieve some social good 
by dedicating substantial monies to mental health facilities in 
this state where compulsive gambling and other disorders may be 
treated 
lloyd d levenson an attorney for caesars said the casino 
acknowledged that in miss cohens case our security force broke 
down which we have since tightened up 
levenson said he was hired to attend municipal court hearings to 
push for stiff penalties against underage gamblers who slip past 
the casinos security guards 
we want to send a message out to other young people 
levenson said

a growing number of investors are using 
opals like money on floridas gulf coast bartering the 
semiprecious stones for mercedesbenz automobiles and real estate 
sometimes worth millions of dollars 
the opals have been used to satisfy all or part of the selling 
price in these deals and the sellers then use the opals in other 
transactions the sarasota heraldtribune reported monday 
some experts cautioned that it can be difficult if not 
impossible to cash in on the appraised value of the semiprecious 
stones especially in large quantities 
the exchange system has not yet resulted in large liquidations 
of opals for cash jewelers said 
the opals take on the character of currency said john 
daunt a master gemologist and owner of gemstone corp of america 
in sarasota 
gerry manning president of manning opal co in new york said 
buyers may be surprised when they try to resell their stones 
top grade opals have a worldwide market but stones sold in 
large quantities seldom achieve their retail value manning said 
very often in my experience the values are incredibly 
overstated there is no secondary market for these stones he 
said 
there is no place to convert them to cash agreed arthur 
heilsberg a real estate agent who has been involved in 
transactions involving opals 
but he added if the stones can be turned over in another 
deal who cares what theyre all worth in cash 
when frank byars sold his troubled tiki gardens tourist 
attraction in the pinellas county city of indian shores he 
accepted 1 million in opals as part of the reported 3 million 
package 
byars is reluctant to discuss the sale asked if he thought he 
got a fair deal he said no i cant sell them the opals 
one local gemologist cited another deal with an unnamed 
purveyor of opals in which a lawyer agreed to sell a mercedesbenz 
for the semiprecious stones 
two australians neville schmidt and darrell roder have 
contracted to buy several millions of dollars worth of property in 
manatee and sarasota counties using cash and opals as payment 
according to their trustee sarasota attorney peter jaensch 
in one deal sarasota real estate investor robert h jones sold 
them a shopping center and an office building in bradenton for 
millions in cash and opals 
schmidt and roder purchased the office building for 660000 
half in cash half in opals according to heilsberg an agent with 
vpn general realty who handled the transaction 
he said the australians are trading black opals which they 
obtain from a mine they own in australia 
janet post owner of janet f post jewelry amp antiques in 
sarasota said she has appraised the australians opals dozens 
and dozens of times 
post has provided what she called retail replacement 
appraisals to her clients who pay her 50 an hour that appraisal 
judges what a stone would be worth if it were bought at a retail 
jewelry store set in jewelry these types of appraisals are most 
commonly used to value a stone for insurance purposes 
an average per carat price for a fine stone has been from 
250 to 1500 per carat post said 
she said she has never provided or been asked to provide a 
fair market value for the opals or what they would be worth if 
turned into cash

jesse jackson said tuesday he was too 
controlled too mature to be angry about being passed over for 
the no 2 spot on the democratic ticket 
but in an emotional speech to the naacp tuesday night hours 
after sen lloyd bentsen of texas was tapped as michael dukakis 
running mate jackson shouted out a message of pride and defiance 
i will never surrender he said as the crowd cheered and 
surged to its feet one thing i know i may not be on the ticket 
but im qualified thats what i know qualified 
dukakis was to address the naacp convention on wednesday 
earlier tuesday jackson who learned from reporters about 
dukakis choice of bentsen refrained from rendering any explicit 
judgment on the selection of the texas senator for the spot jackson 
himself coveted 
since i have had no opportunity for indepth discussion with 
senator bentsen and have had no prior discussion with governor 
dukakis about his recommendation it would be inappropriate for me 
to comment upon it jackson told a crowded news conference 
asked if he was angry the civil rights leader said no im 
too controlled im too clear im too mature to be angry im 
focused on what we must do to keep hope alive anger reflects a 
crisis in emotions and therefore irrational behavior ive simply 
been in this struggle long enough to keep my eyes on the prize 
but the disappointment was palpable for jackson who 24 hours 
earlier had sat for a twohour interview with paul brountas the 
dukakis campaign chairman who led the search for a vice president 
although jackson had specifically told brountas where he was 
staying in cincinnati monday night and what time he was leaving to 
return to washington dukakis did not reach jackson by telephone 
until an hour after reporters informed jackson as he landed in 
washington 
even as jackson was leaving the airport bentsen was there 
preparing to board a private plane for the flight to boston and the 
announcement with dukakis jackson and bentsen did not meet 
jackson attributed the selection to a strategy decision by the 
dukakis campaign and said my obligation is not to react to his 
strategy but to affirm my own it is to keep hope alive to keep 
focus in our campaign to keep our delegates and supporters 
disciplined detailed and full of hope 
asked if he would encourage his supporters to enthusiastically 
back the dukakisbentsen ticket jackson said we can only 
address that after the nomination is over on wednesday night 
i no doubt will support the ticket that the convention elects 
next week but that will be the appropriate time he said adding 
that in the meantime he awaits further discussions on minority 
planks his role in the party and our strategies to win after the 
nomination 
asked if black voters might stay home in november jackson said 
this is no time for us to proceed based upon threats it is a 
time to proceed based upon a shared commitment to expand 
participation in the process 
jackson said dukakis had indicated he would discuss his choice 
of a running mate with him beforehand but apparently changed his 
mind 
but i wouldnt be unduly concerned about the various strategic 
moves andor mistakes another camp makes we must keep our focus on 
what matters at the convention said jackson who predicted he 
would have 1300 delegates or nearly 30 percent of all delegates 
in atlanta 
for some people atlanta may mean a ratification process and 
even coronation for for others atlanta means a chance to express 
before the nation their basic concerns about the rights of workers 
and women and children and our quest for peace he said 
the convention for us is a serious culmination of many years 
of very hard and serious work hopefully when we leave there 
we will be a unified party a stronger party and will move on to 
victory said jackson 
if we have an exciting campaign in the summer and these 
grapes of hope remain buoyant and excited then their juice will be 
enough to stimulate us to victory in november but if somehow some 
misguided strategists crush grapes of hope in atlanta into raisins 
of despair they will not be able to bounce back in the fall 
jackson said 
he said his own presidential campaign was not like that of 
those who ran but surrendered my campaign never surrendered 
it continues to grow it continues to expand its the heart and 
soul of our party 
but other jackson supporters criticized dukakiss handling of 
the announcement 
rep charles rangel dny said i assume that dukakis 
announcement was not made to make a special appeal to black folks 
it was very unprofessional 
but rangel said it would be premature to discuss what blacks 
or others are going to do we are not walking away we are 
walking into the convention 
rep mickey leland dtexas the head of jacksons campaign in 
texas said if in fact rev jackson is not satisfied and not 
aggressive in this campaign in the fall the democrats are going 
to have a hard time winning 
but leland said the selection of bentsen puts texas in the win 
column for the democrats thats a fait accompli said leland 
who praised bentsen as a very effective legislator a friend and 
a colleague

defense minister rupert scholz ruled 
out a ban on lowlevel nato training flights tuesday despite 
growing calls that such flights be drastically reduced or 
eliminated after recent accidents 
lowlevel flights are necessary to maintain military security 
and readiness scholz was quoted as saying in the illustrated 
magazine quick 
citizens groups have charged that in addition to being 
dangerous noise from low levelflights makes life in heavily 
affected areas unbearable 
last week the parliament of rhineland palatinate state approved 
a nonbinding resolution calling for an end to the flights 
scholz was quoted as saying he is looking for ways to sharply 
reduce the number of military training flights within west germany 
he said one alternative could be to require that pilots spend more 
time in flight simulators 
another solution could be to expand the flight areas outside 
the country the quick article did not elaborate 
a military expert belonging to chancellor helmut kohls 
governing christian democrat party was quoted as saying other 
options include asking nato pilots to copy west german training 
methods of descending to a low altitude only just before the 
aircraft reaches its training target 
willy wimmer also was quoted as saying in an interview with the 
augusburg allgemein newspaper tuesday that planners are considering 
allowing fighters to use nowrestricted airspace along the border 
with east germany 
wimmer said the restricted area now 18 miles wide along the 
western side of the border could be reduced 
last week a west german air force f4 phantom fighter jet 
crashed and exploded in a field 
two weeks ago three us air force f16s crashed in one day in 
two separate accidents one pilot was killed when two jets collided

edgar m bronfman head of the world jewish 
congress said tuesday a good chance exists of reaching 
agreement this fall on east german reparations to holocaust 
survivors 
but he expressed some reservations about the east german 
proposal during a visit to berlin and said payments must be on a 
no strings attached basis 
he also called on austrians to face up to their countrys nazi 
past 
bronfman is on a threeday visit to west berlin and west germany 
that includes a meeting with chancellor helmut kohl in bonn 
in 1952 west germany agreed with the new yorkbased world 
jewish congress to compensate victims of the nazi holocaust since 
then officials in bonn have paid out more than 48 billion to 
survivors and their families 
the communist east german government had argued that because 
east germany came into existence as a nation in 1949 it had no 
legal responsibility for the atrocities of adolf hitlers regime 
more than 6 million jews were killed during hitlers third reich 
diplomatic sources at the united nations speaking on condition 
of anonymity have said east germanys refusal to pay reparations 
or accept legal responsibility for war crimes has been a major 
stumbling block in improving relations with the united states 
then on june 8 the east german government announced it was 
willing to provide humanitarian aid to jewish survivors 
the amount being discussed is up to 100 million according to 
west berlin jewish leaders details of the plan have not been made 
public 
bronfman said of the plan tuesday well have to see what its 
hooked up to its not clear to me that its as openhanded as 
it might be i just want to make sure that there are no strings 
attached 
asked if he doubted the east germans good faith bronfman 
replied no 
he confirmed he was invited to visit communist east german 
leader erich honecker and said he assumed the trip would take place 
in the fall 
asked if he would conclude a reparations agreement with the east 
germans in the autumn bronfman said theres a good chance 
the head of the world jewish congress praised west germany for 
its efforts to face up to the nazi past saying its a pleasure 
to come to a country where you see what west german governments 
since chancellor konrad adenauer have done to discuss the 
holocaust and teach children about it 
he added austria sits there as if they never took part in it 
the holocaust at all it talks about itself as the first victim 
thats all such nonsense and that has to be changed 
about 36500 jews still live in west berlin and west germany

the striking writers guild of 
america sued over a dozen leading producers tuesday claiming they 
are interfering illegally with guild efforts to sign contracts with 
independent producers 
the guilds antitrust lawsuit filed in us district court 
named 19 defendants including the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers the three television networks and several 
hollywood studios including disney universal and colombia 
guild attorneys said the defendants had refused to deal with 
some of the 151 independents that have signed interim contracts 
with the wga 
the suit alleges that such conduct is anticompetitive it seeks 
a court declaration that the defendants violated federal antitrust 
statutes and that they be ordered to halt such alleged activity 
i think it is appropriate that we respond in this way wga 
west executive director brian walton said at a news conference at 
guild headquarters 
alliance spokesman herb steinberg said the allegations in the 
suit have no merit 
the action only diverts attention from the real issue which 
is resolving the strike steinberg said 
representatives of independent film companies have complained to 
the guild of pressure to reject interim agreements union officials 
said 
all three networks have vowed publicly to refuse programming 
produced by the independents during the strike now in its 19th 
week the strike already has forced the networks to delay the start 
of their fall programming season 
the producers behavior is sad and lacks compassion guild 
president george kirgo said 
that the alliance continues to refuse to compromise wreaks 
enough havoc to conspire to prevent others from making a fair deal 
which would employee men and women in this industry is 
unconscionable 
the producers alliance has said that its last contract offer 
which the wga rejected by a 31 margin on june 22 is final the 
two sides are divided over payments for reruns of onehour shows 
domestically and all programs overseas the strike has resulted in 
sweeping layoffs throughout the entertainment industry 
a spokesman for a dissident group of scriptwriters called the 
writers coalition reacted negatively to the lawsuit 
we are tremendously distressed that at this point in the 
strike recourse is being left to the courts it seems to indicate 
a lack of urgency he said 
the coalition which claims to include over 300 of the wgas 
9000 members believes talks between the union and the producers 
are stalled and plans to meet thursday night in santa monica to 
discuss writers options the spokesman said he declined to 
say what those options might be 
there comes a point in time where working members can no 
longer take the losses he said

president reagans decision to pay families of 
the 290 people killed in the us downing of an iranian airliner is 
meeting resistance on capitol hill where some lawmakers say the 
gesture is premature and politically touchy 
reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater revealed the plans on 
monday saying reagan was motivated by humanitarian concerns and 
was acting out of charity rather than obligation he made it clear 
that payments were to go to victims families and not to the tehran 
government of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
but some members of congress said that distinction may be 
largely lost on the us electorate which harbors longsimmering 
resentment of iran stemming from the seizure of the us embassy in 
1979 from its sponsorship of international terrorism and from the

with new players and an infusion of new 
money viewers of spanishlanguage television are getting a wider 
range of programming much of it now labeled made in the usa 
when spanishlanguage stations began on uhf channels in the 
early 1960s nearly all the programming was imported 
in 1986 hallmark cards inc and first chicago venture capital 
purchased the importer of most of the programming the 
mexicanowned network sin and its 11 related stations so far 
paying 585 million the network now called univision reaches 83 
percent of the nations hispanics through 450 stations and cable 
channels 
and since 1985 reliance capitals telemundo network has spent 
more than 300 million to build a network in 16 markets reaching 
about 60 percent of the nations 18 millionplus hispanics 
when youre david and the other guy is goliath you try new 
things said telemundo chief henry silverman 
in early 1987 both networks beefed up us news programs but 
continued to rely largely on latin americanproduced entertainment 
soap operas variety shows and sports now theyre looking at more 
us programs 
telemundo began coproducing its own news with atlantas cable 
news network in may and plans to offer an mtvproduced fridaynight 
music video show from new york this summer plus two daily game 
shows produced by inter telespan in los angeles 
univision produces 14 percent of its shows in the united states 
a ratio it plans to keep said program chief rosita peru 
nevertheless the network plans a womens magazine show from miami 
in september and a new music video show from los angeles this 
summer and will continue its monthly documentaries on us 
hispanics 
our no 1 program is sabado gigante said ms peru 
referring to a miamibased saturday night program mixing lively 
audience participation with games music and product promotions 
recognizing the viewing potential of anglos and bilingual 
hispanics both networks are experimenting with english the film 
camila an argentinian love story airs with english subtitles 
on univision in august telemundos rock show features videos and 
interviews in both languages 
both networks and their stations plan heavy coverage of the 
political conventions featuring reports by network news staffs and 
local reporters univision is airing preconvention specials and 
may broadcast up to 90 minutes of daily convention coverage 
doubling late night newscasts to one hour 
telemundo plans up to an hour of convention news a halfhour 
produced by its cnnbased network news staff and the rest produced 
by local news staffs at the convention for their stations 
mexicos televisa whose principals sold univision to hallmark 
earlier this year are also taking a second look at us hispanics 
some of televisas owners kept a stake in us television by 
continuing to operate galavision a spanishlanguage cable service 
this september galavision switches from movies soap opera and 
variety specials to a 24hour news format mexico citybased 
newscasts will use some mexican tv anchors and reporters but will 
target us hispanics and have reporters in seven cities north of 
the border 
over the years the competitive nature of spanish television 
has changed dramatically now theres univision and telemundo 
said galavisions starrett berry we wanted to come out with a 
format that would be dramatically different and unique to cable 
the relatively low cost of producing in latin america made 
imported entertainment a staple of us spanishlanguage 
television the recent moves are putting more us productions on 
the air but not without new costs 
its costing telemundo 4 million to shoot 140 episodes of a new 
soap opera in san antonio los angeles new york miami and puerto 
rico said silverman 
the best mexican novela soap opera would cost under 1 
million its four times the cost he said the show will be 
syndicated for airing in latin america but devaluation of the peso 
hurts potential returns on the investment 
still more us producers are looking at the growing hispanic 
audience inter telespan chief howard mercer said the time has 
come for the united states hispanic television audience to have the 
opportunity to view shows and participate in shows that have a 
particular relevancy to hispanic americans 
the growth also offers advertisers more choices in reaching 
hispanics in 1987 marketers spent 490 million to reach us 
hispanics up 23 percent from 1986 hispanic business magazine 
reports about 220 million went into spanish television a 56 
percent jump from 1986

nearly a quartercentury after visitors to the 
1964 new york worlds fair were introduced to the picturephone the 
seeasyou talk concept is being offered again 
the cost is lower but so is the technology 
unlike the moving images of the picturephone which let 
fairgoers see as well as hear the person on the other end of the 
wire the new devices produce only a freezeframe shot 
and industry analysts still question whether the home video 
phones time has come 
the issue is behavior said a michael noll a professor of 
communications at the university of southern california who worked 
for american telephone amp telegraph co in new product planning in 
the mid1970s 
using the telephone is akin to whispering in the ear seeing 
somebody almost destroys the intimacy of the communication he 
said when we ask an audience whether they want to see on the 
phone half or more say no 
mitsubishi officials recognize the psychological barrier 
picturephone ran into but the company believes its visitel visual 
phone display unit introduced in the united states last november 
will fare better 
visitel the only consumer product of its kind now on the us 
market has a camera lens that projects the users image onto a 
blackandwhite 45inch screen the image can be transmitted to 
another visitel user in about five seconds since the unit uses 
ordinary phone lines the same calling rates apply when the visitel 
is used as when an ordinary phone is used 
this is a passive product said tim beck national sales 
manager for the visual telecommunications division of mitsubishi 
electric sales of america its not like picking up the phone and 
immediately your picture is there it only transmits when you hit 
the send key he said 
beck said visitels retailing for about 400 each are selling 
very well the company has orders for about 64000 units and 
has delivered about 36000 of them he said 
two other japanese companies sony corp and matsushitas 
panasonic division are planning to put similar products on the 
market by christmas 
a variety of companies such as picturetel corp of peabody 
mass sell devices that transmit moving images but those are more 
expensive and require highergrade phone lines they are mostly for 
businesses 
atampts picturephone initially was aimed at the residential 
caller atampt set up phones at central locations in new york 
chicago and washington people could place calls from a 
picturephone at one of these locations to a picturephone at another 
location where family or friends would be awaiting their 
prearranged call 
atampt said it would extend service to other parts of the country 
if demand was large enough and a june 1964 press release said 
there is no telling when picturephone sets in the home will be as 
common as telephones are today 
the problem was the technology was just ahead of its time 
there wasnt the demand for it said gary whaite manager of 
atampts corporate staff for teleconferencing application 
development people didnt want themselves seen in what you would 
call the private home environment it just wasnt appealing to the 
public 
it was also expensive to install and to use rates ranged from 
16 to 27 for the first three minutes at one of the picturephone 
centers installing a picturephone in someones home would have 
cost thousands of dollars for special wiring to connect the device 
to the phone network 
atampt eventually turned its attention away from residential 
prospects and focused on the business community businesses were 
more receptive to twoway video but the growth of what came to be 
known as teleconferencing was also slow because of the high cost of 
equipment and the special circuits required 
even by the late 1970s it cost about half a million dollars to 
equip a room with video monitors cameras and special wiring 
whaite said 
technological advances began bringing the cost down 
significantly in the 1980s and by the mid1980s teleconferencing 
was becoming more attractive to companies trying to cut travel 
costs and open more lines of communication 
now an estimated 150 to 200 companies have their own 
teleconferencing networks ranging in size from two to 45 sites 
said elliot m gold a teleconferencing consultant based in 
altadena calif 
technology has much further to go before moving pictures can be 
transmitted over ordinary phone lines at reasonable costs to the 
consumer and estimates of when that will happen range from seven 
to 10 years at the earliest 
but even when the technology develops many see acceptance in 
the business community as the key to unlocking the residential 
market for video phones 
business started with personal computers and then they went 
into the home it followed the business application because lots of 
people take their work home whaite said 
home video phones will follow the same pattern but it will 
probably be a slower evolution and it will never get to the 
proportions it will in the business environment he said 
noll is more skeptical 
i dont think the problem is technology i think its 
behavior he said there is something inherent in people and 
the way they communicate that doesnt fit into this technology 
were 20 years into this idea seeasyoutalk phones and 
everybody is predicting its going to take off and it doesnt take 
off that should tell us something

fewer than a dozen politicians are among the 
delegates to the 1988 democratic national convention the partys 
biggest political event 
at least thats how many own up to being politicians 
an associated pess survey of more than 3200 of the 4161 
delegates to the convention found that while nearly 1000 of them 
hold elected offices including hundreds of members of congress 
and dozens of governors and mayors only a handful list their 
occupation as politician 
to be exact there are nine of them 
they join nearly 300 lawyers 100 retired people an actor a 
cook and a casket manufacturer this week as they cram into the 
cramped auditorium of the omni to nominate massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis for president 
of the delegates who hail from all 50 states the district of 
columbia and five us territories the typical conventiongoer 
is white middleaged and collegeeducated almost twothirds of 
them have not been delegates before the ap survey found 
their average age is 47 some 67 percent went to college and 69 
percent are white twentyone percent are black and almost 5 
percent are hispanic 
under democratic party rules the delegate seats are divided 
equally among men and women and while there are no firm quotas 
state parties were encouraged to recruit enough minorities so the 
racial mix of the delegation roughly parallels that of the states 
democratic voters 
still there was some irritation at the partys affirmative 
action program 
we went from unfair to more unfair said morton povman a 
dukakis delegate from new york under the rules a person can get 
the most votes and be elected by the people and yet not be selected 
as a delegate not because dukakis doesnt want you but because if 
youre a white catholic and they have enough white catholics 
theyll pick a black whatever 
while no floor fights are expected over the presidential 
nomination credentials challenges or changes to the rules the 
delegates come to town with a lot weighing on their minds 
a sampling of those surveyed by the ap found that about a third 
of them are worried about the federal budget deficit unemployment 
foreign trade or the economy in general next on the list is 
combatting the flow of illegal drugs into the united states 
followed by education and the twin issues of world peace and 
nuclear arms control 
i have a son who would be of age to go into service said 
hilda bourg a dukakis delegate from mississippi i want to keep 
the nation at peace 
asked his opinion of the nations no 1 issue charles logsdon 
a sheriff from elizabethtown ky replied as someone in law 
enforcement drugs i think we need to quit calling it a war and 
make it one 
even with few issues to be fought out and so few selfconfessed 
politicians in attendance politics that nasty business found 
its way into the process 
asked if she thought the democrats had devised a fair way of 
picking delegates cyrel foote a jackson delegate from kansas 
complained no theres a lot of politics involved

texas treasurer ann richards the keynote 
speaker for the democratic national convention says she learned 
how to act like a good ol boy from the best ol boy she knew her 
father 
as a child growing up in waco texas she would sometimes make 
the drugstore rounds with her father cecil willis a pharmaceutical 
salesman who knew that small talk could lead to big sales 
thats where i first learned how good ol boys talk to each 
other theres a lot of laughing and a lot of hurrahing and a lot 
of backslapping and a lot of fish stories ms richards recalled 
its tremendously important because it is a bond its a link 
that lays the predicate for whatever serious business you have to 
do it kept women out because we didnt know how to do it and 
were still not very good at it she said 
but those who have watched ms richards career say she has 
become a master at good ol boy talk and it is a key to her 
success in 12 years she has gone from housewife to county 
commissioner to state treasurer to likely candidate for governor in 
1990 
texas railroad commissioner john sharp state chairman of 
michael dukakis presidential campaign and a friend of ms 
richards remembers taking her to meet some oilmen friends in 
midland 
i came back from the rest room and richards and these oil guys 
were sitting there on their hands and knees shooting dice up 
against the wall had there been money passing hands those guys 
would still be paying debt she had all the little scraps of paper 
in front of her sharp said 
that little story probably illustrates the secret of her 
popularity she has never met a stranger she always fits in he 
said 
earlier in her life ms richards now 54 fit into the 
traditional female role of the day politics played little part in 
it 
i can remember a time in my life when i wouldnt give a recipe 
to a friend because that was the only form of power i had she 
has told many audiences 
she also remembers attending meetings of girls state which 
includes a mock legislature run by and for girls politics remained 
largely a spectator sport for females 
it was fun to pretend she said of the girls state sessions 
but you didnt really think you were going to ever go back and do 
it yourself i didnt think that until i was grown and had four 
kids 
her high school debate talents won her a scholarship to baylor 
university where she met david richards they married while in 
college she became a teacher in austin while he finished law 
school and later practiced law 
in 1976 some friends called the richards home and asked david 
to run for county commissioner he could not make the race so they 
turned to ms richards who had helped engineer victories for two 
female legislative candidates and she eventually said yes 
she upset an incumbent and kept the job until 1982 when she ran 
for state treasurer trying to follow two unlikelynamed treasurers 
jesse james who held the job for almost 40 years and warren 
harding who eventually was indicted for official misconduct 
ms richards took 47 percent of the vote and advanced to a 
democratic runoff against harding he withdrew and ms richards 
handily beat a gop challenger 
she was reelected without opposition in 1986 and has been 
credited with taking a quillpen agency into the computer era 
the political success came despite personal problems in 1980 
at her familys urging she sought treatment for alcoholism she 
says she has not had a drink since then 
in 1984 david and ann richards were divorced she said it was 
as amicable a split as possible david richards was on hand to 
congratulate his exwife on the day the democrats picked her as 
keynote speaker 
in her dozen years as an elected official ms richards has 
become a favorite speaker on the political circuit she uses her 
wicked wit to make points but not injure 
now are there any other white men who havent spoken yet 
she said when she recently followed several white men as speakers 
at a democratic fundraiser god knows we dont want to leave any 
of you out

nine drugs and vaccines created through 
biotechnology have reached the us market and 81 others are in the 
final stages of development according to an industrysponsored 
survey released today 
biotechnology a relatively young technology obviously has 
matured the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said in 
releasing what it called the most comprehensive survey on the 
subject to date 
a strong business commitment to biotechnology is benefiting the 
public by creating products that can unclog heart vessels ease 
transplants and treat diseases such as diabetes leukemia and 
hemophilia the washingtonbased group stated in a news release 
biotechnology is changing the very nature of this industry and 
will have a profound effect on medical treatment in the years 
ahead the groups president gerald j mossinghoff said in a 
prepared statement 
but the heated competition between companies also is leading to 
conflicts over property rights because many companies are at work 
on similar products the industry organization said 
uncertainty over property rights and lack of information about 
patents could lead to wasted resources longer development times 
and higher development costs the group said 
the survey also found 
forty of the 81 drugs and vaccines in development are for 
various types of cancers making cancer the most frequently 
targeted disease of biotechnologybased products 
seven of the 81 none yet approved are aimed at aids 
americans won 80 percent of the 206 genetic engineering patents 
issued by the us patent office last year while japan was a 
distant second with about 9 percent the survey found 
us corporations led the list of recipients of genetic 
engineering patents last year with 45 percent 
sloankettering institute the new york research institution 
was the top receipient of genetic engineering patents last year 
with 13 
but the rest of the top four were all private companies cetus 
corp with 11 ortho pharmaceutical corp with nine and 
genentech and eli lilly each with eight 
of the products already on the market the bestknown are 
genentech incs heart attack drug activase which dissolves blood 
clots merck amp co incs hepatitis b vaccine and eli lilly and 
cos geneticallyengineered human insulin for diabetics 
the 81 products in development include 67 that are being tested 
on people in clinical trials and 14 that have completed trials and 
are awaiting approval by the food and drug administration 
patent protection for biotechnology advances is critical because 
companies want to make sure that they will be able to earn a fair 
return on their heavy investments 
the office of patents and trademarks has cut down the backlog of 
biotechnology patent applications to 6500 from 7800 a year ago 
but it still takes an average of more than four years to process 
applications the pharmaceutical manufacturers association said 
to deal with the backlog the patent office is reorganizing and 
assigning a larger portion of new examiners at higher pay to 
biotech patents the goal is to cut the processing time to 18 
months by 1993 or 1994 the association said

in tokyo while share prices topped the 28000point barrier in 
active trading on the stock exchange 
the dollar started trading at 13290 yen before peaking at 
13308 yen its high for the day during the morning session it 
fell steadily in afternoon dealings before closing trading at 
13270 yen down 063 yen from mondays 13333 yen it reached a 
low of 13260 yen at one point 
the dollar is being thrown around by comments from various 
people in the financial circle said a dealer at a major 
securities firm speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said the currency reacted today to a statement by a 
highranking federal reserve board official that the united states 
is ready to tolerate a higher dollar 
the dollar is going to be sensitive until the release of us 
trade figures scheduled for friday said the dealer he added 
that the currency is likely to move between a range of 131133 yen 
prior to the announcement 
the dollar has been forced lower in the past by us trade 
reports showing a growing imbalance of imports over exports but 
recent reports have shown improvements in the trade gap and the 
us currency has stabilized 
however the dealer said sentiment in the market seemed to show 
that traders do not expect an improvement in the may figures the 
last two months were good so this time it may be bad he said 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues built on its 6891point gain registered monday and 
added a further 11385 points or 040 percent for a 2809984 
total by the end of trading 
the index last closed on the 28000point level on june 20 when 
it finished trading at 2813903 
the gain was better than expected said the securities 
dealer summer is usually a slow season for stock trading 
traders attributed the nikkei gain to activity centered on 
largecapital issues including steel and heavy industrials 
volume on the first section was estimated at 19 billion shares 
up from 11 billion shares monday 
prices will fluctuate said the dealer but the market is 
basically strong

japans trade surplus shrank 16 percent during the 
first half of 1988 as booming imports outstripped a moderate 
increase in exports the finance ministry reported tuesday 
analysts said the united states was a major beneficiary of the 
increased imports 
the ministry said in its preliminary report japans trade 
surplus during the first six months of the year was 337 billion 
or 64 billion less than in the first half of 1987 
in june the country had a surplus of 592 billion down 6683 
million from the same month last year 
japans surplus with the united states dipped 149 percent from 
246 billion to 209 billion for the first half of this year 
compared with the same period in 1987 
the ministry attributed the rapid decline in japans trade 
surplus to the steep increase in imports fueled by the nearly 100 
percent rise in the value of the japanese yen against the us 
dollar in the last three years 
the stronger yen made foreign products cheaper in japan and 
japanese products more expensive abroad 
the rising yen boosted the countrys imports by 343 percent to 
918 billion for the first six months of 1988 on a customcleared 
basis while exports rose 157 percent to 1254 billion 
the statistics showed american exporters bolstered by the weak 
dollar are increasing their sales in japan faster than european 
and asian exporters the united states is japans largest trading 
partner 
sumio hoga director of the ministrys export department said 
americans sold more office equipment aircraft and capital goods to 
japanese while japanese automobile exports to the united states 
continued its downward trend 
the united states is clearly a beneficiary of the yen 
appreciation said david gerstenhaber a senior economist with 
morgan stanley international in tokyo american exports to japan 
is clearly outstripping its imports from japan and the trend is 
very unlikely to change 
analysts see the decline in japans surplus and its increase in 
imports as the beginning of a long trend 
the figures for the first six months confirmed that japan is 
streadily heading the way to becoming an importing country said 
josen takahashi a chief analyst at mitsubishi research institute 
a tokyo think tank 
imports are growing at much faster pace than we expected it 
seems like a matter of time until japans account marks a 
deficit he said

coleco industries inc which soared 
to the top of the toy industry in the mid1980s with its cabbage 
patch kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls popularity 
waned announced today it filed for protection from its creditors 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law 
coleco said the filing which did not include its canadian and 
other foreign subsidiaries was made monday evening in the us 
bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
the toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its 
shortterm bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an 
adequate working capital credit line 
coleco also announced that morton e handel who is recovering 
from recent openheart surgery has submitted his resignation as 
chief executive officer citing the companys need for a fulltime 
ceo during this period he will continue as chairman of the company 
the board of directors appointed j brian clarke currently 
president and chief operating officer as president and chief 
executive officer 
the bankruptcy filing had been expected after coleco was unable 
to persuade its bondholders to agree to a 335 million debt 
restructuring the company lost 474 million in the quarter that 
ended april 2 and has suffered losses in four of the past five 
years including 215 over the last two years 
coleco owes more than 100 million to a group of foreign and 
domestic lenders 
in recent weeks the company has tried to raise cash by selling 
off some of its product lines on monday hasbro inc the nations 
largest toymaker said it had agreed to purchase some of colecos 
assets and lines for 21 million including the plastic wading and 
splashing pools and childrens outdoor furniture lines 
those lines which helped launched coleco in the toy business in 
1956 had sales last year of 77 million 
coleco also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut 
costs it currently has fewer than 600 employees in the united 
states down from an average of 2500 last year 
besides cabbage patch kids coleco manufactures alf dolls big 
wheels plastic tricycles and board games such as scrabble 
industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the 
nations toy market 
analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped 
coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on cabbage patch kids in 
1983 helped bring on its troubles 
the dolls introduced in 1983 after a number of other toy 
companies rejected the product helped coleco end 1985 in its 
strongest financial condition ever with sales of 776 million and 
record earnings of 64 million 
but the cabbage patch fad abated and analysts said the company 
did not pare its costs soon enough when the toy industry suffered 
a slump in 1987 the company was hit particularly hard 
coleco has faced tough times before it entered the snowmobile 
business in 1972 but snowfalls were light for the next three 
years the economy was depressed and losses were heavy 
the company posted a 22 million loss in 1978 threatening its 
survival in 1980 the securities and exchange commission charged 
coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles 
in 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the 
introduction of its colecovision home video game system the 
company saw its future in electronics and in 1983 unveiled its 
600 adam home computer 
adam was a monumental flop while sales of colecovision cooled 
the company lost 798 million in 1984 despite 540 million in 
sales of cabbage patch kids

the number of americans changing residences 
dipped after the 198485 burst of home sales triggered by falling 
interest rates the census bureau says 
some 3 million fewer americans moved between 198586 than in the 
previous year with virtually all of the drop occuring in the 
category of moves within the same county according to the 
geographical mobility report released tuesday by the bureau 
lower interest rates unleashed a pentup demand for new homes in 
the 198485 year spurring the mobility rate to 202 percent 
highest in this decade said kristin a hansen an analyst in the 
bureaus population division 
but in 198586 the rate of movement slipped back to 186 
percent a decline but still the second highest rate in the 1980s 
she said 
the figures are the most recent detailed statistics on mobility 
available however data collected by the departments of commerce 
and housing and urban development indicate that continued low 
interest rates helped spur strong sales of both new and existing 
homes last year 
mobility rates fell to alltime lows early in this decade ms 
hansen said as people postponed their quests for better homes 
because of high interest rates 
the mobility low of 166 percent of americans age 1 and over was 
achieved in 198283 census figures show the level was about 20 
percent throughout the 1950s and 1960s 
mobility statistics were first recorded in 1948 when it was 
found that 199 percent of americans had moved in the previous year 
in the 1970s ms hansen explained rates of moving declined 
because of the decline in the size of families people no longer 
needed to seek larger homes to accommodate more people she 
commented 
also there was a slight increase in homeownership in that 
period and owners are less likely to relocate than renters 
in the 198586 year the main change was in the number of 
residents who oved within the same county 131 percent compared to 
113 percent a year earlier 
local reasons for moving are usually housingrelated or 
changes in life cycles she said such as children moving to their 
own homes getting married and so forth 
regionally the northeast continued to lose people to other 
regions with a net loss of 250000 movers while the west 
continued to gain receiving about 200000 
the midwest reversed its recent pattern of loss however 
gaining about 15000 interstate movers in the year while the 
influx to the south was down to only 35000 new residents 
ms hansen speculated that this is a result of the recent 
problems in the energy industry in such southern states as texas 
and louisiana which are no longer attracting workers from the 
midwest indeed many who moved there to work in oil fields may be 
heading back home she said 
by age the rate of movement is highest among young adults and 
declines with age ms hansen observed and by race blacks tend to 
move more than whites 
while many factors are at work mobility generally declines as 
income increases those with less money are more likely to be 
renters while higher income people tend to own homes and may be 
tied to an area by business and professional relationships 
here is a rundown of the overall share of americans aged 1 and 
over who moved over oneyear periods

a year ago the british massmarket jeweler 
ratners group plc spent about 200 million to acquire an ohiobased 
jewelry company 
the experience was so positive the transaction so simple and 
the rewards potentially so great that ratners since has snapped up 
two more us companies 
ratners embodies a veritable 10year tradition among the 
british who are the most prolific acquirers of us businesses 
followed by the canadians west germans french and japanese 
those expecting to see a slowdown tied to the dollars recent 
resurgence in foreignexchange trading may be disappointed like a 
tycoon buying a fine diamond for his mistress corporate suitors 
from abroad still act as if money is no object at least not now 
last year foreigners spent 404 billion on us acquisitions 
in the first six months of this year the tally registered 21 
billion by some estimates 
those involved in the deals from investment bankers to the 
purchasers themselves say the status of the us currency is of 
little consequence as long as it doesnt really skyrocket 
its a commercial strategy not the exchange rate thats going 
to influence us said andrew coppel ratners group finance 
director from his london office 
since its long decline bottomed out recently the dollars value 
has risen as much as 10 percent against some major currencies most 
foreign companies with us operations are active participants in 
the currency markets buying and selling dollars as a hedge against 
swings in the exchange rate 
wt grimm amp co a chicagobased firm that tracks mergers and 
acquisitions noted that foreigners often end up paying even more 
for us companies than american acquirers 
while grimm attributed that to their aggressive entry into the 
us market investment bankers look to more practical 
considerations for one thing youve got a lengthier process of 
negotiating a contract simply because you must bring all your 
troops from your home country and theyre not familiar with the 
process said les fabuss a senior vice president at shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
in addition foreigners often do not initiate their own 
exclusive transactions 
its hard for them to say i want company x and go out and 
try to get it they tend to appear in auction situations where the 
highest price wins and currency allows them to pay slightly 
more he added 
last year foreign buyers announced 220 takeover deals 
accounting for 11 percent of all the mergers and acquisitions in 
the united states grimm reported 
nearly half of those deals carried price tags of 100 million or 
more with the average price of a us company totaling a record 
3154 millionmost of the takeovers occurred in the retail 
chemicals and industrial equipment and machinery categories 
among the billiondollar deals so far this year are the british 
construction company beazer plcs purchase of koppers inc and 
canadian investor robert campeaus acquisition of federated 
department stores inc 
currently under way is the sale of at least a dozen units of the 
singer co to help finance florida investor paul bilzerians 
purchase of the machinery and defense company a number of 
foreigners are bidding on those operations 
despite their willingness to pay top dollar for us properties 
foreigners are still finding some relative bargains here the labor 
department said american factories outperformed their rivals 
overseas last year in reducing labor costs and making their goods 
more competitive on world markets 
measured in devalued american dollars labor costs in the united 
states declined 15 percent in 1987 compared with increases of 75 
percent in south korea 77 percent in canada 135 pzss an economist 
with data resources inc of 
lexington mass 
finding an american mate takes some looking coppel said ratners 
began assessing the us market in september 1986 and quickly 
realized the enormous potential of the 20 billionayear 
jewelry market 
with the help of painewebber inc ratners zeroed in on sterling 
inc headquartered in akron ohio the deal closed less than a 
year later 
of particular interest to ratners was sterlings diamond 
expertise savvy in buying raw gemstones in tel aviv bombay and 
the netherlands sterling has shown ratners how to cut costs so 
much that coppel predicted the companys diamond business would 
jump from 12 percent to 20 percent of total sales 
since then weve been able to acquire two other companies at a 
much more favorable exchange rate coppel said referring to 
the privately held jewelers osterman inc of toledo and westhall 
inc in akron 
george c lodge a professor at harvard universitys business 
school said that the type of company helps determine the price 
foreigners are willing to pay 
if youre coming here to acquire the latest american 
technology in genesplitting the dollar rate is not as important 
because intellectual assets are harder to value he said on the 
other hand if you are coming here to set up an auto factory then 
the exchange rate becomes more important 
political pressure has kept the technologically aggressive 
japanese from bidding on american hightech companies but politics 
may also be contributing to the foreign merger wave 
as the politics of trade become more intense japanese and 
european companies regard a holding in the us as a protector of 
their access to our marketplace lodge said 
as the flow of business across the oceans increases investment 
banking companies have responded by paying more attention to 
courting overseas clients over the past year shearson has opened 
fullservice offices in west germany and france rather than 
relying on small branches 
merrill lynch amp co is looking east for growth employment in 
the companys tokyo office has jumped to 400 from 290 less than two 
years ago in addition the company has established a japan 
group in new york to facilitate transactions between us and 
japanese businesses a spokesman said 
at chase manhattan bank a new unit was established in april 
specifically to work on foreign direct investment in the united 
states the operations 20member staff currently has several 
major deals in the works said bank spokesman ken mills 
while foreigners are reveling in all the dollars their 
currencies can buy some of the americans doing business with them 
arent so happy one investment banker on a recent business trip in 
paris complained that his 435anight room at the elegant hotel le 
crillon was a mere broom closet 
lamenting how few francs his dollar buys he said why is it 
california chardonnays now make sense

the next administration should push for new 
gains in energy efficiency and without sacrifice for conscientious 
consumers an advocacy group said tuesday 
such a goal should incorporate an auto fueleconomy requirement 
of 45 miles per gallon a 50centpergallon gasoline tax increase 
and a high gasguzzler tax to be rebated to buyers of fuel 
efficient cars said the american council for an energyefficient 
economy 
the report produced by a panel of environmentalists academics 
and business executives argued that abundant opportunities for 
efficiency gains are the best way to counter several threats at 
once acid rain excessive dependence on imported oil 
international competition and the greenhouse warming of the 
earth by manmade gases notably the carbon dioxide produced by 
burning fossil fuels 
also tuesday a related report was issued by the safe energy 
communications council an advocacy group supported by several 
environmental organizations and others arguing that nuclear power 
has had virtually no effect in holding down oil use and cannot 
have any substantial impact in the foreseeable future 
the communications council also argued for a 45 mpg fueleconomy 
standard to be raised to 60 mpg in the year 2008 
unlike many reports advocating the pursuit of efficiency the 
study by the american council for an energyefficient economy 
explicitly argued that efficiency should be pursued only as long as 
its costeffective with environmental and balanceoftrade costs 
taken into account 
some of the authors told a news conference that point is a long 
way away 
the opportunities are proliferating the marketing folks 
havent been able to keep up with the engineers said howard 
geller associate director of the council 
asked which party was more likely to be receptive to the 
recommendations geller said we would hope any administration 
would accept this agenda and push it forward 
its been a great disaster that conservation has been 
associated with sitting in the dark said another author robert 
socolow director of the center for energy and environmental 
studies at princeton university 
the report listed 10 improvements it considered still possible 
the largest being transmissions with continuously variable gear 
ratios estimated to improve efficiency by 12 percent the second 
best improvement at 8 percent would be engines with four valves 
per cylinder that design already has been incorporated in several 
models in the past two or three years 
cars currently must get 26 mpg and buyers will not demand 
mileage above about 30 mpg because annual savings are small the 
authors said the higher standards could mean cars would cost 200 
to 800 more initially but this would be recovered over the 
lifetime of the car in reductions in operating costs they said 
a 50cent tax would make sure consumers are given a price 
signal that better reflects the real cost of the resource and 
encourages conservation and some of the 40 billion to 60 
billion raised each year could be returned to the poor through 
income tax provisions 
the tax should be imposed in increments of 10 cents per year for 
five years the report said if oil prices double the tax should 
be held to 30 cents if fuel efficiency gains are disappointing 
the tax could climb higher 
the gasguzzler tax which currently can exceed 2000 for 
certain luxury cars should be broadened to raise funds for 
rebates perhaps 1000 on fuelefficent cars the report said 
the rebates could apply to models 50 percent better than todays 
best the report said this would imply payments for cars getting 
about 75 mpg

americans attitudes toward illegal drug use 
have grown more antagonistic over the past year according to a 
study released tuesday by a volunteer group that has been trying to 
deglamorize drug abuse with a public service advertising campaign 
the group which calls itself the mediaadvertising partnership 
for a drugfree america says the nations media outlets donated 
more than 150 million in free space and time for the barrage of 
ads it made available in the first year of the antidrug campaign 
the campaign was launched in march 1987 
the amount of donated space fell short of the 500 million that 
the group had set as its target for each year of the threeyear 
campaign but campaign organizers said they were pleased with the 
results nonetheless and hope media outlets will find significantly 
more space and time for the ads this year 
the television ads broke into the top 10 with consumers surveyed 
by the independent video storyboard tests inc last year the first 
time a public service campaign appeared in that list in the 10 
years it has been compiled 
one of the more popular ads that the mediaadvertising 
partnership created is a television commercial that shows a man 
breaking an egg scrambling it and frying it saying that is what 
happens to your brain when you take drugs 
in addition to making 32 television ads 25 radio commercials 
and 80 print ads the group had a benchmark survey of attitudes 
toward illegal drug use done in februarymarch 1987 and followed 
that up in the same period this year to see if those attitudes had 
changed 
the research firm gordon s black corp of rochester ny said 
more than 4650 people across the country completed questionnaires 
for each survey 
the latest study said the change in attitude was most pronounced 
among college students which had been among the first groups in 
the 1960s to increase consumption of illegal drugs but is now 
showing a greater fear of the consequences of drug abuse 
even more impressive is the first evidence of a decline in 
occasional cocaine use the study said 
occasional cocaine use among college students has dropped to 6 
percent from 11 percent a year earlier it said while occasional 
usage by friends had dropped to 31 percent from 36 percent 
the survey said teenagers displayed the fewest changes in 
attitude although they generally took a dimmer view of drug use 
and the drug user than they had a year earlier 
the changes among children aged 912 and adults over age 18 
showed improvement but fell in between those for college students 
and teens it said 
on a more disconcerting note the study said it found 18 percent 
of the children surveyed said they had been approached to buy or 
use drugs up from 16 percent a year earlier 
it also said parents appear to have become more unrealistic 
about their own childrens behavior 
fortyone percent of parents surveyed said it was either 
certainly or probably untrue that my children are likely to try 
drugs sometime up from 36 percent a year earlier 
but that result appeared to be at odds the study said with 
other findings that includes 76 percent of the 16 and 17yearolds 
surveyed saying they had friends who use marijuana occasionally 
the survey said there was evidence that the groups advertising 
played a major role in changing attitudes 
black said it identified 10 markets that used the most antidrug 
advertising and said people living in those areas show a far 
larger shift in their attitudes toward drugs than in the balance of 
the united states

grain and soybean futures closed moderately 
higher tuesday on the chicago board of trade in cautious trading 
ahead of an eagerly awaited crop report 
overall by recent standards it was a fairly dull session 
said walter spilka a grain analyst in new york with smith barney 
harris upham amp co 
the rally was basically a technical rebound after three days of 
sharply lower prices spilka said 
he said gains probably were limited by edginess over the 
agriculture department crop report which was released after the 
close 
news that the reports revised production estimates for corn 
soybeans and spring wheat would be based on conditions as of 
tuesday instead of july 1 prompted a buying flurry early in the 
session spilka said 
in the report the agency estimated 1988 soybean production at 
165 billion bushels compared with a june estimate of 188 billion 
and 1987 production of 19 billion bushels 
this years corn harvest was estimated at 52 billion bushels 
compared with the june estimate of 73 billion and yearago 
production of 71 billion 
production of all us wheat this year was estimated at 184 
billion bushels compared with the june estimate of 212 billion 
and 1987 production of 21 billion 
at the close wheat was 9 cents to 12 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 379 a bushel corn was 12 cents 
to 17 cents higher with july at 305 a bushel oats were 1 
cents to 18 cents higher with july at 284 a bushel soybeans were 
10 cents to 26 cents higher with july at 884 a bushel

merrill lynch amp co on tuesday said lower 
financial activity contributed to a 36 percent drop in its 
secondquarter profit 
merrill lynch one of the nations largest investment houses 
said net income totaled 535 million or 47 cents a share in the 
second quarter compared with earnings of 833 million or 75 
cents a share a year ago 
revenue during the quarter rose 8 percent to 25 billion from 
23 billion in the second quarter of 1987 
william schreyer chairman and chief executive officer said the 
results were reasonable considering the difficult business 
environment experienced during the quarter 
he said the period was marked by a relatively lower level of 
activity in the financial markets 
commission revenues in the second quarter declined 35 percent to 
393 million due to reduced stock market activity the company 
said in a statement 
investment banking revenue also declined down 13 percent to 
256 million reflecting a lower level of mergers and acqusitions 
closings 
but record fixedincome activity drove principal transaction 
revenue to 388 million compared with a loss of 133 million a 
year ago 
insurance revenues of 85 million and asset management and 
custodial fee revenues of 122 million were little changed from the 
previous year

eastern airlines management was unimpressed with a 
fouryear contract offer from its pilots who claim they are 
offering 515 million a year in cost savings to the airline an 
eastern spokesman said tuesday 
the arithmetic they the pilots used totally distorts the 
proposal eastern spokesman robin matell said the main point 
is theyve hit us with a proposal that would increase our costs 
he said easterns calculations have found that the pilots 
proposal would increase the airlines costs by 116 million 
annually matell added that overall cumulative increases in the 
pilots offer would raise easterns costs by 33 percent 
the pilots contended that the 5 percent increases in pay along 
with stock they are requesting would be more than offset by 
moneysaving concessions in productivity rules and vacations 
it would give eastern some form of economic relief and at 
the same time protect our pilots said spokesman jb stokes of 
the air line pilots association local representing about 3500 
eastern pilots we think its very fair 
eastern losing an estimated 1 million daily has said it must 
have wage and workrule concessions from its three unions to cut 
labor costs by around 30 percent overall the pilots current 
contract became amendable this month 
eastern has been in federal mediation with its largest union 
the 12000member machinists for nearly seven months 
the pilots proposal was designed to halt a downsizing of 
eastern thats seen a steady reduction in the number of flights 
the pilots estimate that by summers end nearly 1000 eastern 
pilots will have left the airline since the 1986 takeover by giant 
texas air corp many because of tense labormanagement relations 
and uncertainty about the carriers future 
the pilots proposal would include a fence agreement keeping 
eastern separate from continental airlines a nonunion carrier also 
owned by houstonbased texas air eastern unions say texas air 
wants to strip eastern of its assets 
the pilots offer also calls for three 5 percent pay increases 
and one 3 percent raise plus shares in texas air stock over the 
life of the proposed fouryear contract 
one of the most critical proposals involves payment of an 
unspecified amount of money to pilots who have yet to take a 
vacation this year the pilots said pilots would receive five days 
of vacation and be compensated for the rest those pilots who have 
taken a vacation this year would receive an unspecified amount of 
cash for any remaining vacation time due them 
this proposal alone would save eastern 11 million according to 
alpa 
but matell said it would be cheaper to hire new pilots 
the pilot shortage thing is a myth we have enough pilots to 
fly the schedule we intend to operate matell said 
under the present contract a pilot can fly 84 hours per month 
under the proposal that would rise to 88 hours and go as high as 
90 hours under a socalled buffer provision 
that provision according to alpa would save the airline 
another 95 millon annually but matell said the pilots want 
timeandahalf for the extra hours 
a third element that would make more efficient use of the pilots 
would save the company another 31 million yearly alpa said 
matell said eastern calculated the savings at only 67 million 
stokes after hearing of matells remarks said alpa stands by 
its calculations 
thats certainly not the way it prints out stokes said of 
easterns figures 
we felt and still do that its a very positive approach that 
would save the company some money stokes said adding that the 
pilots other priorities include maintaining eastern as a large 
separate airline 
he said eastern management hasnt presented its own offer 
they have not made a formal proposal as yet thats just 
delaying the negotiations said stokes

stock prices fell today as investors showed 
concern over interest rates and the trade deficit 
stock market investors have dwelled lately on the possibility 
that the federal reserve will push up interest rates as a way to 
cool the economy and stave off inflation 
concerns about rising interest rates have dampened the stock 
market because more attractive yields on bonds could siphon money 
away from stocks also high rates could hurt stock prices by 
slowing economic growth 
a rise in agricultural commodity prices raised inflation fears 
which hurt the bond market analysts said 
this is a market thats backpedaling said alan ackerman 
an investment strategist for gruntal amp co anxiety over higher 
interest rates is keeping players on the sidelines as well as 
stalling some of the summer sizzle that appears to lie ahead 
traders also appeared cautious in advance of fridays release of 
figures on the may merchandise trade deficit

canadian dollar

which rose to recent highs against several major currencies on

the dollars slow measured decline began early in tokyo and

the nations may trade deficit which is due out friday 
the consensus is that the may report will register about 11 
billion up from the 99 billion deficit reported for april which 
was the lowest imbalance in three years 
in the past the dollar has plunged in response to an unexpected 
widening of the trade gap and soared when it narrowed 
but craig sloane a currency analyst at smith barney harris 
upham amp co noted that the trade numbers were more of an obsession 
earlier in the year 
the dollar has made big moves without the trade numbers and 
the trend to a much stronger dollar has become much more visible in 
the last few months he said 
sloane said the dollar might be influenced by comments by 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who is scheduled to 
testify before the senate banking committee on monetary policy

grain and soybean futures prices moved moderately higher tuesday 
on the chicago board of trade in cautious dealings ahead of the 
agriculture departments eagerly awaited monthly crop report 
analysts said the report released after trading ended and 
forecasting a 24 percent decline in overall us grain production 
should send prices higher when trading resumes on wednesday 
but they say weather forecasts will continue to dominate the 
markets 
on other markets livestock and meat futures were mixed energy 
futures were mixed precious metals were higher and stockindex 
futures retreated 
grain analysts called the crop report bullish for soybean 
prices bearish for corn and slightly bearish for wheat but the 
anticipated strength in soybeans was expected to offset the 
weakness in the grains ultimately pulling all the grain markets 
higher wednesday at least for a few minutes 
after about three minutes of trading theyll have worked off 
their report anxiety and well be looking at fridays saturdays 
and sundays weather which we see as hot hot hot said walter 
spilka a grain analyst in new york with smith barney harris upham 
amp co 
i dont think the markets going to dwell on this report too 
long agreed joel karlin chief research analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
based on conditions as of tuesday the usda predicted a 27 
percent drop in corn production from 1987 a 14 percent drop in 
soybean production and a wheat crop 13 percent smaller than that 
harvested last year 
the corn harvest was estimated at 52 billion bushels compared 
with the june estimate of 73 billion and yearago production of 
706 billion 
the usda estimated 1988 soybean production at 165 billion 
bushels compared with a june estimate of 188 billion and 1987 
production of 19 billion bushels 
production of all us wheat was projected at 184 billion 
bushels compared with the june estimate of 212 billion and 1987 
production of 21 billion 
analysts called the corn and wheat estimates conservative 
this just confirms everybodys opinion that theres some crop 
damage out there and the usda is looking at a bit more of a 
problem in soybeans than the trade had anticipated spilka said 
this years planted soybean acreage estimated by the usda at 
5852 million acres was about 700000 acres below market 
expectations planted corn acreage estimated at 6752 million 
acres was about 500000 acres more than expected 
grain and soybean futures advanced moderately ahead of the 
report which was issued after the markets closed 
wheat settled 8 cents to 13 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in july at 381 a bushel corn was 8 cents to 17 cents 
higher with july at 306 a bushel oats were 1 cents lower to 15 
cents higher with july at 279 a bushel soybeans were 7 cents to 
21 cents higher with july at 879 a bushel 
cattle futures finished mixed while some pork futures advanced 
their daily limits on the chicago mercantile exchange in reaction 
to the rise in feed grain prices said dale durchholz a 
porkmarket analyst with agrivisor services inc in bloomington 
ill 
traders expect livestock and meat prices to rise sharply next 
year after falling in the near term due to widespread producer 
selling of animals this summer because of the droughtdriven rise 
in feed prices he said 
the usda also reported the worst july 1 pasture conditions in 
history which should encourage further droughtpattern trading on 
the livestock markets said thomas morgan president of sterling 
analytical services inc in arlington heights ill 
live cattle settled 70 cent lower to 17 cent higher with 
august at 6582 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 60 
cent lower with august at 7572 cents a pound hogs were 20 cent 
to the limit 150 cents higher with july at 4567 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 40 cent to the limit 2 cents higher with 
july at 3310 cents a pound 
crude oil prices weakened in volatile trading on the new york 
mercantile exchange but unleaded gasoline strengthened because of 
tight supplies and speculation about higher us demand analysts 
said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 17 cents 
lower with august at 1472 a barrel heating oil was 15 cent to 
68 cent lower with august at 4065 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 06 cent lower to 135 cents higher with august at 
5348 cents a gallon 
precious metals futures posted modest gains on new yorks 
commodity exchange due to the inflationary implications of higher 
grain prices and a weaker dollar 
gold settled 2 to 230 higher with august at 43870 a troy 
ounce silver was 37 cents to 38 cents higher with july at 6974 
a troy ounce

voting record on labor issues of any of the running mates michael 
dukakis was considering according to an aflcio rating 
nevertheless union lobbyists on tuesday were quick to praise the 
democratic choice 
the texas democrat was hailed for his role in salvaging labors 
top legislative priority this year making companies give workers 
60 days advance notice before closing their plants or laying them 
off 
bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two 
plant closing notices and the trade bill were compatible said 
robert mcglotten the 141millionmember labor federations 
legislative director and he let his colleagues know how he 
felt 
the senate last week passed with a vetoproof 72vote majority 
legislation requiring companies to provide 60 days advance notice 
of plant closings or layoffs involving more than 50 people the 
house is expected to follow suit on wednesday 
labor leaders demanded enactment of the mandatory layoff notices 
as the price for maintaining their support for a massive 
overhauling of the nations trade laws that bentsen was a key 
player in crafting as chairman of the senate finance committee 
reagan vetoed the trade bill in may citing the layoff notices 
that were then a part of it as his primary reason 
james booe secretarytreasurer of the communications workers of 
america and a member of the democrats platformdrafting 
committee acknowledged that bentsen was not labors main spear 
carrier on the trade and plant closing issues 
but he didnt do a lot of the things that he could have done 
to mess us up and there were a lot of other people urging him 
to said booe i dont think you can call him a labor hero but 
hes been on our side more than hes been against us 
as a threeterm senator from a righttowork state where less 
than 12 percent of the workers belong to unions bentsen has always 
walked a fine line between conservative businessmen and labor 
activists in the democratic party 
despite a lifetime voting record of only 51 percent on labor 
issues according to the aflcios committee on political 
education texas labor leaders endorsed his reelection in 1982 
all of the five other members of congress who dukakis was 
considering as possible running mates have stronger cope voting 
records another southerner sen albert gore of tennessee had the 
highest 88 percent 
but bentsen was listed as voting right on eight of 10 issues 
in 1987 that the aflcio considered in compiling its rankings 
shoring up his support among labor leaders 
bentsens only wrong votes were on raising the threshold on 
government construction contracts for which unionscale wages must 
be paid and giving employers who hire illegal aliens extensions 
before fining them 
hes been all over the map said steve kerekes a spokesman 
for the national right to work committee a group that advocates 
state laws like the one in texas which outlaws labor contracts that 
require nonmembers to pay dues to unions that represent them 
earlier this year bentsen came out against a socalled 
doublebreasting bill that is the top priority of construction 
unions the bill would prohibit unionized companies from operating 
nonunion subsidiaries as a means of getting around wage and other 
provisions of labor contracts theyve signed 
but last month he voted against a measure to make violence on 
picket lines a federal crime a reversal of his vote two years ago 
favoring such legislation 
aflcio members hold 751 of the 4161 delegates at the 
democratic convention opening next week in atlanta combined with 
the national education associations 280 delegates about 
onefourth of total that will nominate dukakis and bentsen come 
from the labor movement 
obviously we would like to see somebody who had a 100 percent 
voting record said mcglotten but as you review things a cope 
record becomes less important than whether someones door is open 
to us and understands our problems he understands our problems

the steel industry faces a possible reduction 
in orders as the drought reduces harvests and cuts the demand for 
new farm equipment industry representatives said tuesday 
the drought also has increased operating costs by forcing 
steelmakers to contract for smaller lighter ore barge loads that 
can navigate shallower waters near the minnesota ore ranges 
steelmakers add however the drought likely will not harm the 
industrys recovery and the generally strong market for steel 
usx corps gary works produces tinplated steel among other 
products for the canning industry and inland steel corp which 
operates a facility in east chicago supplies steel to farm 
machinery manufacturers 
theres some talk that canners if the crops are lower will 
be canning less and that could have an effect on shipment said 
usx spokesman george kuebler harvest time is still down the road 
for a lot of crops yet so we dont see any impact 
an inland newsletter said the company anticipates some customers 
might cut back on orders if the drought continues 
farm equipment manufacturers in particular may be hurt by 
declining sales of tractors and combines the newsletter said 
inland spokesman george nekvasil said some companies that depend 
on river traffic stalled by droughtlowered waters may reduce steel 
orders if they cant move their own finished products to market 
kuebler said smaller ore loads increase shipping costs by about 
10 percent that has not yet translated into an increase in steel 
prices he said 
nevertheless orders for steel remain strong said nekvasil 
we continue to see business conditions strong he said i 
certainly wouldnt see anything that would threaten recovery or 
profitability theres a very strong market for steel today

lawmakers unveiled a wideranging relief bill 
for americas droughtstricken farmers tuesday promising payments 
of up to 100000 to keep them on the land despite the withering 
heat and lack of rain 
the legislation is expected to move quickly through congress 
the chairmen of both the house and senate agriculture committees 
vowed to move as rapidly as possible and agriculture secretary 
richard e lyng said that because of the extent of the drought the 
reagan administration will overlook minor flaws in the bill and 
support the measure 
this is the largest drought that our nation has ever 
experienced lyng declared as senators met to start committee 
action on the disaster legislation 
i think history will show that its truly more mammoth than 
any of us has ever experienced lyng said he said a recurrence 
next year would suggest that weve done something wrong and the 
gods are against us 
lawmakers did not give an estimate of the cost of the relief 
legislation but expressed their resolve not to allow drought to set 
off a rash of bankruptcies in the countryside just as the farm 
economy is shaking off the painful stagnation of the early 1980s 
were not going to allow their lives as farmers and ranchers 
to end because of a freak of nature senate agriculture committee 
chairman patrick j leahy dvt said 
both the senate and house agriculture committees opened hearings 
on the bill on tuesday 
the chairman of the house panel rep e kika de la garza 
dtexas said it would send the wrong signal to leave the job 
unfinished in august when lawmakers flee washingtons heat he 
added that he was hopeful the panel could dispense with any parade 
of witnesses from farm lobbies and instead act this week on any 
changes congressmen want to make in the draft bill 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan also called for quick 
action on the legislation because the american farmer needs 
help its that simple 
we must make certain that our relief package is targeted to 
those who need the help dole said in a statement there can be 
no windfalls for any individual or group we owe that much to the 
farmers and the taxpayers 
lyng was briefing house members on the long hot dry spell when 
aides arrived from the agriculture department five blocks away with 
a fresh forecast that the drought would cut this years corn output 
to around 52 billion bushels down from 706 billion last year 
under the proposed legislation disaster payments would be 
capped at 100000 for each individual farmer payments would 
represent 65 percent of predrought expected earnings whether from 
target prices pricesupport loans or market prices but they would 
apply only to losses in excess of 35 percent of the crop 
a 50 cent reduction per hundredweight in dairy price supports 
scheduled to start next year would be canceled under the 
legislation dairymen say such an action is warranted by 
skyrocketing feed costs although it was one of their prime goals 
long before the drought set in 
government emergency feed programs already in effect would be 
overhauled and made available to a broader range of farmers the 
drought has burned away a considerable amount of hay and thus put 
feed at a premium 
wheat feed grains cotton and rice producers would not be 
required to refund to the government any deficiency payments they 
have received in advance the incomesupport payments represent the 
difference between the market value of their harvest and its value 
at higher socalled target prices set by congress under the 1985 
farm program and adjusted annually by the secretary of agriculture 
market prices have climbed steadily closer to target prices in 
anticipation of a diminished harvest and thus the drought has 
reduced federal incomesupport payments as well the drying up of 
these subsidies at a time when farmers have fewer crops to take to 
market threatens to hurt some of them 
to complicate matters many farmers have received 40 percent of 
their deficiency payments from the department of agriculture in 
advance and will have to refund a portion of them unless rescued by 
relief legislation 
another key provision would help farmers convert from production 
of corn cotton and a variety of other crops to soybean production 
without paying certain financial penalties under the farm program 
the provision is being closely watched in the farm and segments 
of the financial communities because soybeans are expected to be in 
short supply as a result of the drought and prices already are 
soaring

for the first half of 1987 
firsthalf revenue rose to 498 billion from 374 billion a 
year earlier 
polzin said caterpillar achieved record sales and robust profit 
levels despite higher costs for materials such as steel and 
problems caused by a weakening of the us dollar overseas 
the worlds largest manufacturer of earthmoving equipment 
finished in the black for the fifth consecutive quarter and said it 
expects company sales for the year will substantially exceed 
sales in 1987 
caterpillar spokesman mark polzin said 1987 sales of 818 
billion represented the companys best performance since 1981 when 
it had record sales of 915 billion 
only three months ago the company said its sales would match 
the growth which occurred in 1987 
economic growth will be faster this year than assumed 
earlier polzin said and replacement demand will be stronger 
than expected 
polzin said caterpillar also is commanding higher prices than 
expected for its products and pleased with the acceptance of 
several recently introduced models 
caterpillar is rebuilding from a market collapse in 1981 which 
led to three years of losses that amounted to 950 million 
a general overcapacity in the industry and fierce competition at 
home and abroad combined during the early 1980s to hurt caterpillar 
the company has fought back to financial health with a 
costcutting program savings were made by closing plants and 
massive layoffs including slashing its peoriaarea workforce in 
half eliminating about 18000 positions

honesty and fairness will be in the curriculum at 
harvard business school starting this fall when all students 
entering the graduate school will be required to take a threeweek 
course in ethics 
after the wall street insider trading scandal broke in 1986 the 
nations business schools harvard included were criticized for 
not stressing ethics in their teachings of future business managers 
we want to send a signal early on that these issues are 
important to the organization thomas piper one of the 
professors who will teach the course at harvard said in tuesdays 
editions of the boston globe 
piper defined the teaching of ethics as instilling the values of 
respect honesty trust and fairness and said the key was to show 
that ethics are part of the decisionmaking process for managers 
the ungraded course will begin the second week of the term the 
school also plans to have more discussion of ethics in its regular 
courses and has hired research assistants to develop material 
workshops will be held for faculty members 
fewer than 10 percent of business schools require students to 
take ethics according to ethics specialist michael hoffman of 
bentley college 
last year harvard received 20 million from former securities 
and exchange commission chairman john shad for the teaching of 
ethics 
harvards critics including some faculty members had 
questioned the schools commitment to teaching ethics some critics 
suggested at the time of shads gift that harvard got interested in 
the subject only when it got the money 
the school countered that ethics already were taught in many of 
its regular courses and a separate course was not needed 
piper told the globe that after one year of study harvard 
decided on a dual approach a separate minicourse and more 
discussion of ethics in other courses 
he said ethics always had been taught at harvard but may have 
been squeezed out over time interest in doing more came before the 
wall street scandal he said but the scandal made people realize 
that the pendulum may have swung too far 
last year harvard university president derek bok told the globe 
he did not think professors at the business school are able to 
put ethics into their courses at the level they should 
there is a dangerous tendency on the part of some people to 
say that ethics is something we all know about bok said
