along florida waterways starting to resemble an 
aquatic interstate 95 a new kind of traffic is worrying the marine 
patrol water scooters sometimes piloted by children hardly old 
enough to ride a bicycle 
the model names ring with excitement kawasaki makes jet skis 
yamaha sells wave runners and progressive power corp offers the 
surf jet for example 
but the boats that resemble snowmobiles are increasingly a 
factor in some of floridas worst accidents and complaints about 
operators are growing 
the florida marine patrol seems to come in contact with an 
awful lot of people who are not safe and responsible who are not 
reasonable and prudent said patrol capt mike lamphear they 
have lost touch with reality 
a 9yearold boy died in march after his scooter dead in the 
water was hit by another of the 7footlong craft in biscayne bay 
off miami a 5yearold boy survived after his head and chest were 
slashed open by a boat that ran over his scooter in a lake north of 
miami also in march 
jb spence attorney for the family of the 9yearold victim 
accuses operators of terrorizing swimmers and other boaters and has 
a personal lawsuit pending against riders who frequent a canal by 
his house in the florida keys 
you see what theyre like theyre like bucking broncos they 
ride the wake they race said spence who likens the machines 
sound to the roar of a chainsaw theyre just absolutely so rude 
and arrogant that i sued them im going to take them into court 
and try to teach them some manners 
the two miami accidents have focused attention on the first 
statewide effort to regulate the lowriding vessels that are 
propelled by a concentrated jet of water riders sit or kneel on 
the machines depending on the model 
the six manufacturers of personal watercraft which generally 
cost 2500 to 4500 support the legislation by state sen tom 
mcpherson and view it as a national model to regulate the skis and 
their freewheeling operators 
the measure was approved unanimously in late april by the 
florida senate and was passed overwhelmingly by the house last 
friday 
quick to realize they could be at risk from government 
regulators the manufacturers the other three are wet jet 
international bombardier and ultranautics support mcphersons 
bill it sets an operator age limit of 14 for private vessels and 
16 for rentals banning reckless operation restricting operation 
to daylight hours requiring operators to wear floatation vests and 
a cutoff switch to stop the engine if the rider falls off 
violation a seconddegree misdemeanor would carry a 35 fine or 
60 days in jail 
weaving through congested traffic jumping wakes and playing 
chicken would be outlawed said maj denis grealish boating 
safety coordinator for the marine patrol none of our 
investigations have revealed any inherent safety problem or defects 
with the craft 
all of our problems have been caused by operator error when 
you look at these types of craft and the type of quick fast 
movement theyre capable of and the centrifugal forces operating 
against these people as theyre making turns you have to have a 
certain amount of strength coordination balance and judgment to 
operate these things 
the personal watercraft industry association representing the 
six manufacturers also is monitoring other efforts to regulate the 
craft such as an assortment of new hampshire bills that would ban 
the vessels on small lakes where residents have registered noise 
complaints 
the organization estimates that 150000 americans own the 
scooters 
most regulations are imposed locally for specific water bodies 
but the industry hopes to take the florida bill to texas next in 
its bid to spread the measure nationally said john dane 
government relations representative in washington for the national 
marine manufacturers association 
were hoping this bill serves as a national model dane said 
the problem in florida is compounded by burgeoning enthusiasm 
for boating roughly 680000 vessels including 10000 personal 
watercraft are registered to operate along floridas 1350 miles 
of coastline and 11000 miles of rivers creeks and streams 
grealish estimates another 200000 to 300000 boats operate in 
florida on a transient basis 
the state leads the nation in boating fatalities with 106 in 
1987 and 94 in 1988 six involved personal watercraft last year of 
the states 11 fatalities with personal watercraft only two 
involved minors most victims are men ranging from their late teens 
to mid 30s 
mcpherson has used the 1987 ban on manufacture of threewheel 
allterrain vehicles blamed for nearly 1000 deaths and 300000 
injuries in five years as a club in his bid to regulate personal 
watercraft 
manufacturers first were kind of resistant to any 
legislation he said but he noted in conversations with industry 
representatives that threewheelers went by the wayside because 
they didnt have regulations and the same thing could happen to 
jet skis

gen michel aoun sleeps with a pistol 
under his pillow and rarely leaves his bunker since his crusade to 
drive syria out of lebanon has made him the target of at least one 
assassination attempt 
aides say the stocky 54yearold maronite christian leader 
believes he tops syrias mostwanted list 
but aoun shows no sign of surrendering to the foes who outnumber 
his mainly christian forces 41 despite an inferno of syrian 
artillery and rocket fire in the last three months and a blockade 
of the beleaguered christian enclave the fighting has killed at 
least 360 people 
aides said aoun has left the command bunker at the presidential 
palace only once or twice since he proclaimed his war of 
liberation against syria and its moslem allies march 8 fueling 
the latest round of the 14year civil war 
the weekend arrests in cyprus of six lebanese only underlines 
aouns fears the six believed to belong to a syrianbacked group 
confessed they plotted to shoot down the christian leaders 
helicopter with missiles 
aoun holes up in a bunker under what used to be the palace 
parking lot 
the twostory ushaped palace perched on a pinewooded hilltop 
east of beirut has been a prime target of syrian gunners more 
than 3000 shells and rockets have hit the compound 
shrapnel from 240mm mortar rounds and 180mm howitzer shells are 
displayed on the broken stone steps at the main entrance 
the large windows have been shattered birds fly in and out of 
holes in the walls of the spacious banquet hall 
aoun who commands lebanons army and heads a christian cabinet 
vying for legitimacy with moslem rivals has no illusions that his 
20000 soldiers alone can drive out the 40000 syria troops in 
lebanon 
his strategy has been to force the world to notice lebanons 
plight which he believes has been ignored 
for the first time there is a real awareness of the lebanese 
problem aoun said in an interview in his bunker 
where was our cause three months ago it was dead we have 
brought it back to life he said 
three flights of browncarpeted stairs go down to a small 
concrete hall with three corridors leading to cramped living 
quarters and a spartan office it holds two wooden desks a few 
leather chairs and two telephones a lebanese flag adorns one wall 
aouns family lived with him there until a fragile ceasefire 
may 11 which the syrians violate daily while christian guns remain 
silent 
we as a family are used to rough living aoun said many 
of the palace staff couldnt get here because of the shelling so 
my daughters helped me mireille for example worked on the 
computer 
he sent his wife nadia and their three daughters to the family 
home in rabiyeh in mountains northeast of beirut when the arab 
league called the ceasefire 
i didnt feel they were afraid when they were with me on the 
contrary i felt i had soldiers with me we ate with the 
soldiers he said 
but the general always has a pistol under his pillow 
according to an aide 
he said aoun exercises every morning when he wakes up at 6 am 
before an 18hour work day and he looked relaxed and fit despite 
the constant tension he eats simply rice beans potatoes and an 
occasional steak 
his crusade and the destruction it has triggered has bred 
extreme passions among the 1 million christians besieged in their 
310squaremile heartland 
critics who believe aouns lopsided war will destroy beirut 
call him napolaoun because of what they consider delusions of 
grandeur and recklessness matching those of the french military 
leader and selfproclaimed emperor napoleon bonaparte 
others hail aoun as a hero the first lebanese leader who dare 
stand up to syrian domination 
hes our savior said housewife mary keyrouz hes our 
jesus may god protect him

mikhail s gorbachevs performance in the new 
soviet parliament has shown him to be a consummate politician who 
relishes conflict and control 
ever since he stepped into the international spotlight in london 
in december 1984 gorbachev has proved a master at showing 
different faces to different audiences 
he startled skeptical soviet citizens weary of 70 years of 
communist party rule with his ability to take politics into their 
streets months after assuming control of the traditionally 
secretive kremlin 
his smiles and quips and his fashionable wife won admiration and 
interest abroad even before his rapid makeover of foreign policy 
shot him ahead of domestic leaders in western opinion polls 
at the congress of peoples deputies he has played different 
roles the strict teacher in his school of democracy the 
genial leader meeting deputies from the provinces and the 
diplomat brokering deals between bitterly divided ethnic groups 
many soviets glued to live radio and tv broadcasts of the 
proceedings are less enthusiastic about gorbachev now than they 
were two years ago grumbling bitterly about the increasing 
consumer shortages his reforms have brought 
but there is virtually universal agreement that gorbachev is 
cunning 
the 58yearold gorbachevs political skill has guided him 
through several potential pitfalls in the four years since he took 
power and swiftly pledged to restructure soviet society 
he hit a snag in the fall of 1987 when an outspoken proponent 
of his reforms boris n yeltsin overstepped the bounds of party 
propriety yeltsin gorbachevs handpicked moscow party chief 
criticized the slow pace of reform and named the man he thought was 
to blame fellow politburo member yegor k ligachev 
gorbachev indirectly voicing bitter disappointment with 
yeltsin joined with ligachev in removing yeltsin from the 
politburo and the influential moscow party post 
but yeltsin was allowed to stay at the center of power in the 
capital he was appointed first deputy construction minister 
from that base he has made a remarkable political comeback 
winning more than 5 million votes from muscovites to get a seat in 
the congress 
gorbachev called the new congress into being last summer at a 
key conference at which he cleverly won communist party support to 
reform the political structure 
through the congress as well as the supreme soviet its 
standing legislature and a new system of legislative oversight 
outlined tuesday gorbachev can now if he chooses create a 
structure that would sidestep the party apparatus and central 
bureaucracy he says have watered down and blocked his reforms 
and through a deft political maneuver monday gorbachev has 
yeltsin in the new legislature which contains only one politburo 
member vitaly i vorotnikov and excludes ligachev 
mindful of the danger of antagonizing conservatives gorbachev 
is careful not to go too far too fast with his reforms 
this has led the volatile emotional intellectuals that are his 
key source of popular support to doubt whether their president 
actually wants the kind of radical reform advocated by yeltsin who 
called wednesday for the congress to wrest power from the 20 
millionmember party 
doubts about potentially authoritarian tendencies in the soviet 
leader who now heads the party and state apparatus have been 
fueled by some of his statements to the congress 
lauding the democracy brought to life in parliamentary debate 
tuesday gorbachev added but this does not mean that gorbachev 
does not see i see everything 
last week during a televised questioning as the congress 
debated his suitability as president gorbachev stressed his 
control of the country 
i know that at the back of moscow buses there are pictures of 
brezhnev covered with medals and gorbachev covered with ration 
cards he remarked referring to cartoons mocking leonid i 
brezhnevs vainglorious love of awards and the rationing that 
current shortages have brought 
some intellectuals also voiced concern with gorbachevs 
virtually undebated pronouncement tuesday that elections for 
republican and local parliaments have been postponed from this fall 
to next spring 
gorbachev argued that time was needed to iron out difficulties 
in electoral laws that emerged from the contested campaign for the 
congress 
but his move could be a sop to regional party leaders who 
complained at a central committee meeting in april about elections 
the month before to the congress in which several party chiefs went 
down to defeat 
whatever gorbachevs conservative tendencies the congress has 
confirmed his zest and physical stamina for debate 
guiding the congress through discussions that swing from dull 
procedure to crackling exchanges he displays an excellent memory 
for names and faces when not chairing the sessions he whispers to 
the presiding officers and intervenes to cut off or encourage 
discussion 
he also has an ability to forge compromise when conflict 
threatened to turn one discussion into a shouting match gorbachev 
urged lets live as friends

writer ales adamovich says the freedom to question 
authority at the congress of peoples deputies parliament is like a 
polevault or highjump contest 
each day the level goes higher everyone knows theres an upper 
limit but no one knows where it is 
there is no prohibition just an ability to jump higher 
the writer observed after wednesdays session but you can fall 
and break your nose 
the session started may 25 with firm but polite questioning of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs privileges powers and his right 
to be both communist party chief and head of state 
on tuesday a former olympic weightlifter pointedly accused 
gorbachev of holding back information on the military assault on 
demonstrators in tbilisi georgia that killed 19 and he attacked 
the feared kgb secret police 
in no circumstances is it possible to accept that the head of 
state doesnt know the circumstances of the case said yuri 
vlasov in reference to the georgian violence otherwise what 
kind of head of state is he 
vlasov urged the parliament to add an impeachment article to the 
soviet constitution to be imposed for withholding information from 
the people 
then he attacked the kgb which he said is the most closed 
the most conspiratorial of all government institutions 
controlling the lives of its citizens and set above every other 
part of the government 
he received prolonged applause 
with his policy of glasnost or greater openness gorbachev has 
awakened open political debate in society but the speed at which 
soviets have taken in the changes has startled even some of the 
deputies 
gorbachev sought to reassure them the giveandtake of 
parliamentary debate is a normal part of a more democratic system 
even if deputies occasionally lose their tempers 
the deputies whose performances were broadcast back home on tv 
took the opportunity to talk about their constituents pet peeves 
boris n yeltsin criticized gorbachev on wednesday in what 
amounted to an alternate policy address 
the communist maverick told reporters his speech would have been 
impossible three years ago but may have been acceptable a year or 
year and a half ago 
adamovich a political reformer famous for his tales of world 
war ii horrors in byelorussia said the 2250 deputies had become 
more aggressive in their speeches and criticism 
the rhetoric peaked last saturday in a pitched battle between 
reformers and conservatives over the makeup of the working 
legislature the supreme soviet historian yuri afanasyev said the 
reformers were being oppressed by an aggressively obedient 
majority 
adamovich said he noticed from the congress floor that the 
rhetoric peaked again tuesday in a sharp debate that included the 
military commander of the tbilisi assault the former communist 
party chief and a member of a commission that called the assault a 
planned mass massacre 
lt col igor rodionov the military commander said the 
protesters were expressing separatist slogans and insulting 
russians and other nongeorgians 
commission member thomas gamkrelidze said in an interview 
wednesday that although debate in the congress is freer the 
tbilisi assault demonstrated that level of openness has not reached 
the entire country 
i think rodionovs speech here has shown the whole world that 
it is enough to raise slogans here to be punished or killed he 
said 
our democracy has not reached the point to realize that it is 
not permissible to punish people for slogans gorbachev seems to be 
more liberal in this respect than others including the military

dr charles anthony hufnagel a cardiac 
surgeon who pioneered the artificial heart valve died on wednesday 
at sibley memorial hospital he was 72 
hufnagel implanted the first artificial heart valve in a human 
patient at georgetown university medical school in 1952 
in 1947 he also participated in the first human kidney 
transplant at bostons peter bent brigham hospital 
the heart valve developed by hufnagel involved the insertion of 
a plastic valve into a damaged artery a plastic ball forced the 
valve to open and close permitting blood to flow into and out of 
the heart as it would through a normal artery 
since then artificial heart valves have changed but hufnagels 
design and procedure were considered major medical milestones 
from 1969 to 1979 hufnagel was chairman of the surgery 
department at georgetowns medical school 
at his death he was a professor of surgery at the uniformed

with nearly 1 million in scholarship 
offers chris vuturo had the luxury of choice when it came time to 
pick a college 
valedictorian civic volunteer newspaper columnist athlete 
vuturo had a perfect 40 gradepoint average at de sales high 
school he scored 33 out of a possible 36 on the american college 
test and a combined 1350 out of a possible 1600 on the scholastic 
aptitude test 
he was always thinking ahead of us teachers as well as 
students said tony medley who was vuturos journalism teacher 
he applied to numerous colleges and received scholarships and 
invitations to attend harvard university the university of 
southern california the us air force academy massachusetts 
institute of technology columbia university boston university 
and georgetown university among others 
all told he said he was offered 885782 worth of 
scholarships based on current tuition rates 
he had dreamed about aeronautical engineering since childhood 
then he started working for the student newspaper and thought about 
pursuing a career in journalism lately hes been thinking about a 
combination of genetics and law 
vuturo decided on harvard thinking it would give him room to 
explore some or all those fields the scholarship package from 
harvard is worth about 68000 over four years and that plus some 
of his own savings would cover about threequarters of the cost 
the rest will come from other scholarships including a national 
merit scholarship and a jefferson county farm bureau scholarship 
teachers and students describe vuturo as a ferocious competitor 
in the classroom but they also said hes among the first to 
volunteer to tutor other students 
i always saw his presence in the class as a positive catalyst 
to other students said richard knoop who taught him biology and 
german 
vuturo is the youngest of six children of salvador and jean 
vuturo the vuturos said chris who received a partial scholarship 
to attend the roman catholic high school couldnt have gone to

two nicaraguan diplomats who arrived here just 
10 days ago were ordered home by the state department on wednesday 
in retaliation for the expulsion of two american envoys from 
managua last week 
at the same time the department expressed interest in improving 
bilateral relations and said it would respond positively to 
concrete steps the sandinista government may take toward democracy 
the nicaraguan embassy was informed that roberto vargas and 
william vigil both minister counselors were given 72 hours to 
leave us territory state department deputy spokesman richard 
boucher said 
in managua president daniel ortega promised a hard hand for 
foreigners he believes are meddling in his countrys internal 
affairs 
the us government should be clear that we will not let them 
be here if they show disrepect for the country ortega said at a 
meeting of some 1200 teachers representing educators nationwide 
who are seeking a salary incrase 
ortegas statements were made in response to the expulsions in 
washington 
ortega said two us diplomats ordered to leave managua last 
week tried to use the teachers discontent to manipulate the 
unjust demands of the teachers 
vargas and vigil arrived in washington last week as part of a 
plan by both the us and nicaraguan governments to replenish their 
respective diplomatic staffs in each others country 
the staffs had been decimated last july when managua ordered 
eight american envoys home and washington responded by expelling 
eight nicaraguan diplomats 
the agreement by the two countries to send replacement envoys 
was reached only a few weeks ago 
last week the sandinista government expelled us embassy 
economic attache joel cassman and a visiting us labor attache 
based in honduras kathleen barmon on grounds they had incited 
nicaraguan teachers to join a wildcat strike cassman had arrived 
in managua just a few days before vargas and vigil assumed their 
duties in washington 
at the time the americans were expelled the state department 
denied they had engaged in improper activities boucher said 
wednesday the department waited six days in hopes the sandinista 
government would reverse the decision 
the expulsion was ordered only after it became clear that the 
sandinista decision was final boucher said nicaraguan embassy 
spokeswoman cecilia lopez declined comment on the us action 
boucher called the sandinista allegations against the americans 
false absurd and not worthy of further comment 
he added that the expulsion of the americans was intended to 
draw attention away from the dissatisfaction of nicaraguan 
workers with sandinista economic policies and to deflect 
responsibility for this unrest from the nicaraguan government 
still boucher used the occasion of wednesdays announcement to 
discuss the possibility of genuine accommodation between the two 
countries 
if the sandinista government takes concrete steps toward 
holding free and fair presidential elections tentatively set for 
feb 25 the united states is willing to respond positively he 
said 
in the wake of these events we hope that all interested 
parties will redouble their efforts to bring true democracy and 
authentic national reconciliation to nicaragua via the electoral 
process 
previously the state department had criticized new electoral 
and media laws approved in nicaragua as unfair to opposition 
parties but boucher made no reference to that issue wednesday

it turns out that president bush 
knows how to play poker by his own rules bush waited for the 
soviet union to raise twice before he even put his arms control 
ante on the table 
then the president upped the stakes called the hand and said 
the next move was moscows 
in his debut at the western summit bush claimed a double hit 
proposing conventional arms limitations he said would transform the 
military map of europe and gaining a compromise on his terms to 
settle west germanys unwelcome demand for immediate negotiations 
aimed at reducing shortrange nuclear missiles 
after a quick aerial commute from brussels to bonn on tuesday 
he assured the germans that they were happy about it whats more 
west german chancellor helmut kohl agreed and said the presidents 
overnight visit would be a major political plus as he seeks to 
defend his leadership in elections next year 
the administrations concern is that negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear missiles might bring pressure to eliminate those weapons 
just as moscow and washington agreed in 1987 to eliminate 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles bush and secretary of state 
james a baker iii both said and repeated that there can be only 
partial reduction in shortrange missiles that they will be needed 
for the foreseeable future to offset eastern bloc manpower in 
europe 
in any event the missile negotiations are not even to begin 
until there is a pact on reduction of conventional arms in europe 
that will not satisfy kohls opposition on the left even though 
the chancellor said the compromise made everyone a winner 
to ease any political sting bush who faced us criticism and 
pressure of his own for going slowly on arms control spoke of that 
problem wednesday in a speech in mainz 
to those who are impatient with our measured pace in arms 
reductions i respectfully suggest that history teaches us a lesson 
that unity and strength are the catalyst and prerequisite to arms 
control the president said 
europe is the most heavily armed continent in the world he 
said nowhere is this more apparent than in the two germanys 
that is why our quest to safely reduce armaments has a special 
significance for the german people 
that quest had been on hold since bush took office pending he 
said a review of foreign and defense policies even when the 
administration pronounced study time over the speeches in which 
bush described his plans were relatively pallid short on drama 
hardly a comeback to the peace offensive of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev had announced one set of conventional arms cuts 
proposed terms for negotiations on another and threw in a 
unilateral cut of 500 shortrange nuclear weapons bush held his 
cards and kept his poker face although the administration welcomed 
soviet arms cut proposals that were offered 10 days ago saying 
they held promise and moved toward the goals of the western allies 
moscow now has called the bushnato proposals to limit troops 
and weapons a positive step suggesting at the same time that 
conventional arms cuts should cover everything the bush plan 
doesnt mention naval forces in the european theater 
while bush said hed known where he was going all along there 
had been evidence of white house frustration at gorbachevs success 
in dominating the debate 
according to the administration the bush proposals for 
conventional arms cuts began to take their final form after 
discussions at his home in kennebunkport maine over a long 
weekend visit that began may 18 administration emissaries were 
sent to nato capitals to talk about the arms reduction proposal 
brief allied leaders and build a consensus 
baker said the arms cut plan was shaped on a separate track 
apart from the policy review 
all the various bureaucracies in the federal government that 
have to consider these things ultimately considered this 
proposal baker said but it wasnt put into the general 
review it was dealt with at a higher level in the government 
finally on monday bush was ready unveiling at nato his call 
for cuts to 275000 us and soviet troops in europe with ceilings 
on tanks artillery and combat aircraft as well it built on both 
western and soviet proposals and bush proposed that it all be done 
about five years faster than gorbachev suggested 
while bush said hed been immune to all the criticism the 
charges that he was a donothing leader he acted as though a cloud 
had been lifted 
the president said it showed the way he intends to lead the 
allies and the free world 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers was said to have told the 
summit the experts may not be happy with this but as a 
politician i think its the right thing to do 
prime minister margaret thatcher of great britain called it 
clear quality leadership but she said that never had been in 
doubt even when bush was taking what he called a hammering for 
failing to respond to gorbachev 
i much prefer a leader to be measured rather than dashing into 
things she said 
no more poker face

vice president dan quayle will make his second 
trip to central america june 1114 on a mission to encourage 
democratic freedoms under el salvadors new government and 
intensify opposition to panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
quayles office announced today 
quayle will travel to guatemala honduras el salvador and costa 
rica the four us allies in the region and meet with each 
countrys president he also will meet with leaders of the 
usbacked contra rebel movement that opposes the leftist 
government of nicaragua quayle aides said 
in el salvador where the newly elected president alfredo 
cristiani was being inaugurated today quayle also will meet with 
military leaders he is expected to underscore the prohuman rights 
message he delivered during a visit there in february 
quayles journey will come after a special delegation reports 
june 6 to the organization of american states on its recent mission 
to panama 
the diplomats from trinidad guatemala and costa rica ended four 
days of talks aimed at finding a solution to the political crisis 
stemming from may 7 elections that were widely seen as having been 
rigged by noriega 
the united states condemned noriega beefed up its troop 
presence in panama and urged allies in the hemisphere to isolate 
the general 
quayle is expected to rally us allies in the antinoriega 
effort 
although the oas team has not issued its report there are no 
indications the country is any closer to resolving its situation 
in which noriega ultimately invalidated the election results 
quayle aides did not disclose where the vice president would 
meet with the contras whose troops are encamped inside honduras 
near the nicaraguan border 
the bush administration is providing nonlethal aid to the 
contras to keep their forces in place for a year while the central 
american countries work on a diplomatic solution to the contra war 
in el salvador quayles visit will serve to underscore support 
for cristiani at a time when some congress members have expressed 
concerns about continuing us aid to that country because of the 
ties between his rightist political party arena and past death 
squad activity 
quayle and other us officials however say cristiani deserves 
a chance to prove he is committed to democracy and the prohuman 
rights government he has promised 
our reading is theyve been pretty responsible to date it is 
a situation weve got to keep our eyes on said one 
administration official 
quayles meeting with salvadoran military officials is not 
expected to carry the stern tone of his previous message 
his earlier visit the first foreign trip of the newly 
inaugurated bush administration was to highlight us attention to 
the region and to warn el salvador that the countrys daily 15 
million in us military and economic aid would be in jeopardy 
unless there was a crackdown on human rights violations by the 
military and civilian groups 
the bush administration and congress recently worked out what 
officials said was a tentative agreement to continue us military 
aid to el salvador while taking into account congressional concerns 
about a rightist resurgence there 
some lawmakers also complain an end to el salvadors civil war 
is no closer although the united states poured out more than 35 
billion in aid since the early 1980s marxistled guerrillas have 
been battling the salvadoran government since 1979 
the bush administration fought off congressional moves to 
sharply cut back aid to el salvador but in recent negotiations for 
inclusion of new assistance in foreign aid legislation democrats 
won some concessions from the administration congressional and 
administration sources said 
the talks produced agreement for annual military aid of 85 
million the same figure as this year 
the agreement called for an administration report at sixmonth 
intervals on el salvadors protection of human rights and progress 
on a negotiated settlement to the rebel war

here are excerpts from house speaker jim 
wrights statement wednesday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for 34 years i have had the great privilege to be a member of 
this institution the peoples house and i shall forever be 
grateful for that wondrous privilege 
i never cease to be thankful to the people of the 12th district 
of texas for their friendship and their understanding and their 
partiality toward me 
eighteen times they have voted to permit me the grand privilege 
of representing them here in this depository of the democratic 
principle 
only a few days ago even in face of harsh news accounts and 
bitter criticisms they indicated in a poll taken by the leading 
newspaper in the district that 78 percent of them approved of my 
services 
and you my colleagues democrats and republicans have 
given me the greatest gift within your power to give to be the 
speaker of the united states house of representatives is the 
grandest opportunity that can come to any lawmaker anywhere in the 
western world 
i am proud of a number of the things that we have done together 
while you have let me be your speaker for your help your 
great work and for permitting me to be a part of this institution 
while that was happening i thank you 
and i love this institution and i want to assure each of 
you that under no circumstances having spent more than half of my 
life here this house being my home would i ever knowingly or 
intentionally do or say anything to violate its rules or detract 
from its standards 
now all of us are prone to human error for over a year 
i have ached to tell my side of the story today silence is no 
longer tolerable nor for the good of the house is it even 
desirable i owe it to you and to the american people to give a 
straightforward answer im convinced that im right maybe im 
wrong 
i know that each of us as benjamin franklin suggested should 
be careful to doubt a little his own infallibility 
and so lets look at each of the charges made one by one 
dispassionately 
did my wife bettys employment at 18000 a year for some four 
years by a small investment corporation which she and i formed 
with friends of ours george and marlene mallick and the attendant 
benefits of that employment use of an apartment when she was in 
fort worth on company business and the use of a companyowned car 
constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift from our 
friend mr mallick 
was bettys employment and those things related to it a gift 
why was betty working for the corporation 
george mallick my partner was too busy looking into his own 
interests marlene mallick was raising family i was busy 
being a member of congress and majority leader i didnt have any 
time to spend on it betty alone among all of us had the time and 
the opportunity and the experience and the desire to give effort 
and energy to exploring and promoting investment opportunities 
she did indeed perform work and it paid off for the little 
corporation she advised as to when was a good time to sell 
stocks when was a good time to buy and the corporation made some 
money betty paid for her salary several times over 
she maintained very frequent contract with a drilling company 
in west texas in which each of the four partners had an 
interest she went to new york and studied the gem stone 
business she looked into other prospective investments

wrights offers for the record affidavits from five individuals 
who attest that mrs wright earned her 18000 salary 
the outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested 
that mrs wrights employment somehow amounted to a gift 
does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes so many 
pages of typed manuscript she wasnt a carpenter is a womans 
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a 
work product 
for most of her adult life mrs wright has been a business 
person been an officer in a large hotel an officer in a 
successful real estate and construction firm a professional staff 
person on a congressional committee 
she was making more than 18000 when she worked at the 
congressional committee 
and heres the irony the supreme irony 
in 1976 when i was elected majority leader betty voluntarily 
left her job as a prfessional staff person on the committee so as 
to avoid any criticism 
now it just seems to me there isnt any justification at all for 
anybodys even raising questions about whether she earned her 
18000 a year betty also had the use of a company car that 
is true she did 
i want to do the right thing the honorable thing 
i bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds 
what more can i do does that make it right 
now concerning the apartment we didnt think there was 
anything wrong with paying a per diem rate we paid on a daily 
basis for our use of that apartment 
nevertheless last year i said to george mallick i said i want 
to buy the apartment i paid the amount suggested and appraised 
by two real estate persons in fort worth 58000 i just 
wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say if weve made a 
mistake weve done what we can to set things right i dont think 
weve violated any rules 
the second alleged violation continues on the assumption 
that george mallick our friend and business partner had a direct 
interest in influencing legislation which would make it illegal 
for us to accept gifts from him 
ive known this man for more than 25 years hes been my 
friend never once in all the years that ive known this man has 
he ever asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation 
 
not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any 
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any 
institution in which he has an interest 
now the only other basic question its just one that remains 
in the statement of alleged violations concerns the sale of a 
book a little book now youll recall reflections of a public 
man which i wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities 
people who took it and gave it away to other people students 
newspapers public officials and members of their organizations 
and i wanted them to i wanted to get the widest possible 
distribution of the book 
now the contention is that this book project on which i 
got 325 for every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a 
subterfuge itself and an overall scheme for me to exceed and 
violate the outside earnings limitation of a member of congress 
if monetary gain had been my primary interest dont you think i 
would have gone to one of the big madison avenue publications the 
houses there that give you a big advance 
it is true i think that people on my staff were eager to sell 
these books they knew i wanted them sold ive got to accept some 
responsibility for that if it was wrong but the rule doesnt say 
it was wrong the rules expressly exempt royalty income i 
didnt intend to try to violate the outside earning limitations and 
i dont believe legally that i did

wright maintains during a lenghty discourse that details of the 
book deal were erroneously characterized by the outside counsel 
investigating the matter for the ethics committee he suggests the 
process of ethics investigations needs improvement 
maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification 
maybe the committee that is currently required to sit as a kind of 
grand jury and petit jury both ought to have a different 
composition maybe once a report of alleged violations is 
issued the committee rules ought to allow the member to respond 
expeditiously 
you know to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly can 
cause serious political injury it is unfair in my case for 
example the committee has yet to release any witness testimony or 
documents that it obtained during the investigation 
perhaps we want to consider outright abolition of all honoraria 
speaking fees altogether in exchange for a straightforward 
honest increase in the salary for members of all three branches of 
the government 
it is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualified 
members of the executive and legislative branches are resigning 
because of ambiguities and confusion surrounding the ethics laws 
and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personal 
attack 
thats a shame 
its happening 
and it is grievously hurtful to our society 
when vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate 
when negative campaigning becomes a fulltime occupation when 
members of each party become selfappointed vigilantes carrying out 
personal vendettas against members of the other party in gods 
name that is not what this institution is supposed to be all about 
when vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication harsh 
personal attacks upon one anothers motives and one anothers 
character drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important 
issues things that we ought to be involved ourselves in surely 
that is unworthy of our institution unworthy of our american 
political process 
all of us in both political parties must resolve to bring this 
period of mindless cannibalism to an end 
there has been enough of it 
when i first came here all those years ago in 1955 this was a 
place where a mans word was his bond and his honor and truth of 
what he said to you were assumed you didnt have to prove it 
now we need that 
have i made mistakes 
oh boy how many 
i made a lot of mistakes 
mistakes in judgment oh yeah 
a lot of them 
ill make some more 
have i contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of a frenzy of 
feeding on other peoples reputations 
have i at all caused a lot of this 
so maybe i have god i hope i havent but maybe i have 
have i been too partisan 
too insistent 
too abrasive 
too determined to have my way 
perhaps 
maybe so

if i have offended anybody in the other party im sorry 
i never meant to would not have done so intentionally 
i always tried to treat all of our colleagues democrats and 
republicans with respect 
are there things i would do differently if i had them to do over 
again 
oh boy how many may i name for you 
well i tell you what im going to make you a proposition 
let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation 
for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us give 
it back to you 
i will resign as speaker of the house effective upon the 
election of my successor and ill ask that we call a caucus on the 
democratic side for next tuesday to choose a successor 
i dont want to be a party to tearing up the institution 
i love it 
to tell you the truth this year it has been very difficult for 
me to offer the kind of moral leadership that the organization 
needs because every time i have tried to talk about the needs of 
the country the media have not been interested in that they 
wanted to ask me about petty personal finances 
you need somebody else 
so i want to give you that back 
well have a caucus on tuesday 
and then i will offer to resign from the house sometime before 
the end of june 
let that be a total payment for the anger and hostility that we 
feel for each other 
lets not try to get even with each other 
republicans please dont get in your heads you need to get 
somebody else because of john tower 
democrats please dont feel you need to get somebody on the 
other side because of me 
we ought to be more mature than that 
lets restore to this institution the rightful priorities of 
what is good for this country the nation has important 
business and it cant afford these distractions and that is why i 
offer to resign 
i am not a bitter man 
i am not going to be 
i am a lucky man 
god has given me the privilege of serving in this the greatest 
institution on earth for a great many years and i am grateful to 
the people of my district in texas i am grateful to my colleagues 
all of you 
god bless this institution 
god bless the united states

some people infected with the aids virus may elude 
screening tests intended to protect blood banks because they 
produce no telltale antibodies against the lethal virus for years 
researchers reported today 
widely used screening tests cannot see the aids virus directly 
instead they search for antibodies that people produce as part of 
their natural reaction to infection 
the latest work however found that some people produce no 
antibodies even though they have been infected for years with hiv 
the aids virus therefore the aids tests are useless against their 
blood 
in an editorial published with the study in the new england 
journal of medicine dr william a haseltine of bostons 
danafarber cancer institute cautioned that the research raises 
the sobering possibility that hiv1 infections may be transmitted 
by blood and organ donors who are silently infected 
dr david t imagawa who directed the study at the university 
of california los angeles agreed that people with such latent 
infections might pass on the virus he added that homosexuals 
should continue to refrain from donating blood 
however at the american association of blood banks dr amoz 
chernoff downplayed the importance of the discovery to the nations 
blood banks 
chernoff noted that the study was conducted in homosexual men 
who had highrisk sexual practices if such people gave blood they 
probably would also be infected with the hepatitis virus so their 
blood would be screened out by other tests 
the relevance of these data to the blood banks is probably 
negligible he said but this will be followed to make sure it 
doesnt have an impact 
antibody screening of large population groups also is used to 
gauge how many people are infected with hiv the us centers for 
disease control estimates that between 1 million and 15 million 
americans carry the virus 
the new research means that the infection could be 
considerably more widespread than we anticipated haseltine said 
in an interview 
the work shows that hiv can permanently insert itself into the 
genes of blood cells but stay hidden so the body never attacks it 
with antibodies people may make no aids antibodies for three years 
and perhaps much longer after they become infected 
while the study raises concern about the effectiveness of 
current screening tests there is also a bright side to the finding 
the good news is that at least some fraction of people when 
exposed seem to control the infection said haseltine we 
would guess that as long as it stays in that controlled state 
people are going to stay healthy it gives us a new target to shoot 
for in terms of therapy 
the research was based on 1637 homosexual men in los angeles 
among them were 133 men who had no aids antibodies but continued to 
engage in anal sex in test tubes their white blood cells were 
stimulated to grow this released any aids virus hidden inside the 
cells so it could be detected 
they found that 31 of the 133 had silent aids infections while 
four eventually began to produce aids antibodies the rest did not 
for followup periods up to three years 
how long this quiet state of infection may last is unclear 
although researchers speculated it might be lifelong for some 
people 
there is a distinct possibility that in spite of their 
infection they never may go on to get aids imagawa said

here is a transcript of house speaker jim 
wrights statement wednesday 
mr speaker for 34 years i have had the great privilege to be a 
member of this institution the peoples house and i shall forever 
be grateful for that wonderous privilege 
i never cease to be thankful to the people of the 12th district 
of texas for their friendship and their understanding and their 
partiality toward me 
eighteen times they have voted to permit me the grand privilege 
of representing them here in this depository of the democratic 
principle 
only a few days ago even in face of harsh news accounts and 
bitter criticisms they indicated in a poll taken by the leading 
newspaper in the district that 78 percent of them approved of my 
services and that includes 73 percent of the republicans in my 
district and i am very proud of that 
and you my colleagues democrats and republicans i owe a great 
deal to you 
you have given me the greatest gift within your power to give 
to be the speaker of the united states house of representatives 
is the grandest opportunity that can come to any lawmaker anywhere 
in the western world 
and i would be deeply remiss if i didnt express my sincere 
appreciation to you for that opportunity 
i hope that i have reflected credit upon the people of my 
district who know me best perhaps and upon the people of this 
house who next to them who know me best 
i am proud of a number of the things that we have done together 
while you have let me be your speaker 
i am proud of the record of the 100th congress 
many people feel that it is the most responsive and most 
productive congress in perhaps 25 years 
all of you who were here in that congress had a part in that 
many of the things we did were truly bipartisan in character 
together we made it possible for great leaps forward to be made 
in such things as our competitiveness in the world 
together we fashioned the beginnings of a truly effective war 
on drugs to stamp out that menace to the streets and schools and 
homes of our nation 
we began the effort to help the homeless we still have work to 
do to make housing affordable to lowincome americans so that there 
wont be any homeless in this country 
we did things to help abate catastrophic illness provide 
welfare reform legislation clean water legislation and a great 
many other things that i shall not detail 
for your help your great work and for permitting me to be a 
part of this institution while that was happening i thank you 
and i shall forever be grateful for your cooperation 
and i love this institution 
and i want to assure each of you that under no circumstances 
having spent more than half of my life here this house being my 
home would i ever knowingly or intentionally do or say anything to 
violate its rules or detract from its standards 
now all of us are prone to human error 
the speaker of the house is in fact the chief enforcer of the 
rules of the house 
its really a wonderful thing that any member of the house may 
at his will bring question against any other member and under our 
rules that has to be looked into 
and i have no quarrel with that nor any criticism of people who 
have served on the committee on standards 
its a thankless job and you have to have such things 
for over a year well just about a year i have ached to tell 
my side of the story 
that to which i have to respond keeps changing 
but today silence is no longer tolerable nor for the good of 
the house is it even desirable 
so without any rancor and without any bitterness or any hard 
feelings toward anybody i thank you for indulging me as i answer 
to you and to the american people for my honor my reputation and 
all the things ive tried to stand for all these years 
the past year while the committee on standards has had these 
matters under advisement i have ached for the opportunity to speak 
almost daily i besought them to let me come and answer whatever 
questions they had on their mind 
finally on the 14th of september they gave me one day in which 
to do that 
i gratefully went and spent the whole morning and the whole 
afternoon answering as candidly and freely as possibly i could any 
questions that anyone would ask and i believe when i left everyone 
was reasonably well satisfied 
suffice to say that the five original charges that had been 
lodged were dropped dismissed

<TEXT>
in their place however came three additional charges 
some said 69 
the 69 are merely a matter of multiple counting of the three 
in april the committee said well they thought there was some 
reason to believe that rules may have been violated in these three 
basic areas 
i owe it to you and to the american people to give a 
straightforward answer on those three areas 
im convinced that im right maybe im wrong 
i know that each of us as benjamin franklin suggested should 
be careful to doubt a little his own infallibility 
but before those charges were issued as press leaks filtered 
out almost daily tarnishing my reputation and by inference 
spilling over onto the reputation of this institution i pleaded 
for the privilege to come and answer those questions before charges 
were made 
under the rules that was not permitted to me and they were 
formally made 
and so lets look at it one by one dispassionately 
the committee has raised these three basic questions doesnt 
say that theres clear and convincing proof that i violated the 
rules doesnt say that they know that i violated the rules it 
said they have some reason to believe i may have and for these 
last few weeks ive been trying to refine that and get an 
opportunity to address it 
nows the day im going to do it now 
the three questions are these 
did my wife bettys employment at 18000 a year for some four 
years by a small investment corporation which she and i formed 
with friends of ours george and marlene mallick and the attendant 
benefits of that employement use of an apartment when she was in 
fort worth on company business and the use of a companyowned car 
constitute merely a sham and a subterfuge and a gift from our 
friend mr mallick was bettys employment and those things related 
to it a gift 
youve read in papers the suggestion made by committee counsel 
that i may have received up to 145000 in gifts from my friend mr 
mallick half of it 72000 was bettys income bettys salary 
the other half involved the use of a car and the use of an 
apartment on a per diem basis 
whether its right or wrong lets look at it bettys 
employment was that a gift 
first question i should like to i suppose you might be asking 
why was betty working for the corporation why did we put her to 
work at 18000 a year the answer is really very simple

a woman who was jailed after her husband took 
their 4yearold son from a hospital where he was undergoing 
courtordered treatment for luekemia was cited for contempt of 
court and denied release wednesday 
family court judge leon deutsch said he didnt believe the 
mother migdalia pagan when she said she didnt know the 
whereabouts of her husband and son 
deutsch said mrs pagan 35 would be brought from a city jail 
where she has been held since tuesday to his courtroom daily until 
the boy was returned 
my plea is to the mother and the father if he can hear me if 
he comes forward and produces the child i will order her release 
forthwith deutsch said at the hearing 
mrs pagan 35 who appeared distraught did not speak at 
wednesdays hearing she told the judge under oath tuesday before 
her arrest that she did not know where her husband and son had gone 
david pagan 36 took his son darian from the memorial 
sloankettering hospital sometime sunday police said 
darian was hospitalized friday under an order from deutsch that 
was requested by the citys child welfare administration because 
hospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment he 
needed 
family members have said that darian had been complaining of 
pain and that the father wanted to take the boy to disney world in 
florida 
police said they received information that pagan may have taken 
darian to a cancertreatment center in arlington texas 
mrs pagans lawyer steven mandel called deutschs detention 
order improper and said he would appeal it thursday 
mandel charged that the judge was using mrs pagan as 
leverage to pressure the father to come forward 
the lawyer insisted that mrs pagan was telling the truth when 
she said she didnt know where her husband and son had gone he 
said the husband had called a family member once since disappearing 
said only that he and darian were safe 
mandel said that when hospital officials went to the city 
agency doctors said darian was in imminent danger if he did 
not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy 
the parents who live in brooklyn were upset because no such 
treatment was administered between friday when the boy was 
admitted and sunday when he was taken from the hospital mandel 
said 
he said the child had received much medical care and treatment 
for leukemia since he was diagnosed at age 2

she was the only one of the four of us who had the time and the 
inclination to look into the investment opportunities that our 
investment corporation was created to explore 
george mallick my partner was too busy looking into his own 
interests he had business interests of his own 
marlene mallick was raising family 
i was busy being a member of congress and majority leader i 
didnt have any time to spend on it 
betty alone among all of us had the time and the opportunity 
and the experience and the desire to give effort and energy to 
exploring and promoting investment opportunities 
she did indeed perform work and it paid off for the little 
corporation 
she did it well she studied and followed the stock market on 
regional stocks buying and selling 
some of them stocks i had brought into the corporation that i 
had owned personally my personal estate 
she advised as to when was a good time to sell when was a good 
time to buy and the corporation made some money on those regional 
stocks not a lot of money by some peoples standards but we made 
some money 
betty paid for her salary several times over 
she maintained very frequent contract with a drilling company 
that was drilling a series of gas wels exploratory gas wells in 
west texas in which each of the four partners had an interest 
having all borrowed money from the corporation in order to do that 
she visited the site of drilling and maintained contact with the 
company for us in that instance 
she went to new york and studied the gem stone business and the 
corporation made an investment in gem stones made some money on 
that 
she looked into the possibility of the corporation mallightco 
building apartment complexes for young people but concluded that 
the interest rates were unfavorable 
betty spent a considerable amount of time studying the wine 
culture industry which was then just getting started in texas 
she made an economic study that concluded that it was too 
speculative for a little corporation of our type 
she looked into other prospective investments such as a small 
limited partnership in the movie annie and a prospective 
venture in sulphur extraction but advised against both of those 
investments 
and its lucky for us she did because people who invested in 
them lost money

i want to include for printing in the record affidavits from 
several business people who know from their personal experience and 
attest to the work that betty did in this regard 
and it will appear in the record at this point an affidavit by 
pamela l smith one by kay f snyder one by john freeman one by 
louis a farris jr and one by jb williams all attesting to 
their personal knowledge of these things that betty did in working 
for the corporation for 18000 a year 
the outside counsel employed by the committee has suggested that 
mrs wrights employment somehow amounted to a gift i dont know 
why but he assumed that the services she rendered could not have 
been worth 18000 a year how he concludes that she didnt perform 
duties is to me a mystery 
on page 20 of the statement of alleged violations i find a very 
strange suggestion based on a statement that quote there was no 
evidence either supporting or establishing that the money paid to 
mrs wright was in return for identifiable services or work 
products 
frankly i dont know exactly what mr phelan means by work 
products 
does he want so many pages of canceled shorthand notes so many 
pages of typed manuscript she wasnt a carpenter is a womans 
mental study and her time and her advice not to be counted as a 
work product 
how the committee could conclude that there was no evidence that 
betty performed duties is very puzzling to me they dont offer any 
evidence that she did not 
when i was before the committee that wasnt one of the things 
that was being considered they didnt ask me to go into any 
elaborate detail as i have just done telling the things that she 
did they assumed assumed that there was no evidence 
ah but there was evidence the two people of whom questions 
were asked aside from myself mr mallick himself and pamela smith 
both testified that she did work 
mr phelans report says that they couldnt identify but maybe 
12 days in the whole fouryear period in which she worked

well thats an inaccurate representation of what they said 
pamela smith both in this affidavit and in her testimony before 
the committee clearly said she saw betty there from five to seven 
days every month and on weekends and she spoke of her knowledge 
of her doing work in washington and new york and elsewhere so 
theres evidence 
well does one conclude that my wifes services to that little 
corporation were worth less than 18000 a year 
for most of her adult life mrs wright has been a business 
person been an officer in a large hotel an officer in a 
successful real estate and construction firm a professional staff 
person on a congressional committee 
she was making more than 18000 when she worked at the 
congressional committee 
and heres the irony the supreme irony 
in 1976 when i was elected majority leader betty voluntarily 
left her job as a professional staff person on the committee so as 
to avoid any criticism of this institution or of her husband on the 
ground that we were both on the public payroll 
how many colleagues in the house and the senate do you know 
whose wives are on the public payroll doing good work 
and yet betty didnt want to be the cause for even unfounded 
criticism 
she was legally entitled to continue she having occupied that 
job before our marriage but she chose to leave and save the 
institution and her husband from unwarranted criticism 
thats the kind of person she is 
now it just seems to me there isnt any justification at all for 
anybodys even raising questions about whether she earned her 
18000 a year 
should a member of congress have to prove that his wife earned 
that much money bear in mind this money was not paid by mr 
mallick the money was paid by the corporation of which betty and i 
were halfowners inaudible 
in addition to her salary as a gift outside counsel contends in 
summing up 145000 inaudible that betty had the use of a company 
car that is true she did for the first three years it was used 
largely by mr and mrs mallick 
it wasnt mr mallicks car it was the company car the company 
bought and paid for it we owned half of it the next four years 
betty had most of the use of it 
now ive done what i can to resolve any doubt 
i want to do the right thing the honorable thing 
i bought and paid for that car out of my personal funds 
the trustee of my bank trust at my instruction paid the 
corporation full book value for the car on the day betty first 
started driving it on company business through the whole time she 
had it in her possession plus interest 
the interest amounted to about 9000 
what more can i do does that make it right

cbs 101 and abcs 91 
i know my first name is steven the factbased story of

now concerning the apartment betty and i have been more than 
anxious to do whats right and honorable about that 
we didnt think there was anything wrong with paying a per diem 
rate 
the apartment was not held out for rent to anybody else 
it wasnt owned for rental purposes 
mallick found he didnt want anybody else in the apartment 
they owned about five apartments in this apartment unit complex 
area and held them out for their employees and their family 
there wouldnt have been anybody in the apartment paying any 
amount of money at all if they hadnt permitted us when we were in 
town and betty was doing company business to occupy the apartment 
we paid on a daily basis for our use of that apartment 
meanwhile in an effort to resolve any doubt last year i told 
mr mallick that i didnt like the situation being criticized 
he said well ralph lotkin the committee counsel said that it 
was all right it was in the paper printed in the paper four years 
ago the fort worth newspaper a statement quoting the chief 
counsel of the committee on standards mr lotkin saying he didnt 
see anything improper with it i relied on that 
nevertheless last year i said to george mallick i said i want 
to buy the apartment george ill pay you for it i did i paid 
the amount suggested and appraised by two real estate persons in 
fort worth 58000 now if anybody thinks thats too low a price 
ill sell it to you today for 58000 
well i just wanted to clear the air and remove doubts and say 
if weve made a mistake weve done what we can to set things right 
i dont think weve violated any rules i think youre entitled to 
know that my respect for you leads me to want to tell you that 
the second alleged violation continues on the assumption that 
bettys employment and these little benefits that she had were 
gifts and then it further assumes that george mallick our friend 
and business partner had a direct interest in influencing 
legislation which would make it illegal for us to accept gifts 
from him 
now how do they arrive at that suggestion ive known this man 
for more than 25 years hes been my friend good decent 
hardworking man of lebanese extraction his father had a wholesale 
grocery store there his grandfather came with a wagon and a cart 
to georgia hes been successful moderately so 
never once in all the years that ive known this man has he ever 
asked me to vote for or against any piece of legislation not once 
thats not the basis of our friendship thats not the way our 
relationship inaudible 
you have friends like that 
they never ask for anything 
all they want is to be friends 
not one time has he ever asked me to intercede with any 
administrative agency of government on behalf of him or of any 
institution in which he has an interest not once not once 
so how do they say that he had a direct interest in influencing 
legislation 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP890601-0030 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
on page 58 of the committee report it is suggested that simply 
because he was in the real estate business that he had some oil 
and gas investments the committee might infer thats the word 
the committee might infer that he could be deemed a person with an 
interest of a direct nature in legislation 
the committee suggests he might have an interest in the tax 
code well who doesnt every taxpayers got an interest in the 
tax code everybody who ever expects to receive social security has 
an interest in the social security code all people have an 
interest of some kind in the results of legislation dont they 
thats not what were talking about were talking about whether 
or not they have a direct interest in trying to influence the 
course of legislation 
now where would you go to find out what that means if somebody 
wanted to associate with you in some way and be in business with 
you some way back home in a perfectly legal way whether he had an 
interest in legislation or not 
whom would you consult if you were in doubt about it i wasnt 
in doubt but suppose you were 
wouldnt you think youd consult the publications of the 
committee consult the people who wrote the rules 
well the people who wrote the rules dont think george mallick 
had an interest in the legislation 
david obey was the chairman of the committee that drafted those 
rules he asserts clearly unequivocally emphatically 
unabiguously both in an affidavit that he wrote and the report he 
wrote for the washington post that doesnt fit george mallicks 
case 
he doesnt have an interest in legislation as defined under the 
rules the rules that david and his committee wrote harold sawyer 
former republican member from michigan who served on that 
committee with david obey says the same thing 
i have here an affadavit from mr sawyer in which he states 
exactly that same conclusion 
and theres an affidavit of donald f terry who was currently 
is employed now by the committee on small business but was a staff 
member on the commission on administrative review which was charged 
in 1976 with the responsibility of drafting new rules of official 
conduct for the house most of what he refers to has to do with the 
question of book royalties i shall come to that next 
but in these matters these three people who had a great deal to 
do with writing the rules say thats not what they intended when 
they wrote the rules i offer these for printing in the record 
where else might you turn if you were in doubt 
might you not possibly go to the committee itself to see what 
advisory opinions it has given 
here is the publication that the committee sends to all of us to 
tell us what is and is not legal 
each year we receive this as instructions for filling out our 
financial disclosure statement 
appendix e is an advisory opinion no 10 which defines who has 
a direct interest in legislation under the law 
it says that if the member does not believe that the donor of 
the gift has a distinct or special interest in the congressional 
legislative process which sets him clearly apart from general 
public then the member should feel free to accept such gifts 
thats the official advice from the committee given to every 
member 
then it defines in summary who has an interest in legislation as 
prohibitedunder the rule 
four classes thats all registered lobbyists george mallicks 
not a registered lobbyist somebody that employes a registered 
lobbyist george mallick never did that somebody who directs or 
operates a political action committee george mallick has never 
done that or finally any other individual which the member knows 
not should know or ought to suspect or ought to infer but which 
the member knows has a distinct and special interest in influencing 
or affecting the legislative process 
not just somebody whos got an interest financially in the 
outcome of legislation not at all 
somebody that you know who has a direct or special interest in 
influencing the outcome of the legislative process inaudible 
that was just simply not the case 
so he had no direct interest in the legislation of any type 
that anybody could define

now we have motions before the committee to set that aside set 
aside that presumption of a mans having direct interest in 
legislation if they havent got a reason to believe he has 
the only they have suggested is that in 1986 his son borrowed 
money from a savings and loan to build a little shopping center of 
his own wholly apart and foreign to any investments betty and i 
had nothing to do with it at all his son 
and that in 1987 the lending institution had to foreclose 
yeah but the period when betty was employed presumably as a 
gift was 1981 to 1984 
he couldnt have known in 81 and 84 that his son was going to 
borrow money in 86 and the thing go bad in 87 and the economic 
decline make it impossible to pay off his note on time he couldnt 
have known that 
and anyway would you stretch the thing to the point of saying 
that just anybody who has a member of his family that owes money to 
a bank or a savings and loan is forbidden 
of course you wouldnt thatd cover more than half the citizens 
of the country 
the people who wrote the rules dont believe that hes covered 
the people whove been interpreting the rules dont believe hes 
covered and so i think under all reasonable circumstances that 
motion ought to be agreed to it ought to be agreed to if rules 
mean anything if were not just going to turn the whole thing on 
its head and change rules by whim every time we turn around 
now the only other basic question its just one that remains 
in the statement of alleged violations concerns the sale of a 
book a little book now youll recall reflections of a public 
man which i wrote and which was sold sometimes in bulk quantities 
people who took it and gave it away to other people students 
newspapers public officials and members of their organizations 
and i wanted them to 
i wanted to get the widest possible distribution of the book 
a book that you write kinda part of you you think of it a child 
almost its probably not great literature but i like it 
marty tolchin of the new york times john silber president of 
boston university jim lehrer of macneillehrer report and dr 
tucker chancellor of tcu all said nice things about it and i 
appreciate that

now the contention of the committee as i understand it is that 
this book project to publish that book on which i got 325 for 
every book that sold was a kind of a sham and a subterfuge itself 
and an overall scheme for me to exceed and violate the outside 
earnings limitation of a member of congress 
i mean do you think id do something like that 
perhaps the book 325 is what i got out of it and i didnt 
get any advance the purpose of the book was to publish something 
at a small cost and get wide distribution 
if monetary gain had been my primary interest dont you think i 
would have gone to one of the big madison avenue publications the 
houses there that give you a big advance 
i know people who received advances before a single book sells 
from those big companies twice and three times as much as i got in 
the total sales of all those books 
if it had been a scheme to get around outside earning limits 
thats what i might have done 
i hear that a woman author of a book called mayflower madam 
got 750000 in advance royalties i dont know that to be true 
a former speaker mr oneill is said to have received a 
million dollars for his excellent and readable book in advance 
before any of them were sold 
i have read that a woman named kitty kelly has received as much 
as 2 million in advance royalties for a book shes written on 
nancy reagan which as i understand it is not even an authorized 
biography 
well so much for that 
it is true i think that people on my staff were eager to sell 
these books they knew i wanted them sold 
ive got to accept some responsibility for that if it was wrong 
but the rule doesnt say it was wrong 
it couldnt have been an overall scheme to avoid outside earning 
limits because the rules are clear 
theyre not equivocal 
the rules expressly exempt royalty income 
and that too is attested to by david obey its attested to by 
donald terry who gives the rationale and the expression 
there wasnt any exception 
book royalties were exempted 
now maybe they shouldnt have been 
now maybe somebody got the impression that buying a book was the 
price of getting me to make a speech 
i never intended that impression i never suggested that 
i hope that friends of mine did not 
of all the books that were sold the outside counsel suggests 
that seven cases involve instances where individuals associated 
with organizations to which i made speeches bought multiple copies 
of the books and distributed them among members of the organization 
or others 
now i have not been permitted to see the copy of their 
testimony so i dont know exactly what they said 
ive asked people on my staff did you tell these folks that 
they had to buy these books or i wouldnt make a speech 
they said no they didnt 
the total amount as i figure from all of those sales that are 
involved is about 7700 what i received 
and id do whatever was necessary whatever was right 
if those people were under the impression that i wasnt going to 
make a speech to them unless they bought a bunch of books if they 
wanted their money id give them that money i dont want the 
money 
thats not important 
whats important is a persons honor and his intergrity 
during that threeyear period when the counsel says there are 
seven instances where i made speeches to groups and they bought 
copies of these books seven groups seven instances i made at 
least 700 speeches for which i didnt get any honorarium 
didnt offer to sell anybody a book 
nobody had the chance to buy a book 
do you suppose if there had been an overall scheme there 
wouldnt have been a wider kind of an experience than that 
i dont know 
im just saying to you that i didnt intend to try to violate 
the outside earning limitations and i dont believe legally that i 
did 
some of the rest of you make a lot of speeches 
how many speeches do you suppose you make that you dont get 
anything for 
most of us do well what can i do 
one other thing about the books that i suppose needs elaboration 
it involves the allegation in the statement of alleged 
violations that a man named s gene payte a reputable businessman 
in fort worth paid for more books that he got from the publisher 
that they didnt deliver enough books to him 
now thats what was said in the report of the outside counsel 
s gene payte upon reading that report issued an affadavit 
that is not ambiguous at all 
heres what mr payte says 
ill read in part this affidavit and put the whole thing in the 
record 
he says i have read the report of special outside counsel 
richard j phelan on the preliminary inquiry conducted pursuant to 
the committees june 9 resolution as it relates to my testimony i 
also have reviewed the transcript of my deposition testimony the 
report and also the conclusions reached by the special counsel 
ignored much of the most pertinent testimony in the transcript 
takes certain statements out of context distorts clear statements 
of fact and in general fails fairly and accurately to summarize the 
matters as to which i testified

for years solidarity advocated boycotting 
elections because the outcome was controlled by the ruling 
communists 
now with poles about to choose the first freely elected 
legislative chamber in the east bloc the newly reinstated free 
trade union movement must teach its supporters how to vote 
that is not a simple matter 
voters on sunday will receive from four to seven ballots and 
must cross out the names of the dozens of candidates they do not 
want 
the ballots moreover will not identify the affiliation of the 
candidates 
learn remember and note down the names of the solidarity 
candidates instructs one of the leaflets solidarity is 
distributing to make sure voters cast valid ballots 
the complicated procedure is a major hurdle facing solidarity as 
it mobilizes for the first elections since 1947 to allow candidates 
not backed by the communist party 
the solidarityled opposition believes it will be able to 
safeguard the honest conduct of the election as its people will 
comprise about a third of the members of the commissions running 
the elections 
at stake are all 100 seats in the resurrected senate and the 460 
seats in the existing sejm or parliament independent candidates 
may only run for 161 seats in the sejm 
it is the first election of this kind and i personally assume 
that there will be a considerable number of invalid votes said 
miroslaw sierawski a district election official for the democratic 
party part of the ruling communist alliance 
the communist coalition is giving its own voting lessons 
although they are less critical because it is guaranteed 65 percent 
of the seats in the more powerful sejm 
solidarity however has launched a massive information campaign 
to provide the names of its candidates and instructions on voting 
techniques it also plans to have information tables outside as 
many polling places as possible 
on television solidarity turned the lesson over to a popular 
commedian who was shown packing several pairs of glasses lest his 
poor eyesight result in a miscast vote 
solidarity activists have aroused government anger for 
suggesting in some publications that one way to ensure valid votes 
for solidarity candidates is to cross out all other names 
only the opposition thats no proposition goes a 
government slogan 
the targets of a crossout campaign would include 35 key 
candidates of the communist coalition who are running uncontested 
for the sejm but must receive at least 50 percent of the vote in 
order to be elected 
the key candidates include high government party officials such 
as prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski and interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak 
kiszczak led the government delegation in the talks with the 
opposition that produced the historic accord restoring solidarity 
after a sevenyear ban and outlining the terms under which the 
opposition is taking part in elections 
solidarity leader lech walesa has told supporters to evaluate 
party candidates individually

but the conclusion reached by the special counsel that quote 
i quote from the outside counsel report wright violated rule 
soandso clause four was based on category of assertion that 
quote gene payte did not receive the books 
the special counsel asserts payte testified and i am quoting 
that he only received between 300 and 500 copies of the book for 
6000 and makes the flat statement quote gene payte did not 
receive the books citing as authority paytes transcript 
now here is what payte says on the contrary i did not so 
testify i stated not once but three times that i believe that 
1000 books were delivered to me transcript 27 40 41 
the special counsel ignores this testimony 
instead he cites transcripts 77 and that citation does not 
support the special counsels assertion transcript 77 shows that 
congressman myers not i made the comment i believe you said 
you received three to 500 books i did not confirm that 
recollection my reply being i would like to have all the books 
in fact i never so testified 
so this is a copy of that affidavit which i should like to 
submit for the record together with a copy of a letter that was 
sent by the committee to mr payte after he issued this affidavit 
telling him he ought not to comment 
what do you think of that 
a private citizen a reputable citizen of my community 
misquoted in a document published at public expense sent widely to 
newspapers throughout the country widely cited as authority 
uncritically assumed to be accurate 
the citizen being misquoted issues an affidavit to straighten 
it out and so not be misquoted in the public record 
and then he is warned by the committee that he may be held in 
violation and contempt of congress if he doesnt shut up 
first amendment rights supersede any rules of any committee 
and any citizen of the united states ought to have the right to 
have his own testimony correctly characterized and not be 
threatened silenced by a house committee 
any house committee owes to a citizen of the united states that 
right that privilege 
well those are basically the matters that pend before the 
committee in our motion to dismiss 
those motions could clear the air 
rules are important just like the constancy of what a law means 
is important to a citizen 
if they can resolve these particular legal issues as to what 
constitutes direct interest in legislation and whether or not book 
royalities are exempt as the rules say they are 
i think it is important for the motions to be ruled upon and i 
earnestly hope that the committee will look at it from that 
standpoint and grant our motions 
members are entitled to know what the rules mean and if they 
still mean what they meant when they were written and promulgated 
now maybe the rules need to be changed 
if so lets change them in the legal orderly way lets vote 
on them lets vote to change them 
maybe the whole process needs some change and clarification 
you know we may want to consider the house may want to 
consider establishing a house counsel to whom members can look for 
official advice and then rely on that advice 
the rules of the committee itself might need some 
reconsideration 
having gone through this agonizing experience for about a year 
now i mean almost every day there is a new story in the newspaper 
leaked without any chance of me to know what is coming next and no 
chance of me to go to the committee and answer it and say hey 
wait a minute that is not correct that is not right 
maybe the committee that is currently required to sit as a kind 
of grand jury and petit jury both ought to have a different 
composition 
rather than those who issue the statement of alleged violation 
being the same people who have to judge them i think it clearly is 
difficult to expect members who have publicly announced reason to 
believe there is a violation to reverse their position at a hearing 
stage and dismiss charges against a member 
maybe once a report of alleged violations is issued the 
committee rules ought to allow the member to respond expeditiously 
you know to deny a member the opportunity to reply quickly can 
cause serious political injury 
it is unfair 
once alleged violations are announced the committee ought to 
just immediately release to the member all the evidence that it 
could have to indicate that thats happened 
in my case for example the committee has yet to release any 
witness testimony or documents that it obtained during the 
investigation 
why hide the evidence what is there to hide 
this ought not to be the kind of proceedings in which strategic 
maneuvering be allowed to override fundamental relations of fair 
play 
i urge the abolition of the gag order too which the committee 
said it forbids any witness who comes and makes a deposition from 
discussing publicly or telling his side of the thing 
and i just suppose the charges which the committee concludes 
are unfounded should not be published and widely disseminated as 
though were true and bore the imprimatur of the committees 
approval 
there are other things you want to consider 
i am not trying to give you an exhaustive list of what might 
happen 
i know there are others who have views that are equally relevant 
perhaps we want to consider outright abolition of all honoraria 
speaking fees altogether 
maybe we want to do that 
i dont know 
its up to the house 
in exchange for a straightforward honest increase in the salary 
for members of all three branches of the government 
it is intolerably hurtful to our government that qualified 
members of the executive and legislative branches are resigning 
because of ambiguities and confusion surrounding the ethics laws 
and because of their own consequent vulnerability to personal 
attack 
thats a shame 
its happening 
and it is grievously hurtful to our society 
when vilification becomes an accepted form of political debate 
when negative campaigning becomes a fulltime occupation when 
members of each party become selfappointed vigilantes carrying out 
personal vendettas against members of the other party in gods 
name that is not what this institution is supposed to be all about 
when vengeance becomes more desirable than vindication harsh 
personal attacks upon one anothers motives and one anothers 
character drown out the quiet logic of serious debate on important 
issues things that we ought to be involved ourselves in surely 
that is unworthy of our institution unworthy of our american 
political process 
all of us in both political parties must resolve to bring this 
period of mindless cannibalism to an end 
there has been enough of it 
i pray to god that we will do that and restore the spirit that 
always existed in this house

when i first came here all those years ago in 1955 this was a 
place where a mans word was his bond and his honor and truth of 
what he said to you were assumed you didnt have to prove it 
i remember one time cleve bailey west virginia in a moment of 
impassioned concern over a tariff bill jumped up and made an 
objection to the fact that chet hollifield had voted in those 
days we shouted our answers to the votes and hollifield was back 
there in the back 
and bailey said i object to the gentlemens from california 
vote being counted he came down and voted late he said he 
was not in the chamber when his name was called and therefore hes 
not entitled to vote 
it was a close vote 
speaker rayburn grew red as a tomato and i thought he was going 
to break the gavel when he hammered 
he said the chair always takes the word of a member 
and then because i was sitting over here behind cleve bailey i 
heard other members come and say cleve youre wrong chet was 
back there behind the rail and i was standing by him when he 
answered his answer just wasnt heard 
others said you shouldnt have said that 
and cleve bailey crusty old west virginian came down here and 
abjectly literally with tears in his eyes apologized for having 
questioned the word of a member 
now we need that 
have i made mistakes 
oh boy how many 
i made a lot of mistakes 
mistakes in judgment oh yeah 
a lot of them 
ill make some more 
recently let me just comment on this briefly because its such 
a sensational thing and the injurys been done to me in this 
particular moment because of it 
john mack 
many of you remember him know him 
i think a lot of you like him and respect him 
i helped john one time in his life when he was about 19 years 
old 20 
i didnt know him never had met him 
i didnt know the nature of a crime that he had been convicted 
of 
i knew only that john mack was a young man whom my daughter had 
known in high school 
my daughter was married to his brother incidentally 
thats how she knew about john 
and she mentioned it to me 
all i knew was that hed been convicted of assault and that hed 
served 27 months in a fairfax county jail 
contrary to whats been published i did not interfere with the 
court 
i didnt suggest anything to the court 
i didnt have anything to do with his sentencing 
i really didnt know and didnt inquire maybe thats bad 
judgment i didnt inquire as to the exact nature of the crime 
the sheriffs office in fairfax county called and asked me if i 
would know of any job that i could help this young man get 
they wanted to parole him 
they said hed been a model rehabilitated prisoner 
and i gave him a job as a file clerk you know 9000 a year 
after that he really blossomed and grew and developed and those 
of you who know him cant conceive as i never could conceive when 
finally just two years ago i read in the newspaper the precise 
nature of that crime 
it just didnt fit his character 
he married had two beautiful children 
wonderfully responsible and i think had become a very fine 
person 
now was that bad judgment 
you know maybe so 
it doesnt have anything to do with the rules but its got all 
mixed up with it and i dont think its bad judgment to try to 
give a young man a second chance 
maybe i should have known more about it 
but in this case i think he has turned out well 
and i dont believe that america really stands for the idea that 
a person should forever be condemned but i think maybe ought to 
have a second chance 
and thats what i thought in the case of john mack 
good judgment or bad i mean thats it 
i believe in giving somebody a second chance

have i contributed unwittingly to this manic idea of a frenzy of 
feeding on other peoples reputations 
have i at all caused a lot of this 
so maybe i have god i hope i havent but maybe i have 
have i been too partisan 
too insistent 
too abrasive 
too determined to have my way 
perhaps 
maybe so 
if i have offended anybody in the other party im sorry 
i never meant to would not have done so intentionally 
i always tried to treat all of our colleagues democrats and 
republicans with respect 
are there things i would do differently if i had them to do over 
again 
oh boy how many may i name for you 
well i tell you what im going to make you a proposition 
let me give you back this job you gave to me as a propitiation 
for all of this season of bad will that has grown up among us give 
it back to you 
i will resign as speaker of the house effective upon the 
election of my successor and ill ask that we call a caucus on the 
democratic side for next tuesday to choose a successor 
i dont want to be a party to tearing up the institution 
i love it 
to tell you the truth this year it has been very difficult for 
me to offer the kind of moral leadership that the organization 
needs because every time i have tried to talk about the needs of 
the country about the needs for affordable homes jack kemps idea 
or an idea that we are developing here everytime i have tried to 
talk about the need for minimum wage tried to talk about the need 
for day care centers embracing ideas on both sides of the aisle 
the media have not been interested in that 
they wanted to ask me about petty personal finances 
you need somebody else 
so i want to give you that back 
well have a caucus on tuesday 
and then i will offer to resign from the house sometime before 
the end of june 
let that be a total payment for the anger and hostility that we 
feel for each other 
lets not try to get even with each other 
republicans please dont get in your heads you need to get 
somebody else because of john tower 
democrats please dont feel you need to get somebody on the 
other side because of me 
we ought to be more mature than that 
lets restore to this institution the rightful priorities of 
what is good for this country 
lets all work together to try to achieve them 
the nation has important business and it cant afford these 
distractions and that is why i offer to resign 
i have enjoyed these years in congress 
i am grateful to all of you who have taught me things and been 
patient with me 
horace greeley had a quote that harry truman used to like 
fame is a vapor popularity an accident riches take wings those 
who cheer today may curse tomorrow only one thing endures 
character 
i am not a bitter man 
i am not going to be 
i am a lucky man 
god has given me the privilege of serving in this the greatest 
institution on earth for a great many years and i am grateful to 
the people of my district in texas i am grateful to my colleagues 
all of you 
god bless this institution 
god bless the united states

a federal grand jury will soon start hearing 
testimony about the office hiring practices of walter fauntroy the 
district of columbias nonvoting delegate to congress the 
associated press has learned 
as part of the ongoing justice department inquiry current and 
former employees of fauntroy a democrat and rep gus savage 
dill will be asked to testify on fauntroys hiring of savages 
son according to sources familiar with the investigation 
thomas john savage the son of rep savage was paid 21398 
while on fauntroys payroll between september 1987 and june 1988 
but swore on illinois election documents that he was living in 
chicago during that time those records were filed as part of his 
unsuccessful bid to win an illinois house seat 
employees from the fauntroy and savage offices will be 
subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury within the next month and 
investigators have already subpoenaed payroll documents and office 
personnel data from the two congressmen said sources who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity 
those records have been requested to determine whether the 
younger savage his father or fauntroy falsified payroll documents 
or offered false statements to investigators 
fauntroy and rep savage refused to comment when asked whether 
documents from his office had been requested by federal authorities 
when contacted by telephone in chicago thomas john savage 
declined to comment wednesday 
in addition investigators are examining all of fauntroys 
congressional staff and committee hirings for the past five years 
the sources said 
investigators are also examining the personal banking records of 
thomas savage to learn whether he returned any money to his father 
or fauntroy the sources familiar with the investigation said 
investigators also are closely examining accounts of the younger 
savages job duties submitted voluntarily to federal officials by 
johnny barnes fauntroys chief aide and several other fauntroy 
staffers sources said 
barnes refused wednesday to comment on the documents 
the fbi opened the case with a 90day preliminary investigation 
in december shortly after the ap reported on fauntroys hiring of 
the younger savage 
officials at the justice departments criminal division then 
recommended that attorney general dick thornburgh appoint a special 
prosecutor to look into the case under the terms an order by his 
predecessor edwin meese iii that rule instituted by meese just 
days before he left office last august required an independent 
prosecutor to examine cases of alleged wrongdoing by members of 
congress 
however thornburgh scuttled the meese order and turned the 
investigation back to the justice departments criminal division 
which traditionally handles such cases

a leading economic expert today attacked 
treasury secretary nicholas bradys plan for reducing third world 
debt saying the proposal will not effectively reduce the billions 
paid out every year in interest 
the debt of the developing nations is estimated at 12 
trillion about half of it owed to commercial banks 
john williamson senior fellow at the institute for 
international economics points to an outflow of 373 billion from 
debtor to creditor countries last year 
it still looks as though it will be difficult to achieve 
debtservice reduction of 7 billion a year with a pool of 25 
billion or less williamson wrote in a revised edition of his 
study voluntary approaches to debt relief published today 
debt service usually includes payments on both principal and 
interest few of the troubled debtor countries have paid any 
principal since 1982 some such as argentina are far behind on 
their interest payments 
williamson suggested that a pool of 40 billion to 50 billion 
is needed some of the new borrowing might be used by the debtors 
to pay off old debt at a discount he would like see some old debt 
swapped for new debt with interest assured to the banks at a lower 
rate 
bradys proposal unveiled march 10 encourages banks to forgive 
a substantial portion of their loans to heavily indebted countries 
in return for guarantees that the rest will be paid the guarantees 
are to be furnished by the international monetary fund and its 
sister agency the world bank 
imf managing director michel camdessus said wednesday the 
commercial banks must do more to help third world countries reduce 
their debts 
treasury spokesmen refuse to estimate officially how much may be 
available for debt relief they say that will depend on how many 
countries ask for it and how many promise to meet the conditions 
the bank and fund require some austerity policies from the 
borrowing countries in return for help 
williamson says he finds disappointing bradys call for new 
policies by all debtors to qualify for support the economist 
suggests that countries which already have taken austerity measures 
should be rewarded with arrangements to provide a definitive 
solution to their crises he names bolivia chile colombia costa 
rica mexico and uruguay 
williamson sees a failure by brady to offer a solution to the 
problem of free riders creditor banks that refuse to make any 
reduction in the amount of debt or interest owed them 
williamson proposes that banks which will not provide any other 
debt relief should accept a limit on debtors payments to them the 
limit to be set by the amount the debtor country earns from its 
exports the rest of the money owed to the banks would be added to 
the total debt 
williamson is a former adviser to the british treasury and the 
international monetary fund the institute for international 
economics was created by the west german marshall fund and gets 
support from it and from other governments and foundations

overall prices on farm products edged upward 
last month with record demand for broilers potatoes and tomatoes 
according to the department of agriculture 
prices on raw products rose 27 percent from april to may and 
averaged 13 percent more than a year ago the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
increases in the prices of hogs oranges potatoes broilers and 
tomatoes were partially offset by lower prices for sweet corn 
eggs lettuce and soybeans said the departments agricultural 
statistics board in a preliminary report 
but broiler potato and tomato prices were at record levels 
hogs also increased sharply from april 
demand for oranges was so strong that the average price went 
higher than it has been since november 1987 
cattle prices continued close to april levels wheat and corn 
prices were up slightly while soybeans were down from a month 
earlier 
based on the preliminary figures the price index for livestock 
and livestock products was up 26 percent from april to may and 
46 percent above a year ago at this time 
compared with april higher prices for hogs and broilers more 
than offset lower prices for eggs and milk 
crop prices overall rose 36 percent from a month earlier and 
24 percent above a year earlier 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in may averaged 151 
percent of a 1977 base used for comparison 
the report said 
cattle averaged 7010 per 100 pounds of live weight 
nationally steady with april the average is for all types of 
cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4270 per 100 pounds compared with 3630 in 
april and 4630 a year earlier 
corn at 258 a bushel up from 256 in april and 198 in 
may 1988 
wheat prices at the farm according to preliminary figures 
averaged 407 per bushel compared with 403 in april and 297 a 
year earlier 
rice averaged 653 per 100 pounds down from 666 in april 
and 797 a year earlier 
soybeans were 715 per bushel compared with 729 in april

april and 33 cents a year earlier

farmers will have to reduce the acreage they 
plant in wheat next season by 5 percent agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter says 
we need more wheat said kelly shipp in explaining why the 
setaside was not higher 
each year the agriculture secretary is required to decide what 
if any acreage should be set aside in order to keep surpluses 
down yeutter could have asked for a greater acreage reduction or 
none at all 
in past years acreage has been reduced by as much as 25 percent 
because of large surpluses 
currently us wheat supplies are low because of the success of 
the program in the past and two years of drought 
yeutter said price support loans and purchase rates would be 
195 a bushel a 20 percent reduction from the basic loan and 
purchase rate of 244 
this is the minimum allowed by law and 5 percent below the 1989 
loan and purchase rate of 206 a bushel 
he also set the established target price at 4 a bushel the 
statutory minimum and down about 2 percent from the 1989 target 
price 
furthermore he said he would not implement paid land 
diversions marketing loans or related programs no secretary since 
1985 has implemented these programs for wheat or corn in part 
because prices have been high and there has been no need for them

seven days of drenching rain was good for the 
dry central plains states and western corn belt but caused 
flooding in the ozarks and ohio valley slowing fieldwork for the

harvesting under way in california georgia oklahoma and texas 
in kansas rain improved winter wheat condition but the outlook 
is still very poor to poor wheat streak mosaic and russian wheat 
aphids were problems in the panhandle of nebraska while hail 
damaged the crop in some eastcentral counties of arkansas 
spring wheat was mostly good to fair with planting 98 percent 
complete according to the report by the joint agricultural weather 
facility

barely an hour after jim wright announced he 
was resigning majority leader tom foley took to the telephone to 
rally support in a bid for speaker of the house that is likely to 
be uncontested 
foley who remained a wright loyalist to the end took his usual 
cautious approach in his pursuit of the speakership telling 
reporters late wednesday he assumed he would be a candidate 
as he did when he was elected to the no 2 leadership post 
foley said he intends to call all 259 of his democratic colleagues 
asking for their votes 
i will call as many as i can said foley who represents a 
mostly conservative district in eastern washington state that 
stretches from the canadian border to the oregon line 
foley said he had scrupulously avoided contacting any 
members prior to wrights wednesday announcement he was stepping 
down 
the difference now is that there is a vacancy said foley 
adding that even though no opponent for the speakership has 
surfaced he felt it necessary to ask members for their votes 
during his 25 years in congress foley has built a reputation as 
a skilled political negotiator more interested in compromise than 
confrontation foley is a consensus builder who is not adverse to 
engaging in trench warfare with republicans but would prefer to 
avoid it 
one of the things i would like to accomplish is to help bring 
a spirit of mutual respect and reconciliation back to congress 
said foley 
foley sat calmly in the speakers chair as wright delivered his 
resignation speech on the house floor wednesday immediately after 
returning to his office foley huddled with his top aides and 
started making phone calls democratic members of the washington 
state house delegation came first 
he told me he was absolutely running and asked for my 
support said rep norm dicks dwash a close friend of foley 
dicks said that foley was putting together a support group 
that would be making phone calls to other members 
i dont sense any need that he has to campaign but he has to 
go through the formality of asking members for their support 
said dicks 
rep al swift dwash said he too received a call from foley 
asking for his support 
its typical tom foley hes not taking anything for 
granted said swift 
he said it was absolutely essential that foley contact as many 
members as he can before the democratic caucus meets tuesday and if 
he had waited to start making those calls it might have sent the 
wrong message 
this is the kind of situation that if he made no move in five 
hours there would be rumors flying about foley not being interested 
in the job said swift a gaping silence could be interpreted 
as meaning he was having second thoughts or is taking it for 
granted 
foley is too skilled a politican to let that happen this is 
not a case of any disloyalty to wright

americas poor suffering from cuts in aid 
levels are spending three times as much of their income on home 
energy bills as the average us household according to a newly 
released study 
the report issued wednesday by the national consumer law center 
a nonprofit organization said many state governments have not 
made up fully for recent declines in federal energy assistance to 
the poor it said some states are cutting aid levels 
these factors all conspire to leave the poor mired in their 
energy crisis a crisis which is bound to continue said charles 
hill of the consumer group 
the study said lowincome households spend on average 11 
percent of their income on home energy costs compared with a 
national average of 34 percent 
among the groups other findings 
in 25 states plus the district of columbia average home energy 
bills for lowincome residents exceeded 1000 last year the 
highest was 1611 in delaware costs were below 800 a year in 
just three states california nevada and tennessee 
average home energy costs during the winter exceeded 100 a 
month for the poor last year in 43 states and the district of 
columbia 
in 10 of 16 states for which complete data was available on 
recipients of federal lowincome home energy aid the average 
household had 75 or less to spend per week on food transportation 
and other needs after paying winter heating bills 
alaska and hawaii were not included in the study for technical 
reasons the group said 
the study focused on several different categories of poor 
households to compare conditions for the elderly families of 
unemployed and households reliant on minimum wage jobs 
for widows or widowers of social security recipients average 
home energy bills in onethird of the states exceeded 20 percent of 
the benefits the highest was delaware 27 percent the lowest was 
13 percent in nevada and california 
for families in which the head of the household is employed at 
the minimum wage of 335 an hour average energy costs were more 
than 15 percent of income in 21 states plus the district of 
columbia 
in 17 states households in which unemployment compensation is 
the basic source of income had on average 100 or less a week to 
spend on nonenergy items during winter months those in 
massachusetts were best off with 164 a week left after paying the 
heating bills indiana was worst off at 75 a week 
the study said that while federal energy aid to the poor has 
been a major help since it was started in 1980 the amount of 
assistance has been declining since 1985 when the average benefit 
nationwide was 224 last years average benefit was 194 the 
group said and the figure is expected to drop again this year 
many states have supplemented the federal aid with money 
collected from oil companies for violating 1970s price controls 
but the study said it found that these additional state funds have 
not made up fully for the drop in federal aid

house speaker jim wright defended his decision 
of 14 years ago to hire a man who had been convicted of brutally 
assaulting a young woman saying he wanted to give a young 
gentleman a second chance 
near the end of his resignation speech on wednesday wright 
said i didnt know the nature of a crime that he had been 
convicted of i dont think its bad judgment to try and give a 
young gentleman a second chance 
wright hired john p mack as a mail clerk a 9000ayear job 
and mack rose to become wrights closest aide as executive director 
of the democratic steering and policy committee mack resigned that 
86000ayear position position may 11 after his victim pamela 
small told her story in the washington post 
maybe i should have known more about the crime wight said 
however i dont think that america really stands for the notion 
that a person should be forever condemned he added 
mack pleaded guilty to beating and stabbing ms small and 
leaving her for dead in 1973 after she asked him for assistance in 
a store in suburban annandale va where he worked mack 19 at 
the time of the crime was sentenced to 15 years in prison but 
served only 27 months in a county jail before being released 
wright noted that at the time he hired mack as a clerk wrights 
daughter was married to macks brother 
i didnt know him wright told the house wednesday i knew 
only that john mack was a young man that my daughter had known in 
high school all i knew was that he was convicted of 
assault 
mack had come under fire from several house members because 
they insisted he had never shown contrition for his crime and had 
offered no financial assistance to ms small in his resignation 
statement he apologized for a terrible and tragic mistake 
mack added to pamela small and also to my family all i can 
say now is what i have said many times before and to myself every 
day since this happened and that is i am sorry truly sorry

it was on a windswept mountaintop 
not far from this village that st patrick is said to have banished 
all snakes and reptiles forever from the emerald isle 
now many local people say a new menace has arrived in the form 
of international mining companies crawling all over western 
ireland looking for gold 
croagh patrick is one of irelans holiest sites and thousands of 
pilgrims climb its 2500 feet every july to pay homage to irelands 
patron saint at the chapel overlooking the sea many are aged or 
infirm some walk for hours barefoot over rocky trails praying or 
chanting 
now fears of an irish klondike have been provoked by the 
discovery of rich gold deposits on the slopes of croagh patrick and 
other nearby mountains 
at least one company has found gold in quantities of up to 67 
ounces per ton industry experts say gold worth about 360 an 
ounce becomes commercially viable at about a half ounce per ton 
opposing the mining companies and government are 
environmentalists and local residents thousands of whom have 
attended protest meetings and rallies 
christ when the money men wormed their way into the temple in 
jerusalem rose in anger and cast them headlong out let us cast 
the money men from our temple resident anne parker wrote in a 
recent letter read to a protest meeting in tully cross 
croagh patrick belongs to all christian people we in the west 
are its special guardians she wrote 
the companies say they are conducting environmental impact 
studies and deny their operations would harm the environment the 
government says the protests are premature and it has made no 
decision yet to grant mining licenses 
it also points out that mining could create jobs in an area 
where unemployment is about 20 percent 
but locals accuse the government of being too cozy with the 
companies they note that prime minister charles haugheys son 
conor is managing director of feltrim mining one of the 19 
companies searching around croagh patrick 
the protesters say the rush to extract gold a process that 
commonly employs cyanide and can be done by stripping could 
gravely threaten the sacred mountain and also undermine farming 
fishing and tourism western irelands economic pillars 
mining they say would destroy one of the cleanest and most 
striking places in europe cyanide runoff could poison the 
crystalline waterways of mayo and galway counties and kill the 
foxes ferrets badgers rabbits fish seals and hundreds of 
species of birds that live in one of europes last remaining areas 
of blanket bogland 
sometimes a balance has to be struck between beauty and 
material gain wrote joseph cassidy archbishop of tuam in a 
recent letter in the irish times 
beutiful places are gifts from god he wrote as such it 
is not just a local preserve but a national even international 
inheritance 
emer colleran chairman of irelands national trust is 
concerned about the future of a valley and lake well known to 
local salmon fishermen called doolough where the british company 
andaman resources and glencar explorations of ireland have found 
gold 
it is one of irelands major treasures she said it is 
remote untouched a wilderness like you rarely find anymore 
without a telephone pole or any other sign of human activity 
the lake looks black on gray days and it is quite magically 
gloomy and dark when the sun shines it is absolutely transformed 
with the lake a sapphire blue against the soft brown mountains 
she said 
although she does not oppose mining in general she would like 
doolough declared a national park 
eddie phelan a department of energy spokesman said the 
government is committed to the active investigation of the 
countrys mineral potential and the development of commercial ore 
subject to environmental safeguards as an important source of 
economic growth and employment opportunity 
the companies say they understand local concerns but accuse 
outsiders of misrepresenting their plans 
everyone says the environment is very important and we 
agree said michael murphy chairman of birman mining the 
company licensed to prospect on croagh patrick mining and 
environmental protection are not mutually exclusive

claiming to have a bomb two unarmed 
haitians tried to hijack an antillean airlines jet to israel on 
wednesday and were seized when it landed and passengers rushed for 
exits authorities said 
the two had boarded the dc9 in haiti apparently thinking it 
was bound for new york when its true destination was this tiny 
dutch island off the coast venezuela said airline spokesman robin 
visser 
he said one of the jets more than 100 passengers was slightly 
injured in the rush to leave the plane after it landed at hato 
international airport around dusk 
visser said the flight originated in miami and that an 
undetermined number of us citizens were aboard flight 974 
after its stopover in portauprince haiti one of the suspects 
told flight attendents that a small box he placed in a forward 
bathroom had explosives inside that could be detonated by a haitian 
army colonel in a submarine somewhere in the caribbean 
he and his companion demanded to be flown to tel aviv israel 
visser said 
the spokesman said the hijackers apparently thought they were on 
a flight to new york and the pilot continued on to curacao without 
telling passengers of the attempted hijacking having convinced the 
haitians they bound for new york 
the pilot taxied to a far end of the airstrip informed the 
passengers there was an emergency and ordered them off the plane as 
quickly as possible 
visser said that as people rushed for the exits in panic an alm 
employee who was aboard as a regular passenger jumped one of the 
haitians who surrendered and another haitian man was arrested on 
the tarmac 
local authorities had blocked roads leading to the airport and 
stopped all flights shortly before the plane landed in curacao 
explosives experts from the royal dutch navy based in curacao 
searched the plane but visser did not know whether they had found 
anything 
visser said the pilot dropped altitude from 29000 feet to 3000 
feet to lessen the chance of an explosion being set off by cabin 
pressure

jim wright never comfortable on television 
talked directly to the house he waved documents he held aloft his 
famous book he wiped his brow he spoke an hour and at the end 
almost in a mumble said that he would quit 
off in the republican seats sat newt gingrich gadfly from 
georgia wrights nemesis when the house stood to applaud wright 
gingrich rose too but didnt clap beside him republican leader 
bob michel offered a sad shake of his head he had witnessed a 
generational change and he is of the old generation gingrichs 
the new 
wrights speech was nothing fancy a detailed point by point 
rejoinder to the bill of particulars laid out against him by the 
ethics committee 
he belittled the 325 percopy royalty received on the book 
that had been sold in wholesale lots to lobbyists he said his 
wife betty had earned her 18000 salary they had paid for their 
condominium per diem said wright irate he produced someones 
affidavit and put it in the record 
he defended hiring a young man convicted of assaulting a young 
woman and said he had not inquired into the details of the crime 
and thought redemption was still a respectable american principle 
the speaker had wanted his day in court before his peers and he 
had it by the end the television networks with no drama to match 
this tuned in 
in wrights audience was lloyd bentsen who came over from the 
senate to be with a texas colleague tony coelho of california the 
democrats super fund raiser who stunned his party during the 
weekend by resigning to avoid going through the same ethics 
wringer bill gray of philadelphia who saw his chance to become 
the first black to climb into the house leadership endangered by 
leaked word of an fbi investigation involving his office 
wife betty wright sat in the gallery with jutted chin the 
venerated mo udall dariz just out of the hospital suffering 
from parkinsons disease took off his glasses leaned forward to 
catch wrights words 
tom foley dwash awesomely popular with both parties 
articulate and modern where wright is old fashioned a teddybear on 
television presided he is destined to become speaker next week 
when wright leaves 
bentsen sat mournful distracted coelho had the look of a man 
reprieved gray dangled his loafered foot in the aisle rushed up 
to wright when the speech was over gave him a bearhug 
before the speech the texas democrats had lunch with wright a 
solemn affair all said they posed for a picture before adjourning 
in the hours anticipating the speech david obey dwis idly 
toying with a pocketknife spoke of the foley speakership even 
before it started the world war ii generation is gone now he 
said 
a house reformer father of the new ethics rules obey glowed 
over foleys prospects he is a superb detail man a soviet 
scholar he said 
from the old guard came the voice of henry gonzalez dtexas 
who said he had warned back in 1977 that creating a committee of 
standards of official conduct congressmen judging congressmen 
would lead to ruin and disarray he had cast one of the 10 votes 
against it 
freshman ben jones dga said surely the house had seen worse 
moments they had people come at each other in duels here he 
said this building has been burned to the ground much worse has 
happened 
if history was being made here through it all the american 
tourists almost to the man woman and child dressed uniformly in 
shorts were oblivious they marched past rows of statues of the 
forgotten famous past zachariah chandler of michigan and jlm 
curry of alabama statesman educator patriot orator 
a woman in the visitors gallery told wright was about to make 
a speech and then resign said goody

the partying aboard the cruise ship st 
louis stopped when cuba and the united states refused to allow 937 
jews fleeing germany to land and start a life beyond the grip of 
nazi persecution 
to commemorate the voyage of the damned 50 years later 
herbert karliner has tracked down about 70 fellow survivors 
organizers of the anniversary plan to sink the remains of adolf 
hitlers yacht the ostwind off miami beach on sunday as an 
artificial reef the ostwind has been decaying in jacksonville for 
decades as various owners have considered plans to restore it 
the yacht florida princess will carry about 25 st louis 
passengers on sunday to the approximate point where the st louis 
was shooed away by the us coast guard on june 4 1939 but this 
time the travelers will receive a coast guard escort before 
docking in miami beach 
we must have been very close because i could see the palm 
trees said karliner a retired baker who was 12 at the time 
telegrams from the ship to president roosevelt and other world 
leaders went unanswered as the passengers tried desperately to find 
refuge the ship received orders to return to germany events 
dramatized in the 1975 movie voyage of the damned starring faye 
dunaway and max von sydow 
two days from a german port agreement was reached to split the 
passengers among england france netherlands and belgium but most 
who returned to europe would die in concentration camps 
we knew what the situation was in europe for the jewish 
population karliner said in an interview at his north miami 
home the crossing was wonderful we were very excited to be out 
of germany 
he has snapshots of smiling adults in dressy clothes at a 
banquet table and shipboard pals gathered for a childrens party on 
the trip south 
but the st louis would dock in havana harbor before most of the 
passengers learned their travel papers had been voided twentytwo 
passengers who obtained their documents from the cuban consulate in 
italy would be allowed to land but no one else 
there was near panic when we were still in the harbor said 
liesl loeb daughter of the chairman of the passenger committee 
an attorney jumped overboard and remained in a cuban hospital as 
the st louis set sail again while the passengers led by ms 
loebs father bargained for their future 
these men worked day and night i dont think my father slept 
one full night in our cabin after the crisis began said ms 
loeb a graphic designer in suburban philadelphia who celebrated 
her 11th birthday on the voyage 
about threequarters of the passengers were on an immigration 
quota system to enter the united states from three months to three 
years later said rabbi simcha freedman of miami beach who 
researched the cruise in conjunction with the anniversary 
the message they sent to hitler was we view the jewish issue 
as a side issue to world peace were they ever wrong said rabbi 
abraham cooper associate dean of the simon weisenthal center for 
holocaust studies 
many of the jewish men aboard were released from concentration 
camps for the trip on the condition they not return 
we felt we were free again but that didnt last long 
especially for those who went to holland belgium and france 
said karliner who grew up in a part of polish silesia that is now 
in east germany 
karliner who survived the war working on a french farm under a 
false name was bitter about us treatment of st louis passengers 
but emigrated with his brother in 1947 
where else france treated us also very badly a lot of people 
were so pronazi at the time he said i felt first of all that 
the us is the only country where there is really democracy 
his work with a holocaust study group encouraged him to pursue 
an anniversary observance for the st louis 
karliner located survivors as far away as australia and england 
but most will be coming from the united states 
the story of the st louis the tragic voyage that it took 
gives us a chance to focus in not so much on the horror that would 
transpire afterward but on the actual reasons why the holocaust 
came about said cooper

the resignation of house speaker jim wright 
removes a heavy political weight from democrats but also leaves 
open the question of whether the mindless cannibalism he warned 
against may consume others in an era of heightened public concern 
over ethics 
majority democrats may have cause for concern too with a newly 
aggressive republican minority hoping to parlay the ethics issue 
into success at the polls 
a sense of unease lingered in the capitol even after the 
widespread relief over the texans announcement wednesday a 
decision everyone had known for weeks was coming 
wrights supporters were bitter and some vowed revenge on the 
republicans 
one obvious potential target is rep newt gingrich of georgia 
who some democrats say skirted ethical standards with publication 
of his own book gingrich wrights earliest and most vocal 
accuser slipped out of the capitol without talking to reporters 
after the speakers resignation speech 
wright himself called for a truce in the ethics war that has 
claimed him and the no 3 house democratic leadership official 
rep tony coelho of california and holds the potential for 
wounding a number of others coelho stunned the house last week 
with his announcement that he would resign rather than face an 
ethics investigation into his own personal finances 
democratic rep robert torricelli dnj summed up wrights 
parting words this way a warning stop attempting to get each 
other stop looking for retribution and vengeance 
wright also said it is time to change the rules and procedures 
that led to his political demise before his case ever went to 
trial maybe the whole process needs some change and 
clarification he said 
but so far the victims have all been democrats and republicans 
may be forgiven if they have trouble understanding why they should 
agree to a ceasefire in a war they are winning 
after all democratic caucus chairman william gray of 
pennsylvania hoping to move up on the leadership ladder has been 
told that investigators are looking into questions about the 
running of his office he insists he is not a target of any 
investigation and is cooperating with officials but his irate 
complaint over news leaks of the inquiry are eloquent testimony to 
his fears of becoming a political casualty 
government sources also say a grand jury in washington dc is 
beginning to look into the hiring practices in the office of walter 
fauntroy a nonvoting delegate for the district of columbia and 
sources close to that investigation say it has raised questions 
about the son of illinois democratic rep gus savage 
none of this is nearly enough to challenge the democrats 
34year control over the levers of power in the house but its a 
gift from the republican point of view 
after all few believed anything would come of it when gingrich 
first announced his intention in december 1987 to file a formal 
ethics complaint against the speaker wright was the nations top 
elected democrat and many believed that the ethics committee 
rather than wright would flinch from confrontation 
that changed when the committee last july hired richard j 
phelan a chicago lawyer and an active democrat to run its 
investigation phelan brought a nonwashington perspective to the 
job and while wrights defenders said he was overzealous and out 
of control a majority of the committee believed otherwise 
as wright recited the charges and defended himself point by 
point on wednesday they did seem to some members too petty to 
cause an end to such a long and successful career 
after 35 years of effective and able service to his state and 
to the nation jim deserves better than this said sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas who listened to his colleagues hourlong speech 
in the house chamber 
but it also was true that wright provided the grist for a long 
investigation he had a history of entering financial ventures on 
tips and aid from friends and of skating close to if not over 
the line of ethical propriety those friends often appeared to have 
more than friendship in mind when they courted the favor of a 
powerful and rising congressman 
in the end that ethical line seemed to have shifted under him 
wright was the product of a texas morality of the wildcatting 
1950s sharing more in common with lyndon johnson than with ralph 
nader some of his colleagues say he failed to adjust quickly 
enough to the changing ethics climate in washington 
but to others wright was a victim of a partisan attack a 
coordinated blitzkrieg orchestrated by republicans with consummate 
skill we have carried negative campaigning into the 
postelection period said one democratic lawmaker who has 
followed wrights case closely 
some democrats are prepared to respond in kind 
theyre going to be sorry theyve set this in motion said 
rep frank j guarini dnj 
if republicans are fearful they dont sound it 
the resignation of two of the top three democrats in the house 
is the bitter fruit of 35 years of democrat control of that body 
said a paper prepared by the gop congressional campaign committee 
for use by gop lawmakers the democrats in the house have grown 
arrogant with their unchallenged power

house members shaken by jim wrights 
resignation speech say their chamber has become a partisan war 
zone and wonder whether political bickering will rage on despite 
the speakers call for a truce 
theres an evil wind blowing in the halls of congress today 
that is reminiscent of the spanish inquisition rep jack brooks 
said wednesday in likening the ethics charges that felled wright to 
cruel punishments against spaniards accused of heresy in 1478 
the mood described by the house judiciary committee chairman was 
echoed by others but lawmakers generally expressed hope that 
members would heed wrights plea in his speech to the house let 
us not try to get even with each other 
wrights emotional resignation speech culminated a yearlong 
15 million investigation by the ethics committee into the texas 
democrats financial dealings the formal probe began with charges 
filed against wright by republican rep newt gingrich of georgia 
now his partys whip and culminated in committee allegations of 
69 rules violations 
even supporters said they backed wrights decision to quit 
stating the ethics cloud hanging over him would have made it 
impossible for wright to remain an effective leader 
the speaker was praised by democrats and republicans alike 
president bush in a message from london referred to their shared 
home state of texas and said in spite of the present situation 
i believe the wright tenure was one of effectiveness and dedication 
to the congress of the united states 
but the words of praise were spiked with partisan bitterness 
especially toward gingrich who watched the speech stoically from 
the fourth row of the republican side of the chamber 
if gingrich wants to engage in open warfare there will be a 
democratic response came the blunt warning from rep bill 
richardson dnm he said partisan bickering has made the house a 
war zone not a legislative body both sides have had enough 
gingrich ducked out of the house chamber and avoided reporters 
after wrights speech 
other lawmakers issued more general warnings to all their 
colleagues 
rep henry hyde rill urged members to stop turning this 
place into beirut 
rep louis stokes dohio former chairman of the ethics 
committee warned that if the present mood remains the end result 
will be to destroy this institution the end result will be to 
destroy this institution as we know it today 
a more optimistic note was sounded by a staunch wright defender 
robert torricelli dnj who said wrights parting gift was a 
warning to stop the vengeance 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine praised 
wrights accomplishments on issues including trade welfare reform 
and civil rights 
every american whose company is able to compete overseas 
every retiree who need no longer fear paying a crippling medical 
bill will owe a substantial debt of gratitude to speaker wright 
mitchell said 
sen patrick leahy dvt said the resignation comes at a time 
that young people are saying why should i go into government 
why should i lay my whole life bare for something that may be 
destructive to me personally an awful lot of us are hearing that 
sort of thing from our children

camelot its not 
nevertheless the prison in this pastoral town is staging a 
production of the musical legend the allinmate cast has dubbed 
themselves the awesome convict players 
one massachusetts correctional institution prisoner asked that 
his parole be delayed so he could play the role of sir lancelot on 
opening night friday officials said 
during a dress rehearsal wednesday the cast proudly displayed 
the scenery they had painted the addition to the stage built in 
the prison carpentry shop and the tunics and robes they sewed under 
the tutelage of a volunteer costume mistress 
im sure from the outside it seems funny because camelot is 
supposed to be a perfect world and doing it in a prison is such an 
irony said holly ward the 28yearold director 
but ward who is not an inmate and her actors say prison 
theater is therapeutic 
camelot is a way to reassess your dreams and maybe to live out 
your dreams in some way said one inmate who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the inmate like others in the cast wouldnt say what crime he 
committed for his oneyear sentence 
the buildings at shirley 40 miles northwest of boston are used 
as a minimumsecurity prison aimed at reintegrating inmates who are 
soon to be released many are serving time for drug and alcohol 
offenses but some are finishing longer sentences for more violent 
crimes 
there are no bars fences or dogs prisoners so close to 
regaining their freedom rarely escape 
ward said her biggest problem is actors who keep being released 
just when theyve mastered their roles 
weve been through three arthurs and several merlins and 
several mordreds she said 
ward and jim kelley the prisons community service director 
said they were stunned when inmate gordon benjamin decided to delay 
his release so he could play the first knight of the round table 
five performances are scheduled through june 10 
benjamin was not at wednesdays rehearsal and did not return 
telephone calls to the associated press 
ive never seen a parole put off for this kelley said 
thats major 
ward began organizing inmate plays when she was a theaterarts 
student seven years ago she said she isnt quitting despite the 
birth of her first child last fall 
several years ago ward directed man of la mancha at norfolk 
prison and persuaded the broadway lead actor richard kiley to 
attend this time she has invited robert goulet who played 
lancelot in the film version of camelot starring vanessa 
redgrave and richard burton 
she believes acting helps the inmates develop selfesteem and a 
perspective on their own emotions 
some of them i have to teach them how to cry she said 
then i have to teach them how to stop 
the inmates said they love the romance the costumes the 
chivalry and the story of king arthurs betrayal and forgiveness 
the man who plays the villain arthurs bastard son mordred 
said he can relate to the character because he himself is an 
illegitimate child 
camelot which will cost less than 500 to produce is 
supported by a grant from massachusetts citizens against the death 
penalty kelley said the cast will give performances for fellow 
inmates town residents staff and state dignitaries and on 
closing night for family and friends 
their families are so proud of them ward said its the 
first time they can say i saw my son on stage instead of my son 
the criminal my son the prisoner

this is not your ordinary 
office plant 
a persistent ivy vine that once climbed only the front of the 
southern new jersey townships building inspections office made its 
way indoors about five years ago through a crack in the wall and 
apparently found it a good growing environment 
the vine now is in several offices lining the perimeter and the 
ceiling of the room it first entered and making its way up a dark 
stairwell toward offices on the second floor 
workers have allowed the vines offshoots to wind their way to 
the fire inspections office and out to the customer service area 
counter where a sign proclaims yes the ivy you see is real 
when it came inside no one saw reason to prune it in fact the 
employees marked its progress with small slips of paper 
it broke through the bricks and came popping up one day 
said secretary pat chatigny im sitting here typing one day and 
i looked up and saw the green coming out and we just decided to 
tack it up and let it grow

thousands of books whose absence was 
undetected by librarians have returned solving a mystery that 
brown county library didnt know it had 
because the library has yet to complete an automated inventory 
system employees were unaware many of the books had left the 
shelves without being checked out library director patricia la 
violette said 
about 4000 have been returned in a rush of deposits to night 
book drops during the past three weeks hundreds were left during 
the memorial day weekend 
ms la violette said the books began showing up after she got a 
telephone call may 8 from a weeping woman she said the caller 
related her mother had died leaving behind a large number of 
stolen library books 
ms la violette said the woman did not identify herself the 
library declined comment about the book returns for several weeks 
because it did not want to discourage the recovery she said 
most of the books are romances mysteries and popular novels 
others are hardback nonfiction works 
ms la violette said more than half the books did not contain 
the barcode stickers used in the librarys inventory system 
meaning they were taken before the coding system was established 
four years ago 
she said the library planned to request an electronic security 
system even before the books began showing up

memorial services to honor the late 
us rep claude pepper were scheduled for his miami district and 
the capital of the state he represented in washington for more than 
40 years 
congress meanwhile formally accorded pepper the honor of lying 
in state today in the us capitol rotunda which has been granted 
previously to only 26 americans his house colleagues paid tribute 
to him as a national treasure and as mr senior citizen for 
his work on behalf of the elderly 
pepper 88 died of stomach cancer tuesday at walter reed army 
hospital in washington 
a viewing was scheduled at central baptist church in miami on 
saturday afternoon followed by a memorial service sunday 
afternoon another viewing will be held in the rotunda of the old 
state capitol in tallahassee on sunday evening 
pepper will be buried monday in tallahassees oakland cemetery 
alongside his wife mildred who died of cancer in 1979 
gov bob martinez urged the legislature to name the states new 
department of education building in honor of pepper 
it would be fitting to name this important building in state 
government after a man who decade after decade stood tall for the 
interests of the people he served said martinez 
peppers body was to lie in state in the nations capital for 
five hours this afternoon a resolution approving the honor was 
approved by the house 3970 on wednesday the senate approved it 
on a voice vote 
he developed that innate human sympathy that identified with 
the problems of people who are suffering house speaker jim 
wright told the chamber before announcing his own resignation 
claude pepper was a voice for the voiceless he offered a helping 
hand to the helpless 
rep silvio conte rmass recalled the scene when president 
bush went to walter reed last thursday to present pepper with the 
nations highest civilian award the medal of freedom 
despite what was obviously a great deal of pain claude 
apologized to the president and first lady that he couldnt stand 
up conte said 
he didnt have to stand up conte said he was a giant 
pepper was to be only the second incumbent member of the house 
to lie in state in the rotunda the first was rep thaddeus 
stevens rpa in 1868 the last member of congress so honored was 
sen hubert h humphrey dminn in 1978 
he joins an honor roster that includes presidents and military 
leaders and the unknown dead chosen to represent americans killed 
in four of americas wars 
martinez declined to comment on a date for a special election to 
fill peppers seat until services are concluded

residents of the city jim wright 
represented for 34 years expressed little surprise that he resigned 
as house speaker but expressed sorrow and fear about the loss of 
political clout they will suffer 
theres no question this is a tremendous loss for the 
community anybody who knows anything of the american political 
process knows the loss of the speakership is a major loss for this 
area said mayor bob bolen whose community has long counted 
wright as a major asset in attracting defense jobs 
stinging from an ethics investigation of his business dealings 
and sales of a book wright told the house on wednesday he would 
resign by the end of june 
people gathered around the televisions in an electronics shop at 
a shopping mall to watch wrights hourlong nationally broadcast 
speech 
i think its horrible said lynn bratcher hes the 
only one that has ever really done anything for anyone for texas 
i think its a shame and disgrace that the news media has 
challenged his integrity 
staffers at wrights office here said they listened to his 
resignation speech but refused to talk about it 
all i can say is the speaker has spoken and he speaks for 
us said larry shannon director of the office who with the 
backing of two security guards turned reporters away 
inside his staff appeared to be carrying on business as usual 
at another federal office workers turned on the radio and 
cheered as wright spoke 
one woman yelled touche as wright dismissed the house 
ethics committees charges that he violated congressional rules 69 
times 
but minutes later they fell silent as wright said i give you 
back this job promising to give up the speakers post and 
then his seat sometime in june 
at baileys barbq across the street from the federal offices 
talk was about daily business not wrights problems but patrons 
gave varied responses when asked their opinions 
in my opinion it probably was the best thing for him said 
deborah frazier hes had his day i think he should resign to 
save face 
im glad hes going because they need to get it all 
straightened out said bruce westrick i just think he got 
caught 
ken fowler said wright got chopped upby the media adding 
you can find something wrong in anyone if you go looking for 
it 
some state politicians believe wrights resignation could damage 
texas fragile economic recovery that has become dependent on 
billions of dollars in government contracts 
gov bill clements texas only 20th century republican 
governor said the fort worth democrat had represented the state 
well 
this is not a good day for texas clements said as 
speaker of the us house of representatives jim wright proved to 
be one of the states most valuable assets and a great national 
leader he brought jobs and opportunities to texas and he always 
remembered that his roots were in texas 
in weatherford the ranching town about 30 miles west of forth 
worth where wright grew up and served as mayor in 195054 mayor 
sherry watson said his resignation was truly awful 
officials said it may be impossible to rebuild the political 
power or match the economic gain the region enjoyed from wrights 
34year tenure and his leadership in the democratic party 
although wright urged his colleagues against seeking retribution 
on his account texas democratic party chairman bob slagle said 
unless some substantial reciprocal gesture is made by 
republicans i must confess that jim wright has a much more 
charitable and christian outlook towards this than i have

businessman george mallick has no plans 
to offer betty wright another job now that her husband has resigned 
as house speaker 
i dont believe i can afford her he said aside from jim 
wright shes a capable businesswoman shes been in business all 
her life the only reason she worked for 18000 a year was because 
she owned half the company 
mallick 54 said wednesday in an interview at his office that 
no basis exists for allegations that mrs wright might have been 
paid only as a courtesy to wright for potential political influence 
dogged by an ethics investigation of his business dealings and 
sales of a book wright said wednesday he would step down from his 
leadership post next week and leave congress by the end of june 
even though mrs wright has not worked for him in four years 
mallick said her encouragement and influence has left a positive 
imprint on those who still work for his real estate development 
company 
i didnt get a bargain said mallick of mrs wrights 
18000 salary i got a windfall 
mallick said he was asked by the house ethics committee for 
evidence that mrs wright had worked for him and he responded by 
providing reports and brochures she had written he said 
allegations against her were a cheap shot 
she found investment opportunities and discussed them with 
me mallick said 
mallick challenged the news media to ask the committee to 
provide the undisclosed testimony and evidence involving the wright 
investigation despite the texas congressmans decision to resign 
i want you to go out and dig up the truth he said 
that truth he said will vindicate wright 
mallick said he didnt expect to hear from wright on wednesday 
but anticipated a call tonight i want to say to him i 
understand i know what youve done i know why you did it 
at first mallick said he was surprised and shocked as he 
watched wrights announcement but he agreed with wright as the 
veteran congressman asked fellow house members to halt mindless 
cannibalism against some lawmakers 
something has to be done to stop this madness thats going 
on mallick echoed 
wrights decision to give up his lifelong dream of being speaker 
was not easy mallick said adding that wright had called him may 
21 to ask his advice 
he very truly is a man of peace he said he wants peace 
in that house 
it was 1963 when a young congressman met a young developer over 
a cup of coffee they shared their dreams and began walking toward 
them together 
we were young lions young turks said mallick sighing as 
he looked around his spacious office lined with civic awards 
i did great and he did well mallick continued 
mallick said he never asked wright to vote a certain way on any 
legislation nor did he ask him to intercede with any federal agency 
not that i wouldnt have been entitled to he said im a 
constituent like anyone else 
the fort worth developer said he expects wright to do well in 
the future although it may not necessarily be in a political 
position 
you havent seen the last of him mallick said the mans 
met world leaders he speaks fluent spanish therell be a call to 
him 
mallick added history will treat him well its not over 
hes just going to pause awhile

radical environmental groups founder and three other people on 
charges they conspired to sabotage two nuclear power plants and an 
energy department bomb factory 
the four and possibly a few others who dubbed themselves the 
evan mecham ecoterrorist international conspiracy were plotting 
the undertaking when they were arrested wednesday the fbi and a 
us prosecutor said at a news conference 
this investigation is continuing in arizona and in several 
other states and additional arrests are anticipated said david 
small fbi supervisory special agent here 
he declined to tell reporters when other arrests might be 
expected or how many 
david foreman 42 who in 1979 founded earth first the 
exclamation point is part of the name was arrested in tucson on a 
charge of conspiracy he appeared before a federal magistrate and 
was ordered held without bond 
the three others appeared in phoenix and were ordered held for 
an appearance friday in us district court 
mark l davis 39 marc a baker 37 and margaret katherine 
millett 35 all of prescott were charged with conspiracy to 
sabotage a nuclear plant as well as destruction of an energy 
facility destruction of property used in interstate commerce and 
destruction of government property 
the fbi said davis and baker were arrested while trying to cut 
down a utility pole supporting a power line that links an 
electrical substation with two irrigation pumping stations of the 
central arizona project a multibilliondollar canal system 
bringing colorado river water to phoenix and tucson 
the group which took its name from the former arizona governor 
impeached last year has claimed responsibility for criminal acts

coconino county sheriff joe richards said emetic took credit for 
attempts in october 1987 and october 1988 to saw through a support 
pylon at the fairfield snow bowl near flagstaff 
this is a significant case i think this is a significant 
development in law enforcement it was a very coordinated effort 
over a long period of time mcnamee said 
theyre trying to make it a significant case said nancy 
zierenberg an earth first member in tucson

said she would just as soon forget it despite the citys efforts 
to commemorate the 100th anniversary of one of the nations worst 
natural disasters 
you dont like to remember things like that too long 
106yearold elsie frum said wednesday you know you were there 
you wonder why 
mrs frum was 6 when she and her family fled to a hilltop and 
watched a wall of water roar through johnstown on may 31 1889 
killing 2209 people 
the sharpest memory i have of the flood is running from it 
she said my dad ran into the house and grabbed me and my 
sisters 
mrs frum and the only other known survivor 100yearold frank 
shomo were honored wednesday evening at the citys annual flood 
survivors banquet 
earlier in the day thousands of residents and visitors attended 
dedications rededications and other events commemorating the 
flood the first and worst of three major floods to devastate this 
city in the last century others occurred in 1936 and 1977 
its time to honor those who perished in the past said 
mayor herbert pfuhl jr were celebrating not a flood or a 
disaster but the resiliency of the community 
johnstowners determination was evident in the first hours after 
the flood when they immediately began clearing debris and 
rebuilding the city said richard dill director of centennial 
activities 
thats really the story of johnstown dill said 
scores of people gathered in grandview cemetery in westmont a 
mountain suburb above the city for a prayer vigil at the graves of 
nearly 700 unidentified flood victims 
at 407 pm the time the waters slammed into the city 
hundreds gathered at the confluence of johnstowns three rivers to 
hear a modern diesel locomotive recreate the heroic dash by 
pennsylvania railroad engineer john hess who steamed into the city 
with his whistle tied down as a lastminute warning 
organizers had scheduled a moment of silence with church bells 
ringing as a cue but it was interrupted by a conrail freight train 
passing through 
still those present reflected on the disaster 
i think somewhere in the back of everybodys minds there are 
those 2200 people who perished said chris butcher 24 of 
nearby williamsburg 
later pfuhl and lt gov mark singel lighted a torch that is 
meant to become an eternal flame at the rivers confluence 
the national park service dedicated a 5 million visitors 
center at the site of the dam that unleashed the flood and the 
city rededicated the renovated johnstown flood museum 
the summerlong commemoration under the theme a triumph of 
the human spirit highlights the citys comebacks from disaster 
and economic adversity 
the flood occurred after days of rain when the earthen south 
fork dam collapsed and unleashed 20 million tons of water from a 
reservoir that was an exclusive summer resort for millionaire 
industrialists andrew carnegie henry clay frick and andrew mellon 
among others 
a wall of water up to 70 feet high barreled 14 miles down the 
narrow meandering little conemaugh river valley sweeping away 
early steel mills woodframe homes and barns livestock and people 
in an hour the flood thundered into this bustling city 
crushing scores of homes and downtown businesses in a vast 
whirlpool that lasted 10 minutes 
the city then with about 10000 people suffered an estimated 
17 million in damage at a time the average weekly wage was 10 a 
worldwide relief effort led by clara barton and her new american 
red cross helped to rebuild 
the nations only worse natural disaster was a 1900 hurricane 
that claimed about 6000 lives in galveston texas 
heavy rain in the allegheny mountains caused floods that killed 
25 people 1936 and 80 people in 1977 
stung by declines in the steel industry johnstowns 
unemployment rate peaked at 266 percent in 1983 at the same time 
it had the nations lowest crime rate 
the city now has about 35000 people and the areas

a 17yearold whose wife is pregnant 
says an antitruancy law has taken away his livelihood as well as 
his license so he plans to take the matter to court with the help 
of his father 
one attorney has predicted that if michael means and his father 
william go through with their lawsuit the ruling will set a 
precedent 
under an education reform law passed by the west virginia 
legislature last summer students under age 18 who miss more than 
10 consecutive days or have 15 unexcused absences must give up 
their driving privileges county school systems notify the 
department of motor vehicles of students who have dropped out 
the measure was the nations first antitruancy law to include 
revoking teenagers drivers licenses 
the law is fair for 16yearolds and for most people 
people who are not married said means who lost his job as a 
charleston gas attendant after his driving privileges were taken 
away 
but for many i dont think it should be the same if you 
break the law you pay like an adult so why not be able to drive 
like an adult 
lawmakers in wisconsin and california approved similar laws but 
gov george deukmejian vetoed californias version on wednesday a 
kentucky legislator introduced a similar bill in that state 
our first step will go through the circuit court to see if we 
cant get this law declared unconstitutional said william means 
department lawyer tom madden said if means and his son file the 
suit it will be the first court test of the law and will set a 
standard 
i think this might be a case of first impression i dont want 
to go out on a limb but this may be the first case in the country 
it will definitely be the first time it reaches this stage in west 
virginia madden said 
means dropped out of roosevelt junior high school in kanawha 
county a year ago when he was in ninth grade he and his wife 
tonya 16 are expecting their first child in the fall 
means got a license before dropping out and worked as a gas 
station attendant but he misplaced his license in october and had 
to quit when the state wouldnt replace it because he was a 
dropout on tuesday the dmv affirmed its decision 
there were supposed to be exceptions to this law means 
father said my son is married hes an expectant father with the 
baby due in september they have a house on their own trying to 
make it on their own 
with the decision i see no way for him to gain employment and 
support his family if this isnt an exception i dont know what 
is 
madden said the law allows for hardship cases when the 
withdraw is beyond the control of the student he said that 
decision lies with the counties and not the deparment 
jim simmons associate superintendent of kanawha county pupil 
support services said the county tries to help the students on an 
individual basis 
there was an opportunity in this situation for the student to 
finish his education simmons said 
last year 174 percent of west virginias high school students 
dropped out and in kanawha county 148 percent left early

american office workers are becoming 
more frustrated with their jobs and less trusting of management 
according to a survey by louis harris 
the 1989 office environment index a survey of office worker 
attitudes found 87 percent of office workers believe honesty and 
ethical behavior of company management are the most important job 
characteristics 
only 39 percent think their organizations management met those 
standards when dealing with employees according to the survey 
released wednesday 
office workers plain just dont trust management to deal 
fairly with employees said harris who conducted the survey for 
furniture manufacturer steelcase inc of grand rapids 
the telephone survey of 1041 office workers selected at random 
was released in new york 
when unprompted twothirds of those surveyed said salary was 
the most important job characteristic but when presented with a 
list 10 items the first being ethical management were rated as 
very important more often than salary 
our research indicates that the climate of organizational 
restructuring mergers and acquisitions may be contributing to 
workers mistrust of top management harris said 
after honesty workers said the most important job 
characteristics were the opportunity to develop skills the desire 
for management to recognize workers contributions and job security 
the survey which also polled 150 top executives of us 
corporations also found many bosses are out of touch with how 
their employees perceive their jobs 
while 49 percent of the workers surveyed said they are being 
pushed to the wall on productivity and are doing as much work as 
they reasonably can only 21 percent of the top executives shared 
that view 
last year the survey found worker satisfaction up a bit and saw 
signs of a thaw in employeemanagement relations the latest survey 
showed the proportion of office workers who said they were very 
satisfied had declined 5 percentage points to 41 percent 
this year the mood has begun to sour harris said 
other findings include 
the proportion of office workers who see a great deal of 
connection between doing their job well and getting what they most 
want out of life was 56 percent down 3 points from 59 percent 
fiftyeight percent said its very important that an 
organization have a participatory management style but only 24 
percent said thats very true on their current job 
of health concerns 44 percent of the workers said eye strain 
was the most serious problem followed by air quality radiation 
from video display terminals and exposure to hazardous materials 
the survey found that bosses dont really expect the mere 
mortals of the office rankandfile to find their work fulfilling 
and in turn that leaves the bosses without a clue that workers 
productivity might be related to workers job satisfaction and a 
sense of connection between their work and the rest of their 
lives harris said 
the margin of error was 3 percentage points for the survey 
conducted from nov 30 through jan 8

eight miners were reported missing 
after heavy rains triggered landslides at gold mining tunnels in 
the southern philippines officials said today that three people 
were killed in a related fire 
mario luis jacinto regional director of the bureau of mines 
said the incidents occurred tuesday in the mining town of mount 
diwalwal in davao del norte province about 580 miles southeast of 
manila 
jacinto said the rains loosened soil in the area causing 13 
tunnels to collapse he said 135 miners were able to leave the 
tunnels but eight were reported missing 
several manila radio stations and newspapers reported that as 
many as 13 people died and 1000 others were trapped in the 
collapsed tunnels but jacinto could not confirm it 
we talked to a number of survivors and residents in the area 
but they said the number of missing could not be that high 
jacinto said 
the diwalwal mining area had occasionally been hit by caveins 
but most went unreported because miners fear the government will 
halt operations there 
almost simultaneous with the collapse jacinto said mud caused 
a charcoal pit in a blacksmith shop to tumble and ignited a 
threehour fire in a nearby housing area that burned 165 shanties 
and 15 houses 
the fire killed three people and injured nine he added

an altered polio virus displaying part of an 
aids virus protein may one day work as an aids vaccine researchers 
reported today 
when such a polio virus was created and injected it into 
rabbits the animals made blood proteins that stopped aids virus 
infection in the test tube scientists reported 
the study is among several papers on acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome research published in todays issue of the british journal 
nature 
vaccines spur the bodys immune system into creating proteins 
called antibodies that later can attack particular germs several 
aids vaccine strategies are being tried in humans including the 
use of a genetically altered smallpox virus 
a vaccine using an altered polio virus may lead to antibodies in 
such areas as the surface of the vagina where they might 
inactivate the sexually transmitted aids virus before it enters the 
bloodstream study coauthor jeffrey almond said wednesday in a 
telephone interview 
almond of the university of reading in britain and british 
colleagues worked with a type of polio virus that is widely used in 
the oral polio vaccine 
it was altered to display part of an aids virus protein and 
given to rabbits in the test tube antibodies from the rabbits 
blood stopped a variety of aids virus strains from infecting cells 
the result is encouraging and raises our hopes for finding 
an effective aids vaccine said an accompanying editorial by gordon 
ada of johns hopkins university in baltimore 
a second paper dealt with simian immunodeficiency virus called 
siv which causes aidslike disease in monkeys 
researchers said they found that siv from a west african monkey 
called the sooty mangabey is genetically close to hiv2 which 
causes aids in humans in west africa 
hiv2 differs from hiv1 which causes aids in the united states 
researchers suggested that siv from a sooty mangabey or a 
closely related species may have infected a human west african 
within the past 30 years to 40 years and then evolved into hiv2 
but it is possible that the infection went the other way 
instead with hiv2 entering the monkey said the researchers from 
the national institutes of health georgetown university and tulane 
university 
they also stressed that the proposed time of the infection was 
only a rough estimate

a man called the handcuff rapist was 
given a life sentence plus 2715 years by a judge who said no one 
could measure the victims misery 
robert biddings 35 pleaded guilty wednesday to 71 charges of 
rape kidnapping and robbery as well as to 40 similar charges for 
which he was convicted in a jury trial last week 
he gave up his right to appeal with the guilty pleas 
the bottom line is hes going away for a long time said 
franklin county prosecutor michael miller 
biddings is not expected to be eligible for parole for at least 
40 years 
in sentencing biddings franklin county common pleas judge dana 
deshler said he would make no attempt to lecture him adding 
obviously no one will ever be able to measure the amount of 
human misery visited upon these women and girls in terms of terror 
physical harm humiliation no one will ever be able to measure 
that 
i would say to mr biddings that by his conduct over a 
period of years its my view that he has forfeited his right to 
live in a free and civilized society 
public defender james kura said it was biddings decision to 
plead guilty and avoid a second trial 
biddings said nothing in court but in an interview later with 
wbnstv he linked his decision to evidence presented at his first 
trial 
the whole thing was a setup i would have had no chance in 
the second trial he said i feel sorry for what happened 
to the victims but theres nothing i can do to change that 
one victim in the courtroom characterized biddings as a 
disgusting dog who should have been subject to the death 
penalty 
i almost died he doesnt deserve to live the woman told 
reporters 
deshler sentenced biddings to 15 to 25 years in prison on most 
of the charges but he received a mandatory life sentence because 
one of the victims was under 13 years old when she was raped 
biddings received another mandatory 15 years for using a gun in 
five of the attacks 
the attacker was known as the handcuff rapist because of 
restraints used in many of the assaults that occurred from 1984 to 
1988 
biddings was charged with attacks on 35 people but the cases 
were split into two trials the second of which had been scheduled 
for sept 25 in cincinnati

a study of more than 2200 latin american women 
concludes that infection with two varieties of the common papilloma 
virus doubles the usual risk of cervical cancer 
the study is the first major population study to estimate the 
increased risk of cancer in women infected with this common virus 
doctors have known for several years that papilloma viruses are 
associated with cancer of the cervix 
at least 60 different varieties of the papilloma virus have been 
identified some cause common warts while others cause genital 
warts the kinds associated with cervical cancer in this study 
types 16 and 18 are not thought to cause warts but can be spread 
through sexual intercourse and perhaps other means 
the study was conducted in panama costa rica columbia and 
mexico cervical cancer is far more common in these countries than 
in the united states where the disease strikes about 13000 women 
annually 
it found that genes from the two types of papilloma virus had 
become incorporated into the tissue of 62 percent of the women with 
cervical cancer compared with 32 percent of a healthy comparison 
group 
the researchers calculated that the presence of these virus 
genes was associated with double the usual risk of cancer 
our study shows a strong association but not as strong as we 
would have originally hypothesized said dr louise a brinton of 
the national cancer institute the high rate of detection in 
normal women was an unexpected finding 
the study conducted on 759 women with invasive cervical cancer 
and 1467 randomly chosen healthy women was directed by dr 
william c reeves of gorgas memorial laboratory in panama it was 
published in todays new england journal of medicine 
dr stephen curry of new england medical center in boston noted 
that five other types of papilloma virus 31 33 35 42 and 56 
also are associated with cervical cancer evidence of one of the 
seven types is found in almost all cervical tumors 
the problem is that 40 to 65 percent of women in this country 
have other papilloma viruses present that are not precancerous but 
are causing a great deal of concern curry said they dont do 
anything but cause warts 
contrary to common belief the types of papilloma viruses that 
cause genital and common warts are not linked with cancer 
experts note that in the united states cervical cancer is 
becoming less common largely because of the wide availability of 
pap test which can detect precancerous abnormalities 
curry said that papilloma viruses probably do not cause cancer 
alone but contribute to the disease in combination with some other 
factor such as cigarette smoking or sperm proteins

billy howard says he expected to find anger and 
bitterness among aids sufferers when he began a book of photographs 
and thoughts of people with the deadly disease but it wasnt there 
howard director of photography at emory university traveled 
the nation taking pictures for 18 months for his book epitaphs 
for the living words and images in the time of aids 
the book which is being published soon has 68 photographs and 
handwritten comments by the aids sufferers 
what surprised me the most was the spiritual nature of a lot 
of the comments he said wednesday in a telephone interview 
from new york where he was to appear today for a taping on cbs 
this morning the interview will be broadcast at a later date 
i was surprised how few had a bitter tinge to them at all how 
many said they had discovered so much about themselves while 
dealing with the disease he said 
they were really more concerned about reaching out to other 
people than in eliciting sympathy for what they are going through 
he said word of the project spread usually by word of mouth 
through the aids community and he let people decide to participate 
before he contacted them 
about half of his subjects are from the atlanta area others are 
from washington dc new york chicago and san francisco 
southern methodist university is publishing the book which 
should be on sale in midjune a display of some of the photos 
opens june 5 at the international center of photography in new york 
howard said he got the idea for the book while doing photo 
assignments for emory 
i was looking for a project that was meaningful to me he 
said my dentist had died of aids the year before and i was never 
able to do anything for him this seemed like a positive thing i 
could do 
he said the subjects he photographed had the option of backing 
out of the project up until the time of publication but only a 
couple did so 
people who wanted to participate saw it as a venue to make a 
statement to other people howard said

countless infants are dying of kidney failure 
because their families and physicians dont realize the babies 
could be saved by transplanting a parents organ into them a 
doctor says 
we dont want to coerce any parents to donate but it is a 
proven treatment said dr samuel ks so of the university of 
minnesota hospital 
the major thrust is to let pediatricians and primary care 
physicians know there are options theres hope for these 
children he said wednesday at the annual meeting of the american 
society of transplant physicians 
an estimated 900 children are born every year in the united 
states with kidney failure show twothirds usually die before 
being referred for treatment 
so and colleagues at the hospital have saved 15 such infants 
since 1978 through transplantation three have died 
of the survivors 13 are doing fine with the original graft two 
underwent a second transplant 
most of the recipients achieved normal growth a problem for 
young dialysis and transplant patients so said 
what gives us lots of satisfaction and joy is seeing these 
kids running around and playing just like normal kids he said 
dr gerald arbus associate professor of pediatrics at the 
university of toronto recommends kidney transplants be performed 
on children under age 3 only if the organs come from living 
relatives 
too many lives are being lost and money wasted putting dead 
peoples kidneys into toddlers he said the results are just as 
discouraging when transplants are performed with kidneys from 
braindead children under age 4 he said 
it may be a combination of small grafts into pediatric 
patients that produces this problem said dr steven alexander of 
childrens medical center in dallas 
kidneys that come from living relatives inevitably work better 
than those from dead strangers said dr amir tejani of the state 
university of new york health science center at brooklyn 
livingrelated donors accounted for nearly half the 675 kidney 
transplants reported to the north american pediatric renal 
transplant cooperative study from its inception in january 1987 
through october 1988 tejani said the cooperative represents 70 
centers in north america 
they do very well tejani said on the other hand there 
are some concerns that suggest putting small organs from cadavers 
into another child may not be very good for the small children 
arbus said only a third of 22 patients under age 3 who received 
a kidney from a braindead donor at the hospital for sick children 
in toronto had a functioning organ one year after surgery the 
donors age was irrelevant 
half the 18 children ages 3 to 9 who received a kidney from a 
braindead donor under age 4 enjoyed a oneyear success rate arbus 
said that jumped to 69 percent of the 13 cases in which the kidney 
came from a donor ages 4 to 9 and 77 percent of the 39 cases 
involving donors over age 9 
the results were similar for the 136 recipients over age 9 said 
arbus 
arbus said the problem with tiny kidneys about the size of the 
donors fist is that they are difficult to store safely while a 
recipient is being sought blood clots also tend to form in them 
and they warm up too quickly when inserted 
older cadavers organs do poorly in younger patients because the 
childrens hearts often are too little to handle big kidneys 
younger recipients also show poor tolerance to slightly damaged 
organs 
such factors do not seem to affect the outcome of heart and 
liver transplantation among toddlers doctors said 
with kidney transplants costing 25000 to 30000 each the 
expense of unsuccessful operations can mount quickly arbus said 
dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered by the us and

kimberlyclark swiped at least 300 
million in sales from procter amp gamble by copying its design for 
superabsorbent disposable diapers a lawyer claimed 
attorney allen gerstein gave the estimate in closing arguments 
in procter amp gambles federal lawsuit against its biggest 
competitor 
the company claims the design of its superabsorbent pampers was 
copied by kimberlyclark in developing its superabsorbent huggies 
procter amp gamble wants the judge to order a halt to huggies 
producton and have them removed from stores 
but a lawyer for kimberlyclark said the company had no desire 
to copy pampers because early versions of that product leaked 
kimberlyclark totally independently developed its huggies 
supertrim diapers said the attorney v bryan medlock jr 
barring an outofcourt settlement us district judge falcon 
hawkins is expected to rule this summer in the nonjury case 
procter amp gamble forecast sales of 300 million a year from 
superabsorbent pampers gerstein said but sales were 150 million 
below projections in both fiscal 198687 and the following year 
after kimberlyclark introduced its superabsorbent huggies he 
said 
industry experts say about 33 billion worth of disposable 
diapers are produced each year procter amp gamble is the industry 
leader with about 47 percent of the market and kimberlyclark is 
no 2 with about 30 percent 
the complaint does not seek specific monetary damages if 
kimberlyclark is found liable damages would be determined in a 
second proceeding 
the closing arguments ended 17 days of testimony in the trial 
the complaint by cincinnatibased procter amp gamble says 
researchers paul weisman and steve goldman developed a new way for 
combining wood pulp fluff and superabsorbent materials to allow 
disposable diapers to be made thinner 
kimberlyclark violated the patented process in making its 
superabsorbent huggies the complaint says 
but kimberlyclark contends procter amp gamble never had a valid 
patent because it provided misleading information to the us patent 
office 
the examining officer never would have issued a patent to 
procter amp gamble if he had known about earlier work by an italian 
inventor medlock said 
procter amp gamble said it testmarketed its new superabsorbent 
pampers in wichita kan in 1984 and then kimberlyclark copied 
the design 
medlock also argued that procter amp gamble had not proven a link 
between the invention and the success of the new products 
there is no way to tell whether the success of these other 
products is due to the weismangoldman invention or other 
inventions medlock added 
but gerstein said the weismangoldman development ran contrary 
to the thinking at the time that fluff and superabsorbent material 
could not be combined in a diaper 
not one person not one article not one patent had shown 
that it could be done he said

researchers including two soviet 
scientists intend to sample the sea and air off washingtons 
northern coast seeking evidence that the earth may have natural 
defenses against the greenhouse effect 
the 38member pacific stratus investigation scheduled to begin 
today will combine three aircraft a seagoing research vessel 
shorebased observations and satellite data to determine if the 
global warming effect caused by carbon dioxide and other gases has 
an effect on cloud formation 
the eight us and two soviet organizations involved want to see 
if the earths higher temperature leads to greater release by sea 
plankton of sulfur gases that rise to form the nuclei of clouds 
the scientists hope to gather enough data during the next 10 
days to allow them to simulate cloud formation in scientific models 
used to recreate the greenhouse effect cloud formation is a key 
parameter absent in current models 
the initial results will be discussed next fall among the 
researchers and a second sampling effort is scheduled for april 
1990 
it is possible the earth has a natural thermostat built in 
that would reduce the temperature naturally project member peter 
hobbs professor of atmospheric sciences at the university of 
washington told reporters wednesday 
if the earths temperature warms plankton activity might 
increase which would mean more droplets in clouds that would 
reflect the suns radiation more and recool the earth he said 
those involved say the research effort will be the first to test 
an idea advanced by different scientists but credited mainly to 
british scientist james lovelock 
the hypothesis holds that earth warming could increase the 
activity of phytoplankton which release sulfur gases that rise and 
condense to form particles called cloud condensation nuclei the 
seeds of clouds 
more gases could mean more clouds and this could mean more 
natural blocking of the sun and a cooling effect that could 
compensate for the warming caused by heat retained by excessive 
carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere 
initial data show the opposite may be true that the higher 
temperature could be slowing phytoplankton activity speeding up 
the greenhouse effect 
university of washington atmospheric chemist robert charlson 
performing tests in france found that more sulfur was present 
during the last ice age than during warmer times indicating that 
the phytoplankton may have accentuated the temperature changes 
rather than counterbalancing them 
we dont know if a change in the activity of the phytoplankton 
will change the radiative properties of clouds hobbs said 
the soviets are experts on particle distributions in air and 
dimethylsulfide the gas emitted by the phytoplankton that rises to 
form cloud condensation nuclei 
the immediate aim of the effort is to measure the concentration 
of planktonemitted gases in the oceans surface waters and at 
various altitudes above it 
this data would then allow scientists to factor cloud formation 
data into global climate models

cardinal john oconnor said he canceled a visit 
to meet moslem leaders in west beirut because of a warning that he 
might be kidnapped and taken hostage 
at a news conference at kennedy international airport upon his 
return to the united states on wednesday the cardinal called his 
threeday visit to lebanon a success because it focused attention 
on the fighting there 
he called for a vaticansponsored peace conference supported by 
the united states and other major powers to end the fighting and 
said pope john paul ii had agreed to support the idea 
oconnor said he began receiving messages saturday that some 
very special circumstances had developed making it clear it 
would have been too dangerous for him to travel to west beirut 
i was finally convinced at that point that it would not be 
worth the risk especially of being taken hostage he said 
oconnor said stories in lebanese newspapers that moslem leaders 
were angered by his decision to cancel the visit were inaccurate 
the cardinal said selim hoss prime minister of the moslem 
government of lebanon had agreed he made the right decision the 
moslem government is being challenged by a christian cabinet 
oconnor said he hoped the bush administration would support a 
vaticansponsored peace conference and said israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir and hoss had reacted favorably to the idea 
oconnor said his unsuccessful attempt to find out where the 
western hostages are being held was one failure of the trip he 
said people who had provided information in the past could tell him 
nothing about the hostages 
they said its as if they have vanished into thin air he 
said

city leaders today expanded martial law 
restrictions on reporting by foreign correspondents saying they 
may not cover student protesters and that news coverage in beijing 
must receive prior approval 
in a stern warning city spokesman ding weijun also said foreign 
reporters may not invite chinese citizens to their offices 
residences or hotels for interviews on activities prohibited 
under martial law 
dings statement read at a weekly foreign ministry briefing 
elaborated on martial law regulations banning foreign news coverage 
of the studentled prodemocracy movement 
the foreign correspondents club denounced the expanded rules as 
censorship and harassment 
premier li peng declared martial law in beijing on may 20 in an 
attempt to crush the prodemocracy movement which began in 
midapril with student marches and class boycotts and has 
galvanized the nation 
defying martial law beijing have prevented troops from entering 
the city and nearly 10000 students continue their occupation of 
tiananmen square the symbolic center of power 
martial law restrictions barring foreign reporters from 
interviewing demonstrators have been widely ignored 
ding said press coverage in beijing by foreign journalists or 
journalists from hong kong macao and taiwan is subjected to prior 
application for approval by the city foreign affairs office 
the broad statement indicated that all news coverage not only 
that relating to the demonstrations must be approved first 
coverage of martial law troops including taking photos and 
videotapes is banned and reporting in a disguised form such 
as meeting chinese participating in the democratic movement in 
hotels offices or residences is outlawed 
journalists were also told they should not acquire by unjust 
means materials of an instigative or agitative nature 
ding said the beijing government reserves the right to interpret 
the decrees as it sees fit and that the decrees take precedence 
over other existing regulations 
the foreign correspondents club of beijing in a statement said 
it strongly protests the martial law restrictions on 
journalists calling them a deplorable case of press censorship 
and harassment 
the statement said the ban on coverage calls into question 
chinas policy of openness to the outside world and urged beijing 
authorities to rescind the regulations 
beijingbased foreign journalists and hundreds of journalists 
from outside china covering the popular uprising so far have faced 
only isolated obstacles 
foreign tv crews have had to deal with periods of not being 
allowed to transmit by satellite and some chineselanguage 
frequencies of the usgovernmentfinanced voice of america have 
been jammed 
there has been no official attempt to keep journalists off 
tiananmen square or away from student activists 
however in the past several days at least two us television 
network representatives and a japanese network were warned by 
police that their crews were violating martial law regulations and 
told they were to cease all unauthorized reporting 
a correspondent for the japanese daily yomiuri shimbun was also 
summoned for a warning and today the british broadcasting corp 
was also called in by police 
in no case have specific threats been made ding also said 
nothing specific about penalties only that violations will be 
dealt with in light of the seriousness of the individual case 
at dawn today about 300 peoples liberation army troops marched 
down beijings main avenue near tiananmen square chanting a 
military song 
it was the second straight day that the military had appeared in 
force on city streets on wednesday a large convoy of military 
motorcycles with sidecars roared through the capital 
i think they were just sent to try and scare us said wang 
di a sophomore from the beijing journalism institute but i 
dont think anyone was scared they didnt come that close and not 
many students knew they were there 
students have refused to leave the square until the government 
answers their demands for reforms including a free press and an end 
to official corruption 
government hardliners including premier li and senior leader 
deng xiaoping have demanded the democracy movement be suppressed 
they reportedly ousted from power communist party chief zhao 
ziyang considered a student sympathizer 
on wednesday night students put up tents around their 33foot 
goddess of democracy to prevent any government attempt to 
remove it 
the government says the statue a replica of the statue of 
liberty insults the chinese people and demanded it be removed by 
today the plastic foam statue of a robed woman holding aloft a 
torch was unveiled by students tuesday 
the statue faces the gate to the forbidden city and 
revolutionary leader mao tsetungs portrait 
thursday came and its still here said a student from wuhan 
maritime industrial institute our revolution will endure

a fugitive sought for 17 years on charges of 
supervising heroin distribution as part of the notorious french 
connection drug network was arrested at a hospital here 
stanton garland 60 was arrested wednesday by federal marshals 
at the meadowbrook neurological center in los angeles where he was 
visiting his son deputy marshal ernest santoscoy said 
federal authorities have been searching for garland since he 
disappeared in new york on sept 26 1972 while facing a possible 
20year sentence for heroin distribution at the time garland was 
testifying against other members of a ring that allegedly imported 
heroin from marseilles france 
the case which broke in 1962 with the confiscation of 120 
pounds of almost pure heroin became the basis of the 1971 academy 
awardwinning film the french connection 
our understanding is he was the major distributor for 
harlem said david oflaherty the deputy us marshal in 
brooklyn who supervised the manhunt 
garland went to the hospital to pick up his son lonnie who was 
seriously injured in an automobile accident in february and was to 
be released wednesday the day his health insurance expired 
santoscoy said 
marshals staked out the hospital after the monitoring of 
telephone calls to garlands family found people were being 
directed to the hospital los angelesbased deputies then 
determined that patient lonnie garland was the fugitives son 
santoscoy said 
marshals arrested garland outside the hospital after an 
administrator took him outside on the pretext of discussing his 
sons records privately 
we just walked up very quietly to him and we just basically 
said mr garland youre under arrest said marshal robert 
grossman who made the arrest with santoscoy 
he stopped talking basically he knew the jig had been had 
and that was it 
garland was being held on a charge of escape from the eastern 
district in brooklyn 
us magistrate robert stone tentatively scheduled a june 9 
hearing on a request for garlands extradition to new york

palestine liberation organization chairman yasser 
arafat has ordered the establishment of a 3500member palestinian 
army in south lebanon janes defense weekly reported today 
the force is to become the core of a regular army of an 
independent palestine of the future the londonbased military 
affairs magazine said 
it is intended to replace the existing chaos of assorted 
unruly militias most of them affiliated with arab countries and 
not always friendly to arafat janes said 
the magazine said arafat sent his handpicked military commanders 
to south lebanon in february to serve notice that parttime militia 
salaries were to be reduced and eventually stopped 
fighters and militiamen of all factions could volunteer for 
the palestine army with the understanding that applications would 
be subject to arafats personal approval janes said 
it said the affected militiamen protested strongly and at times 
violently because the economic crisis in lebanon provides no other 
outside employment it said the militia system provides a 
livelihood for about 10000 men in south lebanon refugee camps 
alone 
janes said that because of the protests arafat told his staff 
in the fatah militia to postpone the salary cuts for the time being 
top fatah officers graduates of indian pakistani and east 
bloc military academies and those who have served with the 
jordanian army are now in lebanon running training courses in the 
vicinity of miyeh miyeh village east of the south lebanese port of 
sidon it reported 
it said that on may 19 about 200 palestinians completed basic 
training at the rashediyeh refugee camp south of tyre 
janes said that as arafats wellequipped and wellfinanced 
army takes shape officers serving with other palestinian 
factions have been enlisting including naif hawatmes democratic 
front for the liberation of palestine and george habashs popular 
front for the liberation of palestine pflp 
although leaders of both these factions have been recently 
critical of arafats moves a pflp official said they have no 
objection to their officers joining the palestinian army and their 
departure will not affect their guerrilla operations janes said 
it said arafat currently controls about 2000 fulltime trained 
fighters and about 7500 parttime militiamen in south lebanon 
about 1000 more fighters and 2500 militiamen are controlled 
by other factions including virulently antiarafat pflpgeneral 
command of ahmed jibril and abu nidals fatah revolutionary 
council it said 
janes said all the factions have been acquiring arms but 
arafats fatah is far ahead 
weapons hidden in caches during israels 198285 lebanon 
invasion and occupation have been issued to the militiamen and 
refugee camp guards or made available to potential lebanese 
allies it said 
fatah regulars now constituting the bulk of the palestine 
army have been reequipped with brand new kalashnikov rifles 
energa antiarmor and antipersonnel rifle grenades and rpg7s 
rocketpropelled grenade as personal weapons it said 
zsu 234 antiaircraft guns 81 and 120mm mortars 106mm 
recoilless rifles 107mm multiple rocket launchers and sam7 
strella heatseeking surfacetoair missiles are the heavy 
weapons

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has 
called president bushs disarmament proposals basically positive 
but says he doubts an agreement can be reached within a year on 
reducing troop levels in europe 
bush has called for accord on the reductions within 12 months 
speaking to reporters at the airport before leaving for moscow 
on wednesday shevardnadze said the presence of british and french 
units in europe could complicate the bush proposals the 
conservative french newspaper le figaro reported today 
i want to emphasize that the british and french forces in west 
germany represent 100000 men and this creates an imbalance he 
said 
shevardnadze also said he was disappointed by the natos 
declaration at its brussels summit this week that it favors 
delaying talks on reducing shortrange nuclear missile arsenals in 
europe until a conventional arms accord is completed and put into 
effect 
during the north atlantic treaty organization meeting bush 
proposed a cut in us and soviet troops in europe to 275000 each 
this would mean a 10 percent reduction for the united states but a 
reduction of more than half for the soviets 
shevardnadze was in paris to attend a human rights conference 
and before leaving met with foreign minister roland dumas to 
discuss the scheduled july 47 visit of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to france

pope john paul ii today began a visit to 
scandinavia a lutheran stronghold with fewer roman catholics than 
normally turn out to hear him on holidays in st peters square 
the pope emerged from his special alitalia jetliner and knelt to 
kiss the ground his custom in his 41 previous foreign tours 
whenever reaching a country he has never visited before 
besides the stop in norway the popes 10day tour also will 
take him to iceland finland denmark and sweden 
the pontiff was welcomed by norways lutheran bishops officials 
of the tiny catholic church in norway and by prime minister gro 
harlem brundtland 
the pope said he came to scandinavia as a brother deeply 
concerned with the wellbeing of his brothers and sisters in every 
part of the world i come to norway as a friend full of esteem and 
love for its noble people and its millenary christian heritage 
in a brief welcome speech on the tarmac mrs brundtland praised 
the pontiff for his important role as a mediator and arbitrator 
in international affairs 
she said the popes efforts to increase dialogue were crucial 
for promoting mutual understanding between people from different 
cultures 
on his flight from rome the pope was asked by norwegian 
reporters about reports that some lutheran bishops were unhappy 
about the visit 
he said the church and i personally are undertaking an 
ecumenical meeting certainly not all the lutheran bishops share 
this ecumenical path as sometimes some catholics also have 
trouble with it 
one norwegian lutheran bishop is refusing to attend a joint 
prayer service in trondheim on friday 
john paul who is known as an avid sportsman also was asked if 
he had brought his skis to norway and he responded tying the 
issue to his mission 
ive been told that the best solution for ecumenism and for 
the rapproachment of the churches would be if the pope the king of 
sweden or the king of norway could go skiing together 
john paul will give more than 30 speeches as he travels across 
the land of the midnight sun and north of the arctic circle 
preaching to a flock that by vatican count numbers 197000 or less 
than 1 percent of the population 
but he will always have a wider that is lutheran audience 
in mind said vatican spokesman joaquin navarro 
the schedule for the start of the trip includes meetings with 
king olav v and mrs brundtland and the first of a series of 
ecumenical encounters 
never before in his 10year papacy has john paul visited a 
christian region with so few catholics evidence of his intent to 
bring romes message to every country of the world 
scandinavia is an area where the 16thcentury protestant 
reformation swept away roman catholicism where the lutheran church 
is associated with the state and catholicism was outlawed until a 
century ago 
in copenhagen john paul will attend a prayer service but not 
speak at the request of the lutheran church he is also expected to 
refrain from a display of the symbols of papal authority as he did 
when he did not wear his miter during a historic visit to a 
lutheran church in rome in 1983 
it was the first time the pope had visited the church founded by 
theleader of the reformation the german monk martin luther 
luther was excommunicated by rome in 1521 for attacking 
widespread views that salvation could be earned by good works such 
as paying for masses and indulgences to avert penalities in 
purgatory 
throughout the trip john paul is expected to stress christian 
ethics in the affluent societies where religion appears to play a 
very small role bolster the morale of the catholics and signal his 
interest in moving ahead relations with the lutherans 
the highly developed countries are overwhelmingly secular and 
attitudes toward marriage birth control and abortion are in sharp 
contrast to the teaching of the roman catholic church 
but scandinavian catholic leaders take affront at depictions of 
scandinavia as a center of sin often associated with easy sex and 
pornography 
the osservatore romano the vatican daily newspaper has 
written that we live in a pool of immorality what nonsense 
helsinki bishop paul verschuren told the religious affairs monthly 
30 days 
only in the past 100 years has the church emerged from centuries 
of of repression for a brief period in denmark being catholic was 
a capital offense a 1952 swedish law guaranteed freedom of 
religion but it wasnt until 1977 that the final law against 
catholicism was stricken from the books when it became legal to 
build a monastery

when he went out with me he was confident

these events saying that wilson and she saw radins limousine make 
a right turn followed by a car full of men but wilson decided not

archbishop desmond tutu and 
other antiapartheid church leaders today urged foreign bankers to 
refuse to reschedule south africas debt payments unless the 
government makes major political concessions 
an interim debt agreement expires on june 30 1990 and south 
africas whitecontrolled government is faced with payments of at 
least 8 billion by 1991 unless new terms are established 
the four clergymen said bankers should negotiate a new agreement 
only in exchange for government promises to lift the state of 
emergency free political prisoners lift bans on opposition 
groups repeal discriminatory laws and begin talks on granting full 
political rights to blacks 
without such linkage rescheduling will amount to an extension 
of time and credit to the apartheid regime to continue brutalizing 
the oppressed majority in south africa said a letter released by 
the south african council of churches 
the letter was signed by tutu the first black leader of the 
anglican church in southern africa the rev frank chikane black 
generalsecretary of the church council the rev allan boesak 
mixedrace president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
and the rev beyers naude a veteran white antiapartheid activist 
the clergymen also recommended that trade credits to south 
africa be suspended and that banks halt gold loans in which south 
africa uses its gold reserves as collateral 
two weeks ago the head of the reserve bank of south africa 
gerhard de kock warned that the countrys economy faced stagnation 
unless there was adequate progress in the field of political and 
constitutional reform 
his cautiously worded speech was viewed as confirmation that a 
4yearold freeze on new loans to south africa has seriously harmed 
the economy since 1985 several billion dollars has left south 
africa without replacement to pay off old debts and purchase 
imports 
since de kocks speech the economy has been battered even 
further by the falling price of gold by far the countrys most 
important export 
the loan freeze has had more impact on south africa than other 
forms of economic sanctions most foreign companies which have 
withdrawn from south africa have sold their holdings at favorable 
terms to local executives and exports of coal steel and farm 
produce have been sustained despite embargoes by the us and some 
western european countries 
tutu and his colleagues have been criticized harshly by whites 
and conservative blacks for their advocacy of sanctions the 
critics claim sanctions will harden white attitudes while causing 
harm primarily to poor blacks 
the four antiapartheid leaders on a visit to the united states 
earlier this month launched a new campaign seeking to target 
economic pressure more specifically 
we did not go to washington to ask for more sanctions 
tutu said in a speech wednesday night we went to ask for help to 
get negotiations going that would bring an end to apartheid and to 
usher in the new south africa

israel has jailed at least 5000 palestinians 
without trial since the uprising began many of them nonviolent 
opponents kept in harsh conditions and deprived of adequate legal 
counsel amnesty international says 
in a report released today the londonbased human rights 
movement says most of the socalled administrative detainees 
are held in tents that give little protection from desert 
conditions 
amnesty said israels use of administrative detention or 
imprisonment without trial for nonviolent opponents violates 
fundamental human rights 
it called for all administrative detentions to be urgently 
reviewed with prisoners held for nonviolent activity to be 
released immediately and unconditionally 
israel denied its army was violating the human rights of 
nonviolent opponents people are being held because of violent 
activities not because of their ideas avi pazner an aide to 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said in jerusalem israel does not 
use administrative detention lightly 
amnesty says most detainees are held for six months and that at 
least 1100 palestinians are in administrative detention most of 
them at ketziot detention center in the negev desert 
accommodations are poor consisting of tents that give little 
protection from desert temperatures and rain medical services are 
inadequate family visits are restricted the camp is overcrowded 
and there are thricedaily roll calls regarded by most detainees 
as a form of punishment the report says 
it also mentions the seemingly arbitrary use of solitary 
confinement and enforced standing and the repeated and 
possibly unjustified use of tear gas and firearms within the camp 
some administrative detainees seem to have been held illegally 
as court orders for their release or for reduction of their 
detention have apparently been disregarded by the camp 
authorities the report says 
there have been several riots and a hunger strike and the 
israeli high court has criticized conditions in ketziot 
recommending that a committee headed by a military judge be set up 
to monitor conditions amnesty said 
as of april no committee had been set up it added 
the israelis inherited powers of administrative detention from 
the british who ruled the land until 1948 and assert that it is 
warranted by the special security situation and the danger the 
state suffers from terrorism amnesty said it acknowledged that 
detentions fell sharply in the late 1970s from 1130 in 1970 to 20 
or 30 in 1978 
but it said the practice has become widespread since the 
intefadeh or uprising begain in the israelioccupied west bank 
and gaza strip in december 1987 
it is now used against all sections of palestinian society 
laborers and the unemployed trade unionists students 
journalists doctors lawyers academics teachers members of 
voluntary organizations and human rights workers the amnesty 
report says 
it says that in march 1988 israel abolished the detainees 
right to prompt automatic review of their arrest and empowered 
officers down to the rank of colonel to issue sixmonth detention 
orders 
detainees have since had to wait weeks or even months for an 
appeal hearing and their lawyers are denied sufficient specific 
information to challenge the detention order it says 
the report says israeli authorities distinguish between those 
who have and those who have not committed acts of violence but 
ignore the distinction if they believe the activity is political 
subversion that threatens security 
amnesty rejects the israeli view that anyone who supports or 
campaigns for the palestine liberation organization automatically 
supports violence 
it recognizes that plo factions carry out both violent and 
nonviolent protest and believes that a person can support the 
plo without themselves espousing or engaging in violence 
the report says israels existing procedures for reviewing cases 
of imprisonment without trial are insufficient to prevent abuse 
of the detainees right to challenge the detention particularly 
their right to be informed promptly and fully of the reasons for 
their detention 
also judges show an apparent reluctance to question 
evidence provided by the secret services or to challenge the 
authorities when they say information is being withheld from the 
detainee because it is classified the report says 
it suggests israel abolish the measure altogether or at least 
review the grounds on which detention orders are issued and give 
the detainee immediately upon arrest in writing specific and 
individualized reasons for the arrest

archbishop desmond tutu has called 
on the government to reprieve all prisoners on death row including 
a white extremist sentenced to hang for killing seven blacks and an 
indian man 
speaking at a church meeting wednesday night the black anglican 
leader called for abolition of the death penalty and an amnesty for 
the more than 200 prisoners on death row 
i include even barend strydom who is a child and product fed 
on the hatred and contempt that are the logical consequences of 
apartheid said tutu referring to the 23yearold former 
policeman condemned in pretoria supreme court last week 
strydom who testified that he considered blacks to be animals 
shot and killed seven people and wounded 16 blacks during a 
shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown pretoria in november 
a week earlier he killed one black woman and wounded another at 
a squatter camp in what he described as a practice attack 
in calling for reprieves tutu mentioned the socalled upington 
14 a black woman and 13 black men sentenced last week to hang for 
complicity in the mob killing of a black policeman during township 
unrest in 1985 only one of the 14 was found to have contributed 
physically to the death pf the policeman 
it makes you shudder that we can sentence 14 people to death 
at one fell swoop said tutu that includes a lady of 60 years 
of age

upwardly mobile roof rats who prefer 
californias newer neighborhoods are invading pricey homes using 
newly planted vines and trees as an aboveground freeway health 
officials said 
twice during the past two weeks wrecker rats have driven lance 
finkel out of his home in oaklands montclair district a 
neighborhood of 300000plus houses in the hills overlooking the 
city 
theyre chewing the house apart said finkel theyre 
chewing up the doors and pulling the carpet up theyve chewed 
through the bottom of an armoire theyre driving me out of the 
house 
even an exterminator wasnt able to solve the problem for 
finkel who is hoping alameda countys vector control unit can stop 
the infestation 
the baby boom among roof rats is keeping pace with californias 
population rise which saw the number of residents jump 662000 to 
283 million this year 
the rodents which use telephone lines and overhanging trees to 
travel from city to suburb are moving in where there was never a 
problem before health officials said 
theres a lot of development taking place all over the state 
and all these developments are putting in new landscaping as it 
matures this vegetation provides ideal habitat for roof rats 
said richard yercott a state health department biologist 
complaints about norway sewer rats the larger more aggressive 
cousin found in city slums and waterfronts used to dominate rat 
complaints in oakland and the adjacent suburban counties but not 
any more 
for years the norways were the prevailing animals but i think 
the roof rat is quickly catching up said john chase a 
technician in contra costa countys rodent control unit chase says 
50 percent of his offices calls are about roof rats now 
alameda county roof rat complaints have increased 50 percent 
during the past five years particularly in oaklands hill areas 
said harry scott manager of alameda countys vector control 
district 
sometimes the rats come indoors they suddenly get curious and 
invade a home and thats when the real trouble begins scott said 
one oakland hills resident called scotts office when roof rats 
scurrying through his house set off the motion detector in his home 
security system 
in pleasant hill a resident had so many nesting roof rats in 
her wall that they destroyed her insulation and wiring scott said 
roof rats can carry a considerable number of diseasecausing 
parasites and their bites are the biggest worry scott said 
alameda county averages about five rat bite cases a year he said

a faction in the governing liberal democratic party 
today offered its own candidate to succeed prime minister noboru 
takeshita after objecting to the choice of the party leaders 
legislator shizuka kamei said ganri yamashita a former cabinet 
member and political foe of takeshitas would run against foreign 
minister sousuke uno 
on wednesday uno 66 agreed to take the job after leaders in 
the scandaltainted party decided he was the best person for the 
job 
but members of several of the partys major factions opposed uno 
because he is a senior member of the faction of former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone it was during nakasones 198287 tenure 
that the socalled recruit scandal developed 
this is the will of the people who oppose the partys 
decision on mr unos candidacy kamei said we asked mr 
yamashita to stand for us and he said he would 
the 68yearold yamashita said he accepted the offer to run 
share prices slumped on the tokyo stock exchange in part due to 
nervousness about a split in the probusiness liberal democratic 
party dealers said the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues shed 28540 points or 083 percent to finish at 3398135 
yamashita represents the same constituency in shiga prefecture 
as uno he served as directorgeneral of the defense agency under 
prime minister masayoshi ohira in the late 1970s 
kameis liberal progressive alliance has 48 members in the diet 
japans parliament kamei said he would have no trouble getting the 
required 50 signatures to back yamashitas candidacy and force a 
vote between the candidates 
takeshita is resigning to take responsibility for the recruit 
scandal which has stained the top ranks of politics business and 
the bureaucracy the recruit co is an information services 
conglomerate that offered cutrate priced shares to political and 
business leaders allegedly to win favors 
many of the liberal democratic partys top leaders have been 
deemed ineligible for the prime ministers job because they have 
been linked to the scandal 
business leaders welcomed the choice of uno noting he gained 
international experience as foreign minister since november 1987 
and was untainted by the scandal 
the liberal democrats need someone with an untarnished image to 
boost their popularity before elections this summer for half of 
parliaments upper house it took more than a month to find such a 
person after takeshita announced on april 25 that he would resign 
party leaders first approached the partys executive council 
chairman masayoshi ito 75 but he refused the job citing poor 
health and dissatisfaction with the partys handling of reforms

here is a transcript of the remarks of president 
bush and prime minister margaret thatcher thursday to reporters 
outside the prime ministers residence 
president bush 
on behalf of our entire traveling squad she and i talked in 
detail about a wide array of issues and i want to thank her and i 
want to assert here that the special relationship that has existed 
between the unted kingdom and the united states is continuing and 
will continue 
and once again madame prime minister my sincere thanks to you 
for a very encouraging and frank exchange that we had its only 
with friends that you can take off the gloves and talk from the 
heart 
and i felt that i was with a friend today and i can assure the 
people in the united kingdom that from our side of the atlantic 
this relationship is strong and will continue to be 
mrs thatcher 
mr president ladies and gentlemen the president comes here 
after a very very successful nato summit due to the leadership of 
the united states under the presidency of george bush 
we talked about the followup to these matters we talked also 
about the very difficult situation in the middle east we talked 
about the situation in china we talked about matters in south 
africa and we have talked about matters in the argentine and in 
central america and so i think you will agree we have covered an 
extremely wide range of subjects 
and yet the morning has been too short we spoke together for 
about an hour and threequarters and then joined our foreign 
ministers and mr scowcroft and they too had considered some of 
these matters and others 
we then also talked about the problems in cambodia and the 
problems with the vietnamese boat people still going to hong kong 
so you can see that we have compressed a great deal into the 
time we think very much the same way which isnt surprising 
and were absolutely delighted that we have in president bush a 
president of the united states who is staunch and steadfast on 
everything which is of fundamental value to democracy freedom and 
justice and the necessity to keep our countries secure and yet 
forever stretching out the hand of friendship with other nations 
across the european divide trying to extend to the world some of 
the benefits which we enjoy but take for granted 
we are in a period when as the president has said in some of 
his most excellent speeches its the end of containment its 
freedom on the offensive a peaceful offensive throughout the world 
i think they have been some of the most valuable and happy talks 
i have had for a very long time and we thank and congratulate the 
president 
q is britain still americas most important ally in europe 
thatcher i think you might put it more tactfully america has 
allies throughout europe and throughout the free world i would 
like to think that we pride ourselves of being among the foremost 
of the united states friends and we will always be i think its 
quite wrong that because you have one friend you should exclude 
the possibility of other friendships as well and im sure the 
president doesnt and i dont we both have many friends in europe 
bush very good answer 
q mr bush could i ask you do you think that west germany and 
france will increasingly share the spotlight in the socalled 
special relationship you have with mrs thatcher 
bush i think that the special relationship that i referred to 
in my opening remarks speaks for itself and i think the remarks 
that the prime minister just made about her propensity for 
friendship with other nations and the united states friendship 
with other nations those remarks speak for themselves and so i 
would simply say i expect this relationship to continue on the 
steady keel because it is so fundamentally based on common values 
and the nato alliance for example is not going to divide up in 
to inside cliques of who is the closest friend to whom but the 
point i want to make here is i value the judgment the conviction 
the principled stance of prime minister thatcher 
ive been privileged to know her and work with her in for me a 
lesser capacity for eight years and this visit alone as we cross 
many many borders and discuss the problems that face us reassures 
me and just reaffirms what i have always felt that we have a 
very very special relationship but it neednt be at the expense 
of our friendship with other countries 
thatcher just one more one more 
q mr bush what exactly can britain do to bring about this 
further freedom in eastern europe that you said you want to see 
bush well theyve already done one step and that is to help 
nato come out with a very sound proposal 
i can tell you the prime minister and her able foreign minister 
helped shape this whole nato proposal and communique which both of 
us think is a very forwardlooking document adhering to principles 
so its not a question of the future theyve already performed 
since ive been here in the last few days a very useful very 
useful role and there are many other areas where just on bilateral 
basis that im sure the united kingdom can influence and encourage 
this trend to democracy that the prime minister referred to many 
other areas the uk is widely respected in eastern europe 
thatcher thank you i think mrs bush awaits mrs bush awaits 
no that was the last question thank you for coming

a man convicted only of manslaughter 
for shooting his estranged wife a judge to death in her 
courthouse chambers should get the stiffest possible sentence 
angry protesters said 
a thousand people rallied wednesday outside the county hall of 
justice to protest the manslaughter conviction of former police 
officer clarence ratliff in the death of district judge carol 
irons irons who has been described as a supporter of victims of 
family violence was killed last october 
on may 11 a jury acquitted ratliff of firstdegree murder 
which carries a possible sentence of life in prison without parole 
ratliff 53 had testified that he was drunk and upset over their 
impending divorce and did not mean to kill irons who was 40 the 
lesser charge of manslaughter carries a possible sentence of up to 
15 years 
but the jury also convicted the 21year police veteran of 
attempted murder for firing at two officers who tried to help irons 
we are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered less 
serious than shooting at and missing two men said one 
protester dotti clune she described the jurys decision as a 
slaponthehand verdict 
carol irons was not manslaughtered she was murdered said 
another speaker psychologist sherry redding 
more than 1000 letters have been sent to kent county circuit 
judge dennis kolenda urging the maximum allowable prison term at 
ratliffs june 12 sentencing 
attempted murder carries a possible sentence of life in prison 
with possibility of parole but michigan attorney general frank 
kelley has recommended that ratliff be sentenced to 25 to 40 years 
in prison because those sentenced to life can be paroled after 10 
years and those who get 25 to 40 years generally serve at least 20 
years 
the protesters did not specify the sentence they want the judge 
to give but said it should be the harshest possible 
kolenda said he was reading each letter 
a judge has to walk a tightrope he said after the rally 
some decisions must be made by the letter of the law and some 
decisions must take into account community sentiment

four nuns barricaded in their 
monasterys infirmary will continue their eightmonth protest 
against liberalizations in their lifestyle despite a renewed call 
from the vatican to end the standoff 
the paterson diocese announced wednesday that vatican officials 
had rejected the nuns appeal and again ordered them to leave the 
building of the most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel 
however a spokeswoman for the nuns says they will not leave 
the nuns fled to the infirmary on oct 4 saying they feared 
eviction for protesting changes to their monastery such as 
introduction of television and sweets diocese officials said the 
issue was the nuns refusal to obey their prioress mother teresa 
hewitt 
betty sutton spokeswoman for the nuns said the letter from the 
congregation for institutes of consecrated life and societies of 
apostolic life ordering the nuns to leave was an answer to a march 
appeal but an appeal filed in july 1988 on other issues remains 
unanswered and the nuns will not leave the monastery until it is 
she said 
theyre going to go on just the way they have been mrs 
sutton said theres still an appeal out there and theyre still 
going to keep waiting for an answer 
the nuns have said they were awaiting an answer from the 
apostolica signatura the vaticans highest court 
but in a separate letter to bishop frank rodimer bishop of the 
diocese cardinal achille silvestrini prefect of the apostolica 
signatura said there is no recourse pending before this supreme 
tribunal concerning the nuns 
in letters from rome to each of the women the congregation said 
in its most recent ruling the problem has been carefully 
reexamined from all points of view the good of your soul the 
safeguarding of the values of religious life respect for the 
established authority and the witness we have to render to the 
church convinces us to confirm what has been decided 
the excerpt from the letter was made available by timothy 
manning spokesman for the paterson diocese 
manning said there has been no discussion on what to do with the 
nuns if they again refuse to leave the monastery the carmelite 
community could decide to remove them from their vows he said 
the vows of two of the nuns expired during the protest a fifth 
nun left the monastery march 19 citing health reasons

the bottom has fallen out of 
beach wear this summer and thats upsetting people who would 
rather look the other way 
weve had maybe a dozen young women we have asked to cover up 
or leave the beach said city waterfront director norma jean page 
part of her job lately has been to keep the beach free of the 
near nudity of thong or gstring bathing suits which leave the 
bottom bare 
its really no big deal we just tell them we have had a city 
ordinance since 1976 against revealing certain parts of the body 
including the buttocks when they understand that they are very 
nice and leave she said 
the suits are specifically outlawed in north myrtle beach but 
women who sport the skimpy wear have not been fined or hauled off 
to jail just asked to leave the beach 
mark kalb of the pineapple beach surf shop said the trend 
started in earnest last year and the openair suits are even more 
popular this season 
these suits dont appeal to the conservatives although 
everybody pretty much takes a look at them 
south of north myrtle beach in myrtle beach there are no 
specific bans except for outright nudity and few complaints 
about the risque swimsuits 
we looked at the same ordinance north myrtle beach has but 
our biggest problem would be with enforcement said myrtle beach 
city clerk mandy tomz 
there is such a wide area of beach to cover and there are so 
many people on the beach it would be very difficult to pick and 
choose whom to send away and that would not be received well

rep newt gingrich who initiated the 
investigation of speaker jim wright has to be much more 
responsible as house republican whip than he was as a junior 
member gop leader bob michel said today 
everyones free to do their own thing in a sense michel 
said on cbs this morning he pointed out that gingrich rga 
was catapulted into the leadership when thenrep dick cheney 
rwyo was picked as defense secretary 
hes got to be much more responsible than he was as a junior 
member of congress michel said he recognizes that i think 
ive already detected somewhat of a change in his deportment on the 
floor of the house its a learning process for him 
gingrich ducked out of the house chamber without a word to 
reporters after wrights resignation 
gingrich aides said the gop whip decided just before wrights 
speech wednesday that he would not comment he stayed on the house 
floor for nearly an hour to avoid being confronted by reporters 
then left through an undisclosed exit 
gingrich sat next to michel of illinois he sat impassively 
through most of the speech with his hands folded in his lap 
when democrats stood up and broke into applause after wright 
called for an end to this period of mindless cannibalism in the 
house gingrich conferred briefly with michel then grinned and 
joined other republicans in rising 
gingrichs refusal to comment on wrights resignation was in 
sharp contrast to the highprofile ethics campaign he has waged for 
nearly two years against wright and other house democrats 
democrats reacted to his barrage of charges early this year by 
filing their own complaint against gingrich with the house ethics 
committee the complaint which is still pending before the 
committee alleges that gingrich violated house rules with a 
partnership he created in 1984 to promote his book window of 
opportunity

a doctor who specializes in lyme disease 
increasingly finds his waiting room crowded with patients who dont 
have it 
every year we get a new pop disease and you get all these 
stressed out people who think they have it said the doctor who 
practices in the northeast and asked not to be identified a lot 
of them dont have it theyre depressed or have other ills 
he blames it on what might be called the great lyme disease 
scare of 1989 
the news reports began as soon as the weather was nice enough 
for a walk in the woods they warned that lyme disease is marching 
across the country can go undiagnosed and can do serious damage to 
the joints and nervous system 
those frightening assertions are true as far as they go 
but nearly all lyme disease cases are confined to eight hot 
spots in the northeast and midwest most cases are easily cured and 
simple preventive measures can sharply cut the likelihood of 
getting it 
in most of the states only small numbers of cases have been 
reported said dr theodore tsai of the us centers for disease 
control laboratory in fort collins colo 
ninety percent of the nations cases occur in the northeast 
half in new york state and 40 percent in just two counties 
westchester immediately north of new york city and suffolk 
covering the eastern half of long island 
even in those areas the risk can be lowered by wearing insect 
repellent and inspecting for ticks 
its important that people dont feel helpless or powerless in 
the face of this problem and when they do get lyme disease when 
its detected at an early stage most people respond to therapy and 
recover tsai said 
the eight lyme disease hot spots are new york new jersey 
pennsylvania massachusetts connecticut rhode island minnesota 
and wisconsin 
if you live in those areas lyme disease is an immensely 
important problem no question about it but people living 
elsewhere shouldnt get the impression from reading the eastern 
papers that its as big a problem where they live tsai said 
lyme disease was identified in 1975 by dr allen steere then of 
yale university and now of the new england medical center in 
boston the first cases were picked up near old lyme conn 
it soon became clear the disease was spread by ticks found on 
deer mice and other mammals in 1982 researchers discovered it 
was caused by corkscrewshaped bacteria carried by the ticks 
between 1980 and 1988 some 14000 cases were reported in the 
united states according to the cdc the actual numbers may be 
several times that doctors can only guess more than onethird of 
the cases or about 5000 occurred in 1988 the disease is clearly 
on the rise and has been reported in 43 states so it is 
spreading but it remains uncommon outside the hot spots 
much has been made of the serious complications that can 
sometimes arise from lyme disease it can affect the joints and the 
nervous system causing permanent damage if not treated early it 
can be tough to cure requiring extensive treatment with expensive 
intravenous antibiotics 
lyme disease also is the great impostor it can look like 
arthritis flu heart disease palsy and in advanced stages 
alzheimers disease meningitis and multiple sclerosis 
the concern is that the diagnosis might be missed along with 
the chance to treat it when its easily curable some news reports 
have focused on cases in which undiagnosed lyme disease has caused 
crippling nerve and joint damage 
the thing i think is being lost in all of this is that in the 
majority of people this is a pretty benign disease said dr 
raymond dattwyler of the state university of new york in stony 
brook antibiotics can generally clear it up quickly 
diagnosis is not as tricky as its been made out to be he said 
its not a vague disease with aches and pains 
in twothirds of the cases it begins with a characteristic 
bullseye rash a red ring around a clear center it also causes 
specific kinds of nerve and joint damage that doctors can readily 
identify as lyme disease 
furthermore blood tests can usually confirm the diagnosis 
its been talked about that the blood test is not very good 
said steere i think its better than its generally being 
reported in the press 
dattwylers office is in suffolk county where the incidence of 
lyme disease has approximately doubled each year for the past three 
years despite that sharp increase he and his colleagues have cut 
the lyme disease rate in half in employees of nearby fire island 
national seashore 
these are people who work in the brush in one of the most 
highly endemic areas in the world said dattwyler basically 
what we teach them is to recognize what the tick looks like how to 
avoid exposure how to remove the ticks and really stress that you 
do have time before the infection occurs 
ticks must feed for 24 hours to 48 hours in order to transmit 
the infection he said if theyre found and pulled off carefully 
with tweezers or fingers at the end of the day infection is 
unlikely 
people who find ticks on themselves shouldnt rush to the 
doctors to be tested for lyme disease dattwyler said it takes 
four to six weeks to develop antibodies to the lyme disease bug 
and thats when the blood test can show infection it would be 
reasonable to have the test done then he said 
lyme disease is likely to continue its spread and it may 
ultimately become an important disease outside the current hot 
spots 
ticks are probably hitching rides around the country on 
migratory birds and changing land use is putting peoples homes 
closer to the woods and brush where ticks live said tsai 
nevertheless he said the problem has been overblown emphasis 
on problem cases and tough diagnoses has overshadowed what we 
know can be done to prevent it it is more spectacular to talk 
about a mystery disease

the president said today he will ask 
india to withdraw its peacekeeping troops from sri lanka by the end 
of july 
also today suspected sinhalese extremists shot and killed a 
senior police detective and set a bomb that killed a provincial 
city council member 
president ranasinghe premadasa who took office five months ago 
repeatedly has said he wants indias soldiers to withdraw but his 
announcement today was the first time he set a date 
during my election campaign i pledged to ask the indian troops 
to leave this pledge i will keep premadasa told a buddhist 
gathering at a temple in battaramula seven miles southeast of 
colombo 
the first indian force of 3000 soldiers arrived in sri lanka on 
july 30 1987 under a peace plan signed by indian prime minister 
rajiv gandhi and premadasas predecessor julius r jayewardene 
the contingent swelled to 70000 as indian troops tried to 
disarm guerrillas from the tamil hindu minority whose separatist 
war against the sinhalese buddhist majority has claimed 9000 lives 
since 1983 an estimated 45000 indian soldiers are still deployed 
in northern and eastern sri lanka where most tamils live and hope 
to set up a homeland 
i will shortly ask indian prime minister rajiv gandhi to mark 
the second anniversary by totally withdrawing the indian army from 
this country premadasa said 
more than 700 indian soldiers have died in the peacekeeping 
campaign 
premadasa said sri lanka was grateful for the sacrifices made by 
india but he added we will also be grateful if india agrees to 
withdraw its troops from this country 
india has said from the outset of its involvement in sri lanka 
that it had no plans to stay indefinitely india joined the 
conflict under pressure from its own powerful tamil minority of 60 
million 
the 1987 accord led to a violent campaign by the militant 
sinhalese peoples liberation front against the sri lankan 
government which it said made too many concessions to tamils the 
ultranationalist sinhalese have been blamed for 3500 deaths in the 
war 
sinhalese extremists today shot and killed police detective 
bennet perera as his car passed through ratmalana 10 miles from 
the city center police said perera headed a special unit 
investigating the ultranationalists 
in the second incident today sinhalese militants threw a bomb 
at the home of leslie ranagala a governing united national party 
provincial city council member that killing him and his guard 
no group claimed responsibility for the killings 
the tamil guerrilla campaign grew out of the ethnic minoritys 
charges that the sinhalese discriminated against them 
sinhalese who form 75 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
dominate the government and military tamils make up 18 percent of 
the island off southern india formerly known as ceylon 
under premadasa the government has opened negotiations on 
ending the civil war with leaders of the most powerful tamil rebel 
group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the militant 
sinhalese however have refused to particiapte

the 1989 atlantic hurricane season 
which began today should be milder than last years a leading 
storm forecaster says 
colorado state university professor william gray predicted 
wednesday that there would be only four hurricanes and seven 
tropical storms during the season which runs through nov 30 
this will be a belowaverage year in the number of hurricanes 
and they will be less intense gray a teacher of atmospheric 
sciences told a conference of the american meteorological society 
in the last six years gray has made nearperfect predictions 
about the number of hurricanes formed in the atlantic using reams 
of data on such things as ocean temperature patterns 
last year there were six hurricanes including gilbert a 
particularly strong storm that killed more than 300 people and 
wrought heavy damage in the dominican republic haiti jamaica and 
mexico and joan which devastated parts of nicaragua in addition 
there were five tropical storms 
weather disturbances that begin in the tropics are classified as 
tropical storms and given a name when their sustained winds reach 
39 mph they are classified as hurricanes if their winds reach 74 
mph 
during the average atlantic season 10 tropical storms develop 
and six of them become hurricanes 
in coral gables the national hurricane center on wednesday 
released the 21 names that will be given 1989 hurricanes and 
tropical storms in the atlantic 
the names are allison barry chantal dean erin felix 
gabrielle hugo iris jerry karen luis marilyn noel opal 
pablo roxanne sebastien tanya van and wendy 
bob sheets director of the hurricane center cautioned that 
apathy and unfamiliarity with the destructive power of a major 
hurricane could prove fatal 
in his annual hurricane awareness warning wednesday sheets 
said if a major storm strikes a coastal metropolitian center 
this year the risk of fatalities is high because the endangered 
population will face congested evacuation routes insufficient 
escape and too little experience in hurricane survival 
his comments were echoed by other disaster officials who said 
they fear that newcomers to a region and tourists in particular 
sometimes dont take storm warnings seriously enough 
getting people to take hurricanes seriously is the biggest 
problem said rick scofield assistant director of disaster 
services for miamis red cross when a community goes a long time 
without a major storm theyre less sensitive to the danger

the new soviet congress today formed a commission 
to determine whether the kremlin absorbed the three baltic 
republics by force under a secret accord with nazi germany 
the congress acted after president mikhail s gorbachev said the 
issue needs to be investigated but he also told the congress the 
original copy of the agreement cant be found either in the soviet 
union or in west germany 
the dispute over the 1939 germansoviet nonaggression pact is 
explosive because decades of official soviet doctrine maintain that 
the republics estonia latvia and lithuania voluntarily joined 
the soviet union in 1940 ending their existence as independent 
nations 
but secret protocols to the 1939 pact concluded by the foreign 
ministers of adolf hitler and josef stalin deeded control of the 
baltic area to the kremlin and soviet troops moved in the next 
year 
baltic activists now freer to express themselves because of 
gorbachevs political reforms demand that the official explanation 
of how their homelands came to be part of the soviet union be 
exposed as a lie 
a baltic deputy proposed creation of the commission but the 
conservative majority of the congress of peoples deputies was 
grumbling loudly and appeared to be leaning toward rejecting the 
idea when gorbachev intervened 
the baltics are in turmoil over the question he said and 
it needs to be investigated 
the secret additions to the hitlerstalin pact have long been 
known in the west but gorbachev told the congress no one has been 
able to locate the originals 
gorbachev said that when chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
visited moscow last year he asked kohl if the originals were in 
west germany 
kohl said they were gorbachev said and the soviets asked for 
them but when soviet diplomats went to west germany to get the 
documents they were told the originals couldnt be found 
gorbachev said

surgeon general c everett koops sweeping 
proposals to curb drunken driving brought sharp criticism today 
from the restaurant and lcoholic beverage industries which say 
they were intentionally left off a panel that drafted them 
this report contains a few good recommendations and many that 
are both misdirected and destructive said harris rusitzky 
president of the national restaurant association 
koop on wednesday asked for a ban on some alcohol promotion and 
advertising he says is aimed at youths in one of his last official 
acts before leaving office july 13 koop also called for higher 
taxes on liquor tougher state laws and enforcement against drunken 
driving and farreaching voluntary action by the industry 
rusitzky whose organization represents 100000 establishments 
said a majority of koops recommendations were designed to reduce 
the availability of alcoholic beverages to responsible drinkers 
the major thrust of the report if implemented could actually 
make the problem worse said gerald e murphy director of the 
national licensed beverage association which calls itself a voice 
for half a million bars and taverns 
murphy said koops proposed restrictions on alcohol 
distribution new axes and other proposals would force the closing 
of thousands of neighborhood taverns 
this will not lead to less drinking it will lead to less 
supervised drinking he said 
james c sanders head of the beer institute which represents 
breweries said koops proposals fail to consider that drunken 
driving deaths have dropped 17 percent over the past five years 
with teenage drunk driving fatalities down by nearly onethird 
he said many of koops suggestions will either not work or 
impinge on the right of free speech by restricting product 
advertising and marketing 
several industry representatives criticized koop for not 
inviting them to participate on the panel in december that drew up 
his recommendations it included experts from five federal agencies 
and scores of doctors lawyers antialcohol campaigners 
advertising groups were invited but declined to participate 
surgeon general koop has endorsed a drastic series of 
proposals that would dramatically increase the level of government 
intrusion into our private lives without a significant effect on 
the alcohol abuse problem said stephen lambright vice president 
of anheuserbusch companies 
anheuserbuschs spuds mackenzie ads for bud lite beer were one 
target of koops complaints about the industry 
koop did not draw a clear line between what action should be 
imposed and what should be voluntary but said his proposals stress 
voluntary compliance 
nonetheless representatives of the alcoholic beverage industry 
interpreted the broad program as an infringement 
koop adopted several proposals from scores presented in a report 
by the december workshop among other recommendations he endorsed 
a decrease in the amount of blood alcohol content at which it is 
illegal to drive from 010 percent to 004 percent by the year 
2000 instant confiscation of drivers licenses antidrunken 
driving programs and funding of safety and health ads to match 
alcohol ads 
forty percent of all deaths between the ages of 15 and 20 are 
the result of motor vehicle accidents and half of all crashes are 
linked to alcohol abuse according to federal statistics nearly 
25000 people died in alcoholrelated traffic accidents in the 
united states last year 
koop singled out the spuds mackenzie dog ads and miller lites 
beach party ads as promotions designed to appeal to young people 
who he said are more likely to die in a drunken driving accident 
than from any other cause 
pointing to a display of the bud and miller ads koop said 
these practices tell youth that alcohol consumption leads to 
athletic social and sexual success 
lambright said spuds mackenzie has been used extensively to 
promote responsible drinking 
he said beer prices would double under koops proposals 
in addition to the formal proposals koop also asked for an end 
to happy hours and other pricecutting promotions 
these actions may not make people as happy as happy hours do 
but they will help keep them alive koop said

at the gathering place bar a special 
honor goes to the northwestern university student whose job 
rejection letter is most like a swift kick in the seat of the pants 
on wednesday with graduation approaching it was time to select 
a champion for the class of 1989 and top honors went to student 
david whitlock 22 who became whitelock in a form letter 
rejection from e amp j gallo winery 
and the letter was dated jan 8 about a month before he was 
interviewed 
if i had gotten the letter when it was dated i could have 
avoided the interview process all together he said 
other finalists included chemical engineering student stanley 
russell or stanely as texas instruments inc called him in 
its zinger 
russell 22 said that when he sent in his resume the bad news 
came right back in a mailgram 
they wanted to reject me so fast they couldnt wait to use the 
regular mail he said 
a half dozen times this spring the senior class gift executive 
committee put together bullet nights where students got a free 
cup of beer if they submitted a rejection letter the holder of the 
most humiliating specimen of the evening won a pitcher of beer 
wednesday nights event in the bar in the student union pitted 
this years previous winners against each other 
bullet nights put a pinch of humor into the depressing business 
of being turned down for a job and gave the senior committee a 
chance to put the touch on students for donations for the class 
gift to the university 
while some of the letters were embarrassing or insulting others 
were polite and straightforward 
russell said he got a nice rejection letter after being flown 
down to atlanta for a second interview 
they try to make it sound like theyre at fault for not having 
something for someone of your amazing abilities he said 
theyll tell you theyll keep your resume on file russell 
said its a nice way of saying when we get the cafeteria up 
and running and we need a dishwasher well call you

renewed fighting in neighboring 
mozambiques civil war has led about 20000 people to seek refuge 
in already crowded camps in malawi officials say 
local authorities say the latest exodus raises to 652000 the 
number of refugees now in malawi a poor nation of 8 million people 
fighting between troops of the marxist government and rightwing 
rebels in mozambiques 12year civil war has intensified in the 
past month said fletcher zenengeya a top official in president 
hasting kamuzu bandas office 
we are very worried he said we thought the situation in 
mozambique had stabilized 
at least 1800 mozambicans recently fled to an isolated camp in 
changambika near the western border that already houses 9000 
people 
some of the arrivals said rebels of the mozambique national 
resistance or renamo stormed the governmentoccupied settlements 
of kapirizanja and ntsakama in tete province late last month 
government troops fired a few shots before fleeing into the 
bush pursued by the guerrillas the refugees said 
they said zimbabwean troops based in mozambique to guard 
transport links helped recapture the settlements but most civilians 
fled 
rebels looted our possessions and crops said gera jazi who 
lived in kapirizanja many houses were burned to the ground some 
women including my own daughter were kidnapped to be used as 
porters and wives by the rebels 
relief officials said that after new fighting at villa nova and 
mutarara farther south in mozambiques zambezia province a week ago 
about 500 refugees fled to camps in malawi 
relief officals speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
believed government troops faced increasing difficulties defending 
remote rural settlements 
the malawi government worried about crowding in camps has 
begun transporting new refugees to less populated areas in nsanje 
where vegetation has been stripped to build tens of thousands of 
shelters mozambicans outnumber malawians 3to2 
patrick de souza of the un high commission for refugees said 
food supplies were low 
we had made contingency plans for the new influx but the 
problem is that our supply pipeline is not functioning he said 
the groundnuts maize and beans that donors promised have not 
arrived in time 
no groundnuts one of the main sources of protein for refugees 
have been delivered since december 
as a result malnutrition is now our biggest problem said

the government has dropped plans to build a 
500 million annex to the pentagon according to defense department 
officials 
there is no current planning being considered on the pentagon 
annex said kenneth h evans a member of a defense department 
group being formed to oversee planning for the departments 
facilities in the washington area plans for an annex are being 
held in abeyance he said 
instead the department plans to concentrate on renovating the 
pentagon expanding army facilities at fort belvoir va and 
consolidating and possibly relocating navy offices currently in the 
crystal city section of arlington va he said 
evans spoke wednesday to a group of local regional and federal 
officials at a meeting to review federal building projects in the 
washington area 
after the meeting evans declined to comment on whether budget 
constraints or political opposition had helped scuttle plans for 
the annex 
plans originally called for a 3millionsquarefoot facility on 
the pentagons south parking lot the proposal met with strong 
opposition from arlington officials who said the county does not 
have the road or utility infrastructure to support a complex of 
that size the pentagon has about 37 million square feet of office 
space 
the size of the proposed annex was scaled back last year to 
about 18 million square feet at that time officials said a study 
of defense department needs was being considered by congress but a 
master plan on the annex was proceeding 
now even the master plan has been dropped we are restudying

a deputy in the new soviet parliament today gave a 
scathing review of the nations agricultural system and said the 
poliburo member in charge of the vast network of staterun farms is 
incompetent 
it was the latest in a series of contentious speeches during the 
inaugural session of the congress of peoples deputies and this 
time yegor k ligachev was on the receiving end 
how could this happen deputy yuri d chernichenko asked of 
ligachevs appointment to head the communist party commission for 
agriculture the commission was created last year to marshal 
official efforts to curtail chronic food shortages 
heads swiveled in the 2250member congress toward where 
ligachev was sitting with other politburo members but the 
whitehaired siberian sat impassively 
also today congress formed a commission to determine whether 
the kremlin absorbed the three baltic republics by force 
decades of official soviet doctrine maintain that the republics 
estonia latvia and lithuania voluntarily joined the soviet 
union in 1940 ending their existence as independent nations but 
secret protocols to the 1939 germansoviet nonaggression pact 
deeded control of the baltic area to the kremlin and soviet troops 
moved in the next year 
chernichenko a moscowbased television broadcaster who 
specializes in agriculture and rural life ridiculed the 
performance of the vast staterun farm sector saying how can it 
be explained that the economy that produces five times more 
tractors and 10 times more combine harvesters than the united 
states produces only half as much bread 
ligachev as a member of the ruling poliburo would once have 
been immune to such criticism from a parliamentarian 
chernichenkos sarcastic swipes at him were in keeping with the 
unprecedented tone of the congressional session which began last 
week 
on wednesday communist party maverick boris n yeltsin said 
soviets are worse off now than they were before president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reforms and he held gorbachev responsible 
the same day the president of the latvian republic anatoly 
gorbunov proposed making the 15 soviet republics sovereign states 
in charge of their own resources and laws 
also wednesday deputy yuri vlasov who won a weightlifting gold 
medal in the 1960 olympics assailed the kgb secret police and 
criticized gorbachevs handling of ethnic unrest in soviet georgia 
such remarks were never heard in the old parliament the supreme 
soviet 
chernichenko repeated a question to the congress he said voters 
had asked at campaign appearances leading up to the march election 
why is this politically significant branch the branch which 
determines the future ruled by a person who does not understand 
anything about it and who failed in the field of ideology 
ligachev became head of the agriculture commission after being 
relieved of the ideology portfolio the position that once made him 
the no 2 kremlin leader 
ligachev noted last year that there was plenty to eat in the 
siberian region of tomsk when he served there as party chief in 
196583 but nothing in his background marks him as a specialist on 
farming 
he studied at an institute of aircraft building 
in the past year ligachev and gorbachev have placed different 
emphasis on what must be done to ease shortages of meat fruit 
vegetables and other foodstuffs gorbachev has promoted leasing of 
stateheld land to individuals as the chief way to increase farm 
output 
but ligachev has said the giant state and collective farms onto 
which millions of peasants were herded during josef stalins rule 
are the backbone of soviet agriculture 
neither approach scored a clear victory when the partys central 
committee decreed a set of agricultural reforms in march the 
policymaking body approved the leasing of farmland to peasants for 
as long as 50 years but also maintained state and collective farms 
asked about chernichenkos remarks politburo member lev n 
zaikov the moscow party chief told reporters you cant just 
take the podium not knowing a person and say such things 
another politburo member vadim a medvedev said the party had 
taken action to fix the problems with farms chernichenko cited but 
he acknowledged the farm problems are indeed very serious and 
they give rise to stormy emotions and statements 
medvedev told reporters ligachev was unfairly singled out for 
criticism because all members of the politburo more or less take 
on responsibilities for all questions we all answer for 
everything 
the inaugural session of the congress was to have ended 
wednesday but it appeared the open forum would last another week 
unless presiding officers cut off debate 
gorbachev announced to the congress late wednesday that 469 
deputies had signed up to speak just 250 were heard in the first 
six days of debate which have been televised live to the nation 
gorbachev diplomatically suggested the time allotted each 
speaker be cut by five minutes to 10 minutes deputies responded 
with a joint nyet

undercover police officers in unmarked 
cars are going to be out on the prowl for traffic law violators 
police who speed 
sheriff jim mcmillan says he has received complaints about 
officers speeding when theres no need 
mcmillan said officers caught speeding or violating other 
traffic laws will have to have a good explanation or face 
disciplinary action 
chief john gordon of the patrol and traffic division said the 
program has been used periodically over the past 10 years

speed gordon said but he acknowledged that some speeding is 
done without need 
mcmillan said hes after those who speed while on routine patrol 
gordon said offending officers will not get traffic citations 
but the discipline they receive may be more severe than a fine

house speaker jim wrights son today called 
rep newt gingrich who started the investigation of his father 
another joe mccarthy and said the speaker was the victim of the 
reactionary right 
jim wright iii interviewed from santa fe nm on nbctvs 
today show at first said he would not name anyone in his 
criticism of a house investigation that led to his fathers 
announcement wednesday to resign 
but later in the interview he referred to house minority whip 
gingrich rga who initiated the investigation of wright before 
he joined the gop house leadership 
i think the republicans are going to realize that hes just a 
loose cannon on the deck another joe mccarthy said wright 44 
who is a personnel administrator with the state of new mexico he 
said he agreed with his father however that mindless 
cannibalism should end and democrats should not go after gingrich 
as soon as he becomes an embarrassment to them republicans 
theyll back away from him and let him sink on his own the 
younger wright said 
the speakers son said he was giving his opinion not his 
fathers when he compared gingrich with the late sen joseph 
mccarthy who led efforts to expose people mccarthy labled as 
communists in government and private industry 
i feel that the reactionary right has pulled a page out of joe 
mccarthys book to use a tactic against my father called the big 
lie tell a lie about somebody over and over long enough and not 
let him defned himself and youre bound to get him said wright 
i think hes been blacklisted for being an effective opponent

the american civil liberties union said 
today it has asked a federal court to overturn a resort communitys 
ordinance prohibiting sleeping overnight in cars or on the beach 
i liken it to a southern speed trap these people come into 
town and innocently get caught doing something they didnt know was 
illegal said steven brown executive director of the aclus 
rhode island chapter 
vagrancy ordinances have routinely been struck down by the 
courts as unconstitutional he added 
he said the lawsuit challenging the ordinance in westerly was 
filed in us district court on behalf of two connecticut men who 
were arrested last year one for sleeping in his car at a beach 
parking lot the men paid the 20 fine to avoid a weekend in jail 
and then complained to the aclu brown said 
the aclu has received complaints over the years about the 
ordinance but an influx of complaints last year made the 
organization decide to challenge the law he said 
many of those arrested are young people who come to the beaches 
for the day and cannot find motel rooms so they choose to rest 
before driving home he said 
these people are actually being safety conscious he said 
westerly police chief mark s champlin said about 300 people 
were arrested during the summer for violating the ordinance 
it certainly curbs our problems with breakins and 
vandalism champlin said if we didnt have the ordinance im 
sure we would have chaos in the beach area 
i think its a very strange assertion that waking people up 
from sleep at 3 oclock in the morning is a way to protect the town 
from chaos brown said this has nothing to do with protecting 
order it has to do with harassing tourists that get caught up in 
this trap 
town solicitor maureen goldberg was not available for comment 
and no one else could say how long the ordinance had been on the 
books a secretary said 
the aclu challenged the ordinance as overbroad and vague and 
said it improperly criminalized innocent conduct and was aimed at 
outofstate tourists 
the ordinance prohibits sleeping in cars or outdoors anywhere at 
night including private property except for people using trailers 
at licensed campgrounds

cambodias civil war will be prolonged 
if the united states supplies arms to noncommunist guerrillas in 
the nation vietnams state radio said today 
a report in the new york times on wednesday said president bush 
is seeking congressional support for a covert program to provide 
weapons to noncommunist rebels fighting the vietnamesebacked 
government in cambodia 
this only stimulates a civil war prolongs the dispute and 
runs counter to the common trend for an early peaceful settlement 
to the cambodian issue voice of vietnam radio said 
the radio said such a plan would go against agreements reached 
during informal peace talks held in indonesia between resistance 
leader prince norodom sihanouk and premier hun sen of cambodia 
the cambodian resistance is made up of prince sihanouks forces 
the khmer peoples national liberation front and the communist 
khmer rouge 
led by pol pot the khmer rouge ran cambodia from 1975 through 
1978 during which 1 million cambodians died 
the government was ousted by the vietnamese invasion but the 
khmer rouge remains the strongest resistance faction with about 
30000 troops according to us embassy estimates 
vietnam still maintains a military force in cambodia but has 
promised to withdraw all of its troops by sept 30 
the times quoted an unidentified state department official as 
saying arms supplies would help the noncommunist forces hold their 
own if the khmer rouge tried to seize control of cambodia in the 
future state department spokesman richard boucher on wednesday 
would neither confirm nor deny the report 
he said in washington that appropriate assistance would 
strengthen the noncommunist resistance and enhance its position 
and that of prince sihanouk in his efforts to oust the 
vietnamesebacked government 
the bush administration was unalterably opposed to a return 
to power by the khmer rouge he said 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee recently wrote to bush opposing lethal aid to 
sihanouk on the ground that it might fall into the hands of the 
khmer rouge 
china is the major supplier of weapons to all three resistance 
groups 
france will host an international conference on the future of 
cambodia in early august a few weeks before vietnam is scheduled 
to withdraw its troops

house majority leader thomas s foley said 
today he hoped congress could turn to national issues and a mood of 
conciliation now that speaker jim wright has announced his 
resignation 
and wright said he was looking forward to a more tranquil 
existence after congress doing some writing and some speaking 
i will get to do a lot of things i enjoy in life and have been 
postponing to read reflect and be with friends in a leisurely 
setting said wright after opening todays house session i 
feel liberated said the speaker who endured a year under 
scrutiny for alleged ethical violations 
foley who is expected to be elected to replace wright as 
speaker next tuesday said we need to return to a mood of mutual 
respect and conciliation between the parties i think thats the 
overwhelming desire of the leadership on both sides of the aisle 
i believe we can do that and in doing so we can return the 
focus of our deliberations to those national issues that the 
public elected the congress to resolve he said 
democrats were moving to install the new speaker quickly hoping 
to limit the political damage from the ethics controversy that 
culminated with wrights resignation speech on wednesday 
but while president bush issued a statement yesterday praising 
wrights effectiveness and dedication congressional 
republicans werent ready to let go of the ethics issue so fast 
rep guy vander jagt chairman of the gop campaign committee 
said wright believed he had done no wrong but he added the 
speaker behaved out of a thought pattern of self interest 
rather than the public interest 
wrights resignation speech was filled with detailed denials of 
the house ethics committee charges against him and punctuated with 
a plea to democrats not to try and exact revenge on republicans for 
his political demise 
all of us in both parties must resolve to bring this period of 
mindless cannibalism to an end said the man who initially 
laughed off the complaint that triggered the ethics committee 
investigation theres been enough of it 
wright mopped his forehead repeatedly and his hands shook at 
times as he delivered his selfdefense to a packed chamber and a 
national television audience 
the ethics committee investigation of the speaker which led six 
weeks ago to charges that he violated house rules of conduct in 69 
instances has overshadowed and interfered with the business of 
legislation 
every time he wanted to talk about national priorities wright 
said the news media wanted to ask me about petty personal 
finances 
you do not need that for a speaker you need somebody else 
he said announcing the end to his tenure 
despite foleys assured ascension to speaker wrights 
resignation comes at a tumultuous time for democrats democratic 
whip tony coelho of california has also announced plans to resign 
saying he didnt want to endure an ethics investigation like 
wrights 
coelho acknowledged recently that a savings and loan officer set 
him up with a junk bond buy and that he failed to properly report 
a 50000 loan toward that purchase from the officers financial 
institution 
in addition rep william gray of pennsylvania the no 4 leader 
in the party hierarchy has complained to justice department 
officials about leaks to reporters that his office is the subject 
of a separate probe 
the democrats scheduled a party caucus next tuesday to nominate 
foley and the full house is likely to ratify the choice within 
hours the speaker said by the end of june he also would give up 
his seat representing the 12th district of texas 
never before has a house speaker resigned under fire in 
midterm wrights democratic colleagues some of whom had 
privately told reporters they thought he had stayed too long 
hailed it as an heroic sacrifice for the institution and called on 
republicans to take heed 
jim wright committed a selfless act said rep robert 
torricelli dnj who helped defend the speaker before the house 
ethics committee his parting gift to this institution was a 
warning to stop looking for retribution and vengeance and 
simply get on with the nations work 
i felt it was almost like hamlet a prince on his knees and a 
very strong effective speaker were not going to have any more 
said rep don edwards dcalif 
the investigation of wright was begun a year ago based on a 
complaint by rep newt gingrich rga who was rewarded by his gop 
colleagues earlier this year when they installed him as the house 
minority whip 
gingrich who himself is now the target of an ethics complaint 
avoided reporters after wrights speech but other leading 
republicans made clear they wanted to take advantage of the 
democrats loss 
vander jagt of michigan said the democrats were corrupt from too 
many years in power in the house he said the gop would pressure 
democrats to change campaign laws to weaken the advantages of 
incumbency which favors the majority democrats 
rep richard gephardt dmo was considered the favorite to 
replace foley as majority leader rep ed jenkins dga was 
battling gephardt for that job 
four prominent democrats were working their house precinct for 
coelhos no 3 spot 
contending against gray were rep david bonior of michigan 
currently the chief deputy whip rep beryl anthony chairman of 
the democratic congressional campaign committee and rep henry 
waxman a powerful member of the house energy and commerce 
committee 
it also was unclear how the house ethics committee would wind 
down its probe of the speaker once wright leaves the house it 
will no longer have jurisdiction over the speaker and the 
committee is not expected to meet again until next week 
pending before the panel is wrights motion to dismiss the 
central charges against him that he accepted gifts from a 
developer friend including a nowork job for his wife betty when 
that developer had an interest in legislation and that he used 
bulk sales of his book reflections of a public man to evade 
house limits on outside income 
these motions could clear the air wright said but he was 
not waiting for an answer

department in fact planned to use the funds 
the senate appropriations committee gave unanimous approval 
wednesday to the overall measure which includes 12 billion for 
an assortment of veterans programs that are running short of funds 
including health care and costofliving increases in benefits 
at the same time the panel decided to remove 822 million that 
the house had inserted for extra law enforcement agents more 
prisons expanded counseling programs and a host of other efforts 
aimed at illegal drug trafficking 
the panel also rebuffed sen dennis deconcini dariz who 
proposed an amendment to provided 228 million for antidrug 
initiatives by transferring the money from pentagon accounts 
we told the american people we were going to be serious 
deconcini said of recent measures laying out federal drug 
strategies without paying fully for them were a long way from 
meeting that commitment 
but the panel voted against deconcini 245 bowing to arguments 
that president bush might veto the bill if it included the 
antidrug funds 
i dont want to see the committee do something here that puts 
this bill in jeopardy committee chairman robert byrd told his 
colleagues byrd had a private reason to avoid a veto 
the senate committees bill includes 75 million for a 300foot 
radiotelescope that collapsed last november in his home state of 
west virginia it also contains 66 million in subsidies for 
airlines serving small communities a provision favored both by 
byrd and senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
the bill includes 73 million for federal cleanup efforts in 
prince william sound alaska and orders the government to bill 
exxon for coast guard expenses in dealing with the march oil spill 
both measures reflect membership on the appropriations panel of 
sen ted stevens ralaska 
when the house passed its version of the bill on a partyline 
227197 vote last wednesday gop lawmakers supported bush 
administration arguments that the drug spending would boost this 
years deficit and could wait until 1990 democrats reveled in 
forcing republicans to vote against tougher efforts against drugs 
like the house measure the senate bill provides 892 million 
for the guaranteed student loan program for college students 423 
million for state foster care programs 342 million for the costs 
of battling last summers forest fires 125 million for united 
nations peacekeeping operations and 100 million for refugees from 
the soviet union and elsewhere 
besides removing the antidrug spending the senate measure 
makes several other changes in the house legislation 
it provides 225 million for the food stamp program which has 
had a heavier than expected caseload this year the house bill 
included no money for the program 
it drops 127 million the house provided to 91 million for 
workers whose jobs are lost because of foreign competition reduces 
the houses 88 million to 82 million for public housing 
assistance and removes 15 million the house provided for aid to 
the homeless 
the senate measure provides 19 million not financed by the 
house for the costs of keeping a weather satellite aloft 
the senate bill also eliminate a house provision allowing the 
brewers of rolling rock beer a temporary exemption from a law 
requiring a warning label on alcoholic beverage containers the 
beer is made in glass bottles with painted labels and its producer 
says it will take time to retool the labeling machines

annex said kenneth h evans a member of a defense department 
group being formed to oversee planning for the departments

the premier today urged parliament to 
consider declaring former government leader imre nagy and others 
executed for their role in a 1956 antisoviet uprising innocent of 
all wrongdoing 
also today parliament voted to abolish the death penalty for 
political crimes and lifted constraints on the ownership of private 
property 
nagy premier in 1956 was executed in 1958 after being 
convicted of antistate crimes but premier miklos nemeth today 
told parliament the nagy trial was not entirely based on legal 
considerations 
i suggest to parliament that it consider a law that states the 
innocence of nagy and other uprising leaders nemeth said 
his comments were the latest in the de facto rehabilitation of 
nagy by the communist party nemeth said the government would issue 
its official position on the trial before june 16 the 31st 
anniversary of nagys execution 
in an appeal partly directed at the soviet union nemeth urged 
other communist nations to help hungary review the revolt 
the political concepts forming the basis for the judgment 
developed not only in hungary nemeth said seeming to suggest 
the political climate at the time reflected the overall situation 
in the soviet bloc 
nemeth also appealed for calm on the june 16 anniversary when 
the remains of nagy and other executed revolutionary figures 
exhumed from unmarked mass graves will be reburied 
let june 16 be a day of mourning and remembrance and its up 
to us whether we look back on it as a day of national 
reconciliation he said its up to us that the era that began 
with the 1956 national tragedy does not end with a national 
tragedy 
also today parliament passed laws permitting unlimited 
purchases of property by individuals after decades of constraints 
on private ownership 
there was only one abstention in todays vote by the 380member 
parliament that abolished the death penalty justice minister 
kalman kulcsar invoked the memory of nagy during the discussion 
that occurred before the vote 
the death penalty vote came just one day after the communist 
hungarian socialist workers party described nagy as a 
significant figure of hungarian post1945 history in a 
statement the party described those who died in the fighting as 
a loss to the nation 
until early this year the revolt the bloodiest within the 
soviet bloc was officially described as a counterrevolution in 
february the communist party partially revised its view 
acknowledging that it began as a popular uprising a statement 
wednesday drafted by the central committee said many on both 
sides fought heroically and died for causes they believed just

education secretary lauro cavazos today 
unveiled strict new regulations designed to crack down on schools 
that are turning out large numbers of delinquent borrowers and 
contributing to a rising burden for taxpayers 
under the rules schools with default rates above 60 percent 
will be subject to limitation suspension or termination from the 
governments massive student loan program starting jan 1 1991 
currently nearly 200 schools fit in the category 
schools with 40 percent to 60 percent of their students failing 
to pay back loans now numbering 450 must reduce the figure by 5 
percent a year or face the same penalties 
the new system also prescribes increasingly strict steps for the 
more than 1000 schools with 20 percent to 30 percent default 
rates and all vocational schools regardless of their default 
rates must provide information on completion and job placement 
rates to all prospective students 
vocational schools are considered prime offenders in the default 
problem which is expected to cost taxpayers 18 billion this year 
they have an average 40 percent default rate compared to 20 percent 
for community colleges and 10 percent for other sectors 
we must weed out unethical schools and other program 
participants whose sole purpose is to profit at the expense of our 
students and taxpayers said cavazos today we are taking 
decisive action against those who cheat our citizens those who 
promise to educate but deliver only a debt 
cavazos said it was never intended that 37 cents out of every 
dollar spent on the student loan program would go to cover 
defaulted loans 
other new rules will require that all schools provide entrance 
counseling to firsttime borrowers schools with default rates 
above 20 percent develop default management plans and schools with 
default rates above 30 percent delay dispersing loans to firsttime 
borrowers until 30 days after the first day of class and prorate 
tuition refunds to borrowers who drop out before the course is 
completed 
the new rules to be published this week in the federal 
register are final the department is proposing a further 
requirement that all private vocational schools arrange for another 
school to complete their courses if they close in midsemester 
a package of proposals submitted to congress asks lawmakers to 
require that students without a high school diploma or the 
equivalent pass a test before being allowed to enroll other 
legislative proposals would require prorated tuition refunds for 
students at schools with default rates over 30 percent and 
authorize guaranty agencies to garnish the wages of defaulters up 
to 10 percent of disposable earnings 
in addition the department is taking several administrative 
steps to strengthen enforcement including increased reviews 
audits and investigations and expanded fraud detection through a 
tollfree hotline collection efforts are expected to total 630 
million a 27 percent increase over last year 
some 46 million students are expected to borrow money under the 
student loan program in fiscal 1989 the program is projected to 
cost 5 billion this year in subsidies and default payments 
according to a list issued by the education department the 10 
schools with the nations worst default problems are the sawyer 
school of business center line mich 938 percent kalamazoo 
beauty academy kalamazoo mich 895 percent cambridge business 
college detroit 86 percent paynepulliam school of trade

authorities said today they have 
made little progress in their investigation of the bombing of pan 
am flight 103 and they have found no proof the bomb was planted in 
frankfurt 
the british broadcasting corp reported on wednesday that 
scottish police are convinced the bomb was smuggled aboard at 
frankfurt airport where pan am flight 103 originated the new 
yorkbound flight changed to a boeing 747 in london and blew up 
over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 people on aboard and 11 
on the ground 
jochen schroers spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutors 
office which is heading the west german investigation said 
authorities had no evidence to back the bbc report or other similar 
claims we cannot confirm this he said 
asked if west german authorities had made any progress in their 
probe of the dec 21 bombing schroers said unfortunately 
thats not the case 
police in lockerbie meanwhile said their investigation was 
moving ahead 
i am hopeful and optimistic for a reasonable conclusion 
said constable john boyd he did not elaborate 
the west german magazine stern reported last week that a 
suspected bomb maker for the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command was released from west german custody 
because he was working for the countrys intelligence service the 
syriansupported group has been mentioned as a prime suspect in the 
pan am bombing 
west german authorities have denied that the man identified by 
stern as marwan khreesat worked in intelligence 
schroers said investigators havent the slightest indication 
that he was linked to lockerbie 
khreesat was among a group of 17 suspected popular front 
terrorists arrested in west germany in october two remain in

a couple were arrested and charged 
with murder for allegedly forcing their infant son to drink 
sulfuric acid and then claiming he was the victim of contaminated 
baby formula 
shelia smith 26 and ricky irby sr 29 both of north chicago 
were arrested wednesday on murder charges and prosecutors said 
they will seek the death penalty 
they were ordered held in lieu of 1 million bond each after a 
brief hearing today in lake county circuit court associate judge 
harry hartel set another hearing for wednesday 
the arrests and indictments came exactly five years after the 
couples 3monthold son quinten irby was poisoned 
the child lingered near death for more than two years with 
severe burn scars on his mouth and trachea he also had one lung 
removed and was kept alive on a ventilator 
he was unable to swallow to breathe or to speak said 
matthew chancey an assistant lake county states attorney 
quinten died at childrens memorial hospital in chicago on aug 
26 1986 when he was 2 
investigators believe the parents forced sulfuric acid down the 
infants throat on may 31 1984 and then claimed he was poisoned 
by contaminated baby formula 
irby filed a lawsuit in august 1987 charging negligence against 
the baby formula maker abbott laboratories of north chicago and 
the grocery store where the formula was allegedly bought 
the lawsuit claimed that the similac with iron formula the 
couple gave to quinten contained a foreign and dangerous acidic 
andor lye substance and was unfit for human consumption 
irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago 
investigators said they were suspicious of the parents early in 
the case tests on the contents of quintens stomach found it to 
contain high concentrations of a substance believed to be pure 
sulfuric acid 
but prosecutors were stymied when evidence that was in the 
custody of the illinois department of public health was lost 
chancey said this included an opened can of baby formula the 
parents claimed was contaminated an unopened can of formula a 
bottle and nipple and a pair of pants that irby claimed were 
damaged by the contaminated formula 
a break for prosecutors came last november when the us supreme 
court in an arizona case ruled that accidentally lost evidence 
does not preclude prosecution 
after that decision came down we decided to take another look 
at this case said chancey this is the type of case that never 
leaves your mind 
a lake county grand jury returned the murder charges wednesday 
following several weeks of testimony 
chancey said the state will seek the death penalty against smith 
and irby because the boy was younger than 12 and the crime under 
illinois statutes was particularly brutal and heinous

president bush wound up his european trip today 
conferring with prime minister margaret thatcher in a farewell 
meeting that showed some sign of friction between old friends 
its only with friends that you can take off the gloves and 
talk from the heart bush said after a nearly twohour private 
meeting at 10 downing street 
secretary of state james a baker iii said afterward that the 
united states and britain remain at odds on londons desire to 
expel southeast asian refugees who arrived illegally in 
britishheld hong kong 
baker said we support the right of first asylum and freedom of 
choice for political refugees 
the british also have misgivings about possible us military 
aid to argentina britains adversary in the 1982 falklands islands 
war 
nevertheless bush said the us relationship with britain is 
strong and will continue to be 
along with his wife barbara bush also attended a buckingham 
palace luncheon with queen elizabeth ii 
bush and the first lady and the queen and prince philip posed 
for pictures in an ornate picture gallery as they lined up at the 
edge of an exquisite carpet the queen admonished bush smile 
on the eve of bushs return to the united states baker said he 
hopes the presidents trip has helped still criticism at home about 
his foreign policy and responses to soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
i would hope that it might put to rest some of that 
speculation baker said it is important i think that an 
american president be seen to be leading the alliance 
despite their differences on some issues bush and thatcher were 
effusive in praising each other for the outcome of this weeks nato 
summit in brussels 
bush hailed the very very special relationship between the 
united states and britain mrs thatcher said we think very much 
the same way which isnt surprising 
its the end of containment its freedom on the offensive a 
peaceful offensive throughout the world she said 
the two leaders were allies in a successful bid at the nato 
summit to keep shortrange nuclear missiles on west german soil 
mrs thatcher credited bushs leadership as the reason for a 
very very successful nato summit 
in two days of summit talks the western allies embraced bushs 
proposal for negotiating substantial cutbacks in conventional nato 
and warsaw pact forces within the next year and rejected west 
german demands for early ussoviet negotiations on reducing and 
possibly eliminating shortrange nuclear missiles 
the president and his wife barbara joined the queen for lunch 
at buckingham palace a dinner with mrs thatcher was the final 
event before bush flies home friday for a weekend at his 
kennebunkport maine vacation home 
the presidents visit coincided with a subway strike in london 
which created traffic jams 10 miles long on major highways into the 
capital and forced many commuters to walk or ride bicycles to work 
motorists who reached the city found routes of the bush motorcade 
sealed off 
mrs thatcher is regarded as the united states most ardent 
supporter in the west at the nato summit in brussels she took an 
even harder line than bush on keeping nuclear missiles in europe 
the issue pitted the united states and britain against west 
germany after chancellor helmut kohl demanded early eastwest 
negotiations to reduce and perhaps eliminate shortrange nuclear 
missiles 
in the end mrs thatcher and bush prevailed in winning a nato 
statement that put off any negotiations indefinitely it said the 
missile talks could not begin until an eastwest agreement on 
conventional arms had been signed and reductions were under way 
in paris soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze said 
bushs disarmament proposals generally were positive but expressed 
doubt that agreement on conventional force reductions could be 
reached within a year as bush had suggested 
i want to emphasize that the british and french forces in west 
germany represent 100000 men and this creates an imbalance the 
french newspaper le figaro quoted shevardnadze as saying 
despite the missile dispute bush got high marks during a 
27hour stop in west germany where he delivered a speech calling 
for an end to political divisions in europe and a dismantling of 
the berlin wall 
the cold war began with the division of europe it can only 
end when europe is free bush told 2000 cheering people in the 
rhine river city of mainz 
west german foreign minister hans dietrich genscher who had 
prodded kohl to take an aggressive stance in the missile quarrel 
was effusive in praise of bushs speech 
it was a brilliant speech genscher said it met all my 
expectations it gave a vision of a better europe 
in mainz mayor hermanhartmut weyel gave his american visitors 
a copy of an antinuclear resolution passed by his city council 
we in mainz know there is no escape for us if these weapons are 
ever used it said 
the president arrived at dusk wednesday aboard air force one and 
was greeted by mrs thatcher and her husband denis on the tarmac 
at londons heathrow airport 
after a redcarpet welcome with a military band playing the us 
national anthem bush boarded a us military helicopter with an 
easy wave and smile to the dignitaries 
mrs thatcher joined him on the 15mile flight to winfield 
house the regents park official residence of us ambassador 
henry catto 
while bush was at 10 downing street mrs bush visited an adult 
education and day care center just across the thames river at 
brixton south london where she confessed to cooking students that 
her pie crust is not one you write home about 
bush closing out his visit to west germany took a twohour 
boat cruise down the rhine river passing by ancient castles and 
hillside vineyards 
bush called it an unforgettable day on the rhine 
the white house chartered a second boat for a handful of 
photographers and cameramen to ensure maximum coverage of the 
highly picturesque trip 
from london bush had words of sympathy and praise for house 
speaker jim wright after the fellow texan announced his resignation 
from congress 
in spite of the present situation i believe the wright tenure 
was one of effectiveness and dedication to the congress of the 
united states the president said barbara and i wish jim and 
betty well in whatever lies ahead

the food and drug administration today 
approved use of a genetically engineered drug that can help reduce 
anemia in patients suffering from kidney failure 
the drug epoetin reduces the need for transfusions to add red 
blood cells to patients who under go dialysis because their kidneys 
have failed fda commissioner frank young announced 
epoetin is great stuff said john g cole an editor of the 
journal lorain ohio a kidney patient who has participated in 
trials of the product over the last two years 
once barely able to walk on the beach or carry out the garbage 
cole said he now plays halfcourt basketball works 5055 hours a 
week and works out three times a week 
young explained that patients with kidney failure often suffer 
anemia because of the loss of a natural chemical which stimulates 
their bodies to produce red clood cells 
without those cells the body doesnt get enough oxygen causing 
lsos of strength chest pain and other problems 
in the past transfusions have been used to provide new red 
cells but with epoetin that will be unnecessary for most patients 
young said the drug stimulates the body to make its own red cells 
again 
the kidney patients will still need regular dialysis treatments 
he pointed out 
epoetin is the eleventh drug to be licensed that is produced 
through genetic engineering techniques said young 
it was developed under the orphan drug program designed to 
stimulate research on drugs needed by fewer than 200000 people 
young said about 95000 kidney patients would likely use the new 
drug although it could also prove useful for people with other 
medical problems which cause anemia includine aids and some forms 
of cancer

identity cards today to palestinians in the occupied gaza strip as 
part of a campaign to tighten control over the arab population 
the move coincided with a demand by prime minister yitzhak 
shamir that the army adopt harsher measures to crush the nearly 
18monthold palestinian uprising against israels occupation of 
the gaza strip and west bank 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir confirmed reports that the 
prime minister wants a tougher approach if current measures are 
not enough we have to consider other measures said ahimeir

palestinians have been killed most of them by army gunfire 
twentytwo israelis have also died in the violence 
in the west bank city of nablus five palestinians were shot and 
wounded when soldiers broke up a protest march by about 200 
chidlren troops chased marchers into the citys narrow alleyways 
arab reports said 
the protesters carried outlawed palestinian flags and banners 
reading no alternative but the palestinian state the reports 
said 
in the gaza strip five palestinians were reported shot and 
wounded in clashes with soldiers 
an army official confirmed that five palestinians were wounded 
in nablus in what he described as clashes with stonethrowers he 
said he was checking reports of five wounded in gaza 
meanwhile jewish extremists waving israeli flags and singing 
hebrew songs marched through jerusalems arab sector under heavy 
police guard today to mark the 22nd anniversary of israels capture

amnesty international that the army violated the rights of 
nonviolent opponents of the occupation who are being detained 
without trial in administrative detention 
more than 1000 palestinians are being detained without charges

he would not confirm or deny israeli media reports the cards 
would be run through a computer whenever palestinians pass army 
checkpoints separating gaza and israel 
palestinians convicted of serious security or criminal 
offenses will be denied the computerized identity cards the 
military official said he said he expected about 1500 gaza 
residents would be refused them 
women and children under the age 16 are exempt from the new 
requirement and can continue to enter israel with their old 
israeliissued identity cards the official said 
he said he expected 70000 to 80000 gazans to apply for the new 
cards mainly so they can keep their jobs in israel at least 
50000 gazans work in israel 
the cards are part of an army effort to improve our ability to 
supervise and control entry from gaza into israel the official 
said adding that similar cards might be introduced in the west

encamped at the british embassy in march to protest police 
restrictions was arrested today for violating them authorities 
said 
donsie khumalo a regional official of the congress of south 
african trade unions was one of six black activists who staged a 
26hour sitin at the embassy on march 2930 to protest 
restrictions placed on them after they were released from detention 
in the course of the sitin police said khumalo violated the 
restrictions which require him to report twice daily to police 
confine him to his home at night and limit his political activities 
similar restrictions have been placed on hundreds of detainees 
released in recent months after being held without charge under 
stateofemergency regulations 
khumalo was released a week before the sitin after joining a 
widespread hunger strike he and the other activists were 
embittered by the british embassys refusal to let them stay inside 
the building or use its toilets and telephones 
the congress of south african trade unions the largest and one 
of the most militantly antiapartheid labor federations in the 
country issued a statement demanding khumalos release it said he 
was taken to court today and ordered held without bail until a 
court appearance on aug 30 
government officials have indicated that the state of emergency 
declared on june 12 1986 will be renewed next week for a fourth 
year 
the labor federation demanded that the emergency be lifted and 
denounced the restrictions as cruel persecution of people who 
have spent months sometimes years in detention 
it also said it planned a threeday protest starting on monday 
in the southeastern city of pietermaritzburg the labor federation 
said police there have failed to stop factional violence between 
federation allies and followers of inkatha a more conservative 
zulu political organization 
emergency regulations prohibit general strikes but most 
protests organized by antiapartheid groups in recent years have 
consisted of supporters not going to work or school 
the labor federation said it decided to stage the protest after 
the death early today of jabu ndlovu a shop steward for a 
metalworkers union whose house was attacked and burned on may 21 
mrs ndlovus husband and one of her daughters were killed in 
the attack and she had been hospitalized since then for treatment 
of burns 
her home was burned after she complained at a news conference 
about allegations of collaboration between inkatha and police 
police have said they take no sides in the conflict which has 
claimed nearly 2000 lives in natal province since late 1986

a career federal prosecutor is assigned to 
investigate news leaks that the fbi is investigating allegations 
against a halfdozen prominent democratic officeholders the 
justice department said today 
the career justice department prosecutor will conduct 
interviews take sworn statements and could seek polygraph 
examinations to determine who is responsible for the unauthorized 
disclosures of information spokesman david runkel said today 
if we knew who the leakers were today clearly it would be the 
attorney generals intention to dismiss them runkel said such 
leaks are against justice department policy and may also violate 
federal law he said 
at least two fbi agents have also been assigned to the 
investigation to conduct interviews runkel said adding that it 
would be premature to say where the investigation would lead 
runkel said the career government prosecutor from the 
departments criminal division whom he declined to identify would 
investigate leaks leading to stories about investigations or 
preliminary inquires involving speaker jim wright dtexas reps 
tony coehlo dcalif william h gray iii dpa gus savage 
dill walter fauntroy ddc and los angeles mayor tom bradley 
attorney general dick thornburgh first ordered the investigation 
last week following a story in the los angeles times that the fbi 
was conducting a preliminary inquiry of investments by bradley and 
coehlo the house majority whip who announced his resignation 
friday 
stories this week that the fbi was conducting preliminary 
inquiries of allegations involving wright and gray the 
fourthranking house democrat prompted charges from house 
democrats that the republicanrun justice department was 
responsible for politically inspired leaks 
leaks leading to stories that the justice department was 
investigating allegations that fauntroy the district of columbias 
nonvoting delegate hired savages son for a nonshow job are also 
part of the investigation runkel said 
runkel denied the suggestion that the leaks were coming from top 
officials on thornburghs staff saying i dont believe thats 
the case based on people ive talked with 
but the chairman of the house judiciary committee and two top 
democrats on the panel charged that the leaks were politically 
inspired 
it appears to us from these articles that persons in the 
department of justice are using leaks for political purposes 
against house democrats said the letter from chairman jack 
brooks dtexas and reps don edwards dcalif and robert w 
kastenmeier dwisc 
nothing could be more destructive of the criminal justice 
process and run a greater risk of hampering the work of the 
departments career criminal investigators than the appearance that 
information about the existence of investigation is being used for 
political advantage the letter said 
in a separate letter to thornburgh gray who is seeking the 
post of majority whip being vacated by coehlo questioned why the 
justice department waited until the eve of democratic leadership 
changes to send fbi agents to his home on memorial day the 
agents told gray they were investigating at least one of his 
employees 
jon plebani grays staff director said wednesday every 
employee who works for bill gray comes to work and does work hes 
a very demanding boss 
the justice department responding to grays complaint said 
wednesday that thornburgh had ordered an investigation of leaks 
over the past week 
in their letter brooks edwards and kastenmeier told thornburgh 
that unless you take clear and aggressive steps to stop these 
leaks we will have to conclude that they have your support 
rep david e bonior dmich who is one of grays opponents in 
the race to succeed coelho as whip also chastised the justice 
department 
the american people are fed up with the effort to use 
innuendos and rumors to discredit our public officials bonior 
said we must stop this destructive politics of character 
assassination 
on wednesday runkel described thornburgh as disturbed by 
leaks that have come out of the department concerning matters which 
have led to news stories on members of congress 
if there is some attempted interference here in the actions of 
the house democratic caucus it is of concern to us runkel said

a landslide caused by heavy rains 
collapsed tunnels of a gold mine and started a fire in a remote 
mining region authorities said at least 11 people were killed and 
21 trapped in the mine 
officials said at least nine other people were injured and 165 
homes were destroyed in the blaze that followed tuesdays disaster 
in the mining town of mount diwalwal 580 miles southeast of 
manila officials said earlier officials reported that 180 homes 
burned 
mario luis jacinto regional director of the bureau of mines 
said at least 535 prospectors escaped before 13 of the 27 tunnels 
in the mine collapsed he said 21 miners were believed missing 
but crispina abat of the civil defense said there were no 
reliable figures on the number of people in the mine at the time 
she said there was confusion over the numbers of missing 
two miners were killed by falling timber and two others 
suffocated in a nearby shaft jacinto said he said three trapped 
workers located tuesday were also presumed dead after rescuers 
failed to contact them thursday 
the landslide also caused a charcoal pit in a blacksmith shop to 
tumble and ignited a threehour fire in a nearby housing area that 
burned 165 shanties the fire killed four people and injured nine 
jacinto added 
mining officials declared the tunnels danger zones in july but 
gold prospectors ignored the advice according to lt col nelson 
estares a local police chief 
jacinto said the rains had loosened soil in the area causing 
the landslide rescue operations are being hampered by ground 
movements still occurring in the area he said the heavy rains 
continued he said 
jacinto said miners reported seeing cracks on the walls of the 
shafts five and a half hours before the collapse and had time to 
leave the tunnels 
most of the workers came out but there were others who were 
hardheaded and refused to leave jacinto said 
the diwalwal mining area has occasionally been hit by caveins 
but most went unreported because miners fear the government will 
halt operations there

yuri n afanasyev moscow historian and 
progressive communist is learning what it means to be a peoples 
deputy 
arriving at the new soviet parliament with a mandate won in the 
first contested elections in 70 years afanasyev has used national 
tv to bring the concerns of progressives to millions 
during breaks in debate at the congress of peoples deputies he 
rushes from the kremlin to meet voters and students eager to know 
what is going on in the corridors and cloakrooms not shown on 
television 
hundreds of muscovites jammed into a sweltering decrepit 
lecture hall wednesday to hear afanasyev field questions for an 
hour about the work of a congress that has riveted the nation 
already wellknown in moscow and to progressive intellectuals 
across the country for his activities with memorial a group formed 
to chronicle josef stalins purges and remember their victims 
afanasyev shot to national fame when he took the congress floor 
saturday 
a professor rather than a politician he offered no political 
program but in less than 10 minutes he delivered a speech that 
captured the widespread sense of disappointment with the congress 
election of deputies to its new legislature the supreme soviet 
he said an aggressively obedient majority in the parliament 
had elected a brezhnevstalin supreme soviet the phrases 
instantly entered the popular lexicon recurring time and again in 
heated discussions of the congress around moscow 
his speech was the turning point of the congress said one 
moscow mathematician 
on wednesday afanasyev indicated that even many of his fellow 
progressives had been offended by his description of the new 
legislature 
but he was still forthright in voicing many radical demands 
winning his strongest round of applause from the audience when he 
said of course this congress should take power into its hands 
and release the party from its right to make powerful decisions 
the partys ruling politburo and central committee should 
continue to decide party matters he added swiftly but powerful 
decisions should be taken by the congress 
afanasyev a ruddyfaced man in his 50s told the crowd at the 
history institute where he is rector that he was surprised to 
receive support for his views when he met voters in noginsk about 
25 miles east of moscow on sunday when the congress was not in 
session 
the voters were more enthusiastic about getting the congress to 
change the political structure than in its solving daytoday 
consumer problems he said 
afanasyev a member of a group of progressive moscow deputies 
said the fledgling organization is slowly gaining support from 
deputies representing other areas of the country 
despite his harsh remarks he remains devoted to th work of the 
congress 
the soviet people pinned so many hopes all their hopes the 
future of their children on this congress afanasyev said 
this is the body of deputies we must trust to change the 
country

an iranian newspaper today said britain 
should expect heavy blows in retaliation for a weekend clash in 
london between moslem demonstrators and police who arrested 84 
people 
the farsilanguage newspaper jomhuri islami said in an editorial 
that britain has started a dangerous game by challenging 
moslems 
irans islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia

demonstrators saturday exposed the british government to heavy 
blows

demanding the death of british author salman rushdie moslems 
relations between iran and britain have been at a low ebb for 
three months

police divers today began searching the great 
miami river for victims and clues to last weeks bridge collapse 
that killed up to five people 
only one diver would go down at a time and would stay only about 
one minute because of concerns about the rivers strong current and 
low visibility said frank weikel a spokesman for the hamilton 
county sheriffs department 
authorities believe that as many as five people died in the 
rainswollen river after two vehicles fell in when a temporary 
bridge over us 52 collapsed during rushhour friday 
just one victim has been found so far authorities today 
identified a womans body that was found tuesday about five miles 
downriver as that of a 52yearold suburban cincinnati woman the 
womans daughter is among the missing 
one police diver made several exploratory plunges into the river 
wednesday at the site 12 miles west of cincinnati at miamitown 
investigators hope the divers can help find the remaining victims 
and clues to why it fell 
national transportation safety board personnel investigating the 
collapse are especially interested in obtaining the steel bridge 
support that failed said jean fasone head of the ntsb 
investigative team 
she said that pressure from miamitown merchants who feared 
losses when an aging bridge that is being replaced was closed 
prompted the county to select a timesaving design for a onelane 
temporary bridge the temporary bridge opened in december and was 
scheduled to be in use for about a year 
engineers have suggested that the strong current from the 
flooded river plus the pounding from tree trunks and other debris 
prompted the collapse but a fullscale engineering investigation 
has been postponed until the rivers level drops 
ms fasone said her team probably will be on site through this 
weekend but wont have its report completed for about six months 
she said

the lutherans in this nation of only 27800 
catholics welcomed pope john paul ii politely thursday as he began 
a tour of scandinavia where the protestant reformation vanquished 
rome four centuries ago 
he described himself as a brother and friend in making the first 
visit by a pope to the overwhelmingly lutheran region sparse 
crowds and reservations voiced in some quarters were expected to 
make it one of the most unusual of his 42 foreign tours 
john paul arrived from rome on a cloudy nordic spring day that 
later turned rainy awaiting him at the airport were a few 
wellwishers and a line of dignitaries led by prime minister gro 
harlem brundtland 
the pope gave assurances of his intentions and emphasized that 
norways 1000yearold christian tradition was common ground in a 
region that outlawed catholicism until the last century 
standing here on norwegian soil i am fully conscious of the 
special significance of this occasion he said speaking in 
english for the first time ever a bishop of rome a succcesor 
of the apostle peter has come to norway and to the nordic 
countries 
i come not as the representative of a political or national 
interest but as a witness of the gospel and of our lord savior 
jesus christ as a brother deeply concerned with the wellbeing of 
his brothers and sisters in every part of the world 
i come to norway as a friend full of esteem and love for its 
noble people and its millenary christian heritage 
norway is the first stop on a 10day tour that also includes 
iceland finland denmark and sweden they have only 197000 
catholics among them less than 1 percent of the population 
vatican officials have said john pauls aim is to spread a 
message of christian ethics in a highly secular region boost the 
morale of the few catholics and strengthen relations with the 
lutheran church 
one of norways 11 lutheran bishops refused to attend any 
meeting with the pontiff the lutheran church in denmark has 
insisted he not speak at a prayer service in copenhagen next week 
scandinavian attitudes on family and sexual issues differ 
sharply from roman catholic teaching which forbids divorce 
abortion and contraception a leading oslo newspaper the tabloid 
dagbladet published a caricature thursday depicting john pauls 
miter in the shape of a condom 
in what roman catholic officials described as an unusual gesture 
to counter questions about the visit king olav v took john paul to 
the balcony of the 19th century royal palace to greet about 1000 
people usually the king takes only royal guests with him for such 
appearances 
the crowd applauded politely and children waved red and white 
flags of john pauls native poland 
welcome to norway i am extremely glad to see you in our 
country the king said when john paul arrived for a 30minute 
audience 
later the pope celebrated mass in a drizzle on the parade 
ground of a 14th century fortress staterun tv estimated the crowd 
at 1000012000 including polish refugees who raised solidarity 
banners 
in his homily john paul said the purpose of his visit was to 
encourage a serious reflection on the flight from god and from 
higher moral values which is typical of secularized society 
he was fully aware of the resistance to his visit by some 
lutherans 
the church and i personally are undertaking an ecumenical 
meeting he told reporters on the flight from rome certainly 
not all the the lutheran bishops share this ecumenical path as 
sometimes some catholics also have trouble with it 
john paul is fond of skiing and was asked if he intended to do 
any in scandinavia he replied 
ive been told that the best solution for ecumenism and for 
the rapproachment of the churches would be if the pope the king of 
sweden or the king of norway could go skiing together

the problems and respond in a way that just isnt called for under 
the circumstances he said 
we dont know that there is a drought sen rudy boschwitz 
rminn said wednesday both he and leahy made their comments 
after a news conference on an unrelated topic 
both senators mentioned the speed at which congress acted to 
pass drought legislation last year and said action should be slower 
this time 
we will take appropriate steps but we wont act 
precipitously said leahy 
i dont anticipate legislation coming up on the agenda right 
away he said 
the house agriculture committee last week passed drought 
legislation that would extend the 1988 law to many crops besides 
winter wheat the bill has not been voted on by the full house

the reforms of mikhail s gorbachev have been 
a mixed blessing for the soviet environmental movement exposing 
problems but creating economic obstacles to righting past wrongs 
says a soviet environmentalist 
until gorbachev instituted a policy of glasnost or greater 
openness discussion of ecological problems had been suppressed in 
the soviet union for decades said arvids ulme president of the 
latvian environmental club known in latvia as vak 
ulme however told us officials in meetings late last week to 
look at perestroika in a different way to realize that there is 
a downside to perestroika the russian word for economic 
restructuring 
the economic reforms are speeding up the destruction of the 
environment because they are aimed primarily at saving the 
economy ulme said in an interview with the associated press 
economic resources are tight and enterprises that for the first 
time must be selfsupporting find they have little to spare for 
environmental cleanup he said moreover the emphasis is on 
increasing production 
vak is representative of the green movement of grassroots 
political organizations in the soviet union the baltic republics 
of estonia latvia and lithuania in particular where 
environmental complaints go hand in hand with nationalist concerns 
those protesting the countrys environmental ills have many 
other complaints against the regime central intelligence agency 
analyst christine westbrook wrote last december in the christian 
science monitor 
the environmental issue is one of many that have their roots in 
the forced annexation of the baltic republics by moscow during 
world war ii the united states does not honor that annexation 
the refusal to recognize the legitimacy of the forced 
incorporation of estonia latvia and lithuania into the soviet 
empire has been a longstanding and fundamental tenet of american 
policy toward the soviet union deputy assistant secretary of 
state paula j dobriansky reaffirmed in a march 11 speech that was 
subsequently issued as a policy paper 
the administration she said would seek to establish and 
maintain regular contact with a range of emerging political social 
and ecological informal groups in the baltic states 
the baltic environmental groups comprise key components of wider 
national front movements that far outpolled local communist parties 
in march 26 elections for the national congress of peoples 
deputies which convened a week ago in moscow 
ulmes group contends that kremlin economic policy not only 
pollutes the environment but also threatens native populations 
its genocide he said 
moscowbased ministries make decisions affecting about 90 
percent of the economic activity in each of the 15 soviet 
republics and that includes the heavy polluting industries 
according to published speeches by communist party officials from 
the baltic republics 
gaining control of those enterprises lies at the heart of the 
baltic drive to achieve greater autonomy from moscow said ulme 
the kremlin thus far has balked at attempts by estonia and 
lithuania to assert greater autonomy but the greens have had 
some success 
an estimated 6000 people demonstrated last sept 17 at the 
ignalina atomic power station in lithuania and the movement later 
collected 600000 signatures protesting construction of a third 
reactor at the site official soviet media credits the campaign 
with stopping the third unit 
vak and other environmental groups organized protests of more 
than 100000 people last sept 3 to protest pollution of the gulf 
of riga and they successfully battled construction of a 
hydroelectric project at daugavpils and construction of a subway 
system in the latvian capital of riga 
ulme said that vak opposed the subway not because members were 
against mass transportation but because the construction like 
other major industrial projects would require the immigration of 
large numbers of russian workers 
it would employ 50000 workers and they would be 
nonlatvians said ulme the construction of major enterprises in 
latvia already has caused such a huge immigration that latvians now 
constitute only about 50 percent of the population the percentages 
are about 80 percent in lithuania and 60 percent in estonia 
latvian environmentalists are now trying to close down or clean 
up an oil refinery built with help from the us occidental oil 
corp in the port city of ventspils where residents are afflicted 
by skin and respiratory problems of epidemic proportions according 
to accounts in the soviet press

art restorers probably will strip the loincloths 
from many figures in michelangelos the last judgment in the 
sistine chapel it was reported thursday 
many of the veils that cover the nudity in the last judgment 
by michelangelo in the sistine chapel will probably be removed 
fabrizio mancinelli director of vatican restoration work told the 
roman catholic magazine 30 days 
michelangelo painted the main altar wall containing the last 
judgment in 153641 pope pius iv scandalized by the nudes 
ordered artist daniele da volterra to paint loincloths on some of 
the figures about two decades later 
mancinelli said da volterras paintings would be too difficult 
to remove since they were frescoes and only those loincloths added 
in the late 17th century and 18th century would be erased the 
magazine said 
the sistine chapel has been under restoration since 1980

when richard gephardt called to inform ed 
jenkins he had decided to run for house majority leader instead of 
seeking the presidency in 1992 the georgia congressman didnt miss 
a beat 
i said ive made the same decisions jenkins recalled with a 
laugh as e discussed his campaign against gephardt a missouri 
democrat for the job thats expected to come open next week when 
rep tom foley of washington is elected to replace jim wright as 
speaker of the house 
jenkins who is serving a seventh term in the house 
acknowledges he cannot match the national reputation gephardt who 
also is a seventerm congressman achieved with his 1988 bid for 
the democratic presidential nomination 
but the secret ballot election of a majority leader by the house 
democratic caucus is very different from a presidential campaign 
and jenkins insists hes in the race to win 
a lot of people have written me off in the press but this is 
not a popularity contest he said in an interview wednesday 
jenkins began lining up support last week for an expected 
majority leader race against rep tony coelho dcalif the 
majority whip but coelhos surprise announcement friday that he 
was resigning rather than face an ethics investigation of his 
personal finances freed gephardt to jump into the race 
he wasnt my choice of a person to run against jenkins said 
of gephardt who built his presidential campaign largely with the 
support of house democrats but i didnt feel at that time i 
could back away and i feel this thing is doable 
while gephardt quickly lined up commitments from many of the 
house democrats who supported his presidential bid jenkins said 
hes been pleasantly surprised at the willingness of his democratic 
colleagues to listen to his message 
i really believe that if the democratic party wants to 
eliminate the gradual loss of middleincome people weve got 
to make the leadership broad enough that we have a conservative or 
a moderate at the table helping to make policy he said 
i am very good at building coalitions he added if i had 
three months on this regardless of how popular gephardt is i 
would beat gephardt 
jenkins main disadvantage is that he starts with only a small 
base of support there are only 55 southern democrats in the 
259member house democratic caucus and jenkins said he has to hold 
that base if he is to have any chance at all 
but even if he doesnt win and jenkins is not willing to 
concede that possibility he said his campaign at the very least 
will help open doors for other southern democrats in the house 
i might pave the way for somebody to be house democratic 
caucus chairman or i might pave the way for good committee 
assignments for other southerners he said 
jenkins said he hopes his campaign will demonstrate that 
southern democrats are no longer sitting back they want to play 
in this game they want to be a part of the party they want to 
broaden the party and they insist upon broadening it 
its no longer going to be a party perceived to be just for 
liberals he said

president bush had lunch with queen elizabeth ii 
on thursday sampled the splendor of buckingham palace and smiled 
for the cameras at her majestys command 
the royal event began with a glitch over the delayed opening of 
barbara bushs car door but by the time lunch ended 30 minutes 
behind schedule there were smiles all around and the queen told the 
president i hope to see you again soon 
when the presidential limousine pulled up to the palaces 
redcarpeted grand entrance bush jumped out but nobody opened 
mrs bushs door until the queen frowning and shaking her head 
raised her voice and said open it 
a us secret service agent complied immediately and mrs bush 
wearing an emerald green dress emerged smiling as though nothing 
had happened 
it was the bushes first taste of british royal hospitality and 
the queen and her husband prince philip brought out one of 
britains biggest tourist attractions the 2nd battalion scots 
guards in their red tunics and bearskin hats 
the president arrived at buckingham palace from talks with prime 
minister margaret thatcher at her downing street residence 
escorted by philip he inspected a 100strong honor guard mounted 
by the scots guards after their band played the us national 
anthem 
that was so beautiful bush told his hosts i have never 
heard the starspangled banner being played better 
then he added hastily with all respect to the marine band 
both couples then went inside chatting animatedly as they 
walked through a few of the palaces 600 rooms on their way to 
cocktails with the 30 other luncheon guests 
between cocktails and lunch the bushes and their royal hosts 
slipped out for a quick look at the mainly 17th century dutch 
masterpieces in the palace picture gallery 
its just us its very quiet bush said in a joking 
reference to the cocktail hubbub he left behind 
as they approached photographers the queen wearing a blue and 
white striped silk dress told bush with a grin smile he 
obeyed 
luncheon was served in the ivory and gold music room overlooking 
the 45acre palace garden the magnificent domed room with 18 blue 
and gilt columns has been used for many royal christenings 
including those of prince charles the heir to the throne and 
charles heir prince william 
flanked by the queen and prime minister margaret thatcher bush 
sat down to a meal of smoked salmon mousse duck with honey and 
brandy sauce broad beans asparagus and potatoes artichoke salad 
and mango ice cream 
the three wines included two which the queen served soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa when they lunched 
together at windsor castle in april they are an alsatian white 
gewurztraminer dopff 1983 and the queens private port royal 
vintage 1955 
buckingham palace said the queens choice of wines was 
coincidence 
the guests included mrs thatchers husband denis secretary of 
state james baker iii his british counterpart sir geoffrey howe 
terry hands artistic director of the royal shakespeare theater 
and charles wilson editor of the times of london 
when former president reagan went to buckingham palace just a 
year ago for tea with the queen a us television reporter shouted 
questions to him breeching accepted behavior at formal royal 
occasions 
to avoid a repetition reporters at the entrance were made to 
stand behind a soundproof glass screen

takes a video version of the old bus station photo booth then 
unleash your talents to produce a job resume birthday greeting 
even a dear john letter 
i bumped into a guy at a party last night he had just come 
back from a visit in mississippi and instead of a thankyou note 
he sent a video said bruce goldstein 41 a minneapolis 
entrepreneur and real estate developer whos starting the service 
the idea for short takes emerged last year when goldstein 
and his wife vacationing in florida paid 80 to record a birthday 
tape instead of flying to texas for a friends party 
their 7minute birthday spoof said its 83 degrees the sun 
is shining and were on the atlantic ocean youre a great guy 
gil but you aint that great 
they rented a vcr and played it at the party it was a 
smash said goldstein 
a month later goldstein read about a man who had designed a 
video booth used in a california mall goldstein bought the patent 
rights jazzed up the design and went to market as short takes inc 
the popup cards they now have can retail from 5 to 9 
said goldstein the growth in that specialty greeting card market 
is so huge i was convinced that people would spend 6 to 10 
spontaneously on a video 
so far about 20 booths have been set up in bars malls and 
colleges in minneapolis los angeles and new yorks south street 
seaport goldstein said hes received inquiries about the booths 
from around the country 
its a lot of fun said karen munoz who emerged laughing 
from a seaport booth with michelle davila its very 
embarrassing if you do something stupid though 
the women tried the booth tuesday liked it and came back again 
wednesday 
the first time was extemporaneous we were busy laughing and 
joking said ms munoz the second time they read news from 
new york for friends in virginia 
both women said theyd be back ms davila wants to send one to 
her grandmother 
the price varies depending on the area the 10minute recording 
tape complete with mailer is either issued by the machine or sold 
at a nearby counter it costs 16000 for a tapevending booth 
14000 if the tapes are sold separately such as in a card shop 
goldsteins not just president of the company he also uses the 
machines 
the other night my wife and i sent a 10minute tape to her 
aunt in california we brought our new baby into the booth with

while solidarity has plastered poland with 
campaign posters the union faces tougher competition in promoting 
its candidates on state television where authorities still command 
he airwaves 
solidarity receives 45 minutes of airtime weekly for its own 
program while the government has been using daily newscasts and 
scores of special programs to promote its candidates 
the union was assured access to state tv under the april 5 
accords that legalized it in exchange for opposition support of 
polands most democratic elections since world war ii the vote 
will be held this sunday 
problems with studio solidarnosc as the oppositions tv 
program is called began almost immediately after solidarity won 
access to the one branch of the mass media where authorities still 
had absolute control 
first according to solidarity tv expert kazimierz zorowski 
authorities moved the show back a halfhour from the agreedupon 
time of 10 pm a late hour in a country where many people rise 
early to commute to work 
attacks in the official press accusing solidarity of overly 
aggressive campaign tactics began after the first show may 9 in 
which union spokesman janusz onyskiewicz told voters how to choose 
solidarity candidates and eliminate official ones 
on may 23 authorities yanked a show containing a discussion of 
human rights by a group of lawyers running on the solidarity ticket 
saying it violated limits which may not be crossed 
and viewers who tuned in at the scheduled 1030 pm time 
tuesday to see solidaritys program featuring a popular comedian 
were treated to 18 minutes of unscheduled coverage of an election 
rally with prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski solidaritys show 
followed 
i think its a kind of panic on the part of the government 
side said jacek moskwa secretary of the solidarity citizens 
committee that is organizing the unions campaign efforts 
the government has defended its use of television 
in the current world state authorities must have at their 
disposal a state television which is their basic instrument of 
contact with the society said former government spokesman jerzy 
urban a veteran propagandist who last month was named the head of 
the department of radio and television 
in the last month a group 20 journalists and technicians fired 
from their jobs in state tv for prosolidarity sympathies after the 
december 1981 martiallaw crackdown have worked nonstop to create 
programs from scratch 
authorities provided solidarity with one camera and a crew and 
allows the union to work out of a room in the state broadcasting 
complex despite the cramped quarters the team isnt complaining 
we havent had any technical problems so far said zorawski 
who analyzes the content of both solidarity and official programs 
there is a big interest in our programs even though there isnt a 
great interest in election campaign coverage in general 
the solidarity shows mix light moments and strong doses of voter 
education 
stevie wonder was shown singing with campaign workers in warsaw 
election headquarters and yves montand charmed striking students at 
warsaw university 
the shows also explain the complicated voting process each 
voter will receive several cards with candidates whose affiliation 
wont be indicated on the ballot in order to choose a candidate a 
voter must cross off the other names 
two shows had long segments of wellknown union activists 
telling voters to remember solidarity candidates and simply cross 
out the rest 
since the instructions are consistent with election regulations 
there is little authorities can do except mount a counteroffensive 
after tuesdays program an official commentator blasted 
solidarity for advising voters to reject official candidates who 
helped negotiate the roundtable agreements that led to the 
elections 
although authorities dispose of hours of time each week 
official programs have shown little flair many of them simply 
feature interviews with candidates whose party affiliation often is 
unclear 
under an agreedupon formula state tv devotes 23 percent of its 
election coverage to solidaritybacked candidates 
for instance seven minutes of the daily halfhour show called 
election studio are produced by solidarity crews and feature 
the oppositions candidates being interviewed or speaking to voters

european papers offered president bush unstinting 
editorial praise for his disarmament proposals at the nato summit 
this week but many noted that he only acted after soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev dominated the public opinion stage with his 
proposals for several months 
the dailies hailed bushs call for speededup negotiations 
between nato and the warsaw pact to slash conventional weapons 
arsenals in europe as well as his compromise with west germany to 
negotiate eventually with the soviets on cutting shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
the agreement constituted an important step toward maintaining 
natos unity in a moment when all europes defense strategies have 
entered a period of profound revision was the opinion of spains 
el pais 
as such perhaps the most important result of the brussels 
summit is that it served to ratify that the bush administration 
after an excessively long period of indecision has actively 
incorporated the logic of disarmament begun by bushs 
predecessor 
the independent belgian daily le soir which before the summit 
predicted it could end in disaster commented 
george bush the chief actor in this success brilliantly 
took the lead of a reunited alliance which adopted a new program of 
defense disarmament and political action with as main goal the 
will to overcome the division of europe and germany 
in his first big foreign policy move george bush scored a 
real master stroke it added 
in amsterdam the leftleaning dutch de volkskrant said the 
image of george bush as a president lacking a vision on the 
development of the peace and disarmament process in europe must be 
corrected 
in an almost astonishing manner bush has succeeded in 
averting painful failure at the summit he has restored unity 
within nato and has shown himself as the leader of the western 
alliance for the first time 
londons the times an independent daily wrote that bush has 
proved an important point this week that he can change up a gear 
when the international going demands it 
the main reassurance for the prime minister margaret 
thatcher and for britain must be that at a time of approaching 
crisis the drifting presidency became a directed presidency 
the financial times also an independent british daily said 
bush will be justified in looking back at the nato summit as his 
first important foreign policy success after all the 
procrastination of the past few months mr bush has regained the 
initiative for nato in the arms control debate and negotiations 
dominated hitherto by mr mikhail gorbachev 
arbeiderbladet of oslo which represents the ruling labor 
party of norwegian prime miniuster gro harlem brundtland praised 
bush for showing promising signs as president in his way of 
handling the relations with europe 
the swiss independent paper basler zeitung wrote 
the criticism of the us president has somehow been unfair 
george bush as one knows never was a man of bold visionary 
proposals he is a pragmatist through and through reacting rather 
than initiating policies 
bushs strength resides in that last point he knows how to 
wait and when he reacts he is usually wellprepared 
but a note of dissent was struck by another independent swiss 
daily le matin which said bush has undoubtedly committed the 
sin of excess optimism here this charm operation runs the risk 
of rapidly getting bogged down in the details of the vienna 
negotiations on reducing the conventional arsenals of nato and 
the warsaw pact

despite a loud outcry from many older 
americans the department of health and human services on thursday 
urged congress not to roll back the surtax that helps finance 
catastrophic health insurance for retirees 
although preliminary estimates show the tax is bringing in more 
revenue than had been expected secretary louis w sullivan told 
the senate finance committee that is unlikely to continue once a 
new prescription drug benefit goes into effect in 1991 
more harm can be done by being overly optimistic about the 
financing of these new benefits than by being prudently cautious 
sullivan said the continuing implementation of catastrophic 
health insurance under medicare is the most appropriate course of 
action 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the finance committee 
has suggested the unexpected revenue could be turned back to 
retirees by reducing the catastrophic surtax by about 16 percent 
the committee heard a bipartisan protest about the surtax 
which is paid only by higherincome elderly americans from 
members of congress and disagreement among seniorcitizen groups 
about how to fix the problem 
the catastrophic program is a meaningful improvement in 
medicare said sen carl levin dmich however fairness cries 
out to change the current way in which those benefits are funded 
if after a flood of mail and phone calls congress still has 
not concluded that elder americans are unhappy with the program 
you aint seen nothin yet said rep harris w fawell rill 
when millions of seniors file their income tax returns next 
april there is going to be a popular revolt the likes of which 
havent been seen since the repeal of interest withholding seven 
years ago 
every person eligible for medicare benefits including those 
with private insurance is required to enroll in the catastrophic 
program which is aimed at reducing the possibility that an elderly 
person could be ruined financially by an illness 
most of the program is financed by the income surtax which is 
paid only by older americans whose incomes are enough that they owe 
at least 150 in income tax the maximum surtax this year is 800 a 
person about onethird of the cost is borne by a flat 4 monthly 
fee on medicare part b physician fees enrollees 
the surtax went into effect jan 1 but many of those who are 
being hit by the levy will not pay it until they file their 1989 
tax returns early next year 
even those for whom the law was enacted cannot agree on whether 
it is good or bad 
the national council of senior citizens remains committed to 
the implementation of the program and the preservation of the 
benefits said executive director lawrence t smedley we do 
however continue to oppose the supplementalpremium surtax 
financing mechanism 
feelings of unfairness are mounting as elderly americans 
realize that about 40 percent of those 65 and older who pay income 
taxes will foot the lions share of the cost of medicare 
catastrophic protection not just for themselves but for the 18 
million medicare eligibles who will not pay federal income taxes 
said thomas j kilcline president of the retired officers 
association 
the largest organization representing older americans the 
american association of retired persons reminded the committee 
that the program will provide some help to 75 percent to 85 percent 
of medicare beneficiaries over their lifetimes 
aarp is opposed to any delay or repeal of the benefits in this 
important act said lovola burgess a vice president as for any 
proposed changes in the financing mechanism aarp will evaluate 
them in light of their equity and potential for support 
there is a prairie fire of protest against this new law that 
is spreading across this country said ht steve morrisey 
president of the national association of retired federal employees 
simply put seniors are saying it is a new tax and a bad buy 
most federal retirees have no need of the program because they 
are covered by a federal benefits plan he said 
the committee is considering several bills to delay or repeal 
the entire program and to overhaul the financing provisions

there might be more congenial spots for 
happilyeveraftering but the state prison in this pastoral town 
is good enough say theatrical inmates who are staging camelot 
in order to survive in jail you cant allow yourself too much 
vulnerability said gordon benjamin 37 alias lancelot but 
drama keeps people in touch with their feelings and the chance to 
express them in an indirect way 
the barrington ri native could have left prison april 20 on 
parole after nearly two years on a cocaine conviction but he 
decided to stay behind bars to play the romantic first knight of 
the round table 
opening night is friday and the production is expected to run 
two to three weeks benjamin said thursday after that he plans to 
leave prison his future acting career is up in the air he said 
the inmates in the cast including some from a nearby womens 
prison call themselves the awesome convict players during a 
dress rehearsal this week they showed off the scenery they 
painted the addition to the stage they built and the tunics and 
robes they stitched under the tutelage of a volunteer costume 
mistress 
camelot is costing less than 500 to produce with support by 
a grant from massachusetts citizens against the death penalty said 
jim kelley community service director for the prison the cast 
will give performances for fellow inmates town residents staff 
and state dignitaries and on closing night for family and friends 
a converted reform school the minimumsecurity prison about 40 
miles northwest of boston is used to reintegrate into the community 
inmates soon to be released many committed drug and alcohol 
offenses but some were in prison for violent crimes 
there are no bars fences or guard dogs prisoners so close to 
freedom seldom try to escape 
im sure from the outside it seems funny because camelot is 
supposed to be a perfect world and doing it in a prison is such an 
irony said holly ward the 28yearold director 
but prison theater is therapeutic she said the inmates agreed 
when you lose your freedom you reevaluate everything said 
one actor inmate who requested anonymity camelot is a way to 
reassess your dreams and maybe to live out your dreams in some 
way 
ward said her biggest problem is actors who win release just 
when theyve mastered their roles weve been through three 
arthurs and several merlins and several mordreds 
but ward and kelley said they were stunned when benjamin 
postponed his own parole so he could go on with the show 
ive never seen a parole put off for this kelley said 
thats major 
ward began organizing inmate plays when she was a theater arts 
student seven years ago 
several years ago she directed man of la mancha at norfolk 
prison and persuaded actor richard kiley who played don quixote on 
broadway to attend this time she has invited robert goulet who 
played lancelot in the film version of camelot 
were hoping hes going to make it ward said

a genetically engineered drug that can help 
reduce anemia in patients suffering from kidney failure and may 
also benefit cancer and aids patients was approved thursday by the 
food and drug administration 
my life has been changed dramatically said john g cole of 
avon lake ohio who took part in the clinical trials of the drug 
epoetin 
the new drug is a copy of a natural human protein 
erythropoietin which stimulates the body to produce red blood 
cells 
lack of those cells which carry energygiving oxygen around the 
body is known as anemia and since the kidneys produce 
erythropoietin patients with kidney failure often develop anemia 
food and drug commissioner frank young said that in addition to 
about 95000 kidney patients who should benefit from the new drug 
it also may be useful to chronically anemic patients suffering from 
other diseases such as cancer and aids 
the approval announced thursday was aimed at kidney patients 
and the drug was developed under the orphan drug program which 
gives companies financial encouragement to produce products to 
benefit relatively small numbers of people generally fewer than 
200000 
but once approved for sale physicians may use a drug for other 
purposes 
cole an editor at the journal in lorain ohio described the 
drug as great stuff 
before entering the program cole said taking the trash out 
was a difficult trip down the driveway and a walk on the beach 
entailed asking his wife to wait for him 
now he said he no longer requires weekly blood transfusions in 
addition to his dialysis exercises three times a week walks on 
the beach and works 50 to 55 hours a week 
im never going to be able to play fullcourt basketball my 
disease has limitations but i can play a hell of a game of 
halfcourt he commented 
young explained that anemia in most kidney patients has been 
treated by transfusions which results in ups and downs in 
their energy levels in addition while blood is screened their 
remains the small possibility of infection from blood 
with epoetin the body produces its own red cells keeping 
energy at a constant level and avoiding the need for transfusions 
in 95 percent of patients he said 
the drug was developed in 1983 and the only problems reported in 
trials were those already seen in kidney failure patients who did 
not get the drug high blood pressure headache chest pain and in 
some patients siezures 
epoetin will be marketed by amgen of thousand oaks calif 
under the trade name epogen amgen said a typical patient will 
receive injections of the drug three times a week the cost will 
range between 4000 and 8000 annually the company said 
young said a decision on whether the drug will be covered by 
federal assistance programs is under discussion 
epoetin is produced by inserting the human gene which causes 
production of erythropoietin into chinese hamster ovary cells 
these cells then produce large amounts of epoetin young said 
a slightly different drug for the same use is also under 
development in a joint effort by chugai pharmaceutical co of japan 
and the upjohn co of kalamazoo mich young said

president alfredo cristiani 
took over from jose napoleon duarte today and promptly offered to 
open talks with guerrillas who have been fighting the government 
for nine years 
during his inaugural address cristiani said the process of 
dialogue will not be simple but we are willing to initiate it 
immediately 
cristiani whose rightwing political party has been linked to 
death squads that have killed thousands of civilians said we 
are not asking for anyones surrender but neither will we endure a 
terrorist war against the economy and against the people 
it was the first transfer of power from one elected head of 
state to another in el salvador 
soldiers patrolled the capital and roads were deserted after 
marxist guerrillas who recently threatened to make the country 
ungovernable ordered a ban on transportation and set off bombs 
to protest the inauguration 
cristiani whose political party is blamed for poor living 
conditions of the peasants who make up most of el salvadors 
population said 
our government will be based fundamentally on the principles 
of liberty honesty legality and security 
cristiani said he was taking office after a long period of 
anguish and need in el salvador the roots of el salvadors 
problems are old he said but sharpened by internal and 
external forces 
cristiani 41 a useducated coffee grower was elected march 
19 voter turnout was the lowest in a decade which was partly 
attributed to a ban on traffic ordered by the rebel farabundo 
national liberation front which has been fighting a nineyear war 
with the usbacked government 
cristianis rightwing republican national alliance or arena 
was founded in 1981 by a cashiered army major and alleged 
deathsquad kingpin roberto daubuisson he still is hailed by 
stalwarts as the partys maximum leader 
death squads are blamed for up to half the 70000 deaths in the 
civil war but daubuisson and arena deny any connection to the 
squads 
state department spokesman richard boucher today praised the 
transfer of power saying it reflected the strong commitment of 
the people of el salvador to democracy 
more than 6000 people attended the ceremony they included 
delegates from 36 nations including the united states 
ricardo alvarenga valdivieso president of the legislative 
assembly placed the presidential sash on cristiani who then took 
the oath of office 
the guerrillas have heralded cristiani with nightly 21bomb 
salutes blowing up power lines and utility poles at a pace 
unmatched in recent years they threatened to make the country 
ungovernable 
officials at the state power company said guerrillas bombed 
transmission towers wednesday night knocking out power in 90 
percent of the country 
on wednesday the rebels called an indefinite traffic ban and 
bus dispatchers said it was a success most of the countrys 55 
million people rely on buses to get around 
this morning streets in the capital were empty 
the transport ban has been a favorite tactic of rebels who 
threaten to shoot at or set fire to cars or buses on the roads 
also wednesday troops in the capital seized a cache of rebel 
weapons police said they netted 350 soviet rifles 300 sticks of 
dynamite and 15 million bullets 
el salvador is the most densely populated country in the western 
hemisphere infant mortality contaminated drinking water 
illiteracy and lack of roads and electricity plague its many 
peasant farmers 
the salvadoran economy would be virtually bankrupt were it not 
for the 1 million per day in economic and military aid provided by 
washington us officials have expressed concern about an eventual 
rise in illegal detentions torture and summary executions under 
arena 
cristianis first hurdle is convincing salvadorans and the 
international community that he is in charge as he claims to be 
but arena opponents and even some party insiders say cristiani is 
a front man 
arena in its early days was a political branch of the landed 
elite those who made fortunes growing and exporting coffee 
cotton and sugar cane in a semifeudal system that left the vast 
majority in poverty 
the pillars of that system have been eroded in five years of 
reformist christian democratic government duarte though he failed 
to end the war and promote prosperity is generally credited with 
having begun the foundation of incipient democracy 
politically motivated killings are far fewer than when duarte 
took office in 1984 noncombatant leftists can now organize labor 
unions and express themselves politically at considerably less risk 
of being killed 
duarte who is dying of liver cancer is concerned his efforts 
on behalf of democracy will be undone 
there may be differences between cristiani and daubuisson as 
individuals but they both support a totalitarian project and they 
both favor an economic policy that benefits the rich he told the 
associated press on monday during a farewell cocktail at the 
presidential palace

a man whose wife was jailed after he took their 
4yearold son from a hospital where he was undergoing 
courtordered treatment for leukemia surrendered with the boy 
today police said 
family court judge leon deutsch gave david pagan a suspended 
10day sentence released his wife migdalia and placed their son 
back in the custody of child welfare authorities 
deutsch gave the parents unlimited visitation rights at the 
hospital but said they must be accompanied by a city or hospital 
official to prevent them from removing darian pagan again 
pagan 36 took his son from the memorial sloankettering 
hospital sometime sunday police said the boy was undergoing 
courtordered treatment for leukemia 
darian was hospitalized friday under an order from deutsch that 
was requested by the citys child welfare administration because 
hospital officials said the boy was not getting the treatment he 
needed 
mrs pagan was jailed the last two nights on contempt of court 
charges for refusing to tell the court where her husband and child 
were 
pagan walked into family court around noon today the husband 
and wife appeared before the judge the child was in the 
courthouse but not in the courtroom 
the couples attorney steven mandel said the father had 
removed the child from the hospital and was taking him to the 
anderson medical and tumor institute which is affiliated with the 
university of texas in houston 
he did not say how far the two had traveled or what prompted 
their return 
speaking of the parents the judge said they have violated 
the order of the court and potentially harmed the child they may 
well have placed this child in jeopardy 
after giving pagan the 10day suspended sentence he added 
the mother has been punished i will order her released 
mandel said that when hospital officials went to the city 
agency doctors said darian was in imminent danger if he did 
not receive a radical form of radiation and chemotherapy 
the parents were upset because no such treatment was 
administered between friday when the boy was admitted and sunday 
when he was taken from the hospital mandel said 
the pagans are jehovahs witnesses a religion that opposes 
blood transfusions mandel said their religion did not play a part 
in the court case 
he said the child had received much medical care and treatment 
for leukemia since he was diagnosed at age 2

high interest rates continued their assault on 
private construction in april but the government said thursday 
that total construction spending rose a weak 01 percent due to an 
upturn in work on public projects 
the commerce department reported a total increase in new 
spending to 4149 billion on a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
after declines of three consecutive months that was 47 percent 
above a year earlier 
the last time construction spending fell for three straight 
months had been just before the start of the 198182 recession when 
it dropped from february through june 1981 
private construction fell 12 percent in april as the building 
pace dropped 02 percent for residential buildings and 48 percent 
for nonresidential structures 
public construction on the other hand was up 57 percent due 
in large part to an 89 percent increase in highway and street 
improvements 
neither of these movements was surprising said david 
bersen chief economist for the federal national mortgage 
association 
we should see some continued weakness in private construction 
in both residential and nonresidential building because of the 
effects of higher mortgage rates and higher interest rates in 
general in the first quarter of the year he said 
the high interest rates have been brought about by federal 
reserve efforts to tighten credit in an effort to slow the economy 
and thus stem inflation 
the number of new housing units being built was off 13 percent 
to an annual rate of 1418 billion after a 12 percent fall in 
march sepnding on singlefamily homes dropped 23 percent while 
construction of multifamily homes rose 29 percent 
the only increase in the nonresidential category was for 
industrial spending up 19 percent 
industrial building should be up because capacity utilization 
is very tight in a number of industries bersen said the 
demand for goods has been pretty strong particularly for exports 
and firms should be increasing their industrial capacity 
bersen also found the 23 percent decline in office building 
unsurprising because in addition to higher interest rates there 
is still in a number of cities a glut in office buildings 
while public construction totaled a seasonallyadjusted 793 
billion in april bersen said he expects it to slow in coming 
months because government spending at all levels is slowing 
the only reason that public construction should have gone up 
in april as it did was that there was a sharp drop in march he 
said and the march drop was reeally below the trend 
public construction fell 85 percent in march

thousands of rail passengers meanwhile braced for a oneday 
strike friday at the statecontrolled rail system as its 63000 
employees continued a longrunning battle with management for 
better pay 
the strikes formed part of a sixmonth battle for higher pay by 
employees of state enterprises who oppose the socialist 
administrations efforts to keep pay increases moderate to contain 
inflation that is running at a 67 percent annually 
a rail spokeswoman guaranteed service on four international 
routes madridparis barcelonaparis barcelonabern 
switzerland and barcelonageneva as well as 19 night trains to 
and from major provincial capitals 
on friday between 50 percent and 75 percent of regular commuter

obligatory public service campaign spots for the june 15 european 
parliamentary elections and an hour of childrens cartoons 
the only previous 24hour tv strike in spain came dec 14 when 
socialist and communist unions carried out a general strike to 
pressure the government of socialist prime minister to make a 
leftward shift away from inflationfighting economic austerity

even in the heat of a 
championship squash match alfredo fredy cristiani the 
empitome of good sportsmanship never lost his temper or 
gentlemanly grace 
it is that suaveness and composure that helped the former 
standout athlete win the presidency which he took over thursday 
from jose napoleon duarte 
the 41yearold useducated businessman is a public relations 
dreamcometrue for his rightist party the republican nationalist 
alliance 
from its inception in 1981 the party known as a arena 
developed a neofascist image and a reputation for murder 
it was founded by cashiered army intelligence maj roberto 
daubuisson whom us officials human rights groups and the roman 
catholic church have linked to rightist death squads that killed 
thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s 
when daubuisson lost the presidential election to duarte in 
1984 it became evident that arena needed refurbishing if the right 
were to regain the power it exercised during previous decades in 
alliance with the armed forces 
daubuisson ceded the party presidency to cristiani an urbane 
and strapping coffeegrower and pharmaceutical distributor 
be assured that i entered politics only because of the 
countrys grave crisis and not motivated by personal ambition 
cristiani said in radio spots during the campaign for the march 19 
election 
id rather be running my business or deepsea fishing he 
said in an interview last year 
what remains to be seen is whether the accomplished sportsman 
he was national squash champion through most of the 1970s a 
national motocross champ and a member of the national volleyball 
team has the final word on government policy 
he says he is in charge opponents of arena doubt it however 
they say he is little more than a palatable front for what remains 
a totalitarian party 
but a friend and former courtmate said fredy is no pushover 
pushovers dont become champion athletes 
cristiani graduated from washingtons georgetown university in 
1968 with a degree in business administration 
he is married to margarita llach a member of one of the 
countrys most aristocratic families they have three children 
ranging in age from 14 to 18 years old 
cristiani also is connected by marriage to the military elite 
his wifes sister is married to outgoing defense minister gen 
eugenio vides casanova

the state department said thursday the capture 
of ammunition alleged to have been supplied by cuba to leftist 
guerrillas in el salvador contradicts cubas stated support for the 
central american peace process 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said that among the items 
seized by government forces on tuesday was 1 million rounds of 
ammunition bearing stamps indicating they were made in cuba 
the cache was found following a tip from a captured member of 
the fmln guerrillas it was described by salvadoran military 
leaders as the largest cache of insurgent weapons ever captured 
the discovery boucher said belies cubas assertion of 
support for regional peace agreements that reaffirm the principal 
of noninterference in the internal affairs of central american 
nations 
boucher said the cache also included 283 soviet ak47 assault 
rifles hundreds of other soviet bloc weapons and material for the 
manufacture of explosive devices including 892 onepound blocks of 
tnt 
these weapons were to be used to commit terrorist acts against 
the people of el salvador boucher said 
other officials asking not to be identified said the captured 
fmln guerrilla had told salvadoran authorities that the weapons 
were sent from nicaragua to el salvador on refrigerated trucks 
the officials said that such transportation was used presumably 
to minimize the possibility that the explosive devices would 
detonate in the hot weather 
while the ammunition appeared to be of cuban origin the point 
of departure of the other equipment was not clear the officials 
said 
they added however that past patterns have been that the 
weapons are sent to the rebels from cuba by way of nicaragua 
as boucher spoke aldredo cristiani was sworn in to a fiveyear 
term as president of el salvador succeeding jose napoleon duarte 
boucher said the united states continues to support the 
consolidation in el salvador of a democracy in which security 
flows from respect for human rights the rule of law and equitable 
development 
we applaud president cristianis firm commitment to these 
goals he said 
indiana sen richard lugar rind a former chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee headed the us delegation to 
the inaugural 
vice president dan quayle plans a visit to el salvador and three 
other central american countries later this month

a warning to boaters about stormy 
weather on chesapeake bay wasnt transmitted until after the storm 
which killed at least one person coast guard and national weather 
service officials say 
the warning may have been stuck in a computer in virginia and 
been delayed because of a computer error officials said wednesday 
the weather service issued its first bulletin at 1044 am 
saturday warning boaters of storms and galeforce gusts 
approaching from the west at 40 mph at 1230 pm the warning 
area was extended 
but the first bulletin was not relayed to coast guard 
installations on the bay and the second bulletin was not circulated 
until 130 pm coast guard and weather service officials said by 
then the storm had passed 
a kent county man is missing and presumed drowned and a new 
jersey man drowned when his boat capsized near fortescue nj 
marian peleski a weather service meteorologist at new castle 
county airport said she was told by a computer programmer at the 
coast guards 5th district station in portsmouth va that the 
bulletin was rejected by the communication computer peleski said 
she was told that when the computer was repaired last winter 
programmers forgot to instruct the system to receive and relay such 
bulletins 
petty officer first class rick woods a 5th district spokesman 
said an investigation is under way 
it could have been a computer error woods said the tempo 
of activity or an overload of the circuits could have caused the 
communication failure

representatives of 151 governments in the 
world bank will make about 10 billion available over the next 
three years to support treasury secretary nicholas f bradys plan 
for cutting debt in the third world bank spokesman frank vogl 
estimated thursday 
amounts for particular countries havent been worked out yet 
because our board is going to consider threeyear programs for the 
first time he added 
he said the 22 members on the boards of executive directors soon 
will consider a oneyear package of 15 billion in loans to mexico 
under guidelines announced thursday after more than two days of 
closeddoor board meetings 375 million of that new money will be 
available to apply to mexicos existing 108 billion debt 
the loans from the bank could help mexico settle old debt at a 
discount another use would be to persuade the private banks that 
hold most of it to write off a part in return for assurances that 
interest will be paid on the rest 
the world bank issued a statement quoting its president barber 
conable as saying the member countries were in broad agreement 
on the percentages of its loans that could be set aside for debt 
relief the world bank approved more than 19 billion in loans last 
year 
each case will be handled separately conable said he added 
that the setaside would be about 25 percent of adjustment 
lending this is the kind of lending which like the loans 
planned for mexico require the borrowing government to make 
promises about new policies he added that for countries where the 
bank is concentrating on its traditional loans for specific 
prjects such as roads and schools the figure would be 10 percent 
of the total lending 
both figures would cover a threeyear period 
the directors agreed that in some cases an additional 15 percent 
of the world banks lending could be made available to reduce a 
countrys debt and payments 
third world debt totals about 12 trillion about 60 percent 
owed to commercial banks and the rest to governments and 
intergovernment agencies like the world bank and the international 
monetary fund a similar policy of setasides was announced last 
week by the fund the banks sister organization

childless couples in which the man is infertile 
could have a new chance to raise a family because of a surgical 
technique that opens a microscopic gateway to the human egg 
the procedure called partial zona dissection or pzd involves 
extracting eggs from a woman and making a tiny incision to help the 
sperm enter 
it has been tried at 12 infertility clinics worldwide but the 
only documented success has occurred at reproductive biology 
associates of atlanta a private company working with the emory 
university medical school center for infertility 
dr jacques cohen the companys scientific director said of 
the 27 women he has treated during the past year seven became 
pregnant and four of those have delivered babies including two 
sets of twins the three others are still pregnant 
cohen is not ready to claim that the technique is the answer for 
infertile men who make up 40 percent of all infertility cases but 
he said it offers new hope for many 
i think its a first step in the right direction cohen said 
wednesday i think its the biggest breakthrough in years in male 
infertility treatment 
the work has yet to be published in a medical journal but an 
independent fertility expert agreed it has wideranging 
implications 
this is still a procedure thats in early development but im 
very enthusiastic about it said dr zev rosenwacks director of 
cornell universitys center of reproductive medicine and 
infertility i think its a breakthrough 
dr john gordon whose published research on mice eggs at mount 
sinai hospital in new york laid the groundwork for cohens work 
said i think this is going to be a major component of treatment 
for infertility in years to come 
in vitro fertilization in which eggs are extracted from a 
womans body and united with sperm in a laboratory then replaced 
in the womb to grow to maturity has been available for humans 
since its development in 1978 in great britain since then about 
15000 test tube babies have been born worldwide according to 
the american fertility society 
but that work has been largely unsuccessful with male 
infertility the key to pzd is that immobile or malformed sperm or 
sperm in counts normally too few for successful fertilization can 
gain access to the egg said cohen who developed the procedure 
along with dr henry malter and a research team 
pzd which costs about 7000 for each treatment involves 
placing the eggs in a sucrose solution to shrink them so the 
delicate interior is protected the egg is smaller than the head of 
a pin 
using a tiny pipette and needle the outer wall of the egg is 
pierced in two places and a small incision is made the egg is 
allowed to expand again and is mixed with sperm 
diane geheber of atlanta who underwent the procedure last 
summer gave birth to a baby boy on april 30 six years after she 
and her husband fred first looked into in vitro fertilization as 
an answer to their fertility problems they tried pzd after other 
attempts failed 
i knew it was experimental but i didnt want to wait mrs 
geheber said wednesday i wanted to go ahead and pull out all the 
stops it takes some people years and years and then they find out 
they could have done something about it 
there are some problems with the pzd method cohen said it is 
difficult to control the number of sperm that enter a given egg 
once a hole is made in its outer wall when more than one enters 
the egg is genetically abnormal and the resulting embryo dies that 
has happened in about 25 percent of pzd cases 
the researchers dont expect a problem with multiple births and 
the significance of the two sets of twins remains unknown 
in addition men whose sperm has several abnormalities probably 
wont be helped by pzd cohen said 
but the development means some infertile couples have another 
opportunity to raise a family 
were really excited and we consider ourselves very very 
lucky said mrs geheber a lot of people go through it a 
number of times and still dont have children

the ports along the oxus river in 
far northern afghanistan are the governments lifeline and the 
mounds of wheat and barrels of cooking oil are a constant reminder 
of its debt to the soviet union 
the settlement of 5000 people along the banks of the river that 
divides the soviet union and afghanistan didnt exist until six 
years ago the four ports in hayratan store 162000 tons of food 
and other supplies essential to embattled southern cities 
including the capital kabul 
without the supplies the nation faces desperate shortages of 
food and fuel brought on by the 11yearold war between the 
sovietbacked regime and the moslem guerrillas 
when you see that all the requirements of the people of 
afghanistan come from the soviet union you have to be proud of the 
ties with moscow and strengthen them said mohebullah sediq 
governor of hayratan 
the oxus divides afghanistan and the soviet union spanning the 
river is friendship bridge which the last of the soviet troops 
crossed on feb 15 to end a nineyear military intervention 
but the kremlin still ships hundreds of tons of supplies to 
kabul daily some travel by barge or rail and transferred to 
trucks while others arrive by plane 
afghanistan was selfsufficient in food before the civil war 
but the fighting has destroyed fields and orchards and forced the 
government to import almost all its food 
soviet assistance particularly weapons and ammunition has 
enabled the government of president najib to hold its ground since 
the red army left with no apparent end in sight to the civil war 
however it is uncertain how long the aid will continue 
as many as 50 soviet military transport planes descend daily on 
the capital bringing food weapons and ammunition 
trucks rumble 360 miles down the salang highway through the 
hindu kush mountains to kabul a city of 225 million people 
during the bitter winter supply convoys from the border often 
were blocked by guerrillas but most relief agencies say trucks are 
reaching the capital now without problem 
the waterfront is lined with sacks of wheat vegetable oil from 
singapore dusty pickup trucks tractors and cars and even 
equipment for a longplanned pepsi cola plant in kabul 
huge cranes lift goods onto waiting trucks among the supplies 
are 3200 tons of flour 1100 tons of sugar and 12300 tons of 
cooking oil and tens of thousands of tons of cement wood and 
metals 
a faded poster at the port entrance underscores the relationship 
between the superpower and its warweary southern neighbor blue 
circles indicate food fuel and medicine brought into afghanistan 
from the soviet union while black rockets and a red white and blue 
claw with dollar signs indicate supplies brought in from pakistan 
to the guerrillas 
leaders of the guerrillas are based in pakistan and iran us 
aid to the insurgents is funneled through islamabad

vice president dan quayle will visit central 
america this month on a fourday trip to show administration 
support for the newly elected president of el salvador and rally 
opposition to panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega quayles 
office said thursday 
the june 1114 journey will include stops in guatemala 
honduras el salvador and costa rica 
quayle is to meet with the presidents of those countries as 
well as political opposition and military leaders he will also see 
leaders of the nicaraguan contra rebels said his press secretary 
david beckwith he declined to say where that meeting would take 
place 
the trip will be quayless second to el salvador following a 
visit in early february in which the vice president sternly linked 
continued us aid to a commitment by government and military 
leaders to crack down on human rights violations 
since that visit the election of alfredo cristiani as president 
has created new worries on capitol hill because of ties between 
cristianis party arena and past death squad activity 
cristianis inauguration thursday sparked leftist violence in el 
salvador and a spate of protests across the united states by 
activists opposed to continued us aid 
but quayles visit is meant to demonstrate us support for 
cristiani and the intention to give him a chance to make good on 
his promise to uphold human rights and seek a negotiated settlement 
to the countrys bloody rebel war 
quayle is expected to underscore the human rights message again 
but without the stern lecture he gave military generals on his last 
visit 
quayles discussions regarding panama may be colored by the 
upcoming report of an organization of american states delegation 
that visited panama 
the team of diplomats from trinidad guatemala and costa rica 
recently returned after four days of futile talks aimed at finding 
a solution to the political crisis stemming from may 7 elections 
that were widely seen as rigged by noriega 
they make their formal report to the oas on june 6 as a beefed 
up us military presence in panama and harsh antinoriega rhetoric 
have resulted in no visible signs that noriega is on the way out 
quayle will encourage us allies in the region to stick with 
the united states in its antinoriega effort beckwith said 
he also is expected to discuss the central american peace 
process aimed at ending the rebel war in nicaragua 
the contra troops encamped inside honduras near the nicaraguan 
border are being sustained with us nonmilitary assistance until 
nicaraga hold elections next february 
the bush administration has committed to the diplomatic route in 
nicaragua while watching to see whether that countrys leftist 
government will fulfill its promises of democratic reforms 
quayles earlier visit to el salvador on the first foreign trip 
of the bush administration was to highlight us attention to the 
region and to warn el salvador that the new us president expected 
enforcement of human rights standards

prime minister yitzhak 
shamir is proposing new and harsher military measures for dealing 
with the nearly 18monthold palestinian uprising 
but lack of money and manpower limit military options and army 
commanders maintain they cannot by force alone crush the 
intefadeh arabic for uprising instead steps are being 
suggested that put the emphasis on economic pressure 
maj gen meshulam amit commander of the 4800member border 
police told reporters the textbook ratio was one trooper for every 
15 protesters but the nation of 42 million cannot muster the 
manpower to meet such standards 
if israel was going to confront every 100 to 150 protesters 
it would need 200000 troops in the west bank amit told 
reporters invited last week for the first time to see israels only 
antiriot unit train at this base 
the border police and army soldiers face hundreds and sometimes 
thousands of hitandrun protests and stoning attacks every day in 
the 420 villages and 25 cities of the west bank an area the size 
of rhode island 
defense minister yitzhak rabin has said an average of 10000 
soldiers were on duty at any one time in the occupied west bank and 
gaza strip last year 
the cost is about 15 million a month which experts say could 
increase tenfold if there was a massive callup of reserves 
finance minister shimon peres estimates the total cost of the 
uprising at about 1 billion including a central bank estimate of 
a 630 million annual drop in exports and tourism resulting from 
the intefadeh 
armed forces chief of staff lt gen dan shomron facing calls 
for his resignation from frustrated israelis said on israel tv 
this week the public would have to put up with some unrest because 
the army was constrained by law from using its full might against 
civilians 
i think we have to pay that price unless someone decides that 
this army will act against the norms and against the law he 
said those speaking of wiping out the uprising speak of 
something outside the framework of the law maybe they just forget 
to mention it 
at least 503 palestinians and 22 israelis have been killed since 
the revolt began in december 1987 
shamirs call for a harsher military stand comes amid pressure 
from hawks in his party led by trade minister ariel sharon who as 
defense minister orchestrated the 1982 invasion of lebanon 
rightwingers demand the government end its ambivalence and give 
top priority to crushing the palestinian rebellion some advocate 
largescale deportations for plo activists demolishing more houses 
of stone throwers and arresting prominent palestinians involved in 
dialogue with israels peace camp 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir confirmed the prime 
minister had urged new but unspecified military steps on rabin a 
member of the rival leftofcenter labor party and the minister 
responsible for the occupied lands 
we could have put an end to the uprising in the first week by 
killing thousands of arabs and expelling hundreds more we would 
have been criticized for a week but then it would be calm 
ahimeir said we didnt take this course and it is probably one 
reason the unrest has been prolonged 
ahimeir said the premier was determined the rioting should stop 
and harsher measures may be needed but he stressed the 
government would maintain a policy of holding bloodshed to a 
minimum 
the daily yediot ahronot quoted rabin as responding that the 
uprising cannot be eliminated by military means only by a 
political move several members of shamirs likud bloc and other 
rightwing legislators demanded rabins resignation 
some officials believe economic and administrative pressure is 
the most effective transport minister moshe katzav of shamirs 
likud bloc has urged sealing off the gaza strip and its 700000 
residents for three months this would keep up to 50000 arabs from 
jobs in israel 
arieh shalev a retired general and exwest bank military 
governor proposed four measures to reduce violence 
ban arab laborers from working in israel for a fixed period of 
several months 
single out one trouble spot to be put under a threemonth 
curfew during which time residents would be only allowed out of 
their houses to buy food 
halt exports and travel across bridges to jordan where 
palestinian farmers and manufacturers market their goods 
prohibit the transfer of money from abroad 
the plo reportedly sent more than 60 million last year to 
compensate palestinians for relatives who were killed or injured 
and houses that were demolished an israeli official estimated 
nearly 1 billion in plo money had been sent to the occupied lands 
in the past decade 
israel will pay a price economically by losing arab labor but 
these measures will bring strong pressure on the palestinians to 
give priority to making a living instead of staging protests 
said shalev an analyst at tel aviv universitys jaffee center for 
strategic studies

hundreds of university students crashed a 
progovernment rally outside beijing on thursday and blocked 
several thousand workers and peasants from entering a stadium to 
take part 
chinese people dont let the government trick you the 
students yelled oppose government scare tactics 
inside the asian games bicycle stadium in changping county 15 
miles north of beijing about 600 protesters wearing the new straw 
hats they received for participating listened to speeches 
supporting premier li peng who ordered martial law in the capital 
may 20 
li and other hardline communist party members are trying to 
discredit the students movement for democracy and gain the edge 
in a power struggle with moderates 
outside the stadium demonstrators were listless and many said 
they had been forced to attend some ate popsicles others laid 
their neatly painted signs on the pavement and sat in the shade 
we had to show up or else wed lose a days pay said li 
jianguo a truck driver who came with two colleagues they sat in 
the cab of his truck 
look ive come here thats enough no one is going to make 
me yell some kind of chant said one of his friends 
others said they had been threatened with losing their jobs 
our country has many economic problems if i lose this job i 
wont be able to find another said a college graduate working in 
a government office 
down the street two farmers sat on the sidewalk and held little 
yellow flags that said down with turmoil support the communist 
party 
i dont know why im here said one as he rolled a 
cigarette in newspaper my village head said go and i went 
government authorities who had invited western reporters to the 
protest refused to let them enter the stadium they did not explain 
why 
the demonstration the fifth in two days held to support li was 
an attempt to counter the scores of protests in which students have 
demanded he resign 
since martial law was declared millions of chinese have taken 
to the streets calling for li to step down 
a progovernment demonstration staged wednesday on the outskirts 
of beijing topped the national news 
listen to the voice of the peasants read one headline in 
thursdays edition of the beijing daily 
peasants support the party said another in the peoples 
daily 
most of the people here know the truth said meng aimin a 
student from the institute of petroleum engineering who said he 
attended thursdays rally to present the students side of the 
story theyre just afraid of their leaders who forced them to 
come 
as he spoke several hundred demonstrators inside the stadium 
massed at the gate and talked with students standing outside 
dont listen to your leaders the government is corrupt 
said one student to a nodding worker 
a local official came out and split the two groups 
now you listen to me he shouted at the progovernment 
protesters i am your leader not anybody else now repeat after 
me 
thrusting a fist in the air he shouted support li peng 
support the communist party 
but the silent demonstrators backed away with embarrassed smiles 
dog yelled one student what kind of thing are you 
yelled another 
the official would not be moved he repeated himself again 
silence 
the students roared 
victory is ours they chanted victory to the people

solidarity accused the communisty 
authorities thursday of escalating a propaganda campaign to shake 
peoples confidence in opposition candidates 
a communist newspaper said the oppositions goals threaten 
polands security 
authorities appeared increasingly concerned that voters in 
sundays parliamentary election would vote against even those 
communist candidates who were running without opposition 
on the evening television news commentators argued against 
crossing out the names of 35 communist party or partyallied 
candidates running unopposed 
at stake are all 460 seats in the sejm or parliament and the 
100 seats in the newly created senate the first freely elected 
legislative chamber in the east bloc the opposition has been 
allotted 161 of the sejm seats 
in a frontpage editorial thursday in the daily trybuna luda 
communist editor jerzy majka said that what the opposition is 
pushing for and the ways in which it is doing this threatens the 
security of poland and poles 
it could tip the fragile balance of forces in europe and the 
world and pose a threat of dangerous consequences majka said 
it cuts down on polands sovereignty in favor of the west 
the government coalition this week has issued increasingly 
strong statements accusing the solidarityled opposition of 
inappropriate links to western organizations 
solidarity said the criticisms repeat charges used during the 
governments long duel with the union which was legalized again in 
april after its repression during the martial law crackdown of 1981 
in the last week before the election we notice a stepping up 
of the campaign against solidarity that aims to rattle societys 
confidence in solidarity said piotr konopka reading a statement 
of the solidarity citizens committee 
they say we are using foreign funds this argument has been 
used in the past and should stop said the statement 
solidarity says aid received from abroad is consistent with 
polish law the union has not specified how much it receives but 
said it comes mainly from poles and supporters in unions and the 
arts 
the elections stem from the political economic and union 
reforms negotiated during two months of talks that ended in april 
the government invited the opposition to talk in part to reduce 
social tension and create an atmosphere of reform to encourage 
foreign investment and help with polands 39 million foreign debt 
solidarity leader lech walesa who is not a candidate appeared 
at an election rally in gydnia near his gdansk home and spoke to 
about 5000 chanting supporters 
in the last 45 years i dont remember such elections we have 
a bigger chance now to make this the country of our dreams 
walesa said 
asked about the oppositions prospects he said if we get 15 
percent or 50 percent i will say thank you 
walesa met thursday with a polishamerican businesswoman as part 
of an effort to save soldaritys birthplace the lenin shipyard 
from governmentordered liquidation he also met with the director 
of the shipyard 
the union said barbara piaseckajohnson a polishborn heir to 
the johnson and johnson pharmaceutical fortune signed a 
preliminary agreement to form a joint stock company intended to 
save the yard there was no independent confirmation 
the government announced plans in december to liquidate the 
shipyard where solidarity was founded in 1980 saying it is 
unprofitable authorities since then have been negotiating with 
various private companies to sell off parts of the yard or to 
operate enterprises there 
the rev henryk jankowski a prosolidarity pastor said walesa 
mrs piaseckajohnson and the shipyard director czeslaw tolwinski 
signed a preliminary agreement to form a join stock company to save 
the yard the enterprise is to start operating by jan 1 he said 
jankowski gave no further details on mrs piaseckajohnsons 
plans for the company

singer carly simon and slugger darryl strawberry 
greeted squealing fans thursday as they were honored in a central 
park ceremony for their commitment to helping children 
the creator of such hits as youre so vain said standing 
next to the mets star had a special significance for her 
as an 8yearold or 10yearold while my friends were 
dreaming of being movie stars rock stars or whatever my goal was 
to hit one over the center field fence she said adding that 
jackie robinson was her childhood idol 
any time you have a dream dont imagine its an impossible 
dream ms simon told the group of about 100 children gathered at 
a park playground 
ms simon and strawberry were among the adults and children 
getting community service awards from the association to benefit 
children a group that helps poor handicapped and aidsstricken

a federal nutrition program for low income 
pregnant women and children is reaching only about half those who 
need it in the united states according to two reports released 
thursday 
about 75 million women infants and children are eligible but 
48 percent are not participating in the program said robert fersh 
executive director of the food research and action center which 
conducted the two studies 
our central finding is that young children those between the 
ages of one and five are the least likely to receive the benefits 
of wic special supplemental food program for women infants and 
children he said 
in general lowincome children tend to be shorter and 
lighter and are more likely to suffer from impaired iron status 
and anemia he said poorer iron status is associated with 
poorer performance on standardized tests 
he said even mild undernutrition can lead to bad behavior 
increased illness and decreased ability to learn 
fersh said more federal funding is needed if there is to be more 
wic participation 
fersh appeared at a press conference with sens patrick leahy 
dvt chairman of the agriculture nutrition and forestry 
committee and rudy boschwitz rminn to release the studies and 
a letter signed by 73 senators supporting a 150 million increase 
in wic funding 
the letter to sen quentin burdik dnd chairman of the 
appropriations subcommittee on agriculture rural development and 
related agencies seeks a total 2158 billion for the program 
that is the same amount recommended in the budget resolution for 
fiscal 1990 passed by congress in a compromise with the white 
house but that does not mean wic will receive the amount several 
other legislative procedures must follow before funds are actually 
granted 
last year burdicks subcommittee increased wic funding by 55 
million though the senate budget committee had recommended a 150 
million increase his subcommittee is expected to make its

south korea will carefully consider 
whether to accept a north korean proposal to resume exchanging home 
visits by separated family members in the divided land a 
government official said thursday 
we will carefully study the north korean proposal and make our 
position known shortly said the official at the national 
unification board which handles interkorea relations 
another official at the ministry said however that seoul would 
have to accept with some reservations the north korean proposal 
which he believes has political motives to stir up instability in 
south korea 
we know that north korea has ulterior intentions in making the 
proposal but we will have to accept it from a humanitarian point 
of view the official said speaking on condition of anonymity 
in a letter sent to seoul through the border village of 
panmunjom on wednesday north korea proposed the two nations 
exchange arts troupes and home visits by separated family members 
on aug 15 the korean national liberation day 
north korea also suggested that working officials of both 
nations meet at the border village june 16 to work out details of 
the proposal 
if the proposal is implemented it will be the second exchange 
of separated family members between the two koreas in 1985 the 
two koreas exchanged 50 people each for family reunions for the 
first time since their land was divided in 1945 
south korea sought to further expand the humanitarian program 
but north korea suddently halted negotiations the following year to 
protest annual ussouth korea joint team spirit military 
exercises 
there are about 10 million dispersed family members in the two 
nations they have been separated since the korean war ended in 
1953

surgeons who are splitting livers for transplants 
with growing frequency and success said thursday the procedure is a 
solution to the serious organ shortage 
were potentially doubling the number of patients who could be 
treated with an available donor said dr jean emond assistant 
professor of surgery at the university of chicago 
doctors in pennsylvania are reporting another milestone whats 
believed to be the first transplant on a patient who previously had 
a donated liver inserted next to her own failing organ when she was 
in a coma the teenagers natural liver and auxiliary liver were 
removed and replaced with a single organ this week 
the patient a 16yearold girl is reported doing fine 
the auxiliary liver really did function as a bridge said 
dr michael moritz assistant professor of surgery at thomas 
jefferson university in philadelphia during a coma an auxiliary 
transplant is less risky because it involves less surgery 
both groups achievements are exciting said dr j wesley 
alexander president of the american society of transplant surgeons 
it shows whats possible he said 
emond reported at the societys annual meeting that 10 livers 
have been split by university of chicago doctors since last summer 
fourteen of the 20 recipients were children 
in each case the larger right lobe of the liver went to the 
larger of the two patients emond said the results were much the 
same between the adults and children 
fifteen of the 20 patients are alive three of them with second 
transpants emond said one patient received a pareddown liver the 
second time around while the other two got fullsize organs 
the pareddown liver is among 18 transplanted by emond and his 
colleagues over the past few years into children unable to sustain 
the potentially long wait for a childsized organ the liver is 
unique among human organs in its regenerative ability 
patient survival is 79 percent for those receiving pareddown 
organs compared with 75 percent for split livers and 82 percent 
for fullsized organs at the university of chicago the major site 
for such transplants emond said 
livers are trimmed when there is only one suitable candidate and 
split when there are two emond said 
we can potentially split any liver he said since its a 
new technique we dont know all the possible ramifications were 
hesitant to use it except in relatively urgent cases 
but were incredibly confident and were likely to do more 
such measures would be unnecessary if more donor organs were 
available emond said half of all infants and toddlers awaiting a 
new liver are said to die 
of the 767 people waiting for liver transplants in the united 
states as of monday 229 were 18 or under according to the united 
network for organ sharing 
the excitingly good results of liver transplantation are 
resulting in a rapid increase in the number of potential patients 
who want to be treated emond said 
more and more transplants are being performed on patients with 
fulminant hepatic failure a condition in which the liver rapidly 
loses function as a result of viral infections such as hepatitis 
medication overdoses or mushroom poisoning victims sometimes lapse 
into comas as did the 16yearold in philadelphia 
moritz performed the transplant on the girl at thomas jefferson 
university hospital on wednesday a month after he inserted a donor 
liver below her own she had suffered from a disease in which 
copper accumulates in the organs 
moritz said he decided on a standard transplant because her 
auxiliary liver was deteriorating 
it was the second time moritz inserted an auxiliary liver known 
as a heterotopic transplant into a patient with fulminant hepatic 
failure the first case on dec 14 1988 involved a 19yearold 
woman who still has both her own liver and the auxiliary organ 
sandy evans of folcroft pa had been in a coma for 12 hours 
before the heterotopic transplant was performed her liver failure 
was due to hepatitis 
im doing just fine no complaints whatsoever she said in a 
phone interview thursday from her job as a medical secretary at the 
hospital 
ms evans and the 16yearold are believed to be the only people 
in the world to successfully undergo a heterotopic liver transplant 
for fulminant hepatic failure moritz said 
moritz said he has performed standard liver transplants on eight 
other patients with fulminant hepatic failure six of whom were in 
a coma and two who were close four of the eight are alive

after five rounds and 832 words the field of 
contestants in the 62nd national spelling bee was narrowed today to 
18 girls and 16 boys of whom 10 have taken part in the national 
competition before 
the winner was scheduled to be named after the final round later 
in the day 
among those remaining in contention was lisa m edwin of dwight 
ill one of the six 10yearolds who were among the 222 who began 
the competition on wednesday the youngest entry in the bee lisa 
ishimaru of sacramento calif was eliminated earlier in the day 
the competition is open to students who have not reached their 
16th birthday or passed beyond the 8th grade 
of the surviving contestants after the fifth round three were 
competing at the national level for the third time scott isaacs 
14 of englewood colo kanika bahl 13 of beavercreek ohio and 
robert pryor 12 of washington seven others were making their 
second appearance 
lisa the daughter of a state tax auditor in sacramento left 
out the e in yeomanry and joined 70 older competitors on 
the sidelines as a result of the fourth round earlier she had 
correctly spelled mountebank blolly and reflorescence 
yeomanry means a body of small landowners or a troop of soldiers 
lisa walked from the stage with a solemn face but showed no 
sign of dismay such as a visible slump or headshake as some of the 
other losers did 
the opening days competition winnowed a field of 222 the 
largest in the history of the event to 151 including lisa a 4th 
grader who studies the violin 
although she is the only 9yearold in this years bee 
competing with youngsters up through age 15 she is not the 
youngest in the history of the event iris liu of muncie ind was 
a few weeks short of her 9th birthday when she competed in last 
years field of 200 but she lost out on the first day stumbling 
over the word waywiser 
by the end of three rounds 601 words had been spelled compared 
with 485 last year 
the one tense moment of the day came when susan bonner 11 a 
6th grader from fort necessity la spelled scordatura so 
softly that it took the judges five minutes to figure out she had 
spelled it wrong 
susan sat nervously in a front seat as the judges played and 
replayed a tape recording then they rang the bell indicating a 
mistake she had used a t instead of a d in the word which 
means tuning an instrument to produce a special effect 
in one of the few quips injected into the serious business of 
spelling angela martin 14 of st petersburg fla borrowed a 
line from the television show wheel of fortune and exclaimed 
oh god can i buy a vowel when she was given the word 
boulevardier to spell even without any such help she spelled 
it right 
those eliminated in the first days spelling included three 
13yearolds who were competing in the bee for the second time 
travis p tharp of pensacola fla misspelled pluricellular 
ana m gordan of manchester nh stumbled over inumbrate and 
cheryl d frye of woodstock va went down on wokas a plant 
that grows wild in the west 
four of the six 10yearolds in the competition were eliminated 
malinda shepherd of burnsville nc was tripped up by 
seriatim cheryl klein of peculiar mo by rhizotomy 
laura nawojchik of leesburg va by bijouterie and emily j 
banwell of alamo calif by floccose 
also in the competition at the start were 24 who are 11 45 who 
are 12 89 who are 13 55 who are 14 and two who are 15 
nearly 9 million students participated at the local level in 
contests sponsored by scripps howard newspapers in 13 cities and by 
205 other daily weekly and sunday newspapers 
the winner will receive a cash award of 1500 other prizes are 
1000 for second 750 for third 500 for fourth 400 for fifth 
300 for sixth 200 for seventh through 10th 100 for 11th

thousands of presbyterians are coming to 
historic philadelphia to elect a new moderator to lead the fight to 
reverse the churchs membership decline 
the 622 official delegates to the general assembly of the 
presbyterian church usa will attend sessions beginning tuesday 
and running through june 14 a preassembly symposium begins friday 
the presbyterian church usa traces its origins to the first 
presbytery founded in philadelphia 283 years ago then a number of 
colonial churches some formed as early as 1683 banded together to 
form the denomination in the first general assembly held here in 
1789 
presbyterian membership grew to a high of more than 4 million in 
the mid1960s then began to fall to todays 2938830 members in 
11573 churches dwindling membership is a problem shared generally 
with all the longstanding denominations 
the rev c kenneth hall of butler pa current church 
moderator and presiding officer for the 201st general assembly 
believes the church needs to reclaim the powerful voice it once 
exerted on social economic and political issues if it wants to 
buck the trend 
our church is determined to turn this thing around which is 
why at our last assembly we established evangelism as one of our 
priorities and over the next five years we are going to commit 15 
million to bring in new members he said 
two men and two women face election wednesday to succeed hall as 
moderator 
they are the rev james johnson jr 61 pastor of the first 
presbyterian church columbus ga the rev joan salmon campbell 
51 associate executive for mission programs in the philadelphia 
presbytery the rev william skinner 56 pastor of the first 
presbyterian church sioux city iowa and ms agnes wilson elder 
in the second presbyterian church sumter sc 
also on the agenda is a proposal to increase annual per capita 
dues 16 cents to 355 the church budget is currently 116 
million 
opening friday is the threeday continue the journey a 
symposium on the future 
keynoter roger heyns former chancellor of the university of 
california at berkeley will discuss developments in science 
economics the arts education politics and technology and how 
they will shape the churchs future 
presenters include west germanys president richard von 
weizacker on global politics maxine singer president of the 
carnegie institution of washington on biology and health the rev 
patricia mcclurg president of the national council of churches of 
christ in the united states on religion shigekuni kawamura 
president of japan ink chemical industry on business and the 
worlds economy margaret mckenna president of lesly college on 
education and entertainer steve allen on communications 
because of the bicentennial flavor of this years meeting a 
number of social events are being planned for the 10000 delegates 
alternates their families and church members expected 
among the activities will be a weeklong gift to the city 
work on a lowcost housing project members of about 30 
presbyterian churches will contribute over 1200 hours of labor and 
some 100000 to five groups for lowcost housing to poor 
philadelphians 
although a oneweek effort cannot solve philadelphias housing 
crisis it can make a major impact said chairman george 
hollingshead jr associate pastor of suburban bryn mawr 
presbyterian church this project is also intended to be a model 
for future presbyterian national meetings in other cities

the interior department said thursday it is 
considering additional trade restrictions on african ivory but a 
conservation group said the need is for an immediate ban 
interior secretary manuel lujan saying he was outraged over 
the illegal poaching of african elephants for their ivory tusks 
said the bush administration was on the verge of expanding 
import controls 
but he said that no solution to the elephant problem can be 
effective without the full participation of the african nations 
that have elephants and other nations where demand for ivory is 
considerable 
lujan said the united states already prohibits ivory imports 
from more than 70 nations but that does not seem to be enough to 
curtail large amounts of ivory from coming into this country 
through commercial trade channels or illegally 
we have reason to believe that some of this ivory is from 
illegal trading and that the commercial trading is out of 
control said lujan in a statement 
an interior spokesman steve goldstein said one action being 
looked at very seriously is expanding the ivory import ban to 
nations such as japan where ivory does not originate but where 
businesses are heavily involved in the importing and exporting of 
ivory and ivory products 
according to the department the african elephant has declined 
in numbers from about 15 million a decade ago to fewer than 
700000 because of an onslaught by poachers interested only in the 
ivory tusks conservation groups suggest the number could be closer 
to 400000 
an international convention scheduled for october is likely to 
reach agreement on procedures aimed at permanently banning 
international commercial trading of african elephant ivory 
but officials of several conservation groups said thursday at a 
news conference that the expectation of such an action by 102 
nations in october could launch an elephant holocaust across 
africa by poachers seeking to beat the ban 
it is absolutely vital that the united states and the european 
community immediately ban ivory imports until international 
agreement can be reached in october said russell train chairman 
of the world wildlife fund he urged ivory importers in hong kong 
and japan where much of the ivory is made into jewelry and other 
items to take similar action 
david western director of wildlife conservation international 
said that industrial nations also should provide emergency funds to 
help african governments cope with the expected surge in poaching 
and smuggling of elephant ivory prior to the convention on 
international trade in endangered species 
the conference is expected to place the african elephant into a 
more protective category which would prohibit elephants from being 
killed for their ivory 
according to the conservation groups the volume of ivory 
exported from africa has steadily increased from 300 tons a year in 
the 1950s to more than 800 tons a year in recent years the volume 
has dropped somewhat during the last two years but 
conservationists attribute that largely to the rapidly dwindling 
supply of elephants 
in a related matter sen robert kasten rwis urged lujan in 
a letter thursday to immediately ban ivory imports and send a 
very strong signal about our commitment to the protection of the 
african elephant

mirage2000 combat jets it was reported thursday 
two of the frenchbuilt planes were damaged beyond repair and 
six others suffered extensive damage in the air forces biggest 
peacetime accident according to defense ministry sources quoted by 
the indian express 
damage to the mirages purchased in 1985 was estimated at 175

members of congress and thousands of other 
americans somberly bade farewell to rep claude pepper on thursday 
as the octogenarian champion of the elderly lay in state in the 
capitol rotunda 
peppers flagdraped casket was quietly carried into the rotunda 
by members of the four armed services and placed on a wooden 
catafalque draped in black velvet with silk cord and fringe 
peppers family members of congress and his staff encircled the 
open casket for a brief memorial service 
the 88yearold florida democrat who died of stomach cancer 
tuesday at walter reed army hospital is only one of 26 americans 
to lie in state in the rotunda and only the second to have his 
casket open as had army gen douglas h macarthur 
resigning house speaker jim wright lauded peppers optimism 
for the future and compassion for those less fortunate 
we who are his friends are richer for having known him said 
wright who said he became a disciple of pepper after first hearing 
him speak in 1944 
senate democratic leader george mitchell of maine added 
claude peppers death marks the passing of an era in american 
history to the 101st congress from the early days of the 
roosevelt administration when the energies of the federal 
government were turned to the tasks of dealing with a nation 
onethird illhoused illclothed and illfed claude pepper 
never forgot his duty as an elected official to fight for the 
common welfare 
vice president dan quayle told of president and mrs bush 
presenting pepper the congressional medal of freedom in his 
hospital bed shortly before his death 
at the end of the ceremony dennis cravedi a 6yearold student 
at woods academy in bethesda md placed his running medals in 
peppers casket son of the staff director of the subcommittee on 
health and longterm care the youth had wanted to present his 
medals to pepper before his death but never had an opportunity 
for five hours americans filed past the casket to view the 
body many had personal memories of pepper while others claimed 
only to benefit from his lifelong battles for social security and 
other pensions catastrophic health insurance and other laws aimed 
at helping the poor and the elderly

thomas of washington because of him i am able to live with my 
pensions its helpful for me and my wife

an woman who spent a record 130 days in a new 
mexico cave for an isolation experiment appears to be faring well 
after her underground stay doctors testing her for possible bone 
loss said thursday 
stefania follini 27 an interior decorator from ancona italy 
who volunteered for the job appeared happy and healthy thursday as 
she described the experiment as a positive experience and one she 
would repeat 
doctors checked ms follini to see if she lost any bone mass 
during her period of reduced activity and they are awaiting 
results from a battery of other physical tests 
she looks fine to me said dr adrian leblanc manager of 
nuclear medicine for houstons methodist hospital where ms 
follini was tested this week the only noticeable difference is her 
17pound weight loss she now weighs 90 pounds 
ms follini was a little confused about the passage of time at 
the end of her stay underground and when told she would be coming 
out may 22 she said she thought it was march 14 while sealed off 
from outside time clues her days had gradually lengthened as she 
stayed awake longer and longer 
she first reported having problems readjusting to a 24hour day 
but said thursday she had overcome most of those difficulties 
ms follini said through an interpreter that she is looking at 
the world with more attentiveness and curiosity than before her 
stay in the cave she also said noises seemed much louder since she 
emerged from the cave 
i can see now my attention is better she said 
the experiment was conducted by a nonprofit italian research 
group pioneer frontier exploration and researches which also has 
conducted other isolation projects similar to ms follinis 
on thursday she underwent a test that documented the amount of 
mineral in her bones the same test was done before she went 
underground for comparison 
leblanc said the results will be available in several days and 
will be turned over to the italian researchers 
i dont expect a large bone loss he said adding that any 
decrease should be restored naturally as ms follini gets back in 
her regular routine above ground 
a loss of calcium or other minerals in her bones could be 
attributed to a decrease in exercise ms follini said she 
exercised some in the cave but not as much as she normally does 
a decrease also could be caused by a lack of estrogen for 
reasons researchers have not yet determined ms follini didnt 
have a regular menstrual cycle during her underground stay 
dr andrea galvagno one of two italian researchers in houston 
to monitor ms follinis health said a loss of calcium also might 
be caused by the lack of sunlight 
leblanc said the results could help methodist researchers 
determine the effects of activity on bones the test performed on 
ms follini is the same one used to gauge osteoporosis the loss of 
bone mass in the elderly 
ms follini was to leave houston on saturday she and two 
italian researchers will attend a medical convention in paris 
before returning to italy 
she will undergo further tests in italy to help determine how 
well researchers prepared her psychologically for the underground 
stay said maurizio montalbini a psychologist overseeing the 
experiment 
after visiting with friends and enjoying the summer ms follini 
said she will look for a new job as an interior decorator she had 
to quit her previous job to do the experiment

the soviet leadership stung by accusations of 
complicity or coverup in a bloody military assault on georgian 
demonstrators in april took the extraordinary step thursday of 
revealing secret cables about it 
this is the original vice president anatoly i lukyanov 
told the hushed congress of peoples deputies holding up a cable 
in which the georgian communist party chief told the kremlin of the 
bloodshed at a proindependence demonstration six hours after it 
happened 
president mikhail s gorbachev told the deputies wednesday the 
cables established the need for a commission to investigate the 
matter 
he was responding to charges by yuri vlasov of moscow that 
gorbachev must know who was responsible for the order to clear 
rustavelli prospekt in tbilisi capital of the georgian republic 
other deputies have said a high official must have known in 
advance of the assault they demanded the official be identified 
the kremlin response emphasized the new parliaments power to 
demand explanations of government actions the public reading of 
three cables to moscow from former georgian party leader dzhumber 
patiashvili was an unprecedented revelation of documents 
traditionally kept secret 
soldiers dispersed thousands of proindependence demonstrators 
in tbilisi at 4 am april 9 and 20 civilians were killed 
lukyanov reading from the documents to the silent hall said 
patiashvili cabled moscow at 850 pm seven hours before the 
assault saying the situation was tense but under control 
there is no need for any kind of extra extreme measures from 
the central committee of the communist party or the government 
he read 
the next cable at 1025 am april 9 told moscow authorities 
of the casualties lukyanov said that appeared to support 
statements by gorbachev and other officials that they learned of 
the attack six hours after it happened 
these are the events as they developed gorbachev told the 
deputies wednesday we have to follow these events to their roots 
and clear it up take it to the supreme soviet and make whatever 
decision is necessary in this case 
the 2250member congress established its own commission to 
investigate 
col gen igor rodionov who commanded the soldiers in tbilisi 
told reporters the cables were authentic rodionov also is a 
deputy had a bitter exchange with patiashvili during the tuesday 
session about responsibility for the deaths 
patiashvili said rodionov and other military officials told a 
meeting of leaders in tbilisi they had orders from moscow to stop 
demonstrations that had gripped the city for almost a week 
on thursday rodionov said the cables to moscow accurately 
reflected the situation in tbilisi at the time but the situation 
deteriorated into a pure orgy with antisoviet slogans 
appeals to overturn the government appeals to exterminate 
communists and those who were opposed to them 
a georgian commission has accused the military of a planned 
massacre using shovels clubs and chemical substances 
rodionov told reporters thursday the victims in tbilisi were 
crushed to death not killed by soldiers he denied chemicals were 
used 
the version about gas was needed to create a picture of 
violence not a picture of resistance but a picture of violence 
against a holiday atmosphere where people were singing dancing 
and praying he said 
he said he would be satisfied with any national investigating 
group but did not trust the georgian commission which circulated 
its report at the congress

rightist alfredo cristiani 
assumed the presidency thursday and pledged to rescue the nation 
from its nineyear civil war and poverty 
the 41yearold businessman leader of the republican 
nationalist alliance or arena offered marxistled guerrillas 
immediate dialogue on ending the war but he made it clear he would 
not negotiate government policy or share power 
in this moment of assuming leadership we are the enemies of 
no one cristiani said we are not asking for anyones 
surrender 
but we also cannot permit that social harmony be achieved 
through violating the law we have sworn to uphold the constitition 
and the law and that we will do 
the guerrilla group farabundo marti national liberation front 
said on its clandestine radio arena means war poverty and 
totalitarianism 
el salvadors civil war has killed an estimated 70000 people 
most of them civilians 
cristianis inauguration ceremony was held at the capitals 
international fairgrounds before about 6000 people 
the presidents of guatemala costa rica and honduras attended 
and 33 other countries sent delegations the us delegation was 
headed by sen richard lugar rind 
electricity for the ceremony had to be provided by generators 
powered by gasoline and diesel because guerrilla sabotage overnight 
left 90 percent of the country which is about the size of 
massachusetts without power the rebels have vowed to make the 
country ungovernable 
cristianis 45minute inaugural speech was a tribute to free 
enterprise and what he believed conservative economic policy will 
do to revive the nations economy 
but he also promised a judiciary more effectual each day and 
ever greater respect for human rights 
the us government has supported the christian democrats the 
party of outgoing president jose napoleon duarte and has expressed 
concern about an eventual rise in human rights abuses under arena 
arena was founded in 1981 by former army major and alleged 
deathsquad kingpin roberto daubuisson who is still hailed by 
stalwarts as the partys maximum leader 
rightist death squads are blamed for more than 20000 deaths in 
the early 1980s daubuisson and arena deny any connection with the 
squads and say arena because of its nationalism has been 
slandered by christian democrats the foreign press and human 
rights organizations 
cristiani dedicated several minutes of his speech to the rights 
issue in an apparent attempt to allay fears 
daubuisson was hailed with thunderous applause and chants of 
his surname twice during the ceremony he responded a beaming smile 
and a raised clenched fist 
cristiani decried the corruption perceived as rampant in the 
administration of duarte and promised his government would be based 
on liberty honesty legality and security 
duarte who is dying of cancer sat impassively on the dais next 
to cristiani before he took the oath and received the presidential 
sash 
francisco merino 37 was sworn in as vice president 
corruption as well as duartes failure to end the war and 
improve the economy contributed to arenas landslide victory in 
the march 19 presidential election 
the christian democrats nationalized banks and the crop export 
business cristiani promised to return both industries to the 
private sector 
but he said arena has no intention of rolling back an agrarian 
reform program that has during the past decade redistributed a 
third of the nations arable land 
marxist war has no future in el salvador cristiani said 
we will work for understanding with all sectors of society the 
fmln is one of those sectors and we will pursue immediate contact 
with them 
cristiani also said he would create a national emergency 
program to create productive jobs he did not give specifics 
half of the working class does not have fulltime jobs 
cristiani said particular attention would be paid to the 
poorest of the poor and peasant farmers who make up just more 
than half of the population of 55 million

republican image makers are moving quickly to 
exploit the ethics problems of house democratic leaders urging gop 
lawmakers to use them as an argument the democrats have held 
control too long 
power tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely 
says a briefing paper circulated quietly among republican 
congressmen wednesday as speaker jim wright dtexas prepared to 
resign 
the quote from lord acton the 19th century historian was 
accompanied by repeated hints that the answer to the ethics mess 
could be a switch from democratic dominance in the house to 
republican control 
the resignation of two of the top three democrats in the house 
is the bitter fruit of 35 years of democratic control of that 
body said the paper designed to arm gop lawmakers in the war of 
words raging over house ethics 
it suggested that they say the wright resignation only days 
after majority whip tony coelho said he would leave the house 
rather than prolong the ethics issue in an expected investigation 
of his financial dealings represented a genuinely sad moment in 
our nations history 
but it also suggested the republican house members who will be 
up for reelection next year give their version of who was at 
fault 
democrats would have the news media and the american people 
think that wright and coelhos fall has to do with ethical 
mccarthyism and character assassination said the paper this 
is absolutely false jim wright and tony coelhos falls were 
character suicides 
the paper was issued by the national republican congressional 
committee which raises money prepares statements and videos does 
polling and research and other projects aimed at helping house 
republicans polish their political image house democrats and both 
parties in the senate maintain similar committees 
committee spokesman john buckley said he wrote the paper on 
tuesday and it was intended primarily for the eyes of gop 
congressmen obviously it wasnt intended to be provided to a 
reporter he said 
house democratic leader thomas foley of washington who will 
take wrights place as speaker called for conciliation thursday 
but rep gary ackerman dny said of the atmosphere in the 
house democrats are trying to act with restraint but there 
comes a time when people are going to push back and push back 
awfully hard 
in new york ronald h brown chairman of the democratic 
national committee used a commencement address at hunter college 
to chastise the gop though he made no mention of the congressional 
committees paper 
republican operatives are happy to leave the world of idealism 
and progress behid for the cynical world of sound bites and media 
manipulation not content with the negative ads they used to 
cheapen the 1988 presidential campaign they want to debase all 
politics now ideas and actions just get in their way brown said 
democrats have led the charge for ethics legislation and 
campaign finance reform he said time after time we proposed 
reform legislation time after time republicans fought it 
the gop paper was similar in some ways to dozens of others 
turned out by the committee but in this case it documented the 
partisan tone that has saturated the debate over house ethics 
it summarized allegations against coelho but did not tackle the 
more tangled specifics that led to wrights resignation 
it merely advised republican congressmen to say that the next 
speaker must address the very real need for reform in the 
house then it returned to its main point the democrats in the 
house have grown arrogant with their unchallenged power 
why did two prominent intelligent members of the democratic 
leadership get into this bind it asked because there may hae 
been a feeling of invulnerability when you can absue the rights of 
the minority for as long as they have there could well be a 
feeling that you can do what you want ethics be damned

the house rules committee cleared the way 
thursday for floor action on a bill to restrict the 6 billion fsx 
fighter deal with japan 
under a rule adopted by the panel on a voice vote the house is 
scheduled tuesday to take up a senatepassed resolution sponsored 
by sen robert c byrd dwva that sets conditions for 
coproduction of the fsx an advanced version of the us f16 
byrds measure would prohibit transfer of critical american jet 
engine technology to japan and also would bar japan from selling or 
transferring the fsx or its technology to a third country 
the bush administration has voiced strong opposition to the 
resolution saying it would infringe on the presidents 
constitutional powers to conduct negotiations with foreign nations 
the house also will consider a substitute measure approved by 
the house foreign affairs committee and sponsored by rep stephen 
j solarz dny chairman of the panels asian and pacific 
affairs subcommittee 
solarzs measure would make two major changes in the byrd 
resolution 
on critical engine technology changing the flat prohibition to 
an expression of congressional sentiment that such technology 
should not be transferred and giving the house and senate a chance 
to veto the arrangement if a transfer were approved 
on sale of the fsx or its technology to a third country 
removing the ban but setting up a mechanism for congress to 
disapprove such a sale if the president were to approve it 
in addition the house will consider a nonbinding 
senseofcongress resolution sponsored by rep gerald bh solomon 
rny expressing disapproval of the fsx agreement 
under the deal general dynamics would join with japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries to codevelop and coproduce the fsx for 
deployment by japan in the late 1990s general dynamics is 
headquartered in st louis but most of the fsx work would be done 
at its f16 plant in fort worth texas

four haitians were in jail thursday 
on air piracy charges after trying to hijack to new york an 
antillean airlines flight enroute from haiti to this dutch 
caribbean island 
police said the four were not armed when they attempted to 
hijack alm flight 974 wednesday night the plane left miami between 
4 pm and 5 pm for curacao with a stopover in haiti 
they wanted to go to new york and were under the impression 
that they were going to new york the airlines spokesman robin 
visser said thursday he said the planes captain fooled the 
hijackers into believing the airport in curacao was really new york 
visser said wednesday night that the hijackers ultimately wanted 
to be flown to israel 
he said that after the plane left haiti a haitian man told a 
flight attendant he had put in a bathroom a box of explosives that 
could be detonated by a haitian army colonel in a submarine 
somewhere in the caribbean 
after the haitians were arrested in curacao when the plane 
arrived the crew found a small box in the bathroom police said 
thursday they were still investigating its contents 
attorney general robert pietersz thursday identified the groups 
leader as joseph pierre lamy 37 he said the other three were a 
29yearold man and two women aged 27 and 35 he said he did not 
know the names of the three 
he said the four have been charged with air piracy and will be 
tried in curacao 
he said they face a maximum sentence of 10 years he said 
authorities still have not determined the motive for the hijacking 
partly due to trouble communicating with the haitians who speak 
only creole and broken french 
visser said the dc9 super 80 returned to normal service 
thursday 
he said one of the estimated 100 passengers was slightly injured 
wednesday night in the rush to leave the plane after the captain 
ordered its immediate evacuation after landing

house speaker jim wright proclaimed himself 
liberated thursday after his announcement he will resign from 
congress while there were clear signs his leaving wouldnt end the 
partisan bitterness that focused on his ethics case 
wright put the best face on his departure blaming not only 
republicans for his downfall but also his own inner drive to do too 
much too quickly to make things happen in the way that you 
believe in 
in a lengthy interview he never suggested he had done anything 
wrong 
his likely successor majority leader thomas foley of 
washington was talking of ways to calm the fractious house and 
cool vindictiveness left over from the wright ethics case 
i think we can turn this mood that has somehow affected the 
institution a bit recently back to a strong and healthy one said 
foley who is virtually certain to be chosen speaker by democratic 
colleagues tuesday when wright relinquishes the job 
rep richard gephardt dmo was considered the favorite to 
replace foley as majority leader later on but rep ed jenkins 
dga was also seeking fellow democrats support 
four prominent democrats were working their house precinct for 
the no 3 spot now held by rep tony coelho of california who 
said last weekend he will resign rather than face likely ethics 
charges concerning his own financial dealilngs 
the four reps william gray of pennsylvania david bonior of 
michigan beryl anthony of arkansas and henry waxman of california 
while foley talked of peace there was evidence a recent 
eyeforaneye atmosphere was far from gone 
republicans circulated a private briefing paper advising their 
colleagues on how to best use wrights problems in the favorite 
argument of gop whip newt gingrich of georgia wrights chief 
accuser the paper contended the democrats have problems because of 
their 35year tenure in control of the house 
the democrats in the house have grown arrogant with their 
unchallenged power the paper stated suggesting that exploiting 
ethics matters might be a way to help the gop regain majority 
status 
john buckley a spokesman for the national republican 
congressional committee said the gop was fully prepared to take 
advantage of the revelations about democrats but he denied there 
was any special campaignstyle effort to dig up new dirt on the 
opposition 
house members said thursday that wrights resignation 
announcement had relieved tension but some also said it was being 
replaced by anger much of it aimed at gingrich 
its a world war i mentality where anyone who sticks his head 
out of the trench might get it shot at next said rep leon 
panetta dcalif 
gingrichs case is likely to be the next to go before the ethics 
panel he is accused of putting together a partnership to promote a 
book he wrote a venture which employed his wife and of violating 
limits on outside income and prohibitions on receiving gifts over 
100 from people with a direct interest in legislation 
the issues are strikingly parallel to the wright case gingrich 
denies any wrongdoing 
the georgian who had kept silent since hearing wrights 
resignation speech said thursday that he had held his tongue at 
first because i was so angry at the tone of his speech and some 
of the things he said 
he said wrights condemnation of ethics accusations and 
investigations as mindless cannibalism was an insult to the 
ethics committee and every decent person in the house it was 
not mindless it was very serious 
rep john t myers rind the senior gop member of the ethics 
committee said he expected the panel still to act next week on 
motions made by wrights lawyers to dismiss the most serious 
charges against him he too said he resented wrights comment 
were doing our job he said if a member has done wrong 
its got to be investigated i do not consider myself 
cannibalistic i resent that comment im not going to be 
intimidated 
wright meanwhile said i feel liberated and planned to do 
a lot of things i enjoy in life and have been postponing to read 
reflect and be with friends in a leisurely setting 
he said he planned to do some writing and some speaking if 
invited 
and he said he hoped his resignation would lead to an 
abatement of the stridency and the pettiness which has grown up 
like weeds in our garden 
in an interview in his office wright dated his misfortunes from 
nov 13 1987 when he attended a meeting between nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega and roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo in washington 
from that moment there was nothing but hostility from the 
administration wright said there was a determination on the 
part of certain people in the other party to see to it that i was 
removed 
he said he made up his mind to resign last weekend 
it had come to me that it would be unreasonable to expect 
to prevail upon the members of the ethics committee to see that 
they had been in error wright said short of an allout 
harsh bitter fight on the house floor it would be unrealistic to 
expect a complete exoneration which is all i was interested in so 
i decided thats one of those things i cant change 
during his time as speaker he said i was probably obsessed 
with the notion that i had a limited period of time in which to 
make my mark on the future that was one of my attitudes perhaps a 
failing 
he said there has to come an end there must come an end to 
the use of ethics as a political weapon do i believe thats 
going to happen overnight because i said it no i do not

the christian cabinet said thursday it 
welcomes the arab leagues plan to pursue a settlement of lebanons 
14yearold civil war as the competing moslem government had done 
a week ago 
gen michel aouns christian administration called for 
consolidating a ceasefire proclaimed by the arab leaders last 
friday after a fourday summit in morocco 
premier salim hoss who heads the rival moslem cabinet approved 
the summits decisions hours after they were made on thursday his 
government recommended speeding up implementation of the 
resolutions 
the competing governments have existed since a political crisis 
developed in september 
several formations of israeli jets roared over beirut after 
sunset thursday drawing antiaircraft fire from both christian and 
moslem forces police said it may have been the first time aouns 
gunners fired at israeli warplanes which have patrolled lebanon 
for years 
press reports said the siege of the christian enclave east of 
beirut might be lifted next week because of the arab leagues 
efforts 
moslem forces sealed off the 310squaremile area soon after 
artillery duels began march 8 between aouns christian army units 
and an alliance of syrian troops and druse militiamen 
although the arab league declared a truce in april syrian 
gunners have continued shelling the christian coastline northeast 
of beirut to keep aouns forces from bringing in supplies 
a statement issued after the christian governments threehour 
meeting demanded the siege be lifted and said aouns 20000 
soldiers were willing to end their blockade of illegal ports run by 
moslem militias the blockade was imposed march 6 and the artillery 
war began two days later 
aouns cabinet said it welcomes the wresting of the lebanese 
problem from syrias monopolizing fist 
at the summit king hassan ii of morocco king fahd of saudi 
arabia and the president of algeria chadli bendjedid were 
designated to find a settlement in lebanon within six months 
the christian statement said the three leaders enjoy the 
confidence and respect of the lebanese people 
it said christians would not discuss changes in the political 
system which the moslem majority demands until the syrians 
withdrew from lebanon 
christians were the majority when lebanon became independent of 
france in 1943 and have dominated the government military and 
judiciary under an unwritten agreement the president is 
christian the premier sunni moslem and the parliament speaker 
shiite moslem 
syria has 40000 soldiers in lebanon under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 and has become the main power 
broker during the long civil war 
not long after the artillery battles began aoun declared a 
war of liberation against the syrians the statement thursday 
said the lebanese people can freely express their opinions 
in reforming their domestic affairs only after the removal of 
the occupation 
also included in the statement was an accusation that syria was 
behind a plot to kill aoun 
it called the plot a clear symbol of syrian terrorism to 
eliminate the head of the legal authority 
the christian government said it would seek the extradition from 
cyprus of six lebanese arrested in larnaca cyprus last friday 
with a large cache of weapons including antiaircraft missiles 
the moslem cabinet also has requested extradition 
one of the six told a court hearing they had planned to shoot 
down a helicopter carrying aoun to cyprus aoun was expected to 
pass through larnaca on his way to the arab summit but did not 
attend the meeting

private exporters report that china has bought 
an additional 100000 metric tons of soft red winter wheat raising 
its total tonnage for the new marketing year to 850000 the

nonsubsidized 550000 tons of wheat to be about 825 million 
during the last marketing year china bought 83 million metric 
tons of wheat said a department statistician who noted that the

actor jason robards and author alex haley are 
going to try to persuade bell atlantic customers they need 
intelligent telephone services that can tell them whos calling 
before they answer and automatically dial whoever called while they 
were in the shower

advertising campaign in which they extoll the virtues of bell 
atlantics intelligent networq of phone services for businesses 
and homes bell atlantic said thursday 
the system can display the number of a caller before you answer 
dial back that caller who hung up before you were able to reach the 
phone and screen out people you dont want to talk to it also 
will give customers distinctive rings for certain calls and have as 
many as three different telephone numbers ring on one phone 
it will change the way people live and do business by making 
communication simpler and easier christopher e clouser bell 
atlantics vice president for corporate relations and advertising 
said of the advanced communications system to convey this 
revolutionary concept to consumers we chose two wellknown and 
wellrespected communications experts a noted author and an 
actor 
haley wrote the book roots while robards has had a long 
motion picture television and stage career 
bell atlantic is not the first company to offer these socalled 
class services and to date the public has not rushed out to 
embrace them

making such services available in early 1988 but has signed up only 
24 percent of its 13 million customers the wall street journal 
reported last month

after more than a decade 288 percent of bell customers have call 
waiting 10 percent have call forwarding and 74 percent have 
threeway calling

identify or block unwanted calls but the phone companies say their 
way is easier and more efficient

jury deliberations began thursday in 
the bank robbery trial of two men one of whom is also accused of 
murdering a gang member to keep him from testifying 
john p mccoy 43 of slaters branch and david doyle moore 27 
of lovely are accused of robbing the matewan national bank branch 
at kermit on jan 3 1987 making off with 286000 in what was 
west virginias largest bank robbery the pair also is charged with 
threatening federal witnesses 
mccoy is also charged with shooting to death russell m davis 
who was allegedly part of the robbery gang because he talked to 
investigators 
us attorney michael carey said in closing arguments that 
testimony linked mccoy to the robbery the threats and the death of 
davis 
carey said moore stole the getaway car took part in the robbery 
and went with mccoy to make threats against at least one witness 
you will find that theyre not only guilty beyond a reasonable 
doubt theyre guilty beyond any doubt carey said 
that account was rebutted by defense attorney roy hampton 
appointed last monday to represent mccoy who previously had 
refused government help 
hampton said the key government witness harold d boonie 
runyon lacked credibility and had changed his story since talking 
to the grand jury in an attempt to avoid kentuckys electric chair 
runyon pleaded guilty two weeks ago to killing davis on a 
mountaintop in kentucky he charged that mccoy killed davis with a 
shot to the head after runyon had shot davis three times in the 
back and testified he had helped bury another man in a separate 
incident in kentucky 
mr runyon was involved in another murder this is the kind of 
person the government is asking you to believe hampton said 
j william curtis representing moore said the government made 
a mistake in its opening argument in saying that it would prove his 
client stole a vehicle for the getaway 
hes guilty of no more than being friends with john p 
mccoy curtis said 
a jewelry store operator said moore purchased more than 2000 
in jewelry the afternoon of the robbery but curtis said the 
jewelers recollection was wrong other witnesses in the trial said 
moore also bought a used car the day of the robbery 
the trial in federal court began last week under tight security 
because of the alleged threats against witnesses the courtroom 
halls were lined with a metal detector an xray machine and a 
handful of federal agents 
the jury was given the case thursday afternoon and the judge 
immediately recessed proceedings until friday morning

a factfinding mission from the 
european parliament abandoned efforts to check on human rights 
abuses reported in kosovo province and left belgrade on thursday 
its task unfulfilled a member said 
danish deputy frode kristoffersen said authorities thwarted 
attempts by the fivemember delegation to meet ethnic albanian 
dissidents 
a senior police officer in pristina capital of the troubled 
southern province said after the detention of about 80 students on 
thursday that police in kosovo are determined to quell further 
unrest he said police raided pristina university dormitories early 
thursday detaining suspected leaders of the unrest 
the action prompted most of the 4500 students to leave the 
university hostels for home in fear of reprisals 
the students had defied emergency measures forbidding 
demonstrations in the province to protest alleged harassment of 
ethnic albanians by yugoslav authorities 
we are leaving with our task unfulfilled and with a feeling of 
frustration because we were not given a chance to meet with people 
in kosovo who hold opinions which differ from official ones 
kristoffersen said 
we will recommend that another european delegation visit 
kosovo this fall to further study the situation 
a state of emergency was proclaimed in kosovo two months ago 
when 60000 ethnic albanians demonstrated to protest constitutional 
changes limiting selfgovernment here and giving the republic of 
serbia of which kosovo is a part a greater say in kosovos

an international panel has backed an 
australian charge that the united states violated trading rules by 
limiting its imports of sugar the office of us trade 
representative carla hills said thursday 
last week ms hills cited japan brazil and india as 
unreasonably limiting exports from the united states she acted 
under a new us trade law with the approval of president bush 
christina mccowan a press officer for ms hills said the 
ruling on sugar will come up at a meeting in geneva switzerland on 
june 21 the scene will be a meeting of the council of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade gatt which is an international 
organization as well as an agreement 
gatt permits restrictions on imports only if the importing 
country restricts its own production in the same proportion it is 
considered unfair for the limit on imports to be used just as a way 
to protect the importing countrys own industry or farmers 
weve been increasing our production while cutting our 
imports said tom hammer president of the us sweetener users 
association 
american users of sweeteners and sugar exporters in other 
countries say the price of sugar in the united states is kept 
unreasonably high by government action to protect a small number of 
us farmers the us government last year raised its price to 23 
cents a pound raw cane sugar sells at about 11 cents a pound on 
the world market 
hammer said us imports of sugar have been reduced from 11 
billion worth in 1982 to about 400 million last year quotas 
specifying how much sugar may be sold in this country are 
distributed among 38 countries including australia 
canada argentina and the 12 countries of the european economic 
community joined australia in filing a complaint last year the 
panel that ruled against the united states consisted of poland 
uruguay and hong kong 
under gatt rules the united states or any of the other 96 
member governments in the organization could block acceptance of 
the sugar panels ruling in recent years however the united 
states and japan have accepted some adverse rulings the united 
states has been in the forefront of a successful movement to 
tighten the system for settling disputes under gatt 
in two other pending cases the administration has accepted an 
adverse ruling but no change has been made in the practises 
complained of because congress had not acted to change the law 
gatt rules also call for the country found in violation to offer 
compensation to the country whose exports have been restricted 
compensation usually takes the form of a reduced tariff in the 
country found at fault on other goods of the complaining country 
or some measure that also increases the complaining countrys 
exports

house republican leader bob michel asked the 
attorney general thursday to weigh very carefully democratic 
rep william grays request for an independent counsel into leaked 
information leading to stories that gray is under federal 
investigation 
michel sounding as angry as gray about the leaks wrote 
attorney general dick thornburgh i must believe that you are as 
upset as i am over any improper disclosure of information 
gray the fourthranking democrat who is running for the no 3 
majority whips position also continued on the offensive in 
denying reports that he had had any absentee workers on his payroll 
government sources speaking only on condition they not be 
named said there is a preliminary inquiry into allegations of 
employment practices and expenditures on grays staff including 
allegations that the lawmaker hired a ghost employee 
there are and were no ghost noshow or absentee 
emplouyees on my house or committee payrolls said gray who was 
chairman of the house budget committee prior to the current 
congressional session 
gray has asked thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel to 
investigate the leaks and the motivations of this socalled 
investigation arranged to occur just as i was seeking a leadership 
position in the democratic party 
he called thornburghs promise to have an inhouse 
investigatiion insufficient 
gray also gave reporters affidavits from all his employees who 
provided details on the work they do for congress 
michel rill told thornburgh he was very dismayed to hear 
news reports of allegations against gray which were apparently 
based on information from the justice department investigators and 
the office of the us attorney in philadelphia it is just hard to 
imagine anything more irreponsible 
he said if there is the slightest doubt that a complete 
investigation cannot be completed then i urge you to weigh very 
seriously the request you apparently have for an independent 
investigation 
justice department spokesman david runkel said we have 
confidence that this matter can be investigated here in this 
department 
previously the attorney general has made known his views of 
independent counsels to the point of suspending the order which 
would have ironically provided for the appointment of independent 
counsels for some of these matters that have been subject of 
leaks runkel said 
runkel was referring to an order issued by thornburghs 
predecessor edwin meese iii mandating appointment of independent 
counsels for investigations of members of congress

in another attack on official history two 
deputies told the soviet congress on thursday the baltic republics 
were taken by force and the approved version that they joined the 
soviet union voluntarily is a lie 
other stinging commentary during the session included an attack 
on poliburo member yegor k ligachev who was accused of being 
incompetent to run soviet agriculture and end chronic food 
shortages 
dissident historian roy medvedev took the podium during 
nationally televised debate and said the official version of soviet 
absorption of the three baltic republics in 1940 was not true 
up to now in our history books we have said estonia latvia 
and lithuania voluntarily joined the soviet union and that it was a 
popular revolution there was no violence and it was a declaration 
of free will he told the deputies 
that medvedev said was a lie 
many deputies reacted with noisy anger and denials then 
president mikhail s gorbachev declared his support for an 
investigation of the allegations and the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies assented without a vote 
gorbachev also implied the hitlerstalin pact of 1939 which 
doomed baltic sovereignty might be a forgery 
he said neither the soviet union nor west germany possesses an 
original there are copies of what i do not know gorbachev 
said 
one cause for skepticism he told the assembly is the fact that 
vyacheslav molotovs signature on the copy is in german rather than 
russian molotov then foreign minister negotiated the 
nonaggression treaty with his german counterpart joachim von 
ribbentrop 
latvian deputy jemma skulma said later the original is not 
needed to prove the soviets used force i was there the 
graying artist said 
gorbachev said he did not believe baltic charges with which 
western historians agree that nazi dictator adolf hitler and 
soviet dictator josef stalin divided poland and gave the baltics to 
the soviet union in a secret part of the agreement 
he said he supported an investigation because the baltics are 
in turmoil discussing these matters and it is doubted that there 
was a desire of the people to join the soviet union 
it is a burning issue in latvia lithuania and estonia where 
tens of thousands of people were deported and died in the 1940s and 
1950s mass movements in the republics are using gorbachevs 
reforms to press for independence 
the united states never recognized the soviet takeover of the 
baltic states and still accredits their old embassies in washington 
behind the scenes economist mihhail bronstein of estonia said 
gorbachev offered his support to estonias economic plan to 
legalize smallscale private property and give itself control of 
its industry and resources 
during the session heads swiveled toward ligachev as deputy 
yuri d chernichenko took the podium and began his scathing 
assessment of ligachevs performance as head of a new party 
commission on agriculture ligachev a conservative who is 
considered a rival to gorbachev sat impassively with other members 
of the ruling poliburo 
such remarks were never heard in the old parliament the supreme 
soviet which even party leaders and parliamentarians now admit was 
a mere rubberstamp body 
why is this politically significant branch the branch which 
determines the future ruled by a person who does not understand 
anything about it and who failed in the field of ideology 
chernichenko asked 
ligachev was named head of the commission in september after 
being relieved of the ideology portfolio the position that once 
made him the no 2 kremlin leader 
nothing in ligachevs background marks him as a specialist on 
farming he attended an institute on aircraft construction 
because of the nations dependence on imports of consumer goods 
and food it has the reputation of an international sponger 
said chernichenko a television commentator who specializes in 
agriculture and rural issues 
expensive projects in a deficitridden economy also were a 
common complaint thursday and some of gorbachevs reforms came 
under attack 
deputy vitaly kanishev received wild applause when he said new 
private cooperatives not only get their hands into our pockets 
they undress us and want to kill us too 
how much does the maintenance of 18 million bureaucrats cost 
and the war in afghanistan support for cuba nicaragua 
ethiopia asked deputy vasily belov how much is the space 
program how much are our grandiose festivals olympic games 
various forums 
nearly 50 deputies led by populist boris yeltsin and economist 
gavril popov proposing increasing the minimum pension to 80 rubles 
or 121 a month 
they also called for a system of guaranteeing of food products 
at state prices to retirees invalids and families with incomes of 
less than 106 a month per person 
the inaugural session of the congress was to have ended 
wednesday but more than 500 people were still seeking the floor 
thursday and the state broadcasting authority said it would 
continue its live broadcasts of the proceedings next week

the united states is continuing to press 
thailand about repatriating some 270 of its citizens who work at a 
libyan chemical weapons production plant state department sources 
said thursday 
so far the thai government has refused to take action on the 
us requests which have been made over the past several months 
weve made our concerns known through the appropriate 
officials and not at a low level said the official who 
spoke on condition of not being identified by name 
there are estimates that between 25000 and 75000 thais work in 
libya workers from many asian nations have sought employment in 
the middle east where they can obtain higherpaying jobs than in 
their homelands 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi has threatened action against 
other thais in libya if the workers at the chemical plant leave 
the plant has been identified by us officials as the largest 
single chemical weapons facility in the third world 
state department spokesman richard boucher asked about the 
matter said the united states has often expressed its concern 
about the plant and called on all nations to ensure that their 
firms and individuals are not contributing to the libyan chemical 
weapons program 
the royal thai government is well aware of our views on this 
issue and is aware as many other governments are of our serious 
concerns about the presence of workers at rabta including thai 
workers boucher said 
the spokesman refused to confirm that there have been repeated 
us requests of late on the matter saying only weve had 
discussions with the thai government as well as other governments 
and we hope that the thai government and other governments will 
continue to take action to deny foreign support to this plant

mayor henry cisneros who became one of the 
countrys most visible hispanic leaders only to see his eightyear 
term beclouded by scandal and personal problems finished his last 
day of work thursday 
cisneros 41 cleared out his desk and turned the job over to 
his predecessor lila cockrell who last month was elected again to 
the post she held from 1975 to 1981 she officially took over 
thursday afternoon 
in recent months cisneros marital problems he admitted being 
in love with another woman and the highly publicized reports of 
his sons ill health forced the usually outspoken mayor into a 
lower profile 
citing such personal problems cisneros announced last fall he 
would not run for a fifth term 
but friends and colleagues say cisneros will be remembered for 
working hard and bringing acclaim and businesses to the city 
theres no question he has left his mark on san antonio but 
he certainly has not ridden off into the sunset said longtime 
friend rep hugo berlanga after six years as a councilman and 
eight more as mayor cisneros plans to join an asset management 
firm in san antonio 
i suppose the thing that im proudest of is having worked with 
san antonians to raise our sense of the citys role and to overcome 
the kind of inwardlooking tendencies cisneros said in a 
newspaper interview 
some of the things i wanted to do in terms of clearance of 
entire blocks and replacing them with new housing in the central 
city have not yet occurred cisneros said 
the ivy leagueeducated san antonio native who still lives in 
his grandfathers house is credited with helping break down racial 
barriers between hispanics and anglos and inspiring a generation of 
young hispanics to finish school and join the professional ranks 
he bridged the gap between ethnic groups in a very articulate 
and charismatic way said city councilman weir labatt 
he has the charisma and the presence that very few people 
have said texas house speaker gib lewis when henry cisneros 
walks into a room he reminds me of john connally when he was 
governor throughout his political career everyone stopped and 
noticed henry cisneros has that 
cisneros brought national prominence to san antonio when he was 
rumored to be a vice presidential contender in 1984 he worked to 
develop a better bus system a stronger economic base and other 
community projects 
during his tenure the citys general expenditures grew from 
184 million in 1981 to 257 million last year tourism revenues 
grew from 654 million in 1980 to a projected 15 billion this 
year and the number of jobs in san antonio increased from 781200 
in 1980 to more than 1 million in 1988 with the addition of 13 new 
major employers 
but his political future remains uncertain 
i have no plan no timetable no deadline no office in 
mind cisneros said

exhausted by cancer calamity 
and revolution president jose napoleon duarte completed on 
thursday what may be his greatest victory peacefully turning his 
government over to an elected successor 
he yielded power to alfredo cristiani the new president who 
represents duartes nemesis on the right wing 
duartes closest political adviser commenting on condition his 
name not be used said that with the presidents ebbing strength 
duarte is given to reflecting on the fruits of his crusade for 
democracy in el salvador 
he feels ambivalent because he began by taking power away 
from the oligarchy and now it may seem hes handing it back the 
adviser told the associated press 
he is aware of the irony in the fact that handing power to the 
most disagreeable political opposition will consolidate the 
democratic process he has dedicated his life to building 
the adviser an old friend and fellow founder of the christian 
democratic party sees duarte almost daily though he has no 
government post he became the main architect of the transition 
he described how duarte has had to lie in an oxygen tent wasted 
by dehydrating vomiting and diarrhea like the ulcers in duartes 
mouth they are brought on by chemotherapy 
the 63yearold engineerturnedpolitician is likely to be 
remembered as crucial to a gradual and difficult replacement of an 
authoritarian semifeudal system of government with an incipient 
democracy 
but he approached the end of his term and his life burdened by 
failures and compromises that will weigh heavily as history 
deliberates its verdict 
duarte has terminal liver cancer since it was diagnosed in june 
1988 he has made periodic trips to walter reed army medical center 
in washington for treatment which leaves him bedridden 
with rest and intravenous nourishment he overcame the previous 
bouts of chemotherapy and returned to government 
his doctor jose luis saca told the ap the latest round of 
chemotherapy was particularly devastating duarte is given little 
or no chance of reaching his 64th birthday in november 
duarte considers himself to a great degree personally 
responsible for conditions permitting the unprecedented succession 
and sees it as a crowning achievement 
but he also considers cristianis republican nationalist 
alliance or arena an authoritarian antidemocratic party inclined 
to erode gains in human rights and civil liberties 
one must acknowledge president duartes democratic vocation 
said cristiani in an interview with foreign correspondents before 
taking office he has with his aptitudes and positions promoted 
democracy but i wouldnt go so far as to call him the father of 
salvadoran democracy 
a summation of duartes fiveyear term includes notable 
expansion of freedom of expression drastic reduction in 
politically motivated murders labor union pluralism and three 
nationwide elections judged free and fair by international 
observers 
but his two main objectives ending civil war and reviving a 
moribund economy remained at least as far from fulfillment as 
when he took office 
marxistled guerrillas have been waging a revolution against the 
usbacked government for nine years despite more than 35 
billion in economic and military aid from washington the rebels 
continue to dominate a wide swath of territory in the north and 
east 
though the 7000 insurgents are outnumbered eighttoone by 
security forces they have demonstrated the capacity to attack 
major garrisons and keep the army on the defensive in much of the 
massachusettssized country 
the economy is a shambles el salvador would be virtually 
bankrupt without international help production of the major export 
crops coffee sugar and cotton has declined sharply along with 
private investment and the standard of living 
health care potable water and primary education are little more 
than dreams for most of the rural population corruption and 
nepotism within duartes administration are either rampant or 
widespread depending on who is making the assessment 
the judiciary is all but completely ineffective though death 
squad activity has declined politically motivated assassins 
continue to murder with impunity 
duarte aware of the gravity of his disease offered in last 
years stateoftherepublic address a sort of balance sheet on his 
presidency 
the will of my people has caused me to navigate seas each day 
more stormy and more dangerous because of crosscurrents the 
absence of fair winds and persistent adversity all along the route 
have joined to prevent us from bringing about our high aims he 
said 
a highranking us diplomat who has been in el salvador for 
most of duartes term remarked he didnt work miracles so he 
has taken a lot of knocks some fair and some not he was not a 
great administrator he merged the party and the government and 
surrounded himself with some unscrupulous people but he must be 
credited with instituting the democratic system itself his great 
legacy is this transition the rest pales by comparison 
the diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity 
ignacio ellacuria a roman catholic priest who is rector of the 
prestigious central american university agreed that duarte 
fostered what the academian termed formal democratic liberties 
but he never realized what little real power he had hes not 
a false man but he is a man who is selfdeceived his hands were 
completely tied by the united states and the armed forces 
obviously he has governed amid much danger and difficulty 
the fmln was against him private enterprise was against him the 
media were against him arena was against him so he had to take 
refuge in the armed forces and the united states said ellacuria 
the fmln are the spanish initials for the rebel farabundo marti 
national liberation front 
ellacuria harshly criticized duarte for presiding over a junta 
in 198182 the years of most ferocious repression during which 
death squads and the military were blamed for abducting and 
murdering up to 700 suspected leftists each month 
duarte accepted thousands of murders with the facile argument 
that if he were not there on the junta there would be more 
that is a measure of this mans ambition for power

the army began issuing computerized plastic 
identity cards to palestinians in the occupied gaza strip on 
thursday to try to increase its control over the rebellious 
population 
in jerusalem tens of thousands of israelis gathered at the 
sacred western wall in the old city in a show of solidarity marking 
the 22nd anniversary of israels capture of arab east jerusalem 
israel tv quoted police as saying that about 40000 people many 
waving israeli flags came to the plaza facing the wall the last 
remnant of the ancient jewish temple and judaisms holiest site 
the identity card program in the gaza strip will force gazans to 
show the cards on leaving and reentering the territory via army 
checkpoints media reports said 
government officials have said they also expect the system to be 
used in the west bank 
the new gaza strip identity cards have imbedded magnetic strips 
a senior military official refused comment on media reports that 
the cards would be run through computer readers at army checkpoints 
women as well as children under 16 are exempt and can continue 
using their old identity cards the official said he said he 
expected between 70000 and 80000 gazans to apply for the new 
cards most of them because they work in israel 
last month the army ordered all 50000 gazans working in israel 
to return to their homes for a week and several municipal 
governments and some israeli factories launched campaigns to 
replace arab workers with jews 
the latest move coincided with a demand by prime minister 
yitzhak shamir that the army adopt harsher measures to end the 
nearly 18monthold palestinian uprising against israeli rule in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel captured the territories home to 17 million 
palestinians from egypt and jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
the rebellion has left 503 palestinians and 22 israelis dead 
a way must be found to liquidate the intefadeh shamir was 
quoted by the daily yediot ahronot as telling defense minister 
yitzhak rabin in a private meeting wednesday intefadeh is 
arabic for uprising 
shamir spokesman yossi ahimeir confirmed that shamir sought a 
tougher approach by the military but declined to give details he 
insisted israel would maintain a policy of inflicting the minimum 
possible bloodshed 
the jewish ceremony in the old city began with a prayer and 
then plaza lights were put out and a giant image of the star of 
david was projected on the walls ancient stones 
the government placed a special emphasis on the jerusalem day 
celebrations in an apparent attempt to confront arab demands that 
the status of jerusalem which israel has declared its capital be 
discussed in talks on the future of the occupied lands the 
palestine liberation organization has declared an independent state 
at the western wall shamir vowed that that the country of the 
murderers will not come into being 
no force in the world can separate us and jerusalem shamir 
declared at a rally earlier in the day 
also thursday jewish extremists waving israeli flags and 
singing hebrew songs marched for two hours through jerusalems arab 
sector under heavy police guard to mark jerusalem day 
police fired tear gas and chased an arab youth into his home 
after a bottle and two rocks were dropped from rooftops on a group 
of about 50 jewish marchers no one was injured 
ariel a jewish settlement in the west bank amended rules 
requiring palestinian employees to wear tags reading alien 
worker dorit shalit an administrative employee said all 
nonresidents would be required to wear tags including jews 
introduction of the tags for palestinians had inspired 
comparisons with the nazi order that every jew wear a yellow star 
of david 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher called 
the tags for palestinian workers offensive 
also thursday at least 18 palestinians mostly teenagers were 
wounded in clashes with troops in the west bank and gaza strip 
arab hospital officials said 
the army confirmed eight injuries including five people shot 
and wounded in the west bank city of nablus arab reports said the 
nablus injuries occurred when soldiers opened fire to break up a 
protest march by about 200 children 
in the west bank town of salfit israeli paratroopers detained 
about 30 suspected leaders of the uprising in a raid

a fifthgrader thinks children are ignored when 
it comes to national holidays so with the help of his 
congressman hes trying to institute national kids day 
most kids are good citizens said larry banister ii a 
10yearold from dahlonega in northern georgia i tell people 
kids are our most precious asset they honor mothers and fathers 
and old folks so why not kids too 
since he was in the third grade larry has been lobbying 
washington as well as city county and state governments across 
the country to institute a holiday honoring children 
he said his campaign began when he observed an old folks day 
at his school and he was inspired by a bit of envy 
larrys mother joyce banister put it this way you know how 
on mothers day you buy a little gift and think about the person 
well thats what kids want too 
the youngsters efforts havent gone unnoticed in all more 
than 25 local governments have passed resolutions observing a 
childrens day larry said including his home county lumpkin 
county 
last week larry received a letter informing him that juneau 
alaska would honor kids this friday mayor bruce botelho 
proclaimed june 2 as youth appreciation day in the alaskan capital 
noting that it was also the last day of the school year there 
though larrys letter to botelho didnt mention it the date 
also happens to be the boys birthday 
but georgia so far is the only state government to honor 
children gov joe frank harris instituted kids day last dec 8 
larry hopes that with the help of rep ed jenkins the nation 
will soon observe a kids day too 
rep joseph p kennedy iii dmass offered a resolution feb 
7 naming the second sunday in october 1989 as national childrens 
day a spokesman in kennedys office said the resolution offered 
at the behest of kennedys twin sons passed the house on a voice 
vote may 9 and went to the senate judiciary committee 
jenkins a democrat from jasper said when larry first 
approached him two years ago he decided to cosponsor the 
resolution that passed 
but it didnt fully suit larry jenkins said because the day 
was not permanently observed and was not a national holiday the 
congressman noted that a weekday holiday with time off for 
government workers would cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
we try to be careful in not proliferating holidays he said 
but i think little larry will be happy with a permanent 
resolution to observe the day or maybe a holiday on the weekend 
if he keeps pushing he may very well succeed in setting aside 
the same day to be observed every year jenkins said hes a 
bright young man and he already has me in his pocket 
jenkins said larry is a little upset with president bush 
because he has not answered letters on the subject larry who 
says he plans to run for president himself one day contends that 
if bush were interested there would be a kids day for sure 
finally i wrote him and asked if he had a gap in his gourd 
and that time a secretary wrote back to tell me the president cant 
respond to every letter said larry itd only take one minute 
to write me

president ranasinghe premadasa said 
thursday he will ask india to withdraw its troops next month two 
years after they arrived to disarm tamil guerrillas under an 
agreement to end the ethnic civil war 
i would like to see the last of the indian troops leave sri 
lanka by the end of july he told a buddhist gathering at a 
temple in battaramula seven miles southeast of colombo 
the first indian soldiers arrived july 30 1987 hours after 
premadasas predecessor junius r jayewardene and prime minister 
rajiv gandhi signed the peace accord 
its purpose was to end years of rebellion by tamils seeking an 
independent homeland the war began in 1982 and has claimed 9000 
lives 
india became involved because it is the major power in the 
region and has a tamil population of about 60 million 
the number of indian soldiers grew from the initial 3000 to 
70000 as confrontations increased with tamil militants who did not 
accept the peace agreement an estimated 45000 indian soldiers 
remain in northern and eastern sri lanka where most tamils live 
more than 700 indian soldiers have been killed 
indias action to call back the peacekeeping force during the 
next two months will be considered as a favor premadasa said 
i have no doubt that india will do so 
since assuming office five months ago premadasa has repeatedly 
said he wants indian soldiers to withdraw but had not set a 
timetable 
referring to a summit of seven south asian nations scheduled for 
colombo later this year premadasa said sri lanka cannot host such 
a meeting when a foreign army is operating in the country 
he said sri lanka was grateful for the sacrifices made by india 
but we will be also grateful if india agrees to withdraw its 
troops from the country 
from the outset of its involvement india has said it had no 
plans to remain in sri lanka indefinitely 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up about 18 percent of sri 
lankas 16 million people and claim discrimination by the 
predominantly buddhist sinhalese majority premadasa is sinhalese 
as was jayewardene 
the most powerful rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam backed out of the peace agreement and continued the 
guerrilla war premadasa opened negotiations with the tigers after 
offering them amnesty and seats in parliament 
sinhalese radicals oppose overtures to the tamils and embarked 
on their own campaign of violence soon after the peace accord was 
signed 
police said sinhalese militants killed six people thursday in 
three separate attacks among the victims were bennet perera chief 
of a special police unit investigating sinhalese radicals and his 
chauffeur

the chairman of the ohio republican party 
on thursday asked for the resignation of us rep donald lukens 
who was convicted last week of a misdemeanor charge of having sex 
with a 16yearold girl 
i think he is a bad apple for the republican party robert 
bennett said at a news conference i do not expect congressman 
lukens to be on the ticket anytime in 1990 
bennett said the fourterm republican congressman from 
middletown also should resign from the republican state committee 
which oversees the partys operations in ohio 
the call for lukens resignation was the obvious political 
move said lukens chief of staff william jarrell 
this is a move where the party distances itself from 
lukens they have their own pressures they have to react to 
jarrell said by telephone from washington 
but jarrell said lukens feels no bitterness whatsoever to mr 
bennett or the republican party 
lukens 58 was convicted may 26 of contributing to the 
delinquency and unruliness of a minor following a fiveday trial in 
franklin county domestic relations court a jury found lukens 
guilty of having sex with the girl at his columbus apartment last 
nov 6 when she was 16 
a misdemeanor conviction does not prohibit a congressman from 
remaining in office or seeking reelection 
bennett said he talked with lukens late wednesday and informed 
the congressmans office thursday of his plan to seek the 
resignation bennett said he also conferred with party leaders in 
lukens western ohio district 
lukens planned to make a statement friday on his political 
future said jarrell lukens who plans to appeal the conviction 
is confident he will win back party support jarrell said 
after we file and win the appeal theyre going to be right 
back in his corner said jarrell 
lukens served two terms in congress in the late 1960s and was 
reelected in 1986 
bennett said he will meet with the party leaders after lukens is 
sentenced sentencing is expected during the week of june 26 judge 
ronald solove has ordered a presentence investigation

a man who sparked a national debate when he 
disconnected his comatose sons lifesupport system at gunpoint was 
taken to a hospital thursday for a violent reaction to an illegal 
drug police said 
rudy linares a 23yearold house painter was discharged later 
in the day after a medical evaluation said mac neal memorial 
hospital spokeswoman diane laux 
officers were dispatched to the linares home early thursday 
after paramedics requested help said cicero deputy police 
superintendent steve zalas 
detective ronald mersch described linares as wild like an 
epileptic would be 
mr linares told one of the officers hed taken some bad 
pcp zalas said pcp is the hallucinogen phencyclidine known on 
the street as angel dust a drug with both stimulating and 
depressing effects 
zalas said linares told officers what would you do if your 
son just died 
he was kind of combative zalas said there was a 
confrontation and he had to be handcuffed before we could put him 
on a stretcher 
zalas said officers did not find any drugs in the apartment 
in april linares was charged with murder after he pulled a 
handgun in a hospital where his 15monthold son was being kept 
ordered staff from the room and then unhooked the lifesupport 
system 
he cradled his son samuel in his arms about 30 minutes until 
he was certain the boy was dead 
prosecutors decided they would not pursue the murder charge 
after a cook county grand jury refused to indict linares on may 19 
the boy had been in a coma considered irreversible by doctors 
since choking on a balloon nine months earlier the hospital 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center had refused family 
requests to withdraw life support saying the child was not brain 
dead 
linares and his wife have two other children 
neighbors said the latest incident caught them by surprise 
it might have been eating him up on the inside but he didnt 
show it on the outside said kevin camarena 
all his bereavement was built up inside because he was so 
composed said another neighbor bernice kield it was just 
bottled up and it exploded

president bush announced thursday he had approved 
funding for continued operations of two existing landsat satellites 
and for the completion and launch of a third satellite that takes 
closerange pictures of earth 
the announcement was made by the traveling white house while 
bush was at dinner with british prime minister margaret thatcher on 
the final evening of his fourcountry trip to europe 
the presidents action saves the satellites from extinction 
they had been turned over to private industry in 1985 but the 
company formed to sell the images was unable to make the venture 
pay even with government help 
spot a french satellite is capable of taking even better 
images than landsat and has captured much of the market for remote 
sensing 
the commerce department announced earlier this year that it had 
no funds to continue operating the satellite and planned to shut it 
down vice president dan quayle head of the national space 
council stepped in and urged the president to find money to give 
the satellites a new lease on life 
the white house announcement said continued operation of 
landsats 4 and 5 will require an additional 5 million this fiscal 
year and 19 million next year cost of completion and launch of 
landsat 6 by 1991 has already been included in the commerce 
department budget 
over recent years it has become increasingly evident that 
commercializing the entire landsat program would not be feasible 
until at least the end of the century the statement said 
landsat images have been used since 1972 to evaluate earth 
resources and soil moisture and search for oil and other minerals

one of four attackers police chief lee sullivan said 
gregory shane hardin 18 of boaz ala was arrested on a 
sexual battery charge sullivan said hardin was in jail thursday 
under 50000 bond on the felony which is floridas equivalent of 
a rape charge 
the chief called the attack the most pitiful sexual crime he has 
seen during his years of law enforcement 
it should never have happened he said its not going to 
happen again we made some patrol procedure changes and moved some 
of our resources to the beach 
sullivan said rape is rare in the community but a gang rape in 
front of witnesses is a sad commentary on us all 
hardin and possibly one other man allegedly raped the teenager 
while two others helped hold her down sullivan said the victim 
was bruised on her ankles wrists breasts and genitals 
the lab is going to be able to tell us how many assaults we 
had he said

celebrate her high school graduation while her friend left for 
something to eat she joined an impromptu party near the beachfront 
holiday inn where she met hardin and another man said police lt

a blast of 2440 tons of 
ammonium nitrate and fuel oil rocked the white sands missile range 
thursday in a simulation of the effects of a nuclear explosion 
the test called misers gold was the fifth in a series of 
nonnuclear explosions set off since 1976 by the defense nuclear 
agency it is intended to show what happens to military and 
civilian equipment during and after a large explosion 
the blast was the equivalent of a 4kiloton nuclear device by 
comparison the atomic bomb that devastated hiroshima japan in 
august 1945 had a force of 13 kilotons 
misers gold includes 180 experiments by the united states and 
five foreign countries intended to test the effects of air blast 
and ground shock on such things as bunkers underground shelters 
and radar 
navy cmdr jr lund of the agencys test directorate called the 
test an unqualified success 
however he said it will take several months to evaluate what 
was learned from all the experiments set up on the 120acre test 
bed 
canada switzerland norway sweden and the united kingdom 
mostly tested civilian equipment while the united states 
concentrated on military systems lund said 
the foreign countries are really into testing civil defense 
shelters he said 
i think they feel they are more at risk he added 
about 125 people gathered in the southern new mexico desert to 
witness the blast which was delayed 30 minutes before being 
detonated at 930 am 
at t minus one minute onlookers who sat six miles north of 
ground zero readied themselves and most inserted earplugs to deaden 
the anticipated blast 
a huge cloud of brown smoke formed a distorted mushroom against 
the background of the blue sky and mountains about 25 seconds 
later the shock wave could be felt by the spectators on the 
bleachers while at the same moment a loud muffled boom rocked the 
area 
the boom was followed by cheers from the crowd 
this is fun to look at but the real work begins now said 
lt col al schenker of the defense nuclear agency 
seven missiles were launched within one minute of the detonation 
and flew through the brown cloud the missiles will be tested for 
erosion 
schenker said the test bed including bunkers rooms and other 
structures cost 265 million and took 14 months to build

house speaker jim wrights chief accuser 
charged thursday that wrights condemnation of ethics 
investigations as mindless cannibalism in his resignation 
speech was an insult to the ethics committee and every decent 
person in the house 
rep newt gingrich the georgia republican who was elected gop 
whip in large part because of his attacks on wright said he 
initially refused to comment after wrights resignation speech 
wednesday because i was so angry at the tone of the speech and 
some of the things he said 
i thought the whole thing was designed to blame the 
institution and to blame the press gingrich said of wrights 
speech 
gingrich said there is no feeding frenzy on ethics in the 
house as wright alleged instead he said there is only an effort 
to ensure that house standards are upheld 
why is it wrong to insist that the current rules be enforced 
against gross violations he said not against nitpicking or 
clerical error 
he said wright and majority whip tony coelho dcalif who 
announced friday he was resigning rather than face an ethics probe 
of his personal finances are the first two guys i know of to 
have resigned from high office for corruption in modern times 
house democrats filed an ethics complaint against gingrich in 
april alleging that he violated house rules when a group of 
wealthy political supporters formed a partnership in 1984 to 
promote his book window of opportunity 
that complaint is still pending before the committee and 
gingrich acknowledged thursday that he might be the next target of 
a house ethics investigation 
im counting on the same ethics committee he said i 
trust their judgment to be honest theyll have a good measurement 
they can take my book case and they can compare it to jim 
wrights book case 
theyre totally different where jim wright was the example 
of how to do it wrong i think were the example of how to do it 
right he said 
part of the ethics committees case against wright involved 
allegations that he used bulk sales of his book reflections of a 
public man to evade the house limit on outside income 
gingrich said he does not believe the investigation of wright 
and the allegations of ethical wrongdoing by other members has 
distracted the house from its real business 
if you have a speaker with enough violations that he has to 
resign i think thats important he said isnt having an 
honest house part of the real business of the house 
asked if republicans are planning to take advantage of 
democratic ethics problems for political ends gingrich said both 
parties should be aggressive in looking for instances of bad 
behavior and police each other

robert fulton opposed by a group of senate 
conservatives and righttolife advocates dropped out of 
consideration thursday for a top welfare post in the bush 
administration 
health and human services secretary louis w sullivan who had 
wanted fulton to head the family services administration which 
manages the governments major welfare programs said he accepted 
fultons decision with profound regret 
i have requested my name be withdrawn but of course i dont 
do that with any joy fulton oklahomas social services 
secretary told the associated press 
in a statement issued by his office sullivan said fulton would 
have done an outstanding job as an assistant secretary in the 
federal department 
sullivan said he would continue to review other candidates for 
the position and would make a recommendation to president bush as 
quickly as possible 
fulton was opposed by some righttolife groups who criticized 
his action when as director of the oklahoma human services 
department he became aware of a state hospital policy of 
withholding lifesaving care from babies with the crippling 
deformity spina bifida 
trying to fend off the criticism fulton had said that after 
learning of the policy he put into effect regulations requiring 
medical treatment for all infants unless it would be futile or 
would shorten the babys life 
but critics said protections he instituted were required by 
federal law and they said doctors involved were never sanctioned 
he took only the most superficial investigation did not speak 
to any of the doctors and did not hold anyone accountable said 
sen gordon humphrey rnh who last month sent bush a letter 
signed by five other conservative senators opposing fulton 
i am relieved that the nomination will not be made said 
humphrey 
he demonstrated an insensitivity to the right to life of 
handicapped infants said douglas johnson legislative director 
for the national righttolife committee 
we felt it was inappropriate to put someone like that in a 
senior policy position of a prolife administration added 
johnson in a telephone interview 
the most disturbing thing about it is the influence of the 
special interest groups on the administration fulton said 
concerning his withdrawal

president bush sought to ease strains with prime 
minister margaret thatcher on thursday and maintain a special 
relationship with her conservative government as he wrapped up his 
fournation european tour 
while bush mended fences after a tough session with mrs 
thatcher secretary of state james a baker iii challenged the 
soviet union to resond to the latest us proposal for cutting 
american and soviet troops in europe to 275000 on each side 
brushing aside a cool reaction from foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze as only preliminary baker said the ball is in their 
court and a response by them is now clearly called for 
he said western experts will meet for three months at nato 
headquarters in brussels to flesh out bushs armsreduction 
initiatives which include the projected troop cuts so they can be 
formally presented by the western alliance to the warsaw pact in 
vienna on sept 7 
bush who will fly home on friday lunched with queen elizabeth 
ii on duck with honey and brandy sauce in the chandeliered second 
floor music room of buckingham palace after meeting with mrs 
thatcher 
its only with friends that you can take off the gloves and 
talk from the heart bush told reporters at the conclusion of his 
session with the prime minister at heavily guarded 10 downing 
street and i felt that i was with a friend today 
as the day wore on the two leaders put the emphasis on the 
centuries old ties that bind their nations 
at a gala dinner at 10 downing street where both thatcher and 
bush regaled the guests with jokes and anecdotes each spoke 
seriously of what the angloamerican relationship means 
you always will be able to count on britain when there is 
danger when you need us thats why the relationship is so 
special thatcher told bush 
he called mrs thatcher a seasoned leader and said americans 
look to the prime minister with great admiration for all you have 
done for britain and all you have done for the alliance 
he said that with natos new arms control initiative we seek 
to free western europe from the shadow of soviet military power 
the special relationship forged under former president reagan 
was tested a bit at the nato summit meeting this week in brussels 
over how the western allies should respond to arms control 
initiatives by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
led by bush the 16 allied leaders forged a compromise that 
blended mrs thatchers hardline views with the more dovish 
position of west german chancellor helmut kohl 
that problem resolved baker acknowledged at a news conference a 
continuing usbritish disagremement over south asian boat 
people 
about 750 are arriving daily in hong kong and the thatcher 
government would like to stem the flow and send some back to 
vietnam and cambodia 
baker said however it is still the position of the united 
states that we support the right of political asylum and freedom of 
choice for political refugees 
there are strains also over continued us military aid to 
argentina britains adversary in the 1982 falkland islands war 
with the return to power in buenos aires of the nationalistic 
peronists britain is even more touchy about argentinas claim to 
own the britishcontrolled islands off the south american coast 
bush and thatcher stressed agreements rather than differences in 
remarks after the meeting with the prime minister praising bushs 
leadership at the very very successful nato summit meeting 
she said the president is staunch and steadfast on everything 
which is of fundamental value to democracy freedom and justice 
and necessary to keep our country secure 
asked if britain remains americas most important ally mrs 
thatcher replied i think you might put it more tactfully 
america has allies throughout europe and throughout the free world 
i would like to think that we pride ourselves on being among 
the foremost of united states friends and we will always be 
i think it is quite wrong that because you have one friend 
you should exclude the possibility of other friendships as well 
bush asked about the special relationship said he expects it 
to stay on a steady keel 
however in a toast to mrs thatcher at dinner at 10 downing 
street he said every time he meets her he is reminded of the late 
prime minister benjamin disraelis observation that there is no 
wisdom like frankness 
in diplomatic jargon frankness signifies disagreement 
the 64 guests at the downing street dinner were an eclectic mix 
of cabinet ministers aristocrats trade unionists former prime 
minister alec douglashome now lord home and neil kinnock leader 
of the opposition labor party 
other british celebrities on the guest list were comedian john 
cleese star of the movie a fish called wanda andrew lloyd 
webber composer of such hit musicals as cats and phantom of 
the opera us masters golf champion nick faldo former 
wimbledon tennis champion virginia wade and television host david 
frost

of the city nor suburbanites who tried to get to their jobs in the 
midst of a subway strike 
already clogged streets were blocked for the bush motorcade as 
it sped from event to event guided by motorcyle police who cleared

a couple who claimed their infant son 
was the victim of product tampering have been charged with murder 
accused of forcing the child to drink baby formula laced with acid 
prosecutors said thursday 
its a case thats been on my mind for five years said 
matthew chancey assistant lake county states attorney 
shelia smith 26 and ricky irby sr 29 were each charged in a 
grand jury indictment with a single count of murder and put in jail 
in lieu of 1 million bonds ordered thursday by lake county 
associate judge harry hartel 
on may 31 1984 the parents were charged with abuse in a 
juvenile petition after bringing their 3monthold son quinten 
irby to a hospital and claiming he had been poisoned by drinking 
baby formula chancey said 
tests on the boys stomach found high concentrations of a 
substance believed to be pure sulfuric acid but much of the 
evidence gathered during the original investigation cans of 
formula a baby bottle and a nipple was lost at the illinois 
department of public health laboratory where it was sent for 
analysis 
chancey said prosecutors decided not to pursue the case after 
the loss of the evidence 
quintin meanwhile lingered near death for more than two years 
with severe burn scars on his mouth and trachea he also had one 
lung removed and was kept on a ventilator until his august 1986 
death at childrens memorial hospital in chicago 
he was unable to swallow to breathe or to speak chancey 
recalled 
the nature of the crime the setback after we lost much of 
the evidence the frustration for a long time that we wouldnt be 
able to indict anyone i carried all those things around for a long 
time he said 
a break for prosecutors came in november when the us supreme 
court in an arizona case ruled that evidence lost accidentally 
does not prevent prosecution 
immediately after that this case popped into my mind 
chancey said i started thinking maybe we can do this 
chancey said that prior to a trial of the case he would not 
discuss whether he believes money was the motive for the poisoning 
irby filed a lawsuit in august 1987 charging negligence against 
the baby formula maker abbott laboratories of north chicago and 
the grocery store where he said the formula was bought 
the lawsuit claimed the similac with iron formula the couple 
gave to quinten contained a foreign and dangerous acidic andor 
lye substance and was unfit for human consumption 
irby withdrew the lawsuit a year ago 
were not sure why that was abbott spokeswoman cathy 
babington said thursday as i recall there were never any 
pleadings in the case when it was withdrawn 
a county grand jury heard evidence for four weeks before 
returning the indictment wednesday 
chancey said the parents have an 8yearold son ricky jr he 
said both are unemployed although irby has worked at area 
automobile plants 
neither ms smith nor irby was represented by an attorney 
though irby has retained one and ms smith told hartel she would 
have one by wednesdays scheduled arraignment

rep richard gephardt appealed to democratic 
colleagues thursday to elect him majority leader as part of a new 
generation to take control of the house 
john kennedy said in 1961 that it was time for a new 
generation of americans to lead our country now i believe it is 
time for a new generation of members to lead the congress 
gephardt 48 said in a letter to house democrats 
the missouri congressman noted that like himself twothirds of 
current house members have been elected since 1978 and he 
described the democrats as a young and vibrant majority 
the seventerm lawmaker is campaigning for the no 2 house 
leadership spot to replace rep tom foley who is expected to 
become speaker next week now that speaker jim wright has announced 
his resignation 
gephardt who ran for president in 1988 is considered the 
frontrunner in the leadership race although he is opposed by rep 
ed jenkins dga 
in an interview gephardt said he was encouraged by support 
he had already received from democrats but would not predict 
victory 
the feedback has been positive but im surely not prepared to 
say that weve done it said gephardt 
he made clear that his candidacy in contrast to jenkins was 
based on the generational appeal to democrats as well his 
experiences as a televisionage presidential candidate and in 
previous leadership posts in the house including four years as 
party caucus chairman 
i think i learned how to put together coalitions in the house 
so we can reach consensus in the congress and be able to assert a 
policy said gephardt i also have learned something about 
conveying an issue to voters in the country at large 
the missourian confirmed in the letter that he would not seek 
the 1992 presidential nomination if he becomes majority leader but 
would devote all of my energies to the work of the house he 
said he had been seriously considering another run for the 
white house and said it was a difficult decision to seek the house 
post 
some democrats were annoyed at gephardts prolonged absence from 
the house during last years presidential campaign when he was 
head of the party caucus the no 4 leadership job he no longer 
holds that post 
i am not going to use a house leadership position as a 
stepping stone to something else gephardt said i havent said 
this about 92 because i thought it was necessary to get elected 
but because i believe that you cant do two things at once of this 
magnitude 
in his letter gephardt echoed wrights call for an end to 
partisan bloodletting over ethics and said lawmakers must get 
back to the peoples business 
there are too many urgent needs facing our nation for us to 
engage in retribution and unnecessary partisanship gephardt 
wrote 
it will be my goal working with tom foley and with each of 
you to help shape and implement a legislative agenda that 
addresses the nations most serious concerns 
he cited health care housing education and economic 
security as pressing topics before congress 
gephardt said he was not interested in wallowing in rumor or 
engaging in partisan intrigue 
his supporters view his as squeaky clean certified by a 
presidential campaign as free of any potential ethical problems to 
cause the party further embarrassment 
gephardt jumped into the leadership race on saturday after rep 
tony coelho dcalif the majority whip announced his resignation 
from the house in order to avoid a lengthy investigation into his 
own personal finances

more than 1000 helmeted soldiers jogged near a 
city train station friday in the third straight day of 
muscleflexing aimed at unnerving prodemocracy protesters holed up 
in tiananmen square 
the peoples liberation army troops came out of the station ran 
through the surrounding neighborhood and returned to their camp in 
the station but they did not approach tiananmen square just over a 
mile away 
the square the symbolic heart of china has been occupied by up 
to 200000 students since they launched their protests more than 
six weeks ago about 10000 students are massed there now in 
defiance of martial law orders to leave 
the students who have gained considerable support from ordinary 
citizens are demanding more democracy an end to corruption among 
officials and a dialogue with the government 
instead the government has engaged them in a war of nerves and 
this weeks shows of force indicated that officials are poised to 
enforce martial law and put down the protest movement 
on thursday about 300 army troops marched within a block of 
tiananmen square on thursday national television showed hundreds 
of soldiers faststepping out of the city railroad station 
the previous day a large procession of military motorcycles 
roared through the capital 
beijing citizens in a show of support for the students blocked 
troops from entering the city after the government declared martial 
law on may 20 
but residents for the moment are subdued as the government wages 
a propaganda campaign warns that participants in prodemocracy 
rallies face pay cuts and other punishment 
a city spokesman issued a stern warning thursday to foreign 
journalists saying they were banned from covering student protests 
and that all media coverage in the capital must receive prior 
approval by city officials 
ding weijun also said foreign journalists are not allowed to 
invite chinese citizens to their offices residences or hotels 
for interviews on activities prohibited under martial law 
the foreign correspondents club of china said the regulations 
were a deplorable case of press censorship and harassment and 
urged the beijing government to rescind the restrictions 
dings sevenpoint statement read at a weekly foreign ministry 
briefing expanded on martial law regulations banning foreign press 
coverage of the student protests the restrictions include a ban on 
photographing or videotaping military troops 
beijingbased foreign journalists and hundreds more who have 
come to cover the protests had faced few problems until this week 
when police warned at least two us television networks and a 
japanese network that their crews were violating martial law 
regulations 
police also summoned a correspondent for the japanese daily 
yomiuri shimbun for a warning and on thursday the british 
broadcasting corp was called in 
late thursday night a few hundred students protested in front 
of police headquarters claiming that officers had beaten a 
japanese reporter and two students 
the confrontation between the students and authorities took a 
strange twist on thursday when hundreds of students disrupted a 
progovernment rally in a village north of beijing 
thousands of farmers and workers many ordered by local 
officials or employers to attend the rally were silenced when 
their slogans of support for premier li pengs hardline policies 
were drowned out by the students shouts for lis resignation 
in another propaganda faceoff the students entertained 
thousands of children on tiananmen square to offset government 
charges they had disrupted childrens day celebrations planned for 
the plaza which the students took over on may 13 
children brought popsicles stuffed animals and money for the 
students who signed autographs with such messages as when you 
go to college may you never have to endure the hardship of a 
hunger strike 
also on thursday student activists announced the creation of a 
nationwide student group intended to end a rift between beijing 
students and others from outside the city 
the students have grown increasingly divided over whether to 
remain on the square and how to keep their faltering movement alive 
some student leaders claimed that four members of the 
nonbeijing faction entered the tent of beijing activist chai ling 
early thursday and tried to gag and kidnap her they said the 
antibeijing faction cut loudspeaker wires when chai later tried to 
tell others on the square about the incident

two members of the ruling communist party 
politburo made clear thursday they reject populist boris n 
yeltsins demand to relinquish supreme power 
vadim a medvedev chief party ideologist and moscow communist 
party boss lev n zaikov told reporters the party has the right to 
choose the head of state and government 
as in any civilized state the leader of the party becomes the 
head of state thats fully natural medvedev said 
the officials spoke after members of the congress of peoples 
deputies openly questioned whether president mikhail s gorbachev 
should serve in the dual role of head of party and state and after 
yelstins sharp criticism of the party on wednesday 
yeltsin who was replaced by zaikov as moscow party chief 
called for an immediate transfer of power from the communist party 
to the congress 
the congress must take power into its own hands yeltsin 
said wednesday he charged that gorbachevs policy of perestroika 
or restructuring had failed and that people were living worse four 
years after it was implemented 
the party is identified in the soviet constitution as the 
leading force in soviet society and no other parties are legal 
about 80 percent of the 2250 members of the congress are 
communist party membersbut the congress slogans declare that 
power rests with the soviets or local governing councils and 
yeltsins demand recalled that stillpowerful appeal from the first 
days of the bolshevik revolution 
neither politburo official criticized yeltsin directly 
medvedev said he was an ardent supporter of a sharper line 
between party and government functions with the party taking the 
work of shaping policy ideology organization and political work 
and the government being responsible for legislation and executive 
functions 
asked which job was more important communist party chief or 
president he responded that the jobs simply had different 
responsibilities 
zaikov said opposes removing the communist partys special 
status in the soviet constitution but held open the possibility 
that competition might some day be allowed 
asked about the possibility of a multiparty system he 
responded who thought our socialist revolution would take place 
who thought that perestroika would start who can say when it will 
be if it will be maybe 
but he added that now was not the time the communist party is 
at its most difficult critical stage and it would be unfair to 
allow another party to spring up and practice pure politics he 
said 
the party must concentrate on consolidating the strengths of 
soviet society rather than allowing it to break down in partisan 
politics zaikov said 
yeltsin has been accused by party official of speaking out in 
favor of a multiparty system a commission of the partys 
policymaking central committee is investigating the accusation 
yeltsin denies it but says that the issue must be discussed 
rather than repressed as it has been for decades

the housing and urban development department 
said thursday it will resume subsidies under new rules for the 
rehabilitation of privately owned housing used by lowincome and 
moderateincome families 
secretary jack kemp had suspended the program in april 
canceling awards made this fiscal year after the departments 
inspector general reported it had been mismanaged and riddled with 
favoritism for former highranking republicans serving as 
consultants to developers 
the departments announcement said new awards will be based on 
numerical rankings in a competitive process for available funds 
i am fully committed to admistering a reformed moderate 
rehabilitation program in a fair open competitive manner with 
no special favors no insders access and no secret deals kemp 
said in a statement 
the ranking formula will consider area poverty crowding and 
quality of housing for the poor will eliminate reserve funds 
allocated according to the discretion of headquarters and will 
limit awards to projects of fewer than 100 units to discourage 
participation by big developers 
the department said it could have 250 million available for the 
remainder of the fiscal year depending upon congressional action

a federal court on thursday denied 
a request by city officials to stop the reconstruction of a 
gasoline pipeline through a neighborhood that was virtually 
destroyed when it exploded last week 
the us ninth circuit court of appeals in san francisco citing 
lack of jurisdiction refused to grant a temporary restraining 
order said city attorney james penman a state judge made the same 
declaration earlier this week 
calnev pipe line co wants to replace the line along the same 
course it occupied when it exploded in flames may 25 killing two 
residents and injuring 31 the same area was struck two weeks 
earlier with a fatal runaway train wreck 
city officials want to have the pipeline relocated on the other 
side of train track and away from the devastated residential 
neighborhood a 35foot high levee separates the track and the 
neighborhood said penman the wall of dirt would provide some 
protection in the event of a similar accident he said 
the petition sought a stay of federal pipeline safety director 
richard beams order for reinstallation pending a federal court 
review 
while city officials try to find a way to halt the line and 
divert it to another area workers for calnev continued to lay the 
reinforced pipeline course said penman 
either the pipeline company is going to agree to move the pipe 
west of the railroad tracks penman said or we are going to 
keep going to courts until we find one that can exercise 
jurisdiction until there are no courts left to go to 
calnev officials said the replacement line could be in place and 
ready to restart sometime next week barring additional legal 
action by the city or further changes from the us transportation 
departments office of pipeline safety 
officials from the company say they will use several new safety 
features such as burying the pipe at twice its former depth and 
covering it with concrete and using a thicker seamless 
plasticcoated pipe welds between pipe sections also will be 
xrayed 
department of transportation officials on tuesday announced 
additional requirements for calnev to follow as they bury the pipe 
including replacement of an additional 1000 feet and the addition 
of a safety valve 
calnev operations manager dave andries said rerouting the line 
may actually be cheaper than the precautions calnev plans for using 
the same course but the company is concerned with possible flood 
damage on the other side of the levee 
on may 12 a runaway southern pacific train derailment in the 
same neighborhood on san bernardinos northwest side killed four 
people and injured 11 
authorities believe either the train wreck or salvage equipment 
brought in to clean it up damaged the 14inch pipeline which was 
delivering unleaded gasoline to las vegas from storage tanks in 
colton the combined accidents destroyed 22 homes 
city officials expected to be back in court friday either with 
a new petition for the federal court or an action for us district 
court in los angeles penman said the city also was trying to 
negotiate with calnev out of court penman said

a qantas airways jumbo jet with 325 
people aboard inexplicably pitched upward at 30000 feet thursday 
and then nosedived catapulting passengers around the cabin so 
hard they left dents and injuring up to 30 people 
a qantas official on friday described the effect as like a 
roller coaster ride for the 305 passengers and 20 crew members 
bound for singapore the plane a 747200 left from sydney and was 
diverted to darwin far northern australia 
fleet manager capt les hayward said he did not know whether air 
turbulence or a fault in the autopilot could have caused the 
malfunction 
he said 61 people were taken to royal darwin hospital but more 
than half of them were relatives of the injured 
passenger judy maher 22 of melbourne told australian 
associated press there was this drop and i saw people plates 
everything go flying we hit the ceiling and when we hit the floor 
again i was overcome with nausea there was blood spattered 
everywhere 
stewards were yelling for everyone to be calm but no one 
screamed and there didnt appear to be any panic 
hayward said the aircraft was flying at a cruising speed of 
about 520 mph southeast of derby western australia when it 
suddenly pitched and reared up 1500 feet before nosing over 
the captain disconnected the autopilot and rolled the aircraft 
back to a normal altitude as gently as he could hayward said 
as the aircraft pitched up the passengers would have been 
forced more firmly into their seats as the aircraft rolled over the 
top and pitched down again some of them did float out of their 
seats 
a doctor on board treated passengers for bruises and minor 
injuries 
hayward said the ceiling was dented where people bounced against 
the fuselage interior 
he said there was cosmetic damage to the rear of the plane 
which later took off for singapore bahrein and amsterdam hayward 
said the airline was investigating the cause of the mishap 
it would have been a bit like a roller coaster ride he said 
qantas said six passengers were detained overnight they were 
listed in stable condition friday and most were expected to be 
discharged during the day a cabin attendant was among the injured 
a former air force fighter navigator aboard the qf5 flight said 
he thought the aircraft was going to disintegrate as the pilot 
fought for control 
when he opened up the engines the vibration was incredible i 
thought the wings were going to drop off said 59yearold peter 
jensen who had set out from sydney with his wife brigitta on a 
roundtheworld trip 
the pilot capt lyn williams was not available for media 
interviews 
australian associated press said at least one dozen passengers 
wore medical neck supports it said the shirt of one man whose 
head was bandaged was caked with blood 
it felt like we hit an air pocket jensen said the plane 
dived away and i went straight up to the ceiling with a lot of 
others i couldnt be sure we were going to float out of the nose 
dip but we went straight back down to the seats 
jensen said he saw one man smash into an overhead locker 
breaking it off its hinges 
a 22yearold sydney man who received slight neck injuries said 
the plane appeared to jerk forward in a catapult action 
it was like being on a trampoline said the man who spoke 
on the condition of not being indentified then i can only 
remember the plane engines roaring out and a lot of vibration 
dutch student eric grooters 24 of amsterdam said he had his 
seat belt on as he watched his 21 yearold girlfriend monique 
lookman thrown to the planes roof 
it seemed like everyone was flying around inside the plane 
grooters said first the plane seemed to shake and everyone was 
terrified 
there were people stretching out in front of me without their 
seat belts

in the next to last scene of florida 
crackers somebody mentions that a red tide is coming in and soon 
therell be dead fish on the beach 
why dont they just swim away asks a character named lori 
they dont know any better answers a character named dean 
its playwright william s leavengoods metaphor for the 
increasingly dangerous drug scene in which his characters swim 
in his play which opened thursday at offbroadways circle 
repertory company leavengood has made his grungy people likable 
worth saving and interesting without the audience having to 
identify with them and though drugs permeate florida 
crackers leavengood does not glorify them 
the set by john lee beatty is the cheaply made florida 
oceanfront house of 30yearold joe played by john c mcginley 
mcginley gives the plays strongest performance as the father 
figure to his two brothers in their 20s thrown out of a family 
split by divorce joe peddles dope and sometimes drives delivery 
trucks of dope for dean mcginley conveys the impression that joe 
has an inner core of integrity he calls all the men son and 
when mcginley says it it sounds natural and caring 
michael piontek plays grant the second brother whose luck 
always is bad scott rymer plays russell the youngest brother 
just out of college who had the brains to become a doctor studied 
philosophy instead and now does nothing a warm moment in a play 
marked with sadly wasted potential and premonitions of violence has 
the three brothers singing the eagles take it to the limit 
brian jensen plays strings a wouldbe guitarist living in joes 
house stoned all the time joel anderson plays dean who sees 
mafia and other sharks moving in on his drugrunning business and 
believes theyre out to kill him 
for lighter moments of a feminine kind theres the upscale lori 
kim flowers and the loose funny tracey cyndi coyne playwright 
john bishop directed floridanative leavengoods offbroadway debut 
theres no happy ending when joe finally could swim away the 
pull of the family he has created with his brothers is stronger and 
he does something terrible and stays their leader in the deadly 
tides of dope

senate party leaders united thursday to fight 
off a wave of white houseopposed drug spending proposals as 
lawmakers debated a bill providing 33 billion for veterans and 
other domestic programs 
the measure for the waning months of the current fiscal year 
includes 12 billion for health care and other programs for 
veterans that are running low on funds it also carries 892 
million for the guaranteed student loan program for college 
students 423 million for state foster care programs and other 
funds for agencies needing money for the final four months of the 
1989 fiscal year 
lawmakers went home thursday evening after nearly 14 hours of 
debate and planned to resume work friday they adopted amendments 
ranging from providing 1 million for development of medicines for 
rare diseases to urging the bankruptcy court handling eastern 
airlines bankruptcy proceedings to consider appointing an 
independent trustee to replace chief executive frank lorenzo in 
running the strikebound carrier 
but the most controversial aspect of the senate bill is its 
omission of any additional antidrug money unlike a 37 billion 
version passed by the house on may 24 that contained 822 million 
for more prison cells extra drug agents improved education 
programs and other antidrug efforts 
that antidrug spending was shaved from the legislation by 
senate leaders before it reached the floor following bush 
administration threats to veto the entire bill over the antidrug 
money the white house says the extra spending would inflate this 
years already swollen federal deficit and can wait until 1990 and 
senior democratic and republican senators argued that adding drug 
monies would be futile 
this bill is for programs that are broke said senate 
appropriations chairman robert byrd dwva 
however that did not stop some senators from trying to increase 
spending against illicit drug dealers 
the senate voted 7120 to defeat an amendment by sen joseph 
biden ddel that would have spent another 18 billion this year 
for prevention and treatment programs grants to local governments 
more federal agents and other antidrug measures the provision 
would have raised the money by boosting federal taxes on cigarettes 
and alcoholic beverages 
sen arlen specter rpa pressed an amendment diverting 70 
million from defense department antidrug efforts to increasing 
federal prison space for drug offenders 
specter said the money would be a little something to show the 
american people that congress does more than pontificate and talk 
about the problem he was defeated 7718 
a proposal by sen alfonse damato rny to boost this years 
drug programs by 227 million was defeated 8115 
although the measure exceeds the 22 billion supplemental 
spending bill president bush sent congress in march the 
administration indicated in a statement thursday that it would 
support the senate proposal in view of the need for prompt action 
on veterans funding 
the legislation includes 342 million for the expenses of 
battling last years forest fires 225 million for the food stamps 
program 125 million for united nations peacekeeping forces 100 
million to help soviet and other refugees to this country and 91 
million for workers whose jobs were lost due to overseas 
competition 
it also contains 73 million for cleaning up the alaska oil 
spill 
as so often happens with spending bills the legislation has 
also picked up less farreaching provisions that reflect the 
interests of members of the appropriations committee 
thus it also provides 75 million to rebuild a radio telescope 
that toppled in west virginia home state of appropriations panel 
chairman robert byrd and it urges the department of health and 
human services to hire more health care workers in honolulu thanks 
to the efforts of sen daniel inouye dhawaii a ranking member of 
the committee 
it also contains 16 million for a philadelphia foundation to 
train unemployed people 18 million for a white house conference 
on library and information services 15 million for puerto ricos 
political parties to conduct a referendum on the islands political 
status and 66 million for subsidies for air carriers that serve 
small communities 
a nonbinding provision was also included expressing the 
senates desire to prevent panamanian ruler gen manuel antonio 
noriega from nominating a new administrator to the panama canal 
commission a treaty allows panama to nominate an administrator for 
the us agency which oversees the canal 
the language was introduced by sen dan coats rind and other 
conservative republicans and was approved on a voice vote

the national police said thursday that 
three highranking officers were arrested and 10 officers were 
fired on charges of working for colombias powerful drug 
trafficking cartels 
the forces commander gen miguel gomez padilla said in a 
communique his office will be inflexible in applying whatever 
corrective measures are needed to maintain discipline order and to 
guarantee good service to society 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo said on thursday that five 
officers have been arrested and 23 expelled from the force in 
recent months on corruption charges including a captain in the 
provincial capital of sincelejo caught with a suitcase full of drug 
money 
gomez padilla said drug dealers were trying with unusual 
persistence to destabilize the nations institutions 
a car bomb blew up on a main bogota boulevard tuesday as the 
head of colombias national bureau of investigation was passing he 
escaped death but four bystanders were killed he blamed the 
attack on drug traffickers working in conjunction with murderous 
rightwing vigilantes 
it was the latest in a series of assassinations or attempts 
against highranking justice and police officials in colombia a 
land plagued by cocaine trafficking rightist death squads and 
leftist guerrilla groups 
president virgilio barco said in an address to cadets at the 
military academy on thursday that such attacks only stiffen 
government resolve 
instead of weakening the fighting will of the country of our 
armed forces and of our security agencies it generates redoubled 
enthusiasm to move ahead he said

scott isaacs an eighthgrader from littleton 
colo won the 62nd annual national spelling bee on thursday by 
correctly spelling the word spoliator 
it was the 14yearolds third time in the national finals he 
defeated ojas v tejani of hixson tenn in a duel that capped the 
twoday finals 
they were the survivors of the largest field in the bees 
history outlasting 220 other contestants 
the word spoliator means a spoiler 
in the final rounds ojas a 12yearold sixthgrader correctly 
spelled saponaceous an adjective for something resembling 
soap and scott countered with the correct spelling of 
ideaphoria which is a capacity for creative thought or 
imagination 
both spellers however missed pasigraphy which means an 
artificial international written language and ojas then missed the 
next word senescing which means growing old 
scott spelled the word correctly and under contest rules had to 
spell the next word correctly he did and won the 1500 first 
prize 
ojas will collect 1000 
in third place was arthur a hodge 14 from pottsville pa 
who missed trinklied a word meaning a drinking song in fourth 
was samantha cassell of johnson city tenn who lost out on the 
word pedicled which means having a slender stalk 
scott was one of seven students competing in the national finals 
for the third time 
he is an eighthgrade pupil at kent denver country day school in 
englewood colo his father bud is an oil engineer and his 
mother kaye is a homemaker 
he was the 1987 and 1988 denver spelling champion 
ojas is in the sixth grade at st nicholas school in 
chattanooga the son of a chemical engineer vinay and a 
homemaker indu 
scott was to fly to new york later in the day to appear on 
fridays abc good morning america and he is booked for next 
week on nbcs tonight show starring johnny carson 
also scott and the entire indiana delegation of spellers have 
been invited to meet on friday with vice president quayle 
after six rounds only six boys and nine girls remained the 
next round cut that number to four and four and only the final 
four were left for the ninth round 
in quick succession arthur spelled wight a living being 
samantha spelled dihara a buddhist monastery ojas had 
halieutics which relates to fishing and scott was correct 
with morion a helmet worn by 16th and 17th century spanish 
footsoldiers 
in the 10th round arthur was correct with vigentennial 
which means once every 20 years and ojas had stereopsis a 
capacity for depth perception scott spelled diluvial which 
concerns a flood or deluge but samantha tripped up on pedicled 
arthur then lost out with trinklied and that left only the 
two finalists 
the winners eyes brimmed with tears as he was handed the 
championship trophy and friends and relatives came to the stage and 
embraced him he also received a handshake from the runnerup and 
ojas father 
scott said that he had been studying 104 dictionary words a day 
the number that will fit on a shet of computer paper since 
january he said he has participated in 15 bees counting local 
regional and national contests and has won eight of them 
as for the future he said i might be into words when i get 
older or i might be a pilot 
the runnerup ojas said he had started preparing for spelling 
bees when he was in the third grade he was born in the united 
states but said he has visited the area of northern india that his 
father comes from 
there was one tense moment near the end of the competition when 
the judges ruled that melody yung 12 of fall river mass had 
misspelled salariat a class of salaried persons 
there were cries of dismay from the audience and a flurry of 
activity among the judges they finally played a tape over the 
loudspeaker system which showed she had spelled the word 
salariet and the judges ruling stood

the timing couldnt have been better 
talent and technology coincided beautifully at the end of the 19th 
century for controversial artist aubrey beardsley 
though little trained in art and just 25 when he died of 
tuberculosis in 1898 the drawings beardsley made the last six 
years of his life are credited with influencing such giants of 
20thcentury art as pablo picasso paul klee and edvard munch 
beardsleys black and white drawings usually for book or 
magazine illustrations were printed when not suppressed 
through the then new photomechanical reproduction process said 
miriam stewart a curatorial associate at harvard universitys fogg 
art museum the reproductions were faithful to the drawings and 
cost less than those carved into wood blocks by craftsmen rather 
than the artist 
the fogg has more than 50 of the drawings which were donated by 
two alumni they constitute the most important collection of the 
artists work outside great britain said fogg curator of drawings 
william robinson 
for the first time in six years the drawings are on public 
display and for the first time in more than a dozen years they 
are together in one exhibit and since the drawings are on paper 
making them delicate and sensitive to light they can be exhibited 
only briefly museum officials said 
they will be shown at harvards sackler museum through july 9 
together with other material including books illustrated by 
beardsley loaned by harvards houghton library the boston public 
library and bostons museum of fine arts 
some of the drawings are overtly erotic others have touches 
typical of his mischief 
he usually started his drawings with pencil and perfected them 
with ink stewart said in some he used graphite 
his acquaintances included the playwright oscar wilde and 
beardsley became a sensation with his illustrations for wildes 
play salome published in 1894 the illustraions were 
described variously as having nothing to do with the play and 
everything to do with it stewart said 
included in the fogg exhibit are two drawings intended for the 
book but suppressed from publication 
the show also includes work done for a reprint of malorys le 
morte darthur ben johnsons volpone alexander popes the 
rape of the lock aristophanes lysistrata and for the 
periodicals the yellow book and the savoy 
drawings for bonmots a collection of witticisms are sort 
of elaborate doodles some quite grotesque stewart said 
a voracious reader beardsley sometimes exchanged drawings for 
books and it was through this that his career was launched when he 
was chosen to illustrate le morte darthur he was 20 
some drawings resemble posters and advertisements he was of 
his time and he was not trying to create a lyrical past stewart 
said 
beardsley began writing an erotic novel but never completed it 
he became a roman catholic the year before he died and on his 
death bed asked that some of his drawings be destroyed the 
publisher who had them did not 
the foggs collection came from alumni who had different reasons 
for collecting beardsleys work grenville l winthrop who was 
graduated in 1889 and who descended from the first governor of 
massachusetts bequeathed to harvard 23 original beardsley drawings 
among more than 3700 art objects 
scofield thayer class of 1913 and onetime editor and partowner 
of the literary review the dial had more than 30 drawings that 
became the foggs when he died 
winthrop liked the lines and design of beardsleys work thayer 
liked the daring subject matter robinson said

if youre still wondering what to get the june 
graduate or the june bride why not consider a piece of the 
american economy it grows in value it even beats inflation 
such a gift might put a premium on smart stock selection but 
the chances are the appreciation in market value will beat that of 
the toaster or vase or whatever other gift you might have in mind 
there is a drawback right at the start in that a brokerage fee 
might be paid if the stock is purchased on the open market but 
once over that hurdle the future of your gift is pretty good 
if for instance you purchased sound common stocks and held 
them for five years from 1982 through 1986 you would have enjoyed 
an annual return of nearly 20 percent based on the standard amp 
poors 500stock index 
if continued that sort of return can produce magic a 20 
percent rate for example means you double your money in less than 
four years a rate of return that almost defies comprehension over 
a long period of time 
assume the investment is 100 at the end of the first fouryear 
period it is worth 200 and at the end of the second period 400 
at this point eight years have elapsed 
should the rate of return be maintained which frankly is 
unlikely the original 100 becomes 800 by the end of 12 years 
and 1600 in 16 years the magic of compounding is at work 
after 20 years the original amount is around 3200 and because 
money earned is causing more money to be earned the rate of 
increase is accelerating now 24 years later it is worth 6400 
and growing 
no it isnt all gravy during this time the owner of the stock 
would have had to pay taxes on the dividends earned and while 
taxes on the principle amount are deferred until the stock is sold 
they could be sizeable 
another caveat the period chosen was one of the very best of 
the century returns were high and inflation was low and that 
situation is rather rare a more likely situation would be an 
annual return of 10 percent to 15 percent 
at the latter rate of return there are dozens of sound 
wellmanaged companies to choose from for those whose investing 
skills are wellhoned there are stocks that conceivably might even 
double those rates 
and somewhere out there is another ibm or xerox or polaroid or 
apple computer that might grow at an even more dazzling rate to 
find them however might involve as much luck as skill 
the point to remember is that the american economy is a pretty 
good investment one that is attracting huge amounts of money from 
europe and the far east 
no investment is without risk but one explanation for foreign 
interest is that america is still for all its faults the worlds 
most politically stable large nation and one of the soundest even 
most progressive economically 
for those who dont have sufficient time to get the shares 
recorded it might suffice to inform the recipient that a certain 
sum has been set aside in his or her name and invested in such and 
such a stock 
but if you accept that advice you had better be prepared to 
follow through the pay off may be more than you had bargained on

eskimo women used moss navajo squaws used soft 
bark european women knit them from wool 
for thousands of years diapering has been womens work so its 
no surprise women are championing innovative alternatives to the 18 
billion ecologically suspect disposable diapers plopped into 
landfills or incinerated each year 
in the process these women have spawned a cottage industry 
built around cloth diapers 
gone are the days of pins stuck babies and leaky plastic pants 
the advent of the diaper wrap a pantylike cover that fastens 
snugly with velcro and holds a diaper in place without pins has 
simplified cloth diapering making it a more convenient alternative 
and the method of choice for a growing number of parents 
my main concern was that i didnt want to put plastic on my 
baby i wanted breathability and cloth not paper said margorie 
magidow 38 and mother of three 
in 1983 magidow concocted her own diaper wrap sewing a cover 
that surrounds a cotton diaper and is fastened with velcro she 
added some pizzazz with color made them relatively cheaply and 
used breathable quickdrying nylon 
today she runs a factory with 20 sewers who turned out the more 
than 50000 rubber duckies wraps sold last year through her r duck 
co in santa barbara calif 
id say in the last six months interest has almost doubled 
because so many people are switching to cloth magidow said 
in asheville nc becky kubota is swamped distributing nikkys 
plush wraps made in japan where cloth diapers are the standard 
among the middle and upper classes 
kubota 37 had her first baby in japan 10 years ago and says 
she was in the right place at the right time to become a nikkys 
distributor when she returned home 
the business is really coming to me i havent done a lot to 
market it kubota said last year 120000 nikkys wraps were sold 
nationwide that number should double this year she said 
then theres biobottoms inc an 8yearold company housed in an 
old chicken coop in a rural pocket of marin county calif joan 
cooper and anita dimondstein former college roommates now in their 
40s founded the company on 3000 in pursuit of an alternative to 
plastic pants for their kids 
this year they expect to sell 67000 biobottoms wraps which 
they import from japan 
cooper and dimondstein originally envisioned a home business 
that would occupy some of their time while they raised their 
families today biobottoms employs more than 50 people and puts out 
a catalog that carries 120 products ranging from wraps to 
playclothes to books like koko bears new potty 
some parents launder diapers but more often they rely on diaper 
services that deliver clean cotton diapers and pick up the soiled 
ones from homes the services generally do not provide wraps 
because they are difficult to masslaunder 
a weeks worth of diapers from a service costs 8 to 15 
cheaper than their disposable counterparts assuming a baby needs 
80 diapers a week disposables cost anywhere from 1750 to 20 
but the wraps which come in various sizes are an added 
expense madigows rubber duckies sell for about 550 apiece 
while the topoftheline woolen nikky costs 16 companies 
recommend parents purchase five or six wraps each of which lasts 
through several diaper changes 
wool is considered the best material because its highly 
absorbent and doesnt get cold when wet but cotton covers are more 
popular because theyre cheaper 
dr george sterne a new orleans pediatrician and professor at 
tulane university said he believes babies get fewer rashes with 
cloth diapers and prefers them if they are used without plastic 
pants which provide a warm breeding ground for infections 
according to biobottoms cooper plastic can raise temperatures 
inside the diaper to as high as 104 degrees imagine wearing a 
shower cap 24 hours a day she said 
while no studies have been conducted on who uses cloth diapers 
many advocates suspect its an uppermiddle class trend these 
are environmentally conscious people who shop from catalogs 
kubota said theyre people who take more time to make a purchase 
decision 
sterne generally agreedpeople who are very low income dont 
have washing machines and cant get diaper service he said

as the spanish tenor jose carreras lay in a 
seattle hospital battling leukemia music helped him to get through 
the ordeal music he says has this spiritual strength 
every day i was listening to music with a walkman in my 
sterilized room one of the pieces i had to hear it every day 
was rachmaninoffs piano concerto no 2 i was listening to many 
versions of it also rachmaninoff playing it himself said 
carreras who gave a recital at carnegie hall on may 25 his first 
appearance in more than two years 
the most important thing for me was to save my life all the 
rest came after this he said 
carreras leukemia is now in remission now im not under any 
kind of treatment i have a routine blood test once a month thats 
all i travel around i play some sports i eat anything drink 
anything there are no limitations in my life 
he makes longrange plans including a coproduction next year 
between several european tv networks on the great opera singer 
enrico caruso 
audiences are delighted as the 42yearold carreras makes his 
comeback recitals 
he performed last july before 150000 in barcelona and also 
appeared in vienna at the vatican and in other european cities 
this spring he was in seattle washington and new york in 
february he recorded saintsaens samson et dalila and since 
has recorded halevys la juive for philips in july hell 
return to opera where he made his fame singing in barcelona in 
cherubinis medea with soprano montserrat caballe 
carreras is ranked as one the top tenors in the world but he 
was often taken to task for vocal roughness believed to be caused 
by singing too often and singing roles too heavy for his voice so 
that he had to press for volume 
before my career was the most important thing in my life 
he said like anybody who succeeds i had to fight a lot and have 
a lot of discipline now im more interested to have the 
opportunity to sing on stage again and communicate with people 
through my voice 
carreras thinks his voice is essentially the same but rested 
i was lying in a hospital for nine months it was a hard period 
but my vocal chords were resting thank god all the therapy and 
treatments and radiation did not affect my vocal chords or mucous 
membranes 
maybe as a singer im a little deeper or more mature there is 
a parallel between the artist and the human being 
he plans to include more lyrical roles in my repertoire as he 
gets back to work what is going to change for sure is the rhythm 
of my career i dont plan to sing more than three or four times in 
one month and to have if possible a month of holiday every year 
im going to enjoy not only my professional life that is what 
i did for 17 years but to enjoy also the human side of my life 
more than before he said carreras has two children alberto 
15 and julia 10 
i dont regret at all that i concentrated so much on my 
profession i had a wonderful life 
carreras who sang the part of tony on the west side story 
record conducted by leonard bernstein made the soundtrack for a 
la boheme film in may 1987 that was when he fell ill 
the diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia his doctors in 
spain recommended that he go to seattles fred hutchinson cancer 
research institute seattle also appealed to carreras because he 
felt he would be less of a media event there than in europe 
the treatment was bone marrow transplant they took out my 
bone marrow treated it and gave it back to my body this is a 
revolutionary treatment which needs more and more research he 
said to this end the singer founded the jose carreras 
international foundation for the prevention of leukemia 
it is unbelievable the thousands of letters messages 
telegrams phone calls he said this really touched me so 
much i think that gave me even more the strength to fight 
his next opera appearance after medea will be in a new opera 
about columbus which was postponed when he became sick now hell 
sing the title role in september in barcelona after this i 
think i will go back to opera in vienna covent garden la scala 
and the metropolitan opera 
his time will be divided three ways carreras said among 
singing new roles new recitals new recordings free time 
pleasure sports friends and the foundation meetings 
appointments traveling besides all the performances i give to 
benefit the foundation i have to tell you my life is quite busy 
even though i sing less 
i do everything with such a joy you cannot imagine

jill ker conway was a smart little girl 
who survived the australian wilderness and grew up to be an 
intellectual refugee fleeing an impossible mother and a sexist 
society 
its a sometimes harrowing story the 54yearold historian 
feminist and former president of smith college tells in her memoir 
the road from coorain knopf 1895 
right through to the close of her account she voices the pained 
discontent that has sent many australians far from that isolated 
island continent in the pacific the memoir ends in 1960 at the 
airport in sydney standing on the tarmac of long goodbyes she is 
26 and on her way to study american history at harvard university 
i was leaving because i didnt fit in never had and wasnt 
likely to she writes i was going to another country to begin 
all over again 
where i wondered would my bones come to rest it pained me 
to think of them not fertilizing australian soil 
since landing here the australian expatriate has made a 
brilliant career she earned a doctorate at harvard served as the 
first woman vice president at the university of toronto and in 
1975 began a 10year stint at smith that put her on the cover of 
time magazine as a woman to watch in the year of women 
congressmen solicited her opinion on education so often that in 
1978 she became a us citizen her honorary degrees could paper a 
large wall and she serves on a slew of corporate boards from 
colgatepalmolive to nike 
now a visiting scholar and teacher at the massachusetts 
institute of technology she is turning out an unconventional 
trilogy she hopes will light a fire under a generation grown 
complacent about equal rights for women one book is about third 
world women a second will be a womens history of the past 25 
years in the context of american life the third is her memoir 
which offers a personal view of women in a world run by men 
jill ker conway is a tall genteel woman who speaks in a 
nearwhisper and has an inquisitive open face she has no regrets 
about leaving the land of her birth she said in a recent interview 
australia is a culture obsessed with the anarchic male hero 
from ned kelly a revered australian outlaw to crocodile 
dundee she said men in australia suffer a great deal from 
having that as an ideal women have no territory in that country 
its not that i dont like men but you need a world that 
recognizes there are two sexes 
conways account of how she broke away from that place tells of 
a young woman who battled outrageous misfortune to fulfill her 
potential in a stunningly direct nononsense australian way she 
describes a sometimes harrowing childhood the emerging power of 
her largely selftaught intellect and her anguished decision to 
leave her bitter and possessive mother 
for starters she explains that she wasnt even meant to be born 
her mother and father were eking out a life on coorain an 
aboriginal word meaning windy place an 18000acre sheep 
station in the flat plains of outback new south wales australias 
southeastern quadrant the kers settled there in 1929 during a 
drought 
they already had two sons when mrs ker discovered in 1934 that 
she was pregnant again a nursegonebush she attempted in vain to 
abort the fetus jill ker was born without incident however 
at coorain the family lived in a weatherboard bungalow with 
wide verandas and a corrugated iron roof it was a lonely place of 
punishing heat in summer and the alternating threat of floods and 
fatal dry spells sustenance in the early days consisted of meat 
potatoes eggs and pickles when it rained there was wild spinach 
but in the general absence of fresh fruit and vegetables there was 
cod liver oil and lime juice 
the family read by kerosene lamps the books that arrived in the 
mail from a lending library 500 miles away in sydney 
the sheep station prospered however by age 6 conway was 
helping her father muster sheep check fences and maintain 
windmills he also taught her to be stoical and not to cry but 
drought returned and five years of dust storms dying sheep and a 
depressed father came to a tragic end when the father drowned 
trying to extend piping in a dam conway was 10 
the family packed up and moved to sydney there the precocious 
autodidact with a huge vocabulary from all those borrowed books was 
accepted at an elite girls school she went on to the prestigious 
university of sydney and graduated at the top of her class but 
when she tried to join the australian foreign service she was 
turned down on grounds that she was too attractive and too 
intellectually aggressive 
all the while her mother grew increasingly critical and 
dependent violating her own sense of duty and quiet suffering 
conway decided she had enough and fled to harvard 
it helped cinch the decision that boston and cambridge were 
about as far away from sydney as one can get on this planet and 
that id be totally safe from family visits she wrote 
in the nearly 30 years since then jill ker married canadian 
john conway now 73 and a retired historian they spent 11 years 
teaching in canada until 1975 when she took over at smith 
in her decade in northampton running the prestigious liberal 
arts college conway introduced major programs in business 
management and womens studies enriched smiths endowment from 82 
million to 179 million and for the first time made room among 
the schools 2500 places for older women and welfare mothers 
she said the book of her early life was written for several 
reasons including honoring the courage of her parents and 
recording a vanished way of life theres a feminist message too 
it is very important to find some rhetoric that will 
communicate to a broad public about feminist issues conway said 
young women think theyre all solved

nancy reagan urged kids to just say 
no to drugs and national drug policy chief william bennett said 
its ok to just say who is using now judges want drug 
offenders to name their suppliers 
a month after judges in knox and anderson counties began asking 
it they say the question is worthwhile but defense attorneys and 
even the knox county sheriff wonder whether it violates protections 
against selfincrimination ends judges neutrality puts 
defendants at risk and threatens other cases 
it seems to me theres everything to gain and nothing to lose 
assuming im not trampling on their constitutional rights said 
knox county criminal court judge randy nichols who figures most of 
his criminal cases boil down to drug use 
criminal court judges in the two counties on may 5 began asking 
people convicted of possession or sale of drugs to name their 
suppliers in a program modeled after one in columbus neb the 
judges consider defendants cooperation in deciding plea bargains 
and refusal could earn a contempt of court charge punishable by up 
to 10 days in jail and a 50 fine 
in columbus platte county juvenile court judge gerald rouse 
says more than 40 other jurisdictions have called for information 
on the countys yearold policy requiring offenders to name 
suppliers of drugs or alcohol 
frankly we dont have to do it very often once the word got 
around and the first two went to jail we didnt have much of a 
problem rouse said 
the policy has led to only a halfdozen supplier convictions he 
said 
in tennessee if a supplier name surfaces its up to a 
prosecutor to take it down and decide whether to investigate 
further nichols said so far only a handful of cases have evoked 
the question 
when james daugherty of oak ridge sought probation on a charge 
of selling cocaine anderson county criminal court judge james 
scott asked it 
daugherty named crazy joe as his supplier crazy joe 
newton it turned out had been found dead earlier in the year 
scott gave daugherty four years in prison not because of his 
answer but rather his background daugherty may have been telling 
the truth scott said but he notes the convenience and wonders 
whether there will be an onslaught of phantom sellers 
nichols asked the question may 17 of jeffrey clark evans who 
agreed to plead guilty to robbery assault and marijuana charges in 
exchange for a 17year sentence defense attorney bob simpson 
objected and told his client not to answer because the judge was no 
longer neutral simpson also said the question violated his 
clients fifth amendment right because police could go to the 
supplier who in turn could implicate evans on unrelated crimes 
nichols took no action and scheduled another hearing on the case 
other defense attorneys including bob ritchie of knoxville 
believe appeals courts may kill the policy 
for 200 years we have administered criminal justice by the 
investigative method ritchie said to require a person to give 
evidence of any kind is an inquisitorial method of criminal 
justice that is abhorrent to the basic foundations of freedom on 
which this country is founded 
nichols said conviction means loss of fifth amendment rights 
and that the judges arent interested in further charging that 
person if he tells me joe jones sold it and another week someone 
else tells us joe jones sold it thatll be useful information for 
the attorney general he said 
knox county sheriff joe fowler who favors the policy generally 
wonders whether offenders safety might be hurt or if another 
pending investigation damaged by asking the supplier question in a 
public courtroom nichols said prosecutors could interview the 
offender privately and report to the judge 
all the kinks arent ironed out yet he said 
in nebraska the policy also was questioned regarding 
constitutionality but is unchallenged legally it has mainly been 
aimed at juveniles who could lose their drivers licenses for 
refusing to answer but adults could face jail 
i cant say its as successful as id like it to be rouse 
said 
in platte county with 27000 residents there are usually about 
130 cases of minors possessing alcohol and 20 of drug possession a 
year he said what leads into the heavier drugs is the 
consumption of alcohol and marijuana 
if we dont let them get away with the small things they 
wont even think about the big stuff

when you shop for tomatoes you take what 
looks good and firm you hope it will taste good tomato varieties 
are not labeled in the supermarket but when you buy tomato plant 
seedlings you have a wide selection 
a team of scientists at the florida agricultural experiment 
station at bradenton fla make 800 plant crosses annually in 
search of better tomatoes they evaluate about 40000 plants each 
year 
the plant breeders goal is to increase disease and insect 
resistance improve flavor increase plant yield and improve the 
size of the fruit and the form for shipping to market 
if you buy tomato seedlings youll notice the letters at least 
some of them v f n or t after the variety name these refer to 
the seedlings resistance to verticillium wilt fusarium wilt 
nematodes or tobacco mosaic plant diseases disease tolerance is 
very important especially if you plant in the same place every 
year in a small garden plot 
its also important to consider the varietys growth habit 
whether it is determinate or indeterminate 
determinate varieties are those that ripen pretty much at the 
same time a boon for instance if you will be canning or making 
sauces or juices 
indeterminate plants will continue growth and production during 
the season providing fruit until frost the precise number of days 
to maturity will vary with the weather 
plant tomatoes 30 to 36 inches apart using stocky healthy 
plants in full sun in moist welldrained soil cage or stake 
tomato plants to speed ripening save space and to keep fruits 
from rotting on the ground plastic mulch will help keep moisture 
in the ground around the plants to hasten ripening and to discourge 
weeds 
some tomatoes do better than others in patio containers 
select the tomato you prefer according to size and taste some 
people prefer tart tomatoes while others enjoy sweet ones 
for size choose small cherry tomatoes for salads or dipping 
pear or plumshaped tomatoes for preserves pasta types for sauce 
ketchup and canning beefsteak tomatoes for slicing 
the following tomato recipes were provided by wayne hawkins 
executive vice president of the florida tomato exchange 
baked tomatoes au gratin 
2 pounds tomatoes

four women in white lab coats seat 
themselves in a row of cubicles before each is a tray with a 
disposable cup a glass of water a paper graph and six amber 
bottles of rancid milk 
they take a swig from each bottle and swish it inside their 
mouths they grimace spit into the disposable cups and rinse their 
mouths with water they scribble then on to the next amber bottle 
when the tasting and scribbling are done each shoves her tray 
through a metal slot in the cubicle 
tester no 1 wipes her mouth and says let me see if i can 
find a candy bar somewhere they all laugh 
the women are graduate students at the university of tennessees 
department of food technology and science and theyre putting 
their persnickety palates to work at the departments sensory 
laboratory in the buildings basement 
these days the testers are trying to find out exactly how long 
it takes milk to get rancid and to distinguish between degrees of 
rancidness also they are developing exact descriptive words that 
they hope will become standard language for dairy producers and 
grocery stores or anyone else dealing with milk 
the lab has also tested such experimental treats as sweet potato 
yogurt shrimpflavored snack chips mutton patties with various 
animal fats and microwavebaked cakes 
the information is published in scientific magazines such as the 
journal of food science and the journal of food quality sometimes 
food companies themselves hire the lab and its testers to find out 
how omission or substitution of certain ingredients affects their 
products whether preservatives affect flavor or whether people 
like the food 
there are basically three different kinds of tests says 
marjorie penfield professor of grain and baking sensory 
evaluation theres one on whether products are different for 
example if a company wants to change an ingredient in a product to 
something cheaper or maybe the companys supplier doesnt make the 
same ingredient any more 
then theres description of the quality of that product in 
industry highly trained panelists are used to describe the 
product they have to be able to taste the product and completely 
describe it and the intensity of those qualities people are 
realizing we have to have some kind of standard lexicology 
we also do testing in which you ask whether the person likes 
the product penfield says 
the laboratory testers tend to specialize there are panels that 
zero in on green beans and panels that study the difference between 
steaks from grassfed and grainfed cattle 
some of the rancid milk panelists also evaluate microwavebaked 
cakes as to their air pockets resistance to cutting crumbliness 
and springiness the degree to which 2 centimeters of cake return 
to original form 2 seconds after being compressed 
we smash it down with a fork and then measure how much it 
sprang up says tester marsha mcneil 
other areas of cake study are cell size size of holes in 
the cake moisture release amount of wetness or oiliness 
released in the mouth by the cake and cohesiveness of mass 
degree to which cake holds together for up to 10 chews aftermath 
qualities such as adhesion to teeth amount of cake stuck to 
teeth after swallowing also are noted 
some foods almost defy precise description and panelists must 
be nearly on the same wavelength penfield says 
with grassfed beef youre looking for a grassy flavor she 
says it doesnt really taste like grass i have a hard time 
describing it but i certainly notice it when i taste it she 
explained as other testers nodded in agreement 
its described as a milkyoily flavor its the type of beef 
found in the less expensive steak houses she says

pizza is the favorite food among kids 6 to 14 
years of age according to a recent poll by the editors of kid city 
and 321 contact magazines 
over 25 percent of the more than 12000 respondents to the 
magazines survey selected pizza as their favorite food most of 
those said they thought that pizza was probably bad for them but 
they liked it anyway 
the survey showed that kids sometimes have their nutritional 
facts wrong as is the case with pizza which is basically a 
nutritious food 
in other cases kids know a food like fish for example is good 
for them but they seldom eat it even though they may like it 
some 82 percent reported that they know fish is healthful and 52 
percent said they like it yet only 34 percent eat it regularly 
possibly because their parents dont prepare it for them 
as for vegetables nearly 61 percent of the respondents between 
the ages of 6 to 10 said they regularly eat vegetables even though 
they may not like them in the 8 to 14yearold category 82 
percent said they regularly include vegetables among the foods they 
eat 
the magazines are urging their young readers to eat vegetables 
unsweetened cereals fresh fruit and yogurt and to avoid lots of 
fried foods and fizzy soft drinks 
kid city and 321 contact magazines are published by the 
childrens television workshop which produces sesame street 
and other educational television programs 
a book by the childrens television workshop parents guide to 
feeding your kids right which deals with good nutrition from 
birth through the teenage years is scheduled for publication this

determining financial need they do not penalize those who have

although gravity was the first discovered of the four known 
natural forces that govern events in nature it is the least 
understood and the only force that humans cannot control says 
national geographic 
 
 
gravity rules the universe but any kitchen magnets 
electromagnetic field is stronger over a space of a few inches 
than the earths entire gravitational field 
 
 
earths gravity field is so weak that when you pick up a rock 
your muscles are easily overcoming the pull of the planets entire 
66 sextillion tons 
 
 
was galileo wrong some scientists today suggest that a 
mysterious previously unknown natural force may counteract 
gravity making objects fall at different not the same rates of 
acceleration 
 
 
some scientists today believe that a previously unknown natural 
antigravity force makes an iron weight fall more slowly although 
to an extremely small degree than an aluminium one says national 
geographic 
 
 
if humans could harness the mysterious antigravity force that 
some scientists suspect may exist in nature someday there might be 
craneless construction and cableless elevators 
 
 
gravity governs the height and shape of our bodies also 
dictating the size and shape of organs and limbs 
 
 
in the aging process sagging skin and organs varicose veins 
arthritis and failing hearts all result partly from the losing 
battle against gravity 
 
 
if humans had evolved on the moon with onesixth earths 
gravity they might be double their height but too spindly to play 
basketball on jupiter they might look like pancakes with short 
legs says national geographic 
 
 
gravity meters may someday be used by security agents because 
they can detect extremely subtle changes in an intruders position 
and can even find a person behind a wall 
 
 
gravity ultimately could cause the end of the universe some 
physicists think if its current expansion eventually reverses 
itself in a massive gravitational contraction

a flagstone patio is attractive practical and creates a bridge 
between your house and the outdoors 
it is best built on a level or gently sloping site when 
designing it consider shade privacy and access from the house 
avoid placing it where an overhanging roof will drip water on it as 
heavy rains can cause the stones to settle unevenly 
flagstones come in many sizes starting at a nominal 12inch 
stone and increasing by 6inch increments to 36 inches and 
occasionally 42 inches in reality the stones are slightly 
smaller by about a inch in each direction use the nominal size 
in your plans since a small space is left between stones 
although sold as 1 inches thick they actually range from 1 to 
2 inches compensate for this by putting more or less sanwdy3xd 
beneath each stone 
when ordering specify the size of your patio the length and 
width should be divisible by six inches

lay the patio on a 3inch bed of sand over a 4inch gravel 
base for drainage in areas where ground freezes it is best to 
lay a patio on a reinforced concrete base 
use crushed aggregate for the gravel and concrete sand which 
is coarser than masons sand 
order these by the cubic yard to calculate the amount needed 
multiply thickness by width by length be sure all measurements are 
in feet for example 4 inches equals 13rd foot then divide the 
product by 27 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
1 when the flagstones arrive measure each and record its 
dimensions 
2 make a scale drawing of the patio on graph paper let 1 inch 
equal 1 foot 
3 using colored paper cut out a shape representing each stone 
label each piece and move the pieces around on the graph paper 
until you get a pleasing pattern 
4 paste the shapes on the graph paper this is your plan

you will need a spade iron rake wheelbarrow hand cart 
optional prybar stonemasons chisel masons hammer or steel 
mallet hammer broom garden hose safety goggles disposable 
paintbrush carpenters level string scissors 4d galvanized 
nails 1by8 pine for forms 1by4 stakes 11 to 12 inches long 
creosote a 2by4 for leveling and another for tamping 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
1 drive temporary stakes at the patio corners allowing 1 
inches extra on each side for wooden forms run string between the 
stakes to outline the patio measure the diagonals if the patio is 
a true rectangle they will be equal 
2 dig out the soil to a depth of 8 inches be sure the bottom 
of the excavation is level set aside some turf and topsoil for 
later use 
3 paint creosote on the 1by8 boards for the forms also paint 
permanent 1by4 stakes 
4 place the 1by8 boards around the perimeter of the 
excavation drive the permanent stakes at the corners and 
additional stakes where the ends of the boards meet nail stakes to 
form boards with 4d nails 
5 spread gravel in the excavated area to a depth of 4 inches 
rake it smooth then use a 2by4 level to pack it place 
carpenters level on top of the 2by4 and move it around to check 
the gravel is level 
6 spread sand over the gravel level and pack it 
7 begin laying stones following the pattern you made leave a 
inch gap between stones stand on each stone to make sure it 
doesnt teeter use a prybar to raise one edge of the stone to 
shift its position or to add or remove sand beneath it to make it 
level with the other stones tamp stones down with a rubber mallet 
8 mix sand with some topsoil spread the mixture on the patio 
and sweep it into the spaces between the stones water the surface 
to pack down the mixture let dry repeat with more sand and soil 
until the joints are filled pack the edges of the patio and cover 
the dirt with the turf removed earlier 
9 perimeter stones may have to be cut to fit if so wear 
safety goggles pencil a line where a piece is to be cut score 
along the line using a chisel and hammer or steel mallet score a 
line on opposite face place a board under the stone with the 
section to be removed overhanging tap the excess section with the 
hammer or mallet until it breaks off

q the wallboard in our living room needs patching i can 
handle most of the job but im not sure how to go about filling 
the few spots where there are openings in the wall without anything 
behind them can i apply masking tapes over each opening and then 
cover with a patching compound 
a yes but one of the modern products that will fill the bill 
is a readymade patch available in most paint stores and home 
centers tape it on according to the directions and you will find 
it easy to disguise the patch when it is painted

q one of the doublehung windows in our house has gone 
haywire i am fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord can 
the cord be removed or is it too much of a job 
a removing the sash is not difficult merely take off the 
stop mouldings on the inside use a chisel or putty knife and work 
very carefully especially if you intend to use the mouldings 
again if your aim is to replace the sash cord with another of the 
same type be sure to observe how the cord is connected so you will 
be able to replace it without too much trouble before you do this 
however look into the kinds of sash cords now on the market they 
are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible

if the finish is shellac lacquer or something else 
a go ahead with the varnish remover the finish will yield to 
it whether it is varnish shellac or lacquer what will determine 
the toughness of your job is how many coats are on it after the 
varnish remover is left on the amount of time recommended on the 
label try a little scraping with a putty knife or scraper if it 
yields fairly easy go ahead with the work if it seems to resist 
apply another coat of remover without disturbing the coat already

the new grove dictionary of american music has in its four 
volumes a number of entries on jazz but for its the new grove 
dictionary of jazz the british company didnt just reprint those 
entries and add others it hired an american jazz musicologist and 
saxophonist 38yearold barry kernfeld as editor and started 
fresh as a matter of fact the jazz dictionary was kernfelds idea 
as a performer kernfeld says i was never better than a good 
local professional i wouldnt take my horn out of the case in new 
york city since marathon work on the dictionary began four years 
ago he hasnt taken his horn out of the case anyplace 
an adviser on kernfelds cornell university phd dissertation 
on improvisation in miles davis 195859 sextet which included 
john coltrane and cannonball adderley suggested to grove that 
kernfeld be hired to write about jazz for the dictionary of 
american music he wrote about 60 articles then he thought there 
should be a grove dictionary concentrating on jazz 
it was a daunting terrifying idea he says i didnt 
mention it to anyone but my friends for the next two years i was 
teaching history of jazz parttime at cornell and playing sax in a 
jazz quartet 
then sally his wife since 1981 got an assistant professorship 
at penn state in february 1984 secure that one of them had a 
fulltime job kernfeld sent grove a proposal for a jazz dictionary 
in march in april he was hired and started planning by the end 
of the year we were in full swing he says 
one approach new for jazz kernfeld says is the way in which 
we write about instruments it is traditional in jazz to talk about 
instruments by naming people sol yaged plays like benny goodman 
youd find that comment under yaged but not under clarinet in 
grove in instrument entries kernfeld says what weve tried 
to do is talk about the instrument and how its used in jazz rather 
than naming instrumentalists 
there are catalogs of festivals libraries and nightclubs 
there are reading lists and a full bibliography at the end big 
theoretical articles are also a grove idea an 11page discussion 
of jazz in movies is found under films theres a 9page article 
on jazz improvisation that one i wrote kernfeld says i 
wrote several hundred 
there are of course entries for individuals branford 
marsalis had emerged as a major figure in time for us kernfeld 
says by the time diane schuur hit we were past commissioning 
articles most of our commissioning was done by 1986 
when asked how individuals were chosen kernfeld says we 
tried to put in people who had a lasting association with jazz and 
musicians of international renown who recorded regularly as 
soloists it is flexible it is music not science 
an exception kernfeld says is sidemen who played with a 
series of distinguished bands or one distinguished band for a 
career but were not soloists for instance freddie green is 
listed he drove the basie rhythm section with the fluidity of his 
strumming on the guitar it really doesnt matter if he ever played 
a solo in his life he is tremendously important for defining one 
aspect of the swing style 
about 10 percent of the articles are taken from the american 
music dictionary often with extensive revision 
kernfeld says jazz record labels turned out to be one of the 
hardest things to get information on detailed coverage is 
available to world war ii a lot of labels have disappeared we 
didnt know where to look 
theres a discussion of facsimile reissues which have come in 
in this decade with personnel lists original liner notes and 
photos thats very important in jazz one of my private theories 
about why cassettes never caught on in jazz the way they have in 
other genres is that the packaging of jazz takes on a greater 
importance than it might elsewhere

surprise leica the cadillac of cameras has entered the 
pointandshoot market 
the leica r reflex and m rangefinder cameras now have an 
autofocus and autoexposure sibling the new camera called the 
afc1 has a suggested retail price of 698 less than the cost of 
a typical leica lens now you know why leica is called the 
cadillac of cameras 
the afc1 is a duallens system with both 40mm f20 and 80mm 
f56 capability the autofocus system projects five independent 
infrared beams so that it can focus on a subject that is not in the 
center of the viewfinder the shutter release can actuate a focus 
lock for outofcenter subjects the camera focuses from 28 inches 
to infinity in less than a second 
the autoexposure system uses centerweighted integral 
measurements with automatic correction in cases of high contrast 
it has dx coding that sets film speeds from asa 50 to 3200 with 
noncoded film the camera exposes for asa 100 
coupled to the exposure system is a builtin flash that operates 
automatically in low light when contrasts are extreme and in 
backlighted situations when the lens is switched from wideangle 
to tele the flash angle is changed accordingly and the distance of 
the flash reflector from the optical axis is altered to reduce the 
possibility of redeye the flash recycles in two seconds and can 
be operated manually 
the viewfinder shows the autofocus frame and parallax indicators 
for closeups a green light in the finder indicates that there is 
adequate available light a flash symbol appears when the flash has 
cut in and a red dot shows that it is not yet fully charged 
another symbol warns the user that the subject is too close 
the afc1 features autoloading to the first frame a selftimer 
and automatic rewind you can also powerrewind midway through a 
roll of film a lithium battery powers the camera 
the new camera should become available at leica dealers in june

in the world of the personal computer the fountain of youth is 
limited even if you have unlimited funds 
its limited because there comes a point where buying addons to 
increase the vigor of an aging pc becomes a losing proposition 
however for most of us spending up to 1000 to rejuvenate the 
machine we have is smarter than spending 1500 and up sometimes 
way up to get a new one 
the june issue of compute magazine has an article that outlines 
ways to put currentlevel power into your msdos macintosh or 
commodore amiga in general the idea is to expand your machine in 
the areas critical to your main use 
if your computer is used primarily to play games for example 
you might want to expand the memory to accommodate todays 
ramhungry simulations or boost the graphics display with a card 
that handles more monitor resolution and a monitor to match 
or you might want to expand storage with a hard disk or boost 
the power of your output by upgrading to an inkjet printer if 
video is your thing and you have an amiga you might want to 
purchase a genlock a widget that mixes live video and amiga 
graphics for taping on a vcr 
even if your machine isnt among those mentioned you should 
consider trying to boost performance before shopping for a new box 
apple ii machines for example while fairly old in the computing 
scheme of things are very expandable and in the msdos world 
upgrading the 8088 processor in your pc to an intel 80286 the kind 
used in the pc at can bring you improved numbercrunching and 
graphic performance at a fraction of the cost and bother of a new 
machine 
read the article for details including manufacturers and 
prices but remember not to get carried away a soupedup older pc 
that costs more than twothirds above the original purchase price 
should make you wonder if patience and a bit of saving wouldnt 
be the best bet

just about the time that the cold war seems to be cooling down 
among the superpowers its heating up in the software simulation 
arena where every other release seems to detail an americansoviet 
confrontation microprose international has released red storm 
rising for the ibm pc if you want to fight your war as a submarine 
commander this one cant be missed it requires an ibm pc or 
compatible with at least 384000 characters of memory a color or 
monochrome graphics adapter a 525inch disk drive 5495 and 
nerves of steel 
the simulation is based on the bestselling novel by tom clancy 
who wrote a foreword for the 100page operations manual kevin 14 
and the compubug house expert on games that go boom was impressed 
this simulation keeps up with microproses high standards for 
detail authenticity and realism the graphics are excellent i 
reviewed it in tandy 1000 graphics 16 colors i especially 
recommend the ww iii simulation in this you follow a series of 
battles in the norwegian sea theater one of your losses may result 
in a major warsaw pact offensive changing the view of all of 
europe as you play for example if the warsaw pact is taking the 
offensive west germany slowly fills in red making you feel you 
should start winning your battles 
to play the ww iii simulation you need at least 90 minutes 
you can save the game between battles but only one battle at a 
time makes it little fun i would recommend this game to anyone 13 
years or older because you cant appreciate it without some 
knowledge of nato and warsaw pact differences i would also 
recommend a hard drive although not required

the day after their house burned to the ground in princeton 
nj evelyn and arthur krosnick drove to george nakashimas studio 
in new hope pa there they asked the 84yearold american 
craftsman to replace all 110 pieces of his work that had been 
destroyed 
we might even come up with something better said nakashima 
one of the leading figures in american design and a pioneer among 
contemporary furniture makers 
two pieces were spared destruction when a plumbers torch set 
off the fire both were on loan to the american craft museum in new 
york city for an exhibition of nakashimas work since 1945 the 
exhibit runs through aug 13 
the krosnicks collection of nakashima furniture spans 30 years 
and their house had been designed to accommodate it they tracked 
down the blueprints and vow to rebuild 
devotion to nakashima is a trait the krosnicks share with a 
large group of admirers that includes happy rockefeller whose 
tarrytown ny home has 220 examples of nakashimas furniture 
we recognize george nakashima as a national treasure i think 
we have become better people because of his influence says 
evelyn krosnick 
even those who dont own his furniture may have felt his 
influence according to derek e ostergard curator of the 
exhibition and author of the book george nakashima full 
circle weidenfeld amp nicolson 40 
nakashima influenced a generation of young collegeeducated 
americans to work with their hands 
his deceptively simple furniture combines magnificent wood an 
oil finish that emphasizes the wood grain fine workmanship and a 
mix of contemporary and traditional forms 
these things are so powerful so sensual people can hardly 
keep from touching them says ostergard i dont know of work 
like this elsewhere 
no two pieces are alike yet many especially the tables 
feature a freeform edge which ostergard defines as the outer 
profile of a tree trunk just beneath the bark 
nakashima an american of japanese descent who was interned in 
an idaho relocation camp in 194243 has written extensively about 
how important his japanese roots are to him 
born in spokane wash and educated at massachusetts institute 
of technology he worked as an architect in japan before learning 
furnituremaking from a japanese woodworker 
yet ostergard says nakashimas design philosophy is inspired by 
the arts and crafts movement a western invention and his 
furniture is based on european joinery and forms such as the 
windsor chair most japanese furniture is built in and lacquered 
nakashima who does not make builtins nearly always works with 
grained wood 
during his internment nakashima teamed up with a 
japanesetrained carpenter i learned a great deal from him he 
says 
after the war nakashima set up shop in new hope and collectors 
began beating a path to his door today the shop is open only a 
few hours on saturday afternoons browsers may find a small stool 
or side table for 200 or so but most work is made to order and a 
large dining table for example might cost 20000 
the krosnicks discovered his work there in the 1950s they 
ascribe to his belief that the best way to acquire furniture is 
to buy something wonderful and keep it for your whole life and 
then pass it on to your children we feel permanence that way 
nakashimas workshop with 10 employees is actually a small 
factory with an annual output of as many as 1000 pieces it took 
less than two years to produce the 220 items for the rockefeller 
house 
helping nakashima run the company are his daughter mirra 
nakashimayarnall an architect and second in command his wife 
marion and son kevin 
nakashimas pieces are made of solid wood not veneer he 
regrets having to fell fine trees even the title of his book is 
the soul of a tree but says he if we dont get it someone 
else will we feel we can give the tree a second life

sweden will lower its highway speed 
limit to 55 mph 90 kilometers this summer in an effort to save 
lives and reduce pollution from auto emissions 
but police doubt it will work they say its hard enough to 
enforce the current 68 mph limit and automobile association 
officials call the measure too drastic 
the new limit will be in effect june 22aug 20 when traffic 
usually increases by about 30 percent 
the environment has been a concern in swedish politics for years 
and was a key issue in last falls election the longentrenched 
social democrats were returned to power but the environment party 
won enough votes to become the first new party in parliament in 
more than 60 years 
swedish highways join those of norway and ireland as the slowest 
in europe west germany has no top limit on its autobahns and most 
other european countries have a 62 to 74 mph limit 
authorities argue that the lower limit will cut emissions of 
nitrogen oxides by 35 to 40 percent nitrogen oxides cause acid 
rain 
tomas nilson of the automobile association which has 200000 
members says car emissions have extremely marginal effects on 
the environment 
he says the association has a certain understanding for the 
decision to lower speed limits if it can save lives but it is 
wrong to lower speeds everywhere 
the governments decision attempts to reverse a trend of the 
last several years of faster driving on swedish roads even though 
speed limits were not increased police blame speeding on more 
powerful cars and drivers under more stress in their daily lives 
traffic police have had little success combating speeding even 
though they deployed more motorcycle cops helicopters radar and 
cars equipped with speedrecording video cameras 
the governments traffic council agency said in a report that 
with the slower speeds this summer between 10 and 20 lives could 
be saved and 100 to 200 fewer people would be injured 
in recent months road deaths have increased sharply especially 
on highways 
the cars are faster and better says police inspector rune 
pelli but it is the same old human being who is driving

on the a9 motorway netherlands ap the young couple rented a 
1936 rolls royce for their wedding day when the fanbelt snapped 
it was the road service that got them to the church on time 
the road service is the netherlands 24hour repair service and 
its legendary mechanics in their yellow cars dont give up easily 
i had a quick look through my supplies and i just happened to 
have the right belt said mechanic ruud lucken recalling how he 
got the rolls rolling 
because the hapless couples chauffeur was one of the 23 
million members of the road service the emergency call cost just 
the price of the fanbelt 
not a towing operation the road service is renowned for its 
mechanics expertise with almost any model among the 56 million 
cars trucks and buses that crowd this small nations highway 
system 
its 650 radiodispatched vehicles deal with an average of 2000 
breakdowns a day providing a mechanical safety net for motorists 
in this cradletograve welfare state 
the road service began in 1946 with a handful of volunteers and 
a fleet of seven harleydavidson liberator motorcycles left behind 
by world war ii allied forces 
although some motorcycles are still in use most mechanics drive 
compact cars carrying more than 880 pounds of power and hand tools 
fuel water lubricants and spare parts 
road service vehicles patrol all major dutch highways and with 
a tollfree telephone call are usually at the scene of a breakdown 
within minutes 
owned by the royal dutch tourist association the road service 
has an annual membership fee of 2225 for that service which can 
include up to two hours of labor members pay only for parts tips 
are forbidden 
nonmembers can get help as well but the price is onthespot 
membership 
to protect against abuse mechanics limit their work to 
emergency repairs designed to get the car back in motion 
mechanic jan brand tells of one call for a highway breakdown 
the motorist had apparently had the car towed there to take 
advantage of the free service the engine was cold and the 
motorists policy only covered highway repairs 
for a small annual surcharge the road service provides repairs 
anywhere even in the owners garage 
the key to the road services success is its mechanics who are 
expected to know everything there is to know about every single 
car says wim van dink chief of the training program 
mechanics spend 2 years learning how to repair everything 
from a motorcycle to the heaviest type of truck as well as 
firefighting and first aid techniques van dijk says 
occasionally you have to face the fact that theres something 
wrong with a car that you cant fix said brand as he cruised 
this amsterdamarea highway on the lookout for car trouble 
but no cars getting towed away he said unless i know at 
least whats wrong with it 
the road service mechanics load is lightened considerably by 
dutch government regulations requiring mechanical tests for all 
vehicles over three years old 
nowadays they dont make any more really bad cars says 
brand of course some are more breakdownprone than others

no matter how well planned family vacations are 
never perfect but there are some things you can do to ease the 
stress of traveling with children 
to hent 
pieces 
taking the right accessories along is easier when you plan 
your wardrobe and then work your plan says terrymayer a new 
york fashion consultant and jewelry designer 
basics she says can be made to fit the occasion with the 
proper shoes belt handbag and jewelry scarf or hat 
a diary of what you have worn with your favorite separates or 
suits makes sense she says if you know what you have you can 
plan what you need 
one basic that is coming around again is the shirtwaist dress 
someone once said it has a thousand and one ways of looking 
terrymayer says it is like adding the dressing to a salad to 
give it its name 
the shirtwaist of course can be of any one of a multitude of 
fabrics it can be straight from the shoulder to the shirttail hem 
to be cinched by a belt or tie or left loose or it can have a 
defined waistline with one of several skirt styles pleated 
gathered flared straight 
as for accessories says terrymayer this is the year of the 
bangle bracelet for fashion impact wear several at once perhaps 
even six it is the time of the charm bracelet which gives you the 
chance to show your major interests on your arm in the summer 
the sea and its charms look so withit 
it is wise to know that it is not the value of the accessory 
that counts but the way you feel about it for you to give it its 
display 
what you wear takes on your personality 
when traveling this summer says terrymayer take along some 
lightweight colorful earrings some bangles and perhaps some chains 
for your necktake jewelry you wont have to worry about she 
sayspack it in a small silk square and tie it hobo fashion 
and remember that whatever you choose to take its beauty is 
in the eye of the beholder and its role is to accent you

whether youre scanning the horizon from a 
cruise ship going on a biggame photo shoot in africa backpacking 
in a state park or birding from your back deck binoculars are 
standard equipment 
depending on quality they range in price from about 50 to more 
than 900 but says mark abrams of clairmontnichols optics in new 
york only 15 percent of people who come in for binoculars know 
what type of glasses they should buy to fit their needs 
before buying says bob meichsner of swarovski optik you should 
decide their primary use and bone up on binoculartalk know 
especially the meaning of the two numbers the dealer will refer to 
ie 7x42 the first number is the magnification the x is 
shorthand for power and the second number is the objective lens 
diameter 
so 7x means the binoculars will make objects look seven times 
bigger than they really are the 42 is the diameter in millimeters 
of each of the front lenses called objective lenses the wider the 
objective lens the more light and thus a better image 
a good generalpurpose pair of binoculars can be selected from 
7x42 7x50 or 8x30 models

tax tips for the disorganized 
as you think back on the pain associated with preparing your 
1988 tax return consider how much of it was selfinflicted because 
of your failure to keep decent files last year jeffrey mayer a 
chicago consultant thinks about such things and makes his living 
at 250 an hour telling clients how to efficiently manage their 
time and their paperwork 
his advice for tax records buy a box of file folders the kind 
with staggered tabs rather than try to think of all the tax 
categories for which you need separate files just label the files 
a to z beginning today file all paid bills receipts and other 
documents that might have a tax consequence alphabetically 
its up to you whether to file your visa bills under v by 
the name of the issuing bank or under c for credit just decide 
and stick with it label separate files for your investments one 
for mutual funds one for brokerage accounts and so on 
the point is to set up the files and get in the habit of feeding 
them each month as the paperwork rolls in mayer suggests you take 
a couple of hours now to sort through the piles of unorganized 
papers that have already built up this year 
the payoff i was able to prepare everything for my accountant 
in less than two hours he says mayer says organization comes in 
handy if the irs comes calling he should know since hes 
undergoing an irs audit 
mayer also thinks a good filing system is an antidote to tax 
anxiety everyone waits until the last minute to get anything 
done and they put a lot of pressure on themselves he says if 
people have everything organized they can get the stuff together 
in an hour and get it to their accountant or do it themselves and 
be finished with it

squeezing dependents 
congress has given parents another reason to suggest that grown 
children move out of the house until this year if a child was a 
fulltime student for at least five months of the year mom and dad 
could claim a dependency exemption as long as they provided more 
than half of the childs support it didnt matter how much junior 
made

now however the income test that applies to everyone else also 
covers fulltime students over age 23 if your son or daughter age 
24 or older has gross income of 2000 or more you cant claim him 
or her as a dependent regardless of how much support you provide 
that means no 2000 writeoff for you 
its not bad news for the whole family though since you cant 
claim the exemption your child can claim a personal exemption on 
his or her return

tax break lost 
congress has made a correction to the tax law that could 
prove costly if you take a hefty lumpsum distribution from a 
company retirement plan 
before 1987 retirees receiving such payouts could use a special 
taxsaving formula called 10year averaging to figure the tax bill 
congress replaced that with a less generous fiveyear averaging 
formula if you were born on or before jan 1 1936 you can still 
choose 10year averaging 
heres how fiveyear averaging works rather than tax your 
entire lumpsum distribution in your top tax bracket probably 28 
percent or 33 percent you find how much a single person would owe 
on a fifth of the payout if that was his or her only income then 
multiply that tax by five the benefit is that five times the 
normal amount is taxed in the 15 percent bracket rather than at 28 
percent that can save more than 12000 in some cases 
that saving is still possible on distributions up to 224500 
for bigger amounts however the benefit is gradually phased out 
until fiveyear averaging offers no advantage for payouts over 
465650 
the tax break disappears because congress has now decided the 5 
percent surcharge that creates the 33 percent bracket should also 
apply to fiveyear averaging if it wipes out the tax advantage for 
you consider 10year averaging if your age makes you eligible or 
take a hard look at an ira rollover advises changing times 
magazine 
putting the payout in an ira within 60 days of receiving the 
money puts off the tax bill until you withdraw the funds from the 
ira if you could spread the withdrawals over several years a 
rollover might be better for you even if the size of your 
distribution means youre not hurt by the change

as life expectancies lengthen and the number of people over 85 
doubles by the year 2000 more and more 40 and 50yearolds are 
going to be called upon to help their parents manage and protect 
their assets 
changing times magazine advises you to learn the medicaid 
shuffle and other maneuvers so youll be prepared should your 
parents become unable to take care of themselves 
with nursing home costs averaging 22000 a year about half the 
patients who foot the bill see their assets wiped out according to 
the health insurance association of america 
help may be available through medicaid the medical assistance 
program funded by federal and state governments but to be 
eligible an applicant must be virtually impoverished with cash 
and other nonexempt assets of as little as 2000 for an individual 
and 3000 for a couple in some states one big exception as long 
as one of your parents is living at home he or she cant be forced 
to sell it to pay for the others nursing home care nearly all 
other assets are fair game however 
last years medicare legislation introduced a new wrinkle in 
the past a spouse couldnt be forced to pay for more than a month 
of care of an institutionalized spouse applying for medicaid 
starting this year however the spouse at home can be required to 
dip into his or her assets 
heres how it works medicaid totals up the nonexempt assets of 
both husband and wife and each is given credit for half the 
spouse the wife say who stays at home can keep assets from her 
half worth up to 60000 anything over that is earmarked by 
medicaid to pay for her husbands care if the half comes to less 
than 12000 she gets enough of the total assets to reach the 
12000 minimum if possible the law also sets a ceiling usually 
1500 and a floor currently about 800 on her monthly income 
how can your parents protect their property their options are 
limited says changing times magazine setting up a trust wont 
work since transferred assets will be figured into the ability to 
pay for a parents care if the trustee has discretion to use the 
trusts income or principal for the parents benefit such a trust 
is called a medicaid qualifying trust 
your parents might be tempted to try an end run around the rules 
by giving their assets to you or selling them to you at a bargain 
price but that tactic wont elude uncle sam either under the new 
medicaid rules a parent can be ineligible for benefits for up to 
30 months following a transfer of property for less than fair 
market value to anyone other than a spouse 
of course your parents can outflank the government by 
transferring their property more than 30 months before one of them 
will be applying for medicaid however that assumes they can 
estimate when they might need assistance or have pockets deep 
enough to get through the waiting period

<TEXT>
your best strategy advises attorney myron greenberg of 
larkspur calif is to look for a good longtermcare insurance 
policy that pays for four years of nursing home care if your 
parent is still in the nursing home after 1 years assets can be 
transferred to you or to someone else the 30 months remaining on 
the policy will help cover the medicaid waiting period 
if you contribute to your parents financial support you may 
get your earthly reward in the form of tax breaks 
dependency exemption you will be able to claim your parent as 
a dependent if all of the following conditions apply you 
contribute more than half of his or her support your parent does 
not file a joint return and he or she has gross income of less 
than 2000 a year if you and other siblings together provide more 
than half the support any one of you but only one of you who 
supplies more than 10 percent can claim the exemption 
dependentcare tax credit if your elderly parent lives with 
you and you have to hire someone to care for him or her while you 
work you can get an income tax credit of as much as 720 to offset 
up to 2400 in expenses for one dependent and as much as 1440 to 
offset up to 4800 for two or more 
dependentcare reimbursement if your employer offers such a 
plan you can pay for up to 5000 a year in dependentcare 
expenses in pretax dollars it works like this you estimate your 
expenses for the coming year that amount is deducted from your 
salary and you dont pay taxes on it you then report your 
dependentcare expenses to your employer periodically and get 
reimbursed from the money that has been set aside one potential 
catch if any money remains in the account at the end of the year 
you lose it 
medicalcare deduction if your parent is your dependent or 
would be except that he or she files a joint return or has gross 
income of more than 2000 you can deduct medical expenses you pay 
on your parents behalf 
however medical expenses are deductible only to the extent they 
exceed 75 percent of adjusted gross income if its easier for 
your parents to meet that threshold than it is for you you might 
consider giving them the money to pay their own medical bills so 
they can take the deduction but be aware that if it exceeds 
10000 a year you will be making a taxable gift 
when you pay the money directly to a health care provider such 
as a nursing home theres an unlimited exclusion from the gift tax 
as long as the contribution is not reimbursed this would also 
avoid transferring assets to your parents that might be depleted by 
medicaid qualifying rules 
irrevocable trusts if you have assets to spare you can use 
some of them to set up an irrevocable trust that will provide 
income to your parents during their lifetimes or for a fixed 
period youll be contributing to their care with beforetax 
dollars and since you have given up control of the assets you 
wont be taxed on the income your parents will but those tax 
breaks dont come cheap neither you nor your spouse can get the 
assets back although the property can pass to your children at the 
end of the trust

do you have a plan of action in case one or both of your elderly 
parents cannot take care of themselves or their finances 
caring for your elderly parents can mean taking responsibility 
for their financial health as well as their physical wellbeing if 
you find yourself in that position youll have to negotiate a 
tricky legal and financial maze to determine among other things 
who should control your parents assets how they should be used 
and who if anyone will realize any tax benefits 
joint ownership of assets with right of survivorship is a 
popular strategy for parents and children but it is often not the 
best one holding a small bank account or two jointly with your 
parent makes sense if the amounts involved are relatively small 
or it can work when your parents finances are fairly 
straightforward if for example he or she doesnt own a home and 
receives income solely from social security and jointly held 
property bypasses probate 
as assets mount however so do the problems warns changing 
times magazine if your father for instance makes you a joint 
tenant generally he makes a gift to you that gift is subject to 
the federal gift tax when half the value of the assets exceeds 
10000 the annual exclusion from the gift tax depending on the 
asset you may owe income tax on half the income earned by the 
property even if your father keeps all of it for his own use 
you control the assets subject to the joint tenancy and you can 
do whatever you want with them your father thus has no guarantee 
youll use them on his behalf and when he dies you have no legal 
responsibility to share the assets with anyone else regardless of 
what your father may have wished 
two alternatives avoid those pitfalls the durable power of 
attorney and the revocable living trust 
durable power of attorney this technique is so crucial that a 
lawyer would be remiss in not suggesting that an older person have 
a durable power as well as a will says john regan of the hofstra 
university school of law who has written extensively on tax and 
estate planning for the elderly 
like a regular power of attorney a durable power is an 
inexpensive easily executed document it allows your father to 
name you or someone else as his agent and he can make the power 
as narrow or as broad as he wishes unlike a regular power of 
attorney which ceases when the person granting it becomes mentally 
incompetent a durable power remains in effect 
one catch to create a valid power a person has to be mentally 
competent at the time he or she signs it if your father already 
suffers from alzheimers disease or some other mental illness it 
may be too late you may have to ask the court to appoint a 
guardian for your father andor his property a procedure thats 
expensive degrading to the parent and may require doctors and 
family members to testify in open court

<TEXT>
so its critical to plan in advance but that too can raise a 
thorny issue a durable power takes effect as soon as it is signed 
which means you as agent have the power to manage the property 
immediately that may not sit well with a parent who is still fully 
capable of running his or her own affairs in that case consider a 
springing durable power of attorney if your parent lives in a 
state that permits it a springing durable power though executed 
now springs to life in the future normally when your parent 
becomes mentally unable to handle things 
even if a springing durable power isnt permitted in your state 
your mother can leave a signed durablepower document with her 
lawyer since you wont have proof in hand that you are the 
authorized agent you wont be able to do anything with her 
property should your mother become mentally incompetent the power 
would be turned over to you she can revoke a power of attorney at 
any time while she is still mentally competent 
all powers of attorney end automatically when the principal 
dies in a few states durable powers have to be renewed 
periodically 
a durable power is becoming the cornerstone of all estate 
planning for the elderly but it does have one possible drawback 
since your mother gives up control of her own affairs as soon as it 
takes effect you as agent may be able to do anything you want 
with your mothers property during her lifetime 
revocable living trusts if your mother prefers to retain more 
control over her affairs she might consider a revocable living 
trust such a trust takes effect during the lifetime of the person 
who sets it up who can change or revoke it as long as he or she is 
mentally competent it gives the creator a great deal of control 
during and after his or her lifetime usually your mother can 
continue to manage her property by acting as her own trustee with 
another trustee standing by to take over if she becomes 
incapacitated so the trust in effect operates like a springing 
durable power of attorney says changing times magazine 
perhaps even more important from your parents point of view 
trust language will spell out exactly how the trustee should use 
the income and principal if your mother doesnt want to transfer 
assets to the trust right away she can arrange for it to be done 
later by the trustee or another agent using a durable power of 
attorney at your parents death a trust can distribute property 
much like a will and the assets dont go through probate 
revocable living trusts have some drawbacks however in 
exchange for retaining control of his or her assets your parent 
does not get the tax breaks of an irrevocable trust which gives 
assets away permanently the creator of a revocable trust pays 
income tax on its earnings and at death the value of the assets is 
included in his or her gross estate for federal estatetax 
purposes drafting a trust also costs more than drafting a power of 
attorney lawyers fees run 300 to 400 or more you can figure on 
an additional 500 to 2500 a year if you choose a bank as 
trustee

theres a lot riding on the 1990 chevrolet lumina sedan 
as chevrolets newest model and its largest frontdrive car 
ever the lumina competes in the midsize family sedan market 
which accounts for a sizable 22 percent of total industry sales 
as the replacement for the chevrolet celebrity the lumina will 
hopefully live up to the celebritys record as americas 
bestselling midsize car for the past seven years combined and as 
the first sedan version of general motors corps 
multibilliondollar gm0 midsized cars the lumina is expected to 
help the giant automaker recoup its investment 
the test car a lumina euro sedan showed why growing families 
would appreciate this vehicle seating in front and back was 
respectable legroom in the rear was good with the front seats 
moved up and still adequate with the seats moved back a ways 
the engine a 31liter v6 thats standard with the euro model 
was teamed with a fourspeed automatic overdrive transmission fuel 
economy was decent for this size of car powered by a v6 engine 19 
milespergallon in the city and 30 mpg on the highway chevrolet 
attributes some of that performance to the cars aerodynamics 
the lumina sedan has a coefficient of drag of 32 which 
indicates the ease with which the car travels through the air and 
is better than the ford taurus cd of 33 but the engine works 
well too as the virginia state trooper commented when he ticketed 
me for going 84 mph on the interstate 
luminas handling and suspension with some rear suspension 
design borrowed from the corvette just made the car feel stable 
enough even at that high speed unfortunately for me 
during my travels i could readily hear the engines throaty 
rumble especially when i pressed the accelerator hard for quick 
maneuvers i also noted some road noise 
the dashboard gauges had large numbers and letters and were easy 
to read chevrolet designed the instrument cluster so it slanted 
downward and forward behind the clear plastic cover to help prevent 
glare 
on the outside the lumina euro sedans styling especially the 
rounded back reminded me somewhat of the pontiac bonneville 
compared with its predecessor the celebrity the lumina is two 
inches wider and offers 31 cubic feet of additional interior 
space trunk volume is down from 162 cubic feet in the celebrity 
to 157 cubic feet in the lumina still the luminas trunk was 
flat and spacious though you must lift items up and over the rear 
part of the car body 
the lumina started appearing in dealerships in the spring and 
chevrolet says its too early to tell how sales are going since the 
majority so far have gone to fleet buyers such as car rental 
agencies 
chevrolet projects 280000 sales of the lumina sedan by the end 
of the 1990 model with another 70000 sales of the lumina coupe 
the coupe will debut this fall as will a minivan carrying the 
lumina name but the timing for the lumina sedan may not be the 
best 
the ford taurus an imposing competitor has become entrenched 
as a popular midsize buy since its introduction in the 1986 model 
year and has a starting price of around 11700 just below the 
luminas 11883 
chevrolet is quick to note that the lumina offers some features 
as standard equipment that are optional on the taurus one example 
is the standard basecoat clearcoat paint finish on the lumina 
company officials said

jane wyatt came away from taping an 
appearance for a special father knows best marathon for 
fathers day surprised at just how good the sitcom was almost 30 
years ago 
we stopped filming in 1960 said wyatt its hard to 
believe we saw bits and pieces of shows when we taped the special 
they were quite good the show had substance thats why it lasted 
so long our shows were written to be entertaining but the writers 
had something to say 
wyatt and the rest of the cast will appear during the sevenhour 
father knows best marathon on the cbn family channel on sunday 
fathers day 
in its last season of original episodes 195960 father knows 
best ranked sixth in the nielsen ratings it has run on all three 
networks cbs first ran it in 1954 then nbc picked it up the 
second year then it returned to cbs until 196162 abc ran the 
series one last season 
robert young starred as jim anderson wyatt was margaret the 
children were elinor donahue as betty or princess billy gray 
as james jr better known as bud and lauren chapin as kathy 
kitten 
father knows best was the quintessential wholesome family 
sitcom along with the adventures of ozzie and harriet and 
the life of riley 
the show had begun in 1949 as a radio show with young in the 
lead role and june whitley as margaret when it was made into a 
television show wyatt was offered the role 
i turned it down time after time she recalled i said i 
didnt want to be in a tv serial i was in new york doing live 
television then my agent asked me to read a script i did and it 
was charming then when i began the first year we used the radio 
scripts they concentrated on bud and i was just standing around 
doing nothing i was used to being a busy actress but when they 
began writing new scripts we all had a lot to do 
she said she gives a lot of credit for the shows success to 
eugene rodney who was youngs partner in ownership of the series 
he ran it just like a broadway show she said it was his 
whole life we were called miss wyatt and mr young not a word 
of a script could be changed every line was written for a specific 
character each characters personality was so welldefined you 
couldnt give someones line to another character and all 39 
scripts were written in advance 
each script always solved a little problem that was universal 
it appealed to everyone i think the world is hankering for a 
family people may want to be free but they still want a nuclear 
family 
a new generation probably knows wyatt for her role as mr 
spocks mother on star trek she appeared in the original tv 
series on nbc and in the fourth star trek movie 
before father knows best wyatt starred in such movies as 
the 1937 version of lost horizon gentlemans agreement and 
task force shes been busy most recently with series guest 
shots and tv movies and shes currently appearing in the 
theatrical film amityville the horror goes on 
but wyatt is still famous as margaret anderson on mothers day 
she went to tampa fla for a joint appearance with two other tv 
moms barbara billingsley of leave it to beaver and florence 
henderson of the brady bunch 
wyatt said there is talk of doing a spinoff of father knows 
best with elinor donahue as the mother wyatt and young would 
make occasional appearances as the grandparents 
the cbn family channel will present seven episodes from the 
original series second honeymoon betty girl engineer 
bud the willing worker kathys big chance a medal for 
margaret short wave and father of the year 
i cant get over the interest people still have in the show 
said wyatt when we did it we had no idea it would make such a 
big splash i went to peru on a botanical trip last year the 
stewardesses on the plane were all over us in lima we were 
besieged by people the shows called papa lo sabe todo there

h bradley martin was born to money well 
educated discriminating loved books and lived a long time 
qualities that made him one of the great book collectors of the 
20th century 
when he died last year at age 82 his library included more than 
10000 books and manuscripts all of which he kept in his new york 
apartment and at rose hill his handsome georgian house in virginia 
i suppose we were one of the few families to consider the care 
and cleaning of books a favorite activity says his wife 
jacqueline martin we loved working together and we rejoiced 
with him in each new edition 
sixtyfour years after the 18yearold martin purchased his 
first rare book a copy of tom sawyer at a shop on 14th 
street in manhattan his collection will be sold at auction by 
sothebys the series of eight sales will start june 6 and continue 
through the next year they are expected to fetch more than 30 
million 
a copy of naturalist john james audubons masterwork birds of 
america is expected to bring 2 million to 3 million edgar 
allen poes first edition copy of eureka with his own 
annotations is estimated at 100000 to 150000 while a 
watercolor of a woodchat bird is listed at 400 to 600 
the quality of the sale is so high said selby kiffer an 
assistant vice president at sothebys that nonbook collectors 
including people who want only the best for their homes are 
expected to join the bookish set in tendering bids 
the first sale to run june 6june 8 will focus on martins 
ornithological collection considered by experts to be the best in 
private hands his collections of american english and french 
literature childrens books americana and natural history books 
will be sold later on 
he had lots of the ingredients one needs to have to form a 
great collection said david n redden a senior vice president 
at the auction house he had wealth he had a good education he 
had an interest in his collecting area starting at a very early 
age and he had great taste and discrimination put all those 
together and you end up with potential for a great collection 
martin was the oldest of five sons of bradley martin and helen 
phipps and the grandson of henry phipps a partner of andrew 
carnegie he lived a privileged life attending oxford as an 
undergraduate and serving as a director of the trust companies that 
managed the family fortune originally made from steel interests 
book collecting was his passion during world war ii he had 
proof sheets for one sale catalog sent to him while serving with 
the office of strategic services in north africa 
friends and associates describe him as a gentleman in the old 
school polite quiet modest handsome and an interesting 
conversationalist he was also admired as a meticulous collector 
ive been in this business 78 years my first sale was in 
1912 said bookseller david kirschenbaum of carnegie bookshop in 
manhattan a lifelong friend of martins there are people who 
are accumulators and there are people that are collectors this is 
a collection 
a collector has a reason for every book that he buys an 
accumulator just buys this thing or the other 
martin also gets high marks among book lovers for being a 
prolific reader as well as a collector of books but he spent much 
of his time reading catalogs produced by booksellers and auction 
houses 
one of martins favorite acquisitions was audubons fivevolume 
folio of 435 handcolored etched plates of 489 supposed species 
including the trumpeter swan the roseate spoonbill and the snowy 
owl he bought it through the carnegie bookshop in 1956 a special 
cabinet designed for the folio was the focal point of martins 
sitting room in new york 
other highlights of the collection include his copy of the 
federalist which was presented to george washington by alexander 
hamilton the twovolume book estimated at 250000 to 400000 
has washingtons signature and book plate and annotations by james 
madison 
when i picked up the federalist papers which had been on 
deposit at the morgan library it was a little nerveracking 
said kiffer who is cataloging the books it was one of the few 
times my hands were shaking 
martins copy of the declaration of independence which is one 
of 23 copies known to survive from the original printing of 100 is 
expected to fetch 400000 to 600000 he acquired it in the 1970s 
from a new york city bookseller 
there is tremendous interest in this there is every 
indication that the high estimate will be exceeded kiffer said 
there is general concern that this copy might leave the country 
martin carefully assembled his library over 64 years the 
sothebys sale will dismantle it in one year 
but kirschenbaum who lunched with martin three times a week 
said martin would be happy about the auction mrs martin is 
because the sale will give other collectors a chance to fill out 
their own libraries as her husband did

years ago doctors counted pills into white 
envelopes for patients today a new industry is taking over that 
role promising practice building and revenue enhancement 
to doctors who sell the prescriptions they write in a continuing 
series the business of medicine science writer daniel q 
haney and national writer fred bayles look at the drug repackaging 
industry 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soft click and hum of pillcounting 
machines give a hightech tone to the operations of the 
pharmaceutical corporation of america but the heart of the 
business is simplicity itself moving medicine from big bottles 
into little bottles 
in the companys brightly lit airfiltered filling room women 
in surgical garb stuff in cotton screw on tops and paste on 
labels readying stacks of machinefilled plastic containers for 
resale in clinics and doctors offices around the country 
despite its small size just 12 employees pca is a big player 
in a new industry called repackaging a business that is helping 
physicians remold themselves from professionals into entrepreneurs 
and in the process prompting ethical questions and calls by 
legislators for tighter regulation of doctors 
repackaging houses are mass production versions of the local 
drug store instead of one pharmacist counting out pills to fill 
one prescription the repackagers buy antibiotics decongestants 
and other drugs from manufacturers in large lots then break them 
down into bottles that can be resold to individual patients these 
are sealed labeled and shipped to doctors who add 2 to 4 per 
prescription to the wholesale cost 
an estimated 8 percent of the nations 330000 officebased 
doctors have become retailers of repackaged medicines 
the repackagers are trying to remake the role of the doctor as 
a patient advocate into something else in effect making the 
physician a vendor said rep ron wyden dore who has 
sponsored legislation to prohibit doctors from selling 
prescriptions for profit 
there is a growing number of fastbuck artists who are telling 
doctors they can make 50000 without any more difficulty than 
reaching for a prescription pad 
repackagers say they only are responding to an increasingly 
competitive medical profession where anything that brings in 
additional patients and income to a practice might make the 
difference between success or failure 
the industry developed because there was an opportunity 
said dr mason goodman a lung specialist who is also chief 
executive officer at pca all of the changes in the marketplace 
made physicians more receptive to this than they would have been 10 
years ago 
indeed 10 years ago the repackaging industry was just getting 
started but it has grown fast 
market analyst joy twiss thompson of marshall amp co of atlanta 
predicts 10 percent of the 20 billion annual prescription drug 
market will move from the pharmacy to the doctors office over the 
next seven years she estimates repackagers revenues will climb 
from 25 million in 1986 to more than 75 million this year 
when i survey doctors and nurses to see their attitudes i 
could probably sell 10 to 15 accounts in an average day she 
said they have been waiting for a dispensing company the 
repackagers have not had the ability to get out and meet the 
demand 
critics say the demand was created in part by hardsell 
brochures and medical journal ads that promised doctors up to 
50000 a year in additional income one ad no longer used by pca 
talked of 15000 to 30000 with no additional work 
much of the advertising has cooled partly in response to 
criticism the repackagers now emphasize physician dispensing as a 
convenience to patients and a way to build a practice 
its not a huge money maker but its a great practice 
enhancement tool said goodman of pca the first law in 
medicine is not to erode your patient population you want to grow 
it 
steven geringer executive vice president of the nashvillebased 
clinical pharmaceuticals inc puts profits from drug sales at 
8000 to 10000 annually for the average doctor 
many repackagers say their business strategy was and in many 
cases still is aimed at clinics ambulatory care centers and 
large group practices smaller physicians offices they say dont 
do the volume of drug sales the repackagers need to make a profit 
this is a business of low margin with high selling costs 
said charles hampton chairman and president of allscrips 
pharmaceuticals inc of vernon hills ill about half our 
business by number are groups under five but in terms of volume 
they probably account for less than a third of our sales 
allscrips is a good example of how the repackaging industry 
began and grew founded three years ago by hampton a former drug 
company executive and funded with venture capital from allstate 
insurance co and several other groups the company is approaching 
20 million in annual revenues 
we got into it because there were a lot of things happening in 
the market hampton said there was the growth of the urgent 
care centers and the large group practices where they were 
traditionally dispensing out of envelopes there was a change in 
the industry in general 
but this change has brought calls for tighter regulation of 
dispensing doctors 
while the repackagers are regulated as drug companies under 
federal and state law a recent study by the us department of 
health and human services inspector generals office found less 
governmental scrutiny of drug selling doctors than of pharmacists 
we felt there should be some of the same procedural 
requirements that exist for pharmacists such as recordkeeping 
supervision and labeling said martha kvaal a deputy regional 
inspector general who headed the study 
kvaal also noted some 15 states reported taking disciplinary 
action against physicians for dispensing abuses since 1986 often 
it was for procedural errors such as improper labeling of 
medication but there also have been cases of overprescribing by 
physicians who make money from drug sales 
such concerns led rep wyden to file a bill last year to ban 
doctors from selling drugs for profit the bill which failed to 
make it to a house vote was strongly opposed by repackagers who 
formed the competitive health care coalition and hired washington 
lobbyists and public relation consultants to fight the bill 
geringer who headed the coalition said the bill would have 
killed his industry even though it would still allow physicians to 
dispense drugs at cost 
if there werent any profit in it the doctors wouldnt do 
it geringer said 
the repackagers have found an ally in the federal government 
the federal trade commissions bureau of competition has endorsed 
physician dispensing and even advised maryland and georgia against 
overregulation 
the two states are among some 20 that over the past three years 
have tightened regulations on doctors who sell drugs 
the repackaging industry is likely to flourish the new medicare 
catastrophic coverage act allows doctors to be reimbursed by the 
government for drugs they sell to elderly patients and repackagers 
are lobbying insurers to include doctors in their drug coverage 
analysts like thompson even see repackagers branching into other 
products to market through physicians offices weight loss 
programs that include diet food behavior modification tapes and 
other materials 
geringer see nothing wrong with using doctors offices as retail 
outlets 
if a client is sitting out there you want to think of other 
things you can sell them he said thats true of any 
business

move over donald trump step aside frank lorenzo lex luthor 
the cunning comicbook villain and archenemy of superman is in the 
hostile takeover business and pillaging the bluechip pickings of 
metropolis 
lately the baldheaded billionaire bad guy has schemed to acquire 
scientific and technological advanced research laboratories a 
rival to his lexcorp group 
yes the folks at dc comics inc magazines have discovered a 
theme already milked by the hollywood producers of wall street 
and working girl corporate takeovers and foxy financiers make 
good entertainment 
the april and may issues of superman and the adventures of 
superman featured lex luthors hostile takeover some 
reallife professionals call it an intricate and accurate portrayal 
of big business at its greediest 
with superman off in outer space for soulsearching meditation 
during these episodes the companies of metropolis many already 
have been acquired by lexcorp subsidiaries are defenseless 
against further luthor raids 
but wait before going further some explanation four years 
ago superman and the regular characters in his exploits were 
retooled for the 1980s and beyond 
luthor for instance went from crafty criminal scientist bent 
on world destruction to conniving corporate genius desiring world 
domination capital and calculators are as important to todays 
luthor as robots and ray guns were to his predecessor but superman 
remains his nemesis 
to most people on the street lex luthor isnt a bad guy hes 
the guy who signs their pay checks writer roger stern said in a 
telephone interview from ithaca new york the old luthor could 
make a death ray out of an aspirin and an alarm clock but this 
luthor is really scary hes really amoral 
so with the man of steel temporarily out of the picture luthor 
is plotting stern gives him a challenge on scale with the massive 
mergers and acquisitions that dominate newspaper business pages 
part one a peek into a meeting of lexcorp directors reveals a 
discussion of takeover targets luthor nixes them a glance out the 
window at the building across the street reveals his target 
star labs 
the reader finds later that luthor doesnt want the whole 
company just its brainresearching psionics lab part of his 
obsession with obtaining technology to destroy superman 
part two luthor lets it slip that hes interested in star 
rumors rock the market the price of star stock spirals 
company division heads meet angry that they havent been told of a 
possible takeover stars chief executive officer tries to calm 
them its just rumors but lexcorp would be a good parent for 
star he says 
division heads disagree many threaten to quit if luthor gains 
control the mere possibility of luthor at the helm prompts five 
star researchers to take early retirement 
its realistic and plausible said tony viscogliosi a 
securities research analyst at roney amp co a detroit investment 
concern when you do an acquisition in a research lab it cant 
be a hostile takeover its assets are its people if they walk 
youve got nothing its similar to what might happen in the 
takeover of a pharmaceutical company like upjohn 
part three as speculative buying of its stock continues 
star decides to fight luthor by lobbing a poison pill 
defense at him it issues thousands of shares of new stock that 
will make a takeover more difficult 
star sells its psionics unit to raise cash unwittingly to 
a dummy corporation controlled by luthor while searching in vain 
for a friendly white knight buyer for the rest of the company 
part four luthor announces he no longer is interested in 
star the stock price plummets star is ruined luthor walks 
away the psionics lab in his possession through his shell company 
hes made millions by riding up the price of the star stock he 
owned then later dumped 
i dont think it was very far off the mark if you take the 
comicbookness out of it viscogliosi said 
he said luthor played to the news media throughout the series 
with the deft touch of trump the billionaire property mogul the 
star employees distaste at working for luthor reminded him of 
the antagonism that striking eastern airline employees have 
expressed for their boss lorenzo 
whats important in the market is not who acquires the shares 
its who controls them viscogliosi said in one story this 
brought up all the relevant ethical and moral issues that are faced 
by all the interested parties in one of these deals 
while viscogliosi found few faults with sterns tale he said 
the securities and exchange commission likely would have sued 
luthor for stock manipulation 
the possibility of sec investigators going after him was hinted 
in the comic tale but luthor dismissed it saying the only 
people who might tell them do not dare

in the new world according to president bush the 
west has won the cold war even though it isnt over yet 
time and again bush has told the soviet union that it is the 
losing side that theme accompanies and helps to explain his drive 
for us policy that looks beyond containment of the soviets 
after summoning the atlantic allies to join in an effort to 
redraw the military map of europe with sharp eastwest cuts in 
conventional weapons bush urged that the political map be redrawn 
too 
and on western terms 
he wants to erase lines that carved europe apart after world war 
ii he promises to carry that quest beyond the rusting iron 
curtain when he goes to poland and hungary next month 
the cold war began with the division of europe bush said in 
mainz west germany on wednesday it can only end when europe is 
whole 
and bush sees that coming with the liberating power of 
democracy already at work in eastern europe he said the west and 
its values have succeeded while in the communist world their 
vision failed 
the words arent as harsh as the ones ronald reagan once used 
consigning the soviets to the ash heap of history denouncing their 
evil empire bush calls them losers citing their political and 
economic performance as evidence 
winds of change are blowing in eastern europe including the 
soviet union bush said in a dinner toast at a west german 
castle it is happening in part because mr gorbachev has seen 
that our society works and that his does not 
the president has said repeatedly that he wants the reforms of 
mikhail s gorbachev to succeed 
secretary of state james a baker iii said that is the 
administrations hope because what he is doing is embracing the 
political and economic agenda of the west 
the west has won baker said weve won the struggle of 
the past 40 years the soviet union is moving in our direction 
and we ought to continue to encourage their moving in our 
direction 
constant reminders of soviet failures have to be grating in 
moscow 
bushs words are in a way further rebuttals 33 years later 
to nikita s khrushchevs claim that history is on our side 
we will bury you 
the situation is favorable for us khrushchev said in 1956 
if god existed we would thank him for this 
those taunts echoed for years in us foreign policy debates 
there are no such menacing words from bush but what hes saying 
may have a political echo inside the soviet union with opponents 
of the gorbachev course 
then again bush also has a hardline conservative bloc to 
handle at home his emphasis on the momentum for freedom as 
western political and economic ideas move eastward will soften 
conservative opposition to his arms control ideas 
as president i will continue to do all i can to help open the 
closed societies of the east bush said in mainz we seek 
selfdetermination for all of germany and all of eastern europe 
and we will not relax and we must not waver 
well aware of his own conservative constituency bush and his 
aides were careful to note that they are not doing gorbachev any 
favors with the newlook arms control offer 
this proposal is very very good for the united states 
baker said thats why he has suggested it its not something 
were doing for the soviet union 
but no deal flies if it does not have benefits for both sides 
bush pointed out more than once that by accepting his offer 
gorbachev could save defense dollars and ease his own economic 
problems 
for good measure bush and baker both have dared gorbachev to do 
some more unilateral arms cutting to offer deeds to match words 
prudence and realism will be the standards which will guide 
this relationship the secretary of state said the fact that 
the president has put a bold proposal on the table doesnt mean 
that he has abandoned prudence and realism 
bush and his high command know at first hand the political peril 
that can come from the republican right they worked for president 
gerald r ford during an earlier cycle of thaw followed by soviet 
buildup during a 1976 campaign in which pressure from reagans 
republican right forced the word detente out of the 
administration vocabulary 
the president also sought to reassure the soviets that he does 
not seek to undermine their legitimate security interests our 
goal is to convince them step by step that their definition of 
security is obsolete that their deepest fears are unfounded 
that is an ambitious undertaking since world war ii ended the 
soviet concept of security has been founded on a communist zone in 
central and eastern europe russian suspicion of the west has 
historic roots that go deeper than communism

advertising agency and network officials say 
they are encouraged by an effort by the leading national tv ratings 
company to develop a system that measures who watches television by 
recognizing viewers faces 
they said they agreed with the sponsors assessment that the 
passive measurement system would provide a more accurate reading of 
tv audiences than existing systems that require viewers to push 
buttons or write down what they have watched 
the passive system would use a cameralike recorder programmed 
to recognize faces and to note electronically when specific members 
of a family watch tv 
nielsen media research the dun amp bradstreet corp unit that 
compiles national tv ratings announced wednesday that it had 
reached an agreement with the david sarnoff research center of 
princeton nj to jointly develop the passive tvviewing 
measurement system 
the system could have potentially widereaching effects on a 
medium that carried nearly 25 billion in advertising last year 
it is being developed as advertisers are demanding more proof 
and media outlets such as the tv networks are under more pressure 
to show that advertising is reaching its intended targets ratings 
are used to help set prices for commercial time 
we support their effort 110 percent said richard kostyra 
director of media services for the ad agency j walter thompson 
he said the passive system brings researchers closer to 
measuring actually what is happening rather than relying on a 
survey groups cooperation in pushing buttons or writing down what 
they watched 
nielsen has been measuring national tv audiences with a people 
meter system since 1987 that automatically records the channel a 
set is tuned to while relying on those watching to punch in when 
they start watching tv and punch out when they leave 
for local ratings nielsen has people note in diaries what shows 
each member of the family watched during a given period 
advertisers and the television networks long have complained 
that systems requiring viewers to do something while they are 
watching tv may distort estimates of who is watching specific shows 
john a dimling a top marketing executive for nielsen said a 
passive system should yield even higher quality more accurate 
data because the respondents dont have to do anything other than 
be themselves 
dimling said the passive system could eliminate the problem of 
people who simply grow weary of pushing a button each time they 
start or quit watching tv 
the networks have argued that children for instance often fail 
to punch the people meter buttons and say the ratings therefore 
understate the audience for childrens programming 
bill reubens who as an nbc research executive was very critical 
of the introduction of people meters said the passive meter system 
would be a major step forward 
i think everybody felt the people meter was an intermediate 
step said reubens who retired from nbc at the end of 1988 but 
continues to do consulting on ratings methodology for nbc cbs and 
abc 
dimling said the passive system could also someday be used to 
measure who is watching individual commercials as well as shows 
nielsen selected the sarnoff research center as its partner in 
the passive meter project because of the centers extensive work in 
image recognition 
sarnoff formerly the research arm of rca corp but now calls 
its image recognition approach smartsensing and would use it 
in connection with tv audience measurement to recognize the faces 
of those watching television 
the sensory equipment could be packaged to resemble a 
videocassette recorder and placed on top of the television set it 
would electronically record the names of those it recognizes and 
the periods during which they watched television strangers would 
be listed simply as visitors 
asked whether the system is too big brotherish dimling 
said i dont think we are talking about big brother here at 
all 
he said the system would not film or otherwise record anything 
that goes on in the room other than the names of those watching tv 
and he noted the equipment would be installed only in homes where 
families agree to it

the caribbean tourism industry continues to be 
pinched by the 3monthold strike against eastern airlines with 
business slashed at some hotels and air fares in the region 
soaring some travel industry executives say 
it makes a tremendous difference its a major concern to 
us john bell executive vice president of the caribbean hotel 
association said in an interview wednesday 
bell said some hotels in the popular resort region had lost as 
much as 40 percent of their business this season due to the strike 
by machinists union members pilots and flight attendants against 
miamibased eastern which began march 4 and sharply curtailed the 
airlines operations 
the losses were greatest in the bahamas and puerto rico said 
bell whose association represents 740 hotels in 31 caribbean 
countries 
eastern has reduced its caribbean operations to flights to the 
bahamas puerto rico and haiti compared with its prestrike 
schedule of about a dozen caribbean destinations 
the president of one large tour operator that sought bankruptcy 
protection from creditors due to the impact of the eastern walkout 
said discount fares to the caribbean now cost substantially more 
than last year and are less available 
joseph garzilli president of flyfaire inc considered one of 
the biggest us tour operators specializing in caribbean vacation 
packages said the cheapest roundtrip fare between new york and 
san juan puerto rico was 249 on american airlines compared with 
174 last year on eastern 
there have been some great voids in the marketplace said 
garzilli whose hawthorne nybased business sought protection 
from creditors on march 13 four days after eastern did so 
garzilli said the retreat of eastern which had been the leader 
in discount fares to the caribbean means cheaper fares are 
slowly slipping away 
some competitors such as american and easterns sister carrier 
continental airlines have increased their flights in the region 
since the eastern strike 
flyfaire which had used eastern flights as the basis for about 
70 percent of its tour packages says eastern owes it about 15 
million garzilli said however that flyfaire has continued 
operating under bankruptcy protection and doesnt plan to sever its 
relationship with eastern if the airline returns to the caribbean 
bell spoke earlier at a news conference announcing a new program 
by which travel agents dealing with flyfaire would make payments to 
caribbean hotels mark mackenzie a senior director of citicorp 
services inc in chicago said the eastern situation had aggravated 
the longstanding problem of hotel payment delays in the region 
eastern stopped paying creditors including tour operators 
after it sought bankruptcy court protection that in turn delayed 
or dried up payments by those businesses to hotels 
under the new hotel payment program all payments to caribbean 
hotels from flyfaire vacation packages will be processed through 
citicorps world travel payment system citicorp will receive 
payments from travel agents and send them directly to hotels 
traditionally payments to hotels in the caribbean pass through 
airlines or tour operators often causing delays of up to four 
months industry executives say 
if the new system had been in place before the eastern strike 
flyfaire wouldnt have been forced into a bankruptcy proceeding 
garzilli said because the tour operator wouldnt have had to rely 
on payments from eastern to pass on to hotels 
other caribbean tour operators are expected to join flyfaire in 
the program citicorps mackenzie said 
eastern management plans to rebuild eastern into a smaller 
carrier and sell about 18 billion of its assets some financial 
analysts and other observers believe the carrier might sell its 
caribbean routes under the plan 
the eastern plan still must be approved by the federal 
bankruptcy court in new york

corporate television growing faster than 
cable commercial and public broadcasting is still in its infancy 
but its a mighty healthy 6 billion baby 
the industry boosted by the vcr boom and satellite technology 
celebrated its roots and its future wednesday at the annual meeting 
of the international television association which represents tv 
producers 
in the 1980s television has become an integral part of 
corporate culture said len magsamen president of itva which 
was born in san francisco 21 years ago and has helped spur the 
corporate tv industry to a 20 percent annual growth rate 
the vast majority of fortune 500 companies are already using 
video and the demand for it will not subside he said all our 
indicators show demand is going through the roof 
businesses are using video live or on tape in several ways to 
communicate quickly with their employees and management around the 
country or overseas to introduce products and promote them to 
clients to market directly to customers at home and to train 
workers 
with videocassette recorders in nearly 60 percent of american 
homes corporations are finding video an effective marketing tool 
said carl levine director of corporate television services at 
unitel video inc in new york which provides video production 
facilities to companies 
the home vcr market is a fourth tv network said levine 
the rapid growth of the home vcr market which is peaking now 
has created a distribution medium for corporatesponsored programs 
to go into homes look for that in the 1990s as being a very large 
growth area 
he cited such tapes as a camera companys instructional video on 
how to take pictures with a catalog of accessories at the end a 
power tool companys home improvement video featuring its products 
sports illustrateds swimsuit issue and financial programs 
designed for seniors young married couples or other groups 
corporations can target a specific audience produce a program 
and through their mailing lists or instore promotions reach 
their audience on a costefficient basis levine said 
the biggest change the business television industry has seen 
over the last few years magsamen said has been the increasing 
number of independent companies or individuals who are hired by 
corporations for production editing writing taping and other 
jobs 
corporations need the same production values that viewers have 
grown accustomed to when they watch broadcast cable or home video 
programming levine said 
but many large corporations such as american telephone amp 
telegraph co gte corp federal express corp and hewlettpackard 
co maintain their own video departments 
our chairman considers video a critical tool to communicate 
said linda evans manager of atampts corporate television operation 
in basking ridge nj it allows us to put a human face on 
business as we grow in our satellite network it allows us to kill 
rumors quickly on critical matters we prefer to have employees 
hear about things from us than read about it in the newspaper 
evans oversees a dozen producers plus two dozen engineers 
editors and other staffers cameramen are hired on a freelance 
basis 
we do about 200 programs each year mostly informational but 
they are increasingly productoriented for sales she said the 
company has its own satellite tv network with 150 downlink sites 
around the country 
to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the new atampt the 
company used 27 crews to produce a program called all in a days 
work which premiered to employees in january on the satellite 
network and was released on tape it also was shown to shareholders 
at the annual meeting and was used by an advertising company to 
create three commercials for network television 
that saved the company about 7 million of advertising 
evans said the program has paid for itself many times over 
business television will continue to outpace other segments of 
the tv industry levine predicted 
broadcast television has been cutting back in recent years 
offering many employees early retirement packages and the cable 
industry has never turned into the form of original programming 
people expected he said 
if you look at the independent market especially outside 
hollywood or new york the largest portion of their business is for 
the corporate sector more than 2000 video producers are 
attending the convention itva has 9000 us members and 3500 in 
14 other countries

when an advertisement for tropicana orange juice 
showed olympic decathlon winner bruce jenner squeezing oranges into 
a carton the message was that tropicana unlike other brands is 
not made from concentrate 
but the cocacola co maker of rival minute maid complained 
and a court eventually said the ad was false because tropicana 
juice is not in fact squeezed directly from oranges into the 
carton it is pasteurized and usually frozen first 
with that decision tropicana products inc became one of a long 
list of companies to learn the hard way that a major comparative ad 
campaign that does not elicit a lawsuit is a rare creature 
until the 1970s television networks prevented advertisers from 
mentioning comparable products by name forcing them to mumble 
politely about brand x 
since then however the noholdsbarred approach to advertising 
has proliferated and so have lawsuits 
every competitive advertiser should be ready to go to court 
marketing experts bruce buchanan and doron goldman warned in the 
mayjune issue of the harvard business review once your 
competitor files suit you can do little to stop the process 
congress may have accelerated the lawsuits last year by 
strengthening the fair advertising laws in addition companies 
that suffer real or imagined slights by competitors have grown 
testy and are now quick to shoot back in court 
even if they lose they figure they may dissuade someone else 
from trying the same thing 
under the trademark law revision act of 1988 anyone who 
misrepresents his or her or another persons goods or services 
is liable for damages 
that wording closed a loophole in the 43yearold lanham act 
which prohibited false claims about ones own products but did not 
mention another persons 
buchanan and goldman who are researchers at new york 
universitys stern school of business say it is too early to tell 
whether the tougher law will lead to a rash of lawsuits 
but they maintain there was no shortage of such actions under 
the old law they counted more than 60 judicial decisions in 
comparative advertising cases half of them in the last four years 
even that number is conservative they say because many more 
cases probably were settled out of court 
we have no absolute figures but the activity in the courts 
certainly seems to be increasing buchanan said in an interview 
wednesday 
in many cases a successful suit leads only to an injunction 
banning the offending ads from the airwaves or print media but if 
the plaintiff can show harm the stakes can be higher 
when jartran inc ran ads touting its rental trucks for 
example it put uhaul internationals competing trucks in the 
background so they looked small and unattractive the ploy 
backfired when a court ruled the ads were deliberately false 
and ordered jartran to pay uhaul 40 million in compensatory and 
punitive damages 
but even claims that appear largely truthful have been 
challenged successfully 
rj reynolds tobacco co for example got in trouble when it 
said its now cigarettes had the lowest tar of all brands on the 
market with only 2 milligrams of tar apiece 
that may have been true for comparable kingsize brands but 
carlton 70 a shorter brand had only 1 milligram its maker 
american brands inc went to court and won 
despite the pitfalls advertising agencies like ogilvy amp mather 
say comparative ads are more popular than ever with manufacturers 
of pain relievers pickup trucks and soft drinks constantly going 
headtohead 
you have to be very very sure of your claims said mary 
mcelyea a spokeswoman for chevrolet trucks which has been 
pounding ford motor co trucks in comparative ads since late 1987 
but if youre careful it can be very effective the name of 
the game is cut through the clutter and make it clear to the 
customer why your product is better

president carlos salinas gortaris national 
development plan for 19891994 promises the modernization and 
economic recovery that have been his themes since he was a 
candidate 
change in our politics economy and society is 
indispensable salinas said wednesday as he unveiled the program 
for his sixyear term at a ceremony at the national palace 
he has been saying much the same thing since he was a candidate 
last year 
but six months into his presidency salinas now speaks with the 
authority of some solid progress on one of mexicos most pressing 
problems its 1074 billion foreign debt 
salinas has liberalized the rules on foreign investment kept 
inflation under control continued to sell stateowned industries 
cracked down on union and stock market corruption and eased 
mexicos dependence on oil 
creditors have reacted favorably 
the club of paris the name given mexicos 16 primary creditor 
nations agreed this week to cut the debt by 26 billion and 
refinance 80 percent of the interest over the next decade the 
international monetary fund last week approved a credit line of 
41 billion 40 percent of which can be used for the debt 
debt payments which totalled 16 billion last year and were 
expected to be even higher this year are consuming resources that 
salinas wants to use for development 
progress on the debt the secondlargest in the developing 
world is critical to the 41yearold presidents goal of presiding 
over a steady and impressive economic growth rate of 6 percent 
a year 
salinas warned that such a dramatic turnaround in the economy 
and the other reforms he has promised will require effort on many 
fronts from virtually every segment of mexican society 
mexicos problems he warned go deeper than the debt 
lets not fall into thinking that once this obstacle has been 
overcome we will have resolved all our problems he said 
mexico which has been ruled by the same political party for 60 
years has a long history of protectionism and official paternalism 
that permitted steady growth from the 1940s through the 1970s but 
fostered an industry and work force that are inefficient and 
dependent on government subsidies 
all that must change salinas said stressing the importance of 
developing a productive work force capable of competing in 
international markets 
a closed and inefficient economy is incapable of satisfying 
the needs of the population said salinas 
among those needs are the creation of 1 million new jobs a year 
and the construction of at least 300000 new homes he said 
the people demand food education housing health services 
security and a clean environment in short personal and family 
progress on their horizon 
although his 164page blueprint proposes the modernization of 
the nation in all its aspects the focus is clearly economics 
mexicos economic crisis began when the bottom fell out of the 
oil market in 1982 after several boom years of heavy borrowing 
inflation began spiraling upward reaching a record 1597 percent 
in 1987 and the buying power of the average worker eroded to half 
the preboom levels 
salinas a harvardeducated economist tried to engineer 
economic stability and modernization since the early 1980s when he 
was a deputy treasury secretary and later budget secretary under 
former president miguel de la madrid

a congressional report warns of danger to 2 
million american jobs and 75 billion worth of us exports because 
of the efforts by west european countries to eliminate internal 
trade barriers by 1992 
the plans of the european community are sometimes called 
ec92 a congressional subcommittee has been holding hearings 
on their effect 
witness after witness 21 in all argued that despite many 
benefits of ec92 to us business key aspects were already 
reducing and would continue to reduce american exports to the ec 
and us jobs in critical sectors of the economy rep sam 
gejdenson dconn said wednesday 
gejdenson chairs the subcommittee on international economic 
policy of the house foreign affairs committee the subcommittee 
approved the report without dissent but only three of the 13 
members attended the session 
gejdenson singled out the process by which the european 
governments are setting standards for their industries he said the 
europeans do not let outside observers take part in the process 
while us standardsetting is open 
he said he had not heard of the agreement announced earlier 
wednesday to resume talks on standards this summer the commerce 
department said us products would get the same access to testing 
and certification procedures as european products ella krucoff 
press officer for the ec delegation in washington said that did 
not mean american firms except those with subsidiaries in europe 
could take part in setting the standards 
gejdenson also complained that 
european rules require that some imported products such as 
auto parts and electronic equipment be manufactured partially 
within the 12 member countries 
though many of the policies requiring a high level of european 
content in products assembled in the ec are aimed at japan the 
effects of these policies are already being felt by the us 
electronics industry he said 
in some cases american companies will not be treated the same 
way as ec companies after 1992 this would likely result in a 
continuing us inability to win bids for contracts in the 600 
billion per year ec government procurement market gejdenson said 
the subcommittee recommended 
that the bush administration adopt a more aggressive strategy 
instead of reacting to european decisions 
that a firm timetable be set for negotiations with the ec 
unless difficulties are settled in the 96government uruguay 
round of trade talks 
the united states press for observer status at sessions where 
european industry standards are set 
an increase in the staffing level of the us mission to the ec 
in brussels and of groups analyzing ec decisions 
while taking a hard line on protectionist ec92 policies may 
cause friction in the short run such actions will improve 
longterm usec trade relations gejdenson predicted

in the latest shock wave to hit the aerospace 
industry from pentagon budgettightening hughes aircraft co 
announced it would lay off 6000 workers over the next six months 
the layoffs announced wednesday which amount to 8 percent of 
hughes workforce follow smaller reductions at northrop corp and 
grumman corp analysts predict the bush administrations 
tightfisted approach to defense spending will bring further 
layoffs and cut into profits in the aerospace industry 
it presumably is the first blast of winter in the defense 
environment but i dont think it will be the last said wolfgang 
demisch who follows the industry for ubs securities inc in new 
york 
hughes will lay off workers in all areas of management 
engineering and manufacturing the company said 
hughes a general motors corp subsidiary has 75000 employees 
in 12 states with the bulk of its work force in southern 
california and around tucson ariz 
hughes will try to cushion the blow by making some staff cuts 
through attrition and voluntary resignations and offering 
retraining and jobhunting help 
the companys pentagon work includes manufacture of airtoair 
and airtoground missiles satellites radar for fighter jets and 
other military gear 
the decision was based on executives expectation that defense 
budgets under the bush administration will be smaller than they 
were under ronald reagan the company said 
were getting down to fighting trim said malcolm currie 
hughes chairman and chief executive officer 
industrywide aerospace employment fell 17 percent in 1988 to 
13 million largely because of slower military sales attributed to 
a slowing of the defense buildup begun by reagan a similar decline 
is expected this year according to the aerospace industries 
association which compiles the figures 
the administrations 1990 budget before congress would devote 
2956 billion to the military down from the 3056 billion 
proposed by the outgoing reagan administration and below the 2993 
billion earmarked for this year because the bulk of military 
spending is for such fixedcost items as salary and retirement 
benefits the brunt of any cuts falls on development and purchase 
of hardware 
the result fewer contracts for new aerospace programs 
stretchedout buying schedules for programs already under way and 
layoffs at companies trying to maintain their profits 
every company in the business will be touched by job losses 
over the next year or two predicted howard rubel an industry 
analyst at cyrus j lawrence in new york 
grumman has announced plans to lay off 3000 on long island new 
york and los angelesbased northrop says it plans to cut its 
44000member work force by 2500 to 3000 over the course of the 
year 
to some extent job losses in this normally cyclical industry 
will be offset by a boom in civilian airliner construction 
but only two us companies boeing corp and mcdonnell douglas 
corp make big civilian planes and civil aviation accounts for 
only about 30 percent of the industry 
hughes layoffs arent a response to changes in any one 
contract said spokesman mike murphy who noted that no one 
contract accounts for more than 6 percent of sales he said 
however the company may be smarting from pentagon decisions in 
the last two years to qualify a second company to submit 
competitive bids on several key hughes contracts among the weapons 
are three planelaunched missiles the amraam maverick and 
phoenix which raytheon corp won the right to bid on 
gm doesnt reveal separate financial data for hughes aircraft 
gmhughes electronics corp the aircraft companys parent 
reported profit of 2569 million on sales of 1124 billion in 
1988 that was down from profit of 2192 million on sales of 
1048 billion the year before

coleco industries inc creditors say they have 
agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the troubled toymakers 
11month bankruptcy case 
the settlement announced wednesday during a hearing in us 
bankruptcy court must be approved by the court 
meanwhile no details were released about a proposal by hasbro 
inc the nations largest toy manufacturer to purchase most of 
coleco but daniel golden an attorney for coleco said 
negotiations concerning the sale of most coleco assets continued 
richard tilton a lawyer for hasbro said he expected a joint 
statement on the proposed sale would be issued next week he 
declined to discuss details of the plan saying it still was 
subject to a number of conditions that need to be discussed 
the creditors settlement announced wednesday calls for colecos 
largest creditors isaac perlmutter and bernard marden to receive 
61 million of their 87 million claim against coleco 
unsecured creditors of the company based in avon conn would 
drop their 71 million lawsuit against perlmutter and marden under 
the settlement 
the unsecured creditors had claimed that perlmutter and marden 
secured creditors cheated coleco out of millions of dollars 
through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for 
products 
tilton said the settlement would mean that perlmutter could not 
finance colecos reorganization plan as originally intended but 
tilton said alternative sources of funding could be found he did 
not elaborate 
coleco which grew to be one of the nations largest toymakers 
during the past decade suffered a change in fortune in 1986 when 
demand for its cabbage patch dolls dropped 
new lines introduced by the company failed to make up for lost 
sales and coleco sought bankruptcy court protection last july 
citing debts of 5403 million 
a first reorganization plan filed by coleco in january was 
rejected immediately by the creditors committee 
the plan would have given perlmutter and marden 55 percent of 
the stock of a reorganized coleco and a note for 40 million in 
cash creditors would have received about 36 percent of coleco 
stock and no cash a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every 1 
they are owed 
in march coleco said it was considering a sale of the company 
but reversed itself a few weeks later filing a new reorganization 
plan it hoped would satisfy creditors 
the new plan offered a larger repayment including about 10 
cents for every 1 of debt plus 37 percent of colecos stock 
on april 19 before the second plan was filed with the 
bankruptcy court creditors announced they had negotiated a deal to 
sell most of coleco to hasbro for more than 85 million in cash 
the deal would add wellknown coleco items such as the cabbage 
patch kids and scrabble and parcheesi board games to hasbros 
product lines it has been reported 
coleco officials upset by the hasbro proposal asked us 
bankruptcy judge prudence b abram on april 20 to issue a 
restraining order prohibiting creditors from pursuing the plan with 
hasbro 
instead abram urged the two sides to strike a compromise

freshman engineering enrollments rose last 
fall for the first time since 1982 with minorities making up more 
than half the increase the national action council for minorities 
in engineering said today 
black hispanic and american indian students accounted for 55 
percent of a 27 percent increase in freshman enrollment from fall 
1987 to fall 1988 the organization reported those students posted 
a 138 percent gain from 10325 in 1987 to 11754 in 1988 
the rise in minority participation comes at a time of increasing 
concern over an anticipated shortfall of science and engineering 
professionals the national science foundation estimates that by 
the year 2000 the nation will turn out 400000 fewer scientists 
and engineers than it needs 
council president george campbell said the minority engineering 
gains reflect changing demographics as well as efforts by several 
organizations to increase minority participation in technical 
fields he said his own group spent 11 million over three years 
on more than 20 programs designed to introduce minority students to 
engineering careers and help them develop the academic skills 
needed to enter the field 
the increase in enrollments contrasts with the low rate of 
minority engineering graduates which campbell puts at between 36 
percent and 40 percent the graduation rate nationally is 70 
percent while for asians it is 100 percent 
there is an ongoing problem with blacks hispanics and 
american indians leaving the field campbell said adding there has 
been some recent progress in retaining those students from their 
freshman to sophomore to junior years we cant count them as 
having been retained until they graduate he said 
but we have seen fewer freshmen dropping out than in previous 
years so in 1989 1990 and 1991 we expect to see some improvement 
in retention rates campbell said 
a plethora of reports from teachers corporations universities 
associations and government agencies have cited the need to improve 
math and science education in the lower grades and generate more 
interest among women and minorities who make up a growing 
proportion of the nations work force 
according to the action council one out of three americans will 
be nonwhite by the turn of the century but only 6 percent of 
annual engineering graduates currently are black hispanic or 
american indian 
citing data from the engineering manpower commission the 
council said american indians made the most dramatic percentage 
gain in freshman enrollment from 1987 to 1988 up 223 percent from 
354 to 433 blacks also showed a substantial increase up 151 
percent compared with a 46 boost the year before hispanic 
freshman enrollment increased 11 percent slightly less than a 139 
percent hike from 1986 to 1987

r lifland in new york as an examiner to help reorganize the 
carrier which is a division of texas air corp of houston 
the times citing anonymous sources said shapiro will report 
today that no acceptable buyout bids for the carrier have been 
received 
the lack of an offer deemed acceptable by shapiro is expected to 
reduce the leverage of easterns three main unions in their 
3monthold strike 
the unions recently have supported proposed buyout proposals 
from two investor groups one led by former piedmont airlines 
chairman william howard and the other by chicago commodities trader 
joseph ritchie shapiro has challenged the two groups to put at 
least 100 million of their own cash at risk 
management on the other hand is proceeding with a plan to 
rebuild eastern as a smaller carrier and sell 18 billion of its 
assets 
eastern on wednesday announced an expanded schedule that it said 
will allow the company to recall by july more than 1700 nonunion

the food and drug administration is asking 
contact lens manufacturers to warn people who wear soft contact 
lenses for more than a week without cleaning them that they run the 
risk of eye disease 
certified letters mailed wednesday by the fda asked the 
manufacturers to prepare labels instructing patients not to wear 
the soft extendedwear or disposable lenses for more than seven 
days because of an increased risk of developing ulcerative 
keratitis a disease that can cause blindness 
the fda also sent letters to 60000 eye doctors alerting them 
to the labeling change 
manufacturers have 45 days to comply with the fda request 
dr richard e lippman of the fda said that the new labeling 
will apply only to the soft lenses but he said rigid extendedwear 
lenses already are labeled to limit continuous wear to seven days 
this means that no lens sold in the us should be worn 
continuously longer than seven days he said people should be 
aware that proper lens care is extremely important and great care 
should be taken in the weekly cleaning 
the target of the warnings are soft contact lenses that are 
marketed with instructions that permit continuous wear for up to 30 
days and soft lenses that are marketed as extendedwear 
disposables 
a study sponsored by the contact lens institute an organization 
of the six largest manufacturers of extendedwear lenses showed 
that the risk of ulcertative keratitis is about five times greater 
for extended wear contact users than for those who use daily wear 
lenses 
fda commissioner frank e young said the data from the study 
did not identify a wearing time that will eliminate the risk 
altogether but seven days represents a relatively short 
easytoremember interval which will encourage users to remove 
their lenses and clean them 
some eye experts believe even seven days between cleanings is 
too long and that any lens worn more than one day without proper 
hygiene increases the risk of eye disease 
we do not recommend extendedwear lenses except in some 
circumstances such as elderly people who cannot perform the daily 
lenscleaning routine said dr michael a lemp head of the center 
for eyesight at georgetown university hospital in my view if the 
riskbenefit is based only on convenience it is not acceptable 
ulcerative kertitis is a general term for the formation of an 
ulcer or open sore on the cornea the clear covering of the eye 
which is essential to vision the ulcer is thought to be caused by 
bacteria or parasites that attach themselves to contact lens 
the can come on quite suddenly said lemp the symptoms included 
tearing pain which can be intense sensitivity to light and 
decreased vision 
if a contact lens wearer experiences such symtoms he said they 
should immediately remove the lens and immediately seek medical 
treatment 
the disease is usually treated with topical antibiotics

construction spending propped up by an 
increase in work on government projects edged up a slim 01 
percent in april after dropping in the previous three months the 
commerce department said today 
overall spending on both public and private construction 
projects rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4149 
billion in april after dropping 03 percent in march 06 percent 
in february and 07 percent in january 
the januarymarch string of declines had marked the first time 
construction spending dropped three times in a row since it fell 
for five straight months from february through june 1981 just 
before the start of the 198182 recession 
the construction industry has been among the sectors of the 
economy hardest hit in recent months by the federal reserves 
campaign to push up interest rates to slow economic growth and thus 
restrain inflation 
aprils spending level was 47 percent above the pace in april 
1988 
spending on public construction projects rose 57 percent in 
april to a seasonally adjusted 793 billion the increase included 
an 89 percent rise in construction on highways and streets the 
biggest government category 
the increase in spending on government projects barely offset 
declines in private construction of both residential and 
nonresidential buildings 
spending on private nonresidential construction projects fell 
48 percent in april to an annual rate of 972 billion reflecting 
a downturn in spending on offices motels and hotels hospitals 
and other commercial buildings 
construction of new housing units meanwhile fell 13 percent 
to an annual rate of 1418 billion after falling 12 percent in

snigger if you will but carl lehrburger sees nothing funny 
about disposable diapers in the garbage 
once people get over the frivolousness of the subject they 
will begin to comprehend the sheer magnitude of the problem said 
lehrburger an albany ny recycling expert who crusades against 
what he calls singleuse diapers 
lehrburger warns that products with such comforting names as 
pampers huggies and luvs are ecological booby traps clogging the 
nations landfills with an unhealthy legacy of indestructible 
urinesoaked fecesbearing plasticandpaper time capsules 
our job is to potty train society in terms of how we handle 
our waste he said 
tossaway diapers transformed infant care when they were 
introduced 27 years ago an onerous task became easier cleaner and 
less timeconsuming families with infants and young children could 
travel with ease an entire generation has matured never knowing 
the pricks of diaper pins or odor of diaper pails 
but now the wonder product is under scrutiny for what happens 
after it leaves babys bottom last month nebraska banned the sale 
of nonbiodegradable diapers effective in 1993 lawmakers have 
debated disposable diapers in iowa oregon and washington 
although landfill managers and environmental officials worry 
more about heavy metals and other toxic wastes leaking into ground 
water there is a growing awareness that disposable diapers 
contribute mightily to what is known in the garbage trade as the 
waste stream 
best estimates say disposables account for a relatively small 
12 percent of the nations refuse each year but disposables can 
be disposed of only by burning or burial as a greater percentage 
of discarded paper plastic bottles and cans is recycled the 
problems posed by disposable diapers will become more significant 
i wouldnt put diapers right at the top of my priority list 
im more worried about car batteries but we are concerned about 
them said edward klein deputy director of the environmental 
protection agencys municipal waste program there are a lot of 
unanswered questions about them 
challenges to disposable diapers spring not only from selfless 
concern about the environment lehrburgers research is financed by 
a cotton diaper industry campaigning to recapture its market the 
sponsors of the nebraska law noted that since biodegradable diapers 
use plastic made from cornstarch what might be good for the 
environment might also be good for corn farmers 
nevertheless the disposable diaper presents several specific 
problems of contamination and decomposition 
the main environmental worry is numerical more than 16 billion 
used diapers went from nurseries to landfills last year two 
billion more were incinerated 
by volume 16 billion used diapers would blanket 25 football 
fields and reach 30 stories high if measured by approximate 
weight that many diapers could fill up the wandering garbage barge 
of 1987 every six hours for 322 consecutive days 
the diaper industry says the 18 billion diaper total amounts to 
half of 1 percent of the 160 million tons of garbage accumulated 
last year lehrburger puts it around 2 percent of the total and 
says that would make diapers the third largest single product in 
the american trash pile behind newspapers and containers for food 
and beverages 
when you have a product that has a life of maybe a few hours 
and ends up constituting 2 percent of our municipal solid waste it 
is not an insignificant number he said 
another problem is that disposable diapers cannot be recycled 
for reasons less obvious than what babies deposit in them while 60 
percent of a disposable diaper is wood pulp and fluff that would 
normally decompose easily this is enclosed in an armor of plastic 
that can keep it intact indefinitely 
disposable diapers are a combination of paper fiber and 
plastic and human waste so that is a difficult product to deal 
with said jay shephard a supervisor in the washington state 
department of ecology 
in addition the ultra absorbent disposable diapers contain 
acrylic absorbers crystals of an oilbased polymer that can 
absorb up to 80 times their weight in moisture the chemical 
crystals turn into a thick gel when wet 
the same material was used in ultraabsorbent tampons which 
were suspected of causing toxic shock syndrome tests performed by 
the centers for disease control the consumer product safety 
commission and the us food and drug administration found no 
evidence connecting the diapers and toxic shock 
a third factor is the contents of used diapers beyond the 
regular diseases carried in human waste babies feces carry 
intestinal viruses that cause polio hepatitis and meningitis 
if they get into the ground water they could contaminate the 
water supply said charles gerba a university of arizona 
microbiologist who studies groundwater contamination whether or 
not that has happened no one really knows 
no immediate solution to the diaper dilemma seems clear several 
smaller companies are marketing biodegradable diapers using 
cornstarchbased plastics that break down faster than a regular 
plastic shell but not many hold out hope for that as a solution 
once these are buried in a landfill they dont really 
degrade because of the lack of oxygen and light said neil 
seldman a waste management expert with the institute of local 
selfreliance a think tank for municipal governments based in 
washington dc 
seldman sees a time soon when municipalities and states may add 
fees and taxes to the cost of disposable diapers that has already 
been done in some places with styrofoam products to pay the cost 
of handling specialized trash 
were going to see a widening disparity in the cost of 
reusable and disposable products he said 
but others believe the disposable diaper used by more than 80 
percent of the nations parents has too strong a constituency to 
challenge 
you dont want mad mothers thats the political reality of 
it said bruce walker managing of the recycling program in 
portland ore 
washington state has given 150000 to a pilot project that will 
test ways to sterilize used diapers then strip them into their 
plastic and paper components for recycling 
state legislator georgette valle said she supported the project 
grant precisely because tossaway diapers are such a popular 
product 
i recognize the fact that parents want to use disposable 
diapers so we have to something to get them out of the 
landfill she said 
lehrburger whose work has been sponsored by the national 
association of diaper services and didee service inc of syracuse 
ny talks of taxing disposables and subsidizing the cotton diaper 
industry 
but he thinks the best way to deal with disposables is 
education a role he sees falling on hospitals and daycare centers 
that now use disposables 
it comes down to changing public attitudes he said once 
they learn the consequences there is a perception on the part of 
consumers that their lifestyles are having an effect on the 
environment

at a recent kimberlyclark meeting for wall 
street security analysts the hard questions werent about profits 
sales projections or stock dividends but when to expect a 
biodegradable diaper 
last month the nebraska legislature passed a bill that will 
outlaw the sale of nondegradable diapers oct 1 1993 similar laws 
have been discussed in oregon iowa and washington 
for diaper makers the environment has become a fairly hot 
issue in the last six months said bonita austin who follows the 
consumer product industry for the investment firm wertheim 
schroeder amp co further legislation would intensify pressure on 
manufacturers she said 
the outcry has startled americas 35 billion diaper industry 
which first introduced the disposable a quartercentury ago and has 
since found an immense market for the bundles of tissue wood pulp 
liquidgobbling chemicals and fancy plastic that sell for up to 25 
cents apiece 
the last thing these companies expected was an ecological 
boomerang from a product that has earned enormous profits and is 
still considered one of the most successful innovations ever 
created 
lawmakers consumers investors and ecologists say the 
disposable diaper presents an environmental threat as both a bulky 
singleuse product that cannot be recycled and as a potential 
disease carrier 
pampg and kimberlyclark arent saying exactly how theyre 
planning to respond although both are believed to be working on 
degradable alternatives 
together the companies account for about 75 percent of the 
business of disposable diapers still embraced by a generation of 
grateful parents luvs and pampers are pampgs largest product group 
with roughly 165 billion in annual domestic sales while 
kimberlyclark sells about 840 million worth of its huggies each 
year in the united states analysts say 
despite their enormous size and marketing reach however the 
companies have yet to respond to the growing demand for diapers 
that decompose that has left a hole smaller companies already are 
filling 
for example rmed international inc of tulsa okla has 
started marketing tendercare a nonchemical degradable diaper the 
company claims breaks down to hydrogen oxygen and carbon in a 
decade 
its not perfect but its a heck of a lot better than 500 
years said suzanne sheltonfoley rmeds vice president of 
marketing 
sales have gone from zero to 40000 boxes a month since the 
company introduced them five months ago which is considered 
remarkably strong since most are sold in healthfood stores or over 
the telephone 
tendercare covers contain a plastic that is 6 percent 
cornstarch this innovation not only accelerates the decomposition 
process but has also won support from the national corn growers 
association which sees a sprawling new market for corn 
the association joined forces with environmentalists to lobby 
for the nebraska law 
in 1987 the diaper industry used 177 million pounds of plastic 
that would mean millions of bushels of corn enthused tim 
draeger the associations marketing development assistant 
some experts say diaper makers could easily convert to 
starchimpregnated plastics but manufacturers counter that they 
would have to use considerably more of that material to make a 
sufficiently strong outer cover 
the diaper giants maintain that the technology to make a truly 
degradable plastic isnt available 
theyre definitely working on it but i dont think its 
imminent said austin the securities analyst its not the 
easiest technological gap to hurdle and they cant make the claim 
unless the diaper is truly degradable 
pampg spokesman t scott stewart said the company has found no 
evidence that cornstarchbased plastics quickly degrade if buried 
in modern landfills partly because conventional decomposition 
requires light and oxygen 
kimberlyclark is spending a lot of time and effort to find a 
substitute for the plastic components that would readily degrade in 
a landfill environment said spokeswoman tina barry 
a small but growing number of environmentally sensitized 
consumers are rejecting any disposable diaper biodegradable or 
not theyre turning back to reusable cloth 
theres a heightened consciousness among the enlightened 
people of this country that we cannot go on trashing our world 
said jeff johnston head of tiny tots diaper service in saginaw 
mich and president of the national diaper service association 
over the last few months johnston said his business is up 35 
percent and he estimated services around the country are 
experiencing similar surges 
cloth diapers account for 10 to 15 percent of all the diapers 
used energized by the growing demand the diaper service 
association plans to spend 120000 on advertising next year 
promoting cotton diapers as an alternative 
thats a lot of money for the diaper assocation but nothing 
compared with the megabudgets for advertising and promotion spent 
by pampg and kimberlyclark which are expected continue to boost 
their products vigorously even if theyre quietly researching 
alternatives 
the big diaper companies oppose legislation that would ban or 
restrict nondegradable disposables since by their reckoning these 
products account for less than 1 percent of solid waste in the 
country 
moreover the diaper giants are giving no outward indication 
they plan to shrink their lines of disposables because of the 
environmental issue on the contrary theyve been expanding them 
with gimmicks that range from elasticized waistbands to mickey 
mouse designs on the plastic linings 
kimberlyclark appears to have the latest edge using technology 
that allows fluid to flow in only one direction the company claims 
this ensures diapers stay dry for hours after theyre soiled it 
also has introduced disposable training pants called pullups that 
sell for about 50 cents each 
barry characterized claims by such small companies as rmed as 
grandiose were not going to jump on that bandwagon what 
people care about with a disposable diaper is performance and it 
has gained in popularity as the quality improved 
nonetheless she said if degradability becomes something the 
majority of consumers desire its certainly something we would 
have to respond to

ken sakamura dreams of a future in which billions 
of compatible computers link together the worlds people creating 
understanding and peace 
but the us government says his new basic computer design 
named tron may be an unfair trade barrier that restricts us 
access to the japanese market 
sakamura a 37yearold computer scientist at the university of 
tokyo says such charges are a misunderstanding 
in the current climate of trade friction anything new and 
japanese is considered an economic threat by people in other 
countries he says its very sad because it overlooks how tron 
can help all the people of the world both economically and 
culturally 
tron escaped being named as a major trade barrier in the us 
trade representatives report last week that focused on japanese 
policy on imports of supercomputers forestry products and 
satellites but tron remains a matter of concern to us officials 
and computer firms 
sakamura says he created tron a computer architecture or 
basic set of operating specifications to make future computers 
more compatible and flexible and has offered it free of charge to 
anyone 
with tron he says computer operations would become as 
standardized as the controls in cars giving anyone the ability to 
operate virtually any computer 
tron which stands for the realtime operating system nucleus 
also would allow future homes and offices to have dozens of 
computers linked together in a single network while houses and 
communities could be connected into intelligent cities he says 
in a tron intelligent house sakamura says if the volume of 
the stereo system is turned up a miniature computer could notify 
another computer which would close the windows to avoid disturbing 
the neighbors that computer would then inform a microcomputer in 
the air conditioner which would turn on to keep the temperature 
from rising 
outside computers could sense a child crossing the street and 
tell computers in oncoming cars to stop he says 
sakamura isnt alone in his dream in the past year 126 
computerrelated companies including 18 foreign firms have joined 
the tron association which promotes his design the list includes 
most of the worlds leading semiconducter makers 
six japanese manufacturers are currently developing advanced 
32bit tron microprocessors and the first full tron computer is 
expected in 1991 
a tron intelligent house currently under construction in 
tokyo by a group of 16 companies is slated to contain 380 computers 
and be completed by the end of this year the rice cooker lights 
telephones baths videocassette recorders air conditioners 
stereo equipment and a host of other appliances are tied together 
in a computer network for easy control 
a 12story 35 million tron intelligent building planned in 
tokyo will incorporate more than 10000 interlinked microcomputers 
developers say 
dwarfing those projects is a computerized tron city planned 
by 20 companies in chiba prefecture outside of tokyo about 1000 
people are expected to live in the 250acre area expected to cost 
about 715 million to build 
the office of the us trade representative in its preliminary 
report on trade restrictons said moves to adopt the tron standard 
in japan could hurt sales of us computers and give japanese 
companies an unfair advantage 
while japanese makers have developed tron products no us 
manufacturer is in a position to sell tronbased pcs personal 
computers or telecommunications equipment it said 
in recent negotiations in japan us trade officials said they 
were particularly concerned that japanese government procurements 
that specified the tron standard would place us companies at a 
disadvantage 
in january japans semiprivate telecommunications giant 
nippon telegraph and telephone corp announced it will use the 
tron standard for its future digital communications network 
a committee formed by japanese government industry and local 
educational agencies also has set specifications for purchases of 
school computers which may give an advantage to tron equipment the 
us trade report said 
but says sakamura trons basic philosophy is openness so 
anyone can use tron specifications at no charge 
ironically some analysts attribute japanese companies 
enthusiasm for tron in part to restrictions that us semiconductor 
makers have placed on japanese use of usdeveloped computer 
microprocessors 
a us electronics industry source says american officials also 
fear that tron could replace usdeveloped operating systems such 
as unix and msdos and thereby reduce us leadership in the 
industry 
the industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
some us companies might feel it was too much of an imposition 
to adjust to tron 
sakamura says all computer and software firms would benefit if 
tron is widely adopted because their products could sell anywhere 
including japan without modifications 
but he says trons greatest contribution will be in allowing the 
people of the world to communicate more easily 
tron provides for 48400 multilingual characters as well as the 
direct transfer of images while the current ascii standard for 
transferring data between computers provides for only 128 roman 
letters numbers and symbols 
hopefully a new world economic order will develop around this 
new culture and communication order creating the foundation for 
cooperation and less fighting among peoples sakamura says 
that may sound like a dream however im a computer 
architect and the more i dream about the future the better i can 
do my job of designing computer architecture for it

productivity in the nonfarm business sector 
of the economy fell at an annual rate of 11 percent in the first 
quarter helping trigger a significant increase in unit labor 
costs the government reported today 
the labor departments revised data for firstquarter 
productivity should prove disturbing to analysts who have said 
improved output per hour by american workers is essential to curb 
inflation and make up for labor shortages in some fields 
the government in may had reported productivity on a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate rose 05 percent in the first three months of 
1989 compared to the final quarter of 1988 that report also listed 
a 52 percent increase at an annual rate as well in unit labor 
costs for the first quarter 
but revised data released today showed productivity declined at 
an annual rate of 11 percent as output rose 22 percent while 
hours worked climbed 34 percent from the prior quarter 
that compared to a 10 percent gain in productivity on an annual 
basis n the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 15 percent gain reported 
for all of last year 
unit labor costs rose 66 percent in the quarter on an annual 
basis up from the 52 percent reported in the preliminary data in 
may and higher still than the 41 percent increase reported in the 
fourth quarter of 1988 
the jump in unit labor costs reflected the decline in 
productivity and a 54 percent increase on an annual basis of 
hourly wages in the quarter that figure was revised downward from 
the previously reported 57 percent but was still up from the 52 
percent annual increase reported for the fourth quarter and the 46 
percent jump for all of 1988 
but the data showed consumer inflation continues to erode the 
wage gains made by workers 
although hourly pay on average climbed 54 percent on an annual 
basis in the first quarter real hourly compensation was unchaged 
because consumer prices rose at the same rate as wages 
in the manufacturing sector productivity in the first quarter 
rose 21 percent on an annual basis down from the 38 percent gain 
reported in mays preliminary data revised data showed output rose 
28 percent in that sector while hours worked climbed by 07 
percent unit labor costs in manufacturing rose a revised 20 
percent in the first quarter on an annual basis 
th sector reporting the most significant productivity declines 
was nonfinancial corporations which reported a 13 percent drop 
in output per hour in the first quarter that figure was unchanged 
from the previous data but the downward revisions in other sectors 
brought overall nonfarm productivity into a decline 
in the overall business sector which includes agriculture 
productivity was up 17 percent in the first quarter at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate down from the 35 percent gain 
reported in mays early data for the first quarter

a federal judge here has struck down a 50year 
federal ban on listing the alcohol content of beer on bottles and 
cans in a first amendment challenge brought by adolph coors co 
us district judge zita weinshienks ruling on wednesday 
cleared the way for the golden brewer to list the alcohol content 
of its products 
coors felt this was a right consumers have and that they ought 
to be able to be told what the alcohol content is in whatever 
beverage they are drinking said coors spokesman neil peters 
coors has been trying to emphasize through advertising that beer 
is the alcoholic beverage of moderation and that its beer does not 
contain less alcohol than its competitors 
coors the nations fourthlargest brewer had filed a lawsuit 
against the treasury department over a law passed in the 1930s 
during the postprohibition era 
when it approved the federal alcohol administration act 
congress was reacting to fears that brewers would try to boost 
sales by touting their beer as stronger the ban does not apply to 
distilled liquor and wines which routinely list their alcohol 
content 
coors lawsuit contended the ban violated coors right to free 
speech under the first amendment 
coors challenge was not opposed by the executive branch of the 
federal government but the us house of representatives joined 
the case as a defendant 
congressional attorney janina jaruzelski had contended that 
repealing the ban would lead to misleading information but 
weinshienk rejected that argument

mai basic four inc lowered its offer for prime 
computer inc today and said it had firm commitments of financing 
needed to complete the deal 
although the offer was lower than the old one which was valued 
at about 970 million investors apparently thought it was more 
credible 
prime was up 37 cents a share at 1675 in early composite new 
york stock exchange trading today after gaining 25 cents a share on 
wednesday 
prime said it was evaluating the offer 
the new offer is 1950 a share in cash for the 495 million 
shares of prime currently outstanding plus securities with a face 
value of 21 a share for other shares of prime that could be issued 
through the exercise of options 
the old offer was 20 a share all in cash for all shares 
investors are likely to value the paper portion of the offer at 
less than the stated 21 a share so it is hard to put a total 
value on the new offer 
mai basic a computer maker based in tustin calif has been 
pursuing prime since november it is about a fourth the size of 
prime a maker of minicomputers and computeraided design equipment 
based in natick mass 
mai basic came up with the new lower bid after prime last month 
challenged it to come up with financing for the old bid or drop it 
bennett s lebow the chairman of mai basic said it lowered the 
bid because primes earnings projections had worsened and prime had 
created potentially expensive employeebenefit and pension plans 
known as golden parachutes 
mai basic said its 14 billion backing for the new bid 
consisted of 550 million from drexel burnham lambert group inc 
400 million from canadian imperial bank of commerce 300 million 
from merrill lynch amp co and 150 million from brooke partners lp 
the money would go to pay off old debts buy prime and provide 
working capital for the combined company

when the telephone on owen f biebers desk 
rings it could be a retired autoworker wondering about a pension 
payment it could just as easily be chrysler corp chairman lee 
iacocca 
the 6foot5 250pound president of the united auto workers 
union cuts a dominating figure as leader of 1 million laborers in 
one of the most competitive us manufacturing industries 
but his authority is facing a simmering challenge from 
dissidents who claim hes too chummy with the big three bosses and 
has forsaken the unions historical role as militant defender of 
workers rights 
although bieber expects reelection at the uaw convention later 
this month hes concerned about what he calls the misguided 
motives of the new directions opposition faction led by st 
louis activist jerry tucker 
weve always prided ourselves in being a union that has 
encouraged debate he said in an interview we have difficulty 
and we have problems and i speak out when there are people who 
under the guise of some of those things really are out attacking 
the union hurting the union 
in his six years as leader of the uaw bieber has guided it into 
uncharted territory responding to what hes called the rapidly 
changing economic landscape that has reshaped the relationships 
between companies and unions 
bieber has helped establish joint labormanagement programs on 
the assembly line aimed at meeting the competition from foreign 
automakers hes pushed the union into organizing drives outside 
the auto industry signing members who range from nurses to police 
to jaialai ballplayers 
perhaps more importantly bieber sits on the board of chrysler 
elbowtoelbow with iacocca and 17 other pinstriped directors a 
relationship once unthinkable in the volatile sometimes violent 
history of the autoworkers 
im the only voice there who comes from the other side of the 
street so to speak he said they tend to think alike because 
they are alike 
im smart enough to know that unless everybody lost their 
senses including lee iacocca its not going to come down to the 
situation where im going to win a raw vote after all its 
18to1 
even when you get beat 181 you have an opportunity to get 
your message across 
bieber 59 joined uaw local 687 in 1948 at mcinerney spring and 
wire co in grand rapids mich 12 years after the union was born 
during the bloody sitin protests at general motors corp plants 
across the state in flint 
during the 1960s while still working in southwest michigan he 
helped organize workers in his home state and in northern indiana 
and illinois at the time many business were leaving cities to 
avoid unions and heading to his region which was dogged by high 
unemployment 
they would use fear of a job loss to entice people to stay away 
from the union bieber said in response uaw recruiters would talk 
with workers intensively trying to convince them that what 
managers were doing was illegal 
in some cases the union would take companies before the 
national labor relations board 
they made no bones in those days about saying to people hey 
we came up here from detroit to get away from the union and high 
wages now if you get union here well move back to detroit 
bieber said 
now and then theyd pull up stakes and move to another part 
of the state or maybe move over the indiana line all violations of 
the law bieber said you clipped them in those days 
we used to get some pretty healthy back payments and so on 
because the board did enforce the law today youre tied up three 
or four or five years 
it takes a lot of fortitude on the part of people 
bieber has never avoided a political scrap inside or outside 
the union a picture of south african anglican bishop desmond tutu 
the nobel laureate and antiapartheid activist hangs on biebers 
wall with a handwritten message thank you for your support god 
bless you 
when asked if he saw any difference between the reagan and bush 
administrations bieber looked puzzled 
i dont know what president bushs program is he said he 
has not laid one out 
he singled out bushs handling of strike at eastern airlines 
saying the president missed an opportunity to show leadership by 
appointing a commission to mediate the dispute now 3 months old 
bieber also criticized what he described as the republican white 
houses double standard on organized labor domestically and 
overseas he mentioned the reemergence of the solidarity union in 
poland as an example 
president bush has spoken out affirmatively on behalf of 
solidarity and im happy for that he said i just wish he 
would recognize that a flourishing union in the united states of 
america would be just as important here as a flourishing union in 
poland will indeed be to that country its economy and its standard 
of living

the productivity of american workers slipped 
in the first quarter while unit labor costs shot up more than 6 
percent on an annual basis the government said thursday in a 
report analysts cited as proof both of a slowing economy and 
stubborn inflation 
the labor departments revised figures for the first three 
months of the year showed a 11 percent decline in nonfarm 
business productivity at an annual rate down from the 05 percent 
gain reported in preliminary firstquarter data issued last month 
unit labor costs a key determinant of overall inflation rose 
a revised 66 percent on an annual basis in the quarter said the 
government which in the earlier report had pegged the increase at 
52 percent 
in other economic data thursday the government reported a slim 
01 percent increase in construction spending in april after three 
straight monthly declines the improvement in that sector among 
those hardest hit by higher interest rates was attributed largely 
to work on government projects 
the reports were in line with other data indicating a 
significant slowdown in the rate of economic expansion in the first 
quarter followed by somewhat improved growth in the first two 
months of the second quarter analysts expect fridays unemployment 
report for may to put a more definitive stamp on secondquarter 
trends 
the economy is slowing down but its certainly not stopping 
said chief economist david wyss of drimcgrawhill of lexington 
mass 
the 11 percent decline in productivity compared with a 1 
percent annual gain in the fourth quarter of 1988 and an overall 
1988 gain of 15 percent it was the first decline in productivity 
since a sharp drop of 24 percent on an annual basis in the second 
quarter of last year the revised data said the 11 percent decline 
resulted from a 22 percent increase in output but a greater 
increase 34 percent in the total hours worked 
the jump in unit labor costs was the biggest since the second 
quarter of last year as well the government at that time reported 
a 68 percent increase on an annual basis for all of 1988 unit 
labor costs rose 31 percent 
the revised numbers were not entirely unexpected 
last weeks downward revision of the gross national product for 
the first quarter brought predictions that the productivity gain 
reported in mays preliminary data was erroneous 
still the rate of decline was surprising to some analysts and 
of greater concern was the inflationary pressures demonstrated by 
the big jump in labor costs 
the results are distinctly inflationary said allen sinai 
chief economist for boston co economic advisers inc the true 
core of inflation in the united states is really unit labor costs 
this is indeed a dismal statement and makes the outlook for a 
quick and accelerated reduction in inflation very very poor 
analysts who for some time have been raising alarms about 
sluggish productivity gains took thursdays report as further 
evidence that major reductions in the trade deficit will not come 
until us business makes a substantial commitment to improving 
productivity which in turn would reduce unit labor costs 
at the same time however they said declining productivity as 
reported thursday would slice profit margins and make business less 
willing to make capital investments in equipment and training 
needed to bolster productivity and they said pressure on profits 
would trigger price increases and exacerbate inflationary pressures 
lack of productivity is one of the major problems in this 
country said washingtonbased economist michael evans this is 
not the first bad report weve had although its the worst in some 
time the inflationary pressures are starting to creep up 
again 
sinai said the continued evidence of inflationary pressures 
likely would convince federal reserve policymakers to continue the 
central banks current tight rein on credit despite growing 
pressure to ease 
also in the productivity report was evidence that wage gains 
made by american workers are being wiped out by consumer price 
inflation 
the labor department said average hourly pay climbed 54 percent 
on an annual basis in the first quarter but real hourly 
compensation wage gains minus consumer price inflation was 
unchanged compared with the fourth quarter of 1988 
the commerce departments report on construction activity said 
spending on both public and private construction projects rose to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4149 billion in april after 
dropping 03 percent in march 06 percent in february and 07 
percent in january

mai basic four inc lowered its tender offer for 
prime computer inc on thursday by 50 cents a share and said the 
offer would no longer be all cash citing reductions in primes 
projected results for 1989 and 1990 
prime temporarily removed its takeover defenses on may 15 and 
challenged tustin califbased mai either to complete a takeover 
by june 2 at its original offer of 20 cash per share or to drop 
its bid altogether 
but one day before that deadline mai chairman bennett s lebow 
said the offer was dropping to 1950 cash per share for primes 
495 million outstanding shares 
mai also said it would exchange securities with a face value of 
21 for each of 162 million additional shares that could be issued 
to owners of prime options and convertible bonds 
since investors are likely to value the paper portion of the 
offer at less than the stated 21 a share it is hard to put a 
total value on the new offer the original offer was estimated to 
be worth about 970 million 
prime a natickbased maker of minicomputers and computeraided 
design equipment said its board would meet promptly to consider 
mais revised terms but prime spokesman joseph gavaghan said the 
company had serious reservations about the offer 
after six months of public statements by mai that it was 
committed to its 20 per share cash offer for all of primes 
shares mai has now lowered its cash price changed to a partial 
offer and is offering mai stock and bonds of questionable value for 
a significant portion of primes fully diluted shares gavaghan 
said 
lebow said mais revised offer represents a full and fair 
price in light of primes recent lowering of revenue projections 
in a may 15 filing with the securities and exchange commission 
prime said it expected its annual revenues to increase 6 percent 
this year and 9 percent in 1990 down from earlier projections of 
10 percent this year and 122 percent next year 
lebow also said the revised offer was justified by the fact 
that primes directors have adopted various employee benefit and 
pension plans which mai believes could cost up to 170 million 
securities analysts said the lower offer was not surprising 
because earnings and stock prices for many computer makers are down 
this year and prime has been unable to find a buyer willing to pay 
more than 20 per share 
its a tease said charles m foundyller president of 
daratech inc a market research firm in cambridge its 
basically just enough that if youre a stockholder or a board 
member you really want to think about it but its probably 
less than you could get a year and a half from now 
mai reaffirmed its intention to wage a proxy battle for control 
of primes board at its june 14 annual meeting if the current 
directors do not agree to a takeover 
mai also said it had firm commitments for 14 billion in 
financing to cover the tender offer pay off debts and provide 
working capital those commitments consist of 550 million from 
drexel burnham lambert group inc 400 million from the canadian 
imperial bank of commerce 300 million from merrill lynch amp co 
and 150 million from an mai affiliate brooke partners lp it 
said 
mai which is about onefourth the size of prime owns about 12 
million shares of prime stock since it launched its hostile bid in 
nov 15 333 million shares were tendered under the 20 offer 
representing nearly 70 percent of the outstanding shares and just 
under 50 percent of primes stock on a fully diluted basis

the hand thats feeding new york mayoral 
candidate rudolph giuliani is the same one he was biting not long 
ago 
in five and a half years as manhattan us attorney giuliani 
engineered highly public investigations of wall street investment 
firms and denounced what he termed systemic insider trading 
abuses 
now hes getting major campaign support from top lawyers and 
executives on wall street where some labeled him as a 
publicitymad zealot who abused his considerable prosecutorial 
powers to crack down on securities fraud 
the fact that i made a contribution to his mayoral effort has 
nothing to do with his performance in any case or lack of 
performance said attorney paul j curran who butted heads with 
giuliani over an insider trading case in which an arbitrager was 
handcuffed and frisked before his colleagues 
more than 20 top executives are included in an inner circle of 
about 145 friends of rudy giuliani who raised more than 
800000 at a 500aplate campaign luncheon at the waldorf astoria 
hotel this week 
major players from merrill lynch amp co bear stearns amp co 
morgan stanley amp co salomon brothers inc shearson lehman hutton 
inc smith barney harris upham amp co and painewebber inc are on 
the list 
the roster also includes the head of donaldson lufkin and 
jenrette inc one of the nations 15 largest securities firms two 
general partners at the investment bank lazard freres co and a 
founder of the leveraged buyout powerhouse forstmann little amp co 
i dont think its surprising because i think the people on 
wall street have the same concerns as other people in the city 
have said giuliani press secretary charles perkins the 
problems of crime and corruption are problems whether you work on 
wall street or at a factory in the bronx 
giuliani is vying with multimillionaire businessman ronald s 
lauder for the republican nomination in a bid to unseat 12year 
democratic mayor edward i koch who is facing challenges within 
his own party 
many of giulianis pinstriped supporters said they are backing 
the 44yearold former prosecutor because he is the first strong 
republican contender for mayor in this heavily democratic city 
since john v lindsay in the 1960s 
they like his tough pledge to take back the city from 
violent criminals drug dealers and crooked politicians who have 
abandoned their oath of office they want him to improve public 
education because as one wall street supporter said i cant get 
a receptionist that can type 
some even say giulianis highly publicized campaign against 
financial sleaze was just what wall street needed in a decade of 
excess 
look he did a job he was supposed to do said muriel 
siebert the first woman member of the new york stock exchange who 
heads her own brokerage firm i really feel if you want the 
truth that weve had a hell of a lot of greed downtown 
under giuliani who stepped down at the end of january the 
manhattan us attorneys office brought charges in more than 50 
securities fraud cases using aggressive tactics that agitated many 
in the financial community 
the most frequently cited case of excessiveness was the february 
1987 arrest of robert freeman a partner at goldman sachs amp co 
and two kidder peabody amp co executives one of whom was taken in 
handcuffs and tears from the firms trading floor 
three months later charges against the three were dropped and 
despite promises from giuliani no new indictments have been 
brought giuliani has conceded that the arrests were made too soon 
his nemesis in that case was freemans attorney curran now a 
campaign financier curran said the case hasnt affected his 
support for giuliani a longtime friend and assistant prosecutor 
under curran in the mid1970s 
i do my commenting on the freeman case in court curran said 
thats curran said securities defense lawyer stanley arkin 
who represented one of the two kidder executives and is not 
endorsing giulianis cause some people have put it aside and 
some havent 
the latter group includes drexel burnham lambert inc kidder 
peabody and goldman sachs all major targets during giulianis 
tenure no one from those firms is listed as a friend of rudy 
giuliani 
were all aware of what the criticism is said giuliani 
backer chris randolph a shearson senior vice president over 
time i think we will know whether there is a legitimate criticism 
or not

when president reagan traveled to britain a year 
ago the country was basking in economic glory but president 
bushs visit comes against a far different backdrop 
inflation and labor strikes familiar symptoms of the 1970s 
british economic disease are putting a damper on prime minister 
margaret thatchers economic revolution 
as bush met with mrs thatcher this week london was disrupted 
by its fifth 24hour subway strike this year bbc journalists and 
technicians have curtailed television and radio programs dock 
workers are threatening to walk away from britains 40 ports 
the strikes are hardly comparable to the disruption that helped 
topple the labor party government in 1979 and inflation is still 
below the 103percent level when mrs thatcher took office a 
decade ago 
but goldman sachs international said in its monthly economic 
review the recent upsurge in labor unrest raises unpleasant 
memories of the 1970s and must cast still more doubt on how much 
the united kingdom has really changed under mrs thatcher 
by championing free markets keeping a tight grip on fiscal 
spending and curbing union power mrs thatcher transformed an 
ailing economy into a boom that has been hailed as a miracle gross 
domestic product grew nearly 4 percent in 1988 and is expected to 
grow by up to 28 percent this year 
while the strikes may be only sporadic a more ominous threat 
lies in resurgent inflation rising interest rates and a sudden 
weakening of the british pound 
a year ago chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawsons sweeping 
tax cuts made him the hero of his conservative party now the 
british press is speculating that mrs thatcher will oust him in a 
cabinet reshuffle before july and on wednesday the pound dipped on 
rumors that he had already quit 
a recent poll showed that the labor party having dumped some of 
its votelosing defense and socialist doctrines has a 43percent 
approval rating two points ahead of the conservatives 
experts say odds are rising that the economy will suffer a 
slowdown or what they call a hard landing 
less has changed since the 1970s than might have been hoped 
said a report by the independent national institute of economic and 
social research citing britians annual inflation rate which 
stood at 8 percent in april 
that rate has more than doubled in the past year to the highest 
among major industrialized nations lawson predicted in march that 
the rate would peak at 8 percent but private economists think it 
may go even higher before easing 
mrs thatchers fight against inflation has been made more 
difficult by the pounds fall which makes imports more expensive 
the government responded by pushing up key interest rates a full 
percentage point to 14 percent last week 
it was the 10th increase since interest rates reached a decade 
low of 75 percent about a year ago the latest hike brought the 
rate to its highest level in more four years and economists say it 
could go higher still 
meanwhile the trade deficit has ballooned to 13 billion this 
year from 85 billion a year ago 
the strikes mostly for higher pay are expected to subside 
after a current round of wage negotiations but they are causing 
fears of a wageprice spiral as workers whose earnings increased 
at an annual rate of 95 percent in april demand even more money 
to offset inflation 
critics blame the economys overheating on lawsons tax cuts and 
a loosened monetary policy but the chancellor says the setback is 
temporary overheating is on the way to subsiding he said last 
week it is only a matter of time before inflation is coming 
down

occidental chemical corp has for the first 
time agreed to take some responsibility for cleaning up chemical 
contamination at the old love canal industrial dump area officials 
said thursday 
occidental has signed a consent agreement that calls for it to 
take over disposal of toxic wastes excavated from two creeks near 
the neighborhood in nearby niagara falls 
the agreement could save taxpayers up to 20 million said state 
environmental conservation commissioner thomas jorling 
we have succeeded in getting occidental to accept some 
responsibility and take an active role in the remediation of love 
canal even though the company continues to fight its liability for 
this national disaster jorling said 
an occidental subsidiary hooker chemical co used an abandoned 
waterway project as a chemical dump in the 1940s the dump was 
covered over in the 1950s and homes were built on the site in the 
1960s in the 1970s toxic chemicals began seeping into basements 
and yards causing health problems 
occidental has taken the position that it was not responsible 
for the environmental disaster because it had sold the land and 
took no part in housing development at the site 
under the agreement occidental will take contaminated sediment 
dredged from creeks north of the companys former chemical dump and 
store it at a newly constructed facility at its niagara falls 
plant the sediment is contaminated with chemicals including the 
class of toxic chemicals called dioxins that seeped out of the 
dump or washed in from sewers 
the waste eventually is to be incinerated officials said 
jorling who flew to buffalo to make the announcement said 
occidental has grown to respect the liability aspects of the 
law 
but he stressed that it was a very limited agreement 
directed to a single remedial action and leaves many issues 
unresolved at other occidental sites 
occidental which abbreviates its name as oxychem issued a 
statement later 
the decisions and actions discussed here today by the 
regulatory agencies mean that we can immediately move forward on a 
program that oxychem strongly believes to be in the best overall 
interests of the community and the environment said thomas l 
jennings the companys vice president for corporate environmental 
affairs

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade bucking the recent 
trend caused by droughtquenching midwest rains 
i think we probably have factored a lot of rainfall into these 
markets said anne frick senior oilseed analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
weve had sort of a steady spate of rain now for the past two 
or three weeks and the result has been that we have replenished the 
soil moisture situation in the eastern corn belt she said the 
west still has low subsoil supplies but the topsoil has good soil 
moisture conditions 
the rain has alleviated fears of a rerun of last years drought 
many traders who had sold the market earlier in the month hoping 
that prices would fall returned as buyers on thursday 
at the close wheat was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 388 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to 1 cents higher with july at 260 a bushel oats were 4 
cents to 5 cents higher with july at 172 a bushel soybeans were 
7 cents lower to 9 cents higher with july at 707 a bushel

eddie mansfield has never traded a futures 
contract yet his is one of the bestknown names to traders on the 
floor of the chicago board of trade 
his contributions to the commodities industry may never make it 
into the history books but leaders of the worlds oldest and 
largest futures exchange say the longtime security guard and 
grand marshal of the exchange will never be forgotten 
mansfields 65 years of service were honored with a retirement 
party thursday attended by hundreds of wellwishers and held near 
the entrance to the board of trades graintrading floor which in 
1985 officially was dubbed the edward e mansfield trading room 
the area is one where mansfield spent much his career as the 
exchanges chief security guard checking for unfamiliar faces 
among those heading for the trading pits 
even though the exchange has been stung by recent accusations 
about cheating and greed among its traders eddie mansfield says he 
wouldnt trade away a minute of his 65 years of board of trade 
memories 
its the greatest institution in the world as far as i am 
concerned mansfield 81 said thursday 
nowadays traders enter the trading floor through turnstiles 
activated by magnetic cards just one of the changes mansfield has 
witnessed in his years with the exchange 
when he was hired at the board of trade as a messenger at age 
16 with no goals except helping to feed his mother and five 
siblings the exchange was a market where farmers displayed samples 
of their grains and prices were relayed by morse code and displayed 
on a large chalkboard 
these days nearly all trades are settled by cash rather than 
physical delivery prices are transmitted electronically and 
graintrading volume is dwarfed by activity in financial products 
such as us treasury bond futures 
mansfield who lives comfortably on the 31st floor of a 
highrise overlooking lake michigan can tick off the names of 
traders who piled up astounding fortunes in the grain pits but he 
said he never felt compelled to plunge into that risky business 
i might have had a temptation but i had a responsibility to 
my wife and three children so i didnt trade he said 
mansfield had only nice things to say about commodity traders 
and the futures industry which has been beset with federal 
investigations of alleged cheating 
its hard for me to believe it he said with most 
members integrity is the name of the game theyre full of 
integrity and theyre gentlemen 
after stepping down as head of security more than 15 years ago 
the whitehaired wizened mansfield remained at the board of trade 
as the exchanges grand marshal greeting the many dignitaries who 
visit the historic marketplace 
he recalled president carter as the nice short fella and 
remembered president reagan as the fella with a big head of 
hair 
mansfield received the claude d pepper distinguished service 
award an honor reserved for people over 55 employed by chicago 
firms in 1985 he was lauded by the illinois legislature in a 
resolution adopted on his 80th birthday 
but perhaps the greatest honor was thursdays farewell message 
from board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann who said eddie 
couldnt be more of a board of trader if he wore a yellow badge 
signifying a full membership in the exchange well be missing 
you and well always remember you

the dollar finished mixed against major foreign 
currencies thursday failing to hold gains made as the west german 
central bank decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged 
some traders thought the bundesbanks inaction was good news for 
the dollar because it meant investors would not pull money out of 
dollars to take advantage of higher west german rates 
a rally in the dollar began in anticipation of the decision by 
the bundesbanks policymaking council and faded soon after the 
actual announcement 
the dollar finished the day marginally higher against the west 
german mark french franc and italian lira and slightly slower 
against the japanese yen british pound swiss franc and canadian 
dollar

morellino a trader at banque indosuez in new york 
many big players preferred to remain on the sidelines while 
finance ministers from the major industrialized nations met at the 
organization for economic cooperation and development in paris 
dealers said 
a west german rate hike would have followed similar moves by 
japan switzerland and britain those moves were largely targeted 
at the surging dollar which had climbed above 2 west german marks

feeder cattle futures prices soared thursday on speculation that 
falling grain prices will encourage feedlot operators to buy more 
cattle to fatten 
on other markets grains and soybeans ended mostly higher 
bucking the recent trade copper futures prices dropped sharply 
while precious metals rose and energy futures were mixed 
feeder cattle settled 118 cents to 150 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in august at 7795 cents a pound both the 
august and september contracts traded up the daily limit 
in other livestock and meat trading live cattle were 15 cent 
to 78 cent higher with june at 6905 cents a pound live hogs were 
10 cent to 45 cent higher with june at 4832 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to 65 cent higher with july at 
3052 cents a pound 
the rally was rooted in perceptions that the sharp drop in corn 
and soybean futures prices over the past three weeks a result of 
increased midwest rainfall would reduce feedlot operators feed 
costs leaving them with more money with which to purchase cattle 
the feedercattle markets initial gains of 60 cent to 70 cent 
triggered waves of computer fund buying which pushed the market to 
the limit the bullish fever also spread to the adjacent 
livecattle pit although lower grain prices are likely to lead to 
lower not higher prices for slaughterready animals 
its hard to stand in the live cattle pit and not be 
influenced by whats going on right next to you said chuck 
levitt senior livestock market analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in chicago 
most grain and soybean futures prices rose on the chicago board 
of trade bucking the recent trend and suggesting the markets have 
absorbed as much rain as is likely to fall in the midwest for at 
least a week 
i think we probably have factored a lot of rainfall into these 
markets said anne frick senior oilseed analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
recent rains have alleviated fears of a rerun of last years 
drought many traders who had sold earlier in the month hoping 
that prices would fall returned as buyers on thursday 
wheat settled 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with july at 388 
a bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with july at 
260 a bushel oats were 4 cents to 5 cents higher with july at 
171 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents lower to 8 cents higher with 
july at 708 a bushel 
copper futures prices fell sharply on new yorks commodity 
exchange reflecting a supply expansion after two years of extreme 
tightness 
copper consumption is entering a period of seasonal weakness 
further contributing to the markets softening after a runup to a 
record high of 16475 a pound in december 
this is a market that has kind of gone from miracle to miracle 
and has run out of support said craig sloane a metals analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co 
copper settled 245 cents to 325 cents lower with june at 
1102 a pound 
precious metals recovered slightly from wednesdays slide on the 
commodity exchange 
gold settled 80 cents higher across the board with june at 
36410 a troy ounce silver was 35 cents to 38 cents higher with 
june at 5198 a troy ounce 
oil futures prices were mixed in quiet trading on the new york

petroleum futures prices were mixed in quiet 
trading thursday with many investors moving to the sidelines to 
await the outcome of next weeks opec meeting 
pressure has been building within the cartel to raise its 
selfimposed quota by more than 1 million barrels a day a move 
that some fear will dampen prices 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us fell 9 cents to 
close at 1981 a barrel other contract months rose 
among refined products wholesale unleaded gasoline for july

considerably in the last two weeks was grinding to a 
nearstandstill as the market turned its attention to vienna where 
the 13 ministers of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries are gathering for their semiannual meeting 
the meeting scheduled for monday was to be preceded by a 
meeting of the cartels pricemonitoring committee on friday eight 
ministers form that group 
analysts said new speculation that the cartel would raise its 
current 185 million barrelperday production ceiling by between 1 
million and 15 million barrels set a bearish tone for the market

heard more definite said greg dreis energy broker with merrill 
lynch energy futures 
crude oil prices have risen more than 30 percent from around 15 
last november when opec agreed to lower its production to 185 
million barrels from more than 22 million the quota was to remain 
in effect for the first six months of 1989 to drive prices up to at 
least 18 a barrel

klm royal dutch airlines is part of an 
investment group led by los angeles investor alfred checchi that 
has submitted a friendly bid to buy nwa inc the parent of 
northwest airlines a klm spokesman said thursday 
klm spokesman peter wellhuener said the dutch state airliner has 
a commitment to an american investment group headed by mr alfred 
checchi to take an indirect interest in the company bidding for 
northwest 
wellhuener refused further comment citing the confidentiality 
of the agreement between checchi and amsterdambased klm 
nwa stock rose 87 cents thursday to close at 10837 in 
composite new york stock exchange trading 
mike hamilton an analyst for minneapolisbased piper jaffray amp 
hopwood inc said klms participation in the bid doesnt change 
the proposal which nwa chairman steven rothmeier has described as 
friendly 
laws limiting foreign ownership of us carriers would prevent 
klm from taking a controlling stake in northwest said kurt rivard 
an analyst for dain bosworth inc of minneapolis 
barbara beyer president of avmark inc an aviation consulting 
firm in arlington va said the move may strengthen checchis bid 
because it would allow klm and northwest to strike a working 
relationship similar to a marketing agreement between united 
airlines and british airways 
it would probably make a lot of sense beyer said i guess 
if i have any concerns its that i dont have a feel klm is big 
enough to carry something like that off 
other known bidders for nwa include pan am corp which has 
offered about 110 a share or 33 billion and marvin davis the 
billionaire los angeles investor the size of the bids by davis and 
checchi have not been disclosed but a davis spokesman said the oil 
moguls latest offer is a revision upward from his hostile 
tender offer of 27 billion or 90 a share 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the leveraged buyout specialist 
is also rumored as a possible bidder for nwa but a kkr spokesman 
in new york on thursday declined comment 
hamilton said the prevalent belief on wall street is that kkr is 
a player in the takeover struggle even if it failed to meet the 
bidding deadline of tuesday set by nwas board of directors 
one way or another if kkr wants to be involved theyre going 
to be involved hamilton said 
also making a proposal to northwest airlines is its 
20000member machinists union guy cook president of the 
international association of machinists district lodge 143 has not 
revealed details of the unions offer but in the past he has said 
it would seek to team a patient investor with northwests 
37000 employees in buying a large block of nwa stock 
northwest said it will not identify its suitors or disclose 
proposals four of the airlines board members will review the 
bids which are expected to remain open until june 16 
checchi a former marriott corp executive who has associated 
with the bass brothers investment operations has two other former 
marriott executives as partners walt disney cos chief financial 
officer gary wilson who is a former nwa board member and 
washington investment banker fred malek the group also includes

a dispute over tree top incs stand 
against alar use may have cost company president dennis colleran 
his job a source with the apple processor said thursday 
the companys refusal to accept alartreated apples has angered 
some of the growers who own the nations largest apple juice maker 
said the source who wished to remain unidentified 
the warehouses are choked with alartreated fruit that cant 
be marketed fresh the source said 
many of those growers had hoped to divert the alartreated fruit 
to tree top for processing into juice making less money but 
avoiding a total loss the source said 
but under colleran that option has been closed 
tree top for the past three years has refused to accept 
alartreated apples for its own brand of apple juice in may the 
company also announced that it planned to break contracts with 
growermembers who used alar on any of the coming seasons crop 
even if the apples were not sent to tree top for processing 
in addition colleran has been calling for an immediate ban on 
alar as a way to restore consumer confidence 
alar has been labeled a possible carcinogen by a private 
consumer group but is still legal to use the federal government 
has announced plans to ban alar 
an unknown but apparently large number of alartreated apples 
are still filling washington warehouses and fears are growing that 
many will have to be dumped substantially increasing the estimated 
100 million in losses the apple industry has suffered nationally 
so far this year 
collerans resignation was announced on wednesday but no reason 
was given 
it is a private matter between mr colleran and the board of 
directors tree top spokesman john mcalister said thursday the 
resignation results from differences in management philosophy 
mcalister refused to elaborate and also retracted his wednesday 
statement that the resignation was not alar related he said he was 
not supposed to offer any explanation on the cause of the 
resignation 
colleran declined to comment thursday he said he was 
negotiating his severance package with tree tops directors 
several of the cooperatives board members failed to return 
telephone messages 
public fears over consumption of alar apples have devastated 
sales of both the fruit and apple juice 
sales of tree top juice have dropped over 20 percent since the 
controversy began in february 
alar the marketing name for daminozide is sprayed on apple 
trees to improve the color and crispness of the fruit and to extend 
shelf life federal regulators estimate it is used on up to 15 
percent of the apple crop 
colleran is one of the apple juice industrys leading figures 
serving as president of the processed apple institute and also on 
the board of the national food processors association

opec ministers are getting ready to 
negotiate a new oil production strategy amid price and output 
demands aimed at changing the current cartel accord that has seen a 
rise in world crude prices 
ministers of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries were to gather friday at their vienna austria 
headquarters in advance of their midyear meeting set to begin 
monday 
the cartels eightmember price monitoring panel was to meet 
friday although ministers from the rest of the nations were 
expected to attend 
opecs agreement last november to limit output in order to 
support a price of 18 a barrel for its crude was seen as helping 
push oil prices higher but several members have indicated they 
want to change either production quotas or the benchmark price 
they will come to an agreement at the end said pierre 
terzian editor of the parisbased oil publication 
petrostrategies but it will be rather difficult 
in advance of the discussions several ministers have made 
proposals for the accord that will determine production and price 
levels for the last half of 1989 
saudi arabias oil chief hisham nazer has said he would 
recommend removing the 18 a barrel benchmark 
opec agreed last november to limit cartel production to 185 
million barrels a day in order to support the 18 a barrel price 
although some nations widely are seen as cheating on their 
individual quotas 
prices have climbed since the accord partly due to other 
factors that disrupted some nonopec production some opec nations 
have indicated the output ceiling should be raised for the second 
half of the year 
the government of saudi arabia believes that opec should set 
for itself a production ceiling and strictly adhere to it nazer 
told the new york times earlier this week 
this will give members a chance to take advantage of 
situations where the price goes above 18 a barrel he said 
algerias sadek boussena was quoted in petrostrategies as 
insisting on a target of 18 a barrel for the rest of the year 
the average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by opec 
has skyrocketed from 1234 a barrel at the end of november to 
1767 a barrel last week although it exceeded the 18 target 
earlier this year 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
us crude closed down 9 cents at 1981 a barrel thursday on the 
new york mercantile exchange the near month west texas 
intermediate contract had touched lows in the 1260 a barrel range 
as late as last october 
this years price surge has been attributed not only to opec but 
also to accidents in oilproducing areas such as the oil spill in 
alaskas prince william sound that caused temporary supply 
disruptions 
nick antill an analyst at the brokerage county natwest in 
london predicted opec would lift its production cap by a million 
or so barrels ranging from 195 million barrels to 20 million 
barrels 
some analysts estimate production in april and may was about 
205 million barrels a day 
opec reported last week that 12 of its members supplied 1754 
million barrels a day into the international market last month 
compared with the supply target of 1751 million barrels 
kuwait and the united arab emirates analysts say will be 
pressing for a larger share of the total in a push that could anger 
some of the other members 
sheikh ali khalifa alsabah the kuwaiti oil minister said 
opecs key issues are increasing the organizations production 
ceiling and sharing out the increment among member countries 
the international energy agency in its monthly oil market 
report estimated kuwaits production in april at 14 million 
barrels a day compared with its 1 million barrel daily quota 
the united arab emirates considered a persistent cheater 
produced about 16 million barrels a day compared with its cap of 
988000 barrels according to the oil market report 
the report estimated demand for opec would run about 204 
million barrels a day in the second half of the year 
opec members are algeria ecuador gabon indonesia iran iraq 
kuwait libya nigeria qatar saudi arabia the united arab 
emirates and venezuela

defense attorneys at the securities fraud trial 
of singer co chairman paul bilzerian accused the judge of 
prejudicing the jury and asked him to declare a mistrial thursday 
us district judge robert j ward who has grown increasingly 
irritated with the slow pace of bilzerians questioning by defense 
lawyer arthur mathews denied the request 
although he told lawyers that he had bent over backwards to 
accommodate the defense at times ward later told the jury 
ladies and gentlemen i may have appeared to have been impatient 
with mr mathews i would instruct you that this should not be 
taken as an indication of any view of mine on the merits of the 
case 
the trial the first prosecution of a corporate raider using 
information derived from the ivan f boesky insider trading probe 
is winding up its fifth week 
bilzerian 38 of tampa fla is accused of conspiracy 
violating securities and tax laws and making false statements in 
connection with four failed takeover attempts in 1985 and 1986 
none of the charges involve bilzerians 106 billion takeover 
of singer last year 
bilzerian has been on the witness stand since tuesday mostly on 
direct examination by matthews the defense was forced to alter its 
strategy after ward issued an unfavorable ruling that would have 
helped the governments crossexamination 
since that ruling bilzerians testimony has dealt in minute 
detail with the four takeover bids charged in the indictment 
when mathews said he wanted to complete his questioning after 
the lunch break the judge told him in a loud voice no i want 
you to finish your examination i have kept the jury now so that we 
could conclude it you know we have matters to take up between the 
direct and crossexamination you will finish this please 
later when bilzerians testimony drifted off into a long story 
about how he sought an intermediary in one of the takeover 
attempts ward lifted a book above the bench and dropped it in 
apparent exasperation 
the judge stood up and told mathews if your client couldnt 
know by now that he is not supposed to testify in this way i will 
have to tell him 
ward added i suggest further that you restructure your 
questions concerning conversations and that we not get into this 
narrative i dont think its helpful under the circumstances 
with the jury out of the room mathews later asked ward to 
declare a mistrial saying his actions were prejudicial to the 
defense 
the judge declined and the trial resumed 
under crossexamination by assistant us attorney david 
brodsky bilzerian called a prosecution witness stock trader 
michael landy a liar 
landy a trader at the california brokerage jefferies amp co 
testified that bilzerian promised to reverse a 1985 stock sale in 
order to create illegal tax losses 
i watched michael landy on the stand a few weeks ago and i 
have no problem calling him a liar said bilzerian 
his crossexamination was to continue friday

police arrested three top leaders 
of the small leftist workers party on thursday on orders from a 
judge who accused the party of spurring food riots that killed at 
least 14 people this week 
looters many of them women and children have been sacking 
stores and eating food on the spot in the nationwide unrest despite 
a state of siege the government declared on monday 
the riots subsided thursday but the economic crisis that 
sparked them worsened officials tried to head off further looting 
by handing out free food to the needy 
police arrested jorge altamira workers party president and 
presidential candidate in the may 14 election juan c capurro 
legal representative and octavio camera at government house in 
downtown buenos aires 
the three had gone to the seat of government to meet with 
interior ministry officials to seek the release of party members 
arrested during the rioting 
altamira spoke with reporters before being taken to jail he 
denied any connection between the party and the disturbances and 
said any government claims of a link amounted to ideological 
persecution 
fourteen people died during the riots according to the first 
official count issued by the interior ministry thursday night 
earlier counts made on the basis of police and hospital reports 
indicated 16 people were killed 
federal judge gerardo larrambebere of suburban moron on thursday 
ordered the arrests as well as the search and closing of all 
workers party offices in the metropolitan area 
the judge said his order was based on prima facie evidence 
showing that party activists encouraged in large measure the 
rioting 
the courts jurisdiction includes san miguel and moreno scenes 
of widespread looting and destruction monday and tuesday along 
with major interior cities and other suburbs 
six people died in san miguel and three in moreno after hundreds 
of people many from nearby shantytowns sacked supermarkets 
neighborhood grocery stores butcher shops and bakeries 
several government officials including interior minister juan 
carlos pugliese earlier accused the workers party of being among 
several leftist groups whose members had agitated and 
organized looters

revolutionary leon trotsky ran a partial slate of candidates in 
national elections but won only 03 percent of the nearly 20

ever sold on the exchange 
texaco spokeswoman anita larsen said the shares were bought by 
the investment firms shearson lehman hutton inc salomon brothers 
inc and goldman sachs amp co 
the three companies intend to offer the shares worldwide ms 
larsen said noting that the shares remained under restrictions set 
under an agreement between icahn and texaco in january those 
restrictions were intended to ensure that the stock would not end 
up in the hands of a potentially hostile suitor 
ms larsen said texaco had no further comment on the sale 
texaco stock closed down 212 at 49 a share 
icahn earlier this year was known to hold 166 percent of 
texacos 2443 million outstanding common shares roughly 405 
million shares making him the companys largest stockholder 
icahns profit on the stock deal is estimated at almost 700 
million including dividends the new york times reported in friday 
editions 
icahn became texacos biggest shareholder when trans world 
airlines of which he is chairman bought a 12 millionshare block 
from australian investor robert holmes a court in november 1987 
twa already had owned 59 million texaco shares 
icahn complained that texaco management was not doing enough to 
raise the companys stock price and indicated he was willing to 
mount a takeover of the company which if successful he indicated 
a takeover would lead to the piecemeal sale of its assets with 
proceeds going to texaco shareholders 
his threats complicated the oil companys attempt to extricate 
itself from bankruptcy proceedings and a 1035 billion judgment 
won against the texaco by pennzoil co 
icahn proposed a takeover of texaco valued at 145 billion that 
the companys board rejected he then tried and failed to unseat 
the board in a proxy fight at texacos annual meeting a year ago 
he also fought with texaco over the terms of its subsequent 
bankruptcy reorganization plan the company sought protection from 
creditors to avoid posting a multibilliondollar bond while it 
appealed the 1985 pennzoil verdict which resulted from texacos 
acquisition of getty oil co 
after texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection icahn again 
bickered with management over its plan to sell billions of dollars 
of assets and pay stockholders a special dividend totaling about 
169 billion 
these issues were resolved in the january agreement which 
limited how the takeover strategist could sell his stock and barred 
him from making a takeover attempt against texaco for seven years 
he had been expected to sell his stake since the agreement was 
signed 
icahn declined to comment further so it was not immediately 
known how he planned to use the proceeds of the stock sale and 
special dividend there has been widespread speculation that icahn 
who also controls a major stake in usx corp would make a play for 
that oil and steel giant 
thursdays texaco block trade was the secondlargest in terms of 
shares after the 1986 sale of 4879 millionshare block of 
navistar international corp that block sold for 10 a share or 
4879 million
