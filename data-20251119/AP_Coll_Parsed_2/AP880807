the first national black arts festival attracted 
more than 150000 people to see and hear everything from tap dance 
to classical music to folk art and organizers say theyre already 
working on festival number two 
the 10day series of events which closed sunday with the annual 
atlanta jazz festival drew an enthusiastic response from the 
artists as well as audiences said tom cullen director of the 
fulton county arts council 
organizers had not quite expected the emotional intensity of 
the artistic interest cullen said the evidence of what this 
meant to the artists involved was really moving to me 
it was billed as the first national festival devoted to black 
artistic talent 
i think this one is outstanding because its the first black 
festival and look where it is its in atlanta said tap dancer 
louis carpenter at 76 im just glad to be a part of it 
carpenter and four other members of the copasetics the 
legendary new yorkbased tap dancing group founded in 1929 
performed on saturday to a soldout racially mixed audience of 500 
cullen whose council was the festivals primary sponsor said 
many of the audiences were multiracial 
overall the involvement of white patrons of the arts was 
pretty good since we didnt really do a lot in a special way to 
get white people to come to anything he said 
a mostly white audience of about 20000 saw black classical 
pianist leon bates perform with the atlanta symphony orchestra in a 
park july 31 evenly mixed audiences totaling about 30000 
attended the seven performances of the musical the apollo it was 
just like magic starring patti austin and peabo bryson in a 
tribute to the performers who appeared at new yorks famous apollo 
theater 
many events attracted mostly black audiences as the festival 
organizers had anticipated 
it was important to a lot of local black people to see 
enormously black audiences filling the halls it disproved a lot of 
stereotypical ideas about the cultural interest of the black 
community cullen said 
among the events that attracted large crowds was the exhibition 
of works by sculptor and printmaker elizabeth catlettmora her 
husband painter francisco mora and their son painter and 
sculptor david catlettmora and the play sisters by atlanta 
playwright marsha jackson 
cullen said a second festival in atlanta is already in the works 
the outpouring of interest and excitement was beyond anyones 
expectation he said itll take us two years to effectively 
organize another one then we might be able to do it every year 
the festival was not entirely without glitches choreographer 
george faison who won a tony award for the wiz and directed 
the festivals production of his 1981 offbroadway hit the 
apollo and miss austin had some complaints about malfunctioning 
sound equipment and inadequately rehearsed musicians 
the fox theater is a beautiful barn faison said but it 
takes technical knowhow to pull it off this is a sophisticated 
production that were trying to do on a summer stock schedule 
miss austin who ad libbed we need a new drummer after one 
muchtooslow number said the show was really in a state of 
disarray 
but she added that the production provided muchneeded stage 
experience for young performers and said she hoped the festival 
would be repeated to give these kids a chance to get work and to 
experiment

demonstrators rallied at a city park sunday 
in support of a disabled woman who is at the center of a legal 
fight between her lesbian lover and her parents over custody and 
visitation rights 
sharon kowalski a high school physical education teacher has 
been in a nursing home since an auto accident in 1983 left her 
partly paralyzed and with reduced mental skills 
since then her father donald kowalski and her roommate karen 
thompson have battled over guardianship of ms kowalski whose 
32nd birthday is monday 
ms thompson 40 a college professor said she and ms kowalski 
bought a house together in st cloud about 60 miles northwest of 
minneapolis and considered themselves married 
but after obtaining guardianship kowalski barred ms thompson 
from visiting his daughter who is in a nursing home in the 
northern minnesota town of hibbing 
ms thompson has solicited support from advocates of gay rights 
and the disabled in her fight to have ms kowalski control her own 
destiny 
the minneapolis demonstration sunday attracted about 100 people 
who waved banners reading bring sharon home organizers said 
rallies were scheduled in 20 other cities on sunday 
in new york a dozen protesters placed a wreath labeled free 
sharon kowalski inside st patricks cathedral before holding a 
mass across the street in a monthly protest of the roman catholic 
churchs policy on homosexuality 
ms kowalskis parents from rural nashwauk say their daughter 
never told them she had a lesbian relationship with ms thompson or 
any other woman and they have refused to acknowledge the 
possibility that one may have existed 
her mother della kowalski says she has grown tired of the 
legal battles and simply wants ms thompson and the others to leave 
her daughter alone 
theyre using sharon for a cause she says of ms thompsons 
supporters i dont think they really care about sharon shes 
laying there helpless she cant defend herself 
a duluth district judge last month ordered an evaluation of ms 
kowalski but barred ms thompson from participating 
but ms thompson told the minneapolis rally that even if the 
tests show ms kowalski is not competent to make her own decisions 
the evaluation will break kowalskis control over his daughter 
we are setting the stage for his removal as guardian said 
ms thompson if she types out she wants to see me theyll have 
to let me in 
ms kowalski communicates by typing or gesturing 
karen kingsley a spokeswoman for the national committee to free 
sharon kowalski said the womens plight has meaning for 
homosexuals and the group is encouraging them to obtain legal 
agreements with each other 
lots of gay men are in the same position as karen not being 
able to visit their ill partners even having their homes taken as 
the parents become guardians kingsley said

soviet scientists have discovered reductions of 
the ozone layer over moscow kiev and other major cities a 
newspaper said sunday 
sovietskaya rossiya the newspaper of the russian republic said 
scientists found more than 50 cases of reductions in the 
atmospheric layer ozone is a form of oxygen and its layer in the 
atmosphere absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun and helps 
regulate earths temperature 
the paper suggested a lessening of the ozone layer could be the 
reason for moscows unusually hot summer it called on the soviet 
state committee for environmental protection to begin a severe 
struggle against violators of ecological laws 
it should be pointed out for fairness sake that the ozone 
layer was not destroyed completely some time later its thickness 
returned to normal however the very fact of the thinning of the 
ozone layer is extremely alarming the report said 
the newspaper said scientists working under the direction of 
geographer e basmanov used computers to measure the ozone levels 
it did not say when the measurements were taken how big the 
reductions were or how long it took for the ozone layer to return 
to normal it did not name which cities other than moscow or kiev 
were measured 
reductions in the ozone layer lead to increases in solar 
heating rapid air mass movement and temperature increases it said 
scientists have blamed the escape of freon into the atmosphere 
from industrial processes and aerosol cans as one threat to the 
ozone layer 
ecological damage is receiving increased attention in the 
official soviet press in part because of soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness on selected issues 
the media have publicized citizen complaints about illnesses and 
birth defects they believe to be caused by industrial pollution

american zoos increasingly are becoming a place 
where coopedup humans view freeroaming beasts and many 
institutions are uniting to save endangered species and return them 
to the wilderness 
animals arent in cages any more theyre in spacious 
enclosures in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment 
said charles h hoessle director of the st louis zoo modern 
exhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs 
the trend is evident at the new central park zoo where 
wilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city the 
revamped facility opens to the public on monday 
robert wagner executive director of the american association of 
zoological parks and aquariums which grants accreditation said 
the new central park zoo clearly depicts the latest state of the 
art 
experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes to 
make for example sea lions from the new york aquarium were 
invited to work the kinks out of the new pool and other zoos are 
finding ways to keep their animals entertained 
its quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds on 
the floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied or 
artificial termite mounds with honey or mustard said marvin 
jones registrar of the san diego zoo its a way of easing their 
boredom 
busch gardens in tampa fla was a trendsetter in 1965 
enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebras 
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres in the early 1970s drivethrough 
parks proliferated 
since then realistic settings have multiplied in 1987 the zoo 
associations 132 members spent nearly 500 million building or 
renovating exhibits wagner said american zoos are in their 
heyday he said 
the public has changed due to television primarily people 
are able to see how animals live in the wild and expect no less 
from zoos jones said 
the bronx zoos jungle world a 37000squarefoot indoor 
microcosm opened in 1985 boasts five waterfalls a cloud machine 
100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals including 
endangered bali mynah birds 
in st louis school children and scholars can study ecology and 
endangered species next spring while viewing onecelled animals and 
a living model of a missouri ozarks stream at the zoos new 16 
million 55000squarefoot educational complex 
visitors in atlanta perch on a wooden observation platform a la 
safari to experience the worlds only naturalistic multifamily 
gorilla complex the zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation 
amid grisly stories of animal abuse 
where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage fresh 
bubbling water and open sky it makes us feel a whole lot better 
and as far as i know the animals like it better said gerald s 
lentz zoological manager of busch gardens which boasts 21 asian 
elephants and other endangered species among its 3300 mammals 
birds and reptiles 
such amenities are necessary zoos must breed more endangered 
species while at the same time captivating public sentiment for 
that cause 
while animals arent fooled by fake jungles or fields the 
wildlife settings help provide the visitor with a sense of 
appreciation for the conservation of wild places wagner said 
zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species 
municipal peoples who are furthest from wildlife but who support 
zoos are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role in 
helping to sustain wildlife said dr william conway director of 
the new york zoological society 
the new role of zoos is coming about because there are too 
damn many people conway said within the next 20 or 30 years 
we will lose at the very least 20 percent of the remaining plant 
and animal species on earth 
zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangered 
species such as san diegos california condor program but are 
also educating the public about them 
we dont give a darn if people know that asian elephants have 
the bigger ears and african elephants the smaller ears conway 
said but if they like elephants they may reflect upon the 
meaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys on 
their piano that resulted in some elephants death 
zoo association members share endangered animals and 
technologies there are special breeding facilities operated in 
front royal va by the national zoological park on st 
catherines island ga by the new york zoological park and the 
zoological park of san diego the new york societys wildlife 
conservation international sponsors scientists in 35 countries 
there also is a zoo movement in reverse in november zoo 
association members shipped endangered mynah birds back to bali 
where agricultural development had gobbled their native rain 
forests early reports are that the program is a success wagner 
said 
similar successes have occurred with the return of black buck 
antelopes to pakistan tamarin monkeys to brazil and arabian 
oryxes another type of antelope to jordan he said 
there is no substitute for nature conway said we seek 
instead to be a salesman for nature

americans enjoy no constitutional right to own 
handguns retired supreme court justice lewis f powell said sunday 
it is not easy to understand why the constitutions second 
amendment or the notion of liberty should be viewed as creating a 
right to own and carry a weapon that contributes so directly to the 
shocking number of murders in our country powell said in a 
speech prepared for delivery to the american bar association 
convention in toronto 
copies of the speech were made available to reporters here 
powell whose speech dealt primarily with procedural delays in 
capital punishment cases blamed the soaring us murder rate in 
part on the availability of handguns 
much scholarly debate has centered on the extent to which the 
second amendment applies to private ownership of arms or is 
restricted to the need for a wellregulated militia powell said 
powell said that even if the amendment applies to privately 
owned guns it does not apply with respect to handguns as 
opposed to sporting rifles and shotguns 
the amendment states a well regulated militia being 
necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people 
to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed 
the supreme court has not ruled directly on the amendments 
scope 
powell cited fbi statistics that over 20000 murders were 
committed in the united states last year and that about 60 percent 
of them were committed with firearms 
during the vietnam war some 58021 americans were killed 
he said during that same period in the united states 
approximately 122000 americans were murdered of those over 
70000 were killed by firearms 
about drawnout legal appeals in death penalty cases powell 
said perhaps the time has come for the congress as it is free 
to do to take another thoughtful look at a system that no other 
democracy deems necessary 
he was referring to the system in which a death row inmate 
after exhausting appeals in state courts is allowed to turn to 
federal courts for help 
noting that the time between a convicted murderers crime and 
his execution exceeds nine years in georgia and florida and 
averages nearly eight years in texas powell said however this 
delay may be characterized it hardly inspires confidence or 
respect by the public for our criminal justice system 
he added in view of the unambiguous public support for 
capital punishment one would think the time has come for congress 
to give thoughtful consideration to making reasonable changes in 
the federal law governing review of criminal convictions 
it is now evident that our unique system of multiple and dual 
collateral review is abused particularly in capital cases if 
capital punishment cannot be enforced even where innocence is not 
an issue and the fairness of the trial is not seriously questioned 
perhaps congress and the state legislatures should take a serious 
look at scrapping all death penalty laws powell said 
powell who left the nations highest court last summer 
recently was named by chief justice william h rehnquist to head a 
us judicial conference committee reviewing the capital punishment 
appeals process

whether theyre called 
angels of mercy or vultures of war the men who have 
salvaged hundreds of blasted ships during the iraniraq war say 
they wont stop making money if peace breaks out 
since attacks on tankers began escalating in 1984 salvage 
companies have scrambled for a share of the work once their radios 
crackled with calls of mayday mayday 
despite the danger from air attack toxic chemicals and flames 
so hot that steel ships sometimes melt into the water salvage 
companies persevere because claims on a single tanker can run into 
the tens of millions of dollars 
large international firms like smit tak and wijsmuller both 
dutch firms took the largest share of the work setting up 24hour 
monitoring stations and fleets of firefighting tugs and launches 
meanwhile local entrepreneurs sprang up along the coast from 
dubais port town of jebel ali southeast to the entrance to the 
strait of hormuz 
every man and his dog with a boat and a radio listening to 
channel 16 the international marine emergency frequency could 
become a parttime salvager according to one shipping executive 
iran and iraq are now moving toward a ceasefire in the eight 
year war and if that happens the work will change instead of 
rapid response to mayday alerts the tugs will work on clearing 
ship hulks reconstructing port facilities and dredging neglected 
harbors 
shipping sources say dozens of dilapidated wardamaged tankers 
and support vessels from irans oil fleet may be ready for 
demolition as scrap 
in dubai scrap metal merchants bargain fiercely for recycled 
steel to sell for industrial use in the third world a 
supertankers hull can bring in as much as 20 million 
another prime location for salvagers will be the shatt alarab 
dividing iran and iraq which has been closed since the war began 
lloyds shipping intelligence unit estimates that as many as 93 
cargo vessels and smaller boats are stranded in the shallow estuary 
at the northern tip of the gulf 
the shatt alarab is a potential gold mine said a surveyor 
making plans for a large international company that specializes in 
salvaging ships for refitting or resale as scrap 
walter mckenzie principal surveyor for the dubai branch of the 
salvage association told the associated press once a definite 
peace agreement is signed there should be a dull period of 
assessment of damages of about six months to a year and then an 
enormous amount of business expansion 
during the war salvagers have been criticized because of the 
speed and aggressiveness with which they race to a battered 
burning or sinking ship the first tug on the spot usually wins the 
business 
but the salvagemen defend their role hell yes i make money 
big money said one who spoke on condition he not be named but 
im no vulture he added im an angel of mercy who just 
happens to get paid for saving ships cargos and mens lives 
most shipping sources spoke on condition their names not be 
mentioned just as they have done throughout the tanker war for 
fear of provoking iraq or iran into an attack on their vessels or 
for fear of compromising their business relations with either party 
according to lloyds 546 tankers freighters and small boats 
have been caught and damaged or sunk in the tanker war 
the salvagers make their money from insurers such as lloyds of 
london before the salvage tugs go to work even in the most 
dangerous situations a damaged ships master must agree to abide 
by lloyds open form which says that a reasonable fee will be 
negotiated if the rescue is successful 
it can take years to settle payments which are sometimes 
decided under arbitration although sometimes no salvage fee is 
awarded the figure can spiral to 50 million for a badly damaged 
supertanker 
several tugs have been damaged by air attacks and others have 
been damaged or sunk while trying to make good a rescue 
on january 27 the 740ton tug salverve took the 225668ton 
cypriot tanker coral cape under tow after an iraqi missile attack 
that killed two south korean seamen the iraqis came back blasting 
the salverve and killing its british captain and his filipino chief 
engineer 
in another attack the worlds biggest supertanker the 
565000ton seawise giant on charter to iran was hit by three 
iraqi bombs to one side the 235000ton spanish tanker barcelona 
took two hits on the other side the greekregistered argosy 
escaped the warplanes but was destroyed by fire 
she just cooked in burning oil so hot that she actually melted 
down in the water said one source eighteen lives were lost in 
the attack 
salvage tugs gathered around the inferno of tankers and spilling 
crude oil three days later they were still wetting down the 
smoldering hulks when the barcelona erupted in a secondary 
explosion 
a tug from the scandanavian salvage company scanact vanished 
the vessel and its nineman crew were believed to have been sucked 
into the barcelona and incinerated three men on a belgian tug also 
died and three more tugs were destroyed by fire

us officials concerned about hundreds of 
thousands of refugees in the wartorn horn of africa are sending a 
team to somalia this week to try to figure out what can be done to 
help people 
rebel fighting in somalia on africas east coast has caused more 
than 200000 refugees to flee into ethiopia moving at the rate of 
1000 a day since heavy fighting erupted last may officials say 
ironically ethiopia one of africas poorest countries headed 
by a marxist dictatorship has been a haven in recent months for 
refugees from somalia to its east and sudan to the west 
still there are more ethiopian refugees living in sudan and 
somalia than sudanese and somalis living in ethiopia 
the whole horn of africa is in turmoil said patricia fagan 
a spokeswoman for the un high commission on refugees 
when somali refugees arrive by foot in ethiopia there is 
nothing for them at the camps run by ethiopian relief workers 
fagan said water is scarce and shelters have yet to be built she 
said 
the somali situation for us is confused she said this is 
anxious 
complicating the picture is that fighting in northern somalia is 
occurring near the camps where 370000 ethiopian refugees live she 
said 
the us government has dispatched a threeperson team to 
somalia to find out more about conditions in the remote northern 
part of the pastoral country according to bart kull a spokesman 
for the agency for international development 
because of the war we are in the dark he said their 
purpose is to try to assess what may be needed in terms of 
humanitarian assistance 
the fighting however may prevent the us team from going near 
the northern area officials said un officials evacuated their 
people from the region in june for safety reasons fagan said 
the 7yearold civil war is being waged by the somali national 
movement which is seeking to oust maj gen mohammed siad barre 
the government leader amnesty international the britishbased 
human rights organization recently asked siad barre to investigate 
unlawful killings in northern somalia 
the un has put out an emergency appeal for 11 million to help 
the somali refugees in ethiopia but us officials say they have 
little extra money for them 
as worrisome as the somali situation are recent developments in 
southern sudan where rebels are battling the government the result 
is that 300000 sudanese many weakened by starvation have walked 
to ethiopia to four refugee camps 
most of the people arrive in awful awful shape fagan said 
they go to the camps where water is scarce and food is limited 
because even so they have a chance of being fed the ethiopian 
government refuses to allow un officials or foreign aid workers 
to stay in the camps 
roger winter of the us committee for refugees a private 
group recently visited southern sudan where he said he saw 
starving people hospitals without electricity or antibiotics and 
plagues affecting cattle 
altogether nearly a million sudanese have been displaced as a 
result of civil strife in the south 
policies pursued by the governments of ethiopia and the sudan 
pose a greater threat to large numbers of their people than does 
the renewed drought rep mickey leland dtexas said last month 
at a congressional hearing on the food situation in the two 
countries

official burmese newspapers were quoted 
as saying sunday that five people were killed and an undetermined 
number were wounded during antigovernment demonstrations over the 
weekend 
students in rangoon the burmese capital called for a 
nationwide general strike monday 
the official chinese news agency xinhua reporting from rangoon 
quoted official newspapers as saying police opened fire saturday to 
quell demonstrations in three cities 
the reports said daylong demonstrations in pegu 50 miles north 
of rangoon were crushed when police opened fire killing two 
people and wounding one 
in the central burmese town of yenangyang one person was 
wounded when police fired on about 2000 protesters who defied an 
order banning demonstrations the reports said 
xinhua did not say where the other casualties occured or what 
happened at thanatpin the third city where a protest was reported 
authorities also issued orders banning all public gatherings 
speechmaking marches and agitation xinhua said 
martial law was clamped on rangoon last wednesday after 
demonstrations demanding the ouster of new hardline leader sein 
lwin the capital was reported tense but quiet friday and saturday 
in recent days pamphlets reportedly written by student 
activists have been circulated in rangoon calling for a general 
nationwide strike monday 
soldiers armed with bayonets patrolled the streets of the 
capital saturday as authorities began selling basic foodstuffs to 
counteract soaring prices and hoarding officials and returning 
travelers said 
rangoonbased diplomats have linked the price hikes hoarding 
and other immediate economic hardships to the demonstrations and 
general tensions in burma following a major political upheaval 
sein lwin was elected last month as both president and head of 
the sole political party following the abrupt resignation of leader 
ne win after a 26year rule he has promised economic reforms but 
appears to be moving rapidly to wipe out all political dissent 
just days after his election he ordered the arrests of the most 
outspoken critic of the authoritarian system former brig gen 
aung gyi along with other dissidents and associated press 
correspondent sein win 
authorities also arrested 149 people including a number of 
students in connection with protests last week in rangoon 
official rangoon radio monitored in bangkok said sunday 
authorities had obtained the names of those who pulled the 
strings from behind the scenes apparently at last weeks 
protests and had released 80 prisoners from the citys insein 
prison it gave no further details 
students have been at the forefront of resistance to sein lwin 
whom they blame for ordering the bloody suppression of protests in 
rangoon in march and june 
students first appeared on the burmese political scene in 1920 
when they staged a successful boycott of universities in the 
country they contributed substantially to the struggle for 
independence from great britain 
since 1962 burmese students have led or participated in 
antigovernment demonstrations on 10 occasions including three 
since last fall 
another traditional source of resistance has been the buddhist 
monkhood although in recent years the government has attempted to 
control the monkhoods activities 
rangoon radio said home and religous affairs minister maj gen 
pe myaing met with the chief buddhist authority to urge that monks 
not participate in antigovernment disturbances the radio said 
that patriarch whose name was not given agreed monks should not 
become involved

a beirut newspaper said sunday that 
western hostages in lebanon were held in three locations including 
the iranian embassy under the control of an iranian official 
the addiyar newspaper also said there was a certain 
flexibility regarding the release of british hostages while the 
fate of the other missing foreigners was linked to the developments 
in the persian gulf war 
but the addiyar report also said iran still was insisting on 
the release of 17 proiranian activists held in kuwait for bombing 
the us and french embassies there dec 3 1983 
addiyar which is based in christian east beirut started 
publishing just four months ago its report was attributed to an 
unidentified syrian security source and it could not be confirmed 
syrian and lebanese security officials have long contended that 
most of the 18 western hostages in lebanon were held in the main 
barracks of hezbollah or party of god in hay madi distrtict in 
south beiruts slums 
the foreign hostages in lebanon are divided into three groups 
and held in three different locations addiyar said it said the 
three groups were in the hezbollah barracks the iranian embassy 
and in the sheik abdullah barracks in baalbek a town in lebanons 
east bekaa valley 
it said anglican church envoy terry waite was among the group 
held in baalbek waite disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his 
west beirut hotel on a mission to negotiate the hostages release 
no other names or nationalities of hostages were mentioned in 
the report 
the iranianbacked hezbollah is believed to an umbrella group 
for various proiranian extremist factions holding hostages 
the three locations listed are policed by syrian forces syria 
has 40000 troops in eastern and northern lebanon as well as in 
west beirut and its southern suburbs 
addiyar said the hostages are controlled by a hezbollah wing 
which answers directly to tehran 
irans deputy foreign minister hossein sheikholeslam was in 
beirut when syria sent an estimated 2500 troops into the southern 
slums to quell three weeks of bloody fighting between hezbollah and 
the rival syrianbacked shiite moslem amal militia in may 
addiyar said sheikholeslam managed to smuggle some of the 
hostages from hay madi to baalbek and to the iranian embassy in 
another part of south beirut before the syrians moved in it did 
not elaborate on sheikholeslams alleged role 
there is a certain flexibility regarding the release of the 
british hostages after relations improved between iran and 
britain addiyar said 
but the fate of the other hostages will remain closely linked 
to the developments in the un security council concerning the 
iraniraq war the daily added 
britain said early this month it was reviewing its strained 
relations with iran following the latters acceptance of security 
council resolution 598 which calls for a ceasefire in the 
8yearold persian gulf war 
nine americans are among the 18 westerners missing in lebanon 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press he was kidnapped on march 16 1985 in 
moslem west beirut

a defective wheel bearing was the apparent 
cause of a freight train derailment that started a ninehour fire 
released a cloud of hazardous gas and displaced 600 residents a 
railroad official said sunday 
a preliminary investigation showed that the bearing apparently 
burned off a wheel of one of the trains 113 cars causing 14 cars 
to derail and hit chemical and fuel tanks saturday said brian 
sweeney a spokesman for burlington northern railroad 
missouri highway 79 was reopened for traffic sunday morning 
except for the area immediately surrounding the crash site said 
rob brown public relations officer for the boone county fire 
district 
people who were forced to spend the night in a church and school 
near this eastern missouri town were allowed back into their homes 
at about 11 am sunday after workers had removed anhyrdous 
ammonia from a leaking tank 
the evacuation was ordered after several rail cars caught fire 
when they derailed at about 6 am en route from galesburg ill 
to st louis 
the fire took more than nine hours to contain but firefighters 
kept the blaze from igniting nearly 28000 gallons of diesel 
kerosene and gasoline being stored nearby 
residents were not allowed to return home after the fire was 
extinguished because anhydrous ammonia was leaking from a 
punctured tank the ammonia is dangerous to respiratory systems and 
can cause severe burns said troy fire chief gerald cherry 
several firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze 
but no injuries were reported by residents or the trains crew 
ronnie herrin 49 a train buff who witnessed the accident said 
he heard the sound of metal crashing and banging 
i knew what it was he said you know how people say when 
a tornado goes through that it sounded like a freight train well 
this sounded like a tornado

the environmental protection agency should do 
more to stop ocean dumping and curb pollution two democratic 
senators from new jersey said sunday 
their epas job is to protect the public health and safety 
and they are failing in that job sen bill bradley said on abcs 
this week with david brinkley 
bradley chastised the epa for not setting up a medical tracking 
system that would require hospitals to keep a record of waste to 
ensure that it is taken to a disposal facility 
every week in new york city 500000 pounds of medical waste is 
taken out of the city and nobody knows where it goes bradley 
said with a tracking system you would track that to make sure it 
got to a disposal facility 
bradley said he has introduced legislation in congress to set up 
a tracking system that might be able to prevent a recurrence of 
what happened this summer when medical waste including vials of 
contaminated blood and used bandages washed up on beaches in new 
york and new jersey 
bradleys colleague in the senate frank lautenberg said the 
epa had not used the authority available to it to take steps to 
curb the dumping of infectious wastes 
lee thomas epas administrator defended his agencys record 
weve worked hard both using our enforcement authority as 
well as our funding authority thomas said on cbss face the 
nation as i said the problem is a big one its going to take 
a lot more than just us 
thomas said the result of the epas work is that nearly every 
state has a medical waste management program he said epa is 
applying pressure on new york city to get it to stop dumping 
finally however thomas said local state and federal 
government will have to cooperate to spend the billions of dollars 
needed to ensure that the oceans are kept clean

mechanics reconnected pipes and 
electrical lines on the space shuttle discovery on sunday after 
exchanging a part that caused a computer to scrub a crucial 
testfiring of the shuttles main engines 
the oneinch hydrogen bleed valve and the sensor that reports 
its open or closed position were removed and replaced saturday 
inside the shuttles cramped engine compartment 
everything is going perfectly so far said lisa mallone 
spokeswoman for nasas kennedy space center 
we might set a new date for the testfiring tomorrow if 
everything continues to go well 
still ahead were the tasks of checking the reconnected lines for 
leaks and electrical checks on the engine system including the 
new valve 
the valve which must be closed during engine firing was 
reported by the faulty sensor to be partially open thursday and 
computers stopped the hotfire test 
a successful test is required before the shuttle can be launched 
on americas first manned mission since the challenger disaster in 
1986 no launch date has been set but a launch appears to be 
impossible until at least early october

the oncemaligned zoo atlanta has built a new 
home for its orangutans that gives the natural hambones room to 
show off and feel more at home than they would in a cage 
the key is that the new halfacre orangutans of ketambe 
exhibit which opened to the public saturday provides a place for 
the endangered red apes to climb as they do in the rain forests of 
their native borneo or sumatra 
when they are kept in a cage that doesnt have good climbing 
opportunities they stay on the floor and look like a big red 
rug said zoo director terry maple the way to see a male 
orangutan is when he stretches out hanging by one hand from some 
material that looks like a tree 
the habitat has two tall trees other structures for climbing 
and ropes that look like vines enabling the primates to climb as 
high as 40 feet 
very few zoos have built a habitat that was correct for this 
animal we spent more money on the gorillas than we have on the 
orangutans but i think weve built an innovative habitat said 
maple a primate behavior specialist who helped build the zoos 
reputation for orangutan breeding and research 
the orangutan habitat is the latest stage in a 26 million 
renovation of the 99yearold zoo which just four years ago was 
rated by the us humane society as one of the nations worst zoos 
at that time some star animals died and the us department of 
agriculture slapped sanctions on the zoo for poor animalcare 
recordkeeping 
despite the zoos problems weve had a very consistent and 
remarkable record of breeding orangutans maple said these 
animals have been cared for all these years by dr brent swenson 
and his associates at the primate center 
maple said moving the orangutans outdoors is a natural step for 
the zoo 
once they learn to live outdoors we expect them to be 
climbing positioning themselves high above the public we think 
thats how they should be seen maple said it will be a 
gradual process as they start behaving like orangutans again since 
they havent had a chance to climb very much in captivity

the soviet union and afghanistan warned pakistan 
on sunday about its support for afghan guerrillas but soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the withdrawal of 
soviet soldiers would finish on schedule 
in a few days our divisions no longer will be in 25 afghan 
provinces we dont have any doubts that the withdrawal will be 
completed in the intended term he told the official afghan news 
agency bakhtar 
under an agreement in april signed by the soviet union in 
geneva half of its about 100000 soldiers are to be out of 
afghanistan by aug 15 and shevardnadze said the soviet union 
would meet that deadline 
the official soviet news agency tass released texts of a joint 
sovietafghan statement and the soviet foreign ministers interview 
with bakhtar in kabul shevardnadze returned to moscow sunday after 
a fourday visit to kabul the afghan capital 
both sides continued their criticism of pakistan which 
shevardnadze accused last week of international terrorism for 
its support of the afghan guerrillas 
but the soviet foreign ministers remarks sunday indicated his 
country was not contemplating a change in its withdrawal schedule 
because of guerrilla activity 
the soviet union has said it reserves the right to change the 
schedule of its troop pullout if what it calls outside interference 
continues in afghanistan 
but shevardnadzes statement indicated all soviet soldiers will 
be out of the country by feb 15 1989 the date set by the geneva 
agreement also signed by afghanistan pakistan and the united 
states 
sundays afghansoviet statement accused pakistan of violating 
the agreement continuing to send arms and equipment into 
afghanistan and failing to dismantle guerrilla camps on its 
territory 
the obstructionist line of the pakistani authorities if it 
further continues may lead to the loss by the geneva process of 
the positive essence contained in it in the conditions when one of 
the main parties to the geneva accords does not observe their main 
provisions it said 
this situation cannot but make the soviet union and 
afghanistan draw the necessary conclusions and determine their 
actions if an end is not put to interference in afghanistans 
affairs it said 
it said nothing more specific about what steps they might take 
the statement also called on the united states to pressure 
pakistan to abide by the agreement 
in another dispatch tass said the final contingent of soviet 
soldiers had left kandahar in southern afghanistan and were on 
their way home after the withdrawal of soldiers stationed in 
kandahar and in helmand no more soviet soldiers will be in 
southern afghanistan tass said 
soviet forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 to support 
the promoscow government and remained to fight the insurgents 
more than 13000 soviet soldiers have been killed and about 35000 
wounded in the fighting

josef stalins body should be removed from its 
place of honor at the kremlin wall because of the crimes he 
committed during his nearly three decades of rule a writer said in 
an article published sunday 
the fact that the main criminal of all times and peoples to 
this time rests at the kremlin wall next to lenins mausoleum 
isnt this an outrage wrote alexander veinshtein director of 
cultural affairs for a moscow factory that produces electrical 
equipment 
his article in the latest weekly edition of the magazine ogonyok 
refers to the praise the dictator received in the soviet union 
during his lifetime as the greatest leader of all times and all 
peoples 
veinshteins biting criticism is unusual even for todays soviet 
media which is exposing the repressions under stalin in which 
millions of people died it was the first public proposal to move 
stalins remains from the kremlin wall the highest place of honor 
for soviet heroes 
the body of vladimir lenin who led the 1917 revolution is also 
preserved in a mausoleum at the kremlin wall 
ogonyok said it is planning an exhibition of proposals for a 
monument to stalins victims in october and november at the house 
of culture that veinshtein directs 
an unofficial group collected about 30000 signatures this year 
demanding that officials approve construction of such a monument in 
moscow soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev expressed his support in 
early july 
ogonyok said it also is planning a week of films plays and 
photography dealing with stalinism

the democratic party chief said sunday the 
republican platform would be all platform and no performance and 
he called on george bush to debate michael dukakis three times 
before the november presidential election 
at a boston news conference the day before the republicans sit 
down in new orleans to draft their platform democratic national 
committee chairman paul kirk and us rep william gray 
dpennsylvania said the republican party platform may look fine on 
paper to moderate voters in practice they said the republicans 
have failed to live up to a host of promises they made in 1984 
gray who chaired the democratic platform committee in atlanta 
last month said the republican platform will likely make many 
promises palatable to democrats theyll say were for human 
rights in south africa but were not going to oppose apartheid 
gray said 
in attacking the republican platform the democrats mimicked a 
tactic used by the republicans earlier this summer before the 
democratic national convention the republican barrage came in a 
factfiction format in which democratic promises were compared 
with delivery 
on sunday kirks aides handed out a release based on a similar 
promise vs fact format 
the release said for example that the reagan administration 
promised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later trade 
arms for hostages with iran that after promising to hold public 
officials to the highest standards 242 administration officials 
resigned under indictment scandal or the threat of prosecution 
and that despite a commitment to health care 37 million americans 
lack health insuranceand the 1984 gop platform failed to even 
mention aids 
kirk and his republican counterpart frank farhenkopf 
cochaired a commission that earlier this year proposed holding 
three debates between the presidential nominees and one between the 
vice presidential candidates 
when it became clear that george bush was to be the nominee 
the signals changed kirk said george bush was not going to 
make a commitment 
top aides to bush were quoted recently as saying the vice 
president would prefer only one debate with dukakis the 
massachusetts governor 
but bush said sunday in kennebunkport maine that he would hold 
more than one debate but would not specify how many when or where 
there will be debates and i look forward to them bush 
said but im not the nominee of our party yet and we have plenty 
of time to determine how many where and all of that 
therell be more than one debate but how manyhas not been 
sorted out yet he said 
bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen also said sunday that bush 
planned to wait until he officially receives the republican 
nomination before deciding on a debating format 
kirk and gray acknowledged that the democrats are trying to 
unseat the republicans from the white house at a time when 
unemployment is down and the economy is strong 
yes there are some good signs out there unemployment is 
down economic growth is still strong gray said but he said 
that bush sees that the sun is shining today and he jumps to the 
conclusion that the sun will shine tomorrow and the next day and 
forever 
gray used a bush term in describing the vice presidents deficit 
reduction plan as voodoo budgeting and bushs flexible freeze 
proposal to trim federal spending gray said is flexible frozen 
fruitcake 
fahrenkopf did not immediately return phone calls from his 
office in new orleans where he is preparing for the gop convention

the sandbags in front of buildings were still 
there so were the windows with tape across them to prevent 
shattering in a missile explosion and the yellow signs showing the 
way to the nearest airraid shelter 
but most residents of tehran a city of 8 million seemed 
convinced sunday that these remnants from the last iraqi missile 
attacks in april will disappear before long 
in new york foreign minister ali akbar velayati said his 
government accepted an iraqi offer for direct peace talks following 
a ceasefire in the 8yearold war un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar said a truce could take effect within two weeks 
there were no sensational headlines in irans afternoon 
newspapers which came out before the developments in new york but 
after tehran radio announced iraqs offer 
new developments in un talks for ceasefire said the small 
headline in the ettelaat newspaper announcing that baghdad had 
dropped its demand for facetoface talks before a ceasefire 
iraqi regime under pressure of world public opinion has 
accepted ceasefire read the headline in kayhan the other main 
afternoon paper 
iranians in the street did not seem surprised by news of the 
developments which broke an impasse in un negotiations between 
the two belligerents there were few signs of exuberance 
people were sure the end would come sooner or later said 
said a middleaged englishspeaking businessman iranians know 
very well whats going on in the world perhaps better than many 
westerners 
sure i am happy this will be over at last said hussein a 
young employee of a wellstocked childrens shoe shop who spoke 
only broken english eiradj who introduced himself as a former air 
force officer said it is a good thing it is the end 
speaking only a smattering of english eiradj explained he had 
tried to obtain political asylum in west germany in 1985 but had 
been refused his gesturing seemed to indicate he would not try 
again 
what did the iraqis want in direct talks asked yussuf an 
iranian businessman he arrived the night before his first visit 
home since he left to study in the united states before the islamic 
revolution that brought the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini into power 
in 1979 
do they iraq want to tell us that they started the war they 
were the first to attack the tankers and they used chemical arms 
against our people yussuf asked 
rumors circulated here that the sharp fall of the dollar on the 
black market had prompted several suicides or attempted suicides 
several exchange dealers according to the rumors had jumped to 
their deaths from a highrise building in ferdovzi street said to 
be a center of foreign exchage trading 
the iranian riyal rose sharply against the dollar and other 
currencies because of increased demands for iranian currency in 
hopes of a postwar boom in the iranian economy 
the dealers had hoarded dollars in the belief that their value 
would continue to rise against the us currency when the reverse 
happened in the past few weeks they lost their speculative profits 
the dollar was unofficially quoted at 300 riyals at noon sunday

an long feud between turkey and greece could 
hurt the presidential campaign of michael dukakis with 
turkishamericans worried about how the son of greek immigrants 
would repay some political debts if elected 
vastly outweighed by the numbers and resources of 
greekamericans turkishamericans are feeling as embattled as they 
did when congress imposed an arms embargo on turkey in 1975 to 
punish it for invading the predominantly greek island of cyprus 
their fears are compounded by the surge of political activity in 
the greekamerican community whose estimated 1 million members 
have been galvanized by the prospect of having one of their own run 
the white house 
prominent turkishamericans concede dukakis would probably do 
whats best for the country as a whole but they say his 
indebtedness for the massive support of the greekamerican 
community may cause him to appoint some of those supporters to key 
posts 
my feeling is that dukakis is an honorable man said ayhan 
hakimoglu chairman of aydin corporation in horsham pa which 
manufactures hightechnology defense and telecommunications 
products but dukakis was helped by massive contributions from the 
greekamerican community and theyll make demands on him hell 
be under pressure said hakimoglu 
greekamericans account for between 15 percent and 25 percent of 
dukakis campaign contributions 
with his family and friends hakimoglu said he raised more than 
100000 for bush but he stressed that his support of the 
republican candidate is motivated not only by turkish 
considerations but also by his freemarket economic policies 
turkishamericans have felt secure with the reagan 
administration which has consistently stressed turkeys importance 
as natos secondlargest military force and its strategic location 
as a buffer between the soviet union and europe 
the united states gives turkey 10 for every seven it gives 
greece also a nato ally but with a smaller military force and more 
robust economy 
turkish american leaders point to sen paul sarbanes a college 
friend of dukakis and one of the architects of the 1975 embargo 
against turkey as a potential enemy if dukakis gets to the white 
house 
whether he gets an administration job or remains on capitol 
hill leaders of the turkishamerican community are concerned the 
greekamerican lawmaker would influence dukakis into adopting 
antiturkish stands 
erol ozdemir who runs the only turkishamerican political 
action committee in the united states says he hopes to raise 
400000 in this election cycle for campaign contributions and 
voter registration drives in 1986 his group the assembly of 
turkish american associations raised 75000 
most turkishamericans will support bush because he believes 
in a strong nato and because theyre concerned that dukakis would 
interfere with turkishamerican relations said ozdemir a 
certified public accountant whose father came from turkey 
one of the issues at the heart of the turkish lobbys drive 
since its inception in 1985 has been an attempt to defeat a 
resolution condemning turkey for the massacre of nearly 2 million 
armenians between 1915 and 1923 under pressure from the reagan 
administration and the turkish lobby the resolution was narrowly 
defeated three times 
dukakis has promised to support such a resolution in a letter 
to the armenian community dukakis said the rights of armenians and 
the human rights abuse they suffer in turkey and elsewhere 
cannot and must not be ignored or compromised for reasons of 
political expediency 
turkishamericans are also worried about dukakis policies 
toward cyprus they are concerned he would call for the withdrawal 
of all turkish forces from the island even before a peace 
settlement between feuding turks and greeks on cyprus is worked out 
the question of cyprus long dormant could become relevant for 
the next us administration because the two sides have agreed to 
hold talks under the auspices of the united nations 
turkey itself has stayed out of the ferment in the 
turkishamerican community unwilling to involve itself in internal 
american politics 
all we can hope is that dukakis will be an evenhanded 
president a president of all americans not just of the greeks 
said daryal batibay the no 2 diplomat at the turkish embassy

police searched sunday for three inmates 
described as armed and dangerous who were among five men who 
escaped from a county jail by punching a hole in a concrete roof 
with a 5pound chunk of steel plate 
two escapees from the valencia county jail were recaptured 
without incident saturday while walking along a road 
officers raided a house in belen near los lunas and about 30 
miles south of albuquerque late saturday where the three escapees 
all mexican nationals were believed to have been hiding sheriff 
lawrence romero said 
the three apparently had fled minutes earlier and were believed 
headed for mexico romero said a state police roadblock set up on 
interstate 25 near socorro was taken down early sunday 
romero said police had reason to believe the escapees stole a 
pickup that contained a 3030caliber rifle a 22caliber pistol 
and a 22caliber semiautomatic rifle 
the five inmates got out early saturday by using a piece of 
steel to chisel a hole through a 4inchthick roof romero said 
the steel piece was about 2 feet long 4 inches wide and 
threequarters of an inch thick 
its pretty rotten concrete so it probably wasnt too hard to 
chisel through said acting chief jailer larry askew 
the hole was made in the roof of a small room housing water 
pipes and valves next to the cellblock showers he said inmates 
have access to the pipe room to turn on the showers and the room 
is secured with a small iron door 
askew said it probably took several days to cut the hole and 
that guards did not routinely check the pipe room noise of the 
digging could be covered by radios and televisions he said 
the escape was reported to the sheriffs department at 845 
am but probably took place at about 230 am romero said 
the escapees apparently were being held in one cell he said 
hourly bed checks were made but the escapees apparently fooled 
guards by putting rolledup blankets in their beds to make it look 
like someone was there askew said 
how can you tell me they made their checks and not know 
theyre missing romero said are they saying theyre making 
their checks but not very well 
arrested saturday in southern albuquerque were damien gonzales 
21 of los lunas and tommy cordova 19 of albuquerque said 
sheriffs detective mark esparsen 
a search continued sunday for eleno avila 24 cruz pacheco 24 
and jesus campana 24 all of mexico 
romero said avila was being held on charges of aggravated 
assault with a motor vehicle reckless driving and eluding a police 
officer gonzales was being held on charges of aggravated assault 
battery and criminal damage to property cordova was being held on 
charges of residential burglary and contributing to the delinquency 
of a minor and pacheco and campana were federal prisoners 
romero said he did not have the charges against pacheco and

leaders of the banned solidarity trade 
union federation on sunday urged polish factory workers to 
celebrate the eighth anniversary of the organization 
the unions national executive commission said in a statement 
that the aug 31 anniversary should become an occasion for 
remembering workers rights 
it said deteriorating conditions in the workplace and declining 
morale over economic recovery justified increased demands for 
change 
growing tension over the last weeks in the coal and copper 
mining industries prove that forgetting about social accords 
inevitably creates conflicts the statement said referring to 
workers in the rudna copper mine in northern silesia who have 
accused management of ignoring worker safety 
the miners gave officials until aug 15 to improve working 
conditions and threatened to stage a series of protest actions if 
their demands arent met 
the solidarity statement called on workers to draw up lists of 
wage and safety demands and to press for the restoration of the 
groups legal status 
solidarity was banned in 1981 after martial law was declared 
the government accused solidarity of engaging in antigovernment 
activity 
solidaritys main demand is that the state recognize trade union 
pluralism saying that official government unions do not adequately 
represent workers interests 
solidarity has encouraged factory workers to apply for legal 
recognition so far courts have denied all of the more than two 
dozen requests 
in the port city of gdansk hundreds of solidarity supporters 
sunday held a peaceful rally an opposition spokesman said 
the crowd assembled at st brygidas church a solidarity 
gathering point several blocks from the lenin shipyard the 
spokesman said the shipyard where the union was born in august 
1980 was in may the center of an eightday solidaritysponsored 
strike 
the demonstrators waved banners and shouted solidarity as 
they marched toward the citys train station said the opposition 
spokesman who refused to give his name he said police watched but 
did not intervene

there will be a battle but it will be in court mrs 
collins said we wont stop until they are in jail

would sit and just shine their lights into the house mcdaniel 
said 
another dispute began when social workers were notified that

king hussein pledged sunday that his 
government will fully recognize a palestinian governmentinexile 
if one is formed 
yes i would recognize it immediately he told foreign 
reporters without hesitation just over a week after he began 
severing links with the west bank and gaza strip 
the palestine liberation organization has been considering 
forming a governmentinexile to fill the vacuum left by husseins 
moves but no decision has been announced 
jordan has maintained heavy ties with the west bank even though 
the israelis seized it from jordanian control in the 1967 middle 
east war 
however the king has scrapped a 13billion development plan 
for israelioccupied territories laid off or retired 21200 
jordanian employees there and shut the separate ministry for 
territorial affairs in his government 
he said sunday the option of annulling these measures does not 
exist 
it is not clear how husseins moves may affect the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip the 
violence which began in december has killed at least 237 arabs 
and four israelis 
some palestinians and others have suggested that husseins new 
policy is designed to pressure the plo to make good on its claims 
of palestinian leadership if the plo fails the argument goes 
jordan might be ready to step back in 
asked if he would take drastic measures such as closing the plo 
misssion in amman the monarch said he hoped to see the plo 
offices enjoy the diplomatic status like other missions like an 
embassy 
the kings comment may have been aimed at encouraging a 
plosponsored governmentinexile 
in israel sunday us envoy richard murphy indicated the united 
states had not abandoned hope that hussein would play an important 
role in the peace process 
jordan has been and will remain a strategic anchor for peace 
in the region murphy told reporters husseins interest is 
in peace and i assume his actions were taken toward that goal 
us policy under the reagan administration has relied heavily 
on jordan as a standin for the plo murphy was scheduled to travel 
to jordan on monday 
despite the latest moves the king pledged to give full rights 
to jordanians of palestinian origin and recognize jordanian 
passports held by residents of the occupied territories he said 
both bridges linking his country to the west bank would remain open 
a senior plo official who spoke saturday on condition of 
anonymity said a highlevel plo delegation was due to visit jordan 
on thursday he said the delegation would hold talks with jordanian 
officials on the implications of king husseins latest measures 
on the future of palestinians

i know theyre dead i am waiting for their bodies so that i can 
cremate them 
there was more rain sunday raising the level of the river 
you cant rescue a body in the river at this time of year 
because of the strong current said mubarak hussain a member of 
the state legislature 
the ferry is always overcrowded because people have no other 
way to cross the river he said the nearest bridge is about 65 
miles away 
navy divers were sent from new delhi and residents near the

said several policemen who do not need tickets to ride the ferry 
also were aboard the vessel

among passengers if the ferrys operators tried to limit the number 
of people going aboard

to catch a train to deoghar where the hindu shrines are visited by 
thousands of pilgrims every day

a newspaper reported sunday that a british warship 
came within 10 seconds of shooting down a civilian aircraft over 
the persian gulf last year 
the weekly observer quoting unidentified air traffic 
controllers in dubai united arab emirates reported that the 
destroyer hms cardiff last year targeted surfacetoair missiles at 
a cargo plane 
the ministry of defense said it would not comment on the report 
and the observer reported no comment from the royal navy 
the article follows an inquiry by the united states into the 
july 3 downing by the guidedmissile cruiser uss vincennes of an 
iran air jetliner the united states said navy forces mistook the 
jetliner for an iranian f14 fighter all 290 people on board the 
jet were killed 
in sundays report the observer did not specify the date or 
further identify the cargo plane it said the alleged incident 
never had been disclosed 
air traffic controllers quoted by the newspaper said the 
incident showed the dangers of foreign warships operating in the 
gulf where iran and iraq have both attacked shipping in their 
8yearold war 
the cardiff was on routine escort duty when the cargo plane flew 
over the ship by mistake and the pilot was not linked to an 
emergency military radio frequency that could have been used to 
warn him the newspaper quoted the controllers as saying 
when the pilot did not respond to warnings from the ship the 
observer said preparations were made to shoot down the plane 
antiaircraft missiles were within 10 seconds of being launched 
when a final check revealed the plane was not hostile 
the air traffic controllers also said a us navy warship once 
ordered a british airways flight to change course and nearly caused 
it to crash into another aircraft 
in washington maj alan freithe the pentagons weekend duty 
officer refused comment on the report 
the dubai air traffic controllers said they swiftly 
countermanded the order from the us navy ship and avoided a 
collision between the two planes the observer reported 
a pentagon report blamed the july 3 incident on human error by 
radar operators without combat experience who wrongly informed 
capt will c rogers iii that the airliner appeared to be an 
attacking fighter defense department officials said the report 
also blamed the accident on stress under combat with iranian 
gunboats 
in an april 18 skirmish with iranian gunboats confusing radar 
signals caused three other american warships to believe they were 
under attack by nonexistent iranian missiles

prime minister yizhak shamir warned us envoy 
richard murphy on sunday against the united states making contacts 
with the plo and said it would lead to more violence in the 
occupied territories 
murphy said it is certainly possible to have dialogue with the 
plo if they meet us conditions he was referring to american 
demands that the palestine liberation organzization abandon armed 
struggle and recognize israel 
the us envoy indicated that the united states still hoped 
jordan could play a part in reaching a middle east peace 
settlement despite king husseins decision to sever ties with the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
israels divided cabinet engaged in heated debate about the 
consequences of jordans moves both sides attacked a palestinian 
initiative to issue a declaration of independence proclaiming a 
ploled state in the territories 
shamir said news of the document which was seized aug 1 would 
lead to greater israeli unity shamirs political rival foreign 
minister shimon peres dismissed it as one more paper to the 
world 
rightwing members called for annexation of some occupied 
territory while leftists criticized shamirs lack of initiative on 
peace negotiations 
shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir said the prime minister told 
murphy in a twohour meeting that any us moves toward contact 
with the plo could encourage violence in the occupied lands where 
237 arabs and four israelis have died since dec 8 
the very fact of rumors or hints that the united states may 
talk with the plo can be encouragement to violence and weaken 
moderate elements ahimeir said paraphrasing shamirs comments 
murphy an assistant us secretary of state arrived in israel 
saturday we welcome dialogue with palestinians and it is 
certainly possible to have dialogue with the plo once they have met 
our conditions he said after meeting peres 
israelis and palestinians are currently facing a higher level 
of tension and violence this underscores the urgency of achieving 
a political accommodation between the two peoples murphy said 
after meeting shamir 
later he told reporters jordan has been and will remain a 
strategic anchor for peace in the regionhusseins interest is 
in peace and i assume his actions were taken toward that goal 
murphy travels to jordan on monday 
us policy under the reagan administration has relied heavily 
on jordan as a standin for the plo that policy was thrown into 
question by jordans decision to sever administrative and legal 
ties to the west bank which it lost to israel in the 1967 middle 
east war 
in jordan king hussein told reporters he would immediately 
recognize a palestinian governmentinexile if it were formed 
the cabinet devoted much of its fourhour weekly session sunday 
to husseins moves which were designed to give the plo greater 
responsibility in the west bank and gaza strip 
industry minister ariel sharon of shamirs rightwing likud bloc 
reportedly clashed with peres of the centerleft labor party when 
he suggested annexation of some occupied territory 
shamir was quoted by the londonbased observer newspaper sunday 
as rejecting demands from rightwing colleagues and supporters to 
annex occupied territory saying it would violate the 1978 camp 
david accord 
the accord envisages an interim period of palestinian autonomy 
followed by negotiations for a final settlement 
the israeli cabinet also discussed the draft declaration of 
independence proposed by local palestinian leaders 
without taking a formal vote the ministers agreed that this 
is something which is never going to happen no one is going to 
give it a second look said cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein 
the daily yediot ahronot on sunday published what it said was a 
draft declaration of independence signed by 152 palestinians 
the declaration called for a state based on a 1947 un 
partition plan which would encompass much of israels northern 
galilee and arab east jerusalem as well as the west bank and gaza 
strip 
a different draft obtained by the associated press made no 
mention of 1947 borders calling for a state in the west bank and 
gaza with arab east jerusalem as its capital 
palestinian sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the 10page draft had been forwarded to the plo for approval both 
draft versions said plo chairman yasser arafat would be president 
of a governmentinexile 
shamir told israel television that since most israelis opposed a 
palestinian state the very presentation of the document should 
bring about greater unity in israel 
peres dismissed the declaration as adding one more paper to 
the world no one can dictate to anyone else if there will be 
movement in the middle east it will either be by waror 
negotiations 
hanna siniora editor of the proplo al fajr newspaper 
supported the document saying it would positively affect the 
situation

is it a conflict of interest to own seven 
television stations and tv guide rupert murdoch is about to find 
out 
but his 3 billion agreement to buy the weekly magazine 
seventeen magazine and the daily racing form is just the latest 
deal by a man with media holdings on three continents a dozen 
newspapers a halfdozen magazines and two publishing houses 
murdoch was known internationally before making his move into 
the united states starting in australia in the 1950s he began 
assembling his media empire there and in britain eventually 
acquiring 22 billion in holdings 
he assumed ownership of his fathers paper the tiny adelaide 
news and built from there his wife anna murdoch met him while 
working as a reporter at one of his australian papers 
in 1969 he purchased the sun a londonbased tabloid and 
showed britain the murdoch method of running a newspaper in 
addition to sensationalist stories murdoch added daily photos of 
topless women circulation soared from 950000 to 4 millionlater 
he took over the staid london sunday times 
murdochs early us acquisitions included the san antonio 
express and news a daily newspaper and the national star a 
weekly gossip magazine he owned both when he paid 30 million for 
the new york post in 1976 
once again his style became quickly evident conservative 
editorial stance screaming headlines outrageous stories although 
the post became a severe financial drain its circulation increased 
under murdoch 
and while he lost millions at the post the rest of his empire 
flourished profits for the news corporation ltd his worldwide 
company were 32 times higher when murdoch sold the paper than when 
he bought it 
while running the post murdoch also purchased the village 
voice which he has since sold and new york magazine his 
aggressive posture earned him adweeks 1982 publisher of the year 
award 
in february murdoch sold the post to real estate developer 
peter kalikow 
murdoch moved to manhattan during the mid1970s in 1985 he 
became an american citizen and began buying television stations 
but an enemy made with his stance at the post came back to haunt 
him sen edward kennedy dmass introduced legislation setting 
an imminent deadline for murdoch to end his dual ownership of 
newspapers and television stations in boston and new york 
kennedy during his presidential run in 1980 was hammered 
repeatedly by the post in its coverage murdoch papers also 
delighted in running photos of an overweight kennedy with headlines 
like tubby teddy 
murdoch also developed a reputation as a ruthless handler of 
unions his decision to automate the printing process at british 
newspapers infuriated labor leaders there but murdoch is not 
bothered by that 
you seldom achieve big things in life without making some 
enemies on the way murdoch said in an interview earlier this 
year 
murdoch still owns the san antonio paper his other us 
newspaper holding is the boston herald his efforts these days are 
focused on converting fox broadcasting into the nations fourth 
commercial network 
murdoch has promised to keep looking for new deals 
now youre going to see joint ventures and startups new 
newspapers magazines and television services murdoch promised 
five months before swinging the 3 billion deal with triangle

the nations governors agreed privately to 
keep presidential politics from dominating their annual meeting at 
which president reagan and democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis plan to make separate appearances a source said 
sunday 
also sunday a white house official told the governors that 
state governments are now the center of activism 
frank j donatelli chief white house liaison to the governors 
said that president reagans goal throughout his presidency has 
been diminishing federal intrusion into state affairs 
before the start of the annual meeting of the national governors 
association republican gov john sununu of new hampshire nga 
chairman and democratic gov gerald baliles of virginia who will 
be the next chairman agreed the state executives ought to avoid 
presidential politics 
a source familiar with the discussions speaking on condition of 
anonymity said sununu and baliles then urged their fellow 
governors to avoid discussion of the campaign 
the governors were meeting between the national political 
conventions that selected dukakis the governor of massachusetts 
as the democratic presidential nominee and that will designate vice 
president george bush as the republican candidate next week 
dukakis planned to attend the closing session of the nga meeting 
tuesday and also meet with democratic governors bush had no plans 
to attend the meeting but reagan was flying to the session monday 
to address the governors 
at a news conference opening the nga meeting on saturday 
sununu a strong backer of bush and frequent critic of dukakis 
steadfastly refused to talk about the campaign he said he would 
display tremendous discipline in an effort to steer clear of 
presidential politics 
despite the agreement to steer clear of partisan politics 
republican gov jim thompson of illinois described dukakis views 
on foreign policy as naive at best 
sununu and thompson are among three governors mentioned as 
potential choices for the gop vice presidential nomination the 
other is carroll campbell of south carolina 
donatelli said that as a result of reagans push to give more 
responsibility to the states state governments are now the 
center of activism they make things happen 
donatelli said that through economic growth block grants and 
tax reform and especially regulatory reform president reagan has 
persisted in his efforts to decentralize government 
there was bipartisan agreement that reagan had won the fight 
with the governors over transfer of domestic programs to the states 
gov richard celeste of ohio a democrat noted that in the 
early years of reagans presidency there was bipartisan 
resistance to his proposals to shift responsibility for domestic 
programs to the states 
yet here we are seven and onehalf years later not too far 
from perhaps where the president first thought we ought to be 
said celeste the host governor for the 80th annual meeting of the 
nga 
the first formal sessions of the conference dealt with reports 
on education and rural development 
gov john ashcroft of missouri chairman of the nga subcommittee 
on education said his panel found an amazing number and variety 
of initiatives launched in states to improve education 
cited were programs to improve teacher training and recruitment 
make greater use of communications technology and provide health 
and educational services to poor children 
iowa gov terry branstad chairman of the rural development task 
force told a hearing the time has come for a new national 
commitment to revitalize rural america 
the report issued by the task force called for giving 
communities greater say in the design of aid programs 
branstad said the farm economy had been improving but was now in 
a new crisis because of the prolonged drought 
the full impact of the drought in rural america remains to be 
seen said branstad he said the drought already had brought a 
return of anxieties to many rural communities 
the record federal budget deficits have been a dominant topic at 
governors conferences throughout the reagan presidency 
at the very time that states governments have suffered 
significant reductions in federal funds the federal deficit itself 
has increased said baliles 
if the federal government doesnt have the money to spend who 
will carry out the functions that have traditionally been carried 
on at the federal level asked baliles 
he said it was essential to debate the nature of the power 
relationship that exists between the different levels of 
government 
celeste said the shift of responsibility for many domestic 
programs had not occurred in a systematic way but there is no 
question it seems to me that we are as state governments in a 
position where we have assumed a much larger responsibility

president corazon aquino on sunday 
defended a brotherinlaw who a newspaper said had gained control 
of businesses seized by the aquino government 
she commented in her weekly radio program about allegations of 
corruption in her administration and said it is very clear to me 
it is not really my relatives that they are hitting but me they 
want to erode my credibility 
she also denounced critics who have said her government is no 
different from that of ferdinand marcos deposed as president in 
february 1986 in a civilianmilitary uprising that brought mrs 
aquino to power 
i disagree very vehemently on this she said in the first 
place my predecessor engaged in wholesale graft and corruption 
i challenge anybody to say that i have illgotten wealth 
marcos is living in exile in hawaii 
the presidential commission on good government has seized about 
300 million worth of assets that belonged to marcos his relatives 
and associates they have been accused by officials in mrs 
aquinos government of obtaining as much as 10 billion illegally 
during marcos 20year rule 
mrs aquinos comments sunday were in response to a newspaper 
report that her brotherinlaw ricardo lopa had gained control of 
36 companies seized by the government from benjamin romualdez a 
brother of marcoss wife imelda shortly after marcos was ousted 
mrs aquino said her family owned 60 percent of the companies in 
question but the firms were taken over by marcoss relatives when 
he imposed martial law in 1972 the businesses include shipping and 
construction companies 
in her radio address mrs aquino said that shortly after she 
became president she lost interest in acquiring the shares her 
family had owned in the companies but lopa wanted to buy back the 
15 percent his family owned 
she said lopas proposal to buy back his shares is still being 
studied by the presidential commission on good government 
i think my relatives can get into business without receiving 
any special privilege and you know i have been very strict on 
this mrs aquino said 
it was the second time mrs aguino has become involved in 
allegations involving her relatives 
last year she ordered the national bureau of investigation to 
investigate claims that a sisterinlaw margarita cojuangco had 
received 1 million from an australian businessman in exchange for 
a gambling concession 
mrs cojuangco denied the charge and eventually was cleared by 
the bureau

the british government plans to scrap the private 
broadcasting authority that regulates the countrys commercial 
television the sunday times of london reported 
the newspaper said that a government policy review due in 
november would recommend replacing the independent broadcasting 
authority with an agency that can take more advantage of the 
consumer choice offered by satellite and cable television 
britain has four broadcast television channels all based on a 
tradition that use of the airwaves is a public service accountable 
to the people through the national government in parliament 
two national channels are operated by the british broadcasting 
corp which is publicly funded by fees that television users pay 
annually for the privilege of owning a set 
the authority created in 1955 regulates the other two channels 
which offer a mixture of national and regional programming funded

leaders of the republican platform committee 
predicted sunday there will be no separate sections outlining 
minority views in the 1988 party platform continuing a pattern 
established in the reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984 
gov kay orr of nebraska the chairwoman of the platform 
committee and sen robert kasten of wisconsin a cochairman also 
said the committees final public hearings this week will probably 
encounter controversy on such issues as drug abuse aids rights of 
the handicapped and child care 
kasten categorized the topics as newer issues not fully 
covered in the 1980 and 1984 republican platforms 
aside from those issues orr said we dont see a major 
departure from the 1984 platform which she described as a good 
foundation for us 
the 1984 gop platform opposed any tax increases contained no 
support for the proposed equal rights amendment and endorsed 
proposed constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal 
budget and giving the president power to veto specific items in 
budget bills 
the gop platform committee has been gathering testimony around 
the country for several months the panels seven subcommittees 
will conclude hearings this week by drafting a platform for 
presentation to the republican national convention during the 
events second night aug 16 
we will be able to come to a consensus orr said she said 
she also was making that forecast because members of the 106person 
platform committee have paid attention to the state republican 
platforms 
kasten said the final republican document will be longer than 
the 5200word platform adopted by the democrats at their national 
convention last month in atlanta 
the democratic platform consisted of general principles our 
platform will be very specific kasten said 
vice president george bush the allbutnominated republican 
presidential candidate will testify before the panel monday he is 
expected to urge the committee to adopt a detailed specific 
platform 
other witnesses include conservative spokeswoman phyllis 
schlafly benjamin hooks executive director of the naacp molly 
yard president of the national organization for women contra 
leader adolfo calero dr edward teller the key developer of the 
hbomb and a leading designer of the star wars missile defense 
system supported by the reagan administration an array of elected 
officials from federal state and local governments and 
representatives of various interest groups

republican george bush said sunday 
he will agree to more than one debate with democrat michael 
dukakis but isnt ready to pin himself down on how many when or 
where 
im ready to commit to debates bush said after attending 
church with his family at this seacoast resort where he has a 
summer home 
he denied an accusation by the dukakis campaign that he was 
shying away from confronting his democratic rival 
not only do i want debates but i have to because ive got to 
get him to stand by his record the vice president saidweve 
got to spell these differences out and debates are a good way to do 
it 
in the debates bush said he would hammer home his contention 
that dukakis is soft on defense 
we cant risk the peace and national security of this country 
on someone as unexperienced as the governor of massachusetts the 
vice president said 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said however that bush 
is talking tough to the cameras but is refusing to meet mike 
dukakis in a faceto facedebate 
if george bush wants to debate foreign policy mike dukakis is 
ready she said the vice presidents resume didnt help him 
when it mattered he sat silently by while the administration 
peddled arms to the ayatollah 
bush also said he would tell republican platform drafters on 
monday in new orleans to be a little more specific than the 
democratic platform committee 
bush will be the leadoff speaker before the gop panel 
it was to be a oneday trip bush was to return to new orleans 
where he will be installed as the gop presidential nominee on aug 
16 
i think the country is entitled to know the specifics bush 
said the govenor of massachusetts says he is a liberal says he 
is a cardcarrying member of the aclu the american civil liberties 
union and that didnt come out of the convention 
they masked it they cramped down any discussion of individual 
initiatives mine will be somewhat more specific 
the vice president attended church with 22 members of his 
family who occupied the first two pews of st anns episcopal 
church 
with him were his wife barbara his 87yearold mother dorothy 
walker bush his five adult children and their spouses and his ten 
grandchildren 
we try to get together once every summer bush said this 
is that weekend 
the vice president and his family spent much at his oceanfront 
home taping television commercials for the fall campaign 
speaking with reporters bush said he was not worried about 
recent polls showing him trailing dukakis by 17 or more points 
he blamed the gap on what he suggested was an artifical boost 
dukakis got from the democratic convention theyve had their day 
in sun he said now we will have our day 
he said that he would continue to press dukakis on issues 
its not negative campaigning bush said it has to be 
done and once its done the polls will take care of themselves 
he accused dukakis of flip flopping on a freeze on nuclear 
weapons of mismanaging the budget of massachusetts and of seeking 
to cut the muscle out of our strategic defense 
and said bush he goes down to new jersey and talks about the 
pollution off new jersey and look over his shoulder is boston 
harbor one of the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this 
country 
last week estrich and paul brountas dukakis campaign 
chairman sent a letter to bush campaign officials criticizing the 
vice president for not agreeing to a series of three presidential 
debates and one vice presidential debate proposed by a bipartisan 
panel 
there will be debates and i look forward to them bush 
said but im not the nominee of our party yet and we have plenty 
of time to determine how many where and all of that 
therell be more than one debate but how manyhas not been 
sorted out yet he said 
appearing sunday on nbcs meet the press outgoing treasury 
secretary james a baker iii also declined to discuss how many 
debates bush would be willing to hold with dukakis baker is 
resigning to head bushs campaign 
asked he he had made any progress in narrowing his list of 
possible running mates bush said not really 
however he gave a flat no to one reporters question on 
whether he was considering a ticket in which president reagan would 
hold the no 2 slot

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
said sunday that iran and iraq agreed to a ceasefire in their war 
followed by direct talks he said he would announce a truce date 
monday 
the ceasefire could take effect within two weeks 
perez de cuellar made the announcement after a full day of talks 
with iranian and iraqi envoys 
i have informed the security council that the two sides agreed 
with a ceasefire followed by direct talks under my auspices he 
said after briefing the council 
perez de cuellar said he still was working on the date 
in principle i will announce the ceasefire tomorrow full 
stop he said 
earlier perez de cuellar said a truce in the 8yearold war 
could take effect within 10 days after the setting of a date 
perez de cuellars announcement came after irans foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati told reporters his country would hold 
facetoface talks with iraq after a ceasefire was declared 
security council president li luye of china told reporters 
sunday the secretarygeneral said he will announce the day of 
the ceasefire tomorrow we are encouraged by what he told us 
the council supports him 
the british ambassador sir crispen tickell said after a 
security council meeting what we are focusing on now are 
logistical arrangements that should follow a ceasefire 
tickell asked if there were major problems said its much 
more a question of logistics he said it would be quite 
difficult to organize the uns 250man peacekeeping force but 
believed it could be done in two weeks 
us ambassador vernon a walters said this is another step 
on the road to peace 
hurdles remain the tremendous resentment and bitterness of 
eight years of war but i think in the physical steps in coming to 
the end of war we are moving rapidly walters said 
irans announcement sunday morning amounted to acceptance of 
iraqs offer saturday to accept a ceasefire if iran announced its 
willingness to hold direct talks afterward although velayati made 
no mention of the iraqi proposal 
we accepted the proposal of the secretarygeneral on the 
facetoface negotiations after the ceasefire velayati told 
reporters outside un headquarters after meeting with perez de 
cuellar for more than two hours 
iraqi ambassador ismat kittani met the secretarygeneral later 
and received irans formal reply 
its a very good day i think we are on the road to peace 
kittani said as he entered the meeting as he left he said he had 
a good meeting but when asked if he was satisfied he said 
thats something else 
the offer by iraqi president saddam hussein on saturday was a 
reversal of iraqs previous demand for direct talks before a 
ceasefire and it capped three weeks of intensive efforts by perez 
de cuellar to bridge gaps between the two sides 
iran announced unexpectedly last month that it accepted security 
council resolution 598 which calls for a ceasefire in the war 
but it balked at iraqs demand for talks before the truce 
iraq which accepted the resolution when it was issued last 
year demanded the talks as a test of irans sincerity 
in tehran on sunday iranians in the streets seemed optimistic 
that the war was nearing its end 
this is it said an elderly man in english he refused to 
give his name 
the war is finished said a young man who gave his name only 
as hussein 
the frontpage banner of tehrans principal morning newspaper 
jomhuri islami read iraqi regime retreats politically has to 
accept ceasefire 
the iranian riyal rose sharply against the dollar and other 
currencies because of increased demands for iranian currency in 
hopes of a postwar boom in the iranian economy 
in kuwait defense minister sheik nawaf alahmed alsabah was 
quoted as saying he believes foreign warships will leave the 
persian gulf if the iraqiran war is brought to an end 
it is natural to say the fleets will withdraw from gulf waters 
when the war ends and the reason for their presence disappears 
sheik nawaf told alseyassah newspaper in an interview 
kuwait reflagged 11 of its tankers under the stars and stripes 
and has been receiving escort through the gulf from us warships 
as protection from iranian attack iran accused kuwait of 
supporting iraq in the war european and soviet ships are also in 
the gulf

help efforts to find a settlement to the war

sihanouk resigned in july as president of the resistance 
coalition saying khmer rouge guerrillas were attacking his 
supporters more than 100 officers and soldiers died in such

truce but even to cooperation between his forces and the cambodian 
government 
it is a question of survival he said 
mrs thatcher told a gathering of thousands of refugees 
the vietnamese must go but we must not allow the return of 
the murderous pol pot regime to return no civilized country could 
accept that 
pol pot was the head of the khmer rouge during its bloody 
197578 purges but he was removed from positions of power after

a wealthy businessman made a public plea 
sunday for the release of his wife who was apparently kidnapped 
from the couples home nearly two weeks ago 
annie laurie hearin 72 disappeared july 26 and her husband 
robert hearin found a ransom note at their home that evening 
authorities have said the vaguely worded note suggests the 
kidnapping may have been an act of vengeance stemming from hearins 
business dealings 
like any businessman i have made decisions which may appear 
to others as unfeeling but those appearances are not true said 
hearin reading from a statement outside his home moreover 
those business decisions were mine not my wifes and she had 
nothing to do with them 
my children and i appeal to whomever has my wife to return her 
safely to us he said with his daughter and son standing behind 
him 
hearin is president of the mississippi valley gas co and has 
insurance and bank holdings his worth is estimated at 100 million 
mrs hearin was last seen by a family maid after a bridge game 
she suffers from an intestinal disease that doctors say could be 
fatal if she does not receive daily medication 
the ransom note instructed hearin to pay an unspecified amount 
within 10 days to former employees of school pictures of 
mississippi inc of which hearin is a major stockholder 
the note named 12 men whom authorities identified as disgruntled 
former employees of the company which takes pictures of school 
children 
the 10day deadline expired saturday without further word from 
the kidnapper or kidnappers on the amount or method of payment 
after making the statement hearin did not answer questions and 
mayor dale danks who was at his side would not talk about details 
of the case 
mr hearin felt obviously that he wanted to communicate as 
you know he has been waiting for some time for additional 
instruction danks said he made it very clear at the outset 
that the initial contact and the only contact that had been made 
was very vague for him to understand and carry out 
danks would not say whether hearin has attempted to make 
payments to any of the 12 named in the note

george bush said sunday hell debate michael dukakis more than 
once and bushs soontobe campaign chairman says the candidate 
will be speaking his mind a lot more after the gop convention 
there will be debates and i look forward to them bush said 
sunday after attending church services with his family in 
kennebunkport maine but im not the nominee of our party yet 
and we have plenty of time to determine how many where and all of 
that 
therell be more than one debate but how manyhas not been 
sorted out yet he said denying an accusation by the dukakis 
campaign that he was shying away from confronting his democratic 
rival 
the dukakis campaign was quick to call what it said was bushs 
bluff once again vice president bush is talking tough to the 
cameras but is refusing to meet mike dukakis in a facetoface 
debate campaign manager susan estrich said its time to dock 
the motorboat in kennebunkport and launch the debate in annapolis 
last week estrich and paul brountas dukakis campaign 
chairman sent a letter to bush campaign officials criticizing the 
vice president for not agreeing to a series of three presidential 
debates and one vice presidential debate proposed by a bipartisan 
panel the first such debate would be sept 14 in annapolis md 
as bush was with his family outgoing treasury secretary james 
a baker iii said the vice president will be free to speak on 
issues distinct and different from the administration after 
hes formally nominated 
he also said the chairman of the republican party was not 
empowered to commit the partys nominee and he would tell you that 
he did not make any such commitment 
baker resigning in time to take over as bushs campaign 
chairman when the republican national convention nominates him in 
new orleans next week said bush has already started to develop his 
own individual persona 
at a boston news conference the day before the republicans sit 
down in new orleans to draft their platform democratic national 
committee chairman paul kirk and us rep william gray 
dpennsylvania criticized past gop practice they accused the 
republicans of failing to live up to a host of promises they made 
in 1984 
a statement from the democrats said the reagan administration 
promised in 1984 to get tough on terrorists only to later trade 
arms for hostages with iran that after promising to hold public 
officials to the highest standards 242 administration officials 
resigned under indictment scandal or the threat of prosecution 
and that despite a commitment to health care 37 million americans 
lack health insurance and the 1984 gop platform failed to even 
mention aids 
in new orleans leaders of the republican platform committee 
predicted there will be no separate sections outlining minority 
views in the 1988 party platform continuing a pattern established 
in the reagan campaign years of 1980 and 1984 
gov kay orr of nebraska the chairwoman of the platform 
committee said that aside from a few issues drug abuse aids 
rights of the handicapped and child care we dont see a major 
departure from the 1984 platform which she described as a good 
foundation for us 
the 1984 gop platform opposed any tax increases declined to 
support the proposed equal rights amendment and endorsed proposed 
constitutional amendments requiring a balanced federal budget and 
giving the president power to veto specific items in budget bills 
baker excused bushs underdog position in the polls as a natural 
result of his loyalty to an outgoing administration interviewed on 
nbctvs meet the press he also said bushs pledge not to 
raise taxes if elected is a credible position to take 
he will be seen in an entirely different light once he is his 
partys nominee a bit more free to speak out speak his own mind 
and speak out on issues distinct and different from the 
administration baker said 
in kennebunkport bush said his standing in the polls would rise 
as he pressed dukakis on the issues its not negative 
campaigning bush said it has to be done and once its 
done the polls will take care of themselves 
he accused dukakis of flip flopping on a freeze on nuclear 
weapons of mismanaging the budget of massachusetts and of seeking 
to cut the muscle out of our strategic defense 
and said bush he goes down to new jersey and talks about the 
pollution off new jersey and look over his shoulder is boston 
harbor one of the most seriously polluted bodies of water in this 
country 
baker who led bushs unsuccessful fight against reagan for the 
1980 presidential nomination said bush already begun to make his 
individual stands known 
he cited bushs opposition to suggestions that drugtrafficking 
charges might be dropped against panamanian leader manuel noriega 
and his stands on aids child care energy policies and education 
on the republican vice presidential choice baker declined to 
speculate on who bush will pick but said the considerations are in 
order whether the nominee is clearly competent is compatible with 
bush will not hurt the ticket and will help the ticket 
bush said he has not really made any progress on choosing a 
running mate 
baker who was reagans chief of staff before becoming treasury 
secretary in 1985 said bushs pledge not to raise taxes if elected 
is credible because of his proposals to implement a flexible 
freeze on spending 
the truth of the matter is that this budget deficit has been 
declining a great deal more rapidly than people thought it would 
just by virute of limitations on the increase inspending he 
said and thats the way that we ought to really handle this 
deficit stop increasing spending dont raise taxes

a crowd of 750 people protesting the nightly 
closure of a city park clashed with 375 police officers early 
sunday and nine people were arrested there were varying estimates 
of injuries 
five complaints of alleged police brutality were filed as a 
result of the melee over tompkins square park in manhattans east 
village said police sgt raymond odonnell 
some residents had asked that police close the park each night 
because it is a hangout for drug users and dealers and rowdy 
drunks also legions of homeless people and socalled punk 
rockers who dress in black leather and spike their hair use the 
park at night 
capt gerald mcnamara the neighborhood police commander said 
he had orders from mayor edward i koch not to try again sunday 
night to close the park mayoral spokesman larry simonberg said the 
order referred only to sunday night and to as long as a heat wave 
continues 
earlier sunday detective louis llanes said officers were sent 
to close the park at midnight and people started blocking traffic 
mounted police moved in to disperse and they were hit by 
bottles they pulled back and police on foot were sent in llanes 
said 
then some fires were set the fire department came to 
extinguish them and they were hit with rocks llanes said 
he estimated the disruption involved 750 demonstrators and 450 
police officers 
police were calling people scum twirling their nightsticks 
and the kids were inciting them too but they werent throwing 
bottles or anything said dan kelley 26 who lives in the 
neighborhood 
at one point a loud explosion of fireworks went off behind the 
police line 
at this very tense moment police scattered and some 
demonstrators rushed back into the park kelley said 
then police doubled back and came back the crowd went nuts 
horses were charging in a sense and then bottles started flying 
people started getting hit by billy clubs i ran across the street 
i was really afraid of getting trampled he said 
an entire neighborhood was terrorized added sharon breslau 
who has lived a half block from the park for the past eight years 
there was no time for what where excuse me whats your badge 
number it was a riot 
ms breslau 30 watched the action from her house there were 
hundreds of people running for their lives 
she said the brigade of police came right up on the sidewalk 
and knocked people down with their horses 
ms breslau said she witnessed three or four officers knock one 
man down and hit him with their billy clubs 
at that point i lost my mind i started screaming dont hit 
people dont hit people as loud as i could this happened five 
feet from me 
it was the second such incident at tompkins square 
early the previous sunday in response to residents complaints 
police went to the park after midnight and asked a rock band to 
stop playing 
they were responsive but a small percentage of the spectators 
became agitated and began throwing bottles at police llanes 
said four people were arrested and five officers injured in that 
disturbance llanes said 
all of the injuries this week also were basically minor 
said capt william olsen of the emergency medical service 
olsen said 13 civilians and five police officers were injured 
the police department had slightly different figures llanes 
said seven officers were injured and nine civilians 
a spokesman at beth israel hospital located near the park said 
28 people walked in on their own seeking treatment 
odonnell said there had been nine arrests six of those on 
riot and assault charges both felonies the other arrests were for 
disorderly conduct and other misdemeanors 
all city parks technically close at 1 am said gary zarr 
spokesman for the parks department but curfews are actively 
enforced at only two manhattan parks washington square and 
stuyvesant park 
some members of the community asked for the curfews because 
there was a lot of antisocial activity going on in those two 
parks zarr said stuyvesant has a fence so the parks 
department could literally close the gates but most parks however 
dont have gates so they are open passage areas where people can 
enter at night

a vietnamese newspaper criticized the 
united states sunday saying it linked the establishment of 
diplomatic relations with demands that vietnam account for missing 
us servicemen 
the communist party daily nhan dan said the united states must 
bear full responsibility for the obstacles it has set up in the 
process of settling the issue of americans missing in action in the 
vietnam war and other humanitarian questions 
the united states lists more than 1700 american servicemen as 
missing in action or mia in vietnam 
last week vietnam said it halted cooperation on the mia issue 
and on the resettlement in america of former prisoners of 
reeducation camps most of those prisoners were sent to the camps 
after communist forces defeated the usbacked south vietnamese 
government in april 1975 
vietnam earlier expressed anger at the us state departments 
criticism of a congressional resolution calling for establishment 
of interest sections lowlevel diplomatic missions in 
washington and the vietnamese capital of hanoi 
the state department urged continuing the policy of isolating 
vietnam until it withdraws its estimated 100000 military personnel 
from cambodia vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted 
the radical khmer rouge regime that had ruled since the spring of 
1975 and installed another communist government when vietnam 
suspended cooperation on the issue of mias and former vietnamese 
political prisoners washington claimed the vietnamese had broken a 
promise not to link the question of diplomatic ties with 
humanitarian matters 
the nhan dan article carried by the vietnam news agency 
monitored in bangkok said it was vietnams consistent policy not 
to link humanitarian with political issues 
it said the us side has also agreed to do this but in fact 
it has violated this agreement 
time and again the us administration has linked the mia 
question with the normalization of of usvietnamese relations 
nhan dan said in his statement in hawaii on july 21 us 
secretary of state george shultz connected the normalization of 
the two countries relations with an acceptable kampuchea 
cambodia and the settlement of the mia issue 
it said the united states rejected vietnams proposal for 
resettlement of the former reeducation camp inmates and 
responsible officials in washington have voiced hostility towards 
vietnam

scientists on sunday said 
their first dive to the bottom of the nations deepest lake was 
exciting but they didnt find any evidence of the thermal springs 
they were seeking 
jack dymond and robert collier oceanographers at oregon state 
university each used a oneperson submarine to search crater lake 
for hot springs that may be the remnants of the volcanic activity 
that formed the lake nearly 7000 years ago 
we havent found any actual thermal springs said dymond 
who friday became the first man to reach the bottom of the lake 
in some ways were just getting started i think in the next week 
or 10 days well be much further along 
the oceanographers are taking part in a national park service 
research project to determine why the lake is so clear visibility 
in the lake has been measured to a depth of between 85 and 115 feet 
the study was started after scientists in the 1970s noticed a 
significant reduction in the clarity of the lake recent 
measurments have shown the clarity returning to levels last 
measured in the 1930s 
the deepest point in the lake is 1932 feet making it the 
seventhdeepest lake in the world the lake is in southwestern 
oregon 
collier who made his first dive saturday said it took about 20 
minutes to reach the bottom and at a depth of 1200 feet blue 
light was still visible from above 
dymond likened the bottom to a moonscape with 2foot diameter 
boulders and rock walls and ridges he said he also saw what he 
interpreted to be evidence of old hot springs deposits of iron 
and manganese and rock formations with colored stains on holes or 
cracks 
while the submarine operated well sonar echos off unexpectedly 
craggy features on the bottom of the lake made precise navigation 
difficult and efforts are being made to correct the problem the 
scientists said 
we can only tell where we are every five minutes collier 
said id like to know every minute 
precise navigation is important last year while using a 
remotecontrolled submersible equipped with a video camera the 
scientists stumbled across what looked like a vent oozing a milky 
substance however they never were able to relocate it to take a 
temperature reading or a fluid sample 
crater lake was formed after rain and melted snow filled the 
basin left by the collapse of mount mazama in the cascade range 
nearly 7000 year ago 
both dymond and collier said they experienced brief moments of 
fear during their descent but quickly became engrossed in their 
work 
collier said much of what he saw was sediment covering the 
bottom with wavy markings that may have been worm tubes he said 
he also saw small rocks and sunken pieces of trees that were 
probably rafted out to the interior of the lake by ice as well as 
an angular object apparently made by man that could have been 
dropped off a tour boat 
i pretty much saw the same thing for five hours collier 
said

the district attorneys office has ordered an 
internal review of a superior court judge who declared a mistrial 
in a drug case when it conflicted with a convention he planned to 
attend officials said 
judge stephen lachs 48 said attorneys assured him the trial 
would end aug 3 a day before he was to leave for an american bar 
association convention in toronto where he was to preside over a 
meeting of the family courts committee 
lachs appointed to the court in 1979 said from toronto on 
friday he hoped the defendant could be tried again but said both 
the prosecutor and the defense attorney knew of his time constraint 
i had my plans to be at the aba annual meeting and that 
was it lachs said 
but chief deputy district attorney gilbert i garcetti claimed 
the defendant will be set free because the mistrial was declared 
before the jury ruled on her guilt or innocence 
the internal review could lead to a request by the district 
attorneys office for an investigation by the state commission on 
judicial performance which evaluates allegations of impropriety 
and makes recommendations to the state supreme court 
a criminal defendant cannot be tried twice for the same offense 
and such constitutional protection takes effect as soon as a jury 
is sworn in 
the only exceptions are when one of the lawyers the judge or 
the defendant becomes ill or when there is a hung jury in such 
cases a new trial is generally scheduled 
the jury in the case before lachs was sworn in tuesday and ready 
to hear final arguments wednesday afternoon in a trial for felony 
possession of about one gram of rock cocaine

the soviet union after refraining for months 
from sending nuclear submarines to stations off americas east 
coast resumed the patrols early this summer and appears to be 
continuing them defense officials say 
the officials who agreed to discuss the matter only if not 
identified disclosed last week that a lone soviet yankee sub 
reappeared during the first week of june inside an atlantic patrol

energy secretary john s herrington has 
announced a preferred buyer for its great plains coal gasification 
plant in north dakota in a deal that could mean 18 billion for 
the government over the next 21 years 
basin electric power cooperative based in bismarck nd was 
selected from among nine prospective purchasers who bid for the 
plant which was built in the early 1980s and acquired by the 
energy department in 1985 when its private sponsors defaulted on 
nearly 15 billion in federal loans 
our announcement signals the successful return of a facility 
to the private sector after the largest foreclosure in us 
government history herrington said at a briefing friday almost 
exactly three years after the department acquired the plant 
it turns the further drain on the taxpayer that we faced three 
years ago into a substantial recoupment of the taxpayers money 
he said 
basin electric is a consumerowned regional cooperative that 
supplies wholesale electric power to 118 rural electric systems in 
eight states it is expected to retain the majority of the more 
than 800 employees now operating the plant the energy department 
said in a statement 
before the transfer of title can take place the energy 
department must forward a detailed description of the sales terms 
to congress for a mandated 30day review 
the offer from basin electric removes the government from 
future subsidies and future liabilities herrington said we 
have an offer that removes the government from competing in the 
business of producing commercial quantities of fuels and one that 
puts business decisions back in the hands of businessmen 
the 18 billion value to the government according to the 
department statement would be in dollars valued at the time they 
are received the initial cash payment would be approximately 85 
million 
an additional 105 million would be returned from the projects 
cash reserve fund 649 million could result from future profit 
sharing if energy prices follow projections 590 million would 
result from the waiver of some federal tax credits available to the 
project and 367 million would be received as federal income taxes 
the department said the actual value will vary with inflation 
and gas prices and the departments views of those factors and 
discount rates gives the basin electric offer a current value of 
600 million 
in addition to basin electric the department entered serious 
negotiations with two other prospective buyers the coastal corp 
the parent company of one of the original plant owners and mission 
first financial a subsidiary of southern california edison 
the other six companies that submitted offers were beta 
pipeline and equipment inc fhn energy inc industrial 
engineering services irving a backman complete energy petroleum 
inc and the three affiliated indian tribes of the fort berthold

ron gerhardt says the upturn in the 
aluminum industry can be measured in the extra bales of beer and 
sodapop containers coming through the doors of his evansville 
recycling business 
us aluminum makers buoyed by high prices and a worldwide 
shortage of products mostly have recovered from the depths of a 
slump two years ago and are posting record profits 
tzschoppe industries recycling sends more than 10000 pounds of 
aluminum per week to aluminum company of americas nearby warrick 
operations the largest aluminum smelter in the united states 
recycling started kind of as an oddity but now its getting 
to be the normal thing to do said gerhardt company president 
the aluminum turnaround is welcome news in the lower ohio 
valley where major aluminum producers lured to the region by 
plentiful coal supplies and excellent river transportation have 
put three smelters within a 40mile radius the plants represent 
about 16 percent of the countrys aluminum smelting capacity 
pittsburghbased alcoa is completing a fouryear 300 million 
modernization at the southern indiana plant a similar program is 
under way at the companys alcoa tenn smelter just outside of 
knoxville 
other nearby smelters include nationalsouthwire aluminum in 
hawesville ky and alcan aluminum in sebree ky where 155 
million in plant improvements have begun the company shut down 
four production lines in 198586 
aluminum was going down the same path as steel was in the 
1980s said mike deshaies alcoa spokesman in indiana so we 
started cutting back the highcost lowprofit end of the 
business 
alcoa the nations largest producer announced a 25 percent 
reduction in smelting capacity three years ago and other producers 
took similar steps closing less efficient plants and idling 
production lines 
the industry was trimming down to fighting weight so to 
speak said frank rathbun spokesman for the aluminum association 
in washington 
foreign countries with large reserves of raw material or 
electric power a major cost component of aluminum could produce 
the metal more cheaply 
but recovering aluminum prices up from about 40 cents per pound 
two years ago to around 120 in late july have generated record 
profits for some of the major producers 
alcoa reported profits of 2001 million or 225 per share on 
sales of 777 billion for all of 1987 and profits of 4163 
million or 471 per share on sales of 459 billion in the first 
six months of this year 
reynolds of richmond va reported 1987 net earnings of 2195 
million or 433 per share on sales of 432 billion and net 
earnings of 2049 million or 384 per share on revenue of 265 
billion in the 1988 first half 
labor unions that agreed to concessions during the slump also 
have noticed the boom times and will be looking to share in the 
profits when they negotiate their next contract 
the current twoyear pacts with the united steelworkers of 
america and the aluminum brick and glass workers international 
union lowered benefits by 95 cents per hour for their members at 
aluminum company of america and reynolds metals co 
talks on a new contract are scheduled to begin monday in 
cincinnati the old pacts expire may 31 1989 
this is a very good time from the standpoint of bargaining 
said larry e sigler president of local 104 which represents 
workers at the newburgh plant 
while celebrating the boom industry leaders are cautious about 
competition from steel producers and also warn that metal prices 
are cyclical 
a weakening of the western economies that use aluminum in 
housing containers and construction could send prices tumbling 
again no one knows how long the good times will last 
if you find 15 aluminum analysts in new york who want to talk 
to you about whats happening youll come up with 17 different 
explanations said alcan spokesman stan lampe

two decades after a feisty young company set 
out to make a place for itself in the longdistance telephone 
market mci communications corp has survived the rites of passage 
into corporate adulthood 
mci long considered a brassy and freewheeling risktaker has 
honed its management style and developed a strategy that has made 
it a 5 billion company and the major longdistance competitor of 
industry leader american telephone amp telegraph co 
they are a fullservice firm that can compete on all fronts 
with atampt said jack grubman a telephone analyst with 
painewebber inc the growing up and pains associated with that 
are for the most part behind them and theyre looking at a long run 
of pretty healthy growth ahead 
mci surprised analysts last month when it reported a ninefold 
increase in secondquarter profits confirming the selfconfidence 
it displayed a week before when it announced it would buy back the 
162 percent stake held by international business machines corp 
in the quarter that ended june 30 mci reported record net 
income of 73 million on record revenues of 12 billion 
strengthened by increased sales of 800 and international services 
and the continued signing up of large corporate accounts 
mci chairman william g mcgowan who on aug 8 1968 founded 
the company that became mci also sees good things ahead for his 
company but only with continued hard work and long hours not 
even time out for a birthday celebration 
i think the challenge is always in front of us mcgowan said 
in an interview last week as the company quietly closed out its 
20th year in business rates for mcis various services are from 5 
percent to 15 percent below those of atampt mcgowan says 
its a tough competitive industry and weve got to stay tough 
and fresh and look at it as a challenge every day he said 
the meek may inherit the earth but they wont increase 
market share mcgowan said 
that attitude is what has driven mci whose pioneer effort to 
compete in the longdistance industry influenced the governments 
decision to break up the atampt telephone monopoly 
mci first took on atampt in 1969 when it received government 
approval to establish a microwave link between chicago and st 
louis to serve companies that had offices in both cities it 
attracted customers to its tiny network with promises of savings 
over atampt and over the next decade the network grew as mcgowan 
persistently attacked the telephone monopoly in the courts and 
before government regulators 
in 1980 mci began offering residential longdistance service 
but not until after the atampt divestiture in january 1984 was the 
company able to offer customers the same easy 1plus dialing that 
atampt could offer the consent decree stripped atampt of its local 
operating companies and required them to begin offering 
longdistance companies the same connection to the local networks 
as atampt had long enjoyed 
though mci is growing stronger the company continues to lobby 
strongly before the courts the federal communications commission 
and the congress for protection from atampt 
competition in the 50 billionayear longdistance industry 
will thrive as long as atampt is not free to use its size to undercut 
the opposition and drive competitors out of business mci argues 
but atampt says mci wants it both ways it wants to appear to 
shareholders as a strong confident stateofthe art network but 
it wants to appear to regulators as a struggling vulnerable 
upstart 
theyre trying to carry water on both shoulders said 
lawrence garfinkel atampt vice president for marketing a 5 
billion company larger than many other firms isnt going to be 
put out of business 
atampt has been trying to persuade regulators the courts and 
congress to loosen the regulatory reins on the company to allow it 
to compete more freely and with more flexibility in a thriving 
industry only atampt is subject to regulations 
its no longer a davidandgoliath syndrome garfinkel said 
they are a fullfledged competitor in the marketplace and the 
whole thrust of the market now is alternative competitors 
atampt had 72 percent of the market last year followed by mci 
with 93 percent and us sprint communications co with 56 percent 
according to the yankee group a bostonbased consulting firm 
in contrast to mcis financial success us sprint has lost 176 
billion since it was formed in july 1986 as a joint venture of gte 
corp and united telecommunications inc 
analysts have watched closely as mci has staged a steady 
comeback from a tumultuous 1986 when profits were disappearing 
behind price cuts it had to make to keep rates below atampts mci 
cut staff by 15 percent and took a 550 million writeoff of network 
assets ending 1986 with a 448 million loss 
in the winter of 1987 with mcgowan sidelined by a heart attack 
company executives conducted a soulsearching that developed a 
corporate strategy designed to lift mci out of the doldrums and 
refocus the company as a fullservice company not just a niche 
player 
mcgowan who underwent heart transplant surgery that spring 
returned to his desk and by the third quarter of that year the plan 
was producing results costs were down and the company was making 
inroads into corporate accounts and boosting its share of the 
longdistance market 
mcgowan said the prescription for corporate success is a 
youthful spirit that can accommodate change especially in an 
industry that has been turned inside out by regulatory changes and 
technological advances 
we have to make sure that we institutionalize change 
mcgowan said the normal tendency is to institutionalize the 
status quo we should challenge the status quo and i would worry if 
we dont

iran said sunday it was determined to 
play its part in achieving unity among members of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries tehran radio reported 
the radio report monitored by british broadcasting corp said 
oil minister golamreza agazadeh made the comment during a meeting 
with a delegation of officials from oman 
the achievement of a sincere unity in the decisions taken by 
opec requires great effort and cooperation by all the members 
agazadeh was quoted as saying 
we are determined to play our role in achieving this goal 
he said 
some opec leaders have expressed hope that a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war could help boost oil prices 
during the war iran has been discounting its oil and iraq has 
been producing far more than under its last official opec output 
quota in addition disagreement by the two war enemies over how 
large a quota the other should have has worsened attempts by the 
fractious cartel to reach consensus on how best to raise oil prices 
the theory is that if the war ends iran and iraq will be more 
disciplined 
the world oil cartel has been attempting to raise the average 
price of crude to 18 per 42gallon barrel recently world prices 
have been at least 1 to 2 below that level

energy companies with money to spend are snapping 
up oil and gas reserves instead of sinking wells to find new 
reserves experts say 
new oil and gas discoveries have dwindled because of high 
exploration costs but there are plenty of reserves for sale 
there are more reserves on the market now than there have ever 
been said houston consultant bill strevig as an informed 
guess id say there is double what there was a year or two ago 
strevig he calculated saturday that reserves worth an estimated 
23 billion changed hands during the second quarter and he expects 
a barrage of sales before 1988 is over 
tenneco inc and texaco inc have the largest blocks of 
properties on the market with a combined price tag that analysts 
say is in the neighborhood of 6 billion analysts estimate that 
dozens of other companies have properties worth an additional 15 
billion on the market 
consultants analysts and the companies that are gobbling up the 
reserves say current prices range from 5 to 550 a barrel for oil 
and 80 cents to 1 per thousand cubic feet for natural gas 
although some buyers recently have paid more 
the industry historically has valued reserves at about onethird 
the price at the wellhead so with west texas intermediate crude 
selling at a little over 15 a barrel the market prices of 5 and 
550 are on target if oil and gas prices remain flat in the next 
few years strevig said 
according to a recent study by the accounting and consulting 
firm arthur andersen amp co the cost of drilling new wells is in 
the range of 6 to 8 a barrel so it is cheaper and less risky to 
buy oil that already has been drilled 
industry experts give several reasons for selling reserves but 
the one most often cited is the sellers need to reduce debt 
they look at their assets and say to themselves what do we 
want to sell said clyde buck senior vice president with 
rauscher pierce refsnes inc 
then they ask what can we get for this assets today versus 
three to five years from now 
for years companies generally had held on to their reserves 
thinking the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
eventually would succeed in driving up world energy prices and 
thus the value of their properties 
the price of oil could go up dramatically but gee whiz it 
just doesnt look like theres a high probability of that buck 
said so companies are dumping properties and putting the proceeds 
into debt reduction programs and into other business sectors they 
believe have more potential he said 
energy companies are not the only ones buying reserves bill 
padek of geodyne resources in tulsa okla said that income 
partnership funds like his and other institutional investors such 
as insurance companies and pension funds have been buying reserves 
energy reserve investments are suited to those organizations he 
said because current prices are relatively low and pension funds 
can afford to hold an investment with a 10 to 20year scope
