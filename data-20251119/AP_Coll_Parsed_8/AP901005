jesse helms the archduke of senate 
conservatives is battling the state department again and his 
private war is gumming up president bushs diplomacy 
this is a tale of three diplomats who want to be ambassadors but 
whose careers have gotten tangled up in a mixture of senate 
politics and personal grudges 
a fourth candidate lost out when his nomination was withdrawn as 
the result of objections from the host country 
helms rnc is angry at the administration over its 
nomination of george fleming jones as ambassador to the tiny south 
american state of guyana 
helms suspects jones of involvement in the 1986 leak of a secret 
chilean military report about the death of an american during a 
violent protest in santiago according to a source who asked not to 
be identified 
helms was infuriated when his own office was blamed for the 
leak he has told the state department that unless it provides 1986 
cables from the us embassy in chile where jones was posted he 
would keep blocking the confirmation the source said 
helms parliamentary maneuvering to block a senate committee 
hearing on jones nomination also wound up delaying confirmation 
hearings for two other ambassadorial nominees g philip hughes 
for barbados and john p leonard for suriname 
while the appointments arent highlevel they illustrate the 
convoluted dealings of the senate and the protracted nature of the 
confirmation process the administration submitted the nominees 
names several months ago and the diplomats may have to wait until 
the new congress convenes next year before their cases are 
resolved 
helms is an old hand at manipulating ambassadorial nominations 
using them as bargaining chips in wheeling and dealing with 
colleagues and the administration the 68yearold standardbearer 
of anticommunism is running for a fourth senate term neckandneck 
against democrat harvey gantt 
one of his betterknown maneuvers was a sixmonth hold on 
the 1987 nomination of april glaspie to become ambassador to iraq 
he took to the senate floor last month to say his objections had 
been vindicated 
glaspie has come in for stinging criticism over her failure to 
tell iraqi president saddam hussein that the united states was 
angry about his threats against kuwait having reported to 
washington that there was no cause for concern she left on 
vacation a day before the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
sen christopher dodd dconn is upset at helms delay 
tactics according to a congressional source who demanded 
anonymity but hes even more angry at the administration for 
nominating hughes 
hughes served as secretary of the presidents national security 
council during the irancontra affair dodd wants to ask him 
whether he knew that nsc aide oliver north was illegally arranging 
to give the nicaraguan contra rebels money from us arms sales to 
iran 
dodd also objected last year to the nomination of hughes boss 
donald gregg to be ambassador to south korea dodd contended that 
gregg knew of norths doings but gregg eventually was approved 
the fourth nomination frederick vreeland to be ambassador to 
burma is being withdrawn the state department said thursday 
night 
a state department official who asked not to be identified 
said vreelands name is being withdrawn because of objections from 
the military authorities of burma about prodemocracy statements 
vreeland had made during senate testimony 
but vreelands nomination had been in trouble from the start 
sen alfonse damato rny had asked helms to block a vote on 
his confirmation and helms obliged 
damato who isnt a member of the foreign relations committee 
and some committee members were furious at the state department 
for representing vreeland as a foreign service officer at a time 
when he worked undercover for the cia 
vreeland by the way is the son of the late vogue magazine 
editor diana vreeland 
some of vreelands conservative critics also questioned why 
while serving at the us embassy in rome vreeland played down the 
role of soviet and bulgarian intelligence in the 1981 assassination 
attempt of pope john paul ii

a fundraiser hosted by savings and loan 
operator charles h keating jr plays a major role in a 
recommendation that an ethics investigation proceed against sen 
donald w riegle jr say sources familiar with the inquiry 
just weeks after the march 23 1987 fundraiser for riegle the 
michigan democrat and four senate colleagues met with us banking 
regulators on behalf of keating a political donor to all five 
the senate ethics committee is trying to establish whether any 
of the five senators were influenced to help keating by the 13 
million he and associates donated to the lawmakers campaigns and 
causes 
congressional sources previously confirmed that special counsel 
robert s bennett had recommended that the investigation continue 
against riegle and sens alan cranston dcalif and dennis 
deconcini dariz 
bennett also proposed that sens john mccain rariz and john 
glenn dohio be dropped from the investigation 
the committee now is at a juncture where it can advance some or 
all the cases to expanded levels of inquiry including public 
hearings or dismiss senators from the probe 
congressional sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
earlier this week that any links between the senators actions and 
the timing of political donations are crucial to bennetts 
recommendations 
sources said thursday that the fundraiser keating held for 
riegle is one of the links cited by bennett riegle has said the 
proximity of the event and the sessions with regulators were 
coincidental 
one source said bennett is throwing up for the committee the 
possibility that when a political contribution is so close to an 
event is there a way it cannot be connected 
riegles case could be the most difficult of the five the two 
senators that bennett recommended dropping mccain and glenn broke 
off contacts with banking regulators after an april 9 1987 
meeting attended by all five lawmakers 
the five senators were told during that session that criminal 
referrals would be made to the justice department on the conduct of 
keatings lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif 
cranston and deconcini continued their contacts with regulators 
until april 1989 when lincoln was seized by the government 
leaving the taxpayers to cover losses that could exceed 2 billion 
the two senators said the contacts after april 1987 were in support 
of a sale of lincoln that could have saved jobs 
riegle has said he ended his intervention with regulators as 
did glenn and mccain after the april 9 meeting 
but in riegles case bennetts report gives weight to the 
timing of the fundraiser hosted by keating on march 23 1987 and a 
meeting a few weeks earlier on march 6 between riegle and the 
top sampl regulator at the time edwin j gray 
riegle acknowledged that he suggested to gray that the regulator 
meet with senators concerned about the treatment of keatings sampl 
although riegle said he did not arrange it such a meeting was held 
on april 2 1987 between gray and cranston deconcini mccain and 
glenn 
gray contends the senators offered a deal to aid keatings 
operation at that meeting but all four senators vigorously deny 
the allegation 
in contending there was no connection between the fundraiser and 
the intervention with regulators riegle has said the event was 
scheduled two months earlier 
riegle raised 78250 from keating and associates in the event 
at the pontchartrain hotel in detroit owned by keating in 1988 a 
year after the event riegle announced he returned the money 
because it could create the appearance of a conflict of 
interest 
meanwhile mccain met with the ethics committee privately 
thursday as glenn had done the day before 
emerging after about three hours mccain said he felt good 
about the session and predicted he would be exonerated before the 
senate adjourns later this month 
cranston riegle and deconcini are to appear before the 
committee over the next two weeks

president bush through some fancy rhetorical 
footwork is moving toward a more moderate public stance on the 
persian gulf crisis in an apparent bid to recruit more arabs into 
the antiiraq cause 
until his speech at the united nations this week the 
administration had left open the possibility of a longterm 
american presence in the gulf and of fashioning a usled security 
alliance for the area to ensure future stability 
the administration also resisted any linkage between the gulf 
and the arabisraeli disputes implying that the respective 
conflicts had more differences than similarities 
many arabs although troubled by the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
also are wary about what they perceive as massive us interference 
in the region to the extent that there are arab hearts still up 
for grabs bush is trying to woo them and what better forum to do 
that than the un general assembly 
in his speech without repudiating what he and his subordinates 
had said previously the president quietly shifted the focus on 
several sore points in a way that was more palatable to arab 
opinion 
bush did what presidents often do he didnt change the policy 
only the emphasis 
the administration had left the impression that the us 
military forces might be in saudi arabia for the long haul but 
bush offered a different spin when he said those forces will not 
remain there for one day longer than is necessary once their 
mission is completed every single american soldier will be 
brought home he said 
these comments seemed aimed at arab critics who although 
opposed to the iraqi invasion of kuwait feel offended that 
american infidels are armed to the teeth and wandering around 
islams most sacred turf 
in this category is irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khameini who while no friend of iraq invited states of the region 
last month to fight americas aggression in the cause of 
allah 
bush also appeared to put to rest the notion that the answer to 
longterm gulf stability is an americanled military alliance 
secretary of state james a baker iii raised that possibility a 
month ago in congressional testimony but the president said such a 
task should be left to the gulf states themselves 
bush thus indicated an awareness about arab sensibilities about 
american influence in the region 
in his speech the president stressed his interest in a 
diplomatic solution in the gulf declining to repeat his earlier 
warnings that the presence of 1000 or so american hostages in iraq 
and kuwait will not deter him from taking military action against 
iraq 
he also offered something for arabs who support the restoration 
of kuwaiti sovereignty but who are embittered by israeli occupation 
of the west bank and the gaza strip 
once iraq leaves kuwait unconditionally bush said i truly 
believe there may be opportunities for all the states and 
peoples of the region to settle conflicts that divide the arabs 
from israel 
put another way bush implied that unless saddam hussein 
withdraws from kuwait no one should expect any progress toward an 
arabisraeli settlement 
previously the administration had rejected even a hint of 
linkage between the two conflicts as officials see it restoration 
of kuwaiti authority would not threaten iraq but the establishment 
of a palestinian state in the west bank and gaza would threaten 
israel unless ironclad guarantees are negotiated 
in that sense the two issues are not viewed here as analogous 
but bush made the link anyway without giving anything up after 
all its campaign season and like any good politician bush is 
looking for support

republican senate candidate allen kolstad 
has the white house on his side but sen max baucus has the money 
the lead and widespread appeal among rural montana voters 
kolstad the states lieutenant governor is a wealthy rancher 
and grain farmer who is trying to tar baucus as a liberal in favor 
of big government kolstads conservative pitch even includes a 
reminder that he opposes ted kennedy on most national issues 
but baucus pays close attention to rural and economic concerns 
pet issues include aid to rural hospitals essential air service 
subsidies for rural airline routes and agricultural trade he voted 
against the 1990 farm bill saying it didnt do enough for farmers 
kolstad was at least 20 points behind baucus in an independent 
midseptember poll in addition the republican is up against the 
largest campaign bankroll in montana history 
baucus raised 19 million in the 18 months ending in june a 
princely sum in a state with only 800000 people aggressive 
fundraising efforts continue 
baucus says hes just taking precautions 
kolstad had only 267000 in campaign funds on june 30 but if 
the race gets closer he may look to national gop groups for 
eleventhhour fundraising help 
that approach worked in 1988 when political newcomer conrad 
burns narrowly upset twoterm democratic sen john melcher of 
montana to become the first republican us senator from this state 
in 36 years the huge infusions of cash used to help burns are 
being challenged in a lawsuit and in a complaint before the federal 
election commission 
if someone unfairly attacks me im going to respond says 
baucus i just have be to prepared for the possibility that ill 
face the same deluge of dollars 
in the 1988 race burns a former farmandranch broadcaster 
attacked melcher as a liberal out of touch with conservative rural 
montana 
kolstad has adopted the same strategy 
more federal bureaucracy more federal control the higher 
deficits there are the things im going to be fighting against in 
washington says kolstad 
like burns kolstad was recruited by national gop heavyweights 
including president bush and former president reagan bush raised 
more than 100000 for kolstad when the president traveled to 
montana in july 
kolstad cannot claim the mantle of political outsider he spent 
20 years in the montana legislature before winning the lieutenant 
governorship on the gop ticket with gov stan stephens in 1988 
the stephenskolstad adminstration has not been universally 
popular in montana struggling with tax and budget issues and 
controversial appointees recent polls show his negatives 
nearly doubled since a similar poll in midjune 
kolstad 58 says he is saving his money for a lastminute 
barrage of media advertising attacking baucus on his votes against 
defense spending tax cuts and budgetbalancing measures 
the 48yearold baucus running for a third term has been 
working hard to dispel whatever liberal image he may have had 
he earns relatively high marks from most liberal interest groups 
but insists he doesnt care about ratings 
i dont look left i dont look right i look forward to 
what is the best solution for montana says baucus most people 
are more concerned with producing results for montana than with 
labels 
baucus has barely mentioned kolstad in campaign materials 
preferring instead to emphasize efforts he says have created or 
protected jobs in economically depressed montana 
while differences between the candidates exist baucus is 
prochoice on abortion kolstad is not for example the race has 
generated few fireworks

the small central african nation of 
rwanda faced a population and ecological crisis even before it was 
invaded this week by armed refugees from neighboring uganda 
an exodus of asian businessmen from their adopted country was an 
ominous sign of deteriorating conditions including overpopulation 
soil erosion and aids 
western experts say more than 50 families of mainly indian and 
pakistani origin have left rwanda in recent months in search of 
fresh opportunities in neighboring tanzania uganda and zaire 
countries also suffering from poverty disease and violence 
reflecting the trend the black market price for us dollars 
preferably in 100 bills favored for smuggling shot up to more 
than double the bank exchange rate of 68 rwanda francs per dollar 
aid agencies estimate that fewer than 500 asian families remain 
in a population of about 8 million people crammed into a rugged 
landscape only the size of maryland 
western experts warn that a human and environmental disaster 
might occur in this decade in the former belgian protectorate 
which gained independence in 1962 
the ecological balance is already threatened 
early this year at least 300 people died in sporadic outbreaks 
of famine in the remote south said a western aid worker 
interviewed by the associated press last month in kigali the 
capital 
in the west lake kivu running most of the way along the border 
with zaire had little fish life left because of caustic runoff 
from cultivated volcanic uplands nearby 
rwanda is africas most densely populated country with an 
average of 566 people living on every rocky and eroded square mile 
of land 
the government of president juvenal habyarimana reports the 
average rwandan woman bears 86 children the highest birth rate in 
the world at the present rate the population will double by the 
year 2006 
land pressure is critical there are simply too many people 
living on too little land said the aid specialist who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
annually cultivated land loses at least 15 inches of topsoil 
to erosion crops are grown on 60degree slopes and in other areas 
the level of acid in exhausted soil is a fraction away from the 
reading that would classify the land as barren 
in 1981 the average rwandans daily nourishment amounted to 
2511 calories it dropped to 1804 calories in 1990 and current 
projections indicate the figure will sink to about 1400 calories 
by the year 2000 
the united nations food and agriculture organization says that 
adults need a basic minimum of 2100 calories a day to lead a 
healthy life 
in 10 years experts predict hunger will be widespread and food 
aid will be needed on a scale not seen since the ethiopian famine 
of the mid1980s 
even if all the remaining patches of nature preserve and forest 
were turned over to agriculture additional food production would 
only cover the population growth for two years a kigalibased 
european researcher told the ap 
without the forests acting as waterretaining sponges the 
ultimate ecological collapse would hasten said the researcher 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
in rwandas towns where only 5 percent of the population live 
up to 40 percent of the people are estimated to be infected by the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome a mainly 
heterosexual disease in africa 
a large proportion of these may die within the next decade say 
hospital officials also 1 in every 5 babies born in the towns can 
be expected to die before age 4 having contracted the aids virus 
in an infected mothers womb

john lennons 50th birthday will be marked with 
a celebration beyond even the slain rock stars utopian vision his 
peace anthem imagine playing simultaneously for 1 billion 
people in 130 countries 
this idea appealed to me because not only will we cover the 
whole world but also theres something thats very small said 
lennons widow yoko ono who will speak briefly before the song is 
played oct 9 at 10 am edt 
its not a pandemonium and i thought that was in johns 
spirit in a way we didnt believe in pandemoniums we believed in 
just an honest kind of communication 
lennon was gunned down outside his manhattan apartment house in 
december 1980 
the 10minute event will be broadcast worldwide from the united 
nations and will also feature a short introduction by marcela 
perez de cuellar wife of the un secretary general 
a taped message from lennon will be broadcast before imagine 
is played 
theres no commercials theres no sponsors it is a pure 
simple very touching event said jeff pollack the radio and 
television consultant who came up with the idea 
as of thursday more than 1000 radio stations and networks from 
50 countries had signed on for the satellite broadcast us armed 
forces television and radio will hit another 80plus countries the 
event will also air on mtv in 25 countries said network 
spokeswoman andrea smith 
pollack the head of the californiabased pollack media group 
said the idea came to him after an april meeting with ono where 
they discussed possible tributes for the 50th birthday 
i was riding around in a cab in new york city and then 
imagine came on the radio it just flashed what if we played 
this song around the world said pollack 
he made the proposal to yoko who gave it the goahead ono 
believes the recent events in germany eastern europe and 
particularly the middle east point up the importance of lennons 
peace message 
when this was discussed we had no knowledge of what would 
happen in iraq and kuwait you know and now it seems very 
appropriate that this be sung all over the world said ono 
its going to be sung in the persian gulf 
i dont know the timing is incredible its beyond me 
its beautiful

the bush administration is revising its star 
wars plan to build a defense against limited strikes from enemy 
missiles instead of an allout attack by the soviet union the 
projects director says 
the change reflects the administrations view that improved 
ussoviet relations and the collapse of communism make it less 
likely that moscow would unleash its arsenal of thousands of 
globecircling nuclear ballistic missiles 
it also points up a decline in congressional support for 
spending billions of dollars a year on the strategic defense 
initiative commonly called star wars and the administrations 
desire to deploy some form of missile defense system in the 
mid1990s 
the new system not yet officially announced is being designed 
to defend against tens or hundreds of missiles fired 
accidentally by the soviets or deliberately by a third world 
renegade leader rather than the thousands of missiles that would 
be expected to fill the skies in a fullscale strike by moscow 
henry f cooper the pentagon official in charge of the 
strategic defense initiative said in an interview thursday that 
the revised antimissile system could be deployed more quickly than 
the system originally envisioned 
he said he could not give a target date for deployment or a 
precise estimate of the cost 
i would say its still somewhat uncertain but obviously less 
than the pentagons estimate of 55 billion for the initial phase 
of the current star wars plan 
about 20 billion has been spent on star wars research since 
1984 the administration is requesting 47 billion for star wars 
in the current budget year but congress is expected to shave at 
least 1 billion off that figure the houses version of the 1991 
defense budget set star wars spending at 23 billion 
cooper who last july took over as the first civilian director 
of star wars said he decided to push the less ambitious plan in 
hopes of winning a consensus in congress that at least a limited 
defense against missiles is feasible if that is accomplished he 
said then the administration might eventually gain the needed 
political support and financing to expand the system 
he has nicknamed the new approach the protection against limited 
strike system 
it would not constitute an effective defense against a massive 
raid but would provide protection not deterrence but protection 
against an accidental or unauthorized and even deliberate 
terrorist attack of i dont know tens or hundreds of missiles 
he said 
cooper also raised the possibility that the initially deployed 
system might exclude the spacebased weapons that have been at the 
heart of star wars since former president reagan launched the idea 
in 1983 as a way to end nuclear confrontation 
in my mind it would involve space and groundbased elements 
both cooper said but later he added we may dispute about 
whether spacebased elements are required i dont know 
inclusion of spacebased weapons is controversial because the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty prohibits spacebased defenses 
washington is pressing moscow to agree to modify or drop the abm 
treaty to permit a transition from a nuclear balance based on 
offensive threats to one based on defense 
cooper a quietspoken former chief us negotiator at the 
superpower defense and space talks in geneva said his ideas for 
transforming the star wars program originated in a classified 
review he conducted for defense secretary dick cheney shortly 
before he replaced gen george monahan as the program director 
he said his review found serious problems in the groundbased 
elements of a phase one deployment of star wars weapons 
phase one included ground and spacebased satellites to detect 
missile launches and track their trajectory a constellation of 
spacebased rockets to knock down the missiles in space 
groundbased rockets to destroy missiles reentering earths 
atmosphere a groundbased radar to help guide the interceptor 
rockets and a command center for human management and control of 
the battle 
cooper said the revised plan calls for fewer and differently 
designed groundbased rockets a vastly reformulated groundbased 
radar and fewer brilliant pebbles or spacebased rockets that 
would vaporize enemy missiles by ramming them

david souter says he will live up to his 
monkish bookish workaholic image when he joins the supreme court 
next week but he also hopes to do a few touristy things after 
he moves to washington 
souter whose primary afterwork pleasure seems to be more work 
said this week he expects that he will stick to his office and 
lawbooks at least for his first year in the nations capital 
we all know the work load there is enormous he said tuesday 
in an interview with the associated press i realize what im 
getting into i intended to work a long week anyway but i imagine 
im going to have my limits tested 
he said he understands his fellow justices want him to start as 
soon as he is sworn in tuesday morning 
they very muchwwanted me to start sitting tuesday because 
there is always the possibility of a 44 decision if theyre 
sitting without a full complement souter said 
what little free time souter may have already is being mapped 
out for him by the districts social set an article this week in 
the washington post named the 51yearold jurist the citys most 
eligible bachelor which souter said sounds pretty good to me 
ive really got to wait and see what effects it brings he 
said 
potential dates might prepare themselves for a trip to the 
smithsonian institution or the lincoln memorial 
there are some things that i have never done that most school 
kids have done souter said i have never for example toured 
the capitol 
he did manage a brief peep at the buildings rotunda as he 
called on members of the senate judiciary committee in july 
i said to the man from the white house who was with me ive 
just got to go in and look at this for a minute he said i 
kind of gawked around until i realized that people were moving 
their eyes from the murals to me so i retreated 
someday i may have to do it with a paper bag over my head 
but someday im going to do some of those touristy things that i 
would really like to do 
his one wellknown recreation hiking may have to wait until 
hes able to return to new hampshires white mountains 
i dont expect much he said years ago i did get down 
into the blue ridge mountains once id like to see them again 
but well have to wait and see i just dont think theres going to 
be much time for those excursions 
his last weekend before joining the court will be spent finding 
somewhere to live and reading briefs 
souter said his lack of preparation no apartment no law 
clerks no secretaries wasnt carelessness but simply practical 
he worried the senate might not approve his nomination 
you can chalk it up maybe to as one of my friends says a 
nautical superstition he said maybe i read too many greek 
tragedies i dont believe somethings going to happen like that 
until its happened 
even apart from that i think if i were a member of the senate 
and i realized somebody was out lining up law clerks or apartments 
or anything else i think i would regard it as extraordinarily 
presumptuous 
lining up an apartment however should not be hard souters 
living requirements are simple he told friends that all he wants 
is a bedroom big enough for a bed a living room big enough for a 
chair a kitchen and a bathroom 
he plans to live in the city for his first year but later may 
move like his high court colleagues to the maryland or virginia 
suburbs 
i after all have been spending the last 23 or 24 years of my 
life with a 25minute commute he said i realize its not 
so easy but you dont have to look out for cows down there

there are 13 million hidden poor people in 
america those living in destitution but not counted by the 
official government measure of poverty the head of a house 
committee says 
rep tony hall dohio chairman of the select committee on 
hunger said thursday that census bureau poverty statistics 
released last week rely on a poverty line standard that is outdated 
and understates the problem 
the census bureaus statistics for 1989 show an overall poverty 
rate of 128 percent or 31 million people about what it was the 
year before 
these rates as shameful as they are mask the real depth of 
the problem hall said as he opened a hearing on the need for 
adjustments in the official government poverty measurement 
thirtyone million is millions short of what the american 
people and many scholars think about the number of poor 
americans he said citing studies that put the figure 13 million 
higher thirteen million hidden poor with these additional poor 
were talking about one out of every five americans living in 
poverty 
the official poverty line is based on government measurements 
established in 1963 there have been annual adjustments since then 
to account for inflation but witnesses told the panel those 
adjustments havent been adequate 
that measure represented a reasonable estimate of minimum 
family needs in 1963 but it has never been updated to reflect 
changes in consumption patterns and standards of living since the 
early 1960s said patricia ruggles an economist with the 
congressional joint economic committee 
in fact that measure is based on consumption data from the 
mid1950s she said 
the poverty scale was based on estimates of minimum adequate 
food budgets and then tripled on the assumption that food 
represents about onethird of total expenditures ruggles said 
the scale has not been changed to reflect that the average us 
family now spends 42 percent of its income on housing she said or 
that fewer families have the services of a fulltime homemaker to 
take care of young children it also does not consider differences 
in cost of living between regions or urban and rural areas 
updated scales based on more modern estimates of food and 
housing costs would raise the poverty threshold more than 50 
percent to 14000 to 16000 or more for a family of three in 
1988 the official poverty measure is 9435 she said 
two government benefit programs whose eligibility standards are 
tied directly to the official poverty measure food stamps and 
medicaid use cutoffs substantially higher around 130 percent of 
the poverty line 
these higher eligibility thresholds are perhaps an implicit 
acknowledgement that our current poverty thresholds do not 
represent a realistic minimum standard of consumption ruggles 
said 
a bill passed by the house would provide for a national academy 
of science study of revisions to the poverty line it awaits senate 
action 
hall said many were reluctant to redraw the poverty lines 
because the numbers of poor would be increased but he said a more 
accurate count will lead to a new sense of just how urgent our 
fight against hunger and poverty in america really is 
william p ohare director of policy studies for the population 
referece bureau a liberal advocacy group cited polling for his 
group that showed the public believes actual poverty begins at a 
higher income 
use of the official poverty measure distorts our understanding 
of poverty and understates the dimensions of poverty and hunger in 
america ohare said nearly 13 million people who have incomes 
just above the official poverty line are not counted as poor by the 
government but are considered to be poor by their neighbors

rep dana rohrabacher says hell fight a new 
compromise bill on the national endowment for the arts as a piece 
of flimflummery that will do nothing to halt federal support 
for obscene and sacrilegious art 
the california republican a staunch conservative and ardent foe 
of the federal arts agency said he will seek to defeat the 
bipartisan measure drafted by reps pat williams dmont and e 
thomas coleman rmo the house begins debate on the proposal next 
week 
its a sham and a facade to deceive the voters rohrabacher 
said its a total fraud it portends to offer some kind of 
restrictions on federal funding for obscenity when in reality it 
opens the floodgates 
williams and coleman who announced agreement on their 
compromise thursday after weeks of intensive negotiations proposed 
to extend the neas life for three years and let the courts decide 
whether federally subsidized arts projects are obscene 
rohrabacher said their bill was the type of flimflummery that 
makes americans cynical about the politicians in washington 
he said it reflects the democratic leaderships loyalty to a 
fringe of freak artists who insist they have the right to federal 
tax dollars to produce pornography and sacrilegious art 
rohrabacher says he will introduce a floor amendment that would 
prohibit nea support for a laundry list of taboos including 
obscenity indecency child pornography and works that attack 
religion desecrate the american flag or contain any part of a 
human fetus 
coleman and rep paul henry rmich hinted that the real aim 
of rohrabacher and his conservative allies was to dismantle the nea 
or abolish it entirely 
the question is whether to dismantle this agency or make it 
better henry said this bill would make it better 
williams predicted that their measure will pass the house by a 
significant majority of both democrats and republicans 
the bill could provide house members a way to defuse the 
politically explosive issue of federal support for obscene art 
in an election year 
the controversy began 18 months ago when conservative lawmakers 
and religious fundamentalists attacked the nea for subsidizing 
exhibitions of works by photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist 
andres serrano which they denounced as obscene and blasphemous 
the williamscoleman compromise would forbid the endowment from 
financing obscenity but it would shift from the nea to the courts 
the burden of deciding what is obscene based on the supreme 
courts 1973 guidelines 
under the bill any grant recipient who is convicted of 
violating obscenity laws would be required to repay the government 
and would be barred from receiving further nea grants for at least 
three years 
in a bow to republican demands the bill also would boost the 
states share of nea grant money from 20 percent to 35 percent over 
the next three years coleman originally had sought to shift 60 
percent of nea funds to the control of state arts agencies 
the measure also would make sweeping changes in the endowments 
grantmaking procedures with the aim of making the nea more 
accountable to the taxpaying public it would bolster the nea 
chairmans authority to make final grant decisions and dilute the 
panels of outside artists and arts managers which select grant 
applications for approval 
similar legislation is awaiting senate floor action also headed 
for the house floor is a separate bill to provide 180 million in 
nea spending next year a 5 percent increase over its current 171 
million budget 
meanwhile nea chairman john e frohnmayer and evangelist pat 
robertson clashed again thursday over robertsons claim that 
federal funds supported an atlanta puppet show featuring simulated 
oral sex 
in a sept 28 letter to robertson released thursday frohnmayer 
vigorously denied that any nea funds were spent on the puppet show 
or its sponsor the arts festival of atlanta 
robertson ignored frohnmayers demand for a public retraction of 
his categorically false allegation the evangelist told his 
television audience that if members of congress vote to give the 
nea more money next year it shows they are totally out of touch 
with america and with morality

a movie theater bowed to pressure from town 
officials and canceled the showing of henry and june the first 
film rated nc17 the designation that replaced the x rating 
showcase cinema was to have started screening henry and june 
today the film based on the diaries of anais nin chronicles her 
affairs with writer henry miller and his wife 
they can call it whatever they want to call it anthony 
taurasi chairman of the towns board of selectmen said thursday 
if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its a duck 
lets call it what it is 
the motion picture association of america replaced the x rating 
with the nc17 rating on sept 26 nc17 means no one under age 17 
can be admitted to the films 
selectman frank geishecker told the patriot lddger of quincy on 
wednesday he would consider revoking the theaters license if the 
film was shown 
we are not censors he said the censoring is done by the 
rating bureau all we care is that we preserve the community 
standards of the town of dedham that is our mission that is our 
job 
both selectmen admit they have not seen the film released by 
universal pictures directed by philip kaufman and starring fred 
ward and uma thurman henry and june received the nc17 rating 
because of two lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic drawing 
ira korf chief executive of showcase cinemas parent company 
national amusements inc said he pulled the film from the dedham 
theater because of complaints from the two selectmen 
i pointed out very strongly this film wasnt rated x said 
fred mound president of distribution for universal pictures 
there was extreme pressure coming down obviously im very 
disturbed by it 
the mpaa switch was made exactly to avoid these situations 
mound said the association changed the designation because the x 
rating carried the stigma of pornography 
korf said national amusements had decided to show nc17rated 
films because the new rating means they cannot be confused with 
hardcore pornography films 
taurasi said that showcase cinema had a gentlemans agreement 
with the town not to show xrated films that the nc17 rating was 
just a way around the ratings bureau 
dedham is a middleclass suburb with more than 25000 residents 
about 10 miles south of boston 
henry amp june was to have opened on 77 screens in 31 cities 
in the united states and canada today instead of henry and 
june the dedham theater will show the actionadventure movie

palestinian groups are increasingly 
threatening retaliation for any harm that comes to iraq especially 
at the hands of the united states 
a group called the palestinian popular armyblack panther forces 
faxed a statement to the associated press bureau in nicosia late 
thursday headlined warning in bold letters 
the tempo of imperialist threats against iraq is increasing 
day after day with the aim of bringing iraq to its knees through 
hunger said the arabic language statement 
orders have been issued to our forces wherever they exist for 
immediate retaliation on land sea and air against the aggressor 
should iraq be subjected to any aggression it said 
not as much is known about the group which has been active by 
issuing similar statements since the kuwait invasion the group is 
believed to be supportive of fatah the main branch of the 
palestine liberation organization 
it was the third such threat in two days by radical 
palestinians 
the threats have heightened fears of a terrorist campaign 
against the western and arab nations confronting iraq since the 
persian gulf crisis began 
iraq has been isolated by the international community since aug 
2 when it seized kuwait since then a usled multinational force 
has been sent to the region and the un security council has 
imposed a land sea and air embargo on iraq to try to force it to 
withdraw from kuwait 
the us state department saturday warned americans traveling 
abroad that they run the risk of iraqisponsored attacks in the 
near future 
the arab liberation front based in baghdad said in a statement 
thursday it will respond decisively and immediately with powerful 
strikes if iraqi civilian aircraft are endangered by the united 
states 
all american interests in the arab world and in the world at 
large will not be far from the hands of the revolutionaries who 
will prove that the whole universe could be a battlefield so that 
the americans will know what kind of foe they face the statement 
said 
it was published in baghdads althawra daily the newspaper of 
the iraqs ruling baath socialist party 
the arab liberation front which has a few hundred men has not 
been very active since it and other plo factions were forced to 
evacuate beirut in 1982 during the israeli invasion of lebanon it 
is led by abdulrahim ahmed a member of the plos executive 
committee 
thursdays warnings came a day after the palestinian guerrilla 
leader who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the italian cruise 
liner achille lauro said he would attack us aircraft if iraqi 
planes were struck in the air embargo 
abul abbas head of the radical palestine liberation front 
called the air embargo the operation of air piracy by one state 
against another to serve its narrowminded interests 
abul abbas statement was published wednesday in aljumhuriya 
another governmentrun daily in baghdad 
abbas did not specify what action would be taken but extremist 
palestinian leaders based in iraq have specialized in attacks on 
airliners and airports in the past

soldiers call this 
recreation outpost panther paradise but it hardly lives up to its 
name 
some soldiers pass the time racing beetles or watching scorpions 
fight 
others try to run pass patterns on a more or less flat patch of 
sand that serves as a football field 
still others congregate at the px a metal shipping container 
or the cinema a tent with some cots and a television set showing 
marlon brando mumbling his way through the godfather 
four hundred yards away the m1 tanks of the 2nd battalion 
69th armor regiment known as the panthers lie in wait under 
camouflage netting ready to roar into action if the order comes 
paradise is ok but i wish it was a little farther to the 
rear said spec kristopher mccoy 20 from ft wayne ind 
the battalion clerk was among the two dozen troops who on 
thursday were enjoying a twoday break from the rigors of training 
but they were also waiting possibly for war with iraq 
the us military command is formulating a policy to allow 
troops rest and recreation outside saudi arabia last weekend the 
command opened its first fullfledged randr center in the country 
at a location off limits to everyone else 
in addition individual units have been ordered to set up rest 
centers close to their frontline positions this spot known by 
the soldiers as panther paradise is one of the first 
if it got any better than this i wouldnt know what to do 
said command sgt major tim gabel of forth worth texas watching 
brando from the doorway of the darkened movie tent where cool is 
only a relative term 
sgt 1st class richard hawk of atlanta who runs the operation 
said the portable showers and woodenfloored tents including the 
cinema are about as luxurious as it can get in the desert 
a trio of soldiers tossed a football around but they quit after 
a few minutes of trying to run pass patterns in the loose sand 
hawk said that in addition to watching beetles and scorpions 
the soldiers occupy themselves playing volleyball chess checkers 
darts and card games 
id like to have basketball too but this stuff aint too 
swift hawk said kicking the sand 
he said he paid 1500 for chips and dips so the troops can 
munch away while watching videotapes soldiers can also do their 
laundry and get haircuts 
some other units have pxs and some might have a vcr but even 
people from brigade headquarters come down here he said we 
dont turn anybody away 
staff sgt raymond horne 24 of brooklyn ny stands behind 
the px counter selling cigarettes snacks magazines and other 
items the cold drinks are free so is the advise he dispenses 
basically the soldiers want to know when were going home 
he said i tell em six months hopefully

neighborhood beautifiers who say 
driveway basketball hoops are eyesores want to slam dunk them all 
opponents eager to bench the plan say its unamerican 
whats the point of having the pristine appearance in garden 
city if its not for our children to enjoy donna robins the 
mother of three ballplaying boys said at a village trustees 
meeting thursday night 
others in town including new york knicks hall of famer dave 
debusschere and exnew york nets guard bill melchionne are 
mounting a fast break to overturn the towns policy 
the flap actually began two years ago when the affluent long 
island town included basketball hoops under a 1924 law banning 
accessory structures 
freestanding basketball hoops on the side and front of homes 
were deemed unacceptable hoops attached to homes or garages or 
freestanding hoops located in back yards were allowed to remain 
about 60 people most of whom opposed the ban crowded into the 
small village hall thursday night 
joseph asselta an attorney with two boys and a hoop out front 
said he would take the town to court if officials order him to take 
the basket down he called the action unconstitutional because town 
officials had not uniformly enforced the 66yearold law 
the trustees were unmoved they said letters will be sent 
immediately to 72 homeowners with offending hoops giving them 90 
days to comply 
people who decide to flaunt the law and keep their rims intact 
face up to a 250aday fine although they should be able to 
appeal to the local zoning board 
i think its absurd and it seems ridiculous said 
melchionne who played on the aba champion nets in 1974 with julius 
erving if they dont have the availability of hoops who knows 
what kids will do 
debusschere echoed those comments to the associated press after 
returning from a trip to the soviet union 
i dont buy the idea that its an eyesore i think it enhances 
a neighborhood it humanizes it said debusschere who has a hoop 
hanging legally in his back yard 
the sound of a dribbling basketball and the swish of a 
successful jump shot are the sounds of youtfful energy it is 
as american as apple pie said village trustee jack curry who 
offered an alternate plan that was voted down 
mayor john mcgowan a member of the antihoops troops shot 
back garden city has nothing against anything allamerican the 
village wants to keep garden city beautiful keep its aesthetic 
beauty 
currys compromise would have saved all but three of the 
existing hoops and ensured all future buckets were 30 feet from 
the nearest street that plan was recently rejected by a 52 vote

an agriculture department survey shows the 
loss of wetlands on private lands nationwide slowed significantly 
during the mid1980s 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said thursday that the new 
figures by the departments soil conservation service or scs 
indicated wetland losses ranged between 100000 and 200000 acres 
per year from 1982 to 1987 including areas that reverted to open 
water 
this was significantly less than wetland loss estimates 
before 198287 he said 
no previous scs estimates were available spokeswoman diana 
morse said the agency began its fiveyear surveys in 1977 the new 
figures comparing 1987 with 1982 were the first she said 
estimates used in the surveys were based on information 
collected on 300000 sample sites across the nation 
the latest figures came from the agencys 1987 national 
resources inventory or nri which is conducted on nonfederal 
lands every five years in cooperation with the iowa state 
university statistical laboratory 
officials said the inventory serves as the principal source of 
information on the status condition and trends of soil water and 
related resources it also provides a soilandwater data base for 
nonfederal rural lands 
the report said there were about 82 million ares of wetlands on 
nonfederal rural lands in 1987 down from 832 million acres in 
1982 
however scs estimated the loss of wetlands to agricultural and 
development uses at closer to 500000 acres or an average of 
100000 acres per year 
the remaining change in wetlands was due to factors such as 
300000 acres changing from private to federal ownership still 
likely remaining in wetlands but not included in the scs 
nonfederal lands inventory and over 400000 acres that changed 
to open water primarily adjacent to the great salt lake in utah 
and in southern louisiana the report said 
of the nearly 500000 acres lost to agriculture and development 
about 215000 were converted farmland including wetlands drying up 
because of drought and about 280000 acres to development 
regionally the nri indicated wetland losses over the fiveyear 
period were greatest in the southeast mississippi delta states 
and the great lakes states 
losses were reported at 170000 acres in the southeast 150000 
in the delta and 80000 in the great lakes 
morse said there were no available breakdowns by state and that 
the scs considered those estimates too inexact for publishing she 
said the regional estimates were the only ones available 
 
washington ap farm cooperatives hurting badly a few years 
ago from the financial crunch on producers have recovered most of 
their old zing an annual report by the agriculture department 
shows 
in 1989 the report said coops reported their secondhighest 
net income and thirdhighest sales 
overall combined business volume was shown at 704 billion up 
6 percent from 664 billion in 1988 that was topped only by the 
record 73 billion in 1984 and the 715 billion in 1981 
net incomes in 1989 totaled nearly 19 billion the report 
said that was up 123 percent from 1988 the record was 194 
billion in 1980 
randall e torgerson administrator of the departments 
agricultural cooperative service said the higher business volume 
was due mostly to larger output of grains and oilseeds higher 
price for poultry and higher prices and sales of fruits and 
vegetables fertilizers and farm chemicals 
production of feed grains and soybeans was up sharply last year 
from 1988 when drought reduced yields 
increased earnings of farm supply coops were a major 
contributing factor to the nearrecord income despite a increase 
in the number of cooperatives reporting losses in 1989 the report 
said those increased to 574 from 364 in 1988 however the amount 
of losses decreased to 824 million last year from 1647 million 
the previous year 
total cooperative business volume includes the value of products 
marketed the sale of farm supplies such as fertilizer chemicals 
fuel and feed to members and other customers and receipts from 
services including trucking storage ginning and artificial 
insemination 
torgerson said the number of farm cooperatives and members 
continued a longtime downward trend 
coop units declined to 4799 last year from 4937 in 1988 he 
said memberships dropped 14 percent to 414 million the number 
of memberships exceeds the number of farms because many farmers 
belong to more than one coop 
 
washington ap an agriculture department scientist says that 
after 10 years he is close to developing a soybean that has both 
high protein and high yields 
plant geneticist joseph w burton of the departments 
agricultural research service said in a report that preliminary 
results show a boost in protein content to almost 47 percent from 
about 42 percent 
the preliminary results also show excellent yields for the new 
bean he said overall it could mean a possible boost in revenue 
to soybean producers of 1 to 150 per bushel 
burton who works at the agencys soybean and nitrogen fixation 
research unit in raleigh nc said it will take another year of 
testing to determine how best to make commercial use of the new 
bean

the new chairman of arianespace the european 
satellite launching company says it is time the spacefaring 
nations of the world have an equal footing in both their pricing 
policies and access to markets 
arianespace will not be able to continue its 10 years of 
successful growth if our competitors do not respect the same 
rules the same manner of behavior said charles bigot who took 
over as chairman and chief executive officer two months ago 
we are facing two kinds of competition he said at a news 
conference thursday we are facing competition against american 
launchers which are in the same kind of economy as ariane but 
we are facing also competition from soviet launchers chinese 
launchers which are coming from nonmarket countries 
in the competition with the united states bigot said 
arianespace hopes to get agreement to open the launch market to 
everyone the european firm he said has access to only onethird 
of the market since the united states will not allow military and 
government satellites to be launched overseas 
we consider our american competitors have access to all the 
market and we hope that in fact europe and the united states would 
get some agreement in order to open all the market to all the 
launch vehicle companies he said 
bigot said too he would like to see a change in the pricing 
policies of american launch firms 
there is a small but important difference between the 
launcher in the united states and the launcher ariane about fixed 
cost he said fixed cost is what you have to pay to maintain 
facilities and the tools for producing the launcher 
in the united states bigot said the governmental market pays 
for the fixed cost while commercial customers bear only the 
additional expenses for a given launch 
the way has to be different said bigot you have to 
divide all the fixed cost by the number of launches and you have to 
attribute to each launch the pro rata part of the expenses 
through american accounting the cost is lower and we insist 
to have the same kind of rules on both sides of the atlantic he 
said 
bigot said precautions must be taken with the competition from 
the soviet union and china which do not operate in a free market 
economy 
it is obvious they are not at all evaluating their cost in the 
same manner he said in fact they dont know exactly their 
cost because they are not the same accounting system 
arianespace proposes that europe and the united states work 
toward an agreement with those countries which would allow for an 
intermediate phase while they develop their economies during that 
phase they would be expected to selflimit their marketing 
activities bigot said 
after this period we could accept free access to the market 
when they demonstrate that they have adopted the same rules for the 
economy he said 
in the first half of the 1980s satellite owners depended on the 
space shuttle to launch their cargoes but after the challenger 
accident in 1986 thenpresident reagan ordered the national 
aeronautics and space administration out of the commercial launch 
business and encouraged private industry to step in 
orphaned by the new policy and by a shortage of launch vehicles 
many satellite companies turned to arianespace giving that firm a 
major boost 
we created and developed the commercial space transport 
business bigot said at first we were a challenger now we 
consider in the commercial market we are the leader in the past 
three years alone 30 satellites have been launched on ariane 
rockets 
the three major players on the american launch market are 
mcdonnell douglas which makes the delta rocket martin marietta 
with its titan series and genral dynamics with the atlas all 
three rocket families are also used to lift military and government 
satellites into orbit

a man introduced to the senate as a veteran 
diplomat but described in published reports as a longtime cia 
agent is being dropped as ambassadordesignate to burma 
sen alfonse damato rny said thursday the state department 
told him frederick vreelands nomination would be withdrawn 
a department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed the decision to withdraw vreelands nomination saying 
the burmese refused to accept him after he made statements urging 
democratic changes in the southeast asian country 
the prodemocracy statements were described as nothing more than 
oftstated us policy burmas military junta has refused to 
yield power to a civilian government elected in may 
but damato said he did not believe that was the real reason for 
dropping vreeland 
the senator said he had planned to question vreeland about 
evidence that he led efforts to cover up bulgarian and soviet 
involvement in the 1981 attempted assassination of pope john paul 
ii 
however the state department official who spoke of condition of 
anonymity said the attempt to kill the pope had nothing to do with 
the matter 
damato said that by law he could not comment on whether 
vreeland was a cia agent 
several published reports have identified vreeland as an agent 
working under a diplomatic cover he was listed in his official 
biography as an embassy officer in rome in the years following the 
papal shooting incident 
the biography supplied to the senate foreign relations committee 
by the administration described vreeland as a career diplomat with 
several state department assignments vreeland 63 is son of the 
late vogue magazine editor diana vreeland 
journalist claire sterling in a 1984 book about the 
assassination attempt said vreeland warned her not to pursue the 
bulgarian angle and told her she was on a bulgarian hit list 
damato said he recently spoke with sterling about her 
allegations and also had some firsthand knowledge of italian 
officials anger over vreelands activities in rome ali agca a 
turk who wounded the pope in st peters square is serving a life 
term in italy 
agca at first said he acted alone but later claimed soviet 
involvement an italian court ruled there was not enough evidence 
to convict three bulgarians charged in the case 
damato said he has met with the new president of bulgaria 
zhelyu zhelev who has said he will pursue an inquiry into any 
bulgarian connection to the attempt on the pope damato said he 
also wants an inquiry into any us efforts to cover up 
the motive for the coverup said damato may have been to 
prevent an escalation of ussoviet differences or to prevent 
facts from coming out that might be embarrassing to us officials 
a closeddoor hearing on the nomination was held in the senate 
on monday but sen jesse helms rnc held up committee approval 
of vreeland after getting a letter from damato 
while the state department official confirmed withdrawal of the 
nomination department spokesman david denny said he had no 
official release on it 
denny said assistant secretary richard solomon and burmese 
deputy foreign minister ohn gyaw met on wednesday he said solomon 
urged the seating of the elected civilian government protested 
harassment of us embassy employees in rangoon and called for a 
crackdown against opium production in burma 
but denny declined to give details of gyaws response and said 
he did not know whether there was any discussion of vreelands 
nomination

iraq has highexplosive devices that pack the 
equivalent destructive power of small nuclear bombs a newspaper 
reported today 
the fuelair explosives or faes have 10 times the power of 
conventional explosives and create a huge fireball and shock wave 
over a concentrated area without the radiation fallout associated 
with nuclear weapons the los angeles times reported 
its not your gardenvariety weapon said henry sokolski of 
the pentagons international security affairs office these are 
blasteffect weapons and what you cant see can kill you 
military officials say the united states has no ready defense 
against the explosives that could devastate oil fields air bases 
and troops the newspaper reported 
faes can be launched as bombs from airplanes or as warheads on 
missiles 
pentagon officials said us forces would have the most 
difficulty defending against a missiledelivered warhead but there 
is no clear evidence iraq has the ability to mount the explosives 
on missiles 
senators john glenn dohio and jesse helms rnorth carolina 
are among five senators who have requested in a letter to defense 
secretary dick cheney that he launch an investigation to determine 
iraqs supply of faes 
the times said earlier reports indicated iraq received the 
scientific knowledge to build these weapons from the german arms 
industry 
a major german aerospace and defense firm 
messerschmittbolkowblohm conducted feasibility studies on an fae 
device as part of a missile project with the egyptian government 
that project was terminated in 1988 said company spokesman willie 
vogler 
according to reports from the bbc and der spiegel a german 
magazine egypt gave the studies to iraq 
an unidentified congressional investigator told the times that 
us technology may have been involved as well although the united 
states does not carry faes in its own arsenal 
the weapons are currently in the arsenals of the soviet union 
israel china france west german spain and perhaps some third 
world nations in addition to iraq according to pentagon sources

the chairman of the national endowment for the 
arts says evangelist pat robertson should apologize for providing 
misinformation about whether federal money was used to produce 
an adultoriented puppet show 
nea chairman john frohnmayer said robertson misrepresented the 
truth about the source of funding for the show in atlanta last 
month the evangelist blasted the show on his 700 club tv 
program saying it was produced with nea grant money 
this show was privately funded frohnmayer said at a news 
conference thursday the head of the federal arts agency was in 
atlanta to address local arts leaders and reply to robertsons 
charges 
i would call on rev robertson to apologize to congress to 
whom he has sent misinformation to apologize to the people of 
atlanta whom he has cast in an unfavorable light to apologize to 
those who look to him for truth rather than halftruths 
frohnmayer said 
were not going to apologize for speaking the truth and 
bringing the facts to light robertson spokesman ralph reed said 
later thursday 
robertson said in his thursday morning broadcast that if members 
of congress vote to give the nea more money next year it shows 
they are totally out of touch with america and with morality 
his remarks were the latest attack on atlanta puppeteer jon 
ludwigs play zeitgeist which premiered sept 21 at the 
atlanta arts festival 
robertson previously charged that the puppet show included 
simulated foreplay followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts before 
an audience of 800 people including children 
ludwig described the scene as a satirical treatment of sexual 
temptation as part of an adult morality play he denied it 
contained depictions of oral sex 
robertson who was a republican candidate for president in 1988 
said thursday he had not seen the puppet show but based his 
criticism on newspaper accounts 
the christian coalition a nonprofit organization headed by 
robertson has reported that the nea gave 132500 last year to the 
center for puppetry arts where ludwig is associate artistic 
director 
reed who is executive director of the virginia beach va 
coalition said ludwig would never have been offered the 
opportunity to put on that puppetry show if he hadnt been artistic 
director of one of the largest puppetry arts centers in the 
southeastern united states 
while the nea acknowledged the funding frohnmayer said ludwigs 
performance at the arts festival was under a separate arrangement 
independent of his association with the center for puppetry 
arts 
the controversy began with the complaint of the rev john 
norton a methodist minister from marietta who later withdrew his 
objections while norton said he did not object to the shows 
content he said unsupervised children should not be allowed to 
view adult material 
festival organizers have said they will take steps in the future 
to make sure children will not have access to such material 
in an indirect reference to robertson norton said we do not 
feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the position of being 
connected with the greater issues others have attempted to draw us 
into

the tentative accord to cut nonnuclear 
weapons in europe will lock in reductions now under way and lay out 
the basis for new relations between east and west military experts 
say 
the conventional forces in europe treaty would be the largest 
armscontrol deal in history and the first in europe since the end 
of world war ii the agreement announced wednesday in new york is 
expected to be signed by 22 countries next month in paris 
president bush on thursday hailed the tentative accord which 
would take a far bigger bite out from the soviet arsenal than the 
american one bush said it would decisively improve the balance 
of military power on the continent 
military analysts said the agreement makes it harder for the two 
sides to change their minds on pullouts that have already been 
started 
it makes official and irrevocable these changes said 
richard fieldhouse senior research associate at the natural 
resources defense council in washington unilateral moves are a 
little too easy to reverse 
in a sense we are now writing the armistice for the cold 
war james woolsey the chief us negotiator to the talks said 
recently 
the talks have been designed to bring both sides to equal 
ceilings in main battle tanks armored combat vehicles artillery 
combat aircraft and attack helicopters 
the talks covering an area spanning the atlantic ocean to the 
ural mountains in the soviet union are between the north atlantic 
treaty organization of the west and the sovietled warsaw pact 
even before the signing ceremony the soviets have begun pulling 
equipment out of east european countries once their staunch allies 
but now governed by emerging democracies eager to pull away from 
the kremlin 
a nato official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
soviets already have withdrawn about 20000 tanks from the region 
the soviets also have begun removing their troops from hungary 
and czechoslovakia 
still experts say putting the reductions in writing is 
important 
if this were all done without a treaty you would just be 
taking the other guys word for it that their equipment had been 
taken out of service said the nato official 
the arms talks which seemed so farreaching at their start 
have lagged behind the political and economic upheavals in eastern 
europe the negotiations initially were considered a way of forcing 
change in the east 
the important thing about the treaty is not so much what it 
limits but the fact that its part of a process that you can build 
a new political relationship on said jane sharp senior 
researcher at the stockholm international peace research institute 
in sweden 
the treaty will set out an extensive system of inspections on 
military bases and other areas to make sure no country cheats 
the two sides have agreed to limit main battle tanks to 20000 
for each side artillery pieces to 20000 apiece armored combat 
vehicles to 30000 each and combat helicopters to 2000 apiece 
no cap has been negotiated on combat aircraft however after 
long negotiations bargainers agreed to a limit of 5150 warplanes 
in any single country secretary of state james a baker iii said 
at a joint appearance with bush in washington on thursday 
the agreement technically does not limit the number of us and 
soviet troops in europe the superpowers agreed to skip that step 
to meet the paris deadline 
however gorbachev and bush to a far lesser extent are 
committed to withdrawing soldiers from europe anyway

traders said advances overnight in europe and new york coupled

reserve board chairman alan greenspan on wednesday also fueled 
expectations of lower interest rates 
greenspan speaking before a congressional committee hinted at 
an easier credit policy from the central bank if congress enacts a 
compromise on cutting the federal deficit 
the japanese investors mind is very very good compared to 
just one or two weeks ago said hidetada yoshida of kidder 
peabody international corp 
the prospect of lower interest rates in the united states gave 
investors hope that the bank of japan might also lower rates 
boosting industrial activity he said 
investors have digested the conflict in iraq with the united 
states by about 8090 percent i expect the nikkei will be up 
around 26000 sometime in december he said 
low stock book values also spurred buying and while foreign 
institutional investors were taking the bait he said japanese 
institutional investors are very very chicken because they 
received huge damages from this crash he said

london overnight said toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst 
with new japan securities co 
he said pessimism over prospects for the approval of the 1991 
us budget proposal and over the scheduled announcement of the 
us jobless rate later friday also prompted the dollarselling 
incentives among japanese investors 
with little fresh marketaffecting news here however the 
dollar will not fall too much in tokyo kanai said many market 
players are awaiting release of the us jobless rate 
the dollar dropped against all major foreign currencies 
overnight in new york due to selling on a widespread assumption 
that us interest rates will fall in the near future the dollar 
in new york closed at 13383 yen from 13604 yen 
dealers said the latest dollar selling was triggered by 
greenspans comments a looser monetary policy would lead to lower 
us interest rates which would tend to curb dollar demand by 
making returns on dollardenominated investments less rewarding 
than foreign alternatives 
traders said the index quickly rose as the yens surge against 
the dollar in addition to overnight gains in the dow jones 
industrial average in new york reassured participants

labor leaders reacted angrily to word that mayor 
david dinkins is considering laying off at least 15000 city 
workers to help close a budget deficit that could go as high as 
26 billion by next year 
the mayor has declared war on the unions in the city said 
barry feinstein president of the 23000member teamsters local 
237 he has spit in the eye of public employees through this 
unilateral action 
stanley hill head of the 140000strong district council 37 
union said dinkins plans would lead to total demoralization 
anger frustration for his membersthe same way i feel he 
said 
dinkins said his budget advisers predicted that the layoffs and 
other agency reductions would save 800 million 
the last largescale layoffs in new york came in 1975 when the 
city nearly went bankrupt and about 25000 workers were laid off 
the city has about 240000 workers 
while insisting that layoffs were not yet a certainty dinkins 
took steps thursday to halt all new hiring promotions and merit 
raises 
the mayor said the freeze would save 115 million in payroll 
costs in the current 1991 fiscal year and the 1992 fiscal year 
which starts july 1 
its not at all pleasant needless to say but fiscal 
stability is essential dinkins told reporters at city hall 
philip michael the mayors budget director estimated that 
revenues in this fiscal year would result in a shortfall of 150 
million and next years deficit would reach 14 billion 
comptroller elizabeth holtzman said the budget gap for next year 
could go as high as 26 billion she also projected a budget 
deficit in the current fiscal year as high as 738 million 
the mayor cautioned at the news conference that we havent 
done any layoffs yet nor have we called for any layoffs yet 
but michael said i think layoffs will have to be an essential 
part of that solution 
the mayors freeze announcement came two days after he proposed 
a 18 billion plan to bolster crimefighting citywide including 
hiring nearly 8000 new police officers 
he proposed property taxes hikes and a payroll tax to fund the 
planned law enforcment expansion

a woman who claims the 110yearold house 
she once rented is haunted wants her former landlords to pay the 
fee charged by two ghost hunters she hired to investigate 
joann rich scheduled to appear in vernon superior court today 
is suing kevin odonnell and hayden houston for 2000 she wants 
them to cover the 185 fee she paid to the ghost hunters as well 
as to return a 1250 security deposit and 500 in rent and 
interest 
ed and lorraine warren of monroe who investigated the haunting 
at the long island ny house made famous in the book and movie 
the amityville horror support richs claim that the sevenroom 
victorian house is spooked 
mrs warren who claims she is clairvoyant said she felt the 
presence of a confused somewhat frustrated human spirit in the 
house she said she also felt the presence of something evil 
rich moved into the house in the fall of 1988 with her boyfriend 
and son she moved out 18 months later before her lease was up 
odonnell and houston are countersuing her for 2000 for breaking

george bush went on national television 
enlisted the help of three former presidents and a gravelyill 
republican national chairman and got slaughtered 
the dont worrybe happy theme of his presidential campaign 
just didnt prepare his republicans for swallowing painful budget 
medicine he broke his nonewtaxes pledge but that didnt mean 
they were ready to follow 
the politics of the 1980s was lets pretend said rep 
steny hoyer dmd that psychology is deeply embedded in the 
politics of america 
with the most intensive congressional lobbying effort of his 
presidency bush only mustered 71 of 176 republicans to vote for 
his 500 billion deficit reduction deal with congress democrats 
feared giving republicans an issue and rebuffed their own leaders 
too and the budget failed 254179 
lawmakers just didnt buy the argument that they had to swallow 
tax increases cuts in medicare and other unpopular measures in 
order to reduce the deficit not five weeks before election day 
rep newt gingrich of georgia the house minority whip who led 
republican opposition won big and he didnt even get up and speak 
during the debate 
that a deficit plan had to contain entirely bitter medicine was 
a false notion said rep vin weber rminn who helped 
gingrich it is possible to put together a good plan for the 
economy that will pass 
why was it the compromise put forward and pushed ahead with 
such vigor he asked following the lopsided rejection 
the vote clearly was an embarrassment for house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash and house minority leader robert michel rill 
neither of whom could summon many loyalty votes from their troops 
despite stirring appeals that earned them standing ovations in the 
house 
but it was surely a much more astonishing loss for the 
president who enjoys almost incredible popularity in the polls 
whose oneonone cajoling ability is credited with arranging the 
international blockade of iraq and who appealed to the nation on 
television to pressure congress to pass the plan 
its difficult to imagine what more he could have done 
he had groups of gop lawmakers come to the white house so he 
could lobby them face to face he kept telephone lines all over 
town busy with house members hearing from him even before 7 am 
how painful to him to have to ask each of us personally 
said rep bill frenzel rminn one of the budget negotiators who 
reminded his colleagues during the debate that bush and his veto 
were the house republicans only defense against the majority 
democrats 
the president enlisted the help of the three living former 
republican presidents reagan ford and yes nixon to telephone 
gop members and urge them to support the plan 
i guess jimmy carter didnt call anybody speculated rep 
john myers rind one of the normally loyal republicans whom bush 
couldnt win over on this one 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater who is 
battling a brain tumor sent republican members a letter warning 
that without passage of the budget our hardwon gains could be 
wiped out 
please do not turn your back on the president atwater 
asked 
there was evidence that part of bushs problem was heavyhanded 
lobbying by some of his staff 
rep gerald solomon rny said bush called him at 645 am 
at home then his chief of staff john sununu phoned later and he 
was a little rough 
sununu also got bad reviews at a house republican caucus earlier 
in the week not to mention his comment on television that a gop 
senator opposing the plan was insignificant sen trent lott 
rmiss didnt like being called insignificant 
rep ralph regula rohio said the white house took back its 
offer of the presidents box for a show at the kennedy center after 
he refused to come around 
there have been better moments he said

a quadriplegic man who didnt want to outlive 
his terminally ill father died before the nevada supreme court got 
a chance to rule on his request that he be allowed to end his life 
the las vegas sun reported thursday that kenneth bergstedts 
father robert bergstedt said his son asked him to help end his 
life wednesday night and that he complied by giving him sedatives 
and loosening his respirator tube 
police said the father told them he awoke thursday morning in 
the mobil home the two men shared and found his 31yearold adopted 
son dead 
he said the respirator was loosened during the night said 
police lt steve ducharme 
kenneth bergstedt in court papers filed earlier this year said 
he feared his father would die before he did leaving him with no 
one to care for him he had been paralyzed frmm the neck down since 
a 1969 swimming pool accident 
district judge donald mosley granted bergstedts request to die 
ruling in june that the death would not be considered a suicide and 
that anyone who aided him would not face any penalties 
but mosley asked bergstedt not to end his life until the state 
supreme court could rule on the matter and establish a legal 
precedent 
the high court said it could not issue an immediate ruling 
because the case required more research 
bergstedts attorney jack cherry said if someone did help him 
die they could not be prosecuted 
i have a court order saying anyone that helps kenneth in doing 
this is not guilty of a crime cherry said 
police homicide lt kyle edwards said his office is 
investigating the death but added it would be up to others to 
decide if any charges could be filed 
at the present time there is a court order that says this is 
not a crime edwards said this is a legal issue thats going 
to go a lot higher than us 
the older bergstedt an amputee who last month was diagnosed as 
suffering from terminal lung cancer had taken care of his son 
since his wife died of lung cancer in 1979 
he said previously he didnt want to see his son die but 
understood his reasons 
lets face it hes been in jail for 21 years and ive been 
his keeper he said 
in asking a judge in june to allow him to end his life kenneth 
bergstedt described his existence as devoid of fulfillment he said 
he spent almost all of his time strapped to a gurney and hooked to 
a respirator passing the hours by watching television or working 
with a specially equipped computer 
cherry told the state supreme court last month that doctors 
wouldnt comply with bergstedts request to provide him with 
sedatives so he could die because they feared civil liability and 
possible criminal charges

state officials sued the national 
republican senatorial campaign committee charging that a gop 
fundraising letter is deceptive and may defraud the public 
the suit filed thursday by attorney general robert j del tufo 
and director of consumer affairs patricia royer asks for a court 
hearing on the committees mailing of 25 checks to residents if a 
person endorses the check and provides a bank account number the 
republican committee is authorized to automatically withdraw 1250 
a month from that persons bank account 
in 20 years of experience with consumer fraud i have never 
before seen this type of fraudulent action said ms royer i 
am very concerned that every con artist out there will use 
automatic funds transfer as a way to defraud the public let this 
quick action serve as a warning that this behavior will not be 
tolerated in new jersey the suit was filed in state superior 
court in essex county it seeks fines costs and restitution of any 
money collected 
ms royer said the terms of the agreement that would allow the 
republican committee to withdraw 1250 a month from residents 
bank accounts are printed on the reverse side of the check 
but the print is so small a person with 2020 vision would 
have a problem reading it without the aid of a magnifier she 
said 
national republican senatorial campaign committee spokeswoman 
wendy burnley sharply denied that the fundraising letter was 
improper suggesting that complaints against it may be politically 
motivated ms burnley acknowledged that the letter has prompted 
complaints in at least six states in addition to new jersey 
illinois and alabama have filed suit against the committee ms 
burnley said the attorneys general of oregon minnesota and 
michigan also have complained she said the letters were sent to 1 
million people nationwide ms burnley said

another republican lost their bids to be dropped from a lawsuit 
charging the springfield police union conspired to disrupt the 
democratic state convention last june 
in a ruling issued thursday in hampden county superior court

democratic committee in its suit against kaufman and stephen 
deangelis a onetime campaign operative for joseph malone a gop 
candidate for state treasurer 
the suit charges that kaufman and deangelis worked with the 
police union in its picketing of the convention which delayed the 
proceedings for four hours and was politically embarrassing for the 
democrats 
simons also ruled that police pickets at the convention had 
verbally and physically assaulted some persons outside the 
convention hall 
simons said the democrats including five convention delegates 
had presented enough facts to support their claims against kaufman 
the unionnews of springfield reported 
the judge also said there is enough of a factual dispute 
over deangelis involvement in the convention disruption to allow 
the case against him to continue 
the judge said the democrats state facts which support their 
allegations about kaufman and allege with specificity that 
kaufman met with planned and assisted the picketing by the police 
union 
kaufman is a deputy assistant to president george bush 
the police union and its president patrolman robert jacobson 
also are defendants in the suit 
the suit includes allegations that the police union violated

filed a 35 million federal racketeering lawsuit against the 
national enquirer and star tabloids over their publication of her 
love letters 
the suit was filed thursday under federal racketeering statutes 
charging copyright infringement conspiracy invasion of property 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the us district court suit seeks 10 million compensatory 
damages and 25 million punitive damages from the national 
enquirer star and the publications owner news america publishing 
inc 
last week elizabeth taylor filed a 20 million libel suit in 
los angeles superior court against the national enquirer for 
alleged false statements 
but miss barr and husband tom arnold are seeking relief under 
the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
known as rico 
the couples lawyer theresa m marchlewski declined comment 
thursday 
the racketeering activity according to the suit involves the 
enquirers alleged participation in a scheme to obtain the 
private papers and effects of celebrities by inducing and paying 
persons and entities to steal such information and transport it in 
interstate commerce 
the couple also seeks the return of miss barrs private 
written letters and outpourings of love and affection to arnold 
embodied in four writings purloined andor published by 
defendants 
excerpts of the letters were published in the feb 6 1990 
issue of the enquirer and the jan 30 1990 edition of the star 
the suit said 
exhibits submitted with the suit included copies of a national 
enquirer cover headline reading roseanne wedding fiasco plus 
amazing honeymoon swimsuit photos 
national enquirer editor iain calder said from his lantana 
fla office that he hadnt seen the suit so he couldnt respond to 
specific allegations 
any legal action against this publication under rico is so 
ridiculous that it is clear this is just another pathetic publicity 
stunt by roseanne calder said 
she is trashing the national enquirer but we are in good 
company a few weeks ago she was trashing the national anthem 
star editor dick kaplan said from tarrytown ny that he would 
have no comment because he hadnt seen the suit 
the lawsuit speaks for itself miss barr and arnold said in 
a statement released by spokeswoman cathy spears 
miss spears said the couple feels the case should be tried in 
court and not in the media according to barr and arnold they 
have suffered grievous injury and will look to the courts to decide 
the issues involved she said 
the suit said the tabloids operate a vast network of 
underground operatives and includes but is not limited to agents 
employees friends relatives and associates of celebrities as well 
as persons and entities who provide goods and services to 
celebrities including plaintiffs 
every member of the tabloids alleged underground enterprise 
conspired with each other to commit the multiple violations of

old sweats british army slang for seasoned 
soldiers has taken on new meaning for britains soldiers sent to 
join the multinational force in the persian gulf 
while the britons swelter in army uniforms designed for cooler 
climes the iraqis weather the heat in special desert uniforms that 
britain sold them four years ago 
the defense ministry said thursday that in 1986 it sold its 
entire stock of desert uniforms to the iraqis thinking that with 
britains reduced defense commitments around the world they would 
no longer be needed 
as a result most of the 9000 british soldiers who began 
arriving in the gulf last week must wear their european camouflage 
uniforms while they await the arrival of new lightweight clothing 
a ministry spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity in 
keeping with standing rules said the uniforms sold to the iraqis 
in 1986 date from the 1960s when british troops were in aden 
the uniforms were sold as a normal turnover of stock the 
present deployment of forces to the gulf was unforeseen she 
said it would not have been economic for the army to hold that 
amount of desert uniforms in stores on a constant basis 
she said new lightweight cotton uniforms will be shipped to the 
british troops soon

an antisemitic quote in an independent 
dartmouth college paper known for its strong criticisms of 
minorities has infuriated people on and off campus who say they 
wont stand for further such incidents 
but trustees and staffers of the dartmouth review insist a 
saboteur placed the adolf hitler quote in the publication and they 
have apologized they further claimed that university president 
james freedman and others have created a lynchmob mentality on 
campus 
about 2000 people attended a rally thursday to denounce the 
quote and the paper history professor bruce nelson told the crowd 
the review lacks a shred of intellectual integrity and that the 
quote is the latest example of the smallminded meanspirited 
scribblings of the local hate sheet 
freedman called the quote an egregious expression of 
antisemitism 
for the last 10 years these shameless voices have ranted that 
dartmouth is for some but not for others he said these voices 
have preached exclusion from the dartmouth family and have expected 
us to heed their words what kind of people did they think we 
were 
even congressmen have responded on thursday 84 representatives 
signed a letter from rep chet atkins dmass to freedman 
denouncing the quote 
recent inclusion of virulent antisemitic remarks has made the 
review worthy of condemnation by all those in this nation who are 
repulsed by wanton expressions of hatred injustice and cruelty 
the letter said 
staffers and trustees at the review say theyve suffered 
unjustly for an act by someone determined to discredit the paper 
trustee dinesh dsouza said students at the paper have received 
death threats and he strongly criticized freedman and others for 
not helping the paper find the perpetrator 
unfortunately dartmouth officials to date have shown no 
interest in uncovering what happened and indeed convened a 
lynchmob to make scapegoats of innocent students dsouza said 
in a total abdication of their leadership and responsibility 
college officials are manipulating the grave issue of antisemitism 
for ends of selfaggrandizement and expediency 
the review published since 1980 has been vilified through the 
years for its views on women homosexuals blacks and indians 
william cole a black music professor resigned in august after 
the review attacked him for seven years in print belittling him as 
a mediocre teacher cole said the attacks compromised his 
effectiveness 
review staffers also were involved in a 1986 sledgehammer attack 
on shanties erected on the campus green as part of a protest 
against segregation in south africa several staffers were 
suspended 
the latest edition of the review was distributed saturday on 
yom kippur the jewish day of atonement and judaisms most solemn 
day the quotation from hitlers mein kampf was inserted 
unattributed into the statement of principles on the reviews 
masthead 
therefore i believe today that i am acting in the sense of 
the almighty creator by warding off the jews i am fighting for 
the lords work 
backlash from the quote caused the reviews president and two 
staffers to quit earlier in the week 
the antisemitic quote was not the first time the paper has 
angered jews in 1988 the review ran a column likening freedman 
whos jewish to hitler and the effects of his campus policies to 
the holocaust 
dsouza said the 1988 column was sophomoric and in bad 
taste he said trustees apologized for it at the time 
dartmouth religion professor arthur hertzberg vice president of 
the world jewish congress called the latest controversy an act 
of hooliganism and attacked the reviews supporters including 
syndicated columnists patrick buchanan and william f buckley and 
the new yorkbased john m olin foundation 
my quarrel is with those who put up hundreds of thousands of 
dollars with which to contaminate this campus he said 
dsouza suggested the quote was surgically implanted he 
pointed to an apostrophe in the quote thats different from the 
type used by paper suggesting it was typed by someone unfamiliar 
with the paper or added by an outsider 
editor in chief kevin pritchett who also has taken over as 
president said he should have been more vigilant i will do 
everything in my power to find the person who did this 
pritchett said that if anything the paper is proisrael he 
also said editors dont check the papers masthead daily so it was 
easy to miss the quote which appeared within the context of the 
reviews normal credo a quote from theodore roosevelt

hundreds of people angry over alleged police 
corruption built barricades and set them on fire today in front of 
1000 riot police who were deployed to try to stop street fighting 
in a rundown neighborhood 
at least 106 people including 83 police have been injured in 
the violence in the nishinari district of osaka that began tuesday 
police reported fortyone people have been arrested 
the people who live in the crimeridden district have 
longstanding grudges against police and accusations made public 
tuesday that a local policeman took a bribe from a gangster helped 
trigger the rioting 
but authorities and residents said young hooligans from outside 
the district and leftist extremists had agitated to keep the 
disturbances going 
the scope of the violence is extremely rare for japan where 
issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree 
about 1000 riot police lined main roads in nishinari and the 
district police station tonight a growing crowd of hundreds faced 
off against the police lines they formed barricades by burning 
piles of bicycles in streets already littered with burned cars and 
other debris 
police officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
another 10000 riot police were on alert in osaka japans no 2 
city to prevent another night of rioting about 100 undercover 
police also were mobilized 
police reported two stores were set ablaze by rioters early 
today and a train station also was damaged by fire 
the rioting caused traffic tieups in parts of osaka as police 
blocked off several major streets and some rail service was 
disrupted many nishinari merchants closed their shops 
outside the police station a group of group shouted insults at 
the police from a loudspeaker and demanded an apology for the 
purported bribery 
dogs of gangsters come out kneel down before us and 
apologize a man screamed through the loudspeaker dont you 
know how much hardship our daily laborers are going through why 
dont you try working at a construction site one day and you will 
probably realize how much we are abused by this society 
the chief of the osaka police headquarters masahiro 
tsubakihara issued an apology thursday in response to reports that 
an officer was involved in scandal kyodo news service reported 
the accused sergeant was arrested wednesday night a day after news 
reports said he took 22000 in bribes from a local gangster for 
information on police operations 
the district is a highcrime area and is known for its gangs 
transient laborers and shabby hotels locals say there have been 
bad feelings between area residents and police who have adopted 
hardline tactics to battle crime including a 24hour surveillance 
camera system on street corners

prosecution efforts to force marlon 
brandos daughter back to the united state from tahiti to testify 
in her brothers murder trial got a boost when a judge agreed to 
delay the trial 
but the endeavor was thwarted at a second hearing thursday when 
another judge refused to order cheyenne brandos return saying he 
lacked the legal right to force her return 
my personal view is that any american citizen who witnesses a 
crime should be made available to testify superior court judge 
joel rudof said thursday but my personal opinion aside the 
question is whether there is legal authority 
in one of her conflicting statements to authorities miss brando 
said she was present during the may 16 shooting of her 26yearold 
boyfriend dag drollet 
christian brando 31 charged with murdering drollet and free on 
2 million bail attended the first hearing thursday in which a 
judge agreed to postpone the trial which had been scheduled to 
start next week 
los angeles county superior court judge robert thomas gave 
prosecutors more time to go forward with legal motions designed to 
obtain miss brandos testimony 
he set a tentative date of nov 5 but said that date could also 
be changed if witnesses are unable to readjust their schedules 
miss brando 20 has been in a sanitarium in tahiti since june 
when she gave birth to drollets child 
to complicate matters drollets parents have charged her under 
french law with complicity in her boyfriends slaying she was 
being held in tahiti by french authorities because of that charge 
and lacks permission to leave even if she decided to come 
voluntarily 
prosecutors said they are not giving up on her return and might 
go back to federal court where they were earlier rebuffed on a 
similar request 
deputy district attorney steven barshop said if all efforts to 
gain miss brandos testimony fail by november he would go ahead 
with trial presenting other witnesses 
the judge explained that the law did not allow him to issue a 
letter of rogatory an international document which the prosecution 
sought to use as a vehicle to compel miss brandos return from 
tahiti 
it seems to me this should be dealt with by the legislature 
rudof said noting that a state court cannot issue such a letter 
although a federal court can 
outside court richard hirsch a lawyer representing miss 
brando said that prosecutors had tried to use a novel view of a 
law normally invoked only as a communications tool between 
governments 
he said the letter of rogatory has never been used in a criminal 
case and was not the proper procedure for compelling miss brandos 
return

lech walesa and prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki once steadfast allies will put their political dispute 
to the voters in the countrys first direct presidential election 
ending weeks of doubt about his intentions mazowiecki declared 
thursday that he will oppose walesa his former mentor in the 
election on nov 25 they are vying to succeed former communist 
leader gen wojciech jaruzelski 
walesa announced his candidacy sept 16 since then he has 
lined up the endorsement of the solidarity trade union which he 
leads several small centerright christiandemocratic parties and 
his own center alliance party 
mazowiecki is supported by a new party citizens movement for 
democratic action and much of the intellectual elite that once 
belonged to solidarity 
as the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister 
mazowiecki introduced the regions most radical economic reform 
plan in january he has taken a stepbystep approach to 
dismantling other aspects of the old regime 
walesa who sponsored mazowiecki for prime minister has accused 
him of moving too slowly 
mazowiecki said thursday he will run for president because 
poland should not stray from the course it has set 
as prime minister mazowiecki is responsible for running the 
government and he is answerable to parliament the presidency the 
governments highest position controls the army and foreign 
affairs 
one has to go forward in a better faster and more sure way 
but along this path not a different one mazowiecki told a 
national television audience thursday as he made his announcement 
poland which has a great chance in todays world and in 
europe should take the place which is due to it of a wise 
country based on christian values of a country of people who are 
tolerant toward each other a country that coexists well with all 
its neighbors he said 
early opinion surveys indicated mazowiecki has more support than 
walesa the 1983 nobel peace prize laureate but walesa appeared to 
be gaining ground in recent weeks 
mazowiecki 63 a journalist and former political prisoner 
became prime minister on aug 24 1989 walesa had engineered the 
solidarity takeover of power after the communists failed to win 
sufficient support to govern in partially free elections that june 
for most of the 1980s mazowiecki was an adviser to walesa but 
last spring walesa began publicly accusing the solidarityled 
government of moving too slowly to privatize the statedominated 
economy and to remove former communists from influential positions 
in the government and economy 
walesa urged new presidential and parliamentary elections and 
raised a general call for acceleration he said he would not 
rest until polands democratic revolution was completed 
supporters of mazowiecki accused walesa of demagoguery and 
personal ambition they argued that mazowieckis choice of a slow 
consistent path to reform is needed to avoid divisive witchhunts 
the presidential office becomes vacant because jaruzelski last 
month asked parliament to shorten his sixyear term after 17 
months 
there had been growing public demands instigated by walesas 
supporters for a popularly elected president and the removal of 
jaruzelski as a symbol of the old system 
as polands leader in 1981 jaruzelski ordered martial law to 
crush solidarity but he then allowed its historic ascension to 
power last year

the african national congress 
at odds with white businessmen over the countrys economic future 
has toned down its socialist policies but still wants to see some 
industries nationalized 
the countrys leading black opposition movement released an 
economic policy document today saying that if it comes to power a 
top priority would be redistributing wealth through affirmative 
action programs favoring blacks 
the anc says it envisions a mixed economy but does not 
believe that market forces alone will result in anything but the 
perpetuation of existing disparities of income 
whites account for only 5 million of the countrys estimated 40 
million people but dominate the economy blacks have an annual per 
capita income of more than 1000 one of the highest in africa 
but only a small fraction of white incomes in the country 
south africa now has one of the most unequal patterns of 
distribution of income and wealth in the world the anc said 
south africas economy the most powerful on the continent 
currently is in a mild recession and has suffered doubledigit 
inflation since the early 1980s 
president fw de klerks government and white businessmen argue 
that socialistoriented policies will produce economic stagnation 
in south africa similar to that in eastern europe 
they say capitalism is the quickest way to raise black living 
standards 
but the anc led by nelson mandela says the government must 
intervene to reduce the gulf between white wealth and black 
poverty 
when mandela was released in february after 27 years in prison 
for plotting against the government he said the anc wanted to 
nationalize gold mines banks and other leading industries 
but the 18page document released today refrained from specific 
calls to nationalize major industries 
it did say however that there might be cases for the 
compulsory establishment of new public enterprises 
the anc also said it was staunchly opposed to current 
government plans to privatize the public utility corporations 
the anc said it would seek to nationalize utilities that are sold 
off 
the anc acknowledged that private enterprise has a major role 
to play in the economy of a democratic nonracial south africa 
the government over decades has built up a huge bureaucracy in 
part to provide jobs for whites about one in three economically 
active whites works for the government 
but de klerk has begun to sell off large state industries 
saying they will be more efficiently run as private companies 
many blacks see the move as an effort to keep the economy in the 
hands of whites now that there is the prospect of a black 
government in the nottoodistant future 
de klerk says he wants to end the apartheid system of racial 
segregation and draw up a new constitution that will allow whites 
and blacks to share power 
debate on the future of the economy has been almost as heated as 
discussion about a political settlement 
the government has been running television commercials and 
placing billboards in black areas saying that capitalism is crucial 
to economic prosperity businessmen have called for government 
deregulation and increased business opportunites for both whites 
and blacks 
but many black antiapartheid groups and black trade unions 
remain strong advocates of socialism the south african communist 
party closely allied to the anc also is committed to socialism

the latest photographs from the crippled hubble 
space telescope have lifted much of the gloom that descended on 
scientists after a focusing flaw was discovered last summer 
at the same time astronomers acknowledge that one of the 15 
billion space observatorys prime missions peering out into the 
farthest reaches of space can not be undertaken until the flaw is 
corrected 
when the space telescope was put into orbit 381 miles above the 
earth by the space shuttle on april 25 scientists were excited by 
the prospect of measuring the speed with which the outermost edges 
of the universe are expanding now that work will have to postponed 
three or four years 
first of all the problem with the optics are there and they 
will have to be fixed that is certainly true said riccardo 
giacconi director of the space telescope science institute 
however the other thing that emerged as a result of the 
photographs is that some of the basic capacity has been 
preserved 
we can use that optical power but only for sources that are 
not too far away that are bright enough 
in practice that means astronomers will have to reorder their 
priorities and the institute is currently reevaluating 160 
research projects originally planned for the hubble giacconi said 
with computer enhancement studies of relatively nearby objects 
and phenomena including novas will be possible with the same 
degree of accuracy as originally envisioned he said 
one photo presented thursday by the science institute offered 
the clearest view yet of enigmatic pluto the ninth and only planet 
that hasnt been visited by a flyby spacecraft and its moon 
charon there also was a shot of startling clarity of saturn 
scientists said that some photographs from hubble had 10 times 
the resolution that would have been possible from earthbound 
telescopes 
the mood at the institute thursday was much improved from last 
summer when it was discovered that a mirror on the telescope had 
manufacturing problems the observatorys initial pictures were 
blurred and of severely limited value to astronomers 
scientists are currently weighing how best to repair flaws in 
the telescopes mirrors a replacement widefield camera is now 
being built at the jet propulsion laboratory in california and 
plans call for it to be delivered to hubble on a space shuttle 
flight in 1993 
engineers plan to install correcting optics in the replacement 
camera to compensate for the flawed mirrors 
within the next few weeks the hubbles spectrographic 
instruments are expected to begin transmitting data back to earth 
on temperature motion and composition of stars results from these 
studies are usually expressed in numbers and graphs not pictures

louisianas us senate race has become a 
headtohead match between nn incumbent democrat reluctantly 
supported by republican party leaders over a republican who was 
once a member of the ku klux klan 
state sen ben bagert dropped out of the primary race thursday 
saying he feared his republican candidacy could force incumbent 
democrat j bennett johnston into a runoff with exklansman and 
republican state rep david duke under louisianas open primary 
system all candidates run on one ballot regardless of party 
affiliation a runoff between the top two finishers is held if no 
one receives a majority of votes 
bagert said his polls indicated he might pull just enough votes 
to keep johnston from getting more than 50 percent of the vote and 
force the threeterm incumbent into a runoff with duke 
gop leaders say such an event would embarrass the state and the 
republican party nationally eight republican senators endorsed 
johnston earlier this week 
im not endorsing anybody but im not voting for david 
duke bagert said asked if he would vote for johnston he said 
yes reluctantly 
bagerts staff said he would file papers today with the 
secretary of states office to formally withdraw from the election 
its too late to get his name off the ballot but if he 
officially withdraws before 6 am saturday any votes cast for him 
will not be counted secretary of state fox mckeithen said 
thursday 
polls show that move should greatly enhance johnstons chances 
of garnering 50 percent and staving off a runoff 
a poll released wednesday by masondixon opinion research of 
columbia md showed johnston was the choice of 53 percent of 
voters surveyed duke drew 26 percent while bagert polled 8 
percent with 13 percent undecided the poll of 825 registered 
voters had a margin of error of 35 percent 
johnston refused to predict that bagerts move would assure him 
victory in saturdays election and added he was making sure now 
that his supporters do not become complacent 
all my supporters understand how important this race is 
johnston said the states on trial the state has a chance to 
show what it is what its values are to the rest of the country 
duke scoffed at the idea that bagerts conservative republican 
support might move to johnstons camp 
they sure dont want a liberal senator to go back there and 
vote for more taxes and for affirmative action he said in a 
television interview 
johnston has often voted a moderatetoconservative line in 
washington supporting defense spending and aid to the nicaraguan 
contras 
but duke and bagert have accused him of being too liberal for 
louisiana citing his role in helping defeat former president 
reagans nomination of judge robert bork to the supreme court and 
his support for the civil rights act of 1990 
meanwhile duke has said his days as a klansman and neonazi are 
behind him but critics say they dont believe him they point to 
his selling of nazi literature from his suburban new orleans 
office a practice he stopped in 1989 after republican leaders 
reported it to the media 
duke ran for president in 1988 first as a democrat later as a 
populist he ran for the state legislature as a republican in 1989 
and won a narrow victory over another republican in an allwhite 
suburban new orleans district

some foreign workers have chosen to 
remain in iraq since the persian gulf crisis began but others 
such as portugese stone masons and soviet oilmen have been held to 
avoid further damage to iraqs economy 
more than 500000 foreign workers have been stranded in iraq 
since it invaded kuwait on aug 2 and the united states and other 
countries responded by massing troops in the gulf region to deter 
possible further aggression 
the iraqis hold 2200 westerners in kuwait and iraq some at 
strategic installations to discourage an attack by the usled 
military forces 
some foreign workers have stayed willingly preferring the 
certainty of a paycheck to unknown job prospects at home diplomats 
said 
but the diplomats most of whom spoke on condition of anonymity 
said many other workers who want to leave have found most avenues 
blocked by bureaucracy 
iraq suffering the effects of the unimposed economic 
sanctions has kept many workers in the country to keep the economy 
running even diverting some to areas in need of a boost such as 
agriculture the diplomats said 
about 4500 soviet oil industry workers are in iraq and a 
foreign source in baghdad said the iraqis are dependent on them 
if they go no one else will come in to operate these 
fields the source said 
polish work crews building roads pipelines and railroads also 
are helping iraqs industries and projects limp along many iraqi 
construction projects were halted when the un economic embargo 
cut off imports 
the stranded foreigners also include 25 portuguese stone masons 
who last month completed marble work on a palace for iraqi 
president saddam hussein the portugese foreign ministry in lisbon 
said 
officials disagree over whether such work violates the un 
embargo and the responsibilities of the foreign workers 
as far as i understand working there would violate the 
sanctions swedish foreign ministry spokesman larsolof lundberg 
said wednesday 
the british government is more flexible 
like many governments we have concluded that it is 
unreasonable to ask people who are essentially working under duress 
to stop working and put themselves at risk a foreign office 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
un directives regarding the sanctions are open to 
interpretation a dutch foreign ministry spokeswoman said 
she said the status of a dredging project in southern iraq 
employing 104 dutch citizens is unclear but there is speculation 
the dredgers are being forced to work 
officials said many bangladeshis egyptians indians pakistanis 
and sri lankans are being kept at their old jobs also about 2000 
bangladeshis are working as forced labor in iraqi military 
camps in kuwait a foreign ministry official in dhaka said this 
week 
iraq is trying to grow more crops because of the trade embargo 
and some third world laborers who were working on canceled projects 
have been diverted to agriculture a source in baghdad said 
agriculture minister abdul wahab mahmoud said in a report 
published thursday that iraqi farmers must redouble their efforts 
to grow more grain 
the iraqis are slow about giving exit visas delaying but not 
preventing some workers from leaving a european diplomat said this 
week 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman yuri gremitskikh told 
reporters tuesday that iraq has been slow responding to requests to 
allow the oil workers to leave 
regrettably the iraqi authorities clearly show tardiness in 
considering the documents submitted by the soviet side he said 
but some workers have managed to leave after weeks of pleas and 
paperwork 
a plane carrying 173 brazilians mainly weapons technicians and 
idled construction workers left baghdad on wednesday after appeals 
and visits by highranking brazilian officials eightytwo 
brazilians remain in iraq 
several hundred bulgarians are stranded in iraq as well as 66 
czechs about half of whom are working on an irrigation project 
officials said 
of nearly 10000 yugoslavs working in construction prior to the 
gulf crisis less than 200 remain and are reportedly working on a 
hydroelectric project 
about 5000 chinese are also in iraq mostly construction 
workers under statearranged contracts

doctors who hoped to test a french abortion 
pill must now convince its manufacturer which called off testing 
because of public outcry against the drug 
state health authorities have indicated willingness to approve a 
test program for ru486 at the university of california at san 
francisco but it needs further information from the manufacturer 
rousseluclaf and the researchers need to have the drug itself 
ru486 is not approved for general sale in the united states 
in february rousseluclaf stopped providing ru486 to the 
university of california at los angeles for tests there 
the french company explained the move by saying an abortion pill 
is too controversial for america 
we think public and political opinion in the states is not 
ready to accept either abortion or 486 said ariel mouttet the 
international products manager for rousseluclaf we will resume 
testing it in the states when the debate and the climate on 
abortion has been resolved 
the drug is taken in the first seven weeks of pregnancy under a 
doctors supervision it prevents fertilized eggs from implanting 
in the uterus 
dr marcus conant heading the group that wants to test the drug 
here said its program would administer ru486 with the hormone 
prostaglandin which causes uterine contractions and reduces the 
risk of hemorrhaging tests at ucla did not include prostaglandin 
conant said state regulators have told us our application 
looks really good 
they have indicated a willingness to approve our testing 
protocol for ru 486 but they need information that only the 
french company can provide conant said and we need access 
to the drug 
testing of ru486 has backing from such groups as planned 
parenthood and the american medical association antiabortion 
groups oppose it they have threatened to boycott the products of 
rousseluclaf if ru486 becomes available in the united states 
conant and san francisco epidemiologist steve heilig said they 
hope to meet with rousseluclaf representatives by early next year 
to urge them to allow testing to continue 
we think we have a chance to convince them because theyre 
finally moving the drug into britain and scandinavia heilig 
said weve had some meetings with them in france and were 
making some progress 
ru486 was approved in france in 1988 rousseluclaf says it has 
been used with 96 percent success by more than 55000 women

one of three britons who made a daring escape from 
iraq by boat said today other expatriates shouldnt try to escape 
the same way because it is too risky 
speaking to reporters upon their arrival at londons heathrow 
airport keith barkworth 36 mike teesdale 40 and ivan manning 
44 said many westerners in iraq were plotting escapes 
while barkworth said he wouldnt recommend his own escape rout 
to others because it was too risky teesdale said he had tried 
it because i have got a wife and two children and thought i had 
outstayed my welcome in iraq 
the britons escaped with two frenchmen amedee du paty 53 and 
janel cellier de buriane 55 
the five men bobbed for 25 hours in a 10foot boat in rough seas 
before being rescued off the saudi arabian coast near khafji 
it was the first report of western men escaping from iraq in 
over six weeks baghdad has kept thousands of western men from 
leaving both iraq and kuwait since its aug 2 invasion 
the men said they planned their escape for over a month 
it was mohammeds birthday a religious festival and a 
revolutionary holiday so we felt they would be more relaxed than 
normal manning said 
we couldnt let anyone know that we had gone we needed at 
least 10 hours to get clear of iraq and if we had told anyone they 
might have thought it safe to tell others within two or three 
hours 
just before they were rescued the men said they saw what they 
believed to be three warships on the horizon they suspected they 
were not iraqi and decided to approach 
the ships turned out to be two platforms and a barge and the 
men were greeted by a fellow briton and brought on board for food 
and a bath 
the three escaped britons who had been working in the iraqi 
port of basra were reunited with their wives and families today 
it is a marvelous feeling to be home teesdale said as he 
hugged his wife margaret

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
today he will oppose any effort to cut farm subsidies more than the 
amount specified in the defeated 500 billion deficitreduction 
package 
yeutter in a statement said parochial interests overwhelmed 
the national interest in thursday nights 254179 house defeat of 
the budget agreement 
the house did not have the political courage to cut 
entitlement programs and it was unwilling to increase revenues in 
areas which add little or nothing to us productivity he said 
this betrayal of political responsibility makes many 
meritorious agricultural programs even more vulnerable to cuts than 
before yeutter said i will strongly resist any efforts to cut 
agricultural expenditures further in any future budget 
agreements 
yeutter termed the agreements 13 billion cut in farm programs 
a heavy hit on agriculture 
but had the agreement been approved he said interest rates 
probably would have declined and that would be good news for 
farmers since it had been estimated over five years they would 
save about 5 billion in interest costs and 35 billion on other 
production expenses

a propane tank truck halted at the usmexico 
border for being overweight also held an estimated 35 tons of 
cocaine the customs service said 
federal agents still were tallying the exact amount early today 
upon verification it is likely that this will be the largest 
seizure of cocaine ever made at the ports of entry along the 
californiamexico border said quintin villanueva the customs 
services western regional commissioner 
ron dulisse a drug enforcement administration spokesman said 
that if the estimated amount of cocaine is correct it would have a 
wholesale value of about 85 million and a street value in san 
diego of about 340 million 
the hidro gas juarez truck had been stopped wednesday and held 
overnight at the otay mesa border crossing in eastern san diego 
county because it weighed more than it should have 
after waiting more than a day to drain the highly flammable 
propane drugsniffing dogs alerted inspectors to the presence of 
narcotics late thursday 
before the cocaine was found customs inspectors had been 
legally required to release the trucks driver a mexican national 
whose name was withheld 
we started looking for narcotics by searching the tires and 
by the very nature of the truck the inspection was a very 
dangerous job and we were proceeding cautiously said the acting 
customs district director tom hardy 
the driver faces 10 years to life in prison and fines up to 4 
million if apprehended and convicted of smuggling charges 
the largest previous cocaine seizure at a californiamexico 
border crossing was 1290 pounds in 1988 the worlds largest 
cocaine haul of 215 tons with an estimated street value of 20 
billion was made in september 1989 at a warehouse in sylmar near

fire chief harold watkins said the fourstory 76yearold 
building also lacked sprinklers many of the injured suffered from 
smoke inhalation while others suffered broken bones from their 
leaps he said 
we tried to stop them from jumping watkins said of those 
who leaped from the upper floors we said the ladders would be 
there but the smoke was just too much for them they just couldnt 
stand it they jumped

a cult leaders son was sentenced today 
to a minimum 120 years in prison for the slayings of four members 
of a family killings he blamed on his father 
damon lundgren 19 appeared calm and stood with his hands 
folded while lake county common pleas judge paul h mitrovich 
pronounced his sentence 
mitrovich ordered that lundgren serve four consecutive 
20yeartolife sentences on aggravated murder convictions and four 
consecutive 10to25year sentences on kidnapping convictions 
lundgren was convicted last month on four counts each of 
aggravated murder and kidnapping in the shooting deaths of dennis 
avery and averys three young daughters he was acquitted in the 
death of averys wife cheryl 
the averys were led one by one into the barn bound and gagged 
with duct tape then shot and dumped into a common grave at a farm 
the cult rented in nearby kirtland about 30 miles east of 
cleveland authorities found te bodies in january 
thirteen cult members were arrested some have pleaded guilty to 
reduced charges 
damons father jeffrey lundgren said during his own sentencing 
hearing that he killed the averys because his interpretation of 
scriptures showed them to be sinners he was sentenced to death in 
the electric chair 
the cult leaders wife alice lundgren got five consecutive 
life sentences for conspiracy complicity and kidnapping 
mitrovich chastised lundgren for showing no remorse for his role 
in the killings 
you accept no blame you blame your father you claim this was 
your fathers doing and none of your own but jeffrey lundgren 
could not have done anything without the help and devotion of you 
and his other followers the judge said society cannot 
tolerate such excuses 
you apologized for what your father did and for what happened 
to the averys but you did not apologize for your own part 
defense attorney albert purola said the sentence was expected 
special prosecutor joseph gurley said we expected no less 
the jury had found he was an active participant and found him 
guilty of these four murders and the judge in our opinion imposed 
the appropriate sentence 
defense attorneys argued that damon lundgren was so strictly 
raised and heavily controlled by his father that the youth was 
unable to disobey the cult leaders orders to help wrestle at least 
one victim to the ground and help bind and gag him 
they also argued that the younger lundgren did not actually pull 
the trigger 
the elder lundgren sometimes would put a gun to his sons head 
and tell his son to trust him damon said during his sentencing 
hearing 
i was afraid that if i disobeyed him i would end up just like 
those other people that died he said as far as my father was 
concerned those people disobeyed him and he killed them

tropical storm klaus gained 
strength off antigua today and was upgraded to a hurricane after 
leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the 
caribbean island of martinique 
the national hurricane center in miami said klaus had sustained 
winds of 80 mph this morning up from 60 mph earlier it remained 
stalled 30 miles off antigua but was expected to start moving again 
later 
it was uncertain whether klaus the sixth named hurricane of the 
season would reach the united states 
we expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the 
northwest and to be north of puerto rico and east of the bahamas 
beyond that its too early to say said bob sheets director of 
the miami hurricane center 
antiguas international airport was closed said stan 
cieniewicz administrative officer for the islandbased 
pancaribbean disaster preparedness and prevention project 
he said klaus was expected to cut between antigua a popular 
tourist spot and its tiny sister island barbuda 
both islands are mainly flat but barbudas 1500 population is 
located almost entirely in the capital codrington protected by a 
reef and lagoon 
early today antigua was being swept by high winds and 
intermittent rain but there were no reports of damage 
antiguas government radio station abs said schools were 
closed and residents were stocking up on supplies it advised 
residents to stay indoors later both abs and another staion were 
knocked off the air by the winds 
authorities on thursday evacuated hundreds of residents from the 
french island of martinique where the storm left floodwaters 
nearly 10 feet deep in some places the dead and missing were 
reported on that island 
hurricane warnings were issued for the leeward islands along an 
arc from the french and dutch island of st martin in the north to 
the british colony of montserrat in the south tropical storm 
warnings remained in effect for martinique and its sister island of 
guadeloupe 
it stalled again just hasnt moved i think later today itll 
resume the northwestward drift said hurricane specialist max 
mayfield at the miami center i think the problem will come in 
two to three days when it gets to the northern caribbean 
the hurricane center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was 
possible for the islands of the northeastern caribbean that amount 
could trigger mudslides and more flash flooding 
at noon edt klaus was centered near latitude 172 north and 
longitude 613 west or about 30 miles eastnortheast of antigua 
the systems hurricaneforce winds extended 30 miles from its 
center and tropicalstorm forces 115 miles out 
in barbados southeast of martinique floodwaters forced the 
evacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked some 
roads although the major tourist hotels on the western coast were 
unaffected 
islands covered by hurricane warnings included st martin st 
barthelemy saba st eustatius antigua and barbuda anguilla the 
british virgin islands montserrat and st kittsnevis 
many of the same islands were battered by hurricane hugo which 
devastated the region in september 1989 before hitting the carolina 
coast 
meanwhile tropical storm josephine downgraded last week to a 
depression strengthened in the midatlantic to a hurricane late 
thursday josephine with top winds of 75 mph was reported at noon 
edt to be heading northeast at 16 mph about 750 miles southwest of 
the midatlantic azores archipelago 
josephine the fifth named hurricane of the season posed no 
immediate threat to land located at latitude 326 north and

some swedes were in an uproar friday 
over their kings unprecedented comment that the swedish work ethic 
leaves something to be desired 
i suppose that we maybe should think about the swedish work 
ethic and try and improve it in one way or the other i assume 
were all aware that it is not the best king carl xvi gustaf 
44 told dagens industri in an interview thursday 
the swedish monarch very rarely speaks out on political or 
controversial matters 
reaction came swiftly some people agreed with the king but 
others suggested he was speaking for himself and his acquaintances 
i wonder if he ever tried to work himself said librarian 
anna simkutte labeling the royal comment utmost rubbish 
i suppose that the king makes his statement from the circles 
where he dwells himself in that case thats an interesting 
insight into those circles the aftonbladet newspaper quoted 
labor federation spokesan staffan kellerborg as saying 
a shoe repairman who did not give his name told the associated 
press he agreed with the king to some extent 
there are supposed to be people who can live well between four 
to eight years without lifting a finger he said but i think 
that the majority works 
critics have said the generous swedish system for sick leave 
holidays and unemployment insurance encourages absenteeism and 
makes some swedishmade products too expensive 
the kings duties include traveling abroad to promote swedish 
industries he owns large estates and holds mostly a symbolic 
function as a constitutional monarch

a prosecutor said today that sexually graphic 
photographs by robert mapplethorpe were convincing evidence in 
themselves for a conviction in the obscenity trial of an art 
gallery and its director 
but a lawyer for the contemporary arts center said the state 
failed to show that the exhibit lacked artistic merit 
the contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie 
are charged with one count each of pandering obscenity and one 
count each of using children in nudityrelated material 
the misdemeanor charges stem from the exhibit robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment which appeared in cincinnati 
for seven weeks last spring 
barrie could be sentenced to a year in jail and fined 2000 if 
convicted of both counts the gallery could be fined 10000 
frank prouty an assistant city prosecutor said in his closing 
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men 
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were 
enough for convictions the charges against the gallery and its 
director dennis barrie were based on those seven pictures in the 
175photo exhibit 
the pictures speak for themselves prouty told the jury in 
hamilton county municipal court the pictures are the issue 
marc mezibov the gallerys lawyer said the state failed to 
prove its case against the center and barrie no presentation was 
made to back up the assertion that the photographs were not 
legitimate art 
have you thought why it is that no one for the state of ohio 
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic 
value dont you think that if there were people out there who 
thought that the state of ohio would have found them mezibov 
said 
barries attorney h louis sirkin was scheduled to present his 
closing remarks later friday and the case was expected to go to 
the jury 
defense lawyers thursday challenged the credentials of the 
prosecutions only expert witness judith reisman on grounds that 
she was not qualified but judge david albanese ruled she could 
testify 
ms reisman said her qualifications included having prepared 
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the smithsonian 
institution 
she also worked as a consultant for televisions captain 
kangaroo show for former attorney general edwin meeses 
commission on pornography and for the onservative american family 
association 
at issue in the trial are seven photographs a grand jury cited 
from the 175photo exhibit five of the pictures depict sexually 
explicit acts involving men and two show children with their 
genitals exposed 
ms reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a 
prelude to sexual abuse 
we are putting at risk additional children because many people 
see themselves as photographers and many people do use the 
technique of telling children this is appropriate because this is 
in a museum this is appropriate because it is in a book she 
said 
that happens to be a standard technique for getting children 
into a child sexabuse situation 
defense experts have testified that mapplethorpe who died last 
year of aids at age 42 was an accomplished and respected 
photographer and that photographs of the children were morally and 
sexually innocent 
the exhibit drew more than 80000 people during its sevenweek 
run an attendance record for an art exhibit in cincinnati it 
closes this week in boston where 103000 tickets have been sold

a dozen more crimes would be subject to the 
federal death penalty and executions would be carried out more 
quickly under amendments approved by law and orderminded house 
members 
i hope we never bring up another crime bill a month before an 
election rep william hughes dnj said thursday as the house 
bowed to conservative demands for a major reshaping of the measure 
hughes said campaign considerations were overshadowing the 
debate but critics of the bill said stern measures were needed to 
curb mounting crime 
sarcastic cries of kill kill kill wafted through the house 
as lawmakers added harsh provisions that rep george gekas rpa 
said were being demanded by the cop on the beat and the man on 
the street 
the bill calls for the death penalty for more than 20 federal 
crimes including provisions added thursday imposing capital 
punishment for murder aboard trains planes and automobiles as well 
as in mail bombings bank robberies and elsewhere 
assassination or attempted assassination of the president would 
be punishable by death under the bill as would treason and 
espionage 
the house today voted 216204 to leave in the bill a provision 
allowing death row inmates to use racial statistics in their 
appeals to show the sentencing courts were biased 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis offered the amendment that 
would have stripped the provision from the bill supporters of the 
amendment said the provision would dramtically weaken and perhaps 
abolish use of the death penalty opponents said there was 
indisputable evidence that blacks are more likely to be sentenced 
to die than are whites 
president bush and congressional conservatives have been highly 
critical of the provision which was dropped from a senatepassed 
version of the crime bill 
the house dealt bush a victory thursday by toughening provisions 
giving death row inmates a time limit for filing habeas corpus 
petitions claiming they have been treated unconstitutionally 
some convicts have filed one such petition after another in 
some cases using the process to escape the death chamber for a 
decade or more 
lawmakers adopted 285146 a substitute plan by rep henry j 
hyde rill that would let states impose a time limit and place 
curbs on repeated petitions hyde said it would stop endless 
endless endless delays 
over 2350 murderers on death row are waiting for something to 
happen hyde said in urging approval of the measure 
the version dropped from the bill would have limited priooners 
to one petition and required competent lawyers for them but 
critics said exceptions contained in the provision would have 
resulted in even longer delays 
tempers frayed as the house prepared to approve a proposal by 
gekas to make a dozen more crimes subject to the death penalty 
rep craig washington dtexas complained that gekas had not 
answered his question on how it would work 
gekas said it wasnt a good question and washington 
shouted you wouldnt know a good question if you heard it 
the house approved the gekas plan 271159 
as the bill came to the floor it would have banned domestic 
manufacture of any of the semiautomatic assault rifles whose 
importation has been banned by bush the president acted in 
response to complaints that the militarystyle weapons were 
designed for killing humans rather than for sporting purposes 
however the house adopted 257172 an amendment by rep jolene 
unsoeld dwash that would allow domestic manufacture of the 
rifles as long as the parts were americanmade 
handgun control inc a washingtonbased group that campaigns 
for firearms restrictions released a report from unsoelds 
campaign committee to the federal election commission showing a 
4950 contribution from the national rifle association shortly 
after the amendment was introduced 
the group said in a statement that unsoeld sold her political 
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope that it will help her 
get elected 
absolute baloney unsoeld replied she said she had not 
discussed the amendment with the nra before introducing it and had 
not known about the campaign contribution at the time 
the amendment was needed she said because there are a lot of 
us who support the second amendment right to bear arms who would 
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise

the oregon governors race once was dismissed 
by some as a nearcertain gop gain but the contest has come to life 
as the candidates hammer each other on crime and other issues 
a poll released this week showed democratic secretary of state 
barbara roberts pulling even with republican attorney general dave 
frohnmayer who earlier had been seen as the heavy favorite 
if im not careful i may lose my underdog status roberts 
quipped in a debate on thursday 
i think its an inevitable narrowing said frohnmayer im 
just happy that this notion of frontrunner is put to rest so 
people can really focus on the differences between the 
candidates 
roberts tv ads cast frohnmayer as an ineffectual attorney 
general who has done little about oregons crime and drug problems 
frohnmayers ads attack roberts record on crime one charges 
that the former state legislator voted against a bill allowing 
policewomen to carry radios they could use to call for help if 
attacked by a suspected rapist 
both candidates are crying foul over the others advertisements 
frohnmayer accused roberts of false advertising 
daves been painting a picture of me i hardly recognize 
roberts maintained dont be fooled by fancy brush strokes 
just a few months ago some observers had written off the 
governors race as a snoozer in which roberts was a hopeless 
underdog against the betterfinanced frohnmayer 
a lot of people think the race is already over state gop 
chairman craig berkman said in july 
but a poll published in thursdays oregonian showed the 
candidates neckandneck with frohnmayer favored by 44 percent of 
those surveyed and roberts by 43 percent the sept 2530 survey 
had a 4 percentage point margin of error 
roberts also announced this past week that she had raised 13 
million for her campaign considered a respectable amount for 
someone who got a relatively late start in the race 
frohnmayer had raised 2 million in campaign contributions as of 
june his next campaign finance report is due monday 
roberts jumped into the race one day after democratic gov neil 
goldschmidts surprise announcement in february that he would not 
seek a second term because of marital problems 
frohnmayer one of oregons best known political figures 
already had spent months putting together an aggressive campaign 
also in the race are independent al mobley a staunch 
antiabortionist who says roberts and frohnmayer are too liberal 
and libertarian fred oerther who has mounted no visible campaign 
mobley is seen as a possible spoiler in the race since any 
votes he gets in november probably will be at frohnmayers expense 
in the oregonian poll mobley was supported by 7 percent of those 
surveyed and oerther was backed by fewer than 1 percent 
frohnmayer and roberts meanwhile have been going at each other 
for weeks mainly over the crime issue 
the two candidates also have argued over a measure on the nov 6 
ballot to force a shutdown of the states only nuclear power plant 
until the federal government licenses a permanent disposal site for 
radioactive waste 
roberts said she supports the measure because of concerns about 
onsite storage of waste at the trojan nuclear plant located near 
the columbia river 
frohnmayer opposes the shutdown saying it would leave the state 
vulnerable to future energy shortages and cost utility customers 
millions of dollars to pay for replacement energy sources 
the candidates also have clashed over proposals to lock away 
more old growth trees from logging to protect habitat for the 
northern spotted owl frohnmayer has emphasized his support for the 
timber industry and criticized roberts for not challenging a 
federal scientists report recommending forest preserves for the 
owl

the lawmakers arraigned today were charged friday in the second 
round of indictments following the 16month fbi sting

buying 
house speaker bob sheehan a democrat suspended the indicted 
lawmakers friday

whether to allow parimutuel betting in south carolina a fifth 
state rep luther taylor is scheduled to stand trial later this 
month

accepting 2000 and tampering with a witness he faces up to 50 
years in prison and a fine of 750000 
andy savage limehouses lawyer indicated he will question 
whether charges could be brought under the hobbs act since the 
alleged bribes may not have affected interstate commerce

there is an impact on interstate commerce

police said today they were 
lifting a 10dayold nighttime curfew in the black township of 
soweto because a sharp drop in political violence and crime no 
longer made the restrictions necessary 
police imposed the 9 pm4 am curfew sept 25 in soweto and 
other nearby townships to halt black factional fighting around 
johannesburg that has claimed 800 lives in the past two months 
only scattered incidents have been reported in recent weeks and 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said serious crime in soweto 
had dropped by about twothirds as compared to the 10 days before 
the curfew 
vlok praised residents in soweto for outstanding cooperation 
with the police soweto just outside johannesburg is the 
countrys largest township with 25 million inhabitants 
the curfew will remain in effect in several other townships 
police said 
the african national congress the leading black opposition 
movement has opposed the curfew saying it was implemented to 
weaken the normal organizational activities of the anc 
however many soweto residents said the curfew while 
inconvenient has made the township safer 
in other developments today nelson mandela and other anc

many of the inmates on oregons death row are 
headed back to new sentencing hearings in the states already 
sluggish court system because of a us supreme court ruling 
its not going to shut the system down but anything with a 
death penalty attached to it takes more time and effort than those 
cases without the death penalty said phil lemman an assistant 
to state attorney general dave frohnmayer 
the us supreme court agreed monday with the oregon supreme 
court that three death sentences should be overturned 
the state court had said that because of a 1989 us supreme 
court decision the defendants were entitled to have mitigating 
evidence presented to the sentencing jury 
the result is that many of the 23 men sentenced to death before 
the 1989 decision may qualify for new sentencing hearings 
oregons capital punishment law passed by voters in 1984 
establishes a twostep court proceeding 
the jury first decides whether a defendant is guilty of 
aggravated murder if guilty the jury decides whether the 
defendant should die by injection 
under the initial version of the law a death sentence was 
imposed if the jury unanimously found the defendant posed a future 
threat of violence acted deliberately in the killing and killed 
without provocation 
the 1989 legislature revised the law to take into account the 
us supreme court ruling the oregon supreme court then fashioned 
an additional question on mitigating circumstances for jurors to 
consider 
the court said the jury can weigh any aspect of a defendants 
background or any circumstances of the offense that would justify 
life imprisonment instead 
frohnmayer appealed the state supreme court ruling arguing that 
it went far beyond constitutional requirements he said mitigating 
factors for the jury to consider should be limited to those bearing 
on a defendants moral blameworthiness 
lemman said it will be some time before its determined how many 
new sentencing proceedings will be needed 
in any case he said the sessions will require time and 
expense 
these are not going to be quick twohour hearings he said 
the law allows evidence from the trial to submitted to the 
sentencing jury and witnesses can be recalled to testify new 
lawyers also could be involved 
the chief criminal judge in multnomah county which has the 
states biggest trial court system said new death sentence 
proceedings will add to the work but probably wont disrupt court 
dockets 
circuit judge philip abraham said it appears up to six 
deathsentence cases will require new hearings in his county 
it will impact the system somewhat but i dont see it as 
insurmountable abraham said 
his court system handles about 5000 felony cases annually and 
had 31 murder cases pending at the beginning of october 
the oregon supreme court already had sent eight death penalty 
cases back to trial courts for new sentencing hearings at the time 
of the us supreme court decision 
prosecutors have the option of seeking life terms instead of 
death sentences and one district attorney so far has case has 
decided on a life sentence 
in three other cases death sentences were set aside when murder 
convictions were reversed by the state supreme court 
all death sentence cases automatically are appealed to the state 
supreme court

dress 
the princess planned to discuss her interest in aids patients 
with the first lady before heading to grandmas house a washington 
home for young aids victims 
diana attended a charity gala thursday night to benefit the 
home several prominent organizers boycotted the event on the 
grounds the ticket prices were too high 
the princess was aware of the controversy said british embassy 
spokesman francis cornish he said he did not know her opinion of 
the ticket prices but he said you cant wander into somebody 
elses country and say somethings too steep the minimum ticket 
price was 2500 but most people paid 3500 which included the 
honor of shaking dianas hand 
despite the acrimony that arose over ticket prices cornish said 
diana enjoyed the charity event and thought everybody else who 
turned up did 
diana wore a fuchsia silk offtheshoulder dress to the gala 
she entered to the strains of handels water music and presided 
over a table that included two of president bushs children marvin 
bush and dorothy leblond 
in addition to grandmas house the gala benefitted the 
washington ballet the london city ballet and the britishamerican 
arts association

had longstanding interests in those areas 
she is patron of london city ballet and has been involved with

continued late into the evening at the benefit 
a number of women on the events organizing committee did not 
attend among them television personality barbara walters and 
georgette mosbacher wife of commerce secretary robert mosbacher 
the ostensible reason was that ticket prices at 2500 or 
3500 were too high mrs mosbacher asked for her money back 
said joanna seymour media manager for london city ballet 
celebrities who did show up included patricia hearst democratic 
fundraiser pamela harriman transportation secretary samuel skinner

a success 
seymour said the two ballet companies and grandmas house would 
each receive more than 100000 the arts association was in line 
for at least 20000 she said 
seymour said ticket prices were discussed ad nauseum and 
determined in consultation with the british and us organizing 
committees the bottom line she said is that 260 tickets were 
sold and money was raised 
its not a matter of who buys the tickets seymour said 
this is not an evening for people to see and be seen at this is 
an evening to raise serious money for worthwhile charities

an elaborate pastry and fruit dessert on plates individually 
decorated with chocolate designs before serving wine champagne 
and cognac were donated along with 500 gold chairs flown in from 
britain to match the flatware 
overhead was expected to be low because most costs were picked 
up by adt the chief sponsor of the gala and other corporate 
contributors 
adt describes itself as the leading provider of electronic 
security protection and vehicle auction services with operations 
throughout north america the united kingdom and continental 
europe

the education department friday said harvard 
university has been cleared of charges its undergraduate admission 
policies discriminate against asianamerican applicants 
michael williams assistant secretary for civil rights said an 
examination of records found asian americans were admitted to 
harvard at a lower rate than white applicants mainly because of the 
preference given to children of alumni and recruited athletes 
groups in which there are few asian americans 
while these preferences have an adverse effect on asian 
americans we determined that they were longstanding and 
legitimate and not a pretext for discrimination said williams 
who made completing reviews at harvard and ucla his highest 
priority when he joined the agency in july 
on monday the department announced a finding of discrimination 
against asian americans seeking admission to the university of 
california at los angeles graduate mathematics program ucla now 
must offer admission to five asianamerican students who had been 
discriminatorily denied admission 
williams said the office of civil rights could find no evidence 
of a quota at harvard limiting asian americans who have gone from 
being 55 percent of the class in 1983 to being 196 percent of the 
class of 1994 
the twoyear investigation included a review of thousands of 
applicant files and 10 years of applicant data provided by harvard 
as well as dozens of interviews with staff and other individuals 
williams said 
investigatios have been conducted in response to complaints 
alleging that several schools including harvard and ucla were in 
violation of title vi of the 1964 civil rights act the law 
stipulates that recipients of federal funds cannot discriminate on 
the basis of race color or national origin

stefano casiraghi princess carolines husband 
will be buried at a private chapel overlooking the sea in which he 
died the royal palace said friday 
the palace said the private burial service would take place 
immediately after a public funeral saturday at the cathedral of 
monaco 
prior to the announcement there had been uncertainty whether 
casiraghi would be buried in the principality or in italy where 
his parents live 
casiraghis speedboat flipped over wednesday during the world 
offshore championships 
residents of monaco were allowed to view casiraghis body 
thursday at a mortuary near princess grace hospital 
on friday a palace spokesman said the coffin was closed and 
taken to the palace for a private family mass 
the funeral service is scheduled for late saturday morning at a 
115yearold cathedral situated just below the palace it can 
accommodate more than 2000 people 
casiraghi who was 30 is to be buried in the chapelle de la 
paix also buried in the private chapel is another commoner who 
married into the royal family dancer john gilpin the late 
husband of prince raniers sister antoine 
after the burial some of casiraghis fellow speedboat racers 
plan to ride aboard a yacht to the site where the accident occurred 
and lay a wreath in his memory 
an italian newspaper il secolo xix of genoa reported friday 
that casiraghis parents were deeply irritated by the royal 
familys decision to display the coffin at the mortuary rather than 
in the palace 
the newspaper citing unnamed sources also reported that the 
casiraghis and the royal family were at odds about whether the 
funeral and burial should be in monaco or italy 
the speedboat championships in which casiraghi was seeking to 
defend his world title were canceled after crews from the other 41 
boats withdrew 
casiraghi had been racing at worldclass level since 1984 he 
had told friends he planned to quit after this season 
casiraghis death came eight years after carolines mother 
princess grace was killed in a car accident 
he and caroline were married on dec 29 1983 in a civil 
ceremony they had three children

stocks and bonds staged a strong recovery today 
after diving in reaction to house rejection of president bushs 
plan to reduce the budget deficit 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks the bestknown 
measurement of the stock market tumbled nearly 70 points when 
trading began but recovered by early afternoon it was up 25 
points to the 2540 level 
traders said stocks received a boost when britain announced that 
the pound will enter europes exchange rate mechanism effective 
monday that lifted share prices in london and the enthusiasm 
transferred to new york 
the opening plunge triggered an nyse restraint on computerized 
selling strategies aimed at helping stabilize the market an 
outgrowth of the stock market crash nearly three years ago 
concern over rising oil prices and persistent turmoil in the 
persian gulf contributed to the drop 
but traders apparently decided to place concern over the budget 
crisis on hold 
everybodys disappointed by the budget pact failure but in 
the end i think people have decided not to let it bother them for 
awhile said dudley eppel a strategist with donaldson lufkin amp 
jenrette securities corp 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of the economy and 
interest rates the key 30year treasury bond was down about 2 per 
1000 face amount after falling close to 6 earlier in the day 
its yield which rises when the price falls rose to 881 percent 
from 879 percent late thursday 
the house voted 254179 early today to spurn bushs plan aimed 
at trimming 500 billion from the staggering federal deficit that 
is keeping interest rates high 
the rejection doused investor hopes that the federal reserve 
would take quick action to lower interest rates which would have 
tended to make stocks and bonds more valuable 
economists said investors also remained anxious about a possible 
outbreak of war in the 2monthold persian gulf crisis which has 
doubled the price of oil since early this summer and raised the 
threat of acute inflation

iraqs foreign minister today accused the 
united states and its allies of bringing the entire world to the 
brink of a devastating war in a quest to gain control of the 
middle easts oil 
in a prepared speech tariq aziz said the un security council 
was hypocritical when it penalized iraq for its invasion of kuwait 
while allowing israel to continue occupying arab lands seized in 
1967 and 1973 wars 
he proposed that all middle east problems palestine 
lebanon the gulf and others be considered on the same basis 
an iraqi envoy was to read the aziz speech to the general 
assembly this evening a text of the speech was obtained in advance 
by the associated press 
aziz did not come to new york to deliver the speech because the 
united states denied landing rights for the plane the iraqi 
delegation has used in the past proposing instead that aziz take a 
commercial flight 
the foreign minister said in the speech that america and its 
allies are seeking to gain control over the oil reserves in the 
gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the 
world and especially the needs of the peoples of the third world 
for this important commodity 
he accused iraqs foes of deploying fleets aircraft and 
ground forces in the region in a way that has no parallel in 
contemporary history thus bringing the entire region nay the 
entire world to the brink of a devastating war 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 prompting the united states and 
other nations to send tens of thousands of troops and scores of 
warships to the gulf in a bid to force iraq to withdraw from 
kuwait the united nations also imposed a trade embargo on iraq and 
allowed other nations to use force to uphold it 
the speech said the united states and its allies are 
manipulating world opinion to conceal kuwaits identity as part of 
iraq until 1913 when britain undertook to sever kuwait from 
iraq 
it accused the united states and its western allies of pushing 
the world in the context of one of the most dangerous and 
pernicious campaigns of disinformation known to history into a new 
imperialistic era 
the united states is seeking in a dangerously coercive 
manner to impose its hegemony over the world aziz said

the mormon churchs 160th semiannual 
general conference this weekend finds the faith a study in familiar 
contrasts a robust and growing membership headed by an aged 
prophet in declining health 
the faiths tradition of succession by apostolic seniority has 
bred a gerontocracy that averages 708 years of age and produces 
presidents considerably older and more prone to infirmity 
i dont think anyone has to be told of the negatives of a 
gerontocracy in terms of the medical realities said d michael 
quinn a former brigham young university professor whos writing a 
history of the churchs hierarchy 
the other problem is that you have at the highest leadership 
of the church men who are at least two generations 
sometimes three generations removed from the majority of the 
population of the church 
but there are also advantages in having wellseasoned 
administrators in the governing first presidency and its advisory 
body the council of the twelve apostles he said 
the 160yearold church is struggling to cope with a rate of 
growth that has seen membership more than double every 15 years 
since 1945 
at that rate the church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
with 75 million members and more than 40000 fulltime 
missionaries will have 265 million members by 2080 according to a 
study by rodney stark a nonmormon professor of sociology and 
comparative religion at the university of washington the church 
has 42 million members in the united states 
what you have to realize is that a group can look small for a 
long time and then all of a sudden it just explodes stark said 
so just wait until all these people convert their relatives and 
see how it really kicks in 
the latest casualty of advancing years is ezra taft benson the 
churchs president since 1985 mormons believe jesus christ directs 
the churchs affairs through the president who is considered a 
prophet seer and revelator 
benson 91 remained hospitalized friday in serious condition 
two weeks after surgery for blood clots on the brain 
he was able to maintain a full schedule for only the first 
couple of years of his fiveyear tenure his predecessor spencer 
w kimball was mostly incapacitated for the five years before his 
death in 1985 at age 90 
but church spokesman don lefevre said the hierarchy doesnt miss 
a beat when its leader falters 
when the president of the church becomes incapacitated the 
network is already in place and his counselors and the council of 
the twelve apostles simply carry on lefevre said 
when a church president dies the office is filled by the 
president of the twelve that bodys most senior apostle howard w 
hunter a former corporate lawyer is bensons heir apparent 
hunter will be 83 nov 14 a widower he remarried last spring 
and puts in full days lefevre said 
church leaders in 1978 provided for retirement of members of the 
first quorum of the seventy which acts under the direction of the 
twelve giving some members emeritus status 
the move was seen as a way to inject new blood in the hierarchy 
but the policy has never been extended to include the twelve 
but eventually quinn said the mormon gerontocracy likely will 
face a crisis of succession where the heir to the prophetic mantle 
is himself unable not simply to walk unable to talk but unable 
to function in any recognizable way in front of an audience to even 
acknowledge he is the president of the church 
theyve been spared that thus far but if that occurs i dont 
know what theyll do he said

americas unemployment rate worsened for the 
third straight month in september the government said friday many 
analysts saw the report as evidence that the economy has quietly 
slipped into a recession 
the increase in the civilian jobless rate to 57 percent 
coupled with unemployment rises in july and august marked the 
first time since the depths of the 198182 recession that the 
jobless rate has increased three months in a row the government 
said 
lets face it its a trend weve been pushed over the edge 
were in a recession and its going to go on for at least six 
to nine months said david wyss an analyst for drimcgraw hill 
the bush administration insists the economy has not fallen into 
a recession but presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said after 
fridays announcement that were certainly concerned about the 
economy 
fitzwater said that concern was heightened by the house 
rejection of a proposed deficitreduction agreement which the 
administration had touted as the budgetary fix needed to convince 
the federal reserve board to lower interest rates and spur the 
flagging economy 
today we see unemployment jump to 57 percent which only 
emphasizes the urgency of this situation fitzwater said 
but many analysts said fridays report showing unemployment up 
01 percentage point and at its highest level since the spring of 
1988 made clear that the economy has lost the strength necessary 
to avoid toppling over the edge into a recession 
fallen off were in midair and i dont think weve reached 
the bottom yet said ian borsook a senior economist with merrill 
lynch 
more industries lost jobs than gained them in september causing 
an overall loss of 101000 jobs from nonfarm payrolls the labor 
departmet said 
about 42000 of those losses were census workers laid off by the 
government but janet norwood the commissioner labor statistics 
noted that the weakness in the september job market had hit 
factories and service industries as well 
few areas of the economy are escaping the downward tug of the 
current economic slowdown mrs norwood said 
the nations employment picture began a downward spiral in july 
as the economy failed to produce enough jobs to keep up with the 
number of americans looking for work since then the jobless rate 
has risen 05 percentage point from junes 52 percent 
the rapid jump in unemployment reflects an economy that was 
showing little signs of life even before iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait sent oil prices soaring and increased fears of an imminent 
downturn 
the governments technical definition of a recession two 
quarters of economic decline as measured by the gross national 
product has not officially been met 
indeed the gnp for the years third quarter is expected to post 
a small gain even with septembers lackluster performance many 
analysts think a fullfledged downturn will take hold in the fourth 
quarter 
the 101000job loss in september though inflated by the census 
workers was the biggest job decline since the economy lost 104000 
jobs in june 1986 the government said a year ago the economy was 
creating nearly 200000 jobs a month 
the slump in the manufacturing sector continued in september 
with factory jobs posting a 66000job loss there have been more 
than 500000 jobs lost in that sector since january 1989 
construction also continued its slide in september posting the 
fourth decline in as many months as the weakness in the housing 
market showed no signs of abating jobs in that sector have fallen 
by more than 100000 in recent months 
the serviceproducing sector which until a few months ago had 
been enjoying robust job growth actually lost 17000 jobs in 
september 
within the sector the services industry itself which employs 
one in four nonfarm workers added only 20000 jobs one of the 
smallest gains since the 198182 recession mrs norwood said 
labor costs which are frequently blamed for worsening inflation 
problems rose a sharp 05 percent the average hourly worker made 
1013 an hour in september up from 973 in september 1989 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the september 
jobless rate was 56 percent up from 55 percent in august

iraq said today the united states and its allies have sent 
forces to the persian gulf region because they hope to gain control 
of the middle easts oil supplies and that their plan has brought 
the world to the brink of war 
in a speech prepared for delivery to the un general assembly 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz said the un security council 
was hypocritical when it penalized iraq for its invasion of kuwait 
while allowing israel to continue occupying arab lands seized in 
1967 and 1973 wars 
he proposed that all middle east problems palestine 
lebanon the gulf and others be considered on the same basis 
an iraqi envoy was to read the aziz speech to the general 
assembly this evening a text of the speech was obtained in advance 
by the associated press 
aziz did not come to new york to deliver the speech because the 
united states denied landing rights for the plane the iraqi 
delegation has used in the past proposing instead that aziz take a 
commercial flight 
the foreign minister said in the speech that america and its 
allies are seeking to gain control over the oil reserves in the 
gulf so as to have a free hand in manipulating the needs of the 
world and especially the needs of the peoples of the third world 
for this important commodity 
he accused iraqs foes of deploying fleets aircraft and 
ground forces in the region in a way that has no parallel in 
contemporary history thus bringing the entire region nay the 
entire world to the brink of a devastating war 
also today the state department said 300 americans and 
foreignborn family members have signed up for an evacuation flight 
due to leave kuwait wednesday 
the passengers will arrive in north carolina on thursday after 
an overnight stay in london deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
the flight will go from baghdad to kuwait and then back to baghdad 
before flying on to london 
boucher declined to say how many of the 300 are americans 
the flight will be the first us governmentsponsored charter 
to evacuate americans and their family members since sept 22 
about 1900 americans have left the two countries aboard these 
flights since they were instituted a month ago the large majority 
have been women and children 
the state department said late last month that at least 900 us 
citizens remain trapped including 600 to 700 in kuwait and 300 to 
350 in iraq 
in other developments 
a respected western research institute says that if war breaks 
out in the persian gulf iraq could survive for only weeks 
a newspaper reported today that iraq has highexplosive devices 
equal in power to small nuclear bombs 
a soviet envoy carried a message from mikhail s gorbachev to 
iraq on thursday and britain said it supports linking talks on the 
palestinian question to an iraqi pullout from kuwait 
in london the director of the international institute for 
strategic studies francois heisbourg said on thursday that iraq 
would not last terribly long if war broke out several days or 
only a few weeks 
but at the same news conference institute spokesman andrew 
duncan said iraqi president saddam hussein would probably resort to 
using chemical weapons on western civilians because of problems 
attacking wellprotected and mobile us troops in the gulf 
meanwhile the los angeles times reported today that iraq has 
acquired explosives equal in power to small nuclear bombs and it 
said that has raised concerns that the united states has no ready 
defense against the weapons 
the fuelair explosives or faes have 10 times the power of 
conventional explosives and create a huge fireball and shock waves 
over a concentrated area without the radiation fallout associated 
with nuclear weapons 
military officials say the explosives could devastate oil 
fields air bases and troops the newspaper reported 
its not your gardenvariety weapon henry sokolski of the 
pentagons international security affairs office told the 
newspaper these are blasteffect weapons and what you cant see 
can kill you 
the weapons can be launched as bombs from airplanes or as 
warheads on missiles pentagon officials said us forces would 
have difficulty defending against a missiledelivered warhead but 
there is no clear evidence iraq has the ability to mount the 
explosives on missiles 
five senators have called on defense secretary dick cheney to 
launch an investigation into iraqs supply of the weapons which 
the paper said iraq apparently developed using scientific knowledge 
from the german arms industry 
meanwhile diplomatic efforts to end the 2monthold crisis 
moved forward yevgeny primakov a senior adviser to gorbachev 
arrived in baghdad thursday carrying an undisclosed message soviet 
diplomatic sources said 
tass the official soviet news agency quoted primakov as saying 
a negotiated solution was needed to avoid a military explosion 
he planned to request that some of 5000 soviet citizens most of 
them oil industry workers be allowed to leave iraq the diplomatic 
sources said 
also thursday foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain called 
on israel to be prepared to negotiate the palestinian problem if 
iraq withdraws from kuwait in a un speech monday president bush 
said an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait could lead to opportunities 
for a broad middle east settlement

prepared for the worst an energy 
department team equipped with millions of dollars worth of 
radiation monitors staked out kennedy space center for saturdays 
launch of a shuttle with a plutonium cargo 
it would be irresponsible not to be ready in the event of an 
accident said energy department spokesman dave jackson 
there is 237 pounds of plutonium in the space shuttle 
jackson said friday even if there is an accident and no release 
we have to document the fact that there is no release and make 
people understand there is no hazard 
about twothirds of the 70member team were to be standing by 
with portable radiation monitors during the fueling of discovery 
late friday and early saturday and during liftoff scheduled for 
saturday morning 
energy department officials also planned to have a plane 
circling overhead at launch time to measure radiation in the air in 
the event of a challengerlike accident 
the danger will linger for 7 hours after liftoff when the 
plutoniumpowered satellite is released for its fiveyear solar 
journey if one of the satellites upperstage engines fails for 
instance the spacecraft and its plutonium generator could come 
crashing through the atmosphere 
the emergency team is prepared to rush anywhere in the world 
that the generator might fall jackson said 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
say there is a less than one in 1 million chance of discovery being 
involved in an accident that would lead to a plutoniumrelated 
death so far there have been three space accidents involving 
plutonium generators during the 1960s and early 1970s 
about 20 antinuclear activists who say nasa is playing down the 
danger demonstrated at the space center friday morning 
they stood along a highway leading to the centers main offices 
holding signs condemning nasas use of plutonium as employees 
streamed by in cars on their way to work some of the workers 
shouted insults at the protesters 
two women one of them an 81yearold were arrested when they 
entered a restricted area with the intention of sitting on the 
launch pad they later were charged with trespassing 
armed security guards prevented reporters from approaching the 
protesters many of whom took part in a sept 22 demonstration that 
attracted about 150 people 
concerned about nasas recent spate of shuttle problems an 
environmental coalition asked a federal judge in washington to 
delay the launch for at least a year the judge refused to do so 
friday which came as no surprise to the protesters 
the same judge a year ago denied a similar request and 
atlantis lifted off with a jupiter probe containing twice as much 
plutonium as the sun probe ulysses that launch the first in which 
a shuttle carried plutonium drew a government radiationmonitoring 
team of about 200 people as well as many of the same protesters 
bruce gagnon the coalitions state coordinator said the 
demonstrations hopefully will persuade nasa to use solar panels 
instead of plutonium generators on deepspace probes scheduled to 
go up in the mid1990s 
all the excuses are gone now after this launch they have five 
to six years to develop a solar alternative gagnon said its 
important that people come out and protest against these things 
whether we stop it today or not 
neither gagnon nor any of the other protesters planned to be 
anywhere near kennedy space center on launch day

the guinness book of records first published to 
settle pub disputes and other friendly debates issued its 1991 
edition friday with 3000 new records revealing the lengths people 
will go to get their names in print 
englishman dale lyons ran 299 miles in four hours and 18 
minutes balancing a fresh egg in a dessert spoon in cracking the 
previous egg and spoon race record lyons gained a place in the 
book 
the royal army ordinance corps broke the round the world driving 
record between may 13 and june 22 traveling 251878 miles in 39 
days 23 hours and 35 minutes 
there is a fascination with breaking a record people like to 
feel they can actually get their name in a book said cathy 
brooks the spokeswoman for guinness publishing 
the latest edition shows that americans continue to pin their 
shot at the big time on big food 
students and staff at lawrence university in appleton wis 
froze out the competition in the largest popsicle category 
constructing one in february that weighed 7080 pounds 
proving that silliness knows no frontiers a crew of cooks at a 
pizza hut in singapore achieved its record by baking a pie 
measuring 111 feet 3 inches in diameter 
britains army catering corps of the prince of wales own 
regiment of yorkshire gave the world a recordbreaking yorkshire 
pudding of 360 square feet 
asians took the opposite approach achieving new world records 
for smallness 
dipak syal of yamuna nagar india won a record for minuscule 
writing by inscribing i love you and i love you too and 
thn signing his initials ds on a single grain of rice in 
may 
his 813 characters beat the record of pan xixing of wuxi china 
who in march wrote true friendship is like sound health the 
value of which is seldom known until it be lost on a human hair 
minuscule writing has proved very popular ms brooks said 
weve been receiving massive packages from india all year our 
editors open them up to find one grain of rice inside the biggest 
problem has been not losing the potential record breaker under a 
desk 
since the first guinness book of records was published in 
england in 1955 the fascination with setting records has spread as 
the book made its way around the world 
the first us edition published under the title guinness book 
of world records appeared in 1956 french and german language 
versions quickly followed 
the book has been translated into japanese spanish danish 
norwegian dutch portuguese czech hebrew serbocroatian 
icelandic slovenian greek indonesian chinese turkish hindi 
malay arabic thai tamil telugu malayalam kannada and

in 1990 the first russian language edition was published 
now that we have a publishing partner in the soviet union it 
is possible to check and verify information in a way which has been 
impossible in the past said donald mcfarlan editor of the 
guinness book of records 
the international competition the book has sparked could not 
have been envisioned by sir hugh beaver on nov 10 1951 the 
fateful day his hunting party missed a flock of golden plover 
seeking a reason for the failure beaver searched a reference 
book for proof that the golden plover was britains fastest game 
bird 
it isnt the 1991 guinness book of records lists the red grouse 
as britains fastest bird 
finding no definitive reference book set beaver to thinking the 
managing director of guinness the beer brewer pictured unanswered 
questions arising in debates in pubs throughout britain 
the guinness book of records was born in 1974 it earned its 
own place in the record books as the topselling copyright book in

a judge gave the thumbs up friday 
and nasa counted down toward a launch of the space shuttle 
discovery carrying the nuclearpowered ulysses spacecraft 
two demonstrators opposed to discoverys radioactive cargo were 
arrested 
discovery was scheduled to blast off at 735 am saturday six 
hours after launch the fiveman crew is supposed to release 
ulysses from the cargo hold 
the satellite will then rocket itself out of earth orbit for a 
roundabout voyage that eventually will take it around the sun to 
study its sofar unexplored polar regions 
nasa officials said friday the countdown was going well fueling 
of the shuttle which includes a critical test of its liquid 
hydrogen plumbing was scheduled to begin about 1115 pm edt 
kennedy space center spokesman dick young said the mission would 
be unaffected in the event of a shutdown of government agencies 
because of the dispute over the federal budget he said funds for 
the mission had already been set aside and notices had gone out 
that all employees were to report to work 
the mood of the team is confident and thats despite 
distractions and disappointments recently said launch director 
robert b sieck if the weather is good to us well have some 
good news on saturday 
for nasa the news has been mostly bad since the last successful 
shuttle launch in april the agency has scrubbed four shuttle 
launch attempts because of hydrogen fuel leaks and learned that 
there is a serious flaw in the hubble space telescope 
another problem was added to the list thursday when workers 
discovered that a 9foot 70pound metal beam had been left in the 
engine compartment of the shuttle atlantis 
when the craft was hoisted from a horizontal to a vertical 
position the beam clanked around inside the compartment causing 
up to 25 dents and dings none of the damage was believed serious 
sieck said and atlantis is still scheduled for a mission in 
november 
the beam is normally used to support a work platform used when 
the shuttle is being processed on the ground 
william lenoir boss of nasas spaceflight program said the 
problems are isolated incidents and not signs of the agencys 
decline 
i dont see a common thread that connects the hubble incident 
the hydrogen leaks and the beam lenoir said at a news 
conference 
a group of 20 demonstrators gathered at a restricted entrance to 
the space center friday morning and protested ulysses nuclear 
power supply they milled around the gate waving signs and calling 
to space center employees driving in to work 
two women from the group were taken into custody after they 
walked past a checkpoint into a restricted area they were charged 
with trespassing 
in washington dc a judge rejected a petition by three 
activist groups that sought to block discoverys launch with its 
nuclearpowered payload they asked for more research into the 
risks of the spread of radioactive materials should discovery 
explode during launch 
us district judge oliver gasch rejected the contention just 
as he did for a similar claim filed last year before the launch of 
galileo which also was nuclear powered 
ulysses is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator 
or rtg which generates electricity from the heat of 237 pounds of 
highly radioactive plutonium the united states has used 22 rtgs on 
earlier space missions including five moon flights 
nasa says the plutonium is housed in a module that has been 
tested to withstand any probable accident the agency estimated 
that in the worst possible accident there is only a 1in44 
million chance of 145 cancer fatalities over 50 years 
after ulysses is released from discovery a twostage rocket 
will fire and send the europeanbuilt craft streaking toward 
jupiter ulysses will loop over jupiters north pole in 1992 and 
the giant planets intense gravity will give it a powerful burst of 
speed and hurl it back toward the suns south pole 
in 1994 ulysses will pass within 120 million miles of the suns 
south pole and about 18 months later it will pass over the solar 
north pole 
discoverys commander is richard n richards the pilot will be 
robert d cabana others in the crew are william m shepherd bruce 
melnick and thomas d akers

the yanomami indians the largest 
known primitive tribe in existence may be changing from a nomadic 
to a stable community two leading scientists said friday 
some groups in the tribe which inhabits the tropical amazon 
rain forest along venezuelas border with brazil are also 
experiencing a population growth equal to about 2 percent a year 
they said 
charles brewercarias a venezuelan naturalist said the 
population growth coupled with a change in cultivation habits were 
basic conditions for transition to a stable community 
brewercarias and napoleon a chagnon an anthropology professor 
at the university of california at santa barbara led a 40day 
expedition that in recent weeks contacted four yanomami groups 
about 14000 yanomamis inhabit the venezuelan amazon and 9000 
live across the border in the brazilian rainforest scientists say 
it is believed the yanomamis migrated from the caribbean region 
thousands of years ago because they burn their dead and drink a 
solution of the ashes evidence of them is hard to trace 
the yanomamis hunt with poisoned arrows and many use primitive 
tools they shun clothes decorate their bodies with fruit dye and 
flowers and live under huge palm huts in small communities 
the yanomami are the largest tribe with little or no contact 
with the modern world 
the yanomami groups are based on parental ties but once they 
reach a number of 200 to 250 parental relationship weakens among 
yanomami and they apparently split forming a new group that settles 
elsewhere scientists say 
chagnon who has studied the yanomami indians for 25 years said 
his conclusions on population growth among the venezuelan groups 
come from studies on the reproduction of yanomami women from 
different villages 
on the brazilian side of the border the yanomamis havent been 
as lucky suffering at the hands of gold prospectors who have 
brought disease and chemicals to the primitive communities 
speaking from california chagnon said he also has collected 
data on settlement and migration he said most existing yanomami 
villages emerged from a single village between 120 and 150 years 
ago and then scattered 
the original village had a population of no more than 300 their 
descendents dispersed over 12 villages and now number over 2000 
they increased more than sixfold during the past 120150 
years by demographic standards that is a very high rate of 
expansion it would be a high rate even if it were half of this 
he said 
chagnon and brewercarias are codirecting a project to study 
the yanomami and other indian cultures over the next 10 years 
the recent expedition which covered the high siapa river basin 
near the brazilian border was supported by the university of 
california and fundafaci a private venezuelan foundation 
brewercarias said the expedition found evidence that new 
splinter groups were spreading over the brazilianvenezuelan 
border some have shifted cultivations from banana to manioc 
it seems they are experimenting with new staples 
brewercarias said 
it took nine hours of helicopter flight before the expedition 
found and contacted the first yanomami group still untouched and 
up to that moment totally isolated from our culture 
brewercarias said 
in brazil the yanomamis have been pushed deep into the jungle by 
gold prospectors who have invaded their lands seeking gold and 
diamonds about 3000 have died over the past three years most 
from exposure to disease 
because of their isolation the indians have no immunity against 
common viruses and can easily die from flu or cold

princess diana visited two first ladies friday 
one who lives in the white house and another only three years 
old who is infected with the aids virus 
the younger first lady earned her nickname because she was 
the first child placed at grandmas house a home for children with 
the deadly virus 
the little girl dressed in bright pink overalls for the 
occasion grabbed dianas hand when they were introduced the 
princess scooped her up carried her upstairs during a tour of the 
victorian row house and readily agreed when she asked to ride 
around the block in dianas dark green rolls royce 
as cameras flashed and whirred the princess stepped out of the 
car with the first lady in her arms a symbolic picture that 
gratified the founders of grandmas house who have kept its 
location unpublicized out of concern about prejudice and fear 
that kind of picture a person of her stature coming 
said the rev debbie tate president of a crisis housing 
organization that runs grandmas house it shows that its all 
right to love a person with aids its all right to care about a 
person with aids its all right to hug a person with aids it 
wont hurt you 
tate said the little girl had not been diagnosed yet with 
fullfledged aids but the virus was progressing once that 
diagnosis is made she said through tears the first lady could 
be expected to live about a year 
dianas whirlwind trip her second solo visit to the united 
states ended less than 24 hours after she arrived in the country 
she attended a gala thursday night to benefit grandmas house 
and ballet companien washington and london and had coffee 
friday morning at the white house with barbara bush and others 
before her motorcade went to the childrens residence 
president bush appeared for the last 10 or 15 minutes of the 
35minute white house meeting according to british embassy 
spokesman francis cornish he said bush congratulated diana on her 
work and compared her causes to those he honors with his thousand 
points of light program 
diana wearing a dusty pink suit with purple trim and matching 
purple pumps knelt down on the floor of the grandmas house 
playroom to get closer to the children there 
arent you excited we have the princess with us today a

the wife of republican congressional 
candidate dick waterfield says her motivation for tearing down 
campaign posters belonging to her husbands opponent was safety 
not politics 
gail waterfield was spotted by hartley county sheriff johnny 
williams thursday morning in a waterfield for congress campaign car 
tearing a poster for bill sarpalius poster from a utility pole 
when asked what she was doing mrs waterfield told williams she 
was pulling the posters because they were posted illegally on 
telephone poles the amarillo globenews reported 
sarpalius a democrat is the incumbent and he faces waterfield 
in the november election 
waterfield spokesman david crowder brushed aside as 
ridiculous assertions that the removal of the sarpalius 
election posters was politically motivated mrs waterfield took 
down the signs he said for safety reasons 
signs placed on utility poles are illegal regardless of 
whether theyre campaign or otherwise signs on utility poles pose 
problems for the individuals that service utility poles crowder 
said 
sarpalius spokesman robert hinkle who speculated the signs were 
posted by supporters said he was stunned to learn it was 
waterfields wife removing their signs 
gail may be more anxious about going to washington than dick 
is hinkle said if you believe she was ripping them down 
because it was unsafe ive got some property to sell you 
james hoard spokesman for southwestern public service co said 
late thursday that posting signs on power poles is illegal in most 
cities but he wasnt sure what the law was in the outlying areas

germanys new parliament on friday ratified 
an international treaty that grants full sovereignty to the nation 
formally ending 45 years of special rights by the world war ii 
allies 
parliament also rescued plans for nationwide elections dec 2 by 
approving a new balloting law the first time former east german 
lawmakers cast parliamentary votes alongside colleagues from the 
west 
some eastern newcomers seemed moved by the occasion which came 
two days after east germany and west germany became one 
im awed that i from mecklenburg am permitted to speak to 
an allgerman parliament said conradmichael lehment a resident 
of that former east german city and a member of the free democrats 
the 144 eastern lawmakers joining 519 representatives from the 
west crowded into the bundestag a humble structure that once 
housed part of bonns water system 
i warmly welcome you to the waterworks parliamentary 
president rita suessmuth joked to the new lawmakers 
on thursday the first allgerman parliament since 1933 held a 
symbolic session in berlin capital of the new nation bonn is 
germanys seat of parliament 
the new 663member parliaments approval formally ends special 
rights conferred on the united states the soviet union france and 
britain after the allies defeated and divided nazi germany in world 
war ii 
under the rights the allied powers controlled transit between 
sectors of berlin and could veto any laws in the city they also 
prohibited the west german carrier lufthansa from flying to berlin 
because its planes would have had to fly over what was then east 
germany 
the treaty was already signed in moscow on sept 12 by west and 
east germany and the four allies 
a broad majority of government and opposition lawmakers approved 
the new election law by a simple show of hands the legislation 
replaces an election treaty that was rejected by the supreme court 
on sept 29 the court said the old treaty gave unfair treatement 
to small parties 
the overruled treaty would have required a party to win 5 
percent of the vote across germany to earn a seat in the bundestag 
the new law in effect sets up two separate election areas in the 
united germany lawmakers in former east germany will have to 
receive 5 percent on their own turf rather than polling that 
amount across the united country 
that will give smaller partes like the party for democratic 
socialism east germanys renamed communists a better chance of 
winning parliamentary seats 
however the democratic socialists voted against the new plan 
saying it opposes any minimum vote for winning parliamentary seats 
such a system said party leader gregor gysi manipulates the 
will of the voters 
parliamentarians needed to quickly come to agreement on an 
election law so the vote could be held as scheduled dec 2 
the united parliaments first working session was relatively 
civil but accusations flew nonetheless 
ingrid matthaeusmaier from the west german branch of the 
opposition social democrats charged that chancellor helmut kohls 
unity policies had created concern fears and discontent among 
east germans 
despair is rising on former east german territory because of 
rising unemployment resulting from the rough transition from four 
decades of communism into capitalism 
finance minister theo waigel presented a new supplementary 
budget to the lawmakers that would raise federal borrowing this 
year by 17 billion 
most of the borrowed money would be used to create new jobs and 
housing and to bolster pensions and social welfare payments in the 
eastern part of germany 
also during the parliamentary session former communists and 
other leftists joined with the social democrats in calling for 
further disarmament in united germany 
horst ehmke a security expert for the social democrats said 
all nuclear weapons should be removed from germany 
sylviayvonne kaufmann from the party for democratic socialism 
said germany should scrap compulsory military service

lawmakers from nowextinguished east 
germany were in town friday dismayed by bonns steep hotel prices 
and eager to move into offices hastily being furnished 
some offices for legislators from the former communist party 
were ready in what was once a kindergarten located near the 
parliament building lawmakers from other parties were also moving 
into new rooms 
but they were shocked at prices in bonn the parliamentary seat 
of united germany asked how he found his hotel wolfgang thierse 
of the social democratic party saidvery expensive i have never 
before in my life slept for 215 marks 140 a night 
youre not there long enough to get your moneys worth 
thierse said 
at the offices of the former communist party now called the 
party of democratic socialism lawmaker sabine fache was busy 
setting up her office after attending fridays parliament session 
we had a good flight from berlin it was a lufthansa flight 
late last night that was a first ms fache said laughing 
the four world war ii allies prohibited lufthansa the national 
airline from flying between west germany and berlin because its 
planes would have had to fly over east german territory that 
changed with german unity 
missing in bonn from the 23 democratic socialist deputies was 
former east german prime minister hans modrow on a visit to japan 
virtually all of the other 144 parliament members from the east 
made the trip west to bonn 
after being driven past parliament buildings the newcomers were 
split among several hotels in the city ms fache said 
ours was a little hotel on the outskirts we werent too happy 
because there was no restaurant open we ended up going to a little 
pizza place about 11 pm ms fache said 
bonn a sleepy city along the rhine is notorious for closing 
down early unlike the bustling metropolis of berlin 
but social democratic party delegates said they had expected 
more distance from some of bonns deputies ms fache said 
but it wasnt like that they gave us tips on what to do they 
were friendly we were surprised maybe they still see us as 
exotic she said 
ms fache is a social democratic party candidate for the dec 2 
elections from altenburg 150 miles south of berlin 
new parliamentarians from other parties many of whom arrived on 
the same lufthansa flight were also scattered among various bonn 
hotels 
most were eager to get down to business 
i really cant talk about my feelings said former east 
german prime minister lothar de maiziere and now a member of the 
bonn cabinet i just want to get down to work 
and he meant it the softspoken politician was the first 
member to arrive for friday mornings cabinet meeting

president bush on friday proposed legislation 
to give a decade of preferable trade benefits to peru colombia 
ecuador and bolivia in thanks for their cooperation in the war 
against drugs 
the andean trade preference act is patterned after the caribbean 
basin initiative that gives special trade benefits to caribbean 
nations 
the andean proposal bush sent to congress also addresses the 
long festering trade dispute with colombia over cut flowers by 
making them duty free 
it would authorize duty free treatment for 10 years for some 
imports from the countries along the andean mountains which also 
are the principle source and production countries for the cocaine 
trade 
products particularly sensitive to import competition will 
not be duty free the white house said those products include 
textiles and apparel canned tuna petroleum products watches and 
watch parts luggage leather apparel and flat goods will still be 
dutiable but under a duty reduction program 
the administration is trying to provide economic incentives and 
assistance to south american countries that have suffered in 
cracking down on lucrative drug industries that greatly buttress 
their poor economies 
the idea behind this legislation is to give the countries an 
extra boost by providing a special 10year access to the 
american market bush said as he signed the transmittal to 
congress 
the trade measure is a follow up to the drug summit meeting bush 
held with the presidents of peru bolivia and colombia in 
cartagena colombia he promised to work on expanding economic 
opportunities for countries that cooperate with us efforts to 
interdict drugs and halt production of illicit narcotics 
enactment of the measure bush said in a letter to congress 
will permit the united states to support the efforts of the 
andean countries to eliminate the production processing and 
shipment of illicit drugs 
bush had promised colombias president cesar gaviria when they 
met at the united nations on saturday that he would seek special 
trade benefits for colombia including removal of tariffs on 
flowers the countrys second biggest export after coffee 
colombia exports 80 percent of its flower crop to the united 
states 
the administration responding to complaints from american 
growers had accused colombia of dumping cut flowers in this 
country at unreasonably low prices and had sharply increased 
tariffs on colombian flowers

sentenced friday to a minimum 120 years in prison for helping to 
kill four members of a family crimes he blamed on his father 
damon lundgren 19 stood with folded hands and appeared calm as 
lake county common pleas judge paul h mitrovich sentenced him for 
his role in the deaths of dennis avery and averys three daughters 
he was acquitted in the death of averys wife cheryl 
the averys belonged to the religious cult headed by damons 
father jeffrey lundgren the averys were led one by one into a 
barn on april 17 1989 bound and gagged with duct tape then shot 
and dumped in a common grave 
damon lundgren received consecutive sentences of 20 years to 
life for each of four counts of aggravated murder and consecutive 
sentences of 10 to 25 years on each of four counts of kidnapping 
he would not be eligible for parole for at least 80 years 
defense lawyers said they would seek a new trial 
mitrovich chastised damon lundgren for not accepting 
responsibility 
you accept no blame you blame your father you claim this was 
your fathers doing and none of your own the judge said 
jeffrey lundgren could not have done anything without the help 
and devotion of you and his other followers society cannot 
tolerate such excuses he said 
the teenager was the last of his family sentenced in the case 
his father received a death sentence his mother alice lundgren 
was sentenced to five life terms for conspiracy complicity and 
kidnapping 
friends of damon lundgrens sat in the court gallery and wept as 
he was sentenced tey had offered a petition bearing 514 
signatures of people asking that he receive the minimum sentence of 
life with chance of parole after 20 years 
i know the kind of person he is said former classmate jim 
ford 19 
i know the kind of person his dad is and i feel his dad had 
everything to do with the cult and the killings ford said and 
he was a very overpowering person and damon was the type of person 
who could be pulled into someone who could lead him around 
the averys were killed at a farm the cult rented at kirtland 
about 30 miles east of cleveland authorities found the bodies jan 
4 
thirteen cult members were subsequently arrested some have 
pleaded guilty to reduced charges 
jeffrey lundgren 40 was defrocked as a lay minister of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints before 
forming his cult 
he said he considered himself a prophet of god and received 
instructions to kill the aveys through interpretation of 
scriptures 
defense lawyers argued that damon lundgren was so strictly 
raised and controlled by his father that he was unable to disobey 
orders to help wrestle dennis avery to the ground and help bind and 
gag him

fear of a voter revolt outweighed fear of 
president bush or house leaders when lawmakers defeated the 500 
billion budget package 
it was the combination of tax increases and spending cuts 
coming one month before an election that doomed the plan said 
rep edward madigan rill no amount of economic theory or 
reasoning or leadership pressure could overcome that he said 
the point is we cant get whipped into line added rep 
mickey edwards rokla the public really spoke out on this 
bush trying to emulate the success of president reagan tried 
to boost the package by going on national television tuesday night 
and asking voters to call their congressmen 
they did 8 to 1 against the deal in edwards office other 
lawmakers reported similar results 
and in the days leading up to the vote the white house tacitly 
admitted that a vote for the plan was politically stupid 
house members running for the senate or for governor were immune 
from the lobbying all of us statewide candidates got a bye 
said rep john rowland rct who is running for governor 
all eight gop house members running for the senate voted against 
the president and are bragging about it back home likewise the 
democrat and two republicans running for governor opposed the 
measure 
of 33 members of both parties running in tight reelection 
races only two voted for the package in at least one case an 
endangered gop incumbent offered his leaders his vote and they told 
him to vote no 
for the bulk of the house bushs pleas for the good of the 
economy longterm gain and lower interest rates paled against the 
calls of voters staring at gas tax increases and higher medicare 
bills 
the voters won hands down 
the president wasnt the only one who demonstrated a lack of 
clout 
bush enlisted former presidents reagan ford and nixon in his 
lobbying campaign and republican national chairman lee atwater 
ill with cancer sent a letter 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash usually can count at 
least on the massachusetts democrats to support a party position 
but that state is practically defining voter antiincumbent 
feelings these days and all but one of the ten voted against him 
house minority leader bob michel rill persuaded only three 
of the other seven illinois republicans to go along 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif couldnt 
even squeeze a vote out of his three housemates reps charles 
schumer dny marty russo dill and george miller dcalif 
of the congressional leadership only senate minority leader bob 
dole rkan seemed to carry any weight with dole strongly behind 
it the entire kansas delegation voted for the plan despite its 13 
billion cut in agriculture spending

five senators friday called for a pentagon 
investigation of how iraq might have obtained the technology to 
make fuelair explosives for extremely powerful bombs that can 
spread their blast over a wide area 
the senators are concerned that a german company 
messerschmittboelkowblohm may have given away the formulas 
needed to make the explosives 
these weapons used by us forces in vietnam atomize liquid 
fuel like propane into a widely spread fine mist and then ignite 
it they are highly effective against troops in the open but not 
very useful against hardened targets like fortifications 
one expert jann nolan of the brookings institution called them 
highly overrated 
it is vita that an immediate and full investigation be made 
of what technology was transferred to iraq and by whom stated 
the letter to defense secretary richard cheney from sens jesse 
helms rnc alan dixon dill connie mack rfla john heinz 
rpa and john glenn dohio 
the senators said that the german concern a subsidiary of 
mercedesbenz and the countrys largest aerospace firm could have 
transferred the bomb technology while working on the 
egyptianiraqiargentine condor 2 ballistic missile program in the 
mid1980s 
the pentagon sought to play down any fears over the weapon 
itself and said it had no evidence that iraqi fuelair explosives 
had come from a us technology leak through messerschmitt or any 
other company or country 
the united states the soviet union china france west 
germany spain and israel all have the weapons a defense 
department spokesman said this is old technology its not 
unique or advanced 
helms has been a persistent critic of western defense 
contractors particularly those in germany who have allegedly sold 
weapons to potential adversaries of the united states 
a congressional source said that iraq is able to use the weapons 
either as bombs dropped from an airplane or as warheads on 
missiles the missile threat is seen as the greater menace to us 
and allied troops in saudi arabia because allied defenses against 
aircraft are excellent the source said 
this source spoke on condition that he not be identified 
henry sokolski an assistant secretary of defense for 
international security affairs told the los angeles times that 
officials are concerned because a fuelair bomb or warhead is not 
your gardenvariety weapon these are blasteffect weapons and 
what you cant see can kill you 
a pentagon official said friday that sokolski is not taking 
press calls

some high schools canceled friday night 
football games because encephalitis spread by nightflying 
mosquitos has been confirmed in 12 florida counties and a growing 
number of people are presumed to have the virus 
health officials urged floridians to wear protective longsleeve 
clothing and load up on bug repellent when they are outdoors at 
night 
weary mosquito control fighters in hillsborough county alone 
logged 250 calls in one day from frightened homeowners wanting them 
to spray or identify bugs and from northerners concerned about 
coming to florida 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services 
confirmed 28 cases of the st louis strain of encephalitis and 
listed 10 more as presumed cases as of midday friday all in 
central and southern florida 
where it goes from here is anybodys guess said ernie 
durfee hrs spokesman 
encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain that causes fever 
sore throat headaches confusion and muscular weakness in severe 
cases of this incurable disease it causes convulsions coma and 
death the st louis strain of the disease is named for the city 
where it was discovered in 1933 
many people who get infected may not have a disease they can 
recognize as being caused by that virus dr thomas hoffman of 
the university of miami medical school said the most important 
thing is precaution precaution against insect bites 
hardest hit since the first case was discovered in august has 
been the states central atlantic coast indian river has 10 cases 
and three more presumed cases and orange county home to the 
states biggest tourist attractions has three confirmed and 
another person presumed to have it 
fifteen people are hospitalized and two both over age 55 are 
comatose health officials said 
we watched the epidemic unfold in front of us right from the 
beginning until today and we feel that possibly the worst part of 
the epidemic may still be ahead said jonathan day an 
entomologist with the university of floridas institute of food and 
agricultural sciences 
the season for transmission of the virus typically runs until 
middecember as mosquitoes continue to breed and bite the disease 
can be expected to spread with them day said 
if we get a cold snap it will kill them its all up to mother 
nature durfee said 
very few mosquitoes actually are carriers said durfee 
he said the disease is cyclical occurring every 10 to 15 years 
because of a combination of factors such as rainfall and mosquito 
hatchings 
the st louis strain last surfaced in florida 13 years ago with

the army took over the headquarters 
of slovenias regional defense forces friday raising speculation 
the government was reasserting its authority in the rebellious 
northern republic 
the army seizure led to protests by about 200 people who 
gathered outside the building slovenian policemen also rushed to 
surround the headquarters and other buildings in the capital 
apparently to prevent further army movements 
the army meanwhile sought to play down the takeover saying in 
a statement broadcast on state radio that the military had not 
occupied the headquarters but were only securing the building in 
accordance with regulations 
there was no violence and there are no dangers for anyone 
jelko kacin slovenias deputy defense minister said in a 
telephone interview state radio reported the protesters dispersed 
peacefully 
on thursday slovenias parliament proposed a plebiscite on 
independence from yugoslavia and declared 30 federal laws 
incompatible with the republics newly drafted constitution 
slovenias moves for independence and recent clashes between 
yugoslavias two biggest ethnic groups the serbians and croatians 
have strained the unity of the 72yearold nation 
slovenia is one of six republics that form yugoslavia serbia is 
the largest republic and croatia is secondlargest 
according to slovenian radio 16 military police officers drove 
up to slovenias home guard building in downtown ljubljana during 
the night and took over the headquarters peacefully it said 30 
civilian employees were permitted to leave the building 
slovenias government which advocates turning yugoslavia into a 
loose confederation of sovereign states issued a statement 
protesting the action and called it a provocation aimed at 
inciting conflicts 
but the slovenian authorities also said the headquarters 
building which belongs to the federal government had been 
evacuated by the territorial defense forces on thursday 
last week the slovenian defense forces took over the local 
militia sacking an army general and replacing a dozen other 
territorial army officers loyal to belgrade 
yugoslavia on tuesday ordered the army to reassert control over 
the reservist defense force home guard forces were formed from 
local inhabitants in all six yugoslav republics in the late 1960s 
one western diplomat in belgrade described the army action 
friday as symbolic 
now the army can say they fulfilled the order to take 
control of the territorial defense and the slovenes can say they 
still command their own home guard said a western diplomat in 
belgrade who spoke on condition of anonymity

a jury on friday acquitted an art gallery and 
its director of obscenity charges for exhibiting sexually graphic 
photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe 
dennis barrie director of the contemporary arts center smiled 
as the verdict was read spectators in the courtroom shouted and 
applauded and barrie hugged his lawyers 
in the nations first obscenity trial of an art institution the 
gallery and barrie were acquitted of misdemeanor charges of 
pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material 
barrie could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined 
2000 and the gallery fined 10000 if convicted of both counts 
in closing arguments the prosecutor said the sexually graphic 
photographs were convincing evidence in themselves for a 
conviction 
but a lawyer for the contemporary arts center said the state 
failed to show the exhibit lacked artistic merit 
the misdemeanor charges stemmed from the exhibit robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment which appeared in cincinnati 
for seven weeks last spring 
frank prouty an assistant city prosecutor said in his closing 
argument that five photos depicting graphic sex acts involving men 
and two that showed children with their genitals exposed were 
enough for convictions the charges were based on those seven 
pictures in the 175photo exhibit 
the pictures speak for themselves prouty told the jury in 
hamilton county municipal court the pictures are the issue 
marc mezibov the gallerys lawyer said the state failed to 
prove its case against the center and barrie no presentation was 
made to back up the assertion that the photographs werent 
legitimate art 
have you thought why it is that no one for the state of ohio 
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic 
value dont you think that if there were people out there who 
thought that the state of ohio would have found them mezibov 
said 
barries attorney h louis sirkin reminded jurors that the 
same exhibit was shown hn philadelphia chicago and berkeley 
calif without incident 
is cincinnati that different are we that childish are we not 
big enough to say we cant accept what other cities have seen 
sirkin asked 
judge david albanese instructed the jury shortly after noon 
on thursday defense lawyers challenged the credentials of the 
prosecutions only expert witness judith reisman on grounds that 
she was unqualified but albanese ruled she could testify 
ms reisman said her qualifications included having prepared 
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the smithsonian 
institution 
she also worked as a consultant for televisions captain 
kangaroo show for former attorney general edwin meeses 
commission on pornography and for the conservative american family 
association 
at issue in the trial were seven photographs a grand jury cited 
from the 175photo exhibit 
ms reisman testified that photographing nude children can be a 
prelude to sexual abuse 
we are putting at risk additional children because many people 
see themselves as photographers and many people do use the 
technique of telling children this is appropriate because this is 
in a museum this is appropriate because it is in a book she 
said 
that happens to be a standard technique for getting children 
into a child sexabuse situation 
defense experts have testified that mapplethorpe who died last 
year of aids at age 42 was an accomplished and respected 
photographer and that photographs of the children were morally and 
sexually innocent 
the exhibit drew more than 80000 people during its sevenweek 
run an attendance record for an art exhibit in cincinnati it 
closes this week in boston where 103000 tickets have been sold

israel reacted angrily on friday to disclosures 
by egyptian president hosni mubarak of secret iraqi contacts with 
the jewish state 
however one official acknowledged informal contacts with iraq 
during the 19801988 persian gulf war and a source said exchanges 
continued through intermediaries during the current crisis 
mubaraks statements followed several press reports saying 
iraqiisraeli contacts occurred in recent weeks but his highly 
public statments were the first to draw israels ire 
eliyahu benelissar chariman of the israeli parliaments 
defense and foreign affairs committee on friday accused mubarak of 
psychological warfare and said his comment was aimed at 
undercutting iraq not israel 
he mubarak wants to shame iraq in the arab world 
benelissar told israels army radio 
he added why in the world is he involving us at a time when 
we are trying so hard by the by at the request of the egyptians 
the americans and others not to get involved 
despite repeated iraqi threats to attack israel in the current 
crisis israel has maintained a low profile to avoid undermining 
us efforts to mobilize moderate arab countries to counter iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
mubarak made a speech thursday marking the 17th anniversary of 
egypts last war with israel in it he said iraq and israel have 
had indirect contacts for years and cited secret exchanges in 1987 
and 1989 through a harvard university professor 
mubarak said he was disclosing the exchanges in reply to iraqi 
allegations that egypt was subserviant to the israeli and us 
intelligence services 
he also implied that egypt had access to israels intelligence 
data under their 1979 peace treaty israel radio quoted unnamed 
army officials as expressing shock at this statement and 
denying there is any exchange of intelligence with egypt 
the foreign and defense ministries declined to comment on 
mubaraks statements avi pazner an aide to prime minister yitzhak 
shamir said in response to a smiliar report earlier this week he 
was unaware of any israeliiraqi contacts during the gulf crisis 
the first report on such contacts was late last monthin the 
londonbased economists foreign report it said iraq in recent 
weeks has been sending messages to israel via jordans king 
hussein 
iraq offered not to attack israel if israel would agree not to 
attack iraq in the event of a war in the gulf the foreign report 
said israel replied again through king hussein that it had no 
plan to attack iraq or to be involved in the gulf crisis 
staterun jordan radio carried a different version saying 
saddam had sent a message to israel via zambian president kenneth 
kaunda 
the foreign report said the contacts included meetings between 
israeli officials and iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz and his 
deputy nizar hamdoon it said at least two proposed meetings with 
an israeli cabinet minister fell through 
a former israeli government adviser on arab affairs acknowledged 
that during the gulf war in a great variety of ways israel and 
iraq were delivering messages to each other 
the adviser who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity said the contacts were through intermediaries and were 
continuing 
since saddams threat to burn half of israel such messages 
have been going back and forth a number of times to prevent any 
misunderstanding he said

democratic national chairman ron brown 
said friday hes disappointed the calimaries and it hasnt had much influence 
on the 
nomination recently 
iowas firstinthenation presidential caucuses are held in 
early february 
i think its ridiculous for the most populous state in the 
country to play virtually no role in the nomination of candidates 
of either party brown told a news conference 
he said the california legislature still has time to act any 
move to settle the partys nomination earlier would serve the 
partys interest he said 
brown said that as party chairman i have a responsibility to 
push the party toward unifying behind a nominee as early in the 
process as possible so we can start running against george bush 
rather than against each other 
the more states that move earlier in the process the better i 
like it he told a news conference 
despite that brown said theres no move to replace iowa as the 
initial test 
i wish other states would move up because that gives us a 
chance of getting a consensus candidate who can run against and 
beat george bush he said none of that threatens iowas 
firstinthenation caucus status 
every four years the state gets heavy attention as candidates 
stump throughout iowa the political parties like the caucuses 
because the presidential candidates running in the state give them 
major organizational and financial help 
but theres a quadrennial effort to shuffle the primary lineup 
because officials in many other states argue that the caucuses give 
far too much influence to a tiny and unrepresentative state 
in addition the complex party rules and long string of 
primaries virtually assures that democrats wont have a nominee 
until very late in the process while republicans settle their 
primaries earlier

more than 1000 people angered by police 
corruption took to the streets friday night burning barricades and 
pelting riot troopers with firebombs and rocks in a crimeridden 
neighborhood 
at least 106 people including 83 police have been injured in 
the violence that began tuesday in the nishinari district of osaka 
japans no 2 city more than 40 people have been arrested 
the scope of the violence is extremely unusual for japan where 
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree 
the rundown neighborhood is known for its gangs transient 
laborers and shabby hotels locals say there long have been bad 
feelings between the areas poor residents and police 
dogs of gangsters come out kneel down before us and 
apologize a man screamed through a loudspeaker to police 
dont you know how much hardship our daily laborers are going 
through why dont you try working at a construction site one day 
and you will probably realize how much we are abused by this 
society 
by 1 am saturday a crowd estimated earlier at more than 1000 
laborers from the district and outside youths had dwindled to about 
600 police said but many laborers had dispersed and those 
remaining were largely high schoolage youths some of whom 
appeared to be enjoying themselves 
one was an 11yearold boy who said he was just here to be on 
television 
a man who refused to identify himself said he had come from 
kyoto 30 miles away because i thought this may be a once in a 
lifetime chance for me throw stones at police and get away with 
it 
most of the crowd had filtered away by 3 am saturday leaving 
behind a street littered with broken glass rocks and burned 
debris a cordon of about 20 armed troopers continued to guard the 
police station 
earlier about 2500 police carrying large metal shields were in 
position along main roads in nishinari and in front of the district 
police station friday night four vehicles equipped with water 
cannons guarded the stations main entrance 
police used the water cannons repeatedly to douse the more than 
1000 people confronting them the crowd which included day 
laborers from the district and young people from outside it 
scattered each time but then regrouped 
large piles of burned vehicles and bicycles formed barricades 
and blocked traffic protesters threw firebombs and rocks 
we are now starting to arrest the main figures especially the 
ones who are agitating the crowd police sgt rentaro ataka said 
around midnight 
police officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
10000 more riot police were on alert to prevent another night of 
rioting about 100 undercover police also were mobilized they 
said 
rioting did not spread beyond the neighborhood but it caused 
traffic tieups in parts of osaka as police blocked off several 
major streets and some rail service was disrupted 
the violence was touched off tuesday by the arrest of a local 
policeman on suspicion of having taken 81000 in bribes from two 
gangsters 
after hearing the news menial laborers with longstanding 
grudges against police began massing around the police station 
authorities and residents said young hooligans and leftists from 
outside the district later joined the disturbance 
rentarou ataka a police spokesman in nishinari said youths 
from outside the area had seen the initial rioting on television 
and decided to join in he described other troublemakers as 
ultraleftists but said the scope of their participation was 
unclear 
in recent years there have been few such disturbances in japan 
other than occasional battles between riot police and leftist 
extremists who oppose expansion of tokyos narita airport 
police reported two stores were set ablaze early friday and a 
train station also was heavily damaged by fire several shops 
including a 24hour convenience store were looted 
osakas police chief masahiro tsubakihara issued an apology 
for the officer who was arrested after reports he provided 
information about police operations against gangs

two years after dozens of hispanics were rounded 
up at a racetrack lawyers say they have won a major victory over 
government officials who tried to deport the people without proving 
they were illegal aliens 
the case was widely viewed as a test of alien rights the 
defendants refused to answer questions about how and when they 
entered the country citing fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination 
the immigration and naturalization service argued that this 
silence on its own demonstrated that the defendants were illegal 
aliens last year an immigration judge agreed 
but three weeks ago the federal board of immigration appeals 
reversed that ruling ending the deportation proceedings against 
one of the defendants 
the appeals board said the ins approach would shift the burden 
of proof at a deportation proceeding 
since the decision people have come forward to say federal 
immigration officials used similar tactics in other cases said dan 
kanstroom a boston college law professor who assisted in the 
appeal 
but he said the boston case marked the first national test of 
this strategy 
its very important that it stopped here he said 
daniel levy staff attorney at the national immigration law 
center in los angeles said if the governments arguments had been 
upheld it would have significantly broadened ins powers 
they would have been able to stop anybody on the street send 
them to court and if the person remains quiet the person could be 
deported levy said in a telephone interview 
verne jervis spokesman for the ins said friday that agency 
officials were still reviewing the boards decision and had not 
decided what action to take 
during the dawn raid oct 21 1988 at suffolk downs 
authorities seized 83 salvadoran mexican brazilian and cuban 
stable hands 
of those people six were found to be in the united states 
lawfully some of the remainder returned to their homelands while 
others admitted their illegal status and applied for asylum 
by the time the appeals board issued its decision 30 defendants 
remained 
on friday lawyers who teamed up to fight the ins gathered to 
plot their next moves the appeals board decision specifically 
discussed the case of only one defendant but kanstroom said it 
would apply to the others 
the clients can choose to have their deportation proceedings 
terminated or may eventually decide to return home or can take 
other steps such as seeking political asylum he said 
judith gail dein one of the lawyers who filed the appeal said 
no matter what the clients decide the appeals board has sent a 
strong message against the violation of peoples basic rights 
it feels real good that somebody put a stop to that she 
said

the decline of american banks compared with 
their foreign competitors threatens to harm an already weak us 
economy and diminish the nations world influence a congressional 
report concludes 
a house banking committee task force chaired by rep john j 
lafalce dny strongly suggested that the depressionera 
constraints barring banks from expanding into new services such as 
securities underwriting and insurance must fall if us banks are 
to regain their edge 
there appears to be little doubt that repeal of the securities 
restrictions imposed on us banks would enhance the 
competitiveness of us banks globally it said 
the panel also criticized remaining barriers preventing banks 
from expanding across state lines and compares the convoluted us 
regulatory system with its more streamlined counterparts overseas 
the 488page report which was conceived as a factfinding study 
rather than a vehicle for legislative recommendations has not been 
issued yet a draft circulated to the 20 task force members was 
obtained by the associated press it stresses the importance of a 
competitive banking system to the economy 
we must have a successful productive economy if we are to 
address societal needs and solve societal problems and a 
successful financial services delivery system is at the crux of a 
successful and productive economic machine the task force said 
the panel was formed last november and held a series of hearings 
through august with appearances from all of the major us 
financial regulators as well as private us and foreign business 
executives 
its research is intended by lafalce a strong advocate of 
expanding bank powers to serve as the basis for debate next year 
when the bush administration intends to submit its plan for the 
most significant overhaul of the us financial system in 50 years 
dramatic changes in financial services technology have 
increasingly shifted business away from banks toward other firms 
particularly brokerage houses the report said 
it is clear that the relative competitive position of us 
banks has deteriorated significantly as the us banking system has 
remained static in a changing world it said 
yet the us continues to develop policy for its financial 
services industry in a myopic and indeed isolationist way it 
said 
as europe prepares for economic union in 1992 its banks are 
increasingly adopting the universal banking model combining 
traditional commercial banking with securities underwriting and 
insurance the task force said 
the japanese financial structure is more split on paper but 
unofficial cooperative relationships among firms known as the 
keiretsu system allow japanese banks to provide a wider array 
of services than us banks it said 
thus it will become more difficult for us banks functioning 
under a decadesold system to compete at home and abroad it said 
increasingly us banks will be competing at home and abroad 
against foreign financial institutions that can offer customers a 
full array of financial services products us banks are not 
capable of providing it said 
foreign banks particularly japanese banks are making 
increasing inroads in the united states the report noted in 
california for instance japanese banks control about onequarter 
of all banking assets 
because of laws restricting the geographic expansion of us 
banks often it is easier for a foreign bank to acquire a us 
institution it said 
increasing foreign ownership of us banks raises important 
questions about americans ability to manage their own economy it 
said if foreign control of us financial institutions had been 
greater after the 1987 stock market crash the situation could 
have proved more difficult for the federal reserve to control 
the report said 
when credit is scarce us companies could find themselves at 
the tail end of a very long queue behind borrowers from britain 
japan west germany and other countries it said 
also a diminished us banking industry leaves us 
policymakers in the awkward position of being unable to help 
procure finance for the economic policies they encourage foreign 
governments to take

the military chief of the soviet union said 
friday that the most important thing in the persian gulf crisis 
is preventing it from escalating into a war 
i very much want everybody to attune their consciousness to 
the idea that youve got to find a political settlement and not be 
thinking about how best to use military force said gen mikhail 
a moiseyev chief of the soviet general staff 
president bush has not ruled out using the more than 
170000strong us sea air and land force in the gulf to try to 
dislodge the iraqi army from kuwait the washington post reported 
friday that bush has begun consulting with congress on the possible 
use of force 
moiseyev spoke at an unusual joint news conference at the 
pentagon with his american counterpart gen colin l powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
powell accompanied moiseyev on a crosscountry tour of us 
military and civilian sites including a visit friday to north 
island naval air station near san diego and to the cheyenne 
mountain complex in colorado headquarters of the north american 
air defense command 
moiseyev said that after leaving washington on friday evening he 
would stop in havana for a meeting with the chief of the cuban 
general staff 
at the news conference moiseyev deflected questions about the 
likely soviet response to a usled attack on iraqi forces in 
kuwait he stressed several times that moscow saw enormous danger 
in any military conflict in the gulf 
the most important thing for all of us is to not allow a 
military conflict to develop out of this situation the general 
said through an interpreter we have not exhausted the whole of 
the arsenal of political possibilities that we have at our 
disposal he added referring to the nations against iraq 
moiseyev also stressed in response to questions about the 
presence of soviet military specialists in iraq that they are 
gradually withdrawing and that their role is relatively 
unimportant 
these are not advisers he said these are technicians 
the general said the 206 soviet military specialists in iraq 
include 42 interpreters 15 members of a management team and 146 
technical specialists he did not mention the function of the 
other three 
moiseyev spoke warmly of his weeklong visit to the united 
states his first in addition to seeing military installations and 
equipment moiseyev and his staff visited national memorials in 
washington an automobile plant in michigan and san francisco 
we discovered america for ourselves he said we got 
convinced that americans are determined to keep the peace 
cooperate and further strengthen normal ties with the soviet union 
much has changed in our perception of america 
powell and moiseyev signed an agreement on military exchanges 
for 1991 and 1992 including a visit by powell to the soviet union 
next summer and a visit to the united states early next year by the 
soviet commander in chief of far east forces

advocates for the blind the obese and 
hispanics on friday questioned a federal regulation that says 
people with disabilities and no understanding of english cannot sit 
next to exit doors on us airlines 
the federal aviation administration regulation says only people 
who are able and willing to open exit doors in emergencies and 
understand flight crews and assist them with evacuations may be 
seated next to the doors the regulation took effect friday 
people barred from such seats include parents with small 
children people considered too frail to operate the door 
passengers with broken limbs and other disabilities the obese 
children under 15 and the blind 
some airlines already prohibit blind travelers from sitting in 
exitdoor seats and several sightless people have been arrested in 
recent years for refusing to move from seats 
marc maurer president of the national federation of the blind 
said the rule is discriminatory and called it an example of the 
fear that people have of being blind 
a blind person is accustomed to dealing with working without 
lights he said they dont have a single piece of evidence 
that shows that blind people are hazardous yet they make this 
judgement 
others said they were concerned with how the faa would determine 
obesity or the ability to read and understand english 
i understand the faas concern but i feel theyre making 
certainly an arbitrary judgment about the mobility of fat 
people said sally e smith executive director of the national 
association to advance fat acceptance 
were very concerned about the potential disparate effect of 
the proposed regulation on hispanics and others said charles 
kamasaki vice president for research advocacy and legislation for 
the national council of la raza a hispanic organization 
are they going to give iq tests what constitutes limited 
english proficiency even if the regulation were justified were 
concerned about its application in practice he said 
paul steucke a spokesman for the faa said airlines were 
directed to come up with their own guidelines to determine who is 
qualified to sit next to the exits 
theres discretion involved he said you might have 
somebody whos 250 pounds if theyre 6foot4 there probably wont 
be a problem if theyre 4foot1 there might be 
william e oriol a spokesman for the national council on the 
aging aid the organization was still examining the regulation 
reaction from passengers who traveled through three us 
airports on friday was mixed 
some said they were concerned about the englishonly provision 
they already have everything written in english and spanish 
anyway maybe they should have bilingual people sitting there 
said jennette heck who flew in to miami from new orleans but i 
dont think handicapped people should sit right by the door they 
could get hurt in the panic 
martin cohen 48 of easton pa favored the rule 
i have a young child and when im traveling with her they 
dont want us to sit next to the emergency door said cohen who 
was at bostons logan international airport the idea is to get 
the exit open in a plane crash you should have someone who could 
open the exit 
jeff bank 27 of new york who also was in boston said you 
have to do whats necessary to protect all the passengers and it 
just makes sense

a traveling exhibit of robert mapplethorpes 
photographs closed friday leaving in its wake protests and a 
conservative attack on the national endowment for the arts 
at an earlier stop in cincinnati the exhibit prompted an 
obscenity prosecution of an art gallery and its director a case 
that ended friday in acquittal the jury in the nations first such 
prosecution of an art gallery rejected prosecutors argument that 
seven of the pictures were obscene 
cincinnatis contemporary art gallery and its director dennis 
barrie were acquitted of charges of pandering obscenity and using 
children in nudityrelated material 
some say the furor surrounding the trial and the traveling 
exhibit has helped the art world by drawing record crowds to 
galleries and forcing artists to become politically active to 
support their work 
it has brought a lot of artists out of their studios to 
organize and demonstrate their own moral and political strength for 
the first time since the end of the vietnam war said david ross 
director of the institute of contemporary art in boston where the 
photos were exhibited 
i think the silver lining has been that the art world has been 
given a sense of direction that it didnt have before 
the exhibit combined mapplethorpes explicit homoerotic 
photographs the source of the controversy with cool elegant 
portraits and photographs of flowers mapplethorpe helped organize 
the show shortly before he died of aids in march 1989 at age 42 
boston was the last stop on the exhibits sevencity tour about 
103000 people saw the show during its nine weeks at the institute 
about twice the number that visited the museum all last year said 
arthur cohen director of marketing membership in the museum also 
has surged recently he added 
but cohen said the increased income from the show was offset by 
higher security and insurance costs the net income came to less 
than half the amount lost in grants recently 
were not even coming out even he said 
in washington dc 48000 people saw the show during its 
threeweek stay at the washington project for the arts a popular 
10week exhibit there usually draws 8000 said philip brookman 
who curated that show after it was canceled at the corcoran gallery 
of art 17 months ago 
our membership has increased quite a bit our attendance has 
been consistently high since the mapplethorpe show brookman 
said it was received very positively by critics and the public 
at large mothers came in with their children 
others saw the shows aftermath differently 
were worse off for mapplethorpe in the long run were much 
worse off said rita burke president of morality in media of 
massachusetts 
burke said the lesson for her in the mapplethorpe show was that 
the normal person is helpless to fight the media 
i think it has raised consciousness to how difficult it is for 
the average person who is really turned off by material like 
this she said i find that an awful lot of people are giving 
up they wring their hands 
the exhibit attracted little attention in its first showings in 
philadelphia and chicago but in washington it caught the eye of 
sen jesse helms rnc 
helms and other congressional conservatives were angered by 
several photographs with homosexual and sadomasochistic subjects 
their attack forced the corcoran to cancel the show in mid1989 
since then the focus has shifted to two photographs of two 
children with exposed genitals 
morality in media was unsuccessful in attempts to bring criminal 
charges against the boston institute 
the controversy has also forced the national endowments new 
director john frohnmayer to institute a requirement that artists 
sign a statement agreeing to not use nea funds to make obscene art 
some have turned down grants in protest 
frohnmayer also rejected four grants approved by peer review 
panels that would have gone to controversial artists the nea 
four as they are known in arts circles filed suit in federal 
court on sept 27 asking for the 23000 in grants or a review of 
their applications the four had all received nea grants in the 
past

a 250000 reward will be paid to a california 
woman whose testimony helped convict her mother in two killings 
with cyanidelaced excedrin a spokesman for a pharmaceutical group 
said friday 
an additional 50000 will be shared by eight others who helped 
convict stella nickell of auburn wash in the deaths of her 
husband and another woman the spokesman said 
the nonprescription drug manufacturers association had offered 
the rewards for information leading to an arrest in the june 1986 
killings which led to the nations first trial in a 
producttampering death 
cynthia hamilton 30 the nickells daughter who now lives in 
garden grove calif testified that mrs nickell repeatedly talked 
about ways to kill her husband bruce nickell who was 52 when he 
died 
prosecutors said mrs nickell put cyanide in capsules of 
extrastrength excedrin and gave them to her husband she also 
planted other bottles of cyanidetainted excedrin in stores in 
local stores to divert suspicion authorities said 
mrs nickell had three life insurance policies on her husband 
the other victim was susan katherine snow 40 also of auburn who 
authorities said had bought the poisoned capsules 
the deaths sparked a nationwide tampering scare and prompted 
excedrin manufacturer bristolmyers co to recall its 
overthecounter capsule medications 
mrs nickell was convicted two years later 
the reward is the second paid by the pharmaceutical group 
another 300000 was shared by nine people who helped police arrest 
a florida man in 1986 authorities said he put rat poison in 
capsules of several smithkline beckman corp products in florida 
and texas in a failed scheme to manipulate the price of smithkline 
stock 
we offered the rewards as a deterrent because we feel that the 
best way to deter tampering is to catch the tamperers said john 
t walden a senior vice president of the nonprescription drug 
manufacturers association 
rewards authorized for two other drugtampering cases remain 
unpaid 
the association authorized a 200000 reward for information 
leading to an arrest and conviction in the 1986 death of diane 
elsroth of yonkers ny who took cyanidelaced tylenol he said 
the same amount is offered in the 1982 chicagoarea deaths of 
seven people who also were killed with tainted tylenol capsules 
he said 
the eight who will also share in the reward in the nickell case 
are thomas noonan of auburn wash 15000 bonnie anderson of 
federal way wash 10000 denise button of seattle 7500

air quality officials friday ordered 
makers of charcoal lighter lluid to cook up a cleanerburning 
product by 1992 or face a ban on barbecuers favorite fuel 
the air quality management district trying to clean up the 
skies over the los angeles area took on a summer way of life for 2 
million californians by voting 101 to impose strict standards on 
lighter fluid and selfstarting charcoal briquettes 
experts say lighter fluids contribute more harmful emissions 
than many people would think an estimated 2 tons per day of 
smogforming hydrocarbon emissions thats a little more than the 
average oil refinery belches into the air each day 
on a hot summer day fluids can emit up to 4 tons of emissions 
board member mike antonovich the only one to oppose the plan 
called it a waste of time and said it placed an unfair burden on 
store owners he said backyard chefs could get around the plan by 
buying lighter fluid at stores outside of the air quality district 
which covers four counties around los angeles 
the rule doesnt set any penalties for using the lighter fluid 
just for selling it he said 
instead of aiming our big guns at the automobiles were 
nuking the barbecue antonovich said 
the barbecue industry opposed the plan and asked for more time 
to reformulate its products lighter fluid sales amount to more 
than 5 million in southern california every year 
industry is willing able and ready to reformulate said pat 
meehan of the barbecue industry association were concerned 
about air quality too 
most members of the naperville illbased association make 
charcoal briquettes and fluid rather than electric or other 
lighters 
but board members said the industry has had plenty of time to 
improve its lighter fluid and that it still has a chance to 
reformulate its products 
ive been trying to clean the air for 20 years whereve you 
been asked board member marvin braude representing los angeles 
county you could have done it last year the year before or 
five years ago 
braude drew hisses from the audience when he cut off meehan in 
midsentence and said he didnt want to hear from the industry 
representative any more 
while the board considered the plan inside the aqmd staff 
cooked hot dogs and stuffed bell peppers outside the charcoal was 
lighted by wood chips newspapers and electric prods methods 
officials say are cleaner than lighter fluids 
inside the hearing room industry representatives illustrated 
their presentation with slides showing cans of lighter fluid 
different sizes of barbecues and clumps of charcoal briquettes 
speakers included a condominium owner who said his complex had 
banned lighter fluids because elderly residents were getting ill 
and a campground operator who urged the board to continue selling 
lighter fluids because other methods he said were dangerous 
the strict lighter fluid rules are the latest in a series of 
tough measures the aqmd has taken to clean southern california 
skies 
so far this year the districts fourcounty area has recorded 35 
firststage smog alerts the least serious of three levels of 
alert when children the elderly and those with respiratory 
diseases are warned to avoid strenuous activity the district 
covers los angeles riverside orange and western san bernardino 
counties 
the lighter fluid rule requires manufacturers to drastically 
reduce lighter fluid emissions and bans the sale of fluids 
exceeding the new limits as of jan 1 1992 merchants who violate 
the rule face fines as high as 25000 per day 
the new limits would reduce the allowed emissions of volatile 
hydrocarbons from 09 pounds per barbecue event to 02 pounds 
according to the barbecue industry emissions from fluid and 
selfstarting charcoal represent 2 percent of the total emissions 
in the los angeles basin less than the aqmd contends cars by 
comparison emit 315 percent of the total 
barbecue industry spokeswoman sandy burton said the industry and 
the aqmd would continue to work together on testing methods and 
that the industry may well be able to bring its products into 
compliance 
its not a matter of being happy or not happy right now she 
said were going to continue to work on this

while the brunt of a government shutdown 
saturday would not hit for three days visitors to the statue of 
liberty the washington monument and yellowstone national park 
would feel the effects at once 
white house budget director richard darman told agency heads 
they should be ready to send home all nonessential employees 
scheduled to work saturday his memo cited the failure by congress 
to pass legislation to fund the government byond a midnight friday 
deadline 
the bulk of the federal work force of 24 million was told to 
report to work tuesday even if only to be sent home after a few 
hours monday is a federal holiday 
barring a lastminute compromise this would be the fourth time 
over the past decade that the federal government has sent its 
employees home because its authority to spend money expired the 
last time in 1986 the impasse lasted half a day 
then the statue of liberty the washington monument and st 
louis gateway arch all were closed because park service workers 
were sent home 
this time tourists to the nations captial would find the 
smithsonian institutions 12 museums closed too white house 
gardeners hung up their rakes and left 
the park service prepared to shut down these monuments saturday 
and to padlock everything that can be padlocked said bob 
walker a spokesman for the interior department 
if a visitor wants to drive into yellowstone or shenandoah 
park therell be no one there to keep them out or charge them a 
toll to get in but those people would be largely on their own 
walker said if their car broke down there would be no friendly 
ranger to help them 
the postal service would not be affected by the shutdown because 
it is not dependent on government appropriations 
amtrak rail passenger service would not be immediately affected 
for the same reason it does however receive a large government 
subsidy so that its operations would be hard hit if the budget 
impasse is long lasting 
president bush convened an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss 
details of a government shutdown 
his spokesman marlin fitzwater said there would be significant 
disruptions of government services beginning on saturday and each 
day they would grow a little worse 
each agency decides what is an essential service but 
generally employees whose jobs are needed for protecting public 
health or safety such as air traffic controllers prison guards 
and the military would be allowed to keep working 
beginning saturday morning the head of each agency must be 
prepared to implement his or her existing plan for closing down 
operations darman said in a memo to the agency heads 
only those services needed to protect life and property will 
be permitted to continue in the absence of a budget agreement 
darman said 
a spokesman for the federal aviation administration bob 
buckhorn said that if we have a shutdown essential services 
remain in place including air traffic controllers other faa 
employes who deal with safety would also continue working he said 
every office in the commerce department except the national 
weather service would be affected by a shutdown a commerce 
spokesman said 
the shutdown would hit nasa at an awkward time shortly before 
midnight fueling is to begin for an early morning launch of the 
space shuttle discovery 
no one is suggesting a layoff for the five astronauts who 
during the fourday mission are scheduled to deploy the ulysses 
probe on its fiveyear journey to the sun 
however the government technically will lack the authority to 
pay employees for their work because none of the 13 appropriations 
bills needed to fund the government for the fiscal year that began 
monday has been enacted 
after the government was forced to shut down briefly in 1981 
1984 and 1986 congress voted to reimburse all federal employees 
for lost pay 
this time the situation was complicated by the fact that the 
governments power to borrow money was also expiring at midnight 
friday unless congress passed and bush signed an extension of the 
federal debt limit 
at the agriculture department workers who normally work on 
weekends primarily forest service workers were told they would 
likely be sent home saturday 
kelly ship a department spokeswoman said only that a handful 
of the departments 100000 employees nationwide would be 
considered essential and expected to report to work during a 
shutdown she added 
state and county offices of major usda agencies such as the 
farmers home administration and the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service would close 
federal meat and poultry inspection however would continue 
during a general shutdown she said 
a pentagon spokesman said senior department officials were in 
closed meetings friday afternoon discussing what actions would be 
required on saturday if the government were shut down 
the spokesman jim turner said the department would not comment 
on its contingency plans 
the pentagon has more than 3 million employees including 21 
million uniformed personnel it appeared unlikely that any forced 
shutdown of defense department operations would affect the 
deployment of more than 170000 servicemen and women in the persian 
gulf 
at the state department officials said that all personnel are 
expected to show up tuesday but that nonessential employees would 
be sent home no estimate was available on the number of employees 
in that category 
the officials asking not to be identified said the impact on 
overseas posts is likely to be minimal for the time being 
they added that the budget situation would not affect the state 
department task force monitoring the persian gulf crisis

a fundamentalist cabinet minister and 
senior clergymen on friday urged moslems to retaliate against the 
us military intervention in the persian gulf 
we cannot retaliate against the united saates itself because 
vast oceans separate us but we now have the opportunity to 
retaliate against the american troops and other crusaders who are a 
stones throw from us ali alfakir minister of religious 
affairs told 10000 worshippers attending a prayer sermon 
alfakir a sheik who was elected to parliament last year 
previously has stressed that political statements he makes at 
friday prayer gatherings or reflect only his personal opinion and 
not that of the government 
i assure you that you will take them captives and shackle them 
with chains as moslems did with crusaders in the 12th century he 
told the crowd at hamzah mosque in the suburb of marka five miles 
east of amman 
fakir also blasted egypt and syria for committing troops to the 
usled military buildup in saudi arabia after iraqs aug 2 
invasion of saudi arabia 
many moslems view the presence of nonmoslem forces in the 
kingdom that harbors islams holiest shrines at mecca and medina as 
an insult to their faith 
that decision by cairo and damascus was inspired by material 
motives which is dearer to the nation kuwait or palestine he 
said criticizing the arabs failure to fight israel to regain 
territories lost in the 1967 war including jerusalem 
which is more sacred the oil wells or jerusalems alaqsa 
mosque he said referring to islams third holiest shrine 
the jordanian government has officially condemned the invasion 
of kuwait and called for an iraqi withdrawal however as a close 
ally of iraq it has denounced the foreign military intervention in 
the region urging an arab solution to the problem

under pressure from town officials a 
theater canceled henry and june a movie that premiered friday 
with the new adultsonly rating nc17 
the motion picture association of america said the decision 
brought back the dark ages of censorship and professor alan 
dershowitz of harvard law school who is representing henry and 
june director philip kaufman said kaufman was considering legal 
action against the town 
its a clear violation of the constitution and a clear 
violation of civil rights dershowitz said the only basis on 
which you can legally ban movies is if they are legally obscene 
and the ratings dont go to that 
the mpaa replaced the x rating with the nc17 rating on sept 
26 nc17 means children under age 17 cannot be admitted 
showcase cinema called off fridays opening of henry and 
june at its dedham theater after complaints from two selectmen 
the film is based on the diaries of anais nin and chronicles her 
affairs with writer henry miller and his wife 
kaufman said his movie covers a range of important adult themes 
including sexuality creativity and duplicity 
theres this kind of blindness to this film that i find not 
only confusing and unfair kaufman said its also i feel not 
part of the tradition of a free country it amounts to 
censorship 
what two city officials in dedham have done is to go backward 
into the dark ages of censorship when witches were burned at the 
stake said mpaa chief executive officer jack valenti 
anthony taurasi chairman of the towns board of selectmen said 
showcase cinema had a gentlemans agreement with the town not to 
show xrated films and that the nc17 rating was just a way 
around the ratings bureau 
they can call it whatever they want to call it taurasi 
said if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its a 
duck lets call it what it is 
both taurisi and selectman frank geishecker said they had not 
seen the universal pictures release which stars fred ward and uma 
thurman 
an mpaa spokeswoman said she had heard of no other disputes over 
the nc17 rating 
ira korf chief executive officer of showcase cinemas parent 
company national amusements inc said friday his company had 
thought nc17 would be added to the rating system rather than 
replace the x designation 
we thought that the x would remain korf said in a 
statement 
the association changed the rating designation because the x 
rating carried the stigma of pornography 
henry and june was given the nc17 rating because of two 
lesbian sex scenes and a shot of an erotic drawing 
korf said national amusements had not seen the rating guide in 
writing and wanted to examine it further before taking a permanent 
stand on the nc17 rating 
we decided that we would respect the local communitys wishes 
until we have had time to further study the matter korf said 
more than 25000 people live in dedham about 10 miles south of 
boston 
henry amp june was scheduled to open on 77 screens in 31 
cities in the united states and canada friday

president bush vetoed a bill friday imposing 
tight quotas on imports of textiles and shoes saying the measure 
picks the pockets of us consumers by drastically driving up 
prices to the tune of 2600 per family over four years 
he called the measure reprehensible and said it would cause 
an economic calamity by forcing a collapse of international 
trade talks 
congress had ignored threats of a veto in enacting the 
legislation which imposes quotas of its own on imports of 
textiles textile products and nonrubber shoes 
trade in textiles is regulated by international agreements which 
impose other quotas 
this highly protectionist bill would damage the national 
economy increase already artificially high costs to consumers of 
several basic goos and abrogate our international agreements 
bush said in a veto message 
disputing claims by the bills supporters bush said the textile 
industry was doing well domestic production has been up slightly 
since 1987 he said and unemployment in major textileproducing 
states is lower than the national average 
economic indicators illustrate that the problems this bill is 
intended to address do not exist bush said 
the consumer costs of all restrictions on textile and apparel 
imports are conservatively estimated to increase to a total of 160 
billion over the next five years bush said that amounts to an 
onerous 2600 for a family of four over that same period 
these costs would continue to rise annually he added in 
essence this legislation picks the pockets of us consumers in 
order to subsidize the textile industry at a cost of 70000 
annually per job saved 
bush said there would be swift retaliation against the united 
states by nations hit by the quotas us companies would be 
particularly hard hit in agriculture aerospace high technology 
capital goods and services he said 
moreover he said this protectionist bill unquestionably 
would result in a mass exodus of perhaps half the 100 nations 
participating in the international trade talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade

the head of president bushs church on friday 
urged that he remain steadfast and never give in to the trap of 
war in the present middle east crisis 
presiding episcopal bishop edmond l browning said an atmosphere 
of tensions apparent diplomatic stalemate and threat of war 
had moved him to speak out on the situation 
in a statement addressed to the churchs bishops and its 25 
million members including bush browning called for cooperative 
and peaceful solutions 
in spite of the near unanimity of the united nations in 
confronting the crisis the time is fraught with danger he said 
huge armies and armadas led by those of our own country face 
each other with the promise of unimaginable destruction and 
havoc 
although supporting the un sanctions against iraqs naked 
aggression and saying iraq must withdraw completely from iraq 
browning questioned some western motives 
for what reason has our nation unleashed the greatest military 
force since the vietnam war he said are we not justified in 
suspecting that the reason is primarily economic having to do with 
unimpeded access to oil 
he urged examination of our national priorites and our 
addiction to unnecessary consumption 
he said he prayed that bush adhere to un resolutions and i 
pray for him as he wrestles with the difficult decisions of his 
office i urge that he remain steadfast and never give in to the 
trap of war 
declaring this is not a time for propaganda but for sober 
truth browning cautioned that we not demonize stereotype or 
oversimplify in assessments of the iraqi people 
resist the misplaced national pride which refuses to recognize 
the face of christ in your brother and sister in iraq and the 
middle east 
browning said the crisis is interconnected with the palestinian 
problem and must be seen in that light rather than as an isolated 
incident 
he said i continue to believe firmly that the united nations 
and the arab states themselves working in concert offer the best 
hope for a bloodless solution to the conflict

zoo director warren thomas announced his 
retirement friday less than a month after federal inspectors cited 
the zoo for more than 100 violations of the animal welfare act 
mayor tom bradley said thomas departure provides an opportunity 
to reexamine zoo operations but denied the director was being 
forced out of the 83000peryear job he held for 17 years 
this was a volunteer action on his part bradley said at a 
news conference 
thomass last day on the job will be jan 4 
i will leave with a variety of emotions one of which will be 
of course sadness thomas 59 said in a news release 
however my successor will inherit one of the great animal 
collections of the world and a dedicated group of experienced zoo 
professionals and im proud of that too 
last month the us department of agriculture cited the zoo for 
more than 100 violations including storage of toxic substances 
near food additives and medicine dead mice inadequate housing and 
rundown animal barns 
if not remedied the violations could lead to thousands of 
dollars in fines and revocation of the zoos license a bond 
measure on this falls election ballot would provide some 30 
million for badly needed repairs 
federal inspectors who visited the zoo on thursday said most of 
the problems had been corrected said assistant recreation and 
parks director sheldon jensen 
thomas also came under fire for allegedly keeping a cash account 
for special projects without notifying his city government 
supervisors the los angeles times reported that thomas funded the 
account with fees paid by film crews that used the zoo 
the greater los angeles zoo association which held the account 
said thomas withdrew money for various zoo projects and for a 
recent trip the association said there was no indication any of 
the money was misspent

the mutiny on the philippines 
secondlargest island again tarnished the image of president 
corazon aquinos government which stood to lose no matter how the 
revolt ended 
politicians demanded firm action against col alexander noble 
who launched the seventh rebellion against mrs aquinos 
4yearold government on thursday noble organized a private army 
after taking part in a failed coup in december 
he surrendered early saturday after trying to sneak out of the 
military garrison he captured two days earlier 
government must now take the strongest possible measures to 
ensure that this become the last challenge that military rebels 
ever make against constitutional authority said house speaker 
ramon mitra 
such statements have accompanied the previous coup attempts 
against mrs aquino since she took power in the february 1986 
people power revolution that overthrew president ferdinand 
marcos 
ordinarily however the mutineers simply surrender after 
protracted negotiations key leaders of past revolts have 
disappeared ordinary soldiers are then sent to different units for 
retraining 
senior commanders appeared fearful that bloodshed would further 
divide the armed forces and encourage sympathy for brother 
soldiers within the ranks 
it would also play into the hands of renegade officers who 
portray the aquino government as elitist and corrupt 
in a statement friday the underground young officers union 
accused the military leadership of barking orders from their 
airconditioned rooms and cellularequipped luxury cars while 
disregarding the hardships of common soldiers 
sen ernesto maceda chairman of the senate defense committee 
alluded to this when he urged the government to address problems of 
pay promotions and living conditions in the military 
how many times do we have to give this warning before 
president aquino listens maceda said the aquino government 
must for once to meaningfully and substantially respond to the 
problems of our people 
the latest revolt was all the more embarrassing because the 
military had been predicting for months that mutineers would stage 
an uprising on mindanao possibly as a prelude to a coup attempt in 
manila 
furthermore the military launched operations in august to 
capture noble and regaled the media daily with reports that the 
colonel would soon be captured 
instead he and his forces managed to travel more than 100 miles 
across northern mindanao encountering no resistance 
there is little likelihood that noble can topple the aquino 
administration but there is a very real threat that the aquino 
officials may expire from sheer embarrassment commentator luis 
beltran wrote in the manila standard 
unfortunately it looks like the only thing this 
administration is capable of capturing is the common cold 
most filipinos have little sympathy for military rebels but the 
inability of the government to control the dissidents has 
discredited a civilian administration that seems unable to deliver 
basic services control prices and guide national development 
that concern has been reflected in the business community which 
is already alarmed over the prospects of economic decline brought 
on by the persian gulf crisis and the effects of julys earthquake 
that killed more than 1600 people 
economists already have revised economic prospects downward 
because of rising oil prices and the return of thousands of 
filipinos who were working in the middle east 
in a speech friday herman montenegro chairman of the annual 
conference of the chamber of commerce warned of a crisis of 
confidence in mrs aquino 
the government must dispel the fear that a military coup is a 
distinct possibility at any time he said 
also friday the central bank reported businesses transferred 
148 million abroad in the first six months of the year an 
increase of more than 400 percent over the same time last year 
in an editorial friday the progovernment newspaper the manila 
chronicle warned that instability was sapping the nations viality 
the governments mistakes and shortcomings of the past 
have exhausted the nation the newspaper said though most 
people still look forward to the 1992 elections for some possible 
relief there are those who are becoming seduced by the idea of an 
earlier more radical change 
 
editors note robert h reid has been the ap bureau chief in 
manila for the past four years

saddam hussein carried on talks with a top soviet official 
friday while his foreign minister accused the united states and its 
allies of pushing the world to the brink of a devastating war 
us ambassador thomas r pickering called iraqs address to the 
general assembly an insult to the iraqi people who deserve to be 
told no more lies 
the united nations speech prepared by iraqi foreign minister 
tariq aziz was uncompromising accusing the security council of 
hypocrisy for criticizing iraqs invasion of kuwait while allowing 
israel to continue occupying arab lands seized in the 1967 and 1973 
wars 
the speech came in response to president bushs demand for iraq 
to end its 9weekold occupation of neighboring kuwait 
soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky later rebuked 
iraq saying we cannot but feel some satisfaction at the 
unprecedented unity in the security council that we think is 
the promise that the united nations can deal with this highly 
dangerous international crisis 
in washington the state department said about 300 americans and 
foreignborn family members have signed up for an evacuation flight 
due to leave kuwait on wednesday us officials estimate at least 
900 americans remain trapped in kuwait and iraq following saddams 
invasion of the oilrich emirate aug 2 
aziz accused america and its allies of seeking to gain control 
over the oil reserves in the gulf so as to have a free hand in 
manipulating the needs of the world and especially the needs of 
the peoples of the third world for this important commodity 
the speech delivered friday afternoon by iraqs secondranked 
un representative sabah talat kadrat because aziz was not in new 
york reiterated saddams view that all middle east problems 
palestine lebanon the gulf and others be considered on the 
same basis and on an equal footing 
kadrat stalked out of the hall later with the entire iraqi 
delegation when a kuwaiti delegate d razzooqi replied that 
there are no falsifications of facts similar to what we have 
heard from the representative of dictator saddam hussein 
we are going to return to kuwait god willing we will 
return razzooqi declared 
saudi arabias ambassador samir shihabi accused iraq of an 
unforgivable crime a crime to shine in the history of crimes by 
swallowing up other countries through looting through pillage 
through invasion 
noting that kuwait had helped finance iraq during its war with 
iran in the 1980s shihabi said it seems that kuwait was feeding 
a snake a snake which would swallow up its neighbors 
bush demanded an unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait but 
suggested before the world body monday that there could be 
opportunities later to promote negotiations on israels 
occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
britain and france have made similar suggestions which could 
allow saddam a facesaving exit from the oilrich emirate 
in baghdad saddam met with an aide to mikhail s gorbachev and 
accepted a message from the soviet president the official iraqi 
news agency did not disclose the contents of the message 
the news agency said saddam and the soviet envoy yevgeny 
primakov discussed the gulf crisis and stressed the desire for 
peace soviet diplomatic sources reported that primakov urged 
saddam to cooperate with un resolutions demanding the iraqi 
pullout 
it was not clear if they discussed the plight of 5000 soviets 
unable to leave iraq about 4500 of the soviets in iraq are key 
oil industry workers most are employed in new oil fields being 
developed by iraq 
the iraqis are now dependent on these oil people a source 
in baghdad said on condition of anonymity if they go no one 
else will come in to operate these fields 
other soviets in iraq are military advisers who had been 
training iraqi soldiers in the use of sovietmade weaponry and 
other equipment moscow was iraqs largest weapons supplier before 
aug 2 but cut trade after the invasion 
meanwhile in washington five senators called for a pentagon 
investigation of how iraq might have obtained the technology to 
make fuelair explosives for extremely powerful bombs that can 
spread their blast over a wide area 
the explosives have 10 times the power of conventional 
explosives and create a huge fireball and shock wave over a 
concentrated area without the radiation fallout associated with 
nuclear weapons according to pentagon officials 
the senators are concerned that a german company 
messerschmittboelkowblohm may have given away the formulas 
needed to make the xplosives which were used by us forces in 
vietnam 
military officials say the united states has no ready defense 
against the explosives which could devastate oil fields air bases 
and troops the newspaper reported 
the united states now has 170000 troops in saudi arabia and on 
ships in the area making up most of the estimated 200000member 
international force the pentagon says iraq has massed 460000 
troops in kuwait since the invasion

congress completes a broad budget outline by then fitzwater said 
only those services needed to protect life and property will 
be permitted in the absence of a budget white house budget 
director richard darman wrote in a memo to agency chiefs 
with the long weekend about to start it seemed likely that the 
full brunt of the shutdown would not be felt until tuesday but the 
park service was preparing to close the statue of liberty the 
washington monument and other tourist favorites at least for the 
weekend 
most of the nations 24 million federal workers were told to 
report on tuesday after mondays federal holiday even if only 
to be sent home after they arrived 
congressional leaders of both parties met with administration 
officials to grope for a deficitcutting plan that would be 
acceptable to lawmakers just a month shy of election day 
democrats sought support for a new plan with fewer cuts for the 
elderly and the poor but there were no signs that republicans were 
willing to accept it 
democrats also said they would be willing to consider cuts in 
the capital gains tax rate a republican proposal in exchange for 
higher taxes for the rich budget negotiators had rejected the 
tradeoff last week 
earlier in a thursday night session that stretched into friday 
morning a rebellious house overwhelmingly defeated the 
500billion compromise package of tax boosts and spending slashes 
that bush and congressional leaders preferred 
that vote was an embarrassment to administration officials and 
top lawmakers of both parties who had waged an allout lobbying 
thrust on behalf of the measure uncertainty reigned on capitol 
hill 
this thing could be who knows said a confused rep robert 
matsui dcalif 
the president has 10 days to decide whether to sign a bill he is 
sent by congress until a measure is signed it does not become 
law 
democrats hoped that by sending the emergency spending bill to 
bush the president and not congress would be blamed for the 
closure 
but lawmakers of both parties agreed that all sides looked bad 
in light of the seemingly endless budget battle 
rep jack buechner rmo tugged on a tie bearing a mickey 
mouse pattern and said everybody ought to have these on today 
the houses 254179 rejection of the budget was driven by 
unhappiness among members of all stripes conservatives disliked 
its 134 billion in taxes and as well as its spending cuts they 
considered overly gentle 
liberals thought the 60 billion in medicare reductions 
including cuts in benefits were too steep they said the plans 
higher levies on gasoline heating oil tobacco and alcohol would 
hit the poor too hard 
and members of both parties said they resented the process by 
which the package was written four months of closeddoor summit 
talks involving only congressional leaders and administration 
officials 
house speaker thomas s foley said he believed that as a result 
lawmakers should try to write a budget themselves perhaps with 
reduced medicare cuts and a lesser tax burden for lowincome 
people 
we will of course keep in touch with the white house but i 
do not anticipate the resumption of anything that would be 
called summit talks he said 
foley said he wanted a budget that would be supported by a 
majority of democrats and republicans i am not of the opinion 
that political warfare is of some value at this point he said 
but not all lawmakers agreed conservative republicans urged 
bush to keep the government shut down until democrats agreed to 
limit federal spending 
a budget plan ought to be put together by the president in 
consultation with republicans said rep tom delay rtexas 
tell the democrats to put up their best shot well sustain every 
veto hes got

an unarmed soviet man forced an 
aeroflot airliner on a domestic flight with 26 people aboard to 
land in finland on friday and then asked for political asylum 
the soviet embassy requested the extradition of the 40yearold 
hijacker identified by police as nikolai ivanovich selivanov the 
foreign ministry said 
the hijacker surrendered soon after the 28seat yak40 aircraft 
touched down police said none of the 21 other passengers or four 
crew members was hurt and the plane flew to leningrad later friday 
evening 
the hijacker walked out of the plane to meet finnish police who 
took him to central helsinki for interrogation 
passengers said the man used no violence to hijack the plane but 
warned them it would explode if something happened to him one 
passenger said the hijacker claimed to have recently left a mental 
institution 
the hijacker wanted to go to stockholm but he was told there 
was not enough fuel chief inspector pertti virolainen told a 
news conference 
the small aircraft landed in helsinki two hours after takeoff 
from novgorod 310 miles northwest of moscow it was on its way to 
petrozavodsk via leningrad 
fifteen minutes after we took off a thin pale 
nervouslooking man walked up to the hostess and handed her a 
note said yevgeni khodorkovsky a 32yearold passenger 
passengers said the hijacker walked up and down the aisle of the 
plane and visited the toilet several times 
he kept on looking out of the windows and when he saw the 
islands below he smiled said passenger antonina urjetskaya 68 
of novgorod 
i heard the hijacker saying that he had a friend on board and 
if something happens to him then his friend would blow up the 
plane mrs urjetskaya said 
the hijacker mentioned no motive for the hijacking except 
rather unclear strange circumstances in his life khodorovsky 
said 
he said he had been unemployed for six months that his father 
was an invalid and he had just come out of a mental institution 
the passengers included a 2yearold and a 4yearold child 
all the passengers were of course very worried and we passed 
the two children from lap to lap so that they wouldnt run in the 
aisle mrs urjetskaya said 
my heart is in bad shape so i was very worried but i took a 
heart pill and i am very glad that the situation ended so well 
she said 
when the hijacker left the plane she said he announced he knew 
he had done something wrong but would rather be in jail in sweden 
than in the soviet union an air hostess had announced that the 
plane was landing in stockholm 
the passengers were taken by bus to an airport personnel 
cafeteria where they were interviewed by police 
a soviet embassy official at the airport asked if anyone else 
wanted to stay in finland khodorkovsky said the officials 
request was met with laughter 
khodorkovsky of leningrad said he and his wife had received 
exit visas to emigrate to israel 
earlier this year five domestic planes were hijacked to finland 
and to sweden by young men who said they were political dissidents 
or fugitives from the soviet army 
swedish and finnish officials extradited four of them one was 
given political asylum in sweden

the families of four people killed in the 1987 
crash of a continental airlines jet in denver will share 10 
million in an outofcourt settlement a lawyer says 
plaintiffs attorney michael sydow said thursday the case 
against the airline was settled a few hours before it was scheduled 
to go to court on monday 
but continental spokesman ned walker said friday the settlement 
reached this week involved the family of just one victim the other 
three settled about eight months ago walker said 
sydow was in court friday and unavailable to answer questions 
about the discrepancy an assistant said 
walker declined to give the amount of the settlement which he 
noted will actually be paid for continental by the airlines 
insurance company united states aviation insurance group of new 
york 
twentyeight people died and 54 were injured when the 
continental dc9 crashed while attempting to take off in a 
snowstorm at stapleton international airport on nov 15 1987 
the houstonbased carrier already has paid more than 20 million 
to settle 36 other crashrelated cases lawyers said 
the national transportation safety board ruled the crash was 
caused by a combination of weather factors and pilot errors 
the ntsb noted that the first officer who was at the controls 
and killed in the crash had little flight time on dc9s 
investigators also noted that the takeoff came 27 minutes after the 
jet was last deiced 
sydow said 45 million will go to mary cook of boise idaho 
and her daughter kay gosse mrs cooks husband richard cook 
died in the crash sydow said 
helen hideshima of denver will receive 25 million for the 
death of her husband mako hideshima byron owens of nyssa wash

archaeologists are uncovering more graves of freed 
slaves than they originally believed were beneath a city park in 
the path of a freewaywidening project 
officials originally believed freedmans cemetery contained less 
than 100 graves but new excavations prompted by the widening of 
dallas central expressway have uncovered about 1100 graves said 
archaeologist jerry henderson 
officials now estimate that more than 2000 slaves and freed 
slaves were buried in the cemetery which operated from 1861 to 
1925 the cemetery was largely forgotten and covered by the park 
and recently was rediscovered because of the freeway widening 
project 
the project threatens about 150 known graves but ms henderson 
said workers could find up to 800 graves that must be moved to make 
way for the new road 
scientists hope to catalog the vital statistics of 800 bodies 
before reburying them to learn more about the slaves lives said 
jerome rose chairman of the university of arkansas anthropology 
department 
i think it would ba a fantastic contribution to afroamerican 
history rose said

an art gallery and its director were acquitted 
friday of obscenity charges by a jury that rejected prosecution 
claims that sexually graphic photos by robert mapplethorpe lacked 
artistic value 
the twoweek obscenity trial was the nations first of an art 
gallery 
what a great day gallery director dennis barrie told 
reporters 
the jury of four men and four women returned the verdicts after 
slightly more than two hours 
barrie smiled slightly as a clerk read the verdict when the 
clerk finished barrie smiled broadly said all right turned 
in his chair and hugged his attorney h louis sirkin 
spectators in the hamilton county municipal court room shouted 
and applauded the jurors were ushered out of the courtroom 
judge david albanese expelled gallery board chairman roger ach 
and robert allen whose video production company sponsored the 
exhibit when they jumped out of their seats to hug barrie 
the jury cleared the contemporary art center and barrie of 
misdemeanor charges of pandering obscenity and using children in 
nudityrelated material barrie could have been sentenced to one 
year in jail and fined 2000 and the gallery fined 10000 if 
convicted on both counts 
obviously this is a very emotional moment its been a very 
hard time for me barrie said we did something very important 
for this city we stood up for the first amendment 
this is a major battle fought here today its a major battle 
for the arts and for freedom of expression in america 
however the rev donald e wildmon whose american family 
association in tupelo miss has fought national endowment for the 
arts funding for exhibits such as mapplethorpes said this is 
not a landmark pearl harbor decision this was just another 
obscenity trial 
i think this really puts the nea issue right back in the 
political arena where it belongs 
in closing arguments defense attorneys contended there was no 
basis for the charges of using children in nudityrelated material 
since the mothers of the children gave their consent the 
prosecution contended that consent was not in writing when the 
exhibit opened 
the defense also noted the us supreme courts threepronged 
test of obscenity material must appeal to a prurient interest in 
sex be patently offensive according to contemporary community 
standards and must lack redeeming artistic scientific or political 
value 
the jury has made its decision we accept it said frank 
prouty assistant city prosecutor 
during closing arguments prouty told jury members it was up to 
them to decide the artistic merit of the photographs 
are these van goghs these five pictures he asked 
a forearm rammed up a rectum thats art a finger stuck in 
the head of a penis is that art a canister or something 
stuck up your rectum is that art another picture where you have 
a man urinating into another mans mouth is that art 
the fifth photo is a selfportrait of mapplethorpe with a 
bullwhip in his rectum 
all five pictures think of it art prouty asked 
he told the jury to judge what they considered to be art using 
contemporary community standards not the standards of art experts 
who testified for the defense 
prouty recited the fable of the vain emperor who although 
naked believed he was fully clothed because his subjects praised 
his imaginary clothing 
the art world wants to tell you these are art and the 
townspeople sat there and watched the emperor walk down the street 
without any clothes on but yet all his advisers told him you have 
a beautiful coat because nobody wanted to come out and tell them 
that its not art 
you are the townspeople dont let somebody from outside come 
in and say it is art you say whether these five pictures are like 
the emperor without any clothes on 
sirkin barries attorney said the five photos no doubt 
offended some people but had serious artistic merit 
he quoted from a speech by john kennedy 
society must set the artist free to follow his vision 
wherever it takes him we must never forget that art is not a form 
of propaganda it is a form of truth the highest duty of the 
writer the composer the artist is to remain true to himself 
thats exactly what dennis barrie did sirkin said he 
wanted to share with this community a beauty that he felt was shown 
by an artist mr mapplethorpe 
sirkin reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in 
philadelphia chicago and berkeley calif without incident 
is cincinnati that different are we that childish are we not 
big enough to say we cant accept what other cities have seen 
sirkin asked 
defense experts have testified that mapplethorpe was an 
accomplished and respected photographer and that photographs of 
the children were morally and sexually innocent mapplethorpe died 
last year of aids at age 42 
the exhibit drew 81000 people during its sevenweek run last 
spring an attendance record for an art exhibit in cincinnati it 
closed friday in boston where 103000 tickets were sold 
attorney marc mezibov representing the gallery said the state 
failed to prove its case no presentation was made to back up the 
assertion that the photographs were not legitimate art 
have you thought why it is that no one for the state of ohio 
came in and testified that the exhibit had no serious artistic 
value dont you think that if there were people out there who 
thought that the state of ohio would have found them mezibov 
asked

this financially troubled city sued 
a judge who gave away city hall to pay a debt but the new owners 
lawyer says the propertys already been sold 
the suit filed friday in federal court seeks to reverse the 
sept 27 county circuit court ruling awarding city hall and some 
other city land to the guardians of a man who won a 34 million 
judgment after being injured in the city jail 
mayor carl officer contends in the 125 million lawsuit that the 
ruling by st clair county circuit judge roger scrivner was part of 
a pattern of racism against the predominantly black city the mayor 
also called for a us senate investigation of the circuit court 
the mayors suit filed in us district court on behalf of the 
people of east st louis alleged the circuit court has engaged 
in a pattern and practice of racially motivated conduct that has 
deprived the city of east st louis and its citizens of due process 
of law 
the mayor also asked the circuit court to reconsider scrivners 
decision and bar him from handling other cases involving the city 
said city attorney eric vickers 
scrivner awarded city hall and a piece of cityowned industrial 
property to walter debow 55 who suffered permanent brain damage 
after being beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city 
jail more than six years ago debow has no shortterm memory and is 
being cared for at a headinjury rehabilitation center in new 
jersey 
calls for comment to scrivner and the chief judge of the court 
werent returned friday 
debows attorney clyde kuehn said friday hed already made a 
deal to sell city hall he refused to name the prospective buyer or 
give the price 
kuehn said scrivners ruling was the only way to get the city to 
pay its debt to debow about 4 million because of interest 
the rights that were enforced in circuit court were the rights 
of a black man and a good guy too said attorney clyde kuehn 
referring to the allegation of racism you can win a 4 million 
verdict but you dont win until they pay 
debow who was in jail on charges of illegally transporting 
alcohol when the beating occurred needs the money to pay for his 
325perday care his family said 
the citys lawsuit seeks 25 million in actual damages and 100 
million in punitive damages 
the st clair county recorder of deeds said friday the property 
was placed in a trust oct 1 with eric rhein as guardian a phone 
call to rheins belleville law office was not immediately returned 
city hall is worth about 10 million vickers has said and city 
officials had been negotiating with a company to buy the other 
piece of property for 5 million to build a trash recycling plant 
east st louis is plagued by debt estimated at 47 million gov 
james r thompson signed a 34 million bailout bill aug 30 the 
money will come from state bond issues 
the population of the city which has one of the nations 
highest murder rates fell from 55000 in 1980 to 40000 this year 
the census bureau estimates 
selling the property rids debow of responsibility for paying 
property taxes which could be as high as 400000 annually on city 
hall alone kuehn said thursday 
it also eliminates potential liability for injuries on the 
property he said

a republican group agreed friday it will 
no longer use a controversial fundraising technique in alabama 
said the state attorney general and the gop organization 
alabama attorney general don siegelman said he will abandon a 
lawsuit against the republican presidential task force which 
mailed about 1 million fundraising letters nationwide in august 
and early september the task force is a fundraising program of 
the washingtonbased national republican senatorial campaign 
committee 
each threepage letter from the task force contained a 25 check 
and a threepage letter explaining that by depositing the check 
the recipient agreed to have 1250 a month automatically 
transferred to the republicans candidate support program 
the letters said a person could cancel after two months if not 
the withdrawals would continue the back of the 25 check 
reiterated the automatic withdrawal but siegelman said the print 
was so small one could hardly read it 
solicitations which could trick people into making involuntary 
contributions must not be tolerated siegelman said in a prepared 
statement 
the attorney general said he agreed to drop his lawsuit after 
receiving a commitment from the group not to send letters to 
alabama in the future 
in addition the group will send to each person who received the 
original letter another letter stating that monthly contributions 
of 1250 are being withdrawn from their bank accounts 
task force spokeswoman wendy burnley confirmed friday night that 
an agreement had been reached and that it applied only to the 
specific mailing made to alabama voters 
siegelman said the case began with a complaint from the daughter 
of a 76yearold hamilton woman who was prepared to deposit the 
check before her daughter examined it carefully 
burnley has acknowledged that the letter prompted complaints in 
at least six states state officials in new jersey and illinois 
have filed suit attorneys general of oregon minnesota and 
michigan have complained 
burnley said friday night that the group will have discussions 
with the attorneys general in oregon minnesota and michigan after 
the november elections 
she said the illinois suit is pending and that there will be a 
court proceeding next month in the new jersey suit

charles j donovan is running against 
republican lincoln chafee in the mayors race but the democrat 
seems to be taking on the entire chafee clan 
donovan a state senator ran an ad in the warwick beacon 
blasting not only chafee but the republicans father sen john 
chafee his brother assistant us attorney zechariah chafee and 
two of his cousins independent providence mayoral candidate fred 
lippitt and duncan h doolittle a former diprete administration 
official 
donovan criticized the chafees and their cousins for collecting 
state or federal pensions and working in what the democrat called 
patronage jobs 
the apple doesnt fall far from the family tree the ad 
said it pictured the heads of all five men as apples hanging from 
a tree 
a little desperate over there zechariah chafee said 
gosh said edward quinlan sen chafees spokesman fred 
lippitt is running for mayor of providence 
i wonder if hes forgotten where hes running said 
lippitts campaign manager richard white 
donovan stood by the ad but said he had no gripe with sen 
chafee 
i really do kind of like his father he said but issues 
are different than personalities 
lincoln chafee said the ad was incorrect because it implied that 
he receives a city pension for his service as councilman and that 
his brother gets a federal pension both said they were still 
ineligible 
sen chafee who will turn 68 this month started receiving a 
state pension of 6200 a year at age 60 after serving six years in 
the rhode island house and three terms as governor quinlan said 
the ad which ran thursday made no mention of donovans state 
pension donovan 52 receives 34271 after taking early 
retirement this year from his 20year job with the state school 
lunch program and a 4800 pension for his time in the

american dream an emotional uncompromising 
documentary of the hormel meatpackers strike in the mid1980s is 
very much hot off the presses 
it was completed the day before its screening thursday at the 
new york film festival and the director hopes the success of 
roger and me means theres an audience for her film too 
but it will be a tough sell for barbara kopple whose 1976 
movie harlan county usa won an academy award for best 
feature documentary american dream tells a bleak story with 
little of the irony and dark humor that made roger and me so 
entertaining despite its account of corporate greed and 
indifference in flint mich 
speaking at a press conference at the festival where the movie 
received an extended ovation kopple spoke of the years she spent 
in austin minn the location of the strike and her desire to 
gain national attention for the documentary 
i think roger and me is a film that takes a different look 
at the problems of working people and i enjoyed it very much 
said kopple whose other films include no nukes and civil 
rights the struggle continues 
i just want to follow in its footsteps she said 
the film begins in 1984 with geo a hormel amp co asking workers 
to accept wage cuts although the company was turning a profit 
hormel which said it needed the reductions to remain competitive 
had enjoyed good relations with workers over the years and several 
plants agreed to the concessions 
but austins local p9 of the united food and commercial workers 
decided to fight ray rogers a maverick consultant known for 
organizing jp stevens textile mills in the south was recruited 
and the union followed his policy of confrontation 
hormel would not back down and on aug 17 1985 the nearly 
1500 members of local p9 walked off their jobs the national 
union urged rogers and p9 president jim guyette to negotiate but 
they angrily refused and most of the workers supported them 
the strike dragged on for months and became increasingly bitter 
workers lashed out at hormel and fought with each other as the 
company filled their jobs with replacement workers some employees 
their strike fund cut off by the national union crossed the picket 
lines 
hormel eventually returned the plant to full capacity and most 
of the strikers never returned to work some remain in austin 
others looked for jobs elsewhere 
kopple had access to local and national union officials she 
shows meatpackers breaking down and crying and lifelong friendships 
being destroyed there is a brief moment of humor a closeup of a 
billboard reading enjoy austin where the good life is here to 
stay 
there was a lot of media there for the strike koppel said 
but im not a newsperson i have a much more personal style i 
wanted to get inside peoples heads im very sympathetic to 
peoples making decent wages and wanted to make an explanation of 
what happened

minister eduard shevardnadze at a ceremony attended by us

children who were attending an art workshop with soviet children in 
his native georgia

artillery fire that broke out overnight in the city outskirts had 
died down later friday 
french military officials in paris said its forces engaged in 
defensive fire early friday against armed men while tightening 
ranks around the french embassy 
the french soldiers were obliged to ripost in a purely 
defensive manner to armed elements the army press service 
said it said it was not known whether there were casualties 
the french defense ministry denied as absolutely false 
reports that its forces engaged in gunfire around the airport at 
kigali 
the scattered shooting in this impoverished country in central 
east africa marked the sixth day of unrest since the rebel force 
made up of rwandan refugees invaded from neighboring uganda 
diplomats from kigali a city of about 160000 residents said 
the french and belgian forces were helping rwandan forces maintain 
control of the capital 
the french defense ministry said its troops 150 sent friday in 
addition to 150 dispatched earlier were there only to protect 
french citizens and the diplomatic mission 
belgian defense minister guy coeme said four companies of 
paratropers or about 500 men arms and vehicles were being flown 
in 
coeme said the belgian troops would cntrol kigali airport and 
roads around it he declined to give more details

belgian troops had bolstered the morale of government troops in the 
mountainous nation the size of marlyand

their time of need tom martin a us embassy spokesman in 
kigali told cnn in a phone interview

said its made everybody feel a lot safer not just the belgian 
and french citizens who the troops were sent in to protect 
rwandan president juvenal habyarimana in an afternoon address 
broadcast nationwide said government forces were in full 
control of the situation 
according to martin the dissent is over the poor economic 
conditions of rwanda which has suffered from declining world 
prices for its main export crop coffee as well as food shortages 
and tribal conflict 
martin said support for the rebels appeared limited 
diplomats interviewed by telephone on condition of anonymity 
said it appeared no foreigners had been hurt in the unrest an 
estimated 250 americans are in the country of 67 million 
residents including tourists 
it looks like the french belgians and rwanda militias have 
things under control one diplomat said however the streets 
still are not safe 
there are an estimated 670 frenchmen in rwanda and radio france 
internationale said the french embassy was arranging for 200 
citizens to fly out of rwanda perhaps as early as friday night

rwanda would be evacuated on planes and others in truck and car 
convoys to neighboring burundi or zaire

the defense rested in the third sexfor 
spying trial of richard w miller without calling the former fbi 
agent to testify 
millers lawyer joel levine said he didnt put miller on the 
stand in us district court because he suffers from auditory 
dyslexia a condition that affects his verbal abilities in 
stressful situations 
judge robert m takasugi is hearing the case without a jury 
closing arguments were expected tuesday 
miller did not testify in his first trial which ended in a hung 
jury nor in his second trial which ended in him being sentenced 
to life in prison a federal appeals court overturned the 
conviction 
miller the only fbi agent ever charged with betraying his 
country did testify in pretrial hearings which takasugi will 
consider as evidence levine said 
the portly miller who had chronic money problems was arrested 
in 1984 and charged with passing documents to svetlana ogorodnikov 
in exchange for sex an overcoat and promises of 50000 in gold 
and 15000 in cash he was a member of the los angeles fbi office 
counterintelligence unit at the time 
levine said he would argue that millers auditory dyslexia makes 
his statements to fbi interrogators questionable 
ive told the truth and i always have miller said during a 
pretrial hearing i did not give anybody any documents 
levine also declined to call to the stand millers two alleged 
soviet contacts ms ogorodnikov and her husband nikolai 
ogorodnikov 
the couple pleaded guilty to espionage charges the husband has 
finished his prison term but the wife remains in prison 
earlier millers lawyers requested deportation of ogorodnikov 
be delayed so he could be called as a witness levine said friday

gotten the disease the department of veterans affairs announced

surgery at the salt lake va hospital may be referred to one of two 
other utah hospitals for the operation 
we want it made clear there wont be any delay should an organ 
become available he said

taking drugs to prevent organ rejection the drugs suppress the 
immune system making patients more to infection he said

tink badget of sheridan wyo was listed in critical 
condition following a transplant earlier this week 
officials withheld the name of the second patient 
badgets family said he was showing no signs of rejecting the 
new heart but that the lgionnaires infection was compromising his 
respiratory system 
legionnaires disease got its name from a 1976 outbreak at an 
american legion convention in philadelphia 
the sometimesfatal disease is caused by a common bacteria that 
grows in water including that in airconditioning ducts 
longley said the second patient suffered a mild infection and 
had recovered both from the illness and the transplant he was 
expected to be discharged over the weekend 
only two other va hospitals perform heart transplants in 
richmond va and chicago longley said

a renegade colonel who led a revolt 
on the philippines secondlargest island surrendered saturday 
ending the seventh military rebellion crushed during president 
corazon aquinos fouryear rule 
mrs aquino had refused to negotiate with the rebels and 
promised to crush them 
col alexander noble surrendered unconditionally at 3 am t 
sen aquilino pimentel on mindanao island said pimentel and 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa 
brig gen emiliano templo a military spokesman said nobles 
chief civilian ally reuben canoy had also been arrested canoy is 
leader of the mindanao independence movement and joined noble in 
proclaiming selfrule for the island 
pimentel said he would bring noble 42 to manila later saturday 
and turn him over to the military government troops were rounding 
up nobles followers group by group de villa said 
the small disruption in northern mindanao is over he said 
we have recovered the camps that they seized we are normalizing 
the conditions in these two cities 
there was no immediate comment from mrs aquino officials said 
she was notified shortly after noble gave up 
in cagayan de oro 500 miles south of manila a grimfaced noble 
claimed his objectives of drawing attention to problems of mindanao 
had been achieved 
at least the basic issues can be resolved peacefully noble 
told reporters its a good pattern for everyone for national 
reconciliation 
noble and his forces launched their rebellion early thursday 
seizing military camps in butuan and cagayan de oro and proclaiming 
independencefor mindanao 
de villa said nobles followers in butuan 70 miles east of 
cagayan de oro had surrendered the report could not be 
immediately confirmed 
de villa said noble and another renegade officer lt col 
victor erfe tried to slip out of camp evangelista headquarters of 
the 4th infantry division before dawn saturday but changed their 
minds and surrendered to pimentel 
local officials said noble gave up after several hours of 
negotiations 
about 2 am noble telephoned pimentel and said he was ready to 
surrender local reporters said pimentel sent a car to pick up 
noble and nobles troops then filed out twobytwo in civilian 
clothes witnesses said 
in manila col juanito rimando said about 150 of nobles troops 
had been taken into custody as of midmorning officials had 
estimated noble had about 300 troops and up to 600 civilians with 
him 
de villa said he had been contacted by the division commander 
brig gen miguel sol sol disappeared soon after the takeover and 
was temporarily relieved 
de villa quoted sol as saying he had escaped nobles troops 
and wanted to return to government control 
pimentel a former mayor of cagayan de oro flew to the city on 
friday to offer himself as a negotiator to end the crisis 
during a radio interview pimentel said he would accompany noble 
to manila later saturday and that the colonel would be handed over 
to military authorities 
they want me to continue their cause for mindanao which is 
for the national government to give enough attention pimentel 
said i dont see anything wrong with that 
military officials here suspected that nobles goal was not 
independence for mindanao but to create a diversion they suspected 
that noble wanted to force the government to deploy troops from 
manila 
military dissidents would then strike in the capital and try to 
topple the government 
troops were placed on full alert in manila and garrisons in the 
capital were reinforced but there was no sign of any unusual troop 
movements here 
it appeeared that noble gave up after realizing that his mutiny 
had not led to any general uprising on mindanao or in the manila 
area 
earlier friday about 150 elite scout rangers from the 23rd 
infantry battalion in the mindanao city of iligan had declared 
their allegiance to noble local journalists said the rangers 
joined the revolt because of an air raid thursday on their 
garrison 
military officials said government planes fired on the camp 
while attacking and destroying a rebel helicopter late friday the 
mutinous rangers left their camp and marched to the heart of 
iligan where they planned to camp overnight 
government forces did not attempt to stop them to avoid a 
firefight in the industrial center 
earlier in the day noble offered to negotiate with the aquino 
government and met later for about 90 minutes with local clerics 
mrs aquinos administration has come under increasing criticism 
for failure to provide basic services and to maintain law and 
order 
noble was formerly chief of staff of mrs aquinos guard force 
but he turned against her and joined a coup attempt last december 
he later fled to the jungles of northern mindanao where he 
organized a private army of higoanon tribesmen 
noble said he wanted talks with the moro national liberation 
front a moslem guerrilla group that has been waging a 20yearold 
struggle for selfrule mindanao is the home of the 5 million 
member moslem community in the philippines

a new analysis of the sexual behavior of 
dozens of men infected with the aids virus has implicated oral sex 
between men as a greater risk than many scientists had assumed 
the researchers looked at 82 men at three continuing san 
francisco bay area studies who tested positive for hiv the virus 
that causes aids of the 82 17 percent reported they engaged in 
oral sex and no other behavior that carries a high risk of catching 
aids 
oral sex was not implicated as a major risk factor in previous 
studies one of the primary researchers warren winkelstein said 
friday what this study does is show pretty clearly that it is a 
strong risk factor 
weve always pointed out that oral sex was a potential risk 
now weve confirmed it added winkelstein professor of 
epidemiology at the university of california at berkeleys school 
of public health 
kent taylor spokesman for the federal centers for disease 
control said the findings were important 
were looking for more information on the transmission by way 
of oral sex because not a lot has been documented in this area 
taylor said i would say this is a very interesting finding this 
is obviously a very difficult topic to research 
epidemiologist michael samuel who presented the analysis this 
week at the american public health association annual meeting in 
new york city said the men analyzed became infected between 1984 
and 1990 
more than half of the 82 men engaged in receptive and insertive 
anal intercourse and receptive and insertive oral sex according to 
the study 
thirtyfour percent didnt engage in anal receptive intercourse 
which is known to carry a high risk of aids transmission but 
did participate in at least one of the other three behaviors and 
17 percent of the infected men reported only oral intercourse 
either receptive or insertive 
samuel said that the infection risk also was elevated with the 
use of a douche or enema before anal intercourse countering a 
belief by some that such actions might decrease a chance of hiv 
infection 
the data also confirmed findings of others studies that the 
risk was unmistakably higher for those with two to four partners 
than for those with one partner 
the new findings do not address the risks of oral sex between 
men and women they also do not indicate how the aids virus was 
transmitted during the oral sex or to what extent condoms or any 
other protective measures could have prevented infection 
on oct 1 1989 the san francisco health department reported 
the first two documented cases in which men became infected with 
the aids virus through oral sex 
former surgeon general c everett kopp had warned four years 
before that oral sex might be a transmission path for the aids 
virus but at the time health authorities and parts of the gay 
community were debating the issue 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
as of august 146746 have been diagnosed with aids in the united 
states since reporting began in 1981 as of aug 31 89761 deaths 
had been recorded

here is a statement of president bush on the 
temporary budget resolution passed by congress friday night the 
statement was read by marlin fitzwater the presidents spokesman 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the hour of reckoning is at hand at midnight the congress of 
the united states must face up to the shutdown of government 
services and resulting confusion that will be strewn across this 
land because we could not produce a budget 
it is deeply discouraging that the governing bodies of this 
country would wrangle with the nations fiscal affairs for nearly a 
year and fail 
tonight because there is no budget the united states 
government under existing law does not have the authority to 
continue operations and i will not be a party to the process that 
would once again put off meeting its responsibilities for a few 
more days 
i will not sign the continuing resolution passed by the house 
and senate tonight which simply delays once again the most serious 
constitutional responsibilities of government to manage the 
peoples money 
at midnight tonight our national parks and monuments will close 
cleanup at hazardous waste sites will cease 
social security offices will accept no new applications 
border inspections will be delayed 
in one agency after another thousands of federal employees 
would no longer be able to serve public tasks necessary for the 
public good 
the people of america did not send their representatives to 
washington to produce these consequences 
as i said in my inaugural address they did not send us here to 
bicker and tonight i challenge the congress to act as quickly as 
possible to produce an acceptable budget 
dont wait for people to lose confidence in their government 
act now tomorrow as soon as possible to produce a budget that 
reduces the deficit avoids recession and puts our economy on the 
path of sustained growth 
i stand ready to work with the members of congress and to 
produce a responsible plan 
after months of hard work we produced a budget agreement that 
would have cut a real 500 billion dollars off out deficit over the 
next five years 
the white house and the congressional leadership of the 
democratic and republican parties worked hard to put together that 
agree and put in place the largest deficit reduction in history 
its a sad commentary that the full house did not have the 
courage of those convictions 
but surely the reality of a government closedown will convince 
everyone that a solution must be found 
it is time to act responsibly on this problem and produce a 
fiscal 1991 budget

earlier he said students might be open to compromise on their 
insistence that the 11 mayoral appointees to the universitys

not all if not immediately then soon thompson said 
the students will now propose a bill in the city council to

austria is searching for a new role in 
europe with the fall of the iron curtain and rise of a united 
germany but campaigning for parliamentary elections sunday has 
focused on domestic issues and mudslinging 
emerging populist and environmental parties could deal the worst 
blow to the main socialist and peoples parties since the 
republics formation in 1945 
the socialists in government since 1970 have been hurt by a 
series of corruption scandals several of their officials have 
tampered with public funds and alleged coverups from the past are 
now in the courts former socialist chancellor fred sinowatz was 
recently found guilty of perjury 
the conservative peoples party which joined the socialists in 
a coalition after the last elections in 1986 has suffered because 
its leadership is often perceived as weak 
the peoples party headed by vicechancellor josef riegler 
also still bears the burden of its support four years ago for 
president kurt waldheim who is accused of concealing his world war 
ii past waldheim is not a major issue in the campaign however 
the opposition parties stand to gain from the weakness of the 
governing coalition 
the rightleaning freedom party under populist leader joerg 
haider has garnered considerable support in recent years gaining 
strongly in regional elections haider 40 hopes to win more than 
20 percent of the vote in 1986 the freedom party won 97 percent 
of the vote for 18 of the 183 seats 
the greenalternative party holding eight seats in parliament 
hopes to double its mandate it has been among the most critical of 
haider with one green leader peter pilz calling haiders party a 
mixture of rightradical and populistopportunist 
the socialists now have 80 seats and the peoples party 77 
the socialists who in opinion polls are just ahead of the 
peoples party have categorically excluded coalition with haider 
who has relentlessly criticized the government 
some in the peoples party have hinted at a coalition with the 
freedom party if it draws votes away from the big parties riegler 
himself however has ruled out governing with haider 
according to pollsters an unusually high 25 percent of voters 
were undecided or determined not to vote about two weeks before the 
election 
with the governing parties on the defensive the campaign has 
been marked by mutual accusations and namecalling 
a peoples party poster with a photo of a yawning hippopotamus 
says mouthing off is not enough a reference to haiders 
repeated criticism 
haider turned the hippopotamus to advantage at a recent rally 
where would we be if we hadnt opened our mouths in the last 
four years haider asked an approving vienna crowd 
besides he said a hippopotamus has the ability to become 
extremely old and survive all others 
in a televised debate 10 days before the election socialist 
chancellor franz vranitzky and conservative leader riegler also 
exchanged barbs 
the socialist party campaigned heavily on the merits of 
vranitzky a charismatic 50yearold whose background in banking 
and performance as chancellor endear him to many austrians 
riegler scathingly compared the socialists to a store vendor 
saying dont look at my goods but i have a very attractive 
salesperson 
vranitzky charged riegler was unable to coordinate a clear line 
on major issues 
haider has struck more emotional chords 
a freedom party poster in the capital cries vienna must not 
become chicago a reference to rising crime that many austrians 
believe is perpetrated by immigrants 
the government last month imposed visa restrictions for poles 
and sent troops to the open border with hungary in an attempt to 
cut down on illegal immigration and black market labor 
haider has urged tougher measures since east europeans have been 
allowed to travel freely 
campaigning in vienna haider earned applause when he admonished 
eastern europeans what was valid for our parents and 
grandparents must also be valid in eastern europe in 1945 we also 
had nothing and had to work so work hard and build it up again 
while other parties have preferred to chart a new european 
course for austria after the elections haider has demanded an end 
to restrictions imposed on the country by the victorious allies in 
world war ii 
among those restrictions are arms sales and other trade with 
germany which under hitler had annexed an independent austria in 
1938

nasa workers loaded rocket fuel on 
space shuttle discovery friday preparing the craft for a saturday 
morning launch of the spacecraft carrying the nuclearpowered solar 
probe ulysses 
pumping more than half a million gallons of liquid hydrogen and 
oxygen into the fuel tank was a critical test of the shuttles 
rocket plumbing system fuel leaks earlier caused four launch 
scrubs in discoverys sister ships but officials said no leaks 
were immediately found friday night 
discovery was scheduled to lift off at 735 am saturday 
everything is going according to plan said nasa spokesman 
dick young 
earlier friday a judge rejected a petition by antinuclear 
activists who wanted to prevent nasa from launching the 
nuclearpowered ulysses the action in a washington federal court 
cleared the way for launch preparations to continue 
two demonstrators opposed to the radioactive cargo on discovery 
were arrested friday morning at the kennedy space center 
six hours after launch discoverys fiveman crew was scheduled 
to release ulysses from the shuttle cargo bay the probe is 
designed to rocket itself out of earth orbit for a roundabout 
voyage that eventually will enable it to study the unexplored polar 
regions of the sun 
young said discoverys mission would be unaffected by any 
government shutdown resulting from the federal budget dispute he 
said funds for the mission had already been set aside and notices 
had gone out that all employees were to report to work 
the mood of the team is confident and thats despite 
distractions and disappointments recently said launch director 
robert b sieck if the weather is good to us well have some 
good news on saturday 
for nasa the news has been mostly bad since the last successful 
shuttle launch in april the agency has scrubbed four shuttle 
launch attempts because of hydrogen fuel leaks and learned that 
there is a serious flaw in the hubble space telescope 
another problem was added to the list thursday when workers 
discovered that a 9foot 70pound metal beam had been left in the 
engine compartment of the shuttle atlantis 
when the craft was hoisted from a horizontal to a vertical 
position the beam clanked around inside the compartment causing 
up to 25 dents and dings none of the damage was believed serious 
sieck said and atlantis is still scheduled for a mission in 
november 
the beam is normally used to support a work platform used when 
the shuttle is being processed on the ground 
william lenoir boss of nasas spaceflight program said the 
problems are isolated incidents and not signs of the agencys 
decline 
i dont see a common thread that connects the hubble incident 
the hydrogen leaks and the beam lenoir said at a news 
conference 
a group of 20 demonstrators gathered at a restricted entrance to 
the space center friday morning and protested ulysses nuclear 
power supply they milled around the gate waving signs and calling 
to space center employees driving in to work 
two women from the group were taken into custody after they 
walked past a checkpoint into a restricted area they were charged 
with trespassing 
in washington dc a judge rejected a petition by three 
activist groups that sought to block discoverys launch with its 
nuclearpowered payload they asked for more research into the 
risks of the spread of radioactive materials should discovery 
explode during launch 
us district judge oliver gasch rejected the contention just 
as he did for a similar claim filed last year before the launch of 
galileo which also was nuclear powered 
ulysses is powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator 
or rtg which generates electricity from the heat of 237 pounds of 
highly radioactive plutonium the united states has used 22 rtgs on 
earlier space missions including five moon flights 
nasa says the plutonium is housed in a module that has been 
tested to withstand any probable accident the agency estimated 
that in the worst possible accident there is only a 1in44 
million chance of 145 cancer fatalities over 50 years 
after ulysses is released from discovery a twostage rocket 
will fire and send the europeanbuilt craft streaking toward 
jupiter ulysses will loop over jupiters north pole in 1992 and 
the giant planets intense gravity will give it a powerful burst of 
speed and hurl it back toward the suns south pole 
in 1994 ulysses will pass within 120 million miles of the suns 
south pole and about 18 months later it will pass over the solar 
north pole 
discoverys commander is richard n richards the pilot will be 
robert d cabana others in the crew are william m shepherd bruce 
melnick and thomas d akers

john schlesinger lately has been thinking a lot 
about alfred hitchcock 
actually he hasnt had much choice schlesingers latest film 
pacific heights is a psychological thriller with irresistible 
connections to the master of suspense himself questions are bound 
to arise 
based on a true story pacific heights stars melanie 
griffith and matthew modine as a young couple who purchase a large 
victorian house in san francisco and plan to rent rooms on the 
ground floor 
but they are nearly ruined when smoothtalking carter hayes 
michael keaton occupies one apartment and refuses to pay 
manipulating the legal system so griffith and modine end up on the 
wrong side of the law 
hitchcock would have loved it he specialized in making a little 
mayhem with ordinary lives turning an advertising executive 
into a fugitive in north by northwest and placing a dead body 
in a small new england town in the trouble with harry 
theres more schlesinger gave a minor role to tippi hedren 
griffiths mother and the star of two hitchcock films the 
birds and marnie he also makes a most hitchcocklike cameo 
schlesingers the heavyset man with a white beard riding the 
elevator with griffith in hitchcocks spellbound the 
director is seen leaving an elevator at the same time as gregory 
peck 
your defense mr schlesinger 
i havent made a study of his films in order to ape him 
said the director who has made some pretty fair movies himself 
including darling sunday bloody sunday and the academy 
awardwinning midnight cowboy 
but what hitchcock used to do quite often was take normal 
life yuppie life and from normalcy have something gradually creep 
up on you and as a child i saw the lady vanishes that wonderful 
film with dame may whitty and was haunted by the image of a 
bandaged head 
as far as the appearance i used to appear in all my films 
and then i said this is ridiculous hitchcock did this all the 
time so i stopped 
schlesinger fans will spot some of the directors own touches in 
pacific heights a sense of understatement an insistence that 
all ends remain loose and an everobservant camera that cases a 
room item by item like an electronic house detective 
i like the idea of using a camera to tell the story about 
people he said my doctor in london you can barely go sit in 
his consulting room because its filled with frogs little funny 
things hanging from the ceiling theres a scene in a lawyers 
office i thought why not make the lawyer collect frogs and 
introduce her with that image 
schlesinger born in london in 1926 was a character actor for 
stage film and televison and also made documentaries terminus 
won the golden lion for best documentary at the 1961 venice film 
festival 
the following year he established himself as one of englands 
finest young directors with a kind of loving and then made 
billy liar and darling for which julie christie won an 
academy award for best actress in 1965 he also managed to top 
hitchcock who never won an oscar by receiving one in 1969 for 
midnight cowboy 
his theory of directing life is doubleedged and movies should 
be too no schlesinger film ends with a couple walking 
handinhand into the sunset if it did hed probably make them 
escaped convicts or a guy with flowers arriving on top of a car 
as in a certain popular romantic comedy 
when i first heard about pretty woman i said ugh but 
its a very wellconfected film i had a good time 
if ive ever had any commercial success its been a total 
fluke i wouldnt have known midnight cowboy would have done so 
well 
schlesinger doesnt condemn pretty woman because hes also 
been guilty of relegating reality to a supporting role in 
marathon man a 1976 thriller with laurence olivier and dustin 
hoffman a vicious nazi olivier risks going to the jewish quarter 
in new york in search of diamonds 
great action schlesinger notes but unnecessary he didnt 
have to go to the jewish quarter to find about the diamonds 
and in the middle of pacific heights modine overhears 
keaton discussing his con game and has the incriminating evidence 
hes been hoping for but modine doesnt act on it and fails to 
tell police or his lawyer 
it would have ended the film laughed schlesinger who in 
his defense again summoned the spirit of poor mr hitchcock 
theres an expression applied to hitchcocks films called 
icebox logic icebox logic is as long as the film plays for the 
audience as theyre seeing it it doesnt matter if they go home 
and later when they open the fridge to get out the milk say to 
themselves now wait a moment why did they do this

you wouldnt be wrong if you thought todays 
tragedy is tomorrows tv movie producers commonly scour 
newspapers magazines and tv news shows seeking fare for 
factbased flicks 
whatever happened to what you might call fictionbased tv 
movies 
they exist but viewers are more interested in the other kind 
says producer steve tisch who has made both 
and selfishly networks are more interested in true stories 
its almost a joke but if they can say based on a true story 
they feel it gives them three or four more ratings points 
tisch should know he coproduced the burning bed a 1984 
nbc movie based on the true story involving wifebeating the 
fourth highestrated tv movie in history it got a 52 percent share 
of the audience 
now he has judgment another truestory dramatization 
premiering saturday on cables home box office its written and 
directed by tom topor a former new york reporter and author of the 
broadway drama nuts 
judgment is about a louisiana couple whose son was among a 
number of young boys sexually molested by their parish priest 
the real priest pleaded guilty to 11 criminal counts and was 
sentenced to 20 years in prison 
played by keith carradine and blythe danner the couple devout 
catholics refused the catholic churchs offer of a secret 
financial settlement that the other parents were willing to accept 
in the film the couple also wants the priest sent to prison 
the local district attorney balks explaining that a conviction is 
unlikely but he refers them to an old friend a veteran trial 
lawyer played by jack warden 
they sue the church accusing it of concealing information about 
the priests past history of child molestation 
as their attorney explains things he wins the civil case and 
then i take the transcript of the trial to the da he goes to 
trial he wins 
while factbased films may get the ratings they sometimes 
can backfire for a network if only in terms of the networks 
image 
case in point good night sweet wife a murder in boston a 
cbs movie that aired last month the movie dramatized a 
headlinemaking tragedy last year in which a pregnant woman carol 
stuart was shot dead her husband charles later apparently 
committed suicide 
the dead womans family sharply criticized cbs saying the film 
set a dangerous precedent that could sacrifice the privacy of 
other grieving families for the sake of profits 
such criticism is unlikely to happen with judgment for 
several reasons 
tischs previous tv films generally have drawn praise for their 
taste and responsibility and he said the couple depicted in 
judgment wanted their story told and enthusiastically allowed 
us to make the movie 
their one restriction their real names werent to be used 
unlike the families in the cbs movie the louisiana couple also 
was paid for rights to their story although tisch said they had no 
say in how the story was told he declined to say how much they 
were paid 
with factbased tv movies so rampant hollywoods producers 
may seem like the new version of ambulance chasers rushing minions 
to the scenes of nationally publicized crimes and tragedies to snap 
up the movie rights even before the victims tears dry 
but tisch didnt go after the story of the louisiana couple it 
was brought to him he said by a cbs news producer rob hershman 
the tv journalist had first done the story as a segment on cbs 
fastpaced nowdefunct west 57th series 
hershman who still works for cbs news is getting a 
coproducers credit on judgment 
tischs other efforts range from the successful tom cruise 
sleeper hit of 1983 risky business to abcs acclaimed but 
shortlived series call to glory to last years cbs bomb 
dirty dancing 
television movies have occupied a large part of his career but 
more are based on fiction than fact said tisch a nephew of cbs 
president laurence a tisch 
i would say that of the 14 or so television movies id done 
maybe four or five have been based on true stories he said 
yes they get ratings yes people are interested in watching

muzi is a zulu in alien 
territory a migrant in a settled township and needs no time to 
think when asked what he hates most about living in a workers 
hostel 
everything is bad he said theres no privacy even in 
the toilets nothings being done 
he sat on one of four beds in a dark concreteblock room beneath 
a roof of corrugated metal a stocky bearded man with his arms 
wrapped across his chest grease and dirt stained the floor and 
walls a lone electric wire stretched overhead 
staying here you end up drinking muzi said im so tired 
of waiting 
the squalid hostels long a source of many social ills have 
become flash points of political violence that has killed nearly 
800 blacks in townships around johannesburg since aug 12 
many of the vicious street clashes have pitted hostel dwellers 
usually zulus like muzi against township residents from other 
tribes 
most of the zulus support the conservative inkatha movement 
based in their homeland in natal province and many township 
residents support the african national congress 
even south africas white government architect of the apartheid 
system that spawned the hostels has called for change president 
fw de klerk visited a soweto hostel in september and standing in 
a urinestained hall said the conditions were unacceptable 
officials have suggested converting some hostels to family 
dwellings but no action has been taken 
more than 130 hostels housing nearly 200000 people dot the 31 
black townships around johannesburg 
muzi who is 32 and has two children is one of countless blacks 
who for decades have left their families in impoverished rural 
areas to seek work in johannesburg the financial hub of south 
africa he would not reveal his last name 
apartheid laws made the move difficult requiring a migrant to 
obtain a job first in order to live in an urban township most 
restrictions were repealed in the 1980s but overcrowding in the 
townships has left migrant workers little choice but to live in the 
cramped singlesex dormitories without heat or indoor plumbing 
miserable living conditions combined with tribal and political 
rivalries encourage fighting 
the evil migrant labor system lies at the root of the 
current conflict said a group of national church leaders 
including desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop who won the 
1984 nobel peace prize 
other observers say its more complicated 
john kaneberman head of the respected institute of race 
relations a private organization said personal disputes 
political and tribal differences human nature and poor living 
conditions contribute to the violence 
its a lot of different factors and one might not be aware of 
them he said 
for example rooms in many hostels are segregated by tribe if a 
man has a fight with someone from another room and his friends get 
involved he said a personal dispute has the appearance of tribal 
fighting 
he insisted that tribal differences play a role despite 
statements to the contrary by black leaders 
its not fashionable in liberal circles to talk about black 
ethnic rivalry because the government used that argument as part of 
its divisive strategy he said 
kaneberman said township residents look down on the poorly 
educated rural workers creating class differences and the 
frustration and danger of hostel life compound the problems 
more than 5000 people live in some hostels like jabulani and 
merafe in soweto residents pay monthly rent of about 6 for a bed 
in a room that usually is shared by with at least three others 
many turn to prostitutes alcohol and drugs while away from 
their families 
the compounds are a social disaster not only in terms of 
separating breadwinners from families but in terms of the 
psychological strains placed on the workers in them jerry 
majatladi spokesman for the national union of mineworkers told 
the star newspaper

an immense difference exists between the 
techniques and procedures for cutting expenses in private industry 
and cutting them in government 
the products and services are different of course and the 
method of doing business is too while the private sector is 
profitseeking the government is a notforprofit organization and 
it almost always achieves that goal 
but there is an even vaster difference one that involves the 
recognition of reality governent budget cutters tend to shirk from 
the task even to evade or fudge the issues should a business do 
that it would go bankrupt 
businesses have indeed gone under after futile attempts to hide 
from the realities in the end the bottom line always catches up 
to them the banks shut them off creditors bring them to court and 
mete out the remains 
governments arent like that they persist some third world 
nations owe more money than they can count and the same might even 
be said about the us government some budget agreement 
numbers had a strange appearance 
the budget cut package assumed for example that longterm 
interest rates might fall to 53 percent a level unseen since 
1967 and that shortterm rates might decline to 42 percent which 
would be a post1972 record low 
questionable assumptions also were made about economic growth 
that the rate would nearly double over the next year and exceed 
even that pace in 1991 and 1992 considering taxes would be higher 
that scenario was suspect 
some of the devices used in cutting government budgets could 
never exist in the private sector such as tossing certain expenses 
off the books throwing them off budget business could never 
get away with writing off a creditor 
neither could the management of a business ever convince 
shareholders and directors that it was really cutting to the bone 
when it was merely cutting the rate of previous spending 
projections the budget summitteers did that 
businesses all over the country are cutting these days some are 
doing so because they fear a recession is under way and might get 
worse and others such as chase manhattan bank are cutting simply 
to exist the choices for privatesector firms are painful but 
unavoidable they must close plants and lay off workers 
some companies in fact are choosing to shrink themselves on a 
more permanent basis they are abandoning product lines and selling 
off divisions retreating to their basic core of expertise back 
to their original self 
government could never do this its customers simply would never 
let it happen should it make the attempt its elected officials 
and directors would lose their jobs as quickly as voters could make 
their way to the polls 
in short the marketplace makes business relatively honest the 
bottom line is an impartial disciplinarian one that doesnt 
forgive and seldom tolerates excuses while it has been known to 
miss some crooks and charlatans usually it steps right in and 
slaps down fuzzy thinkers and financial tinkerers 
yes it can be bent through creative accounting and tax 
loopholes but compared to political accounting it is inflexible 
it is where the buck stops and that seems not to be the way of 
politics 
a publicsector official therefore might find anything like a 
bottom line an intolerable intrusion a dangerous presence an 
infringement on style to be enacted out of existence

francia martinez stood 
in line for rice beans and flour she wanted sugar too but knew 
there would be none of that sweet staple 
sugar the foundation of this caribbean nations economy for 400 
years is gone from store shelves it is being shipped to foreign 
buyers who pay more than dominicans can afford 
nobody understands whats going on in this country said 
freddy sanchez waiting in a nearby gas station line that was four 
blocks long prices go up but were still short 
mrs martinez taking shelter from the midday sun under a black 
umbrella said she was lacking everything at home for her 
husband and three children 
rising consumer prices and shortages of gasoline food 
electricity even water are causing hardships and widespread 
protest among the dominican republics 7 million people 
two nationwide protest strikes since august have led to violence 
between security forces and demonstrators in which at least 14 
people have been killed and 90 wounded police report 2300 
arrests but strike leaders say the number is higher 
a few days before a strike in september three santo domingo 
university students were killed by the explosion of a bomb they 
were making on campus police found an arsenal of explosives in 
santiago the secondlargest city 
protest began when president joaquin balaguer imposed economic 
austerity shortly before beginning his second consecutive fouryear 
term in august 
he ended subsidies for such basic goods as flour cooking oil 
and gasoline causing prices to triple in some cases gasoline has 
risen since august from 55 cents a gallon to 142 with added help 
from the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
balaguers government could not afford the normal level of oil 
imports after the persian gulf crisis drove world prices up so it 
began importing about onethird less and rationed gasoline 
theres no flour sugar gas medicine because the country has 
no dollars no foreign currency no reserves said andres 
dauhakre a leading economist certainly the crisis in the middle 
east doesnt help 
economic problems have mounted since world sugar prices 
collapsed and us import quotas were cut in the 1980s last years 
crop was smaller than usual 
the dominican republic which shares the island of hispaniola 
with haiti has a foreign debt of 41 billion by conservative 
estimates 28 percent of its workers are jobless and annual 
inflation is 70 percent 
a 500 million building spree largely tied to the 500th 
anniversary in 1992 of columbus discovery of america has created 
schools roads housing irrigation dams and monuments but the 
government has financed it by the inflationary means of printing 
money 
power plants have deteriorated from neglect causing blackouts 
of up to 18 hours a day many homes and factories have their 
generators but fuel shortages make them unreliable breakdowns of 
electric pumps cause water shortages 
the international monetary fund demanded the austerity measures 
balaguer 84 and blind from glaucoma says they are necessary and 
has urged dominicans to conserve 
we have to use less gas go out less go to the beach less 
he said recently we must appeal to dominican patriotism so that 
we can overcome this crisis 
there is no current agreement with the imf because the country 
could not pay interest on most of its debt in the past year it is 
ineligible for loans and has no credit 
talks with the imf are under way but dominicans are wary the 
last imf program in 1984 led to higher prices and riots that took 
100 lives 
tourism the really bright prospect is expected to net 1 
billion this year but visitors may start choosing islands with 
fewer problems 
officials blame the unrest on supporters of leftist former 
president juan bosch 81 whom balaguer defeated by 1 percent of 
te vote in may 
jose luis arteaga balaguers economic adviser said the 
opposition thinks the balaguer government is illegitimate because 
of the elections they want to make life impossible for us 
bosch accused balaguer his longtime political foe of 
widespread vote fraud but an independent electoral board said a 
lengthy review of voting tallies produced no evidence 
balaguers narrow victory deprived his conservative social 
christian reformist party of a congressional majority and critics 
accuse him of ruling by decree 
to soften the the austerity measures the government gave public 
employees a 30 percent pay raise and froze some prices the freezes 
have led to speculative buying creating further shortages 
unions demand a 150 percent general raise the minimum wage now 
is equivalent to 72 a month

the womens rights organization khalida 
massaoudi leads is the largest in this moslem nation 400 members 
in a total population of 26 million 
ms massaoudi 32 worries that the shift to democracy will do 
nothing to end tyranny for algerian women her fears deepen with 
each political advance by the fundamentalist islamic salvation 
front known as the fis 
the biggest danger for us is if the fis take power said the 
softspoken teacher of high school mathematics it will prolong 
the totalitarianism algeria has already known too long 
she said the marxist revolutionaries who ruled algeria 
unchallenged for 28 years had given the fundamentalists a 
readymade framework for oppressing women under islamic law 
the national liberation front or fln imposed oneparty rule on 
algeria after winning independence from france in 1962 many fln 
leaders were devout moslems despite their marxist phisosophy and 
wrote into the constitution that algeria would be an islamic 
nation 
ms massaoudi said each member of her independent association 
for the triumph of womens rights is a heroine in a society that 
has never made a gift to women 
for the crushing majority of women in this country the only 
world is the family she said 
although barely 5 feet tall ms massaoudi stands out in her 
workingclass neighborhood she holds a job lives alone leaves 
her red hair uncovered and asks no mans permission to go out 
algerias work force of 8 million includes only 380000 women 
most of the rights leaders female neighbors cover themselves 
with long robes and scarves before leaving their houses and nearly 
always are accompanied by another woman or a male relative 
women served in the national liberation front during the 
eightyear guerrilla war and islamic tradition coexisted uneasily 
with western concepts of womens rights during the first generation 
of independence 
women in algiers and oran wore skirts and trousers but most 
rural women concealed themselves behind veils 
divided as it was between devout moslems from rural areas and 
more secular leaders from the cities the fln sidestepped the issue 
of womens rights 
then in 1984 the national assembly passed the family law in 
response to pressure from islamic fundamentalists it was reformist 
in theory restricting polygamy giving women a say in educating 
their sons after age 10 and allowing women to initiate divorce 
proceedings 
in practice according to ms massaoudi law codified 
secondclass status for women 
one of its victims was a woman who would identify herself only 
as keltoum 
her husband declared them divorced in january and threw keltoum 
31 and their five children out of the house 
he didnt need a court ruling under islamic tradition 
guaranteed by the family law keltoums husband divorced her simply 
by telling her the marriage was over 
had keltoum sought a divorce she would have had to prove in 
court that he had committed adultery or had not wanted children 
i cant imagine saying such things before a judge she said 
no algerian woman could 
an electoral code passed in 1986 allows husbands to cast their 
wives votes which contributed to the sweeping municipal and 
regional election victory by fundamentalists in june 
that law was the final stab in the back by the fln ms 
massaoudi said the fln dug the grave for women and put them in 
it 
the fln has a womens wing as do other parties but they remain 
under the control of male hierarchies 
president chadli bendjedid has proposed reforming the election 
law but the fundamentalist islamic salvation front accuses him of 
bending the rules to help the fln 
with solid support among algerias swollen ranks of unemployed 
young men the fundamentalists have the strongest party as the 
spring parliamentary elections approach 
most followers of the fundamentalist party favor separate 
education for males and females 
the woman is sacred said dilinjer boualem 55 we want 
them to learn to do medicine as the islamic law says but 
mixing this we are against it is forbidden for moslem people 
on rights to work they are more vague an article in the 
salvation fronts newspapr said women should work when necessity 
arises 
the woman who goes to work and preserves her honor modesty 
and purity who honorably fulfills her task then comes home as 
clean as she left should not in our humble opinion be 
considered as having disobeyed the commandments of god it said 
one test of modesty is whether a woman wears the hijab a scarf 
covering the head and neck increasing numbers of women even in 
algiers are doing so because of religious conviction social 
pressure or reasons of fashion 
others refuse even those who will not speak to a western 
journalist without permission from a male relative 
rhodia belkacem a 21yearold secretary who binds her long 
black hair with gold combs said i could never go out in a 
hijab nobodys threatened me but ill never wear it even if they 
kill me

the news isnt all bad for stockmarket 
investors these days 
just consider the bumper crop of potential capitalloss tax 
writeoffs the market decline of 1990 has produced 
as a note of cheery reassurance that may have a hollow ring 
but a good many stock traders will be thinking along precisely 
those lines through the remainder of the year seeking a chance to 
shift some of the burden of their ill fortune onto the shoulders of 
uncle sam 
the basic rule they follow is that losses on financial 
investments not just stocks but also other securities like bonds 
and mutualfund shares can be deducted within limits against 
income when you fill out your tax return 
first a loss realized on a security sold during the year is 
used dollar for dollar to offset any capital gain you might have 
realized such as on the sale of a stock 
if you have losses that exceed your investment gains they can 
normally be deducted against your other income up to a limit of 
3000 net losses of more than 3000 can be carried forward 
indefinitely to future years 
hence the annual exercise known on wall street as tax 
selling in which investors juggle their portfolios to minimize 
the amounts they will owe the government 
a generation ago tax selling often was cited as a primary force 
behind the markets fluctuations in the closing weeks of a year in 
recent years it has drawn less attention 
that is partly due analysts say to the increasing dominance in 
the marketplace of investing institutions such as pension funds 
that are exempt from current taxation 
in addition there have been relatively few losses for investors 
to consider taking in most years of late thanks to the mighty bull 
market of the 1980s even in 1987 when the market crashed in 
october stocks wound up the year about where they started 
not so in 1990 through the first three quarters of the year the 
dow jones industrial average was down about 11 percent and some 
broader market measures showed losses twice that size 
thus many observers believe tax selling could put some extra 
pressure between now and mid to late december on stocks such as 
the depressed bank issues and small growth companies that have 
been particularly poor performers to date 
in their dealings with individual investors who are considering 
selling a losing investment to get the tax benefits brokers 
generally advise them to act early and avoid the december rush 
what if an investor wants to take a tax loss but also wishes to 
keep his or her position in a stock expecting better times ahead 
to avoid a wash sale that invalidates any tax loss you 
cannot sell the stock and buy it back within any 30day period 
of course selling in say midnovember and buying a stock back 
31 days later exposes you to the risk of missing a sudden rally in 
the interim 
an alternative strategy is to double up buying an 
additional lot of the security first and selling the old investment 
at least 31 days later 
although this will enable you to maintain your original 
investment position it will also double your risk for at least 31 
days points out the consumer reports annual guide to income tax 
preparation 
your decision should be based primarily on whether you want to 
own the stock not on some perceived tax benefit that increases 
your risk otherwise if the stock continues to drop you have 
simply increased your loss

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says he 
would oppose any attempt to increase his departments share of 
budget cuts but farm leaders say that isnt enough 
they are predicting that the 13 billion in cuts included in the 
deficitreduction package rejected by the house last thursday would 
send the farm economy into a tailspin 
it was not immediately clear if any new budget agreement would 
make further cuts in the usda budget 
all of the 13 billion would have come out of commodity credit 
corp operations 
the ccc is synonymous with commodity price supports the arcane 
and expensive world of acreage reduction loan rates target prices 
and deficiency payments 
plainly the budget plan would have cut federal subsidies to 
farmers a major portion of annual income over many years 
although declining from a peak of 167 billion in 1987 those 
direct payments are expected to be around 9 billion this calendar 
year 
the american farm bureau federation sounded a complaint common 
among agriculture leaders farm programs it said account for less 
than 1 percent of the federal budget yet the agreement requires 
those to absorb 10 percent of the total federal reduction 
dean kleckner federation president also cited tax increases 
that he said would hurt agriculture 
the proposed tax increases threaten to harm an already shaky 
economy he said that in itself is bad for agriculture but 
the provisions affecting agriculture make matters worse 
among the proposed tax hikes was an increase of 12 cents per 
gallon on fuels which kleckner said would hurt rural people 
because they drive greater distances for services and have no 
public transportation alternatives 
david senter of the american agriculture movement said in 
effect farmers are going to lose a major part of their income due 
to this budget agreement 
other factors add to the impact of budget cutting on farmers 
said leland swenson president of the national farmers union grain 
prices are depressed and operating costs are rising because of the 
mideast crisis and soaring prices of crude oil 
the 13 billion slash in usda programs would throw the farm 
sector into a tailspin financially he said 
even yeutter who endorsed the package adopted by budget 
negotiators recognized that the cuts would squeeze agriculture 
hard and that there would have to be a lot of belttightening 
yeutter said the house defeat of the plan on thursday night made 
usda programs even more vulnerable to cuts than before he said 
the house vote was a betrayal of political responsibility to do 
something about the deficit 
i will strongly resist any efforts to cut agricultural 
expenditures further in any future budget agreements he said 
an irony in all this is the general improvement in the financial 
health of us agriculture in the last few years 
yeutter in a sept 24 letter to sen patrick leahy dvt 
chairman of the senate agriculture committee said the expiring 
1985 farm law helped the farm sector rebound from the doldrums of 
the early 1980s 
farm equity or net worth bottomed out at 552 billion in 1986 
he said its now estimated at 688 billion which he called a 
truly spectacular improvement of 136 billion in four years 
yeutter said farm debt which peaked at 193 billion in 1982 
has been clipped to 127 billion in eight years 
that puts american agriculture in a much better position to 
deal with the economic shocks of the coming decade including the 
ones weve felt in recent weeks he said 
the purpose of yeutters letter to leahy was to note the 
challenges ahead and urge the chairman to design farm legislation 
accordingly as senate and house conferees work out compromises 
for the 1990 farm bill 
meanwhile usda economists are trying to decipher what may 
happen to farm income in 1991 after being at record or nearrecord 
levels since 1985 
one measure favored by the economists is net cash income the 
amount left over after paying cash expenses during a calendar year 
in 1990 says the departments economic research service this 
could be a record in the range of 59 billion to 63 billion 
but 1990 farm income will not bear the brunt of the recent jump 
in energy costs prompted by the mideast crisis not only gasoline 
and diesel but petroleumbased fertilizers and other agricultural 
chemicals will be hit 
couple those effects with whatever congress decides about 
cutting farm subsidies and 1991 and probably the presidential 
election year of 1992 will shape up as extremely tricky for 
economists peering into crystal balls 
a major upturn in exports could go a long way to ease the 
financial crunch on farmers pushing up market prices and creating 
demands for greater production 
but if that happens it wont be quick at the moment usda 
forecasters are still working on 1991 export projections 
a hint of what may happen was included in the october issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine however it said that both the value 
and the volume of us commodity exports are expected to decline

latches bibs to cribs its in a close race with fisher price as 
the leader in items for infants and toddlers 
the number of products under the playskool name has more than 
tripled since 1983 said bob stebenne president of playskool baby 
the division that deals with articles other than toys playskool 
baby will put more than 30 million products on the market this 
year he said 
playskool still makes a complete line of baby toys including 
raggedy ann dolls gumby lincoln logs and mr potato head 
its 1991 line will include a 33 collapsible baby carrier for 
parents on the go a 5 snack dispenser that resembles a bird 
feeder and a versatile clothing line that grows with the child 
through a system of fasteners 
we are honestly the most diversified company out there when it 
comes to what we do stebenne said though fisher price disputes 
that claim 
the change at playskool started about six years ago after toy 
maker hasbro inc based in pawtucket ri acquired playskool 
with its takeover of milton bradley by then hasbro already owned 
glenco infant items and its tommee tippee line 
we changed that whole product range from glenco to playskool 
because we knew we had a lot of equity in that playskool name 
stebenne said in a telephone interview from dallas where he was 
preparing for the thursday opening of the annual juvenile products 
manufacturers association convention 
through the rest of the decade playskool continued to expand 
it purchased child guidance from cbs toys the pur line of infant 
feeding and care products and introduced a line of medical products 
for daily health care needs 
last year hasbro started licensing the playskool name to 
companies that make humidifiers tape recorders and other types of 
electronic equipment 
i think the marketing concept quite honestly was how can we 
strengthen the playskool brand name and the way to do it was 
introduce it to new moms both prenatally and postnatally said 
stebenne 
an estimated 41 million babies will be born in the united 
states this year which gives playskool and its competitors an 
enormous opportunity to promote their items playskool baby is 
planning to give new parents about 22 million complimentary baby 
baskets which include coupons and free products 
overall playskool baby estimates it will reach 70 percent to 80 
percent of new parents through various marketing strategies 
stebenne said 
i think all companies are looking to broaden their product 
offerings i think playskool just saw a number of niche 
opportunities and went after them said industry analyst gary 
jacobson of kidder peabody amp co in new york 
bob mann executive vice president of playskool said he 
believes the company took the lead in the infant toy market last 
year from the fisher price division of quaker oats co 
but strawn cathcart fisher price vice president of marketing 
says his company still leads that market although it does not 
offer medical products or safety items like outlet covers and 
cabinet latches 
we do a lot more than playskool does cathcart said 
playskool does not except through licensing compete in the 
juvenile business 
still industry analysts say fisher price has faltered recently 
allowing playskool to gain an advantage 
john mcmillin a fisher price analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york said that company faltered by 
introducing too many expensive items that arent selling well the 
result is that fisher price likely will only break even this year 
after a decade of growth 
we did introduce a number of high price products that proved 
to be less than successful in the marketplace and weve taken care 
of those problems cathcart said but it does not for a minute 
mean that we were taking our eyes off the infant and juvenile 
area

real estate manager lynn mooney whose turf 
is the retirement community of sun city center usually has her 
hands full with retirees looking for a good buy but this year is 
different 
snowbirds as the refugees from colder climes are known are 
having trouble unloading their homes so for now at least theyre 
staying with the snow 
with the real estate market so bad up north right now its 
harder for them to just sell their homes and come down here they 
have to wait mooney said 
and that economists say is hurting floridas construction 
business and unemployment rate which at 67 percent is outpacing 
the nations 56 percent 
were seeing the same kind of ripple effect in just about 
every state where retirees from the northeast tend to settle 
said robert villanueva economic forecaster for the national 
association of home builders 
he added that new housing starts in florida have dropped 18 
percent in california 19 percent 
in the past retirees would come to sun city center and plunk 
down up to 300000 for a new home money they dont have now ms 
mooney said 
and some who do come are forced to take out mortgages or forgo 
their dreams of a retirement home in favor of renting or moving 
into a condominium which also adds to the slump in new 
construction 
construction unemployment took the biggest bite out of the 
states 55 millionperson workforce according to august figures 
from the florida dpartment of labor 
unemployment in construction rose nearly 5 percent in the past 
year accounting for 15900 jobs depository institutions lost 
6000 jobs in the same period and manufacturing 5000 
while floridas unemployment is high none of the blame can go 
to its biggest industry tourism employment in the service 
sector which includes hotels and amusement parks grew nearly 7 
percent in the past year picking up 105000 new jobs 
its hard to pin unemployment on one thing said becky rust 
an economist with floridas labor market information bureau in 
tallahassee high interest rates expectations of a recession and 
a continually growing population dont help at all 
economists say those factors will also help to keep the states 
construction and related employment in the dumps for years 
villanueva predicts new home starts in florida wont begin to 
recover until at least the middle of the decade with a slowdown in 
the influx of retirees a factor 
demographer stephen golant of the university of florida said 
economics wont be the only reason for the retiree slowdown in a 
recent study he predicted the drop will continue through the 1990s 
as the population of the 6574 age group shrinks in the nations 
colder climes 
between 199o and 2000 he predicts an 8 percent drop in the 
number of elderly migrating to florida from the northeast and 
midwest 
the 1980 census showed that as migration peaked in the late 
1970s more than 80000 people over age 60 were moving to florida 
annually

skepticism about the proposed worker buyout of 
ual corp is returning even as united airlines employees move 
closer to getting bank financing for a bid 
analysts said a sharp drop in uals stock price thursday 
reflected investor doubts that uals board will accept the employee 
offer which is expected to value the airline company at 165 to 
175 per share or 36 billion to 38 billion 
the board accepted a bid from the group of 201pershare or 
44 billion in april 
the buyout group is racing to meet a tuesday deadline imposed by 
the board to put together financing for the deal 
samuel buttrick airline analyst with kidder peabody and co 
said that when the board gave the employees a twomonth extension 
on aug 9 the board made it clear that they would be hard 
pressed to accept any offer that was not commensurate in value 
with the 201 per share bid 
are they going to take a 175 deal they are under no mandate 
to do so said painewebber inc analyst edward starkman 
ual stock fell 637 to 10537 a share thursday on the new 
york stock exchange 
the stock had risen earlier in the day after a dutch bank agreed 
to join four us banks in each loaning the workers 350 million 
about 20 other banks were to have responded by thursday to 
requests to participate in the deal which requires at least 2 
billion in bank financing 
one person familiar with the transaction who spoke on condition 
of anonymity said the four lead banks would not decide until at 
least friday whether the other banks had offered enough loan money 
in addition to the 175 billion already committed to keep the 
deal alive 
the new york times quoted unidentified sources thursday as 
saying bank financing was assured but the employee group still 
lacked 1 billion in financial commitments from nonbank sources 
the dutch bank nmb postbank groep nv agreed to contribute 350 
million in financing for the employee bid said greg flynn 
vicepresident for corporate finance in a telephone interview from 
new york 
nmb was the first foreign bank to commit funds to the deal and 
the first major lending institution to line up behind the four lead 
banks bankers trust new york corp manufacturers hanover corp 
security pacific corp and first chicago corp 
the lead banks agreement was contingent on the participation of 
other banks most of them foreign to complete the loan package a 
source told the associated press 
the source said the lead banks wanted the total amount of bank 
financing commitments to be well in excess of the 2 billion 
that the buyout group needs

the head of the securities and exchange 
commission says he will impose securities rules on banks if another 
federal regulator lets them advertise a type of trust fund that 
could put them in competition with the trillion dollar mutual fund 
industry 
the office of the comptroller of the currency says thats okay 
but notes that banks are exempt from certain sec regulations 
but the mutual fund industry is opposed to allowing banks to 
advertise the trust funds will put investors at risk while giving 
banks an unfair advantage over the more heavily regulated mutual 
funds 
supporters and opponents of the proposed rule change aired their 
views thursday before the finance subcommittee of the house energy 
and commerce committee which oversees both the sec and mutual 
funds 
under the proposed change the comptroller of the currency 
which regulates 4000 national banks around the country wants to 
allow banks to advertise collective investment funds separately 
from their other services 
bank trust departments are allowed to combine individual trusts 
like those maintained for wealthy widows and minors into 
collective funds for administrative purposes 
the comptrollers office wants to lift a ban preventing banks 
from advertising the availability and performance of those combined 
funds in effect letting them be marketed as ersatz mutual funds 
mutual funds small banks and some members of congress have 
criticized the proposal as risky after the savings and loan debacle 
and reports of underfunding of the federal deposit insurance corp 
which guarantees bank deposits 
there also is concern that financial products sold in banks will 
give customers the impression they are federally insured which 
they are not that was a problem arising out of the failure of 
lincoln savings and loan where some investors lost their life 
savings in securities sold at the thrift 
without appropriate safeguards in place the potential for 
investor confusion is substantial rep edward j markey 
dmass said at a hearing before the finance subcommittee of the 
house energy and commerce committee markey is chairman of the 
panel 
but robert l clarke the comptroller of the currency said that 
while the negative reaction is large the issue is small 
the revisions we are contemplating would not expand bank 
powers clarke said he said banks already are permitted to 
advertise the service along with others but not separately 
the government doesnt tell supermarkets that they cannot 
advertise carrots unless they advertise all the other vegetables in 
the produce section he said why then should the government 
keep banks from advertising common trust funds services separately 
from other trust services 
markey suggested that since congress is troubleshooting the 
countrys banking laws the comptrollers office should wait to 
implement the change until the bush administration presents its 
opinion 
clarke said afterward that he had no timetable for making a 
decision 
supporters of the proposed change testifying thursday included 
wells fargo banks william e aldinger iii speaking for the 
coalition of regional banks and richard w heiss of the 
manufacturers national bank of detroit representing the american 
bankers association 
opponents included david manning of the community bankers 
association of illinois and peggy miller of the consumer federation 
of america 
the sec doesnt oppose the change but sec chairman richard c 
breeden told the panel it would impose its own regulations on banks 
if they are allowed to market their collective trust funds 
but clarke noted that banks are exempt from two of the four laws 
that govern mutual funds 
therefore the sec would be unable to regulate the sales 
practices of banks vending funds as it now can for mutual fund 
salesmen that would deny investors the protection of those laws 
breeden said in our view the commission believes these 
statutory exemptions for banks are no longer appropriate he 
said 
david silver president of the investment company institute 
which represents the mutual fund industry said these loopholes 
leave serious gaps for investor protection 
he said the industry doesnt oppose bank entry into the mutual 
fund business as long as appropriate investor safeguards and equal 
regulation are in place 
silver also warned that banks would be permitted to double 
charge trust customers for management fees on the common trust fund 
as well as the individual trust accounts

former savings and loan owner charles h 
keating cannot fully defend himself against federal administrative 
charges without risking a conviction in a separate criminal case 
his attorneys say 
keating asserted his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination in a reply to the charges filed by the office of 
thrift supervision he also asked ots to postpone a hearing on the 
case until after he resolves the criminal charges 
keatings lawyers in documents released thursday by ots said 
it was difficult for their client to focus on the administrative 
proceeding because he has been jailed since sept 18 in lieu of 5 
million bail in the 42count criminal indictment in los angeles 
on aug 9 the thrift office filed administrative charges 
seeking 409 million in reimbursement from keating for his actions 
as chairman of the american continental corp the phoenixbased 
holding company for lincoln savings and loan based in irvine 
calif 
it also sought to ban him from ever owning or working for a bank 
or savings institution 
his lawyers said further refusal to testify at a hearing would 
risk an unfavorable ruling in the administrative case but they 
said waiving his fifth amendment rights would risk a conviction in 
the criminal case where keating faces a maximum jail sentence of 
10 years 
besides putting mr keating in a nowin position the very 
real threat of future criminal prosecution would no doubt cause key 
thirdparty defense witnesses to invoke their fifth amendment 
rights in the thrift office proceeding further undercutting mr 
keatings defense they said 
the government loses little by delaying the hearing because 
keating with a negative net worth of 4 million lacks the 
wherewithal to satisfy any judgment his attorneys said 
moreover keating is willing to agree not to participate in the 
affairs of any federally insured depository institution the 
documents said 
regulators seized lincoln in april 1989 later estimating the 
taxpayer cost for protecting depositors at as much as 2 billion 
besides keating others asserting their fifth amendment rights 
in the thrift office case are judy j wischer former president 
and chief executive officer of american continental robert j 
kielty who was a senior vice president and general counsel of the 
company charles h keating iii a former executive vice president 
and the elder keatings son and two of keatings sonsinlaw who 
were vice presidents robert j hubbard and robert m wurzelbacher 
jr 
in an unrelated case thomas spiegel former chief executive and 
chairman of columbia savings and loan association of beverly hills 
calif denied thrift office charges filed against him july 5 and 
amended sept 4 
spiegel was accused by the thrift office of squandering millions 
of the sampls funds on luxury condominiums limousines a gun 
collection and such exotica as survival chamber bathrooms with 
bulletproof glass and an independent air and food supply 
in a reply dated sept 21 but released thursday spiegels 
lawyers asked for dismissal of the charges and reimbursement from 
the government for attorneys fees and other expenses 
columbia which is under new management and has not been seized 
by regulators is the industrys largest holder of junk bonds

new england telephone and new york telephone 
will make a voluntary 14 million payment to the us treasury and 
cut their longdistance rates 355 million to resolve allegations 
that they overcharged customers from 1984 to 1988 
the 14 million payment announced thursday as part of a 
consent decree between the companies and the federal communications 
commission is a record amount and is identical to a proposed fine 
the fcc had announced in february 
but the fcc said the payment was not a fine and it was making no 
finding of wrongdoing the commission said it was ending its 
enforcement action against the companies 
the 355 million is the interstate portion of an alleged 1185 
million in overcharges for equipment supplies and services the fcc 
had said the two phone companies paid materiel enterprises co the 
unregulated purchasing arm of new yorkbased nynex corp from 1984 
to 1988 nynex is the parent firm of new york and new england 
telephone 
the fcc had said the 355 million was charged to longdistance 
companies such as american telephone amp telegraph co mci and us 
sprint for connecting with the local phone network the 
longdistance companies pass those charges on to residential and 
business customers 
toby webb nynex vice president for government affairs said he 
could not estimate how much longdistance phone bills would be 
affected by the 355 million rebate 
local phone rates will not be affected 
nynex agreed to the 355 million rebate to be made within 30 
days and also said the two phone companies would reduce their 
capital accounts by 326 million to remove the alleged excess 
profits on plant and equipment purchased from meco materiel 
enterprises 
we hope this puts to rest any questions concerning nynexs 
desire to comply with all fcc regulations and policies in 
transactions among affiliate companies nynex chairman william c 
ferguson said in a statement 
nynex had claimed the fcc was incorrectly subjecting nynex to 
accounting rules that were established in 1977 for atampt and its 
unregulated affiliate western electric co nynex said thursday it 
continued to hold that view 
webb said the 14 million contribution to the treasury will be 
paid by nynex shareholders and will not effect telephone rates 
he estimated the consent decree would have an effect of about 12 
cents per share on earnings in the third quarter that doesnt 
mean pershare earnings will go down by that much since other 
factors are involved he added 
the agreement ends one of several pending federal or state 
actions against nynex one of the seven regional bell holding 
companies that were created in 1984 from the old bell system 
nynex also has been the focus of investigations into bawdy 
parties in florida for nynex employees and vendors that included 
prostitutes nynex has denied that any ratepayer funds were 
involved in the conventions 
in may the justice department filed a onecount criminal 
indictment alleging that nynex had violated the information 
services restrictions in the 1982 consent decree that created the 
regional bell companies nynex denied any wrongdoing 
on wednesday new york state utility regulators authorized a 
study into whether nynex should be forced to divest new york 
telephone 
in its february announcement the commission said new york 
telephone new england telephone meco apparently had violated fcc 
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies 
and an unregulated affiliates 
fcc commissioner andrew c barrett said in a statement thursday 
he believed the fcc could have won its case in court 
however he said the commission still had sent a clear message 
to phone companies that if they violate our rules they should be 
prepared to pay the penalty

americas climbing unemployment rate which 
has fanned fears that the nation is skidding into a recession 
isnt expected to improve any time soon analysts say 
they will get their first look at the nations economic activity 
for september with todays release of the labor departments 
unemployment report 
in advance of the reports release many economists said the 
unemployment rate probably rose last month to 57 percent from 
augusts 56 percent 
that would mark the third consecutive jump in the jobless rate 
and put it well above the 52 percent rate recorded in june in 
july and august the ranks of the jobless swelled by 550000 people 
as the unemployment rate for the twomonth period jumped 04 
percentage points 
the recent increase in joblessness reflects a us economy that 
was showing little signs of life even before iraqs aug 2 invasion 
of kuwait sent oil prices soaring and increased fears of an 
imminent recession 
an uptick to a 57 percent unemployment rate which would be 
the highest level in more than two years would provide further 
evidence of an economic downturn said allen sinai chief economist 
at the boston co 
a rise to 57 percent does not suggest a caving in of the 
economy it simply underscores the slide said sinai one of 
many analysts who believe the nation is already in a recession 
government data to back up the theory is not yet available 
many analysts expected the labor departments report to probably 
show that the nations industries produced around 50000 new jobs 
last month excluding the lost jobs caused by the temporary census 
workers laid off by the government 
a jobs gain of 50000 would be considered mediocre especially 
when compared with the robust jobs gains of last year when the 
economy was producing nearly 200000 jobs a month 
before the recent rise in unemployment caused largely by the 
economys failure to produce many new jobs the jobless rate had 
stayed relatively low and stable fluctuating within a tenth of a 
percentage point of 53 percent for much of the past year and 
onehalf 
many economists say the only reason the unemployment rate has 
not risen faster in recent months is because fewer americans are 
entering the work force 
one of these months there will be a more normal growth in the 
labor force on top of weak jobs growth well see a big jump in 
the unemployment rate and it will be very scary sinai said

stock prices rebounded on the tokyo stock exchange 
today but the gains were held in check by congress failure to 
pass the proposed us budget the dollar meanwhile plunged 
against the yen 
analysts said the surge higher indicated investors had digested 
the finance minstrys marketpropping measures announced monday and 
were less skittish about the middle east crisis 
the governments steps included slightly shorter trading times 
for stock options and an increase in margin deposits which went 
into effect today 
stocks continued to receive support from us federal reserve 
chairman alan greenspans comments earlier in the week that hinted 
lower interest rates were likely 
but news of the us budgets failure hit the market in the 
early afternoon depressing the days gains just at the time you 
think you are out of it the bear market swats you upside the head 
again said darryl whitten a prudentialbache securities inc 
analyst 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected stocks rebounded 54946 
points or 247 percent to close at 2282765 it fell 57120 
points or 256 percent on thursday 
trading was moderate on the first section with an estimated 450 
million shares changing hands 
masaki sumi a manager at sanyo securities said that beyond the 
finance ministrys measures fundamentally you cant find 
many positive factors so most institutional investors are 
sidelined and a small amount of buying can push up prices 
traders said big losses have kept institutional investors out of 
the market as of thursday the nikkei had lost 2776 percent of 
its value before aug 2 when iraq invaded kuwait 
negatives such as inflationary pressures and higher oil prices 
are expected to keep interest rates high 
the usual bear market that chases a long bull session probably 
will last until well into 1991 despite the record bounce on 
tuesday after the finance ministrys announcement whitten said 
on tuesday the market scored a 267655point surge its 
biggest in history 
the direction of trading next week will depend on how wall 
street responds to the budgets failure and to us september 
unemployment figures due out today in washington he said 
the dollar meanwhile suffered from the stock markets rise 
the prospect of lower interest rates in the united states and from 
a weakening us economy lower interest rates tend to curb demand 
for dollars by making returns on dollardenominated investments 
less attractive 
the dollar closed at 13372 yen down 218 from thursdays 
close 
in bond dealings the yield of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese government bonds dropped to 8110 percent by 3 pm from

the governments rail inspection system isnt 
good enough to guarantee that trains are running safely the 
general accounting office said today 
last year the government failed to inspect 1164 miles of 
track skipping over 18 percent of all railroads that own track 
the federal railroad administration also did not verify the 
accuracy of 54 percent of the accident or incident reports filed by 
railroads said the gao the investigative arm of congress 
fra does not have assurance that the nations 580 railroads 
are running safely gao associate director john w hill jr said 
in testimony submitted for a hearing today by the house energy and 
commerce subcommittee on transportation tourism and hazardous 
materials 
we found that 32 railroads did not receive any type of 
inspection in 1989 typically these were the smaller shortline 
railroads which have higher accident and injury rates than overall 
industry averages hill said 
because there are no standards telling railroad inspectors how 
often they must examine tracks signals equipment and operating 
practices there is no way to know whether the lack of annual 
inspections translates into a special safety risk he said 
the gao also criticized the fra for failing to pay special 
attention to railroads with poor safety histories or a string of 
accidents 
while the number of union pacific accidents in idaho more than 
doubled between 1986 and 1988 the total number of union pacific 
inspections in idaho decreased nearly 38 percent during this time 
period hill said 
federal railroad administrator gilbert e carmichael said the 
report broadly confirms many of my own conclusions 
fra must improve the training of its inspectors and it 
must use its data more scientifically in planning inspections and 
in assuring consistent application of safety regulations he 
said 
but carmichael also said that rail safety improved during the 
1980s he said his agencys success should be measured by overall 
safety performance from the railroads and not whether each 
instance of noncompliance is corrected

trans world airlines struggling with 
increasing fuel prices is expected to issue layoff notices to as 
many as 500 employees across the country today 
twa spokesman donald morrison said thursday the layoffs would 
center on management and clerical employees and would not disrupt 
service 
this whole thing is fuelrelated morrison said it 
doesnt have anything to do with everything else that is going 
on 
in the united states twa is paying more than 90 cents a gallon 
for jet fuel roughly twice as much as before iraq invaded kuwait 
more layoffs and possibly flight reductions could come later 
morrison said twa which has its hub in st louis has about 
33000 employees worldwide the cuts are expected to affect about 
100 of the roughly 8000 workers in st louis 
the airline has been taking other steps to cut costs to counter 
the surge in fuel prices and a slowdown in travel 
in the past two weeks the steadily shrinking carrier has 
decided to pull out of two more cities close its flight base in 
los angeles and stop hiring and training new pilots and flight 
attendants 
twa also put the squeeze on its advertising agency young amp 
rubicam inc but its bid for lower rates backfired when the firm 
took the unusual step of giving up the airlines 45 million 
account 
twa chairman carl icahn told the wall street journal that the 
airline would replace young amp rubicam by doing some of the work 
itself and hiring a small creative shop to do the rest 
twa said wednesday that it might make even more cuts in the new 
schedule that takes effect oct 28 the airline already has 
announced it will pull out of harrisburg pa and oslo norway 
since the beginning of the year twa has abandoned long beach 
and burbank calif madison wis midway airport in chicago 
freeport and nassau in the bahamas and stuttgart germany 
last week the airline said it intended to close its pilot base 
in los angeles on jan 1 and shift about 300 west coast crew 
members to bases in new york and st louis 
icahn told leaders of the air line pilots association that cost 
studies showed the closing would save the carrier money over the 
next two years 
the union is questioning that claim saying the expense of 
retraining pilots who shift to new cockpit positions or new 
equipment might eclipse the projected savings 
three of twas rivals usair group inc pan am corp and 
midway airlines inc already have announced layoffs in response 
to the problems that have gripped the industry 
twa headquartered in mt kisco ny lost 300 million last 
year and had to pay 366 million in interest on debt totaling 25 
billion

ual corp chairman stephen m wolf sold most of 
his ual stock rights far below the price he has asked from the 
union group trying to buy the company according to a report 
published today 
wolf sold 200000 of his 208333 stock rights for 150 per share 
this spring the wall street journal reported john c pope uals 
chief financial officer recently sold 50000 of his 60000 rights 
the journal reported citing unnamed persons familiar with the 
transaction 
the union group trying to buy the parent company of united 
airlines is racing to meet a tuesday deadline to secure financing 
uals board accepted a 201pershare 44 billion bid in april 
but the employee group is expected to value the airline at 165 to 
175 per share or 36 billion to 38 billion 
wolf was concerned the union group would find a way to nullify 
his rights if he waited to sell until after the buyout was 
complete the newspaper said 
wolf and pope sold the rights in light of the unions 
clearly stated intent to replace them with their own senior 
management if the buyout succeeds a spokesman for wolf told the 
paper 
union officials discounted that explanation saying wolf would 
not have lost his rights under a change of management the journal 
reported 
he obviously has no interest in seeing the deal close a 
union official said 
it would be pretty inconsistent for ual directors to say 
shareholders cant get 170 today when wolf sold for 150 said a 
ual shareholder who asked not be named 
were offering the shareholders more than 150 a share 
said frederick c dubinsky president of the united pilots union 
one of the unions involved in the buyout bid how can wolf tell 
the board our offer isnt enough 
wolf has denied trying to block the buyout bid 
ual stock fell 637 to 10537 a share thursday on the new 
york stock exchange the stock has traded as low as 8725 since 
wolf sold his shares

polly peck international plc may seek to raise 
cash by selling a stake in its del monte fruit and produce business 
to the public early next year reports published today said 
the wall street journal said proceeds from a possible sale of 40 
percent of del monte for 400 million would be used to pay off some 
of polly pecks 158 billion in longterm debt 
the journal account quoting unidentified sources close to the 
company said the public offering also would ease pressure from 
shortterm lenders who have clamped down on credit lines to polly 
peck 
separately the londonbased financial times quoted polly peck 
chairman asil nadir saying the interest in del monte would offered 
on the new york stock exchange 
polly peck bought del monte the worlds largest distributor of 
bananas last year from rjr nabisco inc for 875 million polly 
peck also has interests in consumer electronics and the leisure 
industry 
polly pecks lines of credit were tightened after the sept 20 
trading suspension in the companys shares the suspension stemmed 
from an inquiry by britains serious fraud office into a possible 
stock manipulation scheme in polly peck shares 
the suspension which is still in force has given polly peck a 
liquidity problem the company said earlier this week 
bankers for the cashstarved conglomerate were meeting with the 
companys managers today to discuss the liquidity problem and 
arrange a credit package 
the critical meeting came as the foreign office confirmed a 
report in todays financial times that foreign secretary douglas 
hurd sent a message to the turkish government last week 
the financial times said the telegram signed by hurd called on 
the turkish government to provide about 190 million to rescue the 
embattled company which is a major employer in turkishoccupied 
cyprus 
hurds letter was in reply to a letter received from turkish 
economics minister which said that turkey was considering aid to 
polly peck the financial times said

americas unemployment rate posted its third 
consecutive increase in september rising to 57 percent the 
government reported today as the economy continued to flash warning 
signals of an impending recession 
the 01 percentage point increase pushed the jobless rate to its 
highest level since the spring of 1988 and private economists 
predicted even higher unemployment figures in the months ahead 
reflecting a deteriorating us economy 
more industries lost jobs than gained them in september causing 
an overall loss of 101000 jobs from nonfarm payrolls the labor 
department said about 42000 of those were census workers laid off 
by the government 
it marked the first time since the 198182 recession that the 
unemployment rate increased three months in a row the government 
said 
while the bush administration continues to insist that the 
country can avoid a recession a growing number of economists think 
the country has either already entered a recession or will be in 
one before the end of the year 
its an economy thats started the slide down the slippery 
slope said robert dederick chief economist at the northern 
trust co of chicago the weakness has become more diffused 
which is characteristic of an economy losing ground 
janet norwood commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics 
noted the weakness in septembers jobs data had hit factories and 
service industries alike 
few areas of the economy are escaping the downward tug of the 
current economic slowdown mrs norwood said 
last months 57 percent jobless rate was the highest since it 
was that same level in march 1988 the unemployment rate hasnt 
been worse since it was 58 percent in november 1987 
the nations employment picture began a downward spiral in july 
as the nations economy began failing to produce enough jobs to 
keep up with the number of americans looking for work since then 
the jobless rate has risen 05 percentage points from junes rate 
of 52 percent 
the rapid jump in the jobless rate over the past three months 
reflected a us economy that was showing little signs of life even 
before iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait sent oil prices soaring and 
increased fears of an imminent downturn 
the 101000job loss in september though inflated by the census 
workers was the biggest job decline since the economy lost 104000 
jobs in june 1986 the government said a year ago the economy was 
producing nearly 200000 new jobs a month 
the nations jobless rate is derived from a household survey 
but most economists consider a separate survey of business 
establishments from which the government gets its figures on how 
many new jobs were created in a given month a better barometer of 
economic activity 
the slump in the manufacturing sector continued in september as 
factory jobs posted a 66000 job loss it was the 17th time out of 
18 months that manufacturing jobs declined 
since reaching a post recession peak in january 1989 the 
manufacturing sector has lost more than 500000 jobs the 
government said 
in september construction also continued on its downward slide 
posting the fourth decline in as many months to reflect weakness in 
the housing market after seasonal adjustment construction jobs 
fell by 20000 bringing losses in the industry to more than 
100000 in recent months 
the serviceproducing sector which until a few months ago had 
been enjoying robust job growth and providing most of the economys 
steam actually lost 17000 jobs in september within the sector 
the services industry itself which employs one in four nonfarm 
workes added only 20000 jobs one of the smallest gains since 
the 198182 recession 
health services which had added an average of 50000 jobs each 
month in the first half of this year continued to show healthy 
gains adding 45000 jobs last month 
labor costs which are frequently blamed for worsening the 
nations inflation problems rose a sharp 05 percent the average 
hourly worker made 1013 an hour in september up from the 1008 
made in august 
the labor departments household survey showed that overall 
total civilian employment was about 1179 million in september up 
from the 1177 million employed in august 
the jobless numbered nearly 71 million slightly up from the 7 
million employed in august 
the average manufacturing workweek was 41 hours in september 
unchanged from august manufacturing overtime was 37 hours last 
month down from augusts average of 38 overtime hours 
in a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of 
the armed services stationed in the united states the september 
jobless rate was 56 percent up from the 55 percent in august but 
lower than septembers civilian rate of 57 percent 
the unemployment rate among major demographic groups last month 
was 
adult white men 43 percent unchanged from august 
adult white women 42 percent unchanged from august 
white teenagers 125 percent down from 132 percent 
all blacks 121 percent up from 118 percent 
adult black men 118 percent up from 106 percent 
adult black women 103 percent up from 99 percent 
black teenagers 269 percent down from 35 percent 
hispanics 87 percent up from 78 percent

rising imports and overseas tourism helped slash 
japans trade and services surplus by 725 percent in august from 
the same month last year the finance ministry said friday 
despite some fluctuations the surplus in the current account 
the widest measure of a nations trade in goods and services has 
generally been declining in recent months 
that has been good news to japanese officials pressured by 
trading partners particularly the united states to cut the 
surplus 
augusts drop to 942 million from 343 billion in august 1989 
was the largest decline in the surplus since january when it 
registered a deficit for the first time in six years 
in july the current account surplus fell 63 percent from a year 
earlier to 202 billion following a moderate 12 percent rise the 
previous month 
the ministry said japans august trade surplus which measures 
only goods fell 154 percent from the previous year to 412 
billion 
imports rose 72 percent to 1777 billion for their fifth 
consecutive month of increase the value of imports was the 
fourthlargest ever the ministry said 
ministry officials said the effect of higher oil prices from 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait did not surface during the month 
although the total volume of japans crude oil imports rose 48 
percent from august 1989 to 181 million kiloliters the total 
value dropped 04 percent to 186 billion because of lower prices 
the ministry said 
the officials said the impact of higher oil prices was likely to 
start being felt in october trade figures 
auto imports in august rose 216 percent while imports of 
machinery such as office equipment rose 71 percent art imports 
surged 1603 percent 
exports rose for the third consecutive month despite the recent 
strengthening of the yen against the dollar they edged up 21 
percent to 2189 billion in part because of stronger exports of 
automobiles up 64 percent and audiovideo equipment up 75 
percent ministry officials said 
but the officials said the chief cause of the drop in the 
current account surplus was a rise in the invisible trade 
deficit which includes investment flows and tourism to its 
secondhighest level ever 
the tourism deficit rose to 209 billion in august surpassing 
the record deficit set in august 1989 of 196 billion 
ministry officials said 109 million japanese went abroad in 
august the first time that more than 1 million people left the 
country during one month 
economists also pointed to a growing deficit in capital flows 
the longterm capital account deficit in august was 484 billion 
up sharply from 363 billion in august 1989 the ministry said

a cut in shortterm interest rates by the 
federal reserve board could take months to affect the economy and 
even then it might be too little too late economists say 
some say that regardless of what type of federal budget 
agreement ultimately is approved they expect the central bank to 
moderately lower its target for the federal funds rate the 
interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to 7 percent 
from 8 percent 
but as the economy moves closer to recession it moves further 
from the feds control analysts say 
the fed is going to be pretty much impotent to stop whats 
already on track said ray stone of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates inc referring to beliefs that the economy is already 
in a recession or quickly headed for one 
such a small cut in the fed funds rate may be absorbed by banks 
trying to bolster earnings and never affect consumer and business 
loans through a cut in the prime rate said john lonski chief 
economist at moodys investors service inc a debtrating agency 
a lower fed funds rate would mean banks would pay a smaller 
wholesale price for money banks could widen their profit margin by 
holding the prime rate steady 
twenty five basis points onefourth of a percentage point 
for the most part will help shore up bank earnings whether or not 
well see any discernible difference in lending rates remains to be 
seen lonski said 
lonski and others anticipate another 25 basis point cut in the 
fed funds rate before long that would likely be enough to affect 
the prime he said 
it might be a longshot but a move to lower interest rates could 
have a psychological impact on consumers by making them more 
confident that the economy will recover soon 
consumer confidence has sagged and as people feel less secure 
in their jobs they are more prone to spend less money a signal 
that the fed is trying to move the economy could boost spending 
maybe theyll go out and buy that new car stone said 
others were more skeptical 
as far as consumer attitudes are concerned more people will be 
looking to the persian gulf than the federal reserve said alan 
levenson of the wefa group an economic forecasting firm in 
suburban philadelphia 
moreover its doubtful most consumers know or care what the fed 
funds rate is doing 
what the man on the street wants to see is a reduction in the 
cost in borrowing from banks such as a significant downward 
movement in variable rate mortgages lonski said 
economists warn that although fed chairman alan greenspan is 
confident that congressional approval of a credible budget 
agreement would lead to lower shortterm interest rates plans to 
ease monetary policy could still be scuttled 
members of the house fearful of taking tax hikes and spending 
cuts to their constituents less than a month before an election 
stalled passage of a compromise package of tax increases and 
spending cuts 
the house on friday rejected the 500 billion deficitreduction 
proposal backed by president bush and greenspan an alternative 
proposal might not be to greenspans liking and could steer the fed 
away from following a more generous credit course 
then theres inflation 
the persian gulf crisis has been sending oil prices on a 
rollercoaster ride fanning inflation fears 
more proof of the negative impact the middle east situation is 
having on us inflation will be available in a few weeks the 
labor department will release the september consumer price index on 
oct 18 it is expected to show a 1 percent jump 
many analysts have noted the fed appears more concerned with 
controlling inflation by keeping interest rates high than with 
spurring economic activity by cutting borrowing rates 
the rise in oil prices the budget impasse and the weaker 
dollar which increases the price of imports have been blamed for 
inhibiting the fed 
even assuming that congress eventually cracks the budget 
deadlock economists still warn that a sharp rise in prices could 
spook the fed from relaxing its guard against inflation

the british pound will enter europes exchange 
rate mechanism a move that will link the currency closely to its 
european neighbors and limit exchange rate movements an official 
said today 
chancellor of the exchequer john major said that as part of the 
move which will take effect monday a key british interest rate 
will simultaneously drop by one percentage point to 14 percent 
joining the exchange rate mechanism symbolizes britains 
willingness to participate in european integration ahead of 1992 
when europe is scheduled to meld into one marketplace of 220 
million consumers 
despite the cooperative stance prime minister margaret thatcher 
still remains opposed to creating single a european central bank 
and a single currency 
the pound which had been rising in anticipation of the 
announcement surged on the news to 19360 from 19185 in early 
trading against the german mark the pound also catapulted to 
29953 marks from 29492 marks stock prices also soared 
the european communitys monetary committee is likely to approve 
the british plan for the pound to join the european monetary 
systems erm 
under the terms of entry national central banks are obliged to 
prevent their currencies from falling outside prescribed bands by 
direct market intervention 
the move which takes a freefloating pound and ties it to other 
currencies should limit disruptive exchange rate movements and 
promote economic stability 
a high pound also should help fight inflation by lowering the 
cost of imports 
thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other 
currencies at a community summit meeting in madrid last year but 
said she would move only when britains inflation rate was lower 
however the government went ahead despite the current high 
inflation rate of 106 percent 
the pound will enter the mechanism at a central rate of 29500 
german marks and like the spanish peseta will be allowed to 
fluctuate by 6 percent above or below that rate the treasury said 
the other participating currencies are limited to a narrow 225 
percent band 
rates have been adjusted 12 times since the mechanisms 
inception 11 years ago the mechanism has avoided any major 
adjustments to rates in the last 3 12 years 
the other currencies already in the mechanism are the german 
mark the french franc the dutch guilder the italian lira the 
belgian and luxembourg francs the danish krone and the irish 
pound 
not participating are the portuguese escudo and the greek 
drachma

the securities and exchange commission wants 
the accounting profession to change methods 
whoa dont stop reading yet 
altering the way the beancounters count could mean big 
differences in the way a company reports its financial health that 
could have farreaching effects on your employer investments and 
future 
as we enter the decade of the 1990s we should consider a 
fundamental shift in the goal we set for the accounting standards 
for financial institutions sec chairman richard c breeden told 
the senate banking committee 
had such a change been undertaken years ago for example it may 
have helped avoid one of the worst financial debacles of all time 
the thrift industrys collapse estimated to cost american 
taxpayers 500 billion over the next 40 years 
how thrift assets were counted made all the difference said 
breeden using the currently approved method savings amp loans 
showed a healthy surplus in assets the cash securities and real 
estate they controlled 
but when the thrifts began failing and the government took them 
over and began selling off those assets the market value turned 
out to be a deficit largely because of the accounting for the debt 
securities which had made them grossly overvalued 
present accounting standards known as generally accepted 
accounting principles or gaap allow financial institutions to 
count debt securities one of two ways depending upon whether they 
were bought for trading purposes or for long term investment 
that treatment exalts psychology over economic worth 
breeden said in a recent interview i mean it comes down to an 
exercise for the regulators and accountants to try and determine 
what the motivation or intent was with respect to the holding of 
that security 
if the debt securities are being held for investment their 
value is listed as the purchase price or historic cost whereas if 
they were bought with imminent trading in mind they have to be 
listed at their true value on the market a practice known as 
marked to market 
in essence its like picking grapes leaving them in the sun 
and still calling them grapes long after theyve turned to raisins 
for example says breeden take a hypothetical financial 
institution that buys 1 billion in 30year treasury notes for 
investment 
the very next year they fell to 900 million the idea that 
for the next 29 years that loss can be carried as if it didnt 
happen it demonstrates the degree of distortion that can result 
from this distinction based on investment intent vs trading 
intent said breeden who as a white house aide helped draft the 
thrift bailout legislation 
breeden has made changing that distinction a top priority and 
has called in officials of the top accounting standardssetting 
groups to persuade them 
the sec oversees the accounting profession because accountants 
must certify the accuracy of financial statements that companies 
file with the agency 
but in the past the sec has left most of the rulemaking 
authority to private industry organizations 
the most important are the financial accounting standards board 
which sets the general rules for accounting gaap and the american 
institute of certified public accountants which oversees testing 
of certified public accountants and provides accounting principles 
for specialized industries such as financial institutions 
these groups tend to move cautiously when considering changes 
last month the accounting institutes standards committee withdrew 
a proposal that would have created tougher standards for financial 
institutions accounting methods but stopped short of a complete 
rollback after the sec complained 
at a meeting earlier this month with officials of the standards 
board and the accounting institute breeden urged them to 
reconsider guidelines for listing debt securities on financial 
institutions balance sheets 
weve committed to get back to chairman breeden within 30 days 
on whether or not we are willing to undertake tis project said 
thomas kelley vice president of the accounting institute said 
the accounting officials pledged to give breeden a response to his 
proposal in 30 days but kelley said the earliest such a change 
could take place would be the end of 1991 
theres no question something has to be done said walter 
primhoff director of professional programs for the new york state 
society of certified public accountants but he expressed worry 
over too much sec meddling 
the sec has not very often interfered in this process he 
said theres only been a few times where theyve come in and 
said we dont like what you did with the rule were going to 
change it 
if it happens occasionally it just shows there is a 
responsible public oversight but if it becomes a very frequent 
occurence accounting standards will become politicized and if 
they do the people who rely on them for making decisions probably 
will be forced to rely on them less 
eventually the sec may push beyond the limited issue of debt 
securities at financial institutions 
but even breeden concedes moving beyond that to other types of 
assets is a direction that we think ought to be pursued but that 
has to be done very carefully and very deliberately 
one of the other four sec commissioners philip r lochner jr 
said the commission has taken no action yet to explore a wider use 
of market price accounting 
its kind of premature to go beyond that we may go much 
farther but im just speaking for myself said lochner

woolrich inc which primarily manufactures 
outdoor clothing will lay off more than half its 2600 employees 
nationwide because it has few orders for deliveries beyond 
december the company said 
in a letter delivered to employees this week woolrich president 
s wade judy said a soft retail market and high inventory levels 
would force the company to lay off about 1500 employees at least 
until spring 
layoff notices will begin going out this month and those who 
will be released should know their fate by the end of november 
said rod bailey the companys vice president of human resources 
we feel badly about this at this time of year but we really 
dont have much choice about it he said 
judys letter said consumer buying habits were shifting away 
from woolrichs basic line of outdoor clothing he said the company 
has developed new lines of clothing for the current season but 
that there were few orders for delivery in 1991 
we dont have ample orders beyond dec 10 which is very 
unusual and a major reason for the work force curtailment bailey 
said 
woolrich has 2600 employees nationwide at five plants in 
pennsylvania two in georgia two in colorado and one in nebraska 
in the spring woolrich placed more than 1000 workers on a 
threeday work week but reinstated all to a 40hour week within 
two months bailey said

among the grim findings 
stock mutual funds lost an average of 155 percent during the 
third quarter compared with a gain of nearly 6 percent in the 
preceding three months according to lipper analytical securities 
corp the quarter was the worst since the fourth quarter of 1987 
which included black monday

the end of the 1982 recession the national association of 
purchasing management said 
unemployment increased for the third straight month in 
september to 57 percent the highest level since the spring of 
1988 
helpwanted advertising dropped in august in another sign of

sales of cars and trucks by us automakers dropped 37 
percent in late september capping the worst model year since 1983

polly peck international plc on friday secured a 
temporary debt repayment moratorium from lenders gaining time to 
cope with a liquidity crunch the company said 
the food and electronics company controlled by asil nadir its 
chairman and chief executive had sought the freeze on repayments 
after lenders clamped down on its credit lines 
the lines of credit were tightened after the sept 20 trading 
suspension in polly pecks stock the suspension which is still in 
force caused the liquidity problems the company said earlier this 
week 
the trading halt stemmed from an inquiry by britains serious 
fraud office into a possible stock manipulation scheme in polly 
peck shares 
the payment moratorium came after bankers for the cashstarved 
conglomerate met with the company management on friday 
it was agreed by the bankers and other lenders that a 
temporary standstill would be granted to the company so that the 
best way forward may be discussed the company said in a brief 
news release late friday 
the release added that the discussions will be conducted by a 
steering committee of 10 representatives of the lenders and may 
lead to a longer standstill period the panel may wait to conclude 
its business until after reviewing a report on polly peck being 
done by an accounting firm 
executives of polly peck werent available to comment on the 
exact terms of the standstill arrangement a company spokesman 
speaking anonymously said he wasnt authorized to elaborate on the 
matter 
banking industry sources gave conflicting reports on how long 
the moratorium would last it was expected to run from one week to 
a few weeks but not as long as the 90 days polly peck had sought 
standard chartered plc a major uk commercial bank is leading 
the polly peck steering committee and will be responsible for 
coordinating further talks between the company and its lenders 
according to banking sources who didnt wish to be identified 
polly pecks announcement also suggested that the review being 
done by accountants from coopers amp lybrand deloitte would ease 
persistent doubts about the companys financial health 
the report by the british arm of the international accounting 
and consulting firm isnt expected to be completed for three 
months but preliminary findings might be available sooner to polly 
pecks major lenders 
the companys main creditors had contemplated forcing polly peck 
into hands of a courtappointed adminstrator while questions over 
its financial and fiscal soundness were addressed 
but banking sources who attended the friday meeting with polly 
pecks management said the company made a strong case to maintain 
its independence while its financial affairs are sorted out 
there are many many questions which still have to be 
answered said a banker leaving the talks at this point banks 
want to avoid administration said the banker who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
it also emerged friday that the bank of england last week 
advised turkey of polly pecks urgent need for 190 million 
the bank of england the countrys central bank declined to 
comment on its involvement with polly peck and the turkish 
government which has indicated it is considering offering some 
form of assistance to the company and its turkish chairman

in the midst of a bear market on wall street 
some analysts are keeping busy searching out the seeds of future 
opportunities 
prolonged declines in stock prices are naturally painful and 
dispiriting to investors these observers acknowledge but they add 
that many of the best opportunities to buy stocks for handsome 
returns have come in periods of financial travail 
there is no question that the market is currently weak says 
george putnam iii in the current issue of his investment advisory 
publication the turnaround letter 
the word we hear most often to describe market conditions 
these days is ugly investors are very skittish and any bad news 
will send a stock plummeting 
but we view the current market as an attractive buying 
opportunity good companies in all categories have been hammered 
over the last two months and they will recover sharply when 
investors regain some confidence in the market 
it may not happen this month or even this year but it will 
happen 
or as barton biggs at the investment banking firm of morgan 
stanley amp co puts it the bear is aging in the us i think we 
are somewhere in the second half of a cyclical bear market in 
which the averages normally decline in the range of 20 percent to 
30 percent 
the bad news is no secret anymore everyone knows most of the 
bear story 
the news doesnt have to become good for stocks to stop going 
down just that it is less bad than what has already been 
discounted in prices 
the scare scenarios always seem more credible when the markets 
are falling but you have to be careful not to get more bearish as 
prices decline instead you logically should become more bullish 
because you can buy quality goods cheaper 
i think we have further to go in this bear market but as 
prices go down i want to begin averaging in 
observers like putnam and biggs readily concede how difficult it 
is to call a market bottom 
indeed some analysts contend that stocks are likely to keep 
sliding as long as it takes to discourage just about all the 
bargain hunters and selfproclaimed patient optimists 
this global bear market should still be respected and treated 
with great caution says stan weinstein publisher of the 
professional tape reader advisory in hollywood fla 
in the past week the market made some fitful efforts to rally 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed friday at 251064 
up 5816 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 285 to 
17070 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 1285 to 34736 and the american stock exchange market value 
index lost 124 to 30648 
volume on the big board averaged 16496 million shares a day 
against 17148 million the week before 
most analysts believe stock prices at recent levels have already 
taken into account a moderate relatively short recession their 
main worry is that confidence among investors will suffer some 
further blows raising the prospect of a deeper and longer slump 
in every bear phase there has been what seemed to be a 
plausible doomsday scenario that terrorized investors biggs 
said in retrospect most of them seem farfetched but they sure 
scared me at the time 
if the economic apocalypse does really come this time it 
wont happen overnight and my guess is that the central banks will 
try to inflate their way out 
we are not going through the end of the world just the end of 
the euphoria some gloomy rainy day for no clearly discernible 
reason stocks will stop declining

the failed federal budget accord slammed stock 
and bond prices friday but the markets recovered nearly all the 
lost ground partly on president bushs tough stance against 
congress 
the key dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped nearly 
70 points after the opening bell before steadying to close the day 
down 619 points at 251064 
in a lengthy night session a rebellious house early friday 
overwhelmingly defeated the 500billion compromise package of tax 
increases and spending cuts sought by bush and congressional 
leaders 
wall street professionals had hoped for a budget accord to help 
reduce the amount of borrowing needed to pay the federal deficit 
and spur the federal reserve to reduce interest rates to stimulate 
economic activity lower interest rates tend to make stocks and 
bonds more valuable 
in an unstable market already whipped by rising oil prices and 
the turmoil in the persian gulf the congressional rejection 
initially appeared to quash those possibilities 
its more uncertainty said dan williams head of equity 
trading with dillon read amp co with the middle east now all you 
need is another guy throwing the hat in the ring 
the opening plunge triggered a new york stock exchange restraint 
on computerized selling strategies aimed at helping stabilize the 
market an outgrowth of the stock market crash nearly three years 
ago 
but stocks and bonds staged a gradual recovery during the day as 
some traders believed the selloff was too great and that budget 
negotiators would resolve their differences 
additionally a white house statement that bush would refuse to 
sign emergency financing legislation to keep the government 
operating heartened some traders looking for strong leadership in 
washington 
ward mccarthy a managing director of stone amp mccarthy research 
associates in princeton nj said the markets believe congress 
will not allow a longterm government shutdown and therefor they 
will come to vote for the accord and probably soon 
stock and bond prices also received a boost when britain dropped 
a key interest rate and announced that the pound will enter 
europes exchange rate mechanism effective monday those moves 
incited a rally in british stocks and the buying mood spilled over 
to wall street 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of the economy and 
interest rates the key 30year treasury bond was unchanged after 
falling close to 6 per 1000 in face amount earlier in the day 
its yield finished at 878 percent 
oil contracts traded in the futures market which determines 
prices rose 106 to around 3799 a barrel after easing slightly 
on thursday 
a report from the labor department this morning showing 
unemployment in september rose slightly was overshadowed by the 
budget vote and had little effect on the markets strategists said

oil rose more than 1 per barrel friday on harsh 
words from iraq though it still closed lower for the week due to 
resilient speculation that a diplomatic solution will be found to 
the mideast crisis 
that whiff of peace that the market smelled is wearing off 
said annlouise hittle a senior oil analyst with shearson lehman 
brothers inc 
light sweet crude oil went up 106 to 3799 per barrel for 
november delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
for the week crude fell 152 per barrel unable to erase sharp 
losses from monday and tuesday when prices plummeted a total of 
more than 5 on what were construed as peaceful overtures from iraq 
and the united states 
on friday oil traders were responding mostly to news reports 
that iraq would not make any conciliatory statements to the united 
nations in a muchawaited speech that had been canceled twice 
during the week 
an advance copy of iraqs statement showed foreign minister 
tariq aziz was accusing the united states and its allies of 
bringing the entire world to the brink of a devastating war in 
a plot to gain control of persian gulf oil 
america and other nations have assembled a military force in the 
gulf in response to iraqs invasion of kuwait in august 
prices were boosted somewhat during late trading on news friday 
that a jordanian clergyman and government official had urged his 
countrymen to retaliate against the us troops possibly through 
terrorist acts hittle said 
crude oils rise friday was mostly steady and it lifted futures 
for refined products

exchange trading friday as dealers scrambled to buy sterling on 
word it would be formally linked to other major european 
currencies 
the dollar rose against its major foreign counterparts except 
the pound and the japanese yen rebounding from a selloff thursday 
incited by expectations of lower us interest rates 
the dollar buying came mostly as a byproduct of cross trading 
between sterling and the german mark 
gold prices gained modestly in domestic trading but moved mostly 
lower overseas 
market participants in the united states said the dollar began 
on a weak note due to news of another deterioration in the 
countrys job market 
the labor department reported an increase in the unemployment 
rate for the third straight month and a decline in nonfarm 
payrolls the jobless rate rose to 57 percent in september from 
augusts 56 percent 
the houses rejection of a 500 billion deficitcutting 
compromise also was a negative for the dollar because it cast doubt 
on the governments ability to solve the chronic deficit problem 
andrew busch a currency dealer at harris trust in chicago said 
attention turned to sterling around midmorning in the united states 
when the british government announced the pound would join europes 
exchange rate mechanism 
chancellor of the exchequer john major said starting monday the 
pound will join the mechanism that presently links nine of the 
currencies of the 12nation european community 
the move which is expected to help britain fight inflation and 
improve that countrys economic prospects will be coupled with a 1 
percentage point cut in key british interest rates to 14 percent 
the pound jumped to 19455 from 19185 before the announcement 
in london and was more than three cents higher than its level of 
19115 late thursday 
against europes pivotal currency the german mark the pound 
finished at 29933 marks up from 29322 late thursday major said 
the pound will enter the erm at 295 marks and be allowed to 
fluctuate by six percent either way

a pound late in the session more costly than 19145 late 
thursday

bond prices finished little changed friday after 
a volatile session in which failure to reach a federal budget 
accord overshadowed another rise in unemployment 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond ended the day largely 
unchanged recovering from a sharp decline earlier in the day that 
pushed prices down about 6 per 1000 face amount the bonds 
yield dipped to 878 percent from 879 percent late thursday 
the house voted 254179 early friday to reject president bushs 
plan aimed at cutting 500 billion from the federal budget deficit 
bond traders said the rejection made it unlikely the federal 
reserve would take quick action to lower interest rates to spur the 
slumping economy which would boost the value of fixedincome 
instruments such as bonds 
the bond market for weeks has awaited a fed easing and pinned 
its hopes to the budget deal 
the market is realizing that without any federal budget 
accord the fed probably wont ease said kevin flanagan a money 
market economist with dean witter reynolds inc 
the budget collapse took precedence over the labor departments 
report that unemployment rose to 57 percent in september another 
sign of weakening but analysts said the report had some 
inflationary signals which dulled its impact on bonds 
the significance of the report was severely diminished because 
of the knowledge that the fed will not respond to any weak 
economic data until there is a budgetcutting accord said ward 
mccarthy of stone amp mccarthy research associates in princeton nj 
treasury bills dropped sharply at the markets opening with the 
discount yields on threemonth and oneyear bills dropping below 7 
percent for a short time for the first time since august 1988 all 
maturities began rebounding around midmorning 
economists attributed some of the gain to president bushs 
stance refusing to sign emergency legislation to keep the 
government operating that was seen as an attempt by the white 
house to press for a quick resolution to the budget impasse 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of 
shortterm intermediate and longterm government issues all ranged 
from unchanged to up 116 point according to telerate inc a 
financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer rose 068 to 115531 
yields on threemonth treasury bills fell to 725 percent as the 
discount tumbled 9 basis points to 703 percent yields on 
sixmonth bills fell to 742 percent as the discount dropped was 
down 6 basis points to 707 percent yields on oneyear bills fell 
to 749 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis points to 701 
percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest rate banks charge each 
other on overnight loans was quoted at 7 1516 percent down from 
8 316 percent late thursday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively 
traded municipal bonds closed at 88 2332 down 116 point the 
average yield to maturity rose to 777 percent from 776 percent 
late thursday

ual corp employees say chairman stephen wolf 
will look hypocritical if he urges the companys board to reject a 
buyout offer now that hes sold some of his ual stock rights for 
less than the buyout bid 
the united airlines labor unions leading the buyout group 
contend wolf has been lobbying the board not to accept any buyout 
offer less than 201 a share or about 44 billion 
the employees said friday that wolfs sale of stock rights 
indicates his lack of faith if not downright opposition to the 
employee buyout 
but they said the news could help their effort because wolf will 
look hypocritical if he urges uals board to reject an offer thats 
higher than the reported 150 sale price for his stock rights 
meanwhile the buyout group awaited word on whether it has 
enough bank financing to approach the board next week with a bid 
expected to value ual at 165 to 175 a share or 36 billion to 
38 billion 
one person familiar with the situation said the unions expected 
to continue receiving loan commitments through the weekend the 
group needs to line up financing by tuesday when uals board is 
expected to meet 
the wall street journal reported friday that wolf exercised 
200000 of his 208333 stock appreciation rights last spring when 
uals stock was selling at about 150 a share wolf made a 14 
million profit on the deal the newspaper said 
the journal also said uals chief financial officer john pope 
sold 50000 of his 60000 rights at the same time earning 42 
million 
ual stock closed down 262 at 10275 a share on the new york 
stock exchange 
stock appreciation rights when exercised enable their owners 
to receive in cash the amount a stock has increased over the 
exercise price the journal said wolfs rights had an average 
exercise price of 8331 and popes exercise prices averaged 69 
the company confirmed the executives had sold part of their 
stock rights in light of the unions intent to replace them with 
their own senior management team if the buyout bid succeeds 
wolf was said to be worried the unions would nullify the rights 
if they succeeded in buying the company 
airline analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial services inc 
said wolf apparently sold his stock rights because he saw the 
employee buyout offer which was then for 201 a share as 
totally unreasonable or at least he did not believe it was 
doable 
from what i can tell he made a smart business decision 
dexter said noting that uals stock fell as low as 8725 a share 
during the summer 
some observers in the unions camp said wolfs actions confirmed 
that he opposes the employee buyout despite his public statements 
to the contrary 
were offering the shareholders more than 150 a share how 
can wolf tell the board our offer isnt enough said frederick 
dubinsky chairman of the united pilots union 
the four large us banks that are trying the arrange a loan for 
the buyout continued to receive commitments friday from smaller 
banks a source told the associated press 
the banks likely will decide by monday whether to finance the 
deal the source said

the travelers corp said friday it is 
adding 650 million to its reserves to cover expected real estate 
losses a move that will result in a thirdquarter net loss of 500 
million 
the hartfordbased insurance company will also reduce its 
quarterly dividend from 60 cents to 40 cents per share 
edward h budd travelers chairman and chief executive officer 
said reserves were boosted to cover expected losses in the 
companys mortgage loan and real estate investments 
he blamed the sharp decline in the commercial real estate 
market 
following an intensive review of our mortgage loans and real 
estate holdings we determined it appropriate to increase reserves 
to provide for real estate losses which we expect to emerge over a 
number of years budd said 
the company said this was the first major addition to reserves 
since june 1988 when travelers added 415 million to cover 
anticipated real estate losses the latest increase boosts reserves 
to 115 billion at quarters end 
travelers said it will post a net loss of 500 million in the 
quarter compared with net income of 94 million for the same 
period last year the company also will have a net loss for the 
year budd said 
he said the onethird reduction in the quarterly dividend to 
save 100 million by the end of 1991 will allow the company to 
retain more earnings to support growth 
despite its losses in the real estate market the company said 
its main businesses continue to be strong 
budd said the company has made progress in restructuring its 
insurance operations generating cost improvements of nearly 200 
million in the past two years he said the company wrote a record 
13 billion in new business in the managed care and employee 
benefits area in 1989 
the company expects operating profits in the third quarter to 
surpass 1989 levels of 63 million and operating income for 1990 
to rise by about 25 percent above last year 
travelers stock fell sharply on the announcement closing down 
437 on the new york stock exchange to 1637 a share 
two top rating agencies also acted negatively both moodys 
investors service and standard amp poors corp said friday they had 
lowered their ratings on travelers debt because of continuing 
problems in the commercial mortgage and real estate markets 
moodys said the addition to reserves combined with previous 
writedowns of mortgage assets would give the company a cushion to 
absorb any increases in nonperforming assets over the next few 
years 
the companys decision to reduce its common stockholder 
dividend and its conservative financial leverage will provide the 
company with greater financial flexibility enabling it to respond 
to this worsening environment moodys said 
about 1 billion of longterm debt was affected by the moodys 
downgrade standard amp poors actions affected about 649 million in 
debt

a federal judge friday again extended a freeze 
on payments to asbestos disease victims by the manville trust fund 
pending completion of a courtordered reorganization 
us district judge jack b weinstein said the monthlong 
extension was needed to finalize an agreement on a restructuring in 
which manville corp would inject up to 520 million over seven 
years to reverse a cash shortfall 
the shortage has jeopardized compensation payments to tens of 
thousands of victims the agreement to refinance the trust was 
announced last month the payments by manville would begin late 
next year 
it was the third monthlong extension by weinstein on the 
payments freeze which applies to all claims or court judgments 
made since the first order in august or until the new nov 6 
expiration date 
the trust was created in 1988 as part of manvilles bankruptcy 
court reorganization which was forced by mounting liability for 
lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases caused by 
asbestos 
under the freeze the trust is permitted to make payments for 
hardship claims and emergency health needs as well as operating 
expenses legal fees of trust attorneys and fees to a court adviser 
overseeing the restructuring 
the trust to date has settled close to 24000 claims for more 
than 1 billion from people made sick by inhaling asbestos fibers 
mostly during shipbuilding and other construction 
the trust faces 130000 more claims it cant meet weinstein 
ordered the reorganization after the trust said it was out of money 
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st 
century 
the reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the 
compensation scheme so that claims are processed based on victims 
health and financial need rather than when they file a claim
