a smoky fire touched off by a welders torch 
raced through a new casino under construction thursday at the 
riviera hotel and casino forcing the evacuation of at least 3000 
gamblers and guests 
only two minor injuries were reported in the 1020 am blaze 
which burned curtains and broke windows in up to 75 rooms in the 
hotel before being stopped by automatic sprinklers damage was 
estimated at about 35 million 
gamblers and guests were evacuated without incident when smoke 
began filling the inside of the resort the hotel patrons joined 
several thousand spectators on the strip watching the fire which 
was put out in about two hours 
the first thing we did was secure all of the money in the 
casino and evacuate all the people hotel president mark sterbens 
said to my knowledge its the first time weve ever shut down 
gambling at the riviera 
arthur waltzman riviera chairman said he went floor to floor 
with security officers knocking on doors to alert hotel guests as 
corridors filled with smoke 
everything worked the way it was supposed to work waltzman 
said of the hotels sprinkler and fire alarm systems 
the casino which suffered water damage reopened about 9 pm 
thursday and a performance by paul anka was delayed until 10 pm 
hotel officials invited all guests to a free prime rib buffet and 
offered them free tickets to ankas performance 
the fire blackened the exterior of a section of the original 
hotels ninestory structure built in 1953 the fire reached inside 
50 to 75 rooms in the building fire officials said before being 
stopped by automatic sprinklers 
the fire began in wooden forms being used to build a new 125000 
squarefoot twostory casino touted as the worlds largest the 
blaze also spread to the eaves of an existing casino area and burned 
part of an outdoor sign on the casino embers fanned by 25 mph winds 
also crossed the street and briefly set the roof of a motel on fire 
two other highrises at the riviera where most of the hotels 
rooms are located were not affected by the fire but were evacuated 
anyway 
clark county fire department spokesman bob leinbach said the 
blaze was touched off by welders who were building a swimming pool 
on top of the new casino leinbach said firefighters later found two 
empty fire extinguishers nearby 
sterbens said the hotels 2200 rooms were sold out the hotel is 
hosting a convention of the american association of spinal cord 
injury nurses and psychologists 
nevada enacted some of the most stringent fire safety codes in 
the nation after a fire at the former mgm grand hotel in november of 
1980 killed 87 people and a blaze at the las vegas hilton three 
months later killed eight people

hot springs has an army of silverhaired 
ambassadors who love to brag about mineral springs pure air and 
cheap living in the ouachita mountains 
when a prospective senior settler calls the greater hot springs 
chamber of commercerun retiree recruitment office coordinator gail 
ezelle unleashes the 150strong force of volunteers whose enthusiasm 
bubbles like this resorts hot spring water 
dapper in matching blue blazers breast pockets adorned with 
their names and the city logo the volunteers court potential new 
neighbors with answers about health care expenses and recreation 
they escort guests up the 216foot hot springs mountain tower for 
a panoramic view then head downtown for a look at restored 
bathhouse row the leisurely tour may end with a meal or maybe a 
sunset cruise aboard a lake hamilton party barge 
the personal pitches have been potent the office has fielded 
more than 6500 inquiries since it started advertising nationally 
last summer it takes credit for 75 moves part of its success comes 
from a 1987 randmcnally study listing hot sprngs as the nations 
third most desirable retirement spot after the murraykentucky 
lake ky and claytonclarksville ga areas 
to mrs ezelle 55 who moved from texas recruiting retirees is 
just like recruiting an industry they have such a tremendous 
economic impact on the community and they give us expertise and 
enthusiasm 
but retirees dont bring some of industrys bothersome baggage 
pollution clogged highways and fluctuating workforces they arrive 
with average assets of 215000 and average annual incomes of 
33000 along with taxes and spare time to devote to community 
activities that equates to an annual economic impact of more than 
9 million the office estimates 
mrs ezelle praises her volunteer corps who buy their own 
jackets pay for their own gas and provide any extras such as lake 
cruises or meals she offers a tollfree telephone line and 
complimentary passes to the mountain tower 
aggressive retiree recruitment is nothing new but hot springs is 
innovating by applying the concept to an existing city instead of a 
carefully planned senior citizens development said aging expert 
charles f longino jr 
arkansas has been a nice place for people to retire for a long 
time so they have a tradition up there said longino associate 
director of the center for adult development and aging at the 
university of miami 
but the difference with hot springs is they are really going 
after the retirees instead of letting the retirees come to them 
states have to kind of compete for retirees they bring expendable 
income and lots of advantages and older people rarely move 
someplace where they dont know anybody 
thats why volunteers like dick and marge bingham are valuable 
they know what its like to downshift from a fastpaced working 
lifestyle 
the binghams moved to hot springs in 1987 from covina calif 
their home for more than three decades dick 57 knew it was time 
to get out when his 28minute commute to a securities office turned 
into a 1hour headache 
they were familiar with arkansas because their daughter and 
grandchildren live in mena on the states western edge a deal on a 
lake house clinched the decision and once dick unwound after three 
months of relaxation he decided to tell others about hot springs 
marge 53 says she was floored by friendliness out in 
california it was so huge and impersonal we maybe knew our 
neighbors across the street and on either side of us but here 
weve already got 50 to 100 close friends and 500 speaking 
acquaintances i love it 
dick bingham likes to end a recruiting session by inviting guests 
onto his party barge docked a few yards behind his home on lake 
hamilton he doffs the blazer kicks back and steers the vessel 
toward the setting sun 
marge waves to a passing dinner cruise boat two dozen strangers 
wave back see what i mean everybodys friendly heck in 
california if a guy raises his hand like that he may have a gun in 
it 
the office generally refrains from bashing other states but 
proudly displayed is a map showing states generating the most 
inquiries this year shaded in blue in descending order they are 
california 400 calls illinois 314 new york 291 texas 265 
and florida 221

japans most eligible bachelor crown prince 
naruhito is looking for a bride but the heir to the chrysanthemum 
throne has discovered its not easy finding a woman both willing and 
suited to marry into the worlds oldest royal family 
four years ago upon his return from postgraduate history studies 
at oxford universitys merton college the prince said he would like 
to marry by age 30 a milestone he reaches in february 
but few palace watchers expect the prince to achieve that goal 
despite his obvious assets hes the eldest son of emperor akihito 
has an excellent education and enjoys foreign travel 
women who appreciate culture might be interested in knowing he 
plays the viola for sporty types the prince is an avid mountain 
climber and enjoys tennis 
we are trying to realize his marriage as soon as possible 
but have not yet reached the point where we can speak of any 
particulars iwao miyao deputy head of the imperial household 
agency told a parliamentary committee aug 29 
miyaos comment on naruhitos nuptial difficulties was prompted 
by news a few days earlier that prince aya naruhitos younger 
brother was engaged and likely to marry first 
the idea of 23yearold aya second in line to the throne 
marrying before his elder brother was met with considerable 
opposition from palace conservatives one palace source said 
but the crown prince seems to be in no hurry and hasnt found 
the right woman yet the source said requesting anonymity 
a formal palace announcement on ayas engagement will be made 
after it is approved by the 10member imperial council headed by 
prime minister toshiki kaifu it is scheduled to meet sept 12 
qualifications for women marrying into the imperial family have 
eased in recent years but candidates still can expect their family 
histories and personal backgrounds to be thoroughly checked by both 
the palace and the media 
newspapers dug up high school album photographs of kiko kawashima 
and even published diagrams of her family tree complete with 
detailed profiles going back four generations when it was discovered 
she will marry aya 
miss kawashima comes from a good but common family they said 
her father is a professor of economics at tokyos gakushuin 
university the alma mater of much of japans royalty she has lived 
in austria and the united states 
because naruhitos wife will become empress his choice will be 
subject to much closer scrutiny 
descendants of prewar nobility or daughters of leading 
industrialists are preferred in prospective princesses though these 
qualifications are not ironclad a clean bill of health however is 
a must as is japanese citizenship 
some experience living abroad or ability in a foreign language 
is also seen as a plus since members of the imperial household 
often are hosts to foreign dignitaries 
attention has focused on three women singled out by the media as 
possible mates for naruhito mari hatano 23 fluent in french and 
english and a student in geneva where she lives with her parents 
masako owada the 25yearold daughter of a diplomat and a student 
in england and teruko kuni 25 a cousin of the prince 
but many palace watchers suspect the princes final choice will 
come as a surprise 
the crown prince has a very clear idea of the kind of woman he 
wants to marry and he is too stubborn to just accept whomever the 
palace chooses which was how things used to be done said 
toshiaki kawahara a journalist who has written several books on 
japans imperial family 
kawahara said the traditionminded strictly regimented life of 
the japanese royal family has frightened away women reared in the 
relatively open atmosphere of modern japan 
before empress michiko married the emperor she had to go 
through hours of princess studies every day for three months he 
said and because she was not of noble heritage she had to endure 
a good deal of bullying from the old nobility her precedent may 
scare off other women who could marry into the imperial household 
michiko the daughter of a wealthy businessman is the first 
commoner to become empress of japan she wed akihito in 1959 when 
he was crown prince and is credited with shrinking the gap known as 
the chrysanthemum curtain between the public and palace

psychiatrists and psychologists at hartgrove 
hospital bristle at being called modernday exorcists but theyre 
creating one of the nations first treatment programs to wean 
teenagers from satanism 
in no way are we comparable to the old exorcists says 
michael weiss an adolescent psychologist at the north side 
hospital which plans to begin offering the program this month 
the kids who will be admitted will be here primarily because of 
their behavioral and emotional problems no one will be hospitalized 
for strange beliefs or unusual values that we would disagree with 
weiss said wednesday 
i dont think there is any doubt satanism is a growing 
problem said social worker dale trahan who has been researching 
satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted to organize the 
program for hartgroves new center for the treatment of ritualistic 
deviance 
we dont know the percentages because so much is secretive but 
we do know it is beginning to show up throughout the country 
trahan said 
more such programs will be needed as police teachers and parents 
learn to recognize involvement said jerry simandl a chicago police 
youth officer and expert on satanic cults who has helped train 
hartgrove staff 
thats been the problem there arent places to take the 
kids simandl said 
in the program teenagers will spend four to eight weeks as 
inpatients and undergo individual and group counseling most of the 
youths will be admitted voluntarily 
hartgroves facility to be staffed by specially trained 
psychiatrists psychologists social workers and nurses should 
receive its first patients in two to four weeks and initially will 
take as many as six patients at a time weiss said a similar 
program exists at denvers bethesda psychhealth 
the new program will seek to undermine satanisms underlying 
belief system which hampers conventional treatment 
satanism gives them the promise of power and privilege beyond 
anything they ever imagined not only can they have everything they 
want but can do so while totally indulging themselves in drugs 
sex or any momentary pleasure weiss said 
we try to help them see how unrealistic the promises are our 
ultimate goal is to make them able to function in the world so they 
can have a reasonable and successful life for themselves and not 
harm anyone else 
youngsters involved in satanism often exhibit unusual behavior 
which can include suicide attempts violent rages rejection of 
family drug use sexual promiscuity a drastic drop in grades 
intensified rebellion a strong interest in heavymetal music 
roleplaying games or horror films and the use of occult symbols 
such as 666 or upsidedown crosses trahan said 
they usually are intelligent creative and bored with 
traditional pursuits they generally have a feeling of being 
different and not belonging are often underachievers and generally 
have a feeling of being powerless he said 
one of the problems is helping people see and diagnose the 
problem trahan said often people with a little bit of 
knowledge think they see it everywhere and think if a kid is into 
heavymetal music he must be a satanist but thats not true

us assembly plants back in operation 
after winning a threeweek labor dispute have blazed the trail for 
other companies to fight the extraordinary power labor unions hold 
in mexico industry spokesmen say 
a union power struggle that shut down 15 american plants known as 
maquiladoras in the border city of reynosa ended with labor and 
government officials agreeing aug 18 to let the workers form a 
union independent of the nationally powerful mexican workers 
federation whose local representative forced the workers to strike 
it definitely means that companies can take a stand against 
illegal activities and corruption and be successsul said don 
king manager for reynosas west bend plant 
we blazed a new trail 
the strike was settled after intervention of president carlos 
salinas de gortaris government in mexico city 
salinas has made clear he will not let unions stand in the way of 
his goal of modernizing the mexican economy and attracting more 
foreign investors 
the salinas government has acted in a certain direction to 
remove as much of the corruption as it possibly can said arnold 
kezsbom president of the new yorkbased service manufacturing corp 
whose reynosa plant was closed in the strike 
he doesnt want to have the negative publicity that occurred 
out of this permeate throughout the world the issue was the 
expansion of the maquiladora industry in mexico 
maquiladoras in which foreignowned companies take advantage of 
cheap mexican labor to produce goods for sale in their own countries 
or elsewhere have become a top foreign income earner for mexico 
the industry which generated 23 billion in foreign currency 
last year has grown by more than 70 percent since 1985 and employs 
about 392000 people mainly along the usmexican border 
the strike cost an estimated 500000 a day in lost production 
but plant managers said it was worth it because the outcome was 
favorable to them 
although the plant workers indicated no great sympathy for a 
walkout they went on strike july 25 on the orders of rafael 
morales a local leader of the powerful mexican workers federation 
strike flags were hoisted traditionally in mexico workers who 
violate strike flags face severe consequences including possible 
physical harm immediately or later 
the plants nevertheless continued to pay the workers their 
wages and benefits averaging about 120 a hour during the strike 
kezsbom said the american managers resisted morales who controls 
most of the labor contracts at reynosas 27 other maquiladoras 
because they considered him corrupt 
morales forced companies to give him control of trucking 
contracts waste disposal and scrap resale and to issue food 
coupons good only at stores he controls the coupons are part of the 
employee benefit packages 
the nearly 2000 workers at the plants morales shut down waited 
for two weeks while plant managers and business leaders pleaded with 
the federal government in mexico city to step in 
then frustrated by government inaction about 900 workers ripped 
down the strike flags stormed back into their plants and went to 
work 
that same day interior secretary fernando gutierrez barrios met 
with industry leaders in mexico city and promised the government 
would intervene 
gov americo villarreal of tamaulipas summoned the managers to a 
meeting in the state capital ciudad victoria the next day to work 
out an accord giving the plant workers the right to form an 
independent union 
the agreement surprised those familiar with the strength of the 
mexican workers federation the nations largest labor organization 
and a powerful sector of the governing institutional revolutionary 
party 
although the agreement stipulates that only workers from the 
affected 15 plants can join the independent union industry 
spokesmen say it may open a new era of labor relations in tamaulipas 
and other mexican states with maquiladora plants

a spokesman for former philippine president 
ferdinand marcos quit his job and returned to manila on wednesday 
giving up his appeal for political asylum in the united states 
guillermo gemmo trinidad 45 was media spokesman since 
shortly after marcos was exiled here in february 1986 trinidad left 
honolulu for manila early wednesday after visiting his parents and 
son in los angeles 
trinidad entered the united states in march 1986 on a tourist 
visa 
after the immigration and naturalization service began 
deportation proceedings against him last january for overstaying the 
visa trinidad applied for political asylum claiming his life would 
be in danger in the philippines now that marcos foe corazon aquino 
is president 
a hearing on the appeal was scheduled for later this month 
although he still fears persecution trinidad said personal 
problems including a recent divorce prompted his decision to go 
home 
i believe the emotional problems caused by the divorce have 
caused me to be less effective as spokesman he said im still 
a bit apprehensive about what will greet me but if i get arrested 
it will help my colleagues 
several other marcos aides seek political asylum here 
trinidad was married in 1978 and divorced last january his 
exwife norma will remain in the united states as will their 
8yearold son juan reynaldo trinidad said 
tomas buddy gomez philippine consul general here called 
trinidads fears of persecution preposterous and said many 
marcos allies prosper in the philippines 
trinidad said he would work for an export company in manila as 
well as write a twicemonthly column for a filipino newspaper in los 
angeles hes also working on a book detailing his years with the 
marcoses 
near the end of marcos 20year rule trinidad was a regional 
director in the ministry of human settlements then headed by 
marcos wife imelda 
the marcoses are under us indictment for allegedly stealing 
nearly 200 million from their homeland and stashing it in the 
united states the us government has filed a companion civil 
lawsuit so that claims against them can continue if the 71yearold 
marcos dies he has been hospitalized here for the past eight months 
and remained in critical condition wednesday 
although mrs marcos has said the us and philippine 
governments freeze on many of the couples vast assets made it 
difficult to pay bills trinidad said he got a regular allowance 
and money played no part in his decision 
mrs marcos downplayed reports that trinidad left because of 
increasing tension between him and other members of the marcos 
entourage including ferdinand marcos jr 
gemmo is a good guy said mrs marcos he can always come 
back and he still has my trust 
his attorney ronald oldenburg said trinidad withdrew the 
application for political asylum tuesday and the ins granted him a 
voluntary departure order meaning the deportation proceedings would 
be suspended 
the ins said trinidad could apply for a new visa if he wants to 
return to the united states

the conviction of a billionaire drug kingpin 
whose arrest in his native honduras sparked a week of riots there is 
a big victory in the war on drugs federal prosecutors said 
jurors on wednesday found juan ramon matta ballesteros guilty of 
masterminding a california drug ring linked to a colombian cocaine 
cartel 
after the conviction us attorney gary feess described the 
45yearold matta as one of the most significant narcotics 
traffickers in the world today 
assistant us attorney jimmy gurule said the federal court 
jurys decision was a message to the colombian government that if 
they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the full 
extent of the law 
matta could be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility 
of parole feess said sentencing is scheduled for oct 5 
matta led a powerful cocaine cartel based in cali colombia that 
funneled thousands of pounds of the drug to arizona and southern 
california through mexico feess said 
he compared mattas power to that of carlos lehder rivas the 
colombian drug lord convicted earlier this year in miami 
the conviction of ballesteros is a major blow to the gangsters 
who run the international drug rings attorney general dick 
thornburgh said in a statement from washington 
the jury convicted matta on one count each of conspiracy running 
a continuing criminal enterprise and possession with intent to 
distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine 
mattas lawyer martin stolar said he will file motions to have 
the verdict overturned and failing that will appeal he insisted 
that the case was prejudiced by publicity surrounding the 
uscolombian antidrug campaign and president bushs speech 
tuesday night 
stolar said he asked bush to delay his address but received no 
response he maintained that matta was a legitimate businessman and 
honduras largest single employer he said mattas fortune came from 
cattle ranching construction and the tobacco coffee and spice 
trade 
the us drug enforcement administration however said matta 
controlled a narcotics empire worth up to 2 billion he was accused 
of overseeing a network that distributed 72 million worth of 
cocaine in los angeles 
the case against matta stemmed from a september 1981 raid on a 
van nuys apartment complex where 19 million in cash and 114 
pounds of cocaine were sezied at that time that was the largest 
seizure of cocaine in california history 
matta became a folk hero to his impoverished neighbors in 
honduras where he granted loans bought desks for school children 
and employed about 800 people on his tobacco and dairy farms his 
extradition triggered outrage in tegucigalpa where 2000 
demonstrators burned the us embassy annex five hondurans died in 
the weeklong violence

the governing party suffered 
its worst election setback in 41 years of power on wednesday losing 
nearly a quarter of its parliamentary seats to farright and 
antiapartheid rivals 
riot squads with whips tear gas and shotguns dispersed blacks 
protesting their exclusion from the balloting and police said more 
than 50 people were arrested antiapartheid leaders who called a 
general strike said 3 million people stayed away from jobs and 
classes 
it appeared with just four of 166 districts undecided that the 
national party would retain 93 or 94 of its previous 123 seats the 
farright conservative party improved from 22 to 39 seats and the 
liberal democratic party moved from 20 to 33 seats the most ever 
for an antiapartheid faction 
with his party narrowly retaining its majority in parliament 
national party leader and acting president fw de klerk is expected 
to be chosen by an electoral college next week to serve a fiveyear 
term as president 
he described the results as a clear mandate for his partys 
plans for gradual political reform and contended that both 
opposition parties had little chance for further growth 
independent commentators said it was the first time since 1953 
that the national party failed to get a majority of the popular 
vote the nationalists won about 48 percent of the vote to 31 
percent for the conservatives and 21 percent for the democrats 
about 69 percent of the 3160667 registered white voters turned 
out for the election 
the conservatives who favor stricter racial segregation lost by 
just five votes in vereeniging former district of de klerk who was 
not a parliamentary candidate 
foreign minister pik botha and defense minister magnus malan were 
reelected by margins sharply lower than in the white election of 
1987 the conservatives won their firstever seats in pretoria the 
capital and in cape province and the orange free state 
the election was widely viewed as among the most important in 
history for the whites who control south africa it gave white 
voters the choice of stating that they want to strengthen apartheid 
eliminate it or take a middle course 
the amount of support for the other parties was expected to 
influence the national party in deciding whether to speed up or slow 
down its program of limited political reform 
voting stations around the country were heavily guarded armored 
vehicles patrolled some mixedrace townships which were enveloped 
in smoke from burning street barricades 
also at stake were seats in mixedrace and indian chambers which 
were established in 1984 and have little power blacks who 
outnumber whites more than 51 have no voice in national affairs 
antiapartheid activists called for a boycott of the nonwhite 
elections 
of the nations 37 million people 5 million are white 28 
million black about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of 
indian descent 
the campaign platform of de klerk called for limited black 
participation at the national level within five years 
he is depicted as more flexible than his predecessor president 
pw botha but supports segregation of schools and neighborhoods 
and rejects a oneperson onevote system leading to black majority 
rule 
the conservative party opposes political concessions to blacks 
and favors comprehensive racial segregation the democratic party 
wants an immediate end to segregation and a vote of equal weight for 
every south african 
in the five weeks before the election antiapartheid groups 
mounted an unprecedented defiance campaign in many cases provoking 
violent response by police 
riot squads have used shotguns water cannons tear gas clubs 
and dogs against antielection marches campus rallies and church 
meetings more than 2000 people have been arrested for disobeying 
laws that segregate hospitals beaches and buses and for defying 
restrictions on speech and political activity 
desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop and antiapartheid 
leader said of the election im not paying a great deal of 
attention im more interested in how many people stay away 
i would hope that white south africans would be aware that the 
bulk of the people in this country are not voting and they should 
join us in getting rid of the system 
black worker absenteeism ranged from about 70 percent in the 
industrial heartland around pretoria and johannesburg to virtually 
100 percent in the eastern cape province cities of port elizabeth 
and uitenhage labor experts at johannesburgs university of the 
witwatersrand reported most mines operated normally but all motor 
vehicle plants were shut down 
officials said registered voters included 665870 indians and 
177 million people of mixed race

the addict slips the needle into his scarred 
arm and drives down the plunger or flares a crackfilled pipe and 
inhales the heated vapor 
in both cases the cocaine hits the brain within seconds giving 
the user sensations of pleasure that some have said is like no other 
high 
but the pleasure lasts only 10 to 20 minutes followed quickly by 
a crash and a relentless ignoreallelse craving to get high 
again 
its that cycle of ecstasy depression and renewed craving for 
euphoria that makes cocaine and crack among the most habitforming 
drugs and experts say medical science has not found a treatment 
that can be applied universally to break the cycle of dependency 
cocaine is clearly a very addictive drug because it is the most 
reinforcing and pleasurable of the abused drugs said dr jack 
blaine chief of the treatment branch at the national institute on 
drug abuse as yet we dont have any good solid research on 
successful crack or cocaine treatment 
both cocaine and crack a crystallized form of cocaine that is 
smoked work directly on the brain 
its believed the drug causes protein molecules called 
neuroreceptors to ignite sensations of pleasure and send pulses of 
euphoria along nerve pathways time after time after time 
eventually the molecules are absorbed and the effects diminish for 
the user theres a letdown and then quickly a desire for more of 
the drug 
that blaine said is a cycle of reinforcement that makes cocaine 
so dangerous 
by some estimates almost half of all cocaine users quickly slip 
from casual use into an uncontrolled craving and an even higher 
percentage of crack users quickly become addicts 
crack may be the most euphoric of all the drugs said dr 
herbert kleber a former yale researcher who is with the national 
drug control policy office 
it is intensely pleasurable it wears off very quickly and puts 
the user back to not feeling good and the body has no barrier to 
its use 
those who inhale powdered cocaine are limited by the amount the 
nose will absorb kleber said and those who inject the drug 
eventually run out of veins but the lungs have a virtually 
unlimited ability to absorb crack smoke he said 
success in treating addiction he said depends to a large degree 
on who is being treated 
some need only rehabilitation he said give me an employed 
professional and i will have 60 to 70 percent success in a year 
hell be off the drug 
but for addicts living in poverty particularly in the inner 
city there are few positive elements to provide an incentive to 
stay away from cocaine drugs in such neighborhoods often are viewed 
as an industry and an economic opportunity for the young to gain 
wealth quickly 
for those in the inner city you have to address not just the 
drug but the whole lifestyle kleber said first they have to 
be off the drug then they have to get the skills to stay off it 
that must include medical care housing education and vocational 
training 
and when they go back into the community theres got to be a 
strong support system a drugfree network to reinforce the new 
way of life he said 
meanwhile scientists are searching for a medication to help wean 
addicts from cocaine 
this is not an area yet where we have good clinical science 
said dr donald r jasinski chief of a chemical dependency clinic 
at francis scott key medical center which is affiliated with johns 
hopkins university medical school in baltimore 
finding a cocaine substitute he said is going to be very 
important in finding the best way to control cocaine 
within two or three years we should have a major medication to 
help us kleber said but i cant see any of these being a magic 
bullet that will automatically stop the craving or provide an 
effortless cure 
its not going to be that easy he said

a widely used class of fungicides is being 
taken off the market voluntarily for dozens of crops from apples 
to cucumbers because government tests indicate a higher risk of 
cancer than may be acceptable 
the three manufacturers of the fungicide ebdc announced wednesday 
they are curtailing the use of the chemical to maintain public 
confidence in the food products involved however they maintained 
the chemical is safe for consumers if used properly 
ebdc or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate has been under a special 
review by the environmental protection agency since 1987 because a 
breakdown product from the chemical has been shown to cause cancer 
in test animals 
the agency recently informed the companies of preliminary cancer 
risk estimates that likely would require curbs on the use of ebdc on 
some food products according to agency documents obtained by the 
associated press 
the fungicide has been used for nearly 40 years to combat mildew 
and mold on more than 70 different food crops including apples 
potatoes tomatoes sweet corn onions mushrooms carrots grapes 
lettuce and citrus fruits among others 
in a joint announcement the three manufacturers the du pont 
co pennwalt corp and rohm amp haas co said wednesday they will 
discontinue sales of the chemical for use on all but 13 food 
products 
the manufacturers maintained that use of the chemical if 
applied properly poses no health concerns but said the 
theoretical risks that are being reviewed by the epa in connection 
with use on some products unnecessarily raises questions about the 
safety of this entire class of fungicides 
such concerns have been heightened since the uproar earlier this 
year over the pesticide alar while the epa did not formally order 
alar off the market its link to cancer and the widespread publicity 
over its use on apples earlier this year caused the sale of apple 
products to plummet costing the apple industry tens of millions of 
dollars 
the manufacturer of alar subsequently stopped selling the 
pesticide in the united states to calm consumer fears 
epa spokesman john kasper confirmed that the agency is preparing 
to announce some curbs on the use of ebdc because of the latest 
cancer risk data on some food crops 
weve got some risk estimates that were concerned about 
said kasper he said the agency will review the voluntary withdrawal 
of the chemical for some foods and determine whether that is 
adequate 
but according to epa documents agency tests show that the 
cancer risks posed by ebdc residues on some foods were many times 
the one in 1 million level the agency uses to indicate negligible 
risk 
in the case of tomatoes the risk was found to be 63 times the 
oneinamillion risk level which the epa considers negligible for 
apples it was 150 times that benchmark according to the documents 
by comparison the epa estimated risk estimate for alar on 
applies earlier this yeas was 45 times the oneinamillion 
benchmark 
epa spokesman albert heier emphasized that the risk figures ebdc 
were preliminary and assumed crop residues at the maximum level of 
application according to manufacturers instructions 
the companies are conducting marketbasket studies to determine 
actual exposure to consumers since the chemical is known to decay 
with time and residues likely will be reduced through handling 
processing and washing 
although the manufacturers announcement named no food products 
an environmental group the natural resources defense council said 
the 13 crops for which ebdc will continue to be used include 
potatoes sugar beets sweet corn tomatoes and wheat and almonds 
janet hathaway an attorney for the environmental group called 
the voluntary withdrawal of the chemical from many food crops an 
unprecedented and responsible step in that it comes even before 
the epa has proposed curbs on the fungicides uses 
but ms hathaway maintained that the chemical continues to pose 
significant health risks in some of the foods for which it has not 
been withdrawn particularly foods like bananas grapes and 
potatoes which are consumed in large quantities by children

the evacuation of the last us diplomats 
from beirut marks a milestone in 30 years of american involvement in 
turbulent lebanon 
washingtons envoys had clung tenaciously to the warbattered 
capital despite the assassination of one us ambasador the suicide 
car bombings of two embassy buildings the abductions of americans 
and murderous artillery barrages 
but on wednesday ambassador john mccarthy and his 29 remaining 
american staff members slipped out of the country aboard three us 
navy helicopters amid mounting criticism from militant prowestern 
christians 
the christian standardbearer army commander gen michel aoun 
had charged that washington has sold lebanon to syria out of 
fear for the lives of eight americans held hostage by proiranian 
zealots 
but us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler angrily 
blamed the evacuation on aoun saying he had threatened to expose 
mccarthy and his staff to a good dose of christian terrorism 
she said that before the evacuation an unidentified telephone 
caller had threatened to shoot down a us helicopter that brought 
supplies to the hilltop embassy compound in east beiruts christian 
suburb of aukar 
aouns supporters besieged the embassy on tuesday and ms 
tutwiler said an unidentified leader of the protest had warned that 
embassy employees moved in and out of the premises at their own 
risk 
the protesters called off the siege hours after the evacuation 
it is the first time that an american ambassador has been pulled 
from beirut since lebanons civil war between moslems and christians 
began in 1975 
us officials were at pains to point out that american diplomats 
would return to the mediterranean country as soon as conditions 
permit but there was no sign that this would be any time soon 
observers in beirut said the american pullout would escalate the 
nearly 6monthold confrontation between aouns 20000 mainly 
christian troops and 40000 syrian soldiers based in lebanons 
moslem areas 
the fear is that the syrians could be encouraged by the us 
withdrawal to step up their military pressure on aouns forces in 
the besieged christian enclave north of beirut 
aouns troops have been locked in savage artillery duels with the 
syrians and their druse moslem allies since march 8 the battles 
have killed 828 people wounded 2455 and forced many of beiruts 
15 million residents to flee the city 
syria intervened in 1976 under an arab league mandate to stop the 
civil war but aoun who heads a christian military cabinet in 
lebanons splintered government contends the syrians betrayed their 
mission by supporting the moslems 
aoun declared a war of liberation march 14 to drive the 
syrians out they retaliated by blockading and ruthlessly shelling 
the christian enclave 
mccarthy whose mansion in suburban yarze was frequently hit by 
syrian shellfire has been outspokenly critical of syrias actions 
and repeatedly urged damascus to begin a dialogue with aoun 
but the 54yearold maronite catholic general said mccarthys 
behests were merely lip service and demanded full us 
recognition of him as the legitimate prime minister of lebanon 
mccarthy came to lebanon late in september 1988 but he did not 
present his credentials pending the election of a new head of state 
to succeed former president amin gemayel whose sixyear term 
expired that month 
mccarthys move was designed to avoid recognizing either aouns 
cabinet which was formed by gemayel minutes before he bowed out or 
that of acting prime minister salim hoss a sunni moslem 
the power struggle between the two cabinets has deepened the de 
facto partition of the country into sectarian ministates 
the evacuation of mccarthy and his staff was carried out with 
surgical precision two helicopters landed at the embassy compound 
at first light and took off with all 30 people within five minutes 
a third gunship flew cover witnesses reported 
nearly 540 lebanese guards and administrative employees were left 
in control of the embassy and of the ambassadors residence in yarze 
us involvement in lebanon began july 15 1958 when president 
dwight d eisenhower sent marines to beirut at the request of 
christian president camille chamoun to quell an uprising by 
chamouns moslem rivals 
civil war broke out in 1975 and the following year moslem 
radicals kidnapped and murdered us ambassador francis melloy along 
with his economic counselor robert waring 
with the war yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
became the dominant force in lebanons moslem areas that lasted 
until israel invaded in june 1982 
in august of that year 800 us marines part of a 5400man 
peacekeeping force with british french and italian units went 
ashore to oversee the evacuation of israeli syrian and plo forces 
from beirut 
the us force was later increased to 1800 men 
in april 1983 a shiite moslem suicide bomber rammed an 
explosivespacked van into the seaside us embassy in west beirut 
killing 63 people including 17 americans 
the worst was yet to come 
on oct 23 1983 another shiite suicide bomber attacked the us 
marine base near beirut airport killing 241 men and a second 
bomber attacked a french paratroopers base killing 58 men 
in december american reconnaisance planes were fired on and the 
united states responded with a naval fighterbomber attack that 
inflicted significant damage on syrian missile and artillery 
batteries in lebanon 
a few days later the battleship uss new jersey bombarded moslem 
positions with 250 shells from its 16inch guns 
but in february 1984 as the civil war erupted anew the marines 
were pulled back to warships off beirut a move that marked the 
beginning of their final withdrawal after a 22month peacekeeping 
operation in which 264 us servicemen were killed 
in september 1984 a suicide bomber hit the us embassy annex in 
christian east beirut killing 12 people and wounding 96 including 
the us ambassador it was this compound that was evacuated

americans who only occasionally see japanese 
kabuki theater may not find ennosukes kabuki as controversial as 
publicity before its appearances here and in washington has led them 
to expect 
except for some acrobatics quick costume changes and one exit on 
wires through the sky at wednesdays first of eight performances at 
the metropolitan opera ennosukes kabuki seemed largely to follow 
kabukis traditions such as stylized fights and poses held a moment 
to increase tension the troupe later will perform at kennedy center 
the most remarkable aspect of ennosukes kabuki is its leading 
actor ichikawa ennosuke iii who has organized this company of 36 
actors and 24 musicians 
two pieces are done at each performance which lasts three and a 
half hours longer than many americans wish an evening of theater to 
last 
the first is three acts from yoshitsune senbonzakura an 
eighthour sixact play which was first done in 1747 with puppets 
and adapted to kabuki the following year in it ennosuke plays two 
parts tadanobu a warrior faithful to a hero and a fox who has 
transformed himself to look like the warrior the fox did it the 
audience learns to be near tadanobus lover who has a drum made of 
the skin of his parents this illustrates fillial piety 
ennosuke who is 49 is young enough to jump up a flight of steps 
two at a time vault off the back of a porch and crawl under it 
emerging at the front in white fox fur but more remarkable than 
that is the difference in stance the actor has for tadanobu and for 
the fox as tadanobu when his hands subtly become paws and his head 
is held less militarily 
some kabuki companies strongest actors play young women 
however the actor playing tadanobus lover was simpering and whiney 
in the second play kurozuka ennosuke played an old woman 
actually a demon whose soul is soothed by a buddhist priest who 
says that even demons can find enlightenment ennosuke does a gentle 
dance in what looks like a corn field including deep breaths of 
relief 
then a comic character played by ennosukes younger brother 
blunders and ennosuke becomes a demon with red tongue and deep 
angry voice 
in other kabuki troupes visiting here older actors have made 
characters like the old woman more poignant but ennosukes old 
woman isnt superficial one would like to see his troupe again and 
him again as he deepens farther in conveying human emotion 
viewers could rent an apparatus to place in one ear for english 
summary and commentary while allowing the rise and fall of the 
japanese voices to be heard with the other ear

an energy department laboratory is under 
investigation for possible ethics violations in transferring 
sensitive computer technology to a new company led by former lab 
scientists who helped develop the process 
officials at lawrence livermore national laboratory on wednesday 
defended the licensing which is being investigated separately by 
the house energy and commerce investigations subcommittee and the 
energy departments office of inspector general 
we are satisfied that from all we know all was legal and above 
board said jeff garberson a spokesman at the livermore 
califbased laboratory managed by the university of california 
under an energy department contract 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house panel raised 
ethics and other questions about the licensing agreement in a letter 
to energy secretary james d watkins 
a copy of the july 7 letter was made available to the associated 
press on wednesday 
dingell called the awarding of a license to the company nchip 
for commercial development of the technology highly curious 
he cited the appearance of a conflict of interest in the 
granting of an exclusive license to a company whose top officials 
include at least three people who helped the lab develop the process 
laser pantography is used for interconnecting computer chips in a 
way that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a 
pack of cigarettes 
gordon longerbeam head of the labs technology transfers 
program said in a telephone interview that stringent measures were 
taken to ensure that the nchip licensing process was fair and legal 
no other companies expressed interest in getting the license 
until after the lab had signed a legally binding agreement with 
nchip to negotiate terms of the deal he said 
longerbeam said laser pantography was developed as part of a 
defense department electronics program but that it had no direct 
connection to work on the strategic defense initiative commonly 
known as star wars 
he said the technology was not classified but that some of its 
applications could be 
the exclusive licensing agreement with nchip was made in january 
and took effect in june 
three of nchips main officers are former lawrence livermore 
employees including a carl haussmann who was associate 
directoratlarge at the lab and had management responsibility for 
the laser pantography project until he left in april 1988 
haussmann is vice president for special projects at nchip 
the others previously involved in development of the technology 
are bruce mcwilliams nchip president and david tuckerman vice 
president of technology 
carol powell a spokeswoman at the energy departments san 
francisco field operations office which oversees work done at 
lawrence livermore said she could not comment because the case was 
under investigation by the inspector general 
ms powell confirmed that the investigation was requested by the 
san francisco office but she declined to say what prompted it 
judy demaire executive director of the inspector generals 
office said that as a matter of policy she could neither confirm 
nor deny the existence of any investigation 
an investigator on dingells subcommittee speaking on condition 
he not be identified said the panel had seen no sign of criminal 
activity in the licensing of the technology but he stressed that 
recent meetings with energy department and lab officials had not 
answered all questions about possible ethics violations 
among the issues raised by dingell was whether lawrence livermore 
had alerted other private companies that the technology was going to 
be made commercially available before choosing nchip for the 
license to develop it 
what were looking at is does this mean a person gets an unfair 
advantage in acquiring this technology just because he has a 
connection with a lab the subcommittee investigator said 
longerbeam said the technology was broadly communicated to 
segments and sectors of the electronics industry for several years 
before the agreement with nchip

senate majority leader george mitchell says 
president bush not the senate is responsible for the 200 vacancies 
still remaining in top policymaking positions in the bush 
administration 
bushs attempt to blame the senate for footdragging is 
unwarranted and unfair mitchell said 
in each of the 200 positions the president has not indicated 
that holdovers from the reagan administration will be asked to stay 
on the maine democrat told the senate on wednesday there are a 
total of 432 such jobs 
thus nearly eight months after he took office the president 
has failed to make nominations for nearly half of the fulltime 
positions in executive departments and independent agencies which 
require senate confirmation 
whose responsibility is that mitchell asked it is 
certainly not the senates 
mitchell noted that after he met with bush on aug 4 to discuss 
nominations white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
the president wanted to express his deep concern that these 
nominations were being held up for artificial reasons not related 
to the candidates themselves 
mitchell said that based on a careful review of the status of 
the bush nominations to date he is urging that the president 
discontinue such criticism 
it is unfounded and unfair mitchell said the principal 
problem is in the slow pace at which nominations are being made not 
in the pace at which nominations once made are being processed 
he said there are 48 policymaking positions in government 
departments that are totally vacant with no nominations 
submitted and no holdovers from the reagan administration 
out of 14 cabinet departments only the department of 
transportation has no totally vacant positions mitchell said 
there are five totally vacant positions in the executive office of 
the president and another 20 in major independent agencies 
in education he said there are no nominees to fill assistant 
secretary positions in elementary and secondary education or in 
vocational and adult education and civil rights 
in public health mitchell said there is no nominee for surgeon 
general commissioner of aging or for administrator of the health 
care finance administration 
the vital 1990 census is rapidly approaching and there is no 
nominee to be director of the census bureau mitchell said 
whose responsibility is that 
mitchell said the senate has confirmed 212 bush nominees 90 
percent of them within two months of the time the nominations was 
received he did not include nominations for us ambassadors us 
marshals or us attorneys 
he said a slowmotion nominating process is hurting the way the 
government functions because senior civil service professionals do 
not set policy for an administration 
when there are no people at the top the professional civil 
servant does the best he or she can but policy initiatives await 
the arrival of presidentially nominated personnel mitchell said

the government will seek the resumption of 
logging in western oregons oldgrowth forests an official said 
after a federal court lifted its ban on timbercutting in the 
northern spotted owls habitat 
conservationists who sued to prevent lumbering said that while 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals unanimous ruling wednesday 
removed the overall ban imposed june 7 it still permitted 
challenges to individual projects 
ed ciliberti the us bureau of land managements oregon 
spokesman said 66 million boardfeet of timber are ready for sale 
the injunction had forbidden timber sales within 21 miles of any 
spotted owl site identified by the bureau 
we are giving direction for our districts to begin moving those 
sales that have been enjoined ciliberti said 
if timber sales proceed conservationists will seek endangered 
species status for the owl said james monteith executive 
director of the oregon natural resources council 
the us fish and wildlife service has proposed threatened 
status for the bird a designation which would be weaker than that 
desired by conservationists 
the owl inhabits oldgrowth forests in western washington 
western oregon and northern california mostly on federal land 
scientists view it as a species whose condition indicates a forests 
overall health 
the threemember appeals court rejected conservation groups 
chief argument that new information on dangers to the owls survival 
was ignored by the blm in its environmental review the panel said 
the issue could not be raised in a lawsuit because of a federal law 
backed by the timber industry 
however the court revived sections of the lawsuit contending 
that destruction of owl habitat by logging violated federal bird 
protection law and federal and state landmanagement laws 
mark rutzick the lawyer for the timber industrys northwest 
forest resource council said the ruling offered the promise of 
final victory in the case for loggers and oregon communities that 
depend on logging 
victor sher of the sierra club legal defense fund the lead 
environmentalst attorney said its a disappointment but the 
fault is congress and not the courts we proved that the blm 
had violated the law but congress has said the courts cant hear 
the case 
the lawsuit challenged the blms refusal in 1987 to conduct a new 
environmental analysis of hundreds of planned timber sales in 
western oregon based on a new study increasing previous predictions 
of danger to the owl the bureau contended it already had taken 
adequate measures to protect the bird 
in may us district judge helen frye of portland dismissed the 
lawsuit allowing the blm to proceed with logging of 337 million 
boardfeet of timber she said the agency had failed to plan 
adequately for protection of the spotted owl but added that her 
hands were tied by federal law 
the appeals court agreed with fryes interpretation that the 
blms timber management plan could not be challenged in court on the 
basis of new information the law allowed challenges to particular 
activities in the plan 
in his opinion chief judge alfred goodwin said 
environmentalists challenge to numerous individual logging sales 
amounted to a challenge to the overall blm plan even if disputed 
sales added up to only 30 percent of the total 
the attacks on individual sales were based on a disagreement with 
the blms decision to designate certain areas for intensive timber 
management goodwin said 
that decision was made with the knowledge that owl habitat 
would be sacrificed in the clear cuts and conversion to 
secondgrowth forest he said that intentional tradeoff of 
owls for economic gain was precisely the landuse decision which is 
being challenged 
the court reinstated conservationists claims that the 
destruction of spotted owl habitat violated the migratory bird 
treaty act and federal oregon and california land management laws 
frye had dismissed those claims saying they should have been 
made while the blms timber plans were being developed but goodwin 
said environmental groups had acted as soon as they could after 
getting the new information about possible dangers to the owl 
the court ordered frye to consider the claims on their merits but 
did not impose a new injuction during that review

hundreds of striking eastern airlines 
employees ending a 3000mile march that began last month in miami 
want the senate to bring to a vote a measure to force resolution of 
the 6monthold walkout 
the 26day relay march which included rallies in a number of 
east coast cities ended wednesday on the west steps of the capitol 
amid chants of one more day 
the marchers were joined by union leaders and several members of 
congress 
were in a tough battle against one of the worst employers in 
the country aflcio president lane kirkland told the crowd 
we know which side the president of the united states is on 
hes made that abundantly clear said kirkland prompting marchers 
to chant where was george 
the strikers vowed to continue the walkout one more day until 
frank lorenzo owner of easterns parent company texas air corp 
gives in 
sen paul sarbanes dmd describing lorenzo as a modernday 
robber baron said the strikers were fighting for justice for 
all american workers 
rep john lewis dga donned a red shirt that urged a boycott 
of eastern and lorenzoowned continental airlines 
i believe frank lorenzo is vicious and greedy lewis said 
after the rally hundreds of pilots flight attendants and 
machinists paraded to the white house 
kirkland demanded that the senate bring to a vote a measure to 
force resolution of the strike the house approved such a bill after 
president bush refused to follow a national mediation board 
recommendation that he appoint an emergency board 
working men have to stick together said sen paul simon 
dill vowing to push for senate approval of the emergency 
legislation 
the rally came at the end of a march and caravan that began aug 
12 in miami leaders said 13 eastern employees traveled the entire 
route while hundreds of others participated in milelong relays of 
a symbolic picket sign along the east coast route that included new 
york and boston 
the striking unions accuse lorenzo of planning to strip away 
easterns assets until the airline is dead however eastern 
officials have said they are gradually building the airline back up 
to a major carrier and have been adding flights and personnel since 
filing for reorganization under bankruptcy laws

savings institutions representing 80 percent of 
the industry could fail new capital standards if regulators choose 
the strictest interpretation of legislation enacted last month 
under one interpretation of the bill signed into law aug 9 by 
president bush about 1400 of the nations 2700 solvent thrifts 
representing 1 trillion in assets or 80 percent of the industry 
would fall short regulators in the office of thrift supervision 
said wednesday 
however under a more lenient reading of the law only 600 
institutions with about 500 billion in assets would miss the 
standard and be subject to regulatory sanctions including 
restrictions on growth and government review of their business plans 
the key reform in the bill requires sampl owners to risk more of 
their own capital as a buffer between losses and government deposit 
insurance funds however sampl regulators said they were not sure 
exactly how tough the standard should be 
the problem according to m danny wall director of the thrift 
office is that the final bill was cobbled together from very 
different versions passed separately by the house and senate 
when you compromise widely divergent views you dont 
necessarily come up with something thats clear and thats what we 
have here he said 
one section of the bill the section that got the most attention 
during congressional debate establishes a new standard for 
core capital of 3 percent of loans and other assets 
however the sampl bill also requires thrifts to meet capital 
standards no less stringent than those adopted for national 
banks currently that is 55 percent 
further complicating the matter is the fact that national bank 
capital standards will be overhauled by 1991 in a way that varies 
required capital depending on the riskiness of an institutions 
loans and other investments 
regulators could impose very stringent standards on sampls only to 
wind up having to write more lenient rules a year later when the new 
riskadjusted bank standards for banks take effect sampls generally 
fare better than banks under riskadjusted rules because they 
concentrate heavily on mortgage lending which is considered safer 
than commercial lending 
regulators must resolve the dilemma by nov 7 when theyre due 
to publish capital rules taking effect a month later before that 
the office of thrift supervision which was once an independent 
agency called the federal home loan bank board must clear the new 
rules with the treasury department 
in deciding the issue wall said regulators are trying to figure 
out the intent of congress when it passed the bill but because 
different factions assigned different meanings to the same passages 
thats not easy 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said in a letter to treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
that congress intended the 3 percent standard to apply not the 55 
percent 
robert glauber under secretary of the treasury said gonzalezs 
letter was an important contribution to unsnarling the problem 
but he said a literal reading of the language of the bill 
leaves it open to a variety of interpretations i dont think 
theres a particularly persuasive case for one interpretation or 
another

plane crash survivors who were 
stranded in the amazon jungle for nearly two days said the pilot 
asked for their forgiveness and wished them luck as their jet 
crashed into dense vegetation 
we were ready to die but the hand of god guided our descent 
passenger epaminondas de sousa chaves 36 said wednesday after air 
force helicopters airlifted 41 survivors out of the jungle 
their varig airlines boeing 737200 crashed sunday night killing 
at least 10 of the 54 people aboard 
it is incredible that we came out alive said regia acevedo 
29 who was thrown from the plane with her husband raimundo 
air force spokesman col jose maria dos santos told a news 
conference that two passengers died wednesday and identified them as 
a man trapped in the wreckage and a woman who died on a rescue plane 
en route to brasilia 
the aircraft disappeared sunday night when the pilot reported 
problems with his navigational system and the plane strayed far off 
route 
chaves said the aircraft ran out of fuel and went down in thick 
forest cover 
with a calm voice the pilot asked us to forgive him and told 
us to pray to god and wished us luck all of a sudden the motors 
stopped and i dont know if 10 minutes went by 15 or even a 
minute chaves said 
he said the plane seemed to bounce when it hit the top of the 
100foot trees then smashed through the jungle cover in the 
northern part of the centralwestern amazon state of mato grosso 
both wings were ripped from the plane but the fuselage was nearly 
intact 
the plane bore a 300by120foot hole in the jungle but did not 
explode chavez said 
it was as if a giant claw had scratched the body of the plane 
first there was a deafening screech and then a silence and then 
absolute darkness ms acevedo said 
another passenger jose maria gadelha said all of a sudden 
there was a flash of lightning i lost consciousness and when i 
woke up i was outside the plane and alive 
the air force found the plane tuesday night after four survivors 
walked through the jungle and contaced authorities by ham radio 
on wednesday morning rescue helicopters airlifted 41 people 
nearly 30 miles to a ranch near sao jose do xingu about 1050 miles 
northwest of rio de janeiro santos said 
from the ranch three twinengine bandeirante planes took the 
survivors to the mountain serra do cachimbo air base 185 miles 
northwest there the survivors let their emotions go and wept was 
they were greeted by rescue workers 
they later were flown to brasilia the capital for care at the 
brasilia base hospital santos said 
the pilot of plane did not speak with reporters upon arriving in 
brasilia and airline officials declined further comment on what 
caused the crash 
the plane purchased by varig airlines in 1982 had strayed off 
course while on the last leg of a regularly scheduled flight between 
the southeastern city of sao paulo and belem 2140 miles northwest 
of rio at the mouth of the amazon river

the astronaut who will command 
atlantis next month on a mission to deploy a probe to jupiter says 
he has no qualms about flying with two nuclear generators aboard the 
shuttle 
the two radioisotope thermoelectric generators or rtgs will 
power the galileo probe on its trip across the solar system some 
antinuclear groups claim the nuclear material could pose a health 
hazard if released during a shuttle accident 
the chances are so remote its not worth worrying about 
atlantis commander don williams said wednesday 
williams and atlantis four other astronauts discussed the 
mission during individual interviews and at a final preflight press 
conference the crew will spend the next month training for the 
mission scheduled to begin oct 12 
theres a certain amount of risk involved in anything you do 
these days williams said but im satisfied in my mind 
that weve done the best possible job we can to make these things as 
safe as we possibly can 
atlantis other astronauts agreed 
i dont see how it can hurt anyone unless it hits him on the 
head and thats pretty remote said pilot mike mcculley 
the other crew members are franklin changdiaz ellen baker and 
shannon lucid all mission specialists baker and mcculley are 
space rookies 
each of the 122pound rtgs contain about 24 pounds of highly 
toxic plutonium238 dioxide the heat released by the plutoniums 
decay is converted into electricity by instruments called 
thermocouples 
the astronauts noted that the nuclear generators are the only 
known devices that can power a spacecraft going deep into the solar 
system far from the sun 
voyager 2 which last month relayed stunning photos from neptune 
is powered by similar rtgs 
if we want to explore the outer parts of the solar system we 
dont have a choice right now mrs baker said voyager wouldnt 
be where it is today and we wouldnt have gotten those beautiful 
pictures of neptune back had it not been for the three rtgs that 
have powered voyager so well for the last 12 years 
the united states has launched 22 nuclearpowered spacecraft 
since 1961 with all the plutonium packages encased in super 
hardened material designed to survive the worst possible fire or 
explosive conditions none resulted in the release of radioactive 
release even though one package was aboard a rocket that exploded 
and two survived flaming reentries through earths atmosphere after 
accidents 
but some antinuclear and environmental groups have protested the 
use of plutonium aboard atlantis citing the 1986 challenger 
explosion as an example of how things can go wrong they contend a 
similar explosion could result in radioactive contamination of the 
cape canaveral fla area 
the white house has to approve the mission because of the nuclear 
material aboard and an announcement is expected soon if the 
mission is approved opposition groups said they would seek a court 
order to block the liftoff 
nasa said an exhaustive postchallenger safety review indicates 
that the chances of a launch accident in which substantial 
quantities of plutonium pulverized to breathable form could be 
released is about 1in2700 and even then nasa said any 
contamination would be minor 
once deployed galileo will embark on a sixyear journey to 
jupiter where it will fire a scientific probe into the jovian 
atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of extensive 
exploration 
its just very exciting lucid said its important for us 
to learn its important for us to know about our solar system its 
important to learn about the universe were in

drug czar william bennetts suggestion that 
entertainers who reveal past addictions might lead others to abuse 
drugs was ridiculed by some celebrities 
bennett is an embarrassment to the american people said 
danny goldberg producer of the groundbreaking television campaign 
rock against drugs which featured popular musicians such as belinda 
carlisle and vince neil talking about their own drug addiction 
recoveries 
in the national drug control strategy report issued this week 
bennett praised campaigns that encourage negative attitudes toward 
drugs and that label drug users as losers 
less useful and probably even counterproductive are 
commercials in which sports and pop music stars who are reformed 
drug users tell young people not to do as they have done bennett 
also said 
such commercials may lack credibility and they also carry an 
unintended message that you can do drugs and still be rich and 
successful 
actor gregory harrison who has made public service announcements 
on television and radio discussing his eightyear addiction to 
cocaine and alcohol said that bennetts criticism was misguided 
im just out here to try to educate and i think most of the 
celebrities who do these things are there to help educate said 
the former star of trapper john md now sober for two years 
if william bennett thinks that its a mistake he can think 
that but id like to see him do something constructive instead of 
just critiquing other peoples attempts harrison said 
atlanta braves outfielder lonnie smith a recovering cocaine 
addict who has discussed openly his habits costly toll simply 
laughed and shook his head when asked to respond to bennetts 
comments william bennett is entitled to his opinion is all 
smith would say 
goldberg who brought the rock against drugs campaign to national 
television in 1987 said rads tv spots were useful because they 
employed former addicts steering users toward sobriety a tactic 
shared by alcoholics anonymous and cocaine anonymous 
there was no question that the people with the greatest 
credibility with young people were people who had grappled with the 
same demons that were assaulting the teenage fans goldberg said 
i think that rock stars are people that young people could 
understand he said 
in one of the rad spots former sex pistols guitarist steve jones 
said a good friend of mine sid vicious died of drugs i nearly 
died from drugs drugs suck 
another spot featured david crosby formerly of crosby stills 
nash and young crosby said four things can happen to you if you 
do drugs you can go crazy you can go to prison you can die or 
you can quit 
goldberg reported that one fan wrote to rad participant and 
heavymetal rocker ronnie dio to say teachers can preach for 
hours about how bad drugs are and i still went out and got high but 
man once i heard you say how stupid drugs are i never touched them 
again 
harrison said that the just say no antidrug rhetoric favored 
by former first lady nancy reagan is essentially useless 
if some guy whos never done drugs in his life never had a 
drug problem comes on and does a just say no commercial i 
watch that and i think you ignorant fools dont you understand 
how much worse it is than that 
if i could just say no and walk away id have done it five 
years ago he said people who just say no dont have the 
problem they have no credibility at all and its infuriating

the department of housing and urban development 
will revive with significant reforms a housing insurance program 
that has cost the government millions because of defaults blamed on 
mismanagement agency officials say 
the revised multifamily housing coinsurance program will 
include tighter eligibility requirements for lenders and an expanded 
monitoring effort by hud the officials who spoke on condition they 
not be identified said wednesday 
hud secretary jack kemp suspended the program four months ago 
ordering a review of its management kemp was to announce plans to 
renew the program wednesday but delayed it because of unresolved 
issues dealing with new regulations one of the officials said 
the officials said staff members would be added to monitor the 
lenders and the program would be upgraded from a branch of the 
departments housing division to a separate office under the 
assistant secretary for housing 
the program was a major part of the reagan administrations 
effort to turn government tasks over to the private sector 
under the program hud insures up to about 80 percent of 
mortgages for multifamily housing projects against default 
defaults in the program total more than 700 million with 
washingtonbased drg funding accounting for 583 million of the 
total 
huds inspector general in a critical review of the program 
said lenders appeared to be overvaluing property to issue inflated 
mortgages that would bring them higher fees because they receive a 
percentage of the loan amount 
kemp suspended the program three months ago one of a number of 
hud programs halted or put on hold amid reports of widespread 
mismanagement fraud and influencepeddling at the agency under the 
reagan administration 
since kemp took over the agency in february nine companies have 
been suspended from the program or placed on probation

the chairman of stroh brewery co says the 
company is withdrawing its sponsorship of national audubon society 
television specials but insists it has nothing to do with a 
threatened boycott by northwest loggers 
we sought to keep these issues separate and unrelated peter 
stroh said in a statement adding the decision reflected the 
detroitbased companys mounting financial problems 
northwest loggers upset with an upcoming program on the regions 
ancient forests began a loosely organized campaign threatening to 
boycott the brewerys products unless stroh dropped its support for 
the specials 
environmental sources who asked to remain anonymous had earlier 
said that stroh requested that changes be made in the program 
ancient forests rage over trees and when the audubon society 
refused the company decided to drop its 600000 in underwriting 
the timber industry and environmentalists have been locked in a 
bitter struggle for months over future logging in the northwests 
oldgrowth forests which provide prime habitat for the northern 
spotted owl 
the audubon society is among environmental groups that have 
sought to have the owl protected and logging in the ancient forests 
halted audubon officials insist that the special which will be 
shown on cable television sept 24 and on public television later 
is fair and balanced 
stroh has provided about half the funding for the fourshow 
series with the balance coming from turner broadcasting system 
turner spokeswoman kirsten white said wednesday that her company

budget cuts are hampering the governments 
ability to prevent major great lakes oil spills and to minimize the 
damage if they occur experts say 
the oil industry meanwhile underestimates the threat to the 
lakes as it prepares to open emergency response centers along the 
nations sea coasts but none on lake shores witnesses told the 
governmental affairs subcommittee on oversight of government 
management 
the panel chaired by sen carl levin dmich is investigating 
the dangers posed by spills into the lakes in the wake of the march 
24 exxon valdez disaster off the alaskan coast 
at a hearing wednesday speakers said the ramifications of a 
comparable spill on the lakes would be economically devastating 
the great lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than most 
people realize and there are far more inadequacies in our spill 
response and prevention capabilities than we can or should 
tolerate levin said 
none of the five emergency response centers envisioned by the oil 
industry is close enough to contain a major spill on the lakes said 
david f hales director of the michigan department of natural 
resources 
in a written statement the american petroleum institute said its 
new york response office would handle great lakes spills 
equipment from the center could be rapidly airlifted to any 
great lakes port the statement said 
the us and canadian coast guards reported 492 oil and chemical 
spills into the lakes in 1988 there were 384 reported spills in 
1987 and 401 in 1986

the leader of a us team hoping to solve the 
52yearold mystery of where amelia earhart crashed said today he 
believes her plane went down on an uninhabited island and she died 
of thirst three days later 
we wouldnt be going through this exercise if we didnt think 
there was something there said richard gillespie head of the 
international group of historic aircraft recovery 
the group based in wilmington del believes earharts plane 
crashed on the phoenix island of nikumaroro in the kiribati 
archipelago about 1000 miles east of fiji in the south pacific 
gillespie said a 16member expedition will leave suva on monday 
in a converted japanese trawler and spend three weeks on nikumaroro 
and nearby mckean island looking for evidence 
earharts plane disappeared in 1937 after she set off for howland 
island from wau papau new guinea to attempt the first 
transpacific flight the famed aviators exploits achieved 
legendary status in the united states 
we do not claim to have new and revolutionary information or 
new and revolutionary technology gillespie said in a telephone 
interview we have applied rigid academic techniques to solving 
the earhart enigma 
us embassy official robert benzinger said wednesday that 
gillespies group had fairly persuasive evidence that earhart 
went down much further eastward than previously thought 
they have two basic theories about where earhart crashed and 
if they find the evidence it will be sensational he said 
gillespies group searched old us navy records to produce the 
theory that earhart running short of fuel dumped her plane on 
nikumaroro which was on her flight path to howland island 
howland lies north of the phoenix islands and has an airstrip 
that earhart had planned to use for refueling before going on to 
hawaii 
we know for a fact she did not arrive at howland island because 
people were there waiting for her gillespie said we know for a 
fact how fast her plane was going and how much fuel she had on 
board when she sent a distress signal she was about 100 miles from 
howland 
it would be logical for her navigator to put down on the 
nearest bit of land and that would have to be nikumaroro or mckean 
since she was lost 
gillespie said the us coast guard picked up 24 distress signals 
for three days after the crash 
they heard a faint womans voice which people recognized as 
earharts it was on her frequency and her call sign he said 
the us navy launched a search and sent a battleship but because 
the waters were not well charted it did not put a landing boat 
ashore on nikumaroro 
gillespie said a pilot flew over nikumaroro in an ensuing aerial 
search and reported recent signs of human habitation 
he said he believed earhart died of thirst three days after the 
crash because nikumaroro has no fresh water and is uninhabited 
the island also known as gardener is a rim of land a 
quartermile wide situated around a vshaped lagoon mckean also 
uninhabited is a halfmile long and about 800 yards wide 
the expedition expects to arrive on nikumaroro around sept 16 
and gillespie said he expects to know whether the mission is a 
success before oct 12 
we hope to find the plane or bits of it it may have been swept 
away in a hurricane and thats why some members of the team are 
experts in sonar and metal detection he said 
he said the expedition will cost 250000 benzinger said the 
government of kiribati a group of 33 islands straddling the 
equator gave permission for the expedition 
kiribati formerly the gilbert and ellice islands was a major 
battleground during world war ii and has a population of about 
61000 
an australian woman pilot gaby kennard is attempting to fly 
solo around the world in a singleengine plane as a tribute to 
earhart 
kennard 44 flew this week to atchison kan earharts 
hometown she is a member of the 99 association of women pilots 
which earhart founded 
she expects to complete the journey to australia via europe the 
middle east and asia later this month

a 33yearold quadriplegic quietly accepted the 
news that a judge had granted his wish to be allowed to shut off the 
machine that has kept him alive the past four years 
larry mcafee paralyzed from the neck down in a 1985 motorcycle 
accident won permission wednesday to fit the ventilator that allows 
him to breathe with a device he designed in his head as he lay 
paralyzed 
he said well and was quiet just said well good said 
nurse carol philpot at the briarcliff nursing center in alabaster 
ala where mcafee is staying hes kind of digesting the news i 
think 
under his plans mcafee would be administered a sedative and use 
a mouthheld stick to activate the device which would be connected 
to a timer to shut off the ventilator 
fulton county superior court judge edward johnson ruled that 
mcafees right to refuse lifesustaining treatment outweighed the 
states interest in preserving life 
as a competent adult mcafee has the right to refuse medical 
treatment the judge said 
the ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his 
life it is prolonging his death said johnson who had 
jurisdiction because mcafee is from atlanta and had petitioned the 
georgia court before he was taken to the alabama nursing home 
mcafee asked the courts permission to shield anyone who helped 
him from potential legal problems 
johnson told mcafees parents and three adult sisters that the 
ruling would set a precedent so families in similar situations could 
make their decisions more privately 
in that way the judge said larry will have made his last and 
greatest contribution to his communityi have never met anyone who 
had a stronger impact on my own life than he had on me when we had 
the hearing at the hospital 
although most righttodie cases involve comatose patients or 
those who cannot make their wishes known a case similar to mcafees 
came up in july a 38yearold michigan man paralyzed in a surfing 
accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his 
lifesupport system shut off 
johnson ordered the state which supported mcafees petition to 
appeal to the georgia supreme court but said mcafee need not await 
the outcome 
mcafees lawyer randall h davis said he didnt expect any 
opposition 
the judge hopes they will issue a definitive opinion to make it 
so that similarly situated people wont have to go to court and go 
through all this davis said 
davis was unsure when mcafee would ask to be sent back to georgia 
so he could disconnect the ventilator he said his client wanted to 
be sent to a friends apartment instead of a hospital 
he has expressed a desire all along to move this along as 
quickly as possible davis said i assume that continues to be 
his desire 
mcafee had not arranged to be moved to georgia yet but the 
alabama nursing home officials would expedite a move to wherever 
mcafee wished said richard lazarnick a spokesman for the home 
johnson conducted a hearing at mcafees bedside last month 
hearing him testify that he wakes up just fearful of each new day 
there is nothing i have found or can think of that i really enjoy or 
that has helped me or my situation 
a petition filed last month included an affidavit that stated 
i understand turning off the ventilator will result in my death 
and was signed by a shaky x made with a pencil held in mcafees 
mouth 
five family members and a family friend testified that mcafee 
told them numerous times he wanted to die rather than continue 
living as he is 
julie orr a sister said after the ruling that the family was 
simply glad it was over 
its what larry wants she said you never know how hard 
it is until youre put there

tougher prison sentences more treatment 
more prison cells more judges more police and more money 
president bushs 1989 national war on drugs no nelson 
rockefellers 1973 new york war on drugs 
calling for an end to a reign of terror the thengovernor 
told the legislature in early 1973 
what is needed now is a truly effective deterrent to the 
pushing of drugs so that innocent people will not fall victim to the 
pushers tactics or be robbed mugged or murdered by him 
with that rockefeller proposed mandatory life sentences for drug 
dealers 
the late new york republican who went on to become vice 
president also asked for 100 new judges and more than 6000 new 
prison cells 
he got the money for those and for 30000 new drugtreatment 
spaces and with some modification to make the proposal less 
draconian rockefeller got stiff mandatory prison sentences for 
pushers he even got approval for a 1000 bounty to those who 
turned in drug dealers 
new yorkers got a bill that year for an extra 67 million 
rockefeller having largely failed with earlier programs for 
voluntary and then mandatory drug treatment was trying what he 
called the toughest drug law in the nation 
when are we going to open the concentration camps democratic 
state sen manfred ohrenstein asked at the time he and others 
predicted failure 
in fact after a brief decline felony drug arrests were on the 
rise again by late 1974 in new york 
state officials reported last month that new york citys violent 
crime rate linked largely to drugrelated cases rose by 98 
percent in 1988 
it didnt make a goddamn dent on anything ohrenstein said 
this week of rockefellers war on drugs 
ohrenstein who now serves as senate minority leader said he 
views the bush drug offensive in much the same light 
each time we were deceiving the american public said 
ohrenstein i think we keep trying without trying to face up to 
what really is the problem whats wrong with us that there are 
so many people who need a fix every day 
noting that the state had pumped million of dollars into 
education and treatment programs during the 1960s with little 
success before moving to tough punishment in 1973 thenrepublican 
assemblyman dominick dicarlo said the gettough policy failed 
because it was simply too tough 
dicarlo now a judge on the us court of international trade 
also complained of the approach used in new york 
we would concentrate on one aspect at a time said dicarlo 
who joined the reagan administration in 1981 as the state 
departments assistant secretary for international narcotics 
control hopefully what the president is doing now is 
concentrating on the entire area 
republican warren anderson who had just taken over as senate 
majority leader the year rockefellers tough antidrug laws were 
adopted also hopes bushs move to attack the drug problem on all 
fronts at once may make it more successful than rockefellers 
approach 
we tried so many different things said anderson who retired 
from the legislature last year after 16 years as the senate leader 
here we are 17 years later and if anything the conditions are 
worse i dont think you can say it rockefellers program was a 
failure but it wasnt a success either 
even democrat ohrenstein said the rockefeller approach wasnt a 
complete miscalculation 
to what degree did it hold back the tide for a little while or 
staunch the flow of blood for a little while its hard to say he 
said should we not have tried at all the answer is we should 
have tried 
the rockefellerera drug laws have since been eased in new york 
state former gov hugh carey and current gov mario cuomo both 
democrats have granted clemency to some drug dealers given 
mandatory life sentences under the rockefeller drug laws

dutch voters have overwhelmingly 
endorsed premier ruud lubbers economic recovery program and given 
notice that cleaning up the nations heavily polluted environment is 
a priority 
in wednesdays general election lubbers christian democratic 
appeal party maintained its 54 seats in the 150member parliament 
remaining the bodys largest single party 
traditionally the largest legislative grouping gets the 
premiership and lubbers the countrys longestserving premier in 30 
years seemed certain of a third term 
voters dealt a blow to lubbers errant junior partner in the 
centerright coalition the rightwing liberals who in may toppled 
the government over how to finance a longterm cleanup of the 
environment 
the liberals perceived by many voters as antienvironmentalist 
lost five of their 27 seats on wednesday 
the opposition labor party lost three seats in the voting 
keeping 49 
it remained the secondlargest force in parliament but failed to 
rally the leftofcenter vote around its platform of economic growth 
and redistribution of wealth among the 3 million people living on 
welfare outlays 
the green left an impromptu coalition of leftwing fringe 
parties doubled its parliamentary contingent wednesday to six seats 
and the traditionally environmentalist democrats 66 party won 12 
seats a gain of three 
the remainder of seats went to small rightwing fringe parties 
the electoral blow to the liberals and the surge in support for 
green parties clearly indicated voter concern over ecological issues 
earlier this year lubbers government adopted a farreaching 
multibilliondollar plan to clean up the environment in this nation 
that has been dubbed the garbage can of western europe the 
country is located on the estuary of the rhine europes prime 
industrial waste artery 
but the liberals under pressure from its affluent constituency 
rejected the proposed abolition of a tax break for car commuters 
the revenue was to finance the 33 billion cleanup over the next 
four years 
the governing coalition that will now emerge is difficult to 
predict and building it is expected to take months lubbers said 
wednesday that it was possible to form a coalition with either the 
right or the left 
aske whether he would accept the liberals as future coalition 
partners lubber said he shouldnt exclude any party beforehand 
but he also told dutch television i see no reason why we 
couldnt get together with the labor party despite major 
differences over government austerity and industrial revitalization 
a continued alliance between the christian democrats and the 
liberals favored by the predominant part of both parties 
constituencies appears less likely because such a coupling would 
have just a oneseat majority 
but hammering out a centerleft coalition of christian democrats 
and labor would be difficult because of the wide chasm on pressing 
issues 
most prominent among them was how much those on welfare would 
share wealth generated by an economy that has recovered partly by 
slashing social security outlays 
other divisive issues included defense with labor opposed to 
modernizing natos nuclear arsenals and the christian democrats in 
favor and euthanasia which lubbers party wants to ban and labor 
wants to legalize 
the christian democrats strong showing proved overwhelming voter 
support for lubbers policy of economic austerity and fiscal reform 
the economy is expanding at a healthy 25 percent annual clip up 
from near zero when lubbers rose to power seven years ago consumer 
spending is growing 225 percent yearly compared to minus 10 
percent earlier in the decade 
lubbers has scheduled income tax cuts of 18 billion annually 
beginning next year

sir rudolf bings marriage has been annulled but 
his lawyer says that comes too late for the former opera impresario 
to finish his life in his own home 
state judge carmen ciparick on wednesday granted the invalidation 
over the objections of carroll douglass ending a 33month union 
during which attorneys for both said the pair had lost touch with 
reality 
as the case proceeded the 87yearold bing who suffers from 
alzheimers disease was moved from the fashionable essex house 
hotel along central park to a nursing home 
in 1985 he came to a 30year friend and said the one thing i 
really want is to stay in the essex house and die there said 
bings lawyer paul goldhamer but we ran out of money and time 
goldhamer said hiring security and nurses to protect bing from 
ms douglass took up 400000 to 450000 of bings 600000 estate 
whats left is mostly paintings 
its truly a tragic event goldhamer said 
the judge denied alimony or any part of bings estate to ms 
douglass 50 who is hospitalized in a mental ward of bellevue 
hospital said her lawyer harvey sladkus 
ciparick ordered bings estate to pay the expenses for ms 
douglass hospitalization for mental problems last summer sladkus 
said 
ms douglass sister and brother in washington will confer on the 
next legal move sladkus said 
ms douglass who had a history of mental problems was 
hospitalized in august 1988 after she lost touch with reality 
he said 
bings legal guardian paul c guth was on vacation and 
unavailable for comment bings first marriage lasted 54 years but 
ended in divorce 
bing and douglass married jan 9 1987 in a civil ceremony in 
arlington va attorneys for bing the general manager of the 
metropolitan opera for 22 years claimed he was mentally incompetent

the rev george a stallings jr is denying 
published reports that he had sex with an altar boy 12 years ago 
read my lips i am innocent stallings declared on cnns 
larry king show on wednesday 
the washington post reported monday that stallings who recently 
started a controversial africanamerican catholic congregation 
allegedly had oral sex two or three times a week with an altar boy 
in a washington church rectory for several months in 1977 
stallings accuser who was then 16 years old gave the newspaper 
a signed statement saying the incident occurred saying he never 
reported the relationship to church authorities the paper agreed 
not to identify the man 
a caller asked stallings on the live show wednesday night if he 
was considering a lawsuit against the newspaper 
in order to sue the washington post it would take between 
75000 and a 1000000 the priest responded i have already 
sought legal counsel about this matter 
stallings 41 had previously denounced the newspapers reports 
saying he would not dignify the scurrilous and baseless charge 
with a answer but had not denied the charge 
washington post reporter bill dedman who cowrote the article 
was a caller on the show and asked stallings if he has ever had 
sexual relations with the young man in question or with any man 
bill dedman i said i wouldnt respond to you at all 
stallings said i told him i do not deal with sleaze reporters and 
journalists and i wont talk to him stallings threatened to walk 
off the set if pressed to answer dedmans question 
another caller asked stallings if he would agree to take 
polygraph test to prove his innocence 
are you asking all the cardinals the priests and the bishops 
of the catholic church to take a polygraph test stallings said 
when you can ask that of every priest bishop and cardinal then 
you can ask me 
the black priest defied roman catholic hierarchy by forming an 
independent church that blends tradition catholic liturgy with 
african and gospel traditions in july 
cardinal james a hickey the washington archbishop suspended 
stallings following the first unauthorized mass at imani temple 
in a statement released monday hickey said he was sorry to 
read the allegations and felt great sorrow and sympathy if they 
were true 
an unidentified person allegedly wrote hickey three years ago 
claiming that stallings had a sexual relationship with a male family 
member the post reported that letter prompted a formal 
investigation but the inquiry ended after the person refused to 
talk unnamed sources said

the dollar inched up against the yen today while 
share prices on the tokyo stock exchange declined for the third 
consecutive day 
the dollar closed at 14687 up 022 yen from wednesdays close 
the currency opened at 14620 yen 045 yen lower than the previous 
days close of 14665 yen but the dollar soared to 14705 yen 
during afternoon trading before easing down to the days close 
currency dealers said market participants were waiting on the 
sidelines on speculation that the west german central bank would 
raise key interest rates to drive the dollar lower later in the day 
they said the speculation caused the west german mark to rise 
against the dollar depressing the relative value of the us 
currency against other currencies including the yen 
when there is such speculation swirling around the market it 
is hard to buy the dollar though i believe the dollar is still quite 
bullish said a dealer with daiichi kangyo bank speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the dealer also said many market participants share the view that 
the dollar has been rising too fast and that led to easing of the 
dollar today 
traders are keeping their eyes on central banks 
intervention he said 
but another dealer with the bank of tokyo said the dollar is 
expected to remain bullish for some time because of the strength of 
the us economy 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which lost 17064 points wednesday fell another 11875 
points or 035 percent to close at 3415256 
securities dealers attributed the bearishness of the stock market 
to unstable exchange rates and the weakness of the yen 
many investors are sidelined until the instability of exchange 
rates settles down said a dealer at nikko securities speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
he added that buying incentives are increasing in the market 
though the nikkei average is not improving yet he said 
the volume traded on the first section of the exchange where 
most major shares are listed was estimated at a moderate 600

when public school students returned to 
class there was something else beyond the usual change of new 
classes new teachers and new books there also was a new 
administration run by boston university 
after months of sometimes bitter controversy the private 
university was at the helm of the chelsea public school system it 
is the beginning of a 10year experiment to see if academias 
resources can make a difference 
its like christmas morning and were ready to go said ted 
sharp an assistant dean at bus school of education as students 
returned to class wednesday 
were off to a positive start as far as the university was 
concerned despite the fanfare there was little evidence of the 
universitys new role signs welcomed students and university 
officials in vietnamese cambodian and spanish reflecting the 
native tongues of a third of the student body 
there also was talk of new computer system and a special program 
for truants but the university has longerterm goals than improving 
attendance or school equipment 
university officials talk of creating a new climate in this 
working class community of 26000 there are plans to teach parents 
about nutrition child care even neonatal care with the idea of 
preparing children for school long before they can read or write 
were talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate 
the underclass in the united states said peter greer dean of 
education who oversees the management team 
but there are many who still have doubts about the universitys 
involvement in the local schools the teachers union and hispanic 
parents have filed separate suits challenging the agreement others 
are worried the city may be left in deeper debt if the university 
doesnt raise the 2 million to 3 million it promised for special 
programs this year 
im concerned we may get stuck if the money doesnt come in 
said elizabeth mcbride chairwoman of the chelsea school committee 
we just keep getting deeper and deeper 
the unique agreement between the university and chelsea follows 
years of hard times for 3500student system an influx of 
immigrants from latin america and southeast asia swelled the school 
population declining tax revenues cut school budgets 
chelsea spends 1600 less per student than the national average 
test scores graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the 
states lowest 
seeking help school committee members approached john silber 
president of boston university who has long sought to use his 
schools resources in public education after months of negotiations 
among the school committee aldermen and the legislature an 
agreement was reached in june giving the university control 
while planners have talked about new courses and individualized 
teaching plans an emphasis has been placed on preparing children 
and their parents for school this spring the university 
experimented with a literacy program for mothers and their young 
children 
there are other plans for parental courses in nutrition and 
classes for expectant mothers all aimed at improving the health of 
future students 
you cant just prepare the teachers and the building if you 
want a successful school system said greer you have to prepare 
the students and their families 
but the ambitious plans require money university officials 
talked of raising 50 million through the life of its contract with 
chelsea while more money is expected only 726000 in pledges are 
in hand 
and there are other concerns chelseas teachers are mindful of 
silbers stormy relations with his universitys unions hispanics 
fearful the new management might end bilingual education went to 
court to try to stop the takeover 
the university has tried to soothe those fears appointing a 
management team with several bilingual experts including diana lam 
a peruvianborn boston school administrator picked to be chelseas 
new school superintendent 
the union has signed an interim contract with bu that gives 
teachers an average bonus of 1300 
there was some apprehension on the part of the teachers said 
edwin weinstein head of the chelsea teachers union now theyve 
adopted a waitandsee attitude 
ms lam realizes it will take more than goodwill programs to end 
complaints and concerns within the community 
we are not going to smooth over or dismiss these problems we 
have to deal with the emotions and find a common ground she said 
but what we do is what should count that is how we should be 
judged

a twa jetliner nearly collided with a military 
plane near chicago because the commerical planes pilot obeyed an 
air traffic controllers instruction intended for another airliner 
a federal agency said 
twa flight 818 a boeing 767 carrying 151 passengers was flying 
nonstop from st louis to paris on tuesday when it was forced to 
dive to avoid the collision at 37000 feet five people including a 
flight attendant were treated for minor injuries after the jetliner 
returned to st louis 
the national transportation safety board which investigated the 
incident said wednesday that the twa jetliner dived to miss a kc10 
tanker that was part of the 452nd air refueling wing out of march 
air force base in california 
radio transmissions will be reviewed tract data reconstructed 
and crew members and air traffic controllers interviewed the ntsb 
said 
federal aviation administration spokesman mort edelstein said 
shortly after tuesdays incident that the agency had had no 
knowledge of air traffic controllers being involved 
but keith potts the faas associate administrator of aviation 
safety said later the pilots mistakenly followed the controllers 
instructions that were intended for another aircraft 
the faa said it was unclear whether the twa pilot or the 
controller based at aurora ill was at fault the twa plane and 
the kc10 tanker were within five miles of each other when the 
evasive action was taken about 30 miles southeast of chicago the 
faa said

vice president dan quayle called the reagan 
administrations star wars missile defense strategy unrealistic 
and unveiled a less expensive revised version called brilliant 
pebbles 
instead of the system that reagan said would end the danger of 
nuclear war by making atomic weapons impotent the bush 
administration is supporting brilliant pebbles quayle said in an 
interview published in todays los angeles times 
we have redefined star wars and put it into missions 
requirements doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in 
the early 1980s quayle said 
under brilliant pebbles clusters of minimissiles would track 
incoming rockets the system is intended only to cope with a limited 
soviet attack or with the sort of missile strike that could be 
mounted by a third world country or some other nation that might 
acquire a small arsenal of relatively unsophisticated rockets 
quayle declined to estimate the cost but said it would be 
cheaper than the previous administrations concept 
he conceded that former president reagans plan known formally 
as the strategic defense initiative was never authentic 
reagan talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to 
be completely leakproof quayle said 
i believe that in the semantics of lets say political jargon 
that that was acceptable he said but it clearly was stretching 
the capability of a strategic defense system 
as a partial defense system star wars might be effective but 
supporters admit it would be nearly useless defending a city because 
a single warhead that got through could cause tremendous damage and 
loss of life 
quayle said that in addition to blocking a limited soviet attack 
the defense envisioned by the bush administration may protect the 
country from accidental missile launches or from attacks by other 
nations that recently have acquired missile technology 
he said that brilliant pebbles may be better received by the 
soviets and help ussoviet negotiations to reduce strategic 
offensive weapons moscow has insisted on stringent limits on the 
us missile defense program as part of any strategic arms agreement 
quayle who still considers the soviet union a dangerous 
adversary cautioned that the united states must not be duped by 
apparent sweeping changes in the communist bloc 
i think we have to get away from the wild euphoria that somehow 
this transition and change is going to come in the real near term 
he said we are very heartened by whats happened in poland 
poland has made tremendous progress were heartened by what is 
beginning to happen in hungary but were also realists 
let us remind ourselves that were still dealing with a 
totalitarian government and there are going to be bumps along the 
transition

by checking cancerous tissue for one protein 
doctors believe they can help predict which women with early breast 
cancer are at high risk of spreading cancer according to a report 
published today 
doctors who experimented with this approach found that by testing 
for the protein called haptoglobinrelated protein they could 
identify women who had an extremely high risk of recurrence 
they said that the presence of the protein appears to be a 
powerful primary discriminator between clinically aggressive and 
clinically indolent breast cancers its prediction power is 
dramatically improved when it is combined with information about 
the sensitivity of the tumors to the hormone progesterone 
the research was conducted by dr francis p kuhajda and 
colleagues at johns hopkins university school of medicine and 
published in the new england journal of medicine 
the study was based on 70 patients with early breast cancer who 
were treated by mastectomy from 1977 through 1985 doctors checked 
samples of their tumor tissue for the protein as well as sensitivity 
to progesterone 
overall the cancer returned in 31 women the study found that it 
recurred in 91 percent of those whose tumors produced the protein 
but were not sensitive to progesterone by contrast it recurred in 
24 percent who showed no signs of the hormone but were sensitive to 
progesterone 
doctors hope that such information will help them identify women 
who might benefit from aggressive early therapy such as 
chemotherapy and mastectomy rather than lump removal

new therapy to block malaria infection from 
harming the brain may result from a study that implicates a protein 
in that problem and other serious complications of the disease 
researchers say 
scientists reported today that red blood cells infected with a 
malariacausing parasite stick to the protein which is found in the 
inner lining of blood vessels 
attachment of infected red cells to vessel walls is thought to 
play an important part in producing complications of malaria said 
researcher anthony berendt 
for example it makes red cells clog some blood vessels of the 
brain the clogging is a key factor in cerebral malaria a 
complication reponsible for more than half the worlds deaths from 
malaria said scientist luis fajardo of stanford university medical 
school 
berendt said that if further work demonstrates that the protein 
plays a key role in cerebral malaria finding drugs aimed at 
dislodging the red cells from the protein may prove useful 
berendt of john radcliffe hospital in oxford england and 
colleagues there describe their work in the british journal nature 
the protein is called intercellular adhesion molecule1 or 
icam1 two other proteins called cd36 and thrombospondin had 
previously been implicated as possible attachment sites for infected 
red cells 
but studies suggested those proteins could not account for all 
cases of red cell attachment berendt said in a telephone interview 
that led to the work that implicates icam1 and there may be still 
more blood vessel proteins involved berendt said 
fajardo a pathology professor at stanford said the findings 
were very important 
fewer than 1 percent of the worlds estimated 100 million to 200 
million annual malaria cases are thought to progress to cerebral 
malaria but it probably kills more than 500000 people a year in 
africa alone he said 
the condition can be treated with quinine but new drugs would be 
welcome because quinine does not always work and because it has 
undesirable side effects fajardo said 
malaria occurs after a parasite is injected into the bloodstream 
from the bite of a mosquito the nature paper shows that red blood 
cells infected by the most dangerous species of malaria parasite 
plasmodium falciparum can stick to the protein icam1 
that protein is widely distributed in the inner linings of 
capillaries the tiny blood vessels where red cells can attach 
themselves in malaria researchers said 
in the test tube red cells infected by a parasite strain from 
brazil stuck to the icam1 protein on the surface of tissue cells 
red cells infected by a strain from gambia did not 
the rate of binding increased after the tissue cells were exposed 
to tumor necrosis factor a natural substance known to stimulate 
production of icam1 
fajardo said that fits in with research that found higher levels 
of tumor necrosis factor in malaria patients who suffered cerebral 
malaria than patients who did not 
the british researchers are now preparing to test a range of 
parasite strains to see how widespread the affinity for icam1 is 
berendt said 
in the nature paper they suggested that the severity of a case 
of malaria may depend on red cell affinity for various blood vessel 
proteins as determined by the infecting parasite and the infected 
persons levels of those proteins

the discovery of sharp changes in womens blood 
cholesterol levels during menopause may help explain why their heart 
attack risk soars when they reach their 50s according to a report 
published today 
in the research doctors measured changes in two main components 
of cholesterol high density lipoprotein or hdl and low density 
lipoprotein or ldl as women reached the change of life hdl 
protects against heart disease while ldl increases the risk 
the researchers found that womens hdl levels dropped four 
milligrams per deciliter of blood when they went through menopause 
while their ldl rose 12 milligrams 
dr karen a matthews said the study supports the idea that the 
menopause does lead to increased risk of coronary artery disease in 
women because of the negative changes in lipids 
while heart disease is rare in women before menopause their risk 
increases 10fold after age 55 
matthews a researcher at the university of pittsburgh directed 
the study which was published in the new england journal of 
medicine 
the study found that when menopausal women took estrogen 
supplements there was little change in their blood cholesterol 
levels 
matthews said more study will be necessary before researchers 
recommend routine use of estrogen to protect against heart disease 
estrogen supplements after menopause have been linked with an 
increase risk of some forms of cancer 
she said that women should become more aware of their cholesterol 
as they reach menopause 
as women enter the period when they likely to undergo 
menopause which is around 50 its an ideal time for them to have 
their cholesterol levels regularly checked she said if they 
begin to experience declines in hdl or increases in ldl it would be 
very useful to alter dietary factors and exercise to have a more 
healthpromoting lifestyle 
the study began with 541 women between ages 42 and 50 who had not 
undergone menopause over the next 2 years 101 of them stopped 
menstruating and 32 of these women began taking estrogen 
supplements 
their hdl and ldl levels were compared to those of women the same 
age who had not reached menopause

an exiles life is not what wuer kaixi 
wanted but he took a leading role in chinas student uprising last 
spring and when the dust had settled was on his governments 
mostwanted list 
wuer a student at beijing normal university made a dangerous 
10day journey to escape his homeland now hes starting over as a 
student at harvard university but he told the associated press on 
wednesday his eye is still on the battle back home 
if you experience that kind of massacre it changes your life 
said wuer whenever i think of my friends who were murdered in 
tiananmen square i feel the obligation 
the china information center here is now his focus its through 
this hubs telephones fax machines and computers that he works to 
effect change back home 
in june the events in beijing riveted the world and millions saw 
wuers drawn face as he stood up to premier li peng and demanded a 
dialogue 
then came the quiet morning after troops stormed the square 
killing hundreds maybe thousands only a few who fled could carry 
on in the wake of such force 
he and his girlfriend navigated chinas backroads for 10 days 
before they finally reached the south china sea and what seemed the 
only route to go 
the first step i took was into the sea and i knew that i 
wouldnt go back he said i didnt feel anything because it was 
just after the massacre and my feelings were already frozen 
those few bloody days last spring also numbed the chinese 
people but they did not cower wuer said 
this is a famous face now the tall muscular man said 
but in the city and in the country the people protected me 
even people who i didnt know kept quiet and immediately showed 
support said wuer who tried to find a way out of the country 
from eight cities before succeeding 
the people didnt like the government before but dislike has 
been displaced by hatred since their sons and daughters were gunned 
down in june wuer said 
he and many other exiled students their supporters and those who 
remain at work underground in china are getting the word out and 
forming unions 
we arent organized officially of course because the 
government doesnt want it said wuer who refused to provide 
many details on the escape but we can establish a voice outside 
china 
he said that on a recent trip to paris he helped form a group 
called the front for democratic china as a central organization to 
coordinate efforts outside of china he said a congress would be 
held later this month in paris to set an agenda and elect a 
governing board 
chinas largest newspaper recently featured wuer complete with 
various statements about his character all derisive but the 
insults dont vex him 
theyre paying a lot of attention to what were doing outside 
and that means theyre scared said wuer 
wuer says chance played a large part in his own place in the 
spotlight 
when i was a freshman in beijing i loved beer and parties 
like american kids he said but the political and economic 
situation forced me to think about the countrys system 
i stood in the front because i care about my selfworth 
wuer who will study english in his first semester at harvard said 
through a translator i stood in front because the government 
doesnt allow the chinese people to realize their own 
selfworth

its being called love canal ii and 
lately a trailer park where toxic contamination was discovered has 
begun to resemble the infamous toxic waste site just three miles 
away 
a house at the entrance to the forest glen trailer park one of 
two nontrailers in the subdivision of 53 families was the first to 
be boarded up monday the houses owner dennis bauer has relocated 
to lewiston about 10 miles north of niagara falls 
the bauer family was one of 23 households in forest glen where 
traces of benzothiazole a carcinogenic industrial chemical were 
found the federal environmental protection agency said the amounts 
in the homes were so small that they are not a health concern 
nonetheless the bauers left a sofa on their front lawn with the 
words danger contaminated spraypainted on it 
such displays were common 11 years ago when dioxin and other 
contaminants were discovered at the love canal neighborhood 
eventually 1030 families were evacuated from a 10block area 
around the former chemical dump site 
forest glen home to some of the people who left love canal also 
was built on a toxic dump 
epa spokesman michael basile said the bauers property will be 
padlocked and that a private security force has been hired to patrol 
the area 
despite the epas recommendation to leave the neighborhood some 
residents said they did not want to move away temporarily because 
they were afraid their homes would be looted 
many homes in love canal were vandalized after the evacuations 
the dilapidated homes still stand as a monument to environmental 
disaster although some have been torn down as part of a plan to 
revitalize the area 
federal officials have made no determination on the longterm 
future of forest glen until residents are out there can be no 
excavations to determine the extent of the contamination officials 
said 
as of monday the federal emergency management agency had taken 
24 applications for temporary relocation said spokesman bert 
gallowing 
of those six have moved offsite eight have found new 
residences and are waiting to move and 10 others are still looking 
twentythree other families are considering moving their trailers 
out of the park six families have not announced plans and are 
believed to be waiting for the federal buyout which is expected to 
take up to a year 
basile said once families moved the epa will board up their 
homes to protect them from vandalism

greek objections to nato proposals on 
limiting military maneuvers in europe prevented their introduction 
as east and west resumed their search today for ways to reduce the 
armies and weapons massed across europe 
diplomats who asked not to be identified said the nato proposals 
required further consultation after greece began voicing objections 
to them early in the week 
nato diplomats in vienna and brussels worked hard wednesday to 
put the finishing touches to the proposal billed by senior 
officials as an unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on 
the worlds most heavily armed continent 
but greece objected to provisions mandating that maneuvers 
requiring the callup of 40000 or more reservists and the use of 
1200 or more armored personnel carriers be announced in advance 
diplomatic sources said 
athens which is traditionally wary of nato ally and neighbor 
turkey was seeking lower limits they said adding they viewed this 
as a psychological problem that could be overcome 
nato and the warsaw pact also hope during this sixweek round to 
present what both sides bill as sweeping proposals on verification 
but diplomats from both military blocs speaking on condition of 
anonymity have suggested they are finding it difficult to reconcile 
interests within their two alliances 
us ambassador stephen j ledogar said in an interview wednesday 
that some tough problems have so far blocked a nato compromise 
on verification proposals 
he mentioned specifically differences between the united states 
and canada which are pushing for maximum verification and european 
nations that are concerned this would mean almost constant visits by 
military inspectors from the soviet bloc 
but both ledogar and a diplomat from another nato nation 
expressed confidence the verification proposals would be ready 
during the current round of talks 
soviet ambassador oleg a grinevsky in an interview with west 
germanys zdf television station announced warsaw pact intentions 
of introducing sweeping verification proposals he billed as bolder 
than anything nato could produce 
reiterating offers western diplomats said had been made during 
earlier closeddoor negotiations grinevsky said the soviet union 
would even be prepared to countenance the permanent stationing of 
nato officers on its territory to check its compliance with eventual 
accords to cut europes nonnuclear weapons he revealed no other 
details 
the 23nation vienna talks opened in march and despite 
continuing differences over definitiions of weapons and which 
categories to cut first have moved along briskly 
most diplomats at the talks have dismissed president bushs goal 
of agreement by years end as too optimistic but ledogar said he 
thought it realistic to aim for some agreements by next year 
grinevsky also told west german television that 1990 was a 
realistic target for preliminary agreement after what he called the 
unique breakthrough achieved in the first two rounds of talks 
president bush has proposed limiting the united states and the 
soviet union to no more than 275000 troops outside their borders in 
europe 
the west wants no more than 20000 tanks 16500 artillery pieces 
and 28000 armored troop carriers for each alliance 
on the sensitive issue of aircraft identifed by both east and 
west as the biggest stumbling block of the talks nato proposes that 
east and west each be limited to no more than 5700 combat aircraft 
and 1900 combat helicopters 
no one country could have more than 3420 combat aircraft and 
1140 combat helicopters 
the warsaw pact in march proposed to reduce six kinds of weapons 
including aircraft by 10 to 15 percent by 1994 cutting by a 
further 25 percent by 1997 and moving to purely defensive forces by 
the year 2000 
the soviet union which under mikhail s gorbachev is clearly 
anxious to save on military spending to meet pressing consumer 
demands at home has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from 
eastern europe 
some 50000 red army soldiers and 5000 tanks are to leave 
hungary east germany and czechoslovakia by the end of 1990

rebels in northern ethiopia say they have 
taken four more towns including a strategic government garrison in 
an offensive that began last week 
the clandestine radio of the tigray peoples liberation front 
said wednesday the rebels had captured the garrison town of weldiya 
in wollo province killing 103 government soldiers and capturing 26 
the broadcast was monitored in nairobi on the eve of scheduled 
peace talks in atlanta in the united states between the government 
and another major rebel group the eritrean peoples liberation 
front 
the tigrean rebels also said they had overrun three smaller towns 
in wollo province in three days of heavy fighting that began aug 
31 the radio identified them as robit gobiye and dorogebir 
the tigrean front newly allied with the ethiopian peoples 
democratic movement had earlier claimed the capture of a string of 
towns along a major highway leading south toward addis ababa the 
capital 
weldiya about 200 miles north of the capital is an important 
junction on the northsouth highway connecting it with a route 
running west to gondar province 
the eritrean rebels have been fighting since 1962 for the 
independence of ethiopias northernmost province 
the tigreans seek greater autonomy for their region which is 
immediately to the south of eritrea 
the ethiopian peoples democratic movement is a much smaller 
group that has been active in wollo and gondar provinces

georgias 156yearold sodomy law cannot be 
applied to consenting married couples a judge ruled in clearing a 
man who spent 18 months in prison for having oral sex with his wife 
a lawyer for the american civil liberties union lauded the ruling 
wednesday as a step toward getting rid of this monstrous statute 
superior court judge robert castellani said james d moseley a 
35yearold carpenter had been imprisoned illegally he was serving 
a twoyear term 
government has no business with a married couples private 
consentual sexual practices castellani wrote moseleys right 
to marital and domestic privacy has been violated by the sodomy law 
as applied to him 
whew i feel like someone took a millstone from around my 
neck said moseley apparently the first person convicted under 
the law for conduct between marriage partners the judge had freed 
him last week pending a decision 
attorney general michael bowers said the state may appeal after 
an examination of whether the ruling might reach beyond married 
couples 
bowers said he agreed that the sodomy law cannot be applied to 
consenting married couples but the prosecutor had argued that the 
evidence suggested moseleys wife did not consent to the sodomy 
i think at least all married couples can celebrate said 
clive staffordsmith an aclu lawyer who represented moseley they 
can bring out the champagne but there are still a large number of 
nervous people in georgia who are not married 
moseleys commonlaw wife bette roberts had accused him of 
forcing himself on her and she filed a complaint in 1988 that led to 
moseley being charged with rape and aggravated or forcible oral 
and anal sodomy 
moseley denied using force and was acquitted on those counts but 
was found guilty of the lesser charge of oral sodomy after admitting 
the couple had oral sex georgia law makes oral sex a crime even 
between consenting adults 
the judge said that the jurys acquittal of moseley on the rape 
and aggravated sodomy charges meant it believed no force had been 
involved 
castellani cited a recent us supreme court ruling that upheld 
application of the sodomy law against homosexuals the majority 
decision in that case acknowledged the law might not hold up if 
applied to married couples

the government reported today that american 
businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by 77 
percent in 1989 a sign that many company managers do not believe a 
recession is imminent 
businesses responding to a commerce department survey completed 
in august said they expected to spend 46395 billion for expansion 
and modernization this year up from a record 43074 billion spent 
on business investment in 1988 the 1988 figure was revised from 
42369 billion reported earlier the numbers are adjusted for 
inflation 
some economists had feared that business leaders would be 
inclined to cut back on capital spending if they felt a severe 
economic slowdown was on the horizen 
there was concern earlier this year that the economy now 
approaching its seventh year of growth might be headed for a 
recession as the federal reserve tightened credit in an attempt to 
contain inflation 
however interest rates began creeping down last spring and a 
number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is 
slowing though not as fast as previously thought 
the new estimate for capital spending this year shows businesses 
were increasing their plans for plant and equipment spending as the 
year wore on an earlier survey released in june found businesses 
planning to increase spending by 65 percent a march survey 
indicated a 63 percent increase 
in an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans 
conducted last december companies had estimated their capital 
spending could rise 59 percent this year 
economists generally interpret plant and equipment spending as a 
plus for the economy because it indicates continued expansion and 
eases inflationary pressures by increasing productive capacity 
capital spending grew a revised 89 percent in 1988 the 
department said as companies rushed to expand production to meet 
rising export demand 
spending climbed a revised 42 percent in 1987 and dropped 39 
percent in 1986 
in the latest survey manufacturing companies said they planned a 
61 percent increase in capital outlays to 17824 billion compared 
to a revised 117 percent in 1988 this includes a 28 percent rise 
in plants that produce durable goods bigticket items expected to 
last three years or more and a 91 percent increase in companies 
producing nondurable goods 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 87 
percent to 28572 billion 
before adjusting for inflation 1989 plant and equipment spending 
is expected to rise 10 percent to 47365 billion down from 105 
percent in 1988

corruption was a key issue raised by students during the 
nationwide prodemocracy movement this spring 
after the crackdown of the movement china announced a major 
anticorruption campaign that would include top government officials 
and party members 
most of the cases involved officials who obtain large supplies of 
scarce raw materials at low governmentset prices and then sell them 
for large profits on the free market 
the visit by compaore was the first by a head of state since 
president mikhail s gorbachev visited in midmay when the 
studentled protests that began april 15 reached their peak 
up to 1 million people crowded tiananmen square forcing 
humiliated officials to cancel ceremonies planned for gorbachev in 
the vast plaza 
compaore was welcomed by yang one of the key figures behind the 
governments decision to send troops to crush the student 
demonstrators hundreds perhaps thousands were believed killed in 
the crackdown 
your excellency and other african leaders have fully understood 
and supported the quelling of the counterrevolutionary rebellion in 
beijing thats why we have to thank you yang told compaore 
highlevel diplomatic contacts with the west have been largely 
frozen since the crackdown with the united states and other western 
countries condemning the chinese leadership for its violent 
suppression of the student movement

member of a colombian drug cartel authorities said 
the anonymous call was made at 2 am saturday to the fbi in new

a court today began hearing an 810 
million lawsuit against ferdinand marcos based on the former 
presidents tax returns 
it is the first case against marcos that has gone to trial in the 
philippines since he was ousted three years ago 
in all the government has filed 35 civil suits since in 1987 to 
recover 100 billion that marcos and 300 associates are accused of 
stealing during his 24 years in power he was forced into exile in 
hawaii after a popularmilitary uprising ousted him in february 1986 
solicitor general frank chavez said he expects to call as many as 
20 witnesses and hopes the trial will persuade courts in switzerland 
and elsewhere to speed up proceedings to recover money marcos 
allegedly invested abroad 
this is the first real significant step toward the recovery of 
illgotten wealth chavez said 
in the case being heard in the nations antigraft court the 
government is seeking 476 million in damages and recovery of up to 
334 million in property marcos and his wife imelda allegedly 
purchased in new york 
government lawyers said they will argue that marcos and his wife 
owned properties worth far more than they could afford based on 
assets declared in income tax returns 
assistant solicitor general romeo de la cruz told the threejudge 
panel that marcos presidential annual salary totaled 71000 for 
his nearly quartercentury in power mrs marcos earned 34000 
during nine years as minister of human settlements and governor of 
the metro manila commission de la cruz said 
eliseo pitargue intelligence chief of the bureau of internal 
revenue testified that between 1960 and 1984 the couple declared 
total assets equivalent to 657000 at current exchange rates 
they paid nearly 271000 in income taxes in that time pitargue 
said 
chavez said marcos tax records will establish the patently 
gross and scandalously disproportionate acquisition of mr marcos on 
the basis of his declared wealth 
marcos lawyers rafael recto and juan david were in the 
courtroom but told reporters they are not representing the couple 
recto said he will report to marcos on the proceedings 
this is all a big charade recto told reporters before the 
proceedings adjourned until friday this case will take about 100 
years more 
marcos had insisted on his right to defend himself but the court 
ruled he forfeited it by ignoring subpoenas delivered to his 
honolulu home 
president corazon aquino marcos successor has refused to allow 
him to return citing national security marcos is reported in 
critical condition at a honolulu hospital where he has been 
confined since january with heart kidney and lung failure 
marcos and his wife were indicted by a us federal grand jury 
last year on racketeering charges for allegedly pillaging the 
philippine treasury and investing some of the money in the united 
states 
mrs marcos denied the charges and is free on 5 million bail 
marcos was temporarily separated from the case because of failing 
health 
the marcoses have never been charged with a criminal offense in a 
philippine court because the government fears they would invoke 
their constitutional right to return to face their accusers

the city transit agency has agreed to pay at least 
689000 to the estate and children of a black man who was struck 
and killed by a subway train after being chased into a station by a 
gang of whites in 1982 
the settlement was reached in july and made public wednesday by 
the massachusetts bay transportation authority in response to a 
freedom of information act request by the boston globe 
william f atkinson jr a 30yearold janitor died after 
fleeing a group of white men who chased him in the citys dorchester 
section in 1985 two men were convicted of manslaughter and three 
of assault in the attack 
the settlement stemmed from a 10 million negligence and 
wrongfuldeath suit filed by the mothers of atkinsons children 
ages 10 and 19 
the suit alleged that mbta workers neglected to notify police 
immediately when atkinson and a friend fled into the station and 
failed to alert train operators that atkinson had run onto the 
tracks 
the suit also claimed that the train that hit atkinson was 
operating without headlights 
the mbta also agreed to pay 138000 to atkinsons estate of 
which some will go to his children the agency will also pay the 
children at least 551000 in installments for the rest of their 
lives the globe said today 
the children are atkinsons sole heirs because their mothers 
never married him 
atkinson was walking along a street around 1230 am with a 
white friend william grady when a group of whites began shouting 
racial epithets hurling bottles and threatening to kill the pair 
authorities said 
the suit claimed that william davulis a coin changer failed to 
call police when atkinson ran into the station and called for help 
it was not until davulis saw grady punched that he finally called 
for help the suit alleged 
davulis called police a second time after he was initially placed 
on hold but left for home before police arrived the suit said mbta 
police arrived seven minutes later looked around saw no one and 
left the globe reported

senate majority leader george j mitchell today 
assailed a proposed capitalgains tax cut as a break for the rich 
that would be paid for by middleincome americans 
in addition he said the cut proposed by president bush and 
others would undoubtedly cause a loss of government revenue over 
any period of time beyond one year and thus would worsen the 
budget deficit 
the present proposal is unfair unwise the maine democrat 
told reporters it is effectively a tax break for the wealthy to 
be paid for by the middle class it is a 31000ayear tax break 
for those whose income exceeds 200000 a year 
a capitalgains reduction also would unravel the big 1986 tax 
overhaul mitchell added when the tax system was rewritten by 
congress capital gains was only one of several special tax breaks 
that were wiped out in order to allow a significant reduction of tax 
rates 
under the new law capital gains profits from the sale of stock 
and other assets are taxed at the same rate as wages and other 
income bush has proposed to reduce the rate to 15 percent 
mitchell reasons that if a preference is restored for capital 
gains pressure will increase to bring back other benefits that were 
ended in 1986 
in that regard sens alfonse damato rny and christopher 
dodd dconn announced today they were introducing a bill to 
restore taxdeductible individual retirement accounts for all 
workers regardless of income the 1986 law restricted deductible 
iras only to lowerpaid workers and those not covered by a company 
pension 
in running for the presidency last year bush promised to seek a 
reduction in the capitalgains tax in order to spur investment and 
saving 
a majority of the house ways and means committee favors a 
temporary cut in the capitalgains tax which could help reduce the 
budget deficit in the short term by prompting investors to sell some 
assets they have been holding for some time 
however many economists dispute the administrations contention 
that a capitalgains cut would produce longterm revenue gains 
the ways and means committee is weighing an alternative by 
chairman dan rostenkowski dill that would protect against 
taxation of gains caused solely by inflation and also provide more 
favorable tax treatment of longterm gains 
but mitchell said now is not the time to even consider a 
capitalgains cut chiefly because of the budget deficit 
he noted that in 1986 when tax overhaul was being debated he 
offered an amendment that would have retained a special tax break 
for capital gains but only as part of a plan that would include a 
higher tax rate on income of all kinds earned by wealthier taxpayers 
that amendment was defeated when 49 of the 53 republican senators 
voted against it now mitchell said republicans have made a 
complete reversal and want a lower rate for capital gains 
the internal revenue service estimates that 70 percent of the 
benefit of a capitalgains cut would go to those with incomes over 
100000 a year

the communist party will turn over 
millions of dollars to the government and open its books for 
inspection as it prepares to share power the state newspaper said 
today 
imre pozsgay a reformist member of the fourman communist 
leadership made the pledge wednesday to opposition groups 
discussing the political shape of hungary as the country gears up 
for free elections next year the paper said 
the talks focusing on preparations for the first free elections 
since the 1948 communist takeover frequently have been bogged down 
but the newspaper magyar hirlap reported some progress after 
the wednesday session agreed to increase the number of seats in 
parliament from 350 to 374 other issues remained in dispute it 
said 
mti the state news agency said pozsgay was defeated in an 
election wednesday of delegates to the oct 6 communist party 
congress where reformists are expected to battle orthodox marxists 
over the communist partys future 
he will have a vote at the session anyway because he is a member 
of the 113member communist party central committee but his defeat 
was seen as a victory for those in the party who oppose the rapid 
pace of reforms 
leading communist reformist zoltan szabo told reporters the 
communist partys oligarchy is becoming active now that they have 
realized that they may be in danger of losing control of the party 
the communist leadership decided in february to permit multiparty 
elections by june 1990 the decision was part of the political 
social and economic reforms that have kept hungary in the forefront 
of change within the soviet bloc creating concern among leaders of 
more hardline warsaw pact countries 
at the talks opposition leaders continue to urge that only 
registered parties be allowed to nominate candidates magyar hirlap 
said the communist party which still exercises some control over 
broadbased organizations such as the patriotic peoples front 
wants them to propose candidates as well 
opposition spokesmen have made the finances and property of 
hungarys communist party an issue claiming the party seized many 
things illegally when it took power pozsgays announcement appears 
calculated to defuse controversy 
the paper quoted him as saying the party will hand over 35 
million to the increasingly independentminded government to finance 
the emerging multiparty system and that party books will be opened 
after the elections

the overwhelming majority of latino immigrants 
say they intend to stay in the united states but many say theyve 
delayed applying for citizenship because the exam is too difficult 
a survey released today said 
these findings suggest that one effective method to increase 
us citizenship among latino immigrants would be education and 
outreach activities to demystify the naturalization process the 
national association of latino elected and appointed officials said 
in a release announcing results of the telephone survey of 1635 
immigrants in eight states the association said such activities 
should also be designed to allay fears about the difficulty of the 
citizenship examination 
the average european and asian immigrant waits seven to eight 
years before naturalizing but hispanic immigrants wait an average 
of 14 to 15 years the association said 
however once latino immigrants take the exam the survey said 
most pass and dont find it difficult 
rep edward roybal dcalif president of the associations 
educational fund told a news conference the survey results are 
especially important because this is a group that many believe 
will not be fully counted in the next census 
the latino group said its survey also showed that hispanic 
immigrants are more politically active than previously believed 
in light of the surveys findings many of our societys 
assumptions about latino immigrants will need to be reexamined 
the group said foremost among these assumptions is the perception 
that latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning to 
return to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or upon 
retirement 
ninetyeight percent of those interviewed said they wanted to 
make the united states their permanent home and 79 percent said 
life in the united states is better than in their native country 
ninetyfive percent said that an important reason for wanting to 
become a us citizen is that it allows you to vote 
sixtythree percent of the cubans interviewed identified 
themselves as republicans while 42 percent of mexicans and 34 
percent of other latin americans said they were democrats 
the study said 81 percent of the naturalized latinos surveyed 
were registered to vote compared with 70 percent of the general 
us voting age population 
paradoxically however 46 percent said they saw no real benefits 
of becoming a us citizen 
difficulty of the immigration and naturalization service 
examination was cited as an important reason by 39 percent and 
discrimination against latinos by 35 percent 
fortyfour percent of those interviewed were naturalized citizens 
and the remaining 66 percent were permanent legal residents 
despite their overwhelming desire to remain in the united states 
17 percent of the nonnaturalized latinos said an important reason 
for not becoming a citizen was that they planned to return to their 
homeland some day 
rosalind gold a research associate with the latino group said 
the respondents may have thought about whether it was an important 
reason for a person not becoming a citizen rather than really 
answering in the personal sense about what their personal plans 
were 
the survey was conducted in california texas florida new york 
new jersey illinois arizona and maryland nearly half of those 
interviewed were from mexico and onefourth from cuba the principal 
other countries of origin included the dominican republic colombia 
el salvador and ecuador 
the survey was conducted by the educational fund of the 
association which claims a membership of more than 3300 hispanic 
elected officials appointed officials and community and business 
leaders it did not give a margin of error

a fan who pursued justine bateman for 
months was put under psychiatric observation for holding police at 
bay outside a theater and threatening to kill himself if the actress 
didnt talk to him authorities said 
bateman who played shoppingcrazy mallory keaton in the tv 
series family ties was not inside at the time but went on stage 
hours later for the opening of the play lulu in which she has 
the title role of a femme fatale 
authorities said john thomas smetek 39 of houston imagined he 
was romantically involved with with the 23yearold bateman he was 
taken to highland hospital after his arrest wednesday at the 
berkeley repertory theater 
smetek was booked for investigation of weapons offenses bail was 
set at 25000 
she just hopes that he seeks the help he needs said 
batemans publicist cindy guagenti 
smetek kept police at bay for three hours holding a loaded gun 
to his abdomen and forcing cancellation of a midday rehearsal he 
just wants to talk with her and indicate his lovefixation with 
her said lt robert peters 
earlier this year police said smetek claimed to be a producer 
and tried to speak to bateman at the family ties sound stage in 
hollywood 
he first appeared outside the berkeley theater friday and 
bateman more or less brushed him off peters said when she saw 
him the next day she notified police who questioned smetek but 
he really hadnt committed any crimes 
richard griffoul a spokesman for the theater said the theater 
had hired security guards and circulated smeteks description among 
employees 
justine was aware that he was pursuing her and took the 
situation seriously said guagenti 
its no joke said griffoul this type of thing is the 
worst scenario for a person in the public eye 
the incident was the latest in a series of security threats to 
celebrities 
on july 18 actress rebecca schaeffer who appeared in the tv 
series my sister sam was shot to death at the door to her los 
angeles apartment a 19yearold described as an obsessed fan has

the united states is planning to use what may 
be the ultimate weapon against fidel castros cuba television 
by the end of the year a million or more sovietmade tv sets are 
expected to tune in six hours a day seven days a week to 
americanmade news programs and the best reruns hollywood has to 
offer courtesy of the us information agency 
could programs such as dynasty days of our lives and pro 
bowling lure big cuban audiences away from staterun tv 
proponents say cubans will flock to their sets as they 
apparently did with radio marti and take their first uncensored 
look at the outside world in 30 years 
but critics say tv marti may harden antiamerican attitudes in 
cuba violate international communications laws and cause massive 
headaches for florida broadcasters who may find themselves blacked 
out by tv martis powerful signal or who may be bludgeoned by 
retaliatory broadcasts from havana 
president bush supports sending tv to cuba as do many members of 
congress and cuban exile groups 
but the plan has faced some powerful opponents including sen 
claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign relations 
committee and the national association of broadcasters 
after three years of rancorous debate over the wisdom of such an 
enterprise the house and senate this year voted money to begin tv 
marti testing this fall 
but the senate before it appropriated 75 million in july for a 
90day tv marti test agreed to hold up funds for full operation 
until the senate foreign relations committee holds hearings on 
whether tv marti would violate us treaty obligations 
the house earlier authorized 32 million for tv marti over the 
next two years and the house and senate measures are awaiting 
resolution in conference committee 
if the spending plan gains final congressional approval the usia 
will begin satellite relays of spanishlanguage programs from 
washington to a receiving station in cudjoe key fla there weather 
permitting the signals will be fed to a transmitter aboard a giant 
balloon tethered two miles above the atlantic and thence to cuba 
some 90 miles away 
cubans tv marti backers say are eagerly awaiting us 
television 
my understanding is they cant wait for it to start 
jacqueline tillman executive director of the cubanamerican 
national foundation in washington said wednesday 
radio marti has and hopefully tv marti will as well provide 
views to the cuban people that they are not receiving 
tillman said radio marti has helped nurture human rights groups 
made the cuban populace aware of the number of cuban army casualties 
in angola the level of oppression in cuba aids and the new era of 
openness in the soviet union and east bloc 
all that news is frequently censored by the cuban government 
media so the promise of tv marti with pictures is very 
important she said 
cuban officials have labeled tv marti anticuban propaganda 
and said they will take appropriate measures against it when radio 
marti was launched in may 1985 cuba briefly tried to jam the 
broadcasts 
the national association of broadcasters has lobbied against tv 
marti saying it could wreak havoc on us stations which already 
are subject to periodic radio blasts from enormously powerful cuban 
transmitters 
the idea is technically flawed and there are no provisions to 
protect us broadcasters from either direct interference from tv 
martis signal or retaliatory broadcasts from cuba nab spokesman 
walt wurfel said wednesday 
cuba has demonstrated in the past it has powerful transmitters 
that can cause interference to us radio stations from florida to 
north carolina and as far west as des moines iowa wurfel said 
some cubanamerican groups also oppose tv marti 
manuel r gomez president of the cubanamerican committee fund 
wrote recently in a new york times oped piece that tv marti 
violates a 1982 treaty that stipulates that normal tv transmission 
wavelengths are for domestic national use only 
the creation of tv marti would surely be perceived by cuba as a 
hostile act gomez said the cuban community in the us will 
suffer the brunt of cubas displeasure as we did after radio marti 
when cuba virtually closed off all family visits to the island

the christian army commander gen michel 
aoun today said the us decision to remove its diplomats from 
lebanon was based on halftruths hearsay and downright black 
propaganda 
aoun lashed out at the united states during a news conference in 
his underground bunker hours after another artillery battle between 
christian and moslem forces left at least two people dead and seven 
injured 
the us staff at the beirut embassy was evacuated on wednesday 
amid souring relations with aoun and a protest at the facility 
during which hundreds of christians demanded the united states press 
syria to end the fighting 
on saturday the 54yearold maronite catholic charged that the 
united states has sold lebanon to syria out of fear for the 
lives of eight americans held hostage by proiranian shiite moslem 
groups in lebanon 
he compared his war against the syrians to the american war of 
independence and called on the american people to support the 
christians 
the ustrained general was clearly angered by us state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwilers remark that the 30 us 
diplomats were pulled out because he had threatened them with a 
good dose of christian terrorism 
she said an unidentified christian leader told diplomats they 
moved in and out of the compound in the christian sector of beirut 
at their own risk 
aoun said during the hourlong news conference that ms 
tutwilers remark was a calculated but crude personal attack on me 
its an attack perhaps born of desperation rather than 
exasperation at the continued lebanese resistance and based at best 
on halftruth hearsay and downright black propaganda at which we 
all know the state department excels 
lebanons ambassador to washington abdallah bouhabib also 
disputed the us charge that american diplomats were exposed to 
terrorism 
we think that there was no danger whatsoever for the american 
diplomats there the envoy said he appealed to americans to 
support all the lebanese moslems and christians in our war of 
liberation against syrias 40000 troops in lebanon who the 
christians refer to as an occupation force 
police said two people were killed and seven wounded in five 
hours of shelling before dawn today the fighting ended a week of 
diminished fighting in the sixmonth confrontation between aouns 
forces and the syrians 
the deaths raised the casualty toll since the fighting erupted 
march 8 to at least 830 killed and 2462 wounded nearly all of them 
civilians 
the artillery battles began late wednesday 12 hours after the 
american diplomats were airlifted by us navy helicopter to cyprus 
100 miles away

attackers fired several rockets from jordan into 
israel today but the shells exploded harmlessly the military said 
at least one rocket landed in jordan officials of the arab 
country said it was the second attack in a week and the fifth this 
year across the normally quiet border 
israeli soldiers watched the sovietmade katyusha rockets sailed 
into the sky shortly after midnight and found the remains of one 
107mm rocket in searches this morning the military command said in 
a communique 
the blasts roused israelis from sleep at a nearby kibbutz or 
collective farm the only damage was a crater in the jordan river 
valley 
jordans official news agency said one rocket landed near the 
border village of adasiyya 
in keeping with israeli army policy military sources declined to 
be more specific about where the rockets landed in the jewish state 
israels border with jordan has been a quiet frontier for years 
but several recent incidents have broken the calm 
israeli officials said a palestinian guerrilla crossed the border 
saturday and killed two israeli soldiers before he was shot to 
death jordan said it could find no evidence of a crossing 
another israeli trooper was killed in a march 18 infiltration 
along the southern border claimed by fatahuprising a syrianbased 
palestinian group outside the palestine liberation organization 
jordan said it arrested several people involved in that raid 
the israelis killed two jordanian soldiers in two other border 
crossings this year in the north and south of the country jordan 
said the two had deserted their posts 
neither jordan nor israel use katyusha rockets but some 
palestinian guerrilla factions do jordan does not permit guerrilla 
attacks across its borders into israel and it expelled palestinian 
guerrillas in a 197071 civil war sharply reducing such attempts

a senate subcommittee voted today to 
permanently forbid smoking on all domestic airline routes expanding 
the current ban covering flights lasting only two hours or less 
on a unanimous voice vote the senate appropriations 
transportation subcommittee adopted an 119 billion spending bill 
for transportation programs for fiscal 1990 that includes the 
strengthened smoking prohibition the 1990 fiscal year begins oct 1 
there was no debate on the smoking provision 
the full appropriations committee planned to vote on the bill 
later in the day subcommittee chairman frank lautenberg dnj 
who sponsored the proposal said he expected to prevail there but to 
face a tough fight from tobaccostate senators when the legislation 
reaches the senate floor next week 
we hear rumblings in the woods that the war drums are being 
beaten and we expect a fulldress battle in the future he said 
on aug 3 the house adopted legislation that would permanently 
extend the current ban on cigarette smoking on flights of two hours 
or less the existing restriction enacted two years ago will 
otherwise expire next april 
house sponsor richard durbin dill was blocked from offering 
an amendment that would have applied the prohibition to all domestic 
flights 
the ban on twohour flights covers four out of five us airline 
routes 
health groups and airline employee unions have worked for the 
extended ban arguing that cigarette smoke inhaled by nonsmokers 
can cause cancer and other diseases cigarette manufacturers insist 
that evidence of health problems is inconclusive and say that the 
ban harms tobacco farmers and others who rely on cigarette sales for 
their livelihoods 
the tobacco lobby has conceded that a permanent extension of the 
ban on twohour flights is inevitable they have even signaled that 
they prefer the permanent ban to a temporary one hoping it would 
eliminate a renewal of debate on the issue every time the 
restriction expires

president bush today praised the courage and 
determination of the government of colombia for extraditing an 
accused major drug trafficker to the united states and warned 
against letting critics of his antinarcotics strategy lose the 
war 
bush addressing the annual convention of the american legion 
appealed to the veterans to rally behind his antidrug and 
anticrime measures to help free our country from the fear of 
drugs and crime 
the president recalling a nowfamous campaign gaffe he made ast 
last years legion convention also jokingly told the veterans to 
remember pearl harbor bush shocked the convention on sept 7 
1988 by saying it was pearl harbor day the day actuall is dec 7 
bush said the extradition wednesday of eduardo martinez romero 
indicted in atlanta on charges of laundering money for the medellin 
drug cartel sends a strong signal of the courage and 
determination of president barco and the colombian government to 
deal with this scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us 
he said his 79 billion antidrug package unveiled in a speech 
to the nation tuesday night will require the bravery and 
sacrifice that americans have shown before and must again 
as veterans you know how battles are often fought house by 
house block by block well well win this battle the same way 
were going to win win it kid by kid neighborhood by 
neighborhood said the president 
democrats have charged the bush drug plan is underfunded and 
inadequate to meet the menace 
to them bush replied some incredibly say its not enough 
this from the very people who oppose the death penalty its that 
kind of thinking thats lost too many battles 
so lets not let these critics lose the war said bush i 
ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our 
drug strategy 
bush who entered the convention hall wearing his american legion 
post 77 cap from his hometown of houston also attacked the 
housepassed defense authorization bill and commended the legions 
support of his call for a constitutional amendment to protect the 
flag 
legion officials presented him with petitions signed by a million 
people in support of a constitutional amendment 
he said the housepassed 295 billion defense budget is totally 
unacceptable to the commanderinchief of the united states armed 
forces 
he charged that the house version now headed for compromising 
with a senate defense bill would strip money from programs 
crucial to modernizing strategic weapons including the mobile 
midgetman missile and putting the mx missile on rail cars 
recalling his campaign gaffe bush said today surprisingly is 
sept 7 can you believe it and im determined not to repeat the 
mistake i made exactly one year ago when i referred to this as pearl 
harbor day as long as i live ill remember the gasp from the 
audience 
from the convention the president went to nearby fort mchenry 
for a ceremony marking the 175th anniversary of the battle of 
baltimore in the war of 1812 against the british which inspired 
francis scott key to write the starspangled banner 
standing before a 90foot white flagpole bush called it one of 
americas most hallowed shrines he said baltimore stopped a 
british invasion and preserved our independence in one of the 
greatest chapters in the american experience 
the speeches in the baltimore area kicked off a series of 
outoftown appearances to drum up support for the antidrug 
strategy on friday he heads to new orleans to deliver the same 
message 
although the drug plan doesnt call for direct use of us 
troops it proposes sending some drug offenders to militarystyle 
boot camps in addition the administration is seriously considering 
using national guard forces for marijuana eradication said drug 
policy director william j bennett 
bush in a series of appearances wednesday in behalf of his 
program struck back at democrats who attacked his program 
while apologizing for getting down into the trenches of 
domestic politics he told an audience that included a group of 
latin american ambassadors i couldnt help but notice that the 
minute i finished speaking there was the predictable response by 
some that we havent done enough 
on capitol hill some democrats pushed the case for raising taxes 
to finance an allout fight against narcotics with rep dan 
rostenkowski dill declaring unless the president supports the 
tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war the drug 
dealers are going to win 
house speaker thomas foley dwash said that without the 
administrations support the idea of raising taxes is futile 
bush has rejected new taxes

swedish police hustled hundreds of 
english soccer hooligans out of the country today after they 
ransacked shops and scuffled with rowdy swedish youths 
police said 102 britons and 106 swedes were arrested before and 
after wednesdays world cup qualifying match which ended in a 00 
draw 
duty officer lennart norden said 78 people spent the night in 
jail 
newspapers ran a picture of two youths one with a raised club in 
his hand kicking a man outside a stockholm train station dozens of 
people looked on 
a few britons and swedes may be charged with assault and 
vandalism but nearly all the foreigners have been freed and given 
48 hours to leave sweden said superintendent kurt nilsson 
in london prime minister margaret thatcher called the fans 
behavior a disgrace to britain and her government asked soccer 
officials to cancel a visit by the national team to the netherlands 
in december 
i am always horrified if there is any difficulty with football 
fans abroad she said 
scandinavian seaways said today it refused passage to about 20 
britons fearing violence it bought back return tickets from one 
group and volunteered to pay for 10 people to find another way home 
we didnt want them on board said a spokesman 
the shipping line said it confiscated passports of another 30 
passengers and threatened to turn over the documents to british 
police if there was any problem at sea 
about 600 policemen at the rasunda stadium in suburban stockholm 
kept the british fans isolated in a standing terrace during the 
game dozens of visitors were escorted directly from the stadium to 
trains for the west coast ports of goteborg and helsingborg for the 
return ferry to britain 
swedes and britons clashed later in town but no serious injuries 
were reported the trouble was less than we expected said 
police superintendent sture hoglund one newspaper headline read 
police win the match 
earlier about 100 england supporters mostly teenagers 
rampaged through downtown stockholm throwing bottles at police 
vehicles knocking down passersby and vandalizing shops 
one large group of youngsters entered the ahlens department 
store overturning flower pots and goods displays some looting also 
was reported norden said 
no more wrote sports commentator stefan thylin in the 
aftonbladet daily this problem seems insoluble england must be 
shut out of the european soccer community 
the hooliganism could effect a decision by the european soccer 
clubs governing body uefa to lift a ban against english clubs 
playing in europe the ban was imposed after england supporters were 
blamed for a riot that triggered a stampede in belgium killing 39 
spectators the ban does not apply to the national team 
on monday a british fan died when he jumped off a ferry into the 
north sea under the influence of drugs he panicked when companions 
sprayed him with a fire extinguisher 
fears of hooliganism prompted the british football association to 
ask its swedish counterpart to cut back ticket sales in britain 
about 1000 visitors attended the match at rasunda which was filled 
to its 38500seat capacity

senate judiciary committee chairman joseph 
biden pledged today to put president bushs antidrug legislation 
on a fast track while another senior democrat clashed with 
william bennett over the administrations refusal to ban usmade 
assault rifles 
bennett the point man in the administrations war on drugs told 
sen edward m kennedy in a senate judiciary committee hearing there 
were constitutional problems with a rifleban proposal 
bennetts appearance was his first of two during the day as 
congress began its review of the 79 billion drug package bush 
outlined in a nationally televised speech tuesday night bush wants 
a crackdown on casual users of drugs and more money for treatment 
facilities as well as more prison cells to house criminals and 
steppedup efforts against south american drug lords 
a number of congressional democrats have said bush should 
recommend a tax increase to pay for the plan instead of proposing to 
take money from other programs the 79 billion sought is 22 
billion above the 1989 budget authorization 
biden ddel told bennett he hoped consultations could begin as 
soon as possible with congressional leaders over the drug 
legislation 
no formal bills have been introduced yet although they are 
expected to be over the next several days 
kennedy said the arsenals kept by colombian drug lords have been 
heavily stocked with americanmade guns the american people want 
action to outlaw the weapons of choice of these thugs and 
mobsters on the streets he said 
are we going to get action out of the administration 
kennedy dmass asked the drug policy coordinator 
i think there are very serious constitutional problems 
bennett responded 
the bush administration already has banned the import of a number 
of foreignmade assault rifles but has balked at shutting off us 
manufacturing amid a heavy lobbying campaign from the national rifle 
association 
the presidents antidrug strategy itself brought surprisingly 
little fireworks at the hearing although democrats have complained 
over the last several days that the bush administrations plans for 
financing it were insufficient 
bennett told a packed national press club audience wednesday that 
biden revealed no substantive disagreements with the strategy in 
his democratic response to the bush plan aired tuesday night 
biden said the bush plan isnt bold enough but its a good 
start 
as for those who say the 79 billion is inadequate to fight the 
war on drugs bennett said im just not going to be all that 
receptive to criticism of the figure of 8 billion from people whose 
correct mark is 6 billion 
bennett said the strategy if pursued consistently over time 
will enable the country to win the war against drugs but he 
cautioned that it wont happen quickly with any batman through the 
transom flashy solutions 
the strategy which congress had directed bennett to develop 
calls for a law enforcement crackdown on all levels of drug 
trafficking from drug kingpins overseas to casual users in america 
it seeks a 53 percent increase in funding for treatment programs a 
25 percent increase in prevention efforts and a vast expansion of 
the federal prison system to house drug offenders 
the strategy also calls for 261 million next year in military 
and law enforcement aid to colombia peru and bolivia the three 
main cocaineproducing countries the administration plans to offer 
those countries some 2 billion more over the next five years once 
they demonstrate solid efforts to cut down on drug trafficking 
meanwhile bush on wednesday visited the district of columbia 
general hospitals pediatrics ward and cradled one of about a dozen 
infants who were abandoned after birth by mothers addicted to drugs 
the babies after being cured of their own drug dependencies 
still must wait for months until foster care can be found for them 
sen ted stevens ralaska temporarily halted a senate effort to 
bolster treatment programs by cutting funds for congressional 
mailings the measure proposed by republicans and accepted by 
democrats would reduce the 80 million proposed for next years 
congressional mail transferring 45 million of it to a treatment 
program for pregnant women addicted to crack cocaine and other drugs 
a vote was blocked by stevens ralaska who argued that such a 
cut would deprive alaskans of an important source of news 
the american civil liberties union said the drug strategy will 
compromise civil liberties and will be counterproductive and 
cynical shortchanging prevention and treatment programs while 
putting overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice system 
donald fiedler national director of the national organization 
for the reform of marijuana laws said the program declares war on 
at least 25 million fellow citizens who are leading productive lives 
but for their casual or regular use of marijuana 
also the drug enforcement administration said drug agents have 
detected a sharp increase in cocaine prices in miami over the past 
few weeks but are not yet ready to say whether the colombian 
governments crackdown on traffickers has disrupted the business 
the retail price of cocaine in south florida has gone from an 
average of 11000 to 16000 per kilogram to about 20000 based 
on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms dea spokesman frank shults said

the son of the late ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini today ruled out relations between iran and the united 
states and said irans new president hashemi rafsanjani is 
undoubtedly antiamerican 
ahmad khomeini 43 appeared to be trying to rally radicals 
against conciliatory moves toward the west expected from rafsanjani 
who is associated with the socalled pragmatist camp in postwar iran 
hatred of the united states referred to in iran as the great 
satan is strong among radicals who favor maintaining 
revolutionary islamic fervor 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted khomeini as saying 
you know well the higher authorities of the country and our dear 
president if our president is not antiamerican who in iran is 
he spoke at a meeting with families of soldiers who died in the 
eightyear persian gulf war 
khomeini added that rafsanjani is not a person to take even one 
step outside the path of the imam and against his guidance the 
radio reported 
iranians regarded ayatollah ruhollah khomeini as a supreme 
spiritual leader or imam before his death on june 3 he preached a 
staunchly antiamerican doctrine that ruled out any ties with 
washington 
his sons description of rafsanjanis antiamerican credentials 
would seem to make any friendly gesture toward the united states 
more difficult 
rafsanjani elected july 28 is known to want to shed irans 
radical image abroad to end tehrans international isolation and 
to attract foreign investment and technology to rebuild the 
countrys warbattered economy 
rafsanjani recently won parliamentary approval for a 22man 
cabinet consisting largely of technocrats many westerneducated 
and his administration is making positive gestures to ease strains 
with some foes 
earlier this week irans deputy foreign minister ali mohammad 
besharati said 16 western hostages including eight americans 
being held in lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem groups could be 
freed if washington releases billions of dollars in frozen iranian 
assets washington has made the release of the hostages a condition 
for improving ties with iran 
the younger khomeini used to act as a spokesman for his father 
and was expected to become part of the senior leadership when his 
father died 
but he has no official role and is considered more of a symbol 
for the hardline elements with which he has allied himself

investigators are trying to determine 
whether the ohio state fairs grand champion steer hank also goes 
by the name carl a ribbon winner at an illinois farm show 
the key piece of evidence is a patch of white hair on hanks 
underside that had been dyed black an ohio state fair official said 
coloring the animals hide is itself a violation but fair 
officials are also investigating whether hank was shown as carl 
three weeks earlier at the iroquois county fair in illinois where 
it won a secondplace ribbon 
if the allegation is true the prize steer violates the rules of 
both fairs because it was shown by different families and because it 
fails to meet ownership requirements an exhibitor must own and care 
for the animal as of jan 1 to show at either fair 
the ohio 4h the future farmers of america and the state fair 
have been gathering evidence for more than two weeks 
when officials examined the ohio fairs grand champion steer 
after the competition aug 14 a dark dye was wiped from the steers 
abdomen the darkcolored hairs have grown out 
it is white jim goard director of livestock and agriculture 
for the state fair said wednesday it needs to match the spots on 
pictures of the animal from illinois but it appears to be white 
and coloring an animal is a major violation in itself 
a white spot was visible in photos of carl shown by jeremy 
simmons 12 at the iroquois county fair on july 24 
hank was shown by susan shealy 17 of tiro who could be forced 
to forfeit her firstplace ribbon and the 28000 price the 
anguscross steer brought at the fair her family could be banned 
from showing at the fair for three or more years 
jeremy of donovan ill also could face a penalty 
both families deny any wrongdoing 
hank has been in the custody of ohio state university while his 
hair grows out investigators visited osus beef barn tuesday to 
photograph the steer in postures similar to the stances shown in 
photos of the illinois winner 
jeremys father donald kopsell has said carl was destroyed 
after eating tainted corn 
state fair rules require investigators to make a recommendation 
to the fairs beef sheep and swine committee the committee must 
recommend action to the ninemember ohio expositions commission 
which runs the fair 
if they call for a hearing all parties will be notified and 
given a chance to tell their side of the story jack foust 
general manager of the fair

the morton h meyerson symphony center is im 
peis first concert hall a onceinacentury opportunity and the 
world famous architect knows he may never have a chance to do it 
again 
there arent that many concert halls built in this world the 
72yearold designer said 
but would he do another 
i tell you you know never say never no i dont know but 
i dont think i would be seeking it as much as i once would because 
i have done it 
pei whose buildings include the john f kennedy library in 
boston the east wing of the national gallery of art and the new 
louvre in paris speaks lovingly of the new dallas symphony hall and 
the opportunity it presented to him 
i would have to say that this is one of the great buildings 
that i have had the fortune to design he said he received a 10 
million commission for the meyerson center in 1982 
pei likes the feel of the 2065seat music chamber it is more 
vertical than horizontal and he says it lends intimacy to the room 
the public areas outside the music chamber presented the greatest 
design challenge for pei the lobby area curves around the music 
chamber in a series of pieces of circles overlooked by glass that 
curves and sweeps the area i havent done a work that has had 
such a complex geometry he said 
ieoh ming pei was born in china his creations fuse environment 
with structure 
he attributes his rise in architectural circles to his first big 
break in 1969 the commission for the kennedy library pei was not 
wellknown at the time and the decision to bypass other masters for 
him was so surprising that jacqueline kennedy onassis felt it 
necessary to explain the decision 
from there he received commissions for the christian science 
church center and the john hancock tower in boston and the east 
building of the national gallery of art in washington 
with the addition of the symphony hall there are six pei 
buildings in the dallas area the arco tower one dallas centre 
city hall the allied bank tower and the field research center for 
mobil oil co only boston and nearby cambridge have more pei 
structures 10

a british investigation of kurt waldheims 
world war ii actions contradicts deputy prime minister geoffrey 
howes finding that the austrian presidents military unit did not 
torture british commandos a jewish organization said thursday 
howe told parliament in 1986 when he was foreign secretary that 
four british commandos captured in nazioccupied greece were held by 
the german gestapo secret police rather than by waldheims 
wehrmacht or armed forces unit 
the new british defense ministry report ordered by prime minister 
margaret thatcher includes german war records which show the 
commandos were transferred to waldheims unit in the greek town of 
salonika said the world jewish congress 
the defense ministry said only that it will release its report on 
the investigation in a few weeks 
the wjc which was instrumental in the 1986 campaign to expose 
waldheims past as a nazi officer said it had been informed about 
the contents of the british report and supplied some of the 
documents on which the report is based 
records show waldheims duties as an intelligence officer 
included prisoner interrogation the wjc said 
in written testimony to the us justice department waldheim 
contended there were no interrogations at his units headquarters 
nevertheless in 1987 the justice department placed waldheim on a 
list of people barred from the united states after finding he 
participated in the execution of hostages and mistreatment of allied 
prisoners 
howe wrote british member of parliament greville janner in 1986 
that his own investigation had determined the four commandos were 
held in a gestapo jail but the defense ministry study says there 
was no gestapo jail in salonika and the men were not interrogated by 
the gestapo the wjc said 
according to the report the british prisoners suffered ill 
treatment at the hands of wermacht personnel working at the 
detention center the wjc said

the government offered a 250000 reward 
for the capture of two cocaine barons and said today it would 
appoint a military mayor in a town infested with death squads 
employed by drug traffickers 
meanwhile a reputed money launderer for the medellin cocaine 
cartel arrived in the united states the first person extradited 
from colombia during the recent crackdown on drug traffickers 
two men on a motorcycle tossed a bomb made of dynamite at the 
banco central hipotecario in medellin the cocaine center of the 
nation said a medellin police official who identified himself only 
as cardona his last name 
the blast wednesday night caused 45000 in damage and came just 
a few hours after authorities defied drug traffickers threats and 
carried out the extradition 
the government said wednesday night that president virgilio barco 
would use his state of siege powers to name military mayors of 
violenceplagued cities 
today alvaro garcia spokesman for the governors office of 
boyaca state said mayor marino estrada of puerto boyaca 95 miles 
north of bogota would be summarily replaced by a military officer 
army maj alvaro matallana 
estrada was elected in march 
puerto boyaca has been a stronghold of rightwing death squads 
that the government says are controlled by colombias notorious 
cocaine cartels and it is in a region that is believed to be rife 
with cocaineprocessing laboratories in 1988 a judge order the 
arrest of luis rubio a former mayor of the town on allegations of 
links to drug traffickers rubio fled 
the opposition conservative party issued a communique declaring 
hat barcos decision to impose military rule on some towns was 
unconstitutional 
barcos liberal party has supported him in previous instances 
when he has named military governors in areas where leftist 
guerrilla violence has been prevalent 
the decree is the latest in the extraordinary measures barco has 
taken to quell violence by drug traffickers 
eduardo martinez romero who was flown out on wednesday is the 
first drug figure extradited to the united states under the special 
emergency powers decreed last month by barco 
he arrived in atlanta today under heavy guard and was being held 
at a federal courthouse pending a hearing 
martinez 35 is charged in atlanta in connection with the 
laundering of 12 billion worth of illicit cocaine cash 
highranking us diplomats and drug enforcement officials in 
bogota have said that once extraditions start they expect 
drugrelated terrorism and violence in colombia to worsen 
colombias drug lords have said they would rather die in colombia 
than suffer life in death in a us prison the traffickers 
threatened last month to kill 10 judges for every extradited drug 
suspect 
for years the traffickers had largely succeeded in evading 
justice through bribery and intimidation they have had politicians 
police judges and journalists killed and reportedly purchased 
influence in high places 
in 1987 the colombian supreme court threw out an extradition 
agreement with the united states the last colombian drug trafficker 
to be extradited the medellin cartels carlos lehder was sent to 
the united states early that year he is serving a life sentence in 
a us prison 
the extradition agreement was revived by barco last month when he 
invoked emergency powers after the assassination of sen luis carlos 
galan the leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of 
the drug lords 
barco pledged a relentless campaign against drug traffickers and 
police say the government has since virtually paralyzed cocaine 
production raiding labs and sending drug bosses into hiding 
the drug lords have declared total and absolute war on barco 
and practically the whole colombian establishment and in 
retaliation drug gangs have bombed factories newspapers 
restaurants and government installations 
the defense ministry said wednesday that in 2042 raids conducted 
against suspected drug traffickers under emergency legislation 
antinarcotics squads confiscated 1190 weapons more than 20000 
rounds of ammunition 499 cars and other vehicles 48 boats and 358 
airplanes and helicopters

olombias top cocaine barons pablo escobar and gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha 
the justice ministry showing wanted posters on television 
announced a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of 
either escobar or rodriguez gacha both are wanted by the united 
states and both are in hiding 
all tips will be absolutely confidential and all calls will 
be tollfree the government announcement said 
fortune magazine has estimated escobars net worth at 3 billion 
the national security council the day before issued a ban on 
public demonstrations in bogota the capital and largest city with 6 
million people 
colombian impresarios reported a rash of cancellations due to 
the unstable situation here by foreign artists and entertainers who 
had scheduled colombian appearances 
in a statement on wednesday barco called president bushs 
support for colombias war on drugs a very favorable start but 
said the key to the battle is to stop drug use in the united states 
barco called the united states one of the countries that has 
the greatest number of drug addicts 
he was responding directly to the 79 billion drug initiative 
bush announced tuesday night which pledged financial and even 
military support to this violenceplagued republic that produces 80 
percent of the cocaine consumed in the united states

the united states and the worlds industrial 
democracies should send economic business and labor experts to 
poland to help that nations new noncommunist government establish 
a free economy sen pete domenici said thursday 
the new mexico republican explained his proposal as other 
lawmakers urged the bush administration to expand the modest package 
of aid it has earmarked for poland as a critical signal of political 
support 
domenici said the team of experts he envisions would make a 
complete but speedy survey of polands largely statecontrolled 
economy and recommend basic changes needed to spur investment and 
free enterprise 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said many of the 
polish leaders he spoke with when he visited warsaw last month asked 
for just such help 
polands leaders including its communist leaders are wide 
open to new american investment said dole 
dole said the bush administration is considering ways to expand 
the 100 million aid package the president announced in warsaw 
earlier this summer 
i am convinced we can take some additional steps at no cost and 
perhaps also find some additional resources within existing budgets 
and programs dole said 
he said although poland needs longterm help especially to ease 
the strain caused by payments on its 39 billion foreign debt 
shortterm aid is essential 
there cannot be a longterm approach unless polands government 
makes it through the short term dole said thats where an 
immediate american signal of support can be critical 
we in the united states and our allies in western europe and 
japan have a big security political and economic stake in what 
happens in poland dole said 
if solidarity remains in power and succeeds in governing the 
threat of war in central europe will go down democratization in 
hungary elsewhere in eastern europe and even in the soviet union 
itself will get a big boost and the prospects for expanded private 
investment in and trade with poland will grow he said 
meanwhile sen paul simon dill urged support for his 
threestep plan to send us assistance to poland 
simon introduced legislation wednesday which would postpone 
interest payments on polands 28 billion debt to us banks for 
three years and defer half of the interest payments due in the 
following two years 
the proposal also calls for establishment of an investment fund 
to distribute 300 million for development projects in poland for 
each of three years it would also call for spending 25 million to 
help poland modernize its telephone system

acting president fw de klerk 
today said the results of national elections show that most white 
voters support his plan to grant some political rights to blacks 
despite his partys worst showing in 41 years 
black activists said at least 25 people were killed in clashes 
with police during protests of the elections wednesday from which 
blacks were excluded 
the governing national party narrowly retained its parliamentary 
majority in the balloting losing nearly a quarter of its seats in 
the dominant white chamber t antiapartheid and hardline 
segregationist parties 
with votes counted in all of 166 election districts it appeared 
the nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123 
seats in parliament 
the conservatives who want stricter enforcement of segregation 
laws and oppose any political rights for blacks improved from 22 to 
39 seats 
the democratic party which seeks an end to apartheid laws but 
wants some guarantees that whites and other minorities would retain 
a voice in the government went from 20 seats to 33 seats the jump 
was the biggest ever for an antiapartheid faction 
in one rural district officials announced another election would 
be held to settle a tie between conservative and national party 
candidates 
protesting their disenfranchisement blacks on wednesday observed 
a nationwide general strike that antiapartheid leaders called the 
biggest antigovernment protest ever with 3 million people taking 
part 
violence flared in many black and mixedrace areas around cape 
town and white riot police were seen marching through townships 
firing in all directions 
cape town attorney essa moosa said 25 black and mixedrace people 
had been killed in violence in seven townships 
police said 12 deaths occurred in the cape town area seven 
during violence associated with a feud between factions in the black 
township of khayelitsha and five during mob violence of unknown 
origin in three mixedrace townships 
police said four police officers were slightly injured and that 
more than 50 people were arrested 
mr de klerks presidents seat sits now in a pool of blood 
said rev allan boesak a mixedrace antiapartheid activist in cape 
town people who begin a new term of office with a massacre of 
people have no right to be in government 
jay naidoo general secretary of the 980000member congress of 
south african trade unions and a leader of the defiance campaign 
called the police response to the protests brutal and said of 
the government they have to deal with us as human beings and 
respect our dignity and sense of justice or there will not be any 
peace in our country 
alfred mzo secretarygeneral of the outlawed african national 
congress guerrilla group praised the huge opposition to the 
elections and said the groups call for a boycott resulted in low 
turnout among mixrace and indian voters 
of historic significance for the future of south africa is the 
massive challenge of the oppressed working people who in their 
millions stayed away from work as a massive protest against the 
undemocratic nature of the elections he said during news 
conference today in belgrade yugoslavia where he was attending a 
summit of nonaligned nations 
hospitals and monitoring groups said more than 100 people were 
hurt as riot squads used whips tear gas and shotguns to stop 
peaceful antielection rallies and disperse stonethrowing crowds in 
more than 20 townships 
archbishop desmond tutu said he had warned western nations that 
there would be chaos in south africa and urged them to act 
against the government he said de klerk should condemn the police 
actions and express sorrow and condolences to people who have 
suffered this bereavement 
de klerk who is expected to be chosen by an electoral college 
next week to serve a fiveyear term as president described the 
election results as a clear mandate for his partys plans for 
gradual political reform and said the government now should open 
negotiations with blacks 
seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring 
renewal and reform and granting political rights he said 
today linking his party with the liberalminded democrats 
during the campaign de klerk had associated the nationalists 
with the rightwing conservatives saying that in the 1987 white 
election 80 percent of voters had shown a preference for those 
parties promises to enforce segregation 
de klerks campaign platform called for limited black 
participation in national politics within five years however he 
rejects a oneperson onevote system leading to black majority rule 
and supports maintaining segregated schools and and neighborhoods 
the implementation of a comprehensive economic action plan 
together with political development will get our country on the road 
of prosperity again de klerk told a news conference 
however he would not answer a question about how the government 
would begin negotiations after the tough police action against 
blacks during five weeks of protests leading up to the election 
the government handled the defiance campaign with aplomb and in 
a very reasonable way de klerk said 
of south africas 37 million people 5 million are white 28 
million black about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of 
indian descent under apartheid blacks have no vote in national 
affairs and maintain separate districts schools and health services 
about 69 percent of the 3160667 registered white voters cast 
ballots in the election and for the first time since 1953 the 
nationalists received less than a majority of the white vote they 
won 486 percent to 313 percent for the conservatives and 20 
percent for the democrats 
also at stake were seats in parliaments the mixedrace and 
indian chambers which were established in 1984 and have little 
power antiapartheid activists also called for a boycott of the 
nonwhite elections 
incumbents won most races but national party candidates 
generally fared worse than in the white election of 1987 
two prominent cabinet members foreign minister pik botha and 
defense minister magnus malan were reelected by margins sharply 
lower than 1987 
the conservatives lost by only five votes in vereeniging de 
klerks former district they failed to win some seats they had 
targeted and fell far short of the 50 to 60 seats they had expected 
but they won their first seats in pretoria the capital nd their 
first seats in cape province and the orange free state previously 
they held seats only in transvaal the most populous of the four 
provinces

chased her hitting her their was an elderly man who collapsed 
because of the beating

to defuse trouble by telling the students they could do their 
thing and then disperse in 20 minutes

that another squad repeatedly charged into the normal curious 
crowds including shoppers 
they were just hitting people they couldnt care if they were 
innocent bystanders or not rockman said they were running 
after them even when they were fleeing hitting them 
it seemed to me that they were enjoying themselves feasting on 
the people you could just see the killer instinct in their eyes 
cape town police maj gen phillipus fourie confirmed that 
rockman had been summoned to his office wednesday to discuss police 
matters but he would not comment further 
tutu said that rockman could face retaliation but that he was 
going to be given very wide recognition in the black community

ptl raised nearly 17 million in one week 
during 1986 but its heritage grand hotel was almost constantly 
short of cash the jury in jim bakkers fraud trial was told today 
the testimony came after a day after the judge pronounced the tv 
evangelist competent to stand trial a government psychiatrist had 
testified that bakker suffered a panic attack last week but is 
not going crazy 
delores jones who worked in ptls cash management office 
testified this morning that during the week of may 31 1986 the 
ministry collected 13000 from passing the plate at sunday services 
and 7000 from the tv audience of the jim and tammy show 
it was sometimes more sometimes less she said when asked 
whether the 20000 in cash collections for the week were unusual 
ms jones said the rest of the 17 million would have to be the 
lifetime silver 1000 account one of several lifetime 
partnership programs that offered 1000 contributors three 
nights free lodging each year for life 
prosecutors say bakker and other ptl executives diverted to their 
own use more than 4 million of the 158 million raised by 
partnerships from 1984 to 1987 if convicted on all counts bakker 
could receive 120 years in prison and more than 5 million in fines 
william maybrey general manager of heritage grand hotel in 
198485 testified today that the management contract with brock 
hotel corp required that half the 500 rooms be set aside for 
lifetime partners brock employed maybrey to run the hotel 
he said ptl had agreed to keep a 300000 balance in an operating 
account for the hotel but he warned bakker in two memos in 1985 
that the account was at least 195000 short of the requirement 
brock had to pay employees out of its own funds at one point because 
of the shortages maybrey testified 
it was difficult to balance the level of services with the cash 
flow problems we were experiencing said maybrey 
last week us district judge robert potter committed bakker to 
a federal prison for psychiatric evaluation after his lawyers 
reported he was hallucinating and cowering under a couch after a 
competency hearing wednesday out of sight of the jury potter 
released bakker 
he is not going crazy dr sally johnson head of the 
psychiatric team at the federal correctional institution in butner 
told the judge he has no hidden mental illness the stress that 
hes feeling is normal 
ms johnson said she didnt think bakker had faked his breakdown 
she said bakker told her that journalists at the courthouse took on 
the form of frightening animals 
in wednesdays testimony former fundraiser carol price broke 
into tears when she described trying to discourage an elderly woman 
from purchasing a 1000 lifetime partnership she said she was 
fired for complaining about ptl policy 
i told her that selling a burial policy to buy a lifetime 
partnership was not a good idea ms price said wednesday 
former ptl vice president steve nelson whose fainting episode on 
the stand last week was cited by doctors as triggering bakkers 
breakdown returned to testify wednesday 
nelson said he had gone to bakker and former ptl vice president 
richard dortch with concerns over the number of lifetime 
partnerships sold at the 500room heritage grand hotel 
i told them we had problems getting people in there he said 
i told them we could not sell more memberships 
ms price testified that workers were encouraged to sell as many 
partnerships as they could regardless of whether the hotel could 
accommodate them 
ms price who was in charge of handling partner relations said 
she took her concerns to bakker on several occasions she said that 
when she and 10 members of her staff were fired in 1985 she asked 
nelson her boss at the time why she was let go 
he leaned back in his chair and said thats the price you pay 
for knowing too much and not keeping your mouth shut she said 
crying ten people lost their jobs because my conscience wouldnt 
let me keep my mouth shut i carry that with me to this day 
bakker who said he was suffering from the flu appeared more 
alert during wednesdays testimony he smiled chatted with 
attorneys and reviewed documents 
he showed little emotion during the morning competency hearing 
sometimes hanging his head and staring at the floor 
bakker who resigned from the ptl ministry in 1987 in a 
sexandmoney scandal went on trial aug 28 
prosecutors contend bakker oversold the partnerships and used 
nearly 4 million in ministry funds to live in high style

they are the naval supply center which supplies pacific fleet 
ships with components for nuclear weapons and a department of 
energy operations office overseeing weapons research at the lawrence 
livermore national laboratory east of oakland 
but steve bloom primary author of the ballot initiative said 
the measure approved by voters in november was drafted to exclude 
the naval supply center where more than 2000 people work 
and city attorney jayne williams said the ban on nuclear weapons 
work covered such activities as creating nuclear weapons in their 
offices and should not apply to an administrative office like the 
does 
the lawsuit said the constitution gives the federal government 
exclusive authority over defense the lawsuit also said the atomic 
energy act gives the federal government sole authority over nuclear 
weapons and nuclear energy 
the ballot initiatives sponsors countered that local communities 
also have rights 
we should be able to exercise the full power of local 
governments to protect our health and safety and to direct policy 
about what happens in our city jurisdictions said madge strong of 
the nuclearfree oakland coalition 
bloom added that the first amendment should take precedence 
the people of an entire city are saying we dont want this 
going on the federal government is saying you have no right to say 
that that ceases to be democracy bloom said 
williams the city attorney called oaklands nuclearfree 
ordinance one of the broadest in the country among other things it 
bans nuclear weapons work in the city in two years 
williams said she believed it was the first such ordinance the 
federal government has challenged a conservative legal group filed 
a federal lawsuit challenging it four months ago

the judging system of the miss america 
pageant has changed so much that a retired statistics professor has 
stopped his tradition of predicting who the new miss america will be 
george l miller of bellevue wash who retired in 1984 from 
northern illinois university says his statistical model was thrown 
off balance by the decreasing emphasis on swimsuits and additional 
emphasis on brains 
the interview counts for 30 percent this year and i cant get 
any information related to the interviews said miller the 
swimsuit counts only for 15 percent this year theyve downgraded 
swimsuits so much that it took care of poor old george 
each year miller 66 compiled statistics on every miss america 
contestant and past winners tallying up a composite to set odds on 
woman might win his first year he correctly predicted cheryl 
prewitt would be crowned miss america 1980 he then named four more 
winners over the next nine years 
but in the past few years his statistical odds have failed he 
gave little hope to the past two winners saying a tahitian dancer 
and a violinist had little chance of capturing the crown they did 
and the dancer miss america 1988 kaye lani rae rafko turned out 
to be millers favorite so far 
miller used various statistics to devise his predictions 
including height weight hair and eye color academic major and 
talent he was forced to stop using bust waist and hip measurements 
after the pageant stopped releasing those figures three years ago 
despite the changes he said in some ways theyre improving 
the pageant 
theyre getting better people they seem brighter and come from 
better schools 
last years winner gretchen elizabeth carlson attends stanford 
university and hopes to go to law school this years winner is to 
be crowned sept 16 
pageant officials were never pleased at millers uninvited annual 
prediction leonard horn director of the miss america pageant was 
not disappointed to learn miller would not pick a winner this year 
the fact that hes decided not to do it proves these young 
women are individuals with varying degrees of talents and positive 
characters horn said 
miller said he will switch from beauty queens to baseball some 
people may think im backsliding but some may think im moving 
forward he said

the pilot of a jetliner that crashed in havana 
and killed 170 people took off in severe winds against the control 
towers advice cuban news reports said thursday 
the sovietmade cubana de aviacion jet crashed into a suburb off 
the end of the runway sunday all but one of the 126 people on board 
died and 45 people on the ground were killed 
gen rogelio acevedo head of the cuban government commission 
investigating the sunday crash said winds up to 30 mph near the end 
of the jose marti airport runway in havana were believed to be the 
basic cause of the crash the cuban government news agency prensa 
latina said 
the tower advised the pilot capt armando oliveros to wait 
before leaving and the commission thinks his decision to take off 
was in error the agency quoted acevedo as saying 
luigi capalbo 22 of parma italy was the only survivor on the 
ilyushin 62 doctors at hermanos ameijeiras hospital were treating 
him for head injuries burns over 65 percent of his body and a 
broken left leg 
acevedo who is president of the civil aeronautics institute 
said the pilot faced with winds of 28 to 30 mph and heavy rain 
reduced the angle of the wing flaps apparently to gain speed but 
wind drove the plane down 
a tail wheel struck the runway and the right wing hit an antenna 
at the end of the runway the plane then lifted slightly clearing a 
concrete median on a major street and plunged into homes he said 
two square blocks were destroyed 
no indication was found of mechanical problems on the 7monthold 
plane which had been flown 1300 hours he said 
oliveros 51 had been flying 29 years and instructed other 
pilots the news agency said 
builders of the plane arrived early thursday from the soviet 
union to aid cuban and italian teams in the investigation one of 
their tasks will be to analyze data on the three flight recorders 
that were recovered

the head of du page countys animal control 
department wants every dog or cat to have a chip in its shoulder 
daniel boyle said he would ask the county board to approve an 
ordinance requiring that microchip ids be implanted in all animals 
that bite someone and all pets reclaimed or adopted from the 
countys animal shelter 
boyle said he would also try to persuade pet owners and 
veterinarians to voluntarily implant the chips in all dogs and cats 
to help identify them 
this is going to be essentially the ultimate id boyle said 
wednesday since the dog cant talk maybe his chip can talk for 
him 
if approved the county would register the id numbers of all the 
microchipped pets 
the chips are manfuactured by a california company american 
veterinary indentification devices inc 
hannis stoddard a veterinarian and chief executive officer of 
the company said the chips have been implanted in 5000 prize 
hunting falcons owned by a sheik of the united arab emirates 
its the only unalterable id that can be used safely and 
humanely for animals and it does not scar or disfigure them 
stoddard said 
the microchip about the size of a grain of rice is injected via 
a syringe into the fatty tissue above the shoulder or hip of a dog 
or cat the number on the microchip can be read by a handheld 
scanner 
boyle said a microchip injection by a veterinarian would cost 20 
to 25

a state judge today ruled that the bush 
administration the most powerful opponent to gov mario cuomos 
plan to tear down the shoreham nuclear plant may enter the state 
court fight against the agreement 
supreme court justice f warren travers ruled that the federal 
department of energy was an interested party through its 
ownership of the brookhaven national laboratory on long island 
there was no immediate word from the cuomo administration on 
whether it will appeal 
cuomo has sought to prevent the 55 billion plant on long island 
from operating because of concern over whether the region can be 
safely evacuated 
under a deal negotiated by cuomo and the long island lighting 
co the state will buy the plant for 1 and have it dismantled in 
return lilco gets at least a decades worth of annual rate 
increases of about 10 percent its customers already pay among the 
highest electric rates in the nation 
if the deal goes through and it has already been approved by the 
required state agencies and lilco stockholders it will be the first 
time a completed nuclear plant was torn down without having gone 
into commercial operation 
in his ruling travers noted that brookhaven lies on 5000 acres 
of federal land and that the doe intends to purchase 41000 megawatt 
hours of electricity from the long island lighting co this year at 
a cost of more than 3 million 
here where doe is a landowner and user of power provided by 
lilco the court in its discretion determines that doe should be 
allowed to and is granted permission to intervene said travers 
last week state lawyers argued that doe intervention would be 
superfluous and that interested parties were all represented in 
a lawsuit filed against the shoreham deal by the conservative 
atlantic legal foundation 
the lawsuit before travers argues among other things that cuomo 
usurped the power of the legislature in negotiating the shoreham 
deal and that there should have been a state environmental impact 
statement 
travers has yet to rule on the merits of those arguments

against net parent company nynex corp for about six weeks but

clayton hartwigs family today rejected the 
navys conclusion that the gunners mate probably caused the 
explosion that killed 47 sailors on the uss iowa by shoving a 
detonator between gunpowder bags 
i never believed it right from the start kathy kubicina 
hartwigs sister said outside her fathers home following a 
twohour briefing by navy officers this morning i didnt really 
hear anything i didnt hear before 
the family attorney kraig brusnahan said hartwigs relatives 
want a congressional investigation into the navy probe of the april 
19 blast aboard the battleship and repeated leaks to the news media 
from investigators 
the navy is kind of investigating itself and clearing itself 
said brusnahan 
hartwigs father earl v hartwig a navy veteran also said he 
didnt believe the navy conclusion i think there was a powder 
explosion accidental that caused the explosion hartwig said 
the family was briefed at hartwigs home by a threeofficer team 
led by capt douglas j katz 
this is probably one of the hardest things ive ever done in my 
entire life said katz who left the home a half hour before the 
pentagon released the report on the april 19 disaster off puerto 
rico 
the report said the exact cause of the explosion the worst naval 
disaster since the vietnam war cannot be pinpointed since the 
sailors close enough to see what was going on including hartwig 
were all killed in the fiery blast 
however rear adm richard milligan presenting the conclusions 
in washington said there was much circumstantial information 
pointing to hartwig 
he cited an fbi psychological profile of hartwig with the 
opinion that he took his own life and hoped it looked like an 
accident 
navy investigators had been examining the possibility that 
suicide or murder was involved in the explosion

a reputed moneylaunderer for the medellin cocaine 
cartel arrived in the united states under heavy guard today at a 
tiny suburban airport the first person extradited from colombia in 
its recent drug crackdown 
eduardo martinez romero who is accused of helping the drug 
cartel launder at least 15 million later appeared with a lawyer at 
a preliminary federal court hearing telling magistrate joel m 
feldman through an interpreter that he speaks only spanish and does 
not fully understand the charges against him 
feldman postponed arraignment until monday and ordered martinez 
held without bail until then prosecutors said they would ask that 
he be denied bail then they would not say disclose where martinez 
was being held 
martinez left bogota aboard a drug enforcement administration 
plane on wednesday night federal officials said 
us attorney robert barr of atlanta said the plane landed under 
tight security just outside atlanta today at charlie brown airport 
a small countyrun airport used by private planes martinez was 
whisked away in a helicopter 
he appeared in court without handcuffs or leg irons additional 
officers were in the courtroom and security appeared higher but not 
extraordinarily so 
federal agents were on an increased state of alert for any 
retaliation from the medellin cartel said weldon kennedy agent in 
charge of the fbi in atlanta 
were very concerned because of the events transpiring and 
because of the violence that has occurred in colombia kennedy 
said 
he said some cartel members reportedly have said there might be 
some violent act attempted in the united states because of the 
extradition 
martinez was arrested the first weekend after colombian president 
virgilio barco launched a crackdown on drug traffickers triggered by 
the aug 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate luis 
carlos galan an outspoken foe of the drug trade 
the bogota newspaper el tiempo quoted martinez after his arrest 
as saying he was innocent 
at no time have i had links to the medellin cartel and i dont 
know any of its members he said 
in the emergency measures imposed by barco was a reinstitution of 
the extradition agreement with the united states that had been 
thrown out by the colombian supreme court in 1987 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement late 
wednesday i applaud the extraordinary courage and resolve of 
president virgilio barco and the government of colombia in their 
efforts to restore the rule of law to colombia 
martinez 36 was indicted in march in atlanta as a result of an 
investigation codenamed operation polar cap that federal officials 
said revealed an operation that laundered billions of dollars in 
cocaine profits through us and foreign banks charges were brought 
against 127 people and two latin american banks as a result of that 
investigation 
drug traffickers in colombia who supply an estimated 80 percent 
of the cocaine consumed in the united states are said to fear 
extradition to the united states because they believe they will not 
be able to escape conviction and prison sentences 
in response to barcos crackdown the traffickers declared 
total war on the government and have carried out bombings and 
shootings in medellin home of the worlds largest drug cartel and 
the second largest city in the country and in bogota the largest 
and the capital 
the last trafficker to be extradited was carlos lehder a leader 
of the medellin cartel who was sent to the united states in 1987 and 
is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in marion ill 
the us government responded to the outbreak of violence in 
colombia by sending 65 million equipment and other aid airplanes 
helicopters and vehicles as well as military advisers to the south 
american country 
in addition plans were accelerated to send some 25 million 
worth of help to protect colombian judges dozens of whom have been 
killed by drug gangs 
in his national drug control strategy announced tuesday night 
bush said military and law enforcement aid to colombia peru and 
bolivia would increase from an estimated 53 million this year to 
261 million next year the administration also promised an 
additional 2 billion over the next five years to the three 
countries if they demonstrated their commitment to cracking down on 
drugs 
meanwhile the dea said wednesday that drug agents have detected 
a sharp increase in cocaine prices in miami over the past few weeks 
but theyre not ready to say whether it is due to the crackdown on 
traffickers 
the retail price of cocaine in south florida has gone from an 
average of 11000 to 16000 per kilogram to about 20000 based 
on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms said dea spokesman frank shults 
whether colombias crackdown on traffickers is actually stemming 
the flow of drugs into the united states the price increase 
probably has been enhanced by that effort shults said 
it may just be individual entrepreneurs capitalizing on 
perceived market pressures he said

a chinese air force pilot who flew a mig19 
jet to taiwan said thursday he defected because of his contempt for 
the communist government after its suppression of a movement for 
democracy 
lt chiang wenhao 24 told reporters he sympathizes with the 
soldiers who carried out the crackdown in june saying they had to 
follow government orders 
i dont want to dedicate my blood and my life to a communist 
regime that the people spit on in contempt said chiang 
for the defection taiwain will pay him 206 pounds of gold worth 
about 880000 taiwan has a sliding scale of gold rewards for 
chinese military defectors calculated on the type of aircraft they 
bring out 
chiang flew his sovietbuilt fighter to the nationalistheld 
island of quemoy on wednesday from longxi airport in chinas 
southern fujian province just over a mile away the flight took 14 
minutes 
he was brought to taipei on thursday for a news conference and 
told reporters he had planned to defect for two years but was 
spurred to action by the june crackdown on the studentled democracy 
movement at tiananmen square in beijing 
after taking off chiang said he kept the fighter low to escape 
pursuing aircraft but the chinese air force apparently did not 
notice he had left 
i was so nervous that i didnt know if anyone followed me he 
said i could still hear the air bases communications when i 
landed at quemoy airport 
chiang said he left his parents a sister and his grandmother 
behind 
in beijing chinese foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said 
the press reports about the plane are under investigation by the 
departments concerned 
chiang defended the chinese military which fired on thousands of 
residents in beijing on june 34 
the military stood beside the people and supported the 
prodemocracy movement but they had to carry out orders from 
authorities he said they executed orders against their own 
will i sympathize with the soldiers they were but the tools to 
execute the orders of the chinese communist party 
china says about 300 people died in the street clashes including 
unspecified dozens of security personnel and more than 200 
civilians western security sources say the death toll may have been 
3000 
four women from the opposition democratic progressive party 
draped a banner outside the conference room protesting chiangs 
entry to taiwan they said the government should not welcome 
communists while barring many taiwanese political dissidents from 
returning home 
the last chinese pilot to defect to taiwan liu chihyuan 30 
also flew a mig19 when he fled in 1987 the nationalist government 
rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold then valued at about 3 
million liu now a member of taiwans air force was at the news 
conference to show support for chiang 
last year gold rewards were cut by more than 50 percent after 
china abolished a similar practice of rewarding defectors from 
taiwan 
officials said 14 chinese military personnel have defected to 
taiwan since 1949 when the nationalists fled to this island after 
losing a civil war to the communist forces on mainland china 
china regards taiwan as a renegade province and the two 
technically still are at war 
more than a dozen nationalist air force officers have sought 
asylum in china since 1949 the most recent nationalist defection 
was in february when lt col lin xianshun parachuted to safety as 
his f5e jet crashed in a rice paddy in guangdong province

a soviet general who reportedly ordered an army 
assault that killed 19 demonstrators in the georgian city of tbilisi 
in april has been removed from his post officials said thursday 
col gen igor rodionov who was head of the transcaucasian 
military district was replaced by col gen valery o patrikeyev 
said an editor at the official gruzinform news agency in tbilisi 
the capital of the georgian republic 
spokesman vyacheslav kirillov of the soviet defense ministrys 
international relations department confirmed that rodionov had been 
removed 
neither had any information on patrikeyev 
nationalists have accused rodionov of ordering soldiers armed 
with shovels and irritating gas to attack a crowd on tbilisis 
rustavelli prospekt the night of april 9 
the protest was a demonstration for more autonomy for the 
republic nineteen people were killed in the assault and another 
young man was shot for violating a curfew that was imposed later 
rodionov was chosen a representative to the national congress of 
peoples deputies parliament in march and he staunchly defended 
himself during debate on the assault at the congress first session 
rodionov said the protest turned into a pure orgy with 
antisoviet slogans appeals to overturn the government appeals 
to exterminate communists 
a georgian commission accused the military of a planned mass 
massacre 
the removal of rodionov also was noted in a dispatch by the tass 
news agency in a report on foreign minister eduard a shevardnadzes 
visit to georgia 
tass said shevardnadze told georgian party officials they had 
made progress in mending ethnic relations since april but that it 
still was the most difficult problem they face 
the foreign minister who used to be the communist party chief in 
georgia said its as if much appears quiet on the outside but 
on the inside everything is boiling and the situation continues to 
be explosive

the house eager to reward hungary for its 
steps toward economic openness and human rights voted thursday to 
grant the warsaw pact nation a threeyear extension of preferential 
trade status 
the 221169 vote over the objection of president bush sent the 
matter to the senate 
the bill would grant an extension through july 4 1992 of the 
mostfavorednation trading status hungary currently enjoys on a 
yeartoyear basis sponsors of the bill said it was time to reward 
hungarys moves toward a more westernstyle market economy and 
relatively open emigration policies 
for 25 years they have fought the communists and they have 
turned that country around and we have not done a damn thing to 
help them said rep sam gibbons dfla chairman of the ways and 
means trade subcommittee 
the original measure would have provided a fiveyear extension 
but that was scaled back in a compromise with opponents primarily 
conservative republicans who argued the gesture infringes on bushs 
right to conduct foreign policy and diminishes pressure on hungary 
to keep the reforms going 
let us remember that hungary remains a member in good standing 
of the warsaw pact said rep gerry solomon rny speaking 
against the provision 
this bill is an embarrassment to the people of hungary who have 
been fighting for their freedom they want the pressure kept on 
their government to allow them to live where they want to live work 
where they want to work move where they want to move he said 
this is a fairly delicate time said rep richard t schulze 
rpa who helped work out the threeyear compromise i dont 
think we should let the emotional euphoria over hungarian reform 
carry us into a policy we might regret 
the fiveyear version of the bill had been rejected by the house 
in june when it failed to muster the twothirds majority needed 
under the expedited floor procedure used to bring it before the 
chamber 
at the time opponents argued that bush was about to travel to 
eastern europe including budapest and planned to annouce his own 
rewards for hungary during his trip bush declared the iron 
curtain has begun to part and promised new trade benefits and a 
25 million grant to spur free enterprise 
bush said he would be inclined to grant permanent 
mostfavorednation status which offers the best tariff rates 
available if hungary adopts a liberalized emigration law now under 
consideration 
current law bars mostfavorednation status to communist 
countries with restrictive emigration policies since the ban was 
imposed in 1974 three nations have been granted waivers hungary 
romania and china 
the president of the united states went over there and put his 
good housekeeping seal of approval on it argued rep larry smith 
dfla speaking for the bill this is a country that has proven 
over and over again that it wants to be free open and democratic

representatives of the government of ethiopia and 
an eritrean rebel group began preliminary talks at the carter 
presidential center today in an effort to end the war that has raged 
between the two since 1961 
former president jimmy carter acting as an observer at the 
closeddoor talks said the two sides agreed that no statements on 
the progress of the negotiations will be made until the openended 
sessions are complete 
delegations from the government and the eritrean peoples 
liberation front appeared with carter at a news conference after 
arriving at the center 
alamin mohamed saiyed head of the eplf negotiating team said 
through an interpreter that his people want a just and peaceful 
solution to the war 
we realize that the path to peace is tortuous and requires 
patience and time the eritrean case cannot be resolved either by 
evading it or by coverups he said it cannot also be solved by 
running away from the truth or by playing some tricks 
ashegre yigletu head of the government delegation said we 
would like to affirm that the delegation is prepared to conduct 
these talks tirelessly and with the utmost patience and in a new 
spirit of broadmindedness 
carter said he did not know how long the talks would last he 
said the first order of business was an agenda 
the former president stressed that the talks here are preliminary 
and that it would take further negotiations with the top leaders of 
ethiopia and the eplf participating to produce concrete results 
both sides have limits with how far they want to go in 
atlanta he said 
an estimated 1 million people have died in the 28 years that the 
eritrean peoples liberation front has been fighting for 
independence 
eritrea a former italian colony is a province of ethiopia and 
contains the troubled east african nations only direct access to 
the red sea 
the carter center which houses the presidential library a 
museum a think tank and foundations working for peace and public 
health is trying to fill a gap by acting as gobetween in the 
dispute un intervention is limited to disputes between nations 
these are very intransigent difficult dividing issues that 
have never been addressed in a substantive way before carter said 
recently of course my hope is my expectation is that well go 
from there to fairly sustained talks that might bring about a 
ceasefire 
during his presidency carter served as a gobetween in the camp 
david talks that led to an accord between israel and egypt 
the atlanta constitution reported today that egyptian president 
hosni mubarak has been asked by both sides to serve as mediator if 
the atlanta talks lead to further negotiations mubarak succeeded 
anwar sadat who took part in the camp david accords 
exactly when such longterm talks on ethiopia would be held and 
who would oversee them are matters the delegations hope to decide in 
atlanta carter has said

the senate today approved 838 legislation 
shifting 45 million used for congressional mailings to a drug 
treatment program aimed at helping drugaddicted mothers and their 
babies 
the lopsided vote came over strong opposition from sen ted 
stevens ralaska who accused its backers of political posturing at 
the expense of lawmaker communications with constituents 
republicans proposed the measure wednesday the day after 
president bush announced a 79billion antidrug abuse campaign 
aimed at transferring the money from the account legislators use for 
their mailings the provision was offered as an amendment to a bill 
providing 2 billion for congress own expenses for fiscal 1990 
which begins oct 1 
the proposal all but eliminates districtwide mailings used often 
by senators and representatives to keep their names in their 
constituents minds but it allows members to continue answering 
individual queries 
critics said the mass mailings provided taxpayerfinanced 
publicity to incumbents making them difficult to defeat 
stevens had said wednesday that such a dramatic cut in 
congressional mailings to constituents would deprive alaskans of an 
important source of news he said many alaskans get no daily 
newspapers and learn of news from washington only from radio and 
brief television broadcasts 
we send out a postal patron newsletter to people who have no 
other source of information about whats going on in the nations 
capital stevens told his colleagues 
but stevens lured few senators to his cause during todays 
debate although sen paul simon dill did say he thought the 
amendment was not in the national interest 
seven democrats and one republican voted against the amendment 
they were bill bradley dnj ernest hollings dsc daniel 
inouye dhawaii joseph lieberman dconn spark matsunaga 
dhawaii daniel patrick moynihan dny and the republican 
stevens 
nine senators did not vote final action on the appropriations 
bill was put off until later in the day 
the measure was proposed by sen pete wilson rcalif a 
supporter of tougher efforts against drug abuse a longtime critic 
of the burgeoning costs of legislators mailings and a candidate for 
governor of california 
what we are faced with is the opportunity to not spend on 
newsletters and instead to put this money into one of the least 
wellfunded drug programs wilson said 
the money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides 
treatment to drugaddicted pregnant women focusing on those who use 
crack wilson said 400000 babies are born annually to mothers who 
use drugs 
in his tuesday evening speech unveiling the 79 billion drug 
campaign bush proposed spending 300 million for treatment 
programs he listed initiatives to help pregnant drug users as part 
of the effort but didnt specifically say how much should be spent 
for them 
without wilsons amendment the legislative spending bill would 
limit congressional spending on mail next year to 80 million 48 
million for the house which has 435 members and 32 million for 
the 100member senate 
the bill would also reduce from six to two the number of 
districtwide mailings permitted each year except for notices of 
town meetings legislators could send more but would have to pay 
for them out of the funds each receives for general office expenses 
congress is on track to spend 539 million on its mail this 
year but those expenses traditionally skyrocket during election 
years which 1990 happens to be 
the house passed a 16 billion version of the legislative 
spending bill july 31 that would provide 1247 million for 
congressional mailings 
house and senate negotiators will have to find a compromise to 
their differences over congressional mail before the bill can be 
sent to bush for his signature

the government has invited sinhalese 
and tamil rebels for peace talks with all political parties in a bid 
to end ethnic wars in which 16000 people have been killed 
officials said thursday 
military officials said the latest violence largely inspired by 
sinhalese radicals of the peoples liberation front had claimed 32 
lives since wednesday 
the sinhalese group is an ultranationalist guerrilla organization 
that has waged a campaign of assassinations and strikes to topple 
president ranasinghe premadasas government 
bradman weerakoon the presidents foreign affairs adviser told 
reporters the government invited the peoples liberation front and 
leaders of sri lankas 23 recognized parties to the proposed peace 
conference sept 13 
we have positive responses from 10 parties we have not 
received a single negative response so for all intents and purposes 
there is a general acceptance of the governments invitation said 
weerakoon 
he said the sinhalese radicals are not among the 10 who have 
accepted but they have not rejected the invitation the group has 
rejected all previous peace overtures 
weerakoon said premadasa also had invited the liberation tigers 
of tamil eelam a dominant separatist group and other former tamil 
militant groups 
most groups of the minority tamils ended their battle for an 
independent nation in the northeast two years ago following an 
accord that promised tamils limited autonomy 
but the tamil tigers reneged on the peace plan and began 
attacking indian peacekeeping soldiers deployed to supervise the 
accord which was signed june 29 1987 at least 1000 soldiers have 
died in the fighting 
at least 10000 other people have been killed in the tamil war 
most of the deaths occurred between 1983 when the tamils took up 
arms and 1987 when the accord was signed 
after tamil agitation subsided sinhalese radicals in the south 
and center of the island began fighting to protest the accord which 
they said gives too many concessions to the minority tamils and an 
indian troop presence they charge compromises sri lankas 
sovereignty 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and say 
they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and control the government most tamils 
are hindu while sinhalese are mainly buddhist 
the government says at least 5000 people have died in the 
sinhalese rebellion and blames the radicals for most deaths the 
radicals say the military and progovernment vigilante groups are 
responsible for the killings 
among the 32 people killed in the latest violence were three 
soldiers blown up in a land mine blast thursday and another shot by 
sinhalese extremists who ambushed troops bathing in a stream the 
military officials said they said they did not know who planted the 
land mine

businesses plan to increase their plant and 
equipment spending by 77 percent this year the government said 
thursday in a report that analysts said shows no sign that industry 
fears an imminent recession 
its yet another indication the economy looks quite healthy 
said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
the commerce department reported that responses to a survey 
completed last month show that businesses expect to spend 46395 
billion on expansion and modernization this year despite earlier 
concern about a significant economic slowdown 
if the plans are realized capital spending this year would break 
last years record the department revised its 1988 spending figure 
to 43074 billion from 42369 reported earlier 
all of the numbers are adjusted for inflation 
economists had worried that the economy approaching its seventh 
year of growth might be stalled by federal reserve efforts to halt 
inflation by restraining credit 
however interest rates began edging down last spring and a 
number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is 
slowing though not as fast as previously thought 
sinai said the survey indicates nothing but a green golight 
for the economy for the rest of the year 
plant and equipment spending is seen as a plus for the economy 
because it indicates continued expansion and eases inflationary 
pressures by increasing productive capacity 
but economist michael p niemira of mitsubishi bank in new york 
said corporate profits have been falling recently and the subsequent 
drain on cash flows is likely to have an effect on next years 
capital spending 
right now is the corporate planning time for next year when i 
think we will see a much reduced pace he said but for this 
year the money has been allocated 
the commerce department surveys have shown a steady increase in 
capital spending plans for this year in its first survey conducted 
last december companies had estimated their spending would rise 59 
percent 
subsequent surveys showed spending plans up 63 percent in march 
and 65 percent in june 
capital spending grew a revised 89 percent in 1988 after a 
revised 42 percent gain in 1987 plant and equipment spending fell 
39 percent in 1986 
manufacturing companies estimated they would increase their 
spending by 61 percent to 17824 billion in the latest survey 
compared to a revised 117 percent advance in 1988 the new figure 
includes a 28 percent gain for plants that produce durable goods 
bigticket items expected to last more than three years and a 91 
percent gain for companies producing nondurable goods 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing ventures said they planned to increase capital 
spending by 87 percent to 28572 billion 
before adjusting for inflation 1989 capital spending is expected 
to rise 10 percent to 47365 billion compared with 105 percent in 
1988

an eightmonth campaign to make honesty the 
best policy in columbus has been extended to january and if crime 
statistics are a measure the extension is needed 
take an honest look headed by jeb stuart magruder watergate 
conspiratorturned presbyterian minister was touted at its kickoff 
in january as the first phase of a bid to raise consciousness and 
discussion about ethics in daily life 
spokeswoman carol mcburney of zimmerman public relations said the 
columbus commission on ethics and values voted wednesday to extend 
it until midjanuary to allow several projects to be completed one 
project is a change in school curriculum to include lessons in 
honesty 
we will have some kind of a wrapup event in january we had to 
set an ending date some people on the commission never want it to 
end she said 
the extension also gives the panel time to determine how and if 
it will be able to gauge the campaigns effectiveness 
magruder said an attempt will be made this fall in conjunction 
with ohio state university to determine public opinion on the isse 
honesty isnt something you can measure he said but you 
can measure whether the message has been heard whether it sank in 
is another question altogether 
but if crime statistics are any indication the commission has 
more work to do overall the rate of felony crimes as of june was 
up from last year said howard wilson city police crime prevention 
coordinator 
for the city of columbus the uniform crime index is up 82 
percent in a comparison of january to june 1988 to the same period 
in 1989 he said 
cases of murder and manslaughter are up 205 percent from last 
year vehicle thefts rose 28 percent and aggravated assaults were up 
116 percent 
however the number of cases of forcible rape dropped by 249 
percent he said 
told about the increase in the crime rate ms mcburney joked 
well i guess wed better not use those figures then 
magruder deputy director of communications in the administration 
of richard nixon and deputy director of nixons committee to 
reelect the president in 1972 went to prison after he admitted 
destroying records and committing perjury in the watergate scandal 
he was ordained a presbyterian minister in 1981 and now serves at 
first community church in suburban marble cliff 
magruder said he is pleased with the dozens of tales he has 
collected demonstrating individual acts of honesty 
we had a woman return five bags of lottery tickets she found 
and someone returned 100 from an automatic teller machine at the 
columbus airport that wasnt his he said and a woman from fort 
wayne ind who stayed in a local hotel to attend a wedding left 
behind an envelope with cash in it she forgot about it until she 
got home and was pleased and delighted to find out from the hotel 
clerk that somebody turned it in 
the privately funded campaign has spread its word via billboards 
public service announcements on radio and television and one public 
forum it also has sent information to schools to encourage teachers 
to include honesty in lesson plans 
the commissions next effort which will begin sometime early in 
the new year will focus on respect and prejudice

gen michel aoun said thursday that us 
foreign policy is biased and shortsighted then asked american 
help in what the christian leader calls the war of liberation 
against syrian troops in lebanon aoun said the us withdrawal of 
its last diplomats wednesday was based on rumors false 
suppositions and unconvincing reasons 
he likened the 6monthold battle between his 20000 christian 
soldiers and a moslem alliance led by the 40000 syrians to what 
americans forefathers did 200 years ago in the 
revolutionary war 
syrians and christians exchanged artillery fire for five hours 
before dawn thursday and police reported two dead and seven wounded 
at least 830 people have been killed and 2462 wounded since the 
artillery war began march 8 nearly all the victims have been 
civilians 
the ustrained general said he would welcome the return of 
ambassador john mccarthy and other american diplomats to lebanon 
only if washington recognized his christian cabinet as the 
legitimate government 
his government competes for power with a moslem cabinet led by 
acting premier salim hoss mccarthy who had been in lebanon since 
the rival regimes were created a year ago avoided taking sides by 
not presenting his credentials to either 
us military helicopters evacuated the 30 remaining americans 
from the us embassy compound in east beirut on wednesday morning 
it is pitiful that americanlebanese relations should 
deteriorate to that point due to the stubbornness of the american 
embassy backed by a biased and shortsighted foreign policy 
aoun said 
he was clearly angered by the state departments declaration 
wednesday that it evacuated the us diplomats because aoun 
threatened to expose them to a good dose of christian terrorism 
speaking to reporters in his bunker under the shattered 
presidential palace in baabda east of beirut the 54yearold 
maronite catholic general urged the american people and their 
elected representatives to ignore their state departments policy 
americans should support all the lebanese moslems and 
christians in our war of liberation against the syrians he said 
syrian soldiers are in lebanon under a peacekeeping mandate the 
arab league issued in 1976 the year after the sectarian civil war 
began at least 150000 lebanese have been killed in the war 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said wednesday 
that a leader of christian youths who massed outside the embassy 
before the evacuation told diplomats they could move in and out of 
the compound only at their own risk 
aoun said her remarks were a calculated but crude personal 
attack on me 
it is an attack perhaps born of desperation rather than 
exasperation at the continued lebanese resistance and based at best 
on half truth hearsay and downright black propaganda at which we 
all know the state department excels he told journalists 
ms tutwiler quoted aoun as saying in an interview with the 
french newspaper figaro that perhaps he should take 20 american 
hostages 
in the interview published sept 1 aoun was asked whether the 
united states was putting pressure on france not to aid him and 
replied in part 
they put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have so 
acted because they have 10 hostages being held in lebanon as if the 
war were being waged without hostages or victims if i understand 
well it would be enough that tomorrow i take 20 americans hostage 
so that the united states stops putting pressure on my friends 
eight americans are among the 16 western captives in lebanon 
after aouns news conference thursday ms tutwiler repeated her 
feeling about the remark to figaro i view it as a threat 
aoun was not asked about it during the news conference 
the general said he had assigned his best officers and 
soldiers to protect the embassy and american diplomats he said 
the decision to evacuate them was unjustified because there 
have never been any victims or any hostagetaking in this region at 
all since the current events started 
his reference was to the 310squaremile enclave north and east 
of beirut in which an estimated 1 million christians live it has 
been sealed off by the syrians and their moslem allies

president bush to be a cheerleader for changes in schools but few 
will seek more federal money when they meet him for an education 
summit the governors leader says 
sure theyd like to see more money in some areas but i think 
realistically they recognize thats not going to happen said iowa 
gov terry branstad a republican who chairs the national governors 
association 
the governors will meet bush on sept 27 and 28 in 
charlottesville va branstad said hes surveyed all 50 to develop a 
list of priorities which include drugs improving support of 
teachers raising literacy rates dealing with atrisk 
youngsters and restructuring schools 
a few governors indicated theyll push for more money for college 
loans for lowincome students but most understand that our best 
hope is to try to get the administration to buy into giving the 
states more flexibility branstad said in an interview this week 
instead the governors will ask bush to bring the visibility and 
muscle of the white house to a yearlong effort to develop a 
national consensus for changes in education branstad said 
hes the most visible person in the united states and if he 
decides to make something an issue its going to be an issue he 
said what we want to do is raise the visibility of education as a 
national agenda item 
branstad said the result could be the nations first coordinated 
response to a nation at risk a report critical of american 
education 
we havent really had a consensus response branstad said 
weve had various experimentation and different things going on 
some which has worked some of which hasnt 
branstad said some education reform efforts have failed because 
elected officials havent worked to gain support 
governors and legislatures passed laws that said we will have 
better education it didnt work because it didnt get down to the 
people in the classrooms he said 
representatives of the governors and white house staffers are 
negotiating over the summits format the meeting will have many 
closeddoor sessions branstad said 
the president is interested in casual candid and fruitful 
discussions between himself and the governors bush aide roger 
porter said in a memo therefore there will be no outside 
speakers and very limited staff

president bush denounced a housepassed defense 
bill as totally unacceptable to the commander in chief on 
thursday and accused the chamber of holding the defense budget 
hostage to 20 billion in unneeded programs 
bush in a speech to the american legion that mixed defense and 
antidrug themes also praised wednesdays decision by colombian 
president virgilio barco to extradite a major drug figure to the 
united states 
the extradition of eduardo martinez romero to face us drug 
moneylaundering charges sends a strong signal of the courage and 
determination of president barco and the colombian government to 
deal with the scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us 
bush said 
declaring remember pearl harbor bush also poked fun at his 
1988 campaign gaffe to the same group one year ago confusing 
pearl harbor day 
today surprisingly is sept 7 can you believe it and im 
determined not to repeat the mistake i made exactly one year ago 
when i referred to this as pearl harbor day 
a year ago bush a world war ii combat veteran told the 
american legion convention in louisville ky i wonder how many 
americans remember that today is pearl harbor day the japanese 
air attack on the us naval base in hawaii occurred dec 7 1941 
the president moving from drugs to defense said americans 
deserve protection from both the fear of war abroad and the fear 
of drugs and crime at home 
but he claimed that the national defense was threatened by the 
house version of a defense spending bill for the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 a housesenate conference committee begins work on a 
compromise version friday 
while suggesting he could live with the senatepassed bill which 
preserves most of the administrations programs bush declared 
the house version is totally unacceptable to the commander in 
chief of the united states armed forces 
congressional negotiators must reconcile rival versions of the 
legislation to authorize 295 billion in pentagon spending and 10 
billion for defense programs in the energy department 
the house refused to fully fund either of the two types of mobile 
intercontinental ballistic missiles bush wants it chopped in half 
to 502 million from 11 billion bushs request for the railbased 
multiplewarhead mx and it deleted all funds for the singlewarhead 
midgetman 
the house bill contains unneeded programs costing nearly 20 
billion from 1990 to 1994 holding our defense budget hostage to 
projects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategic 
modernization bush said 
fellow veterans real peace is not an accident so let us 
modernize our strategic forces and thus encourage arms control 
bush said 
the president a longtime american legion member wore a cap from 
his home post post 77 in houston at the beginning and end of his 
appearance although removing it for the speech 
on drugs bush said his 79 billion antidrug package unveiled 
in a speech to the nation tuesday will require the bravery and 
sacrifice that americans have shown before and must again 
as veterans you know how battles are often fought house by 
house block by block well well win this battle the same way 
were going to win win it kid by kid neighborhood by 
neighborhood he said 
to critics of the plan bush said some incredibly say its 
not enough this from the very people who oppose the death penalty 
its that kind of thinking thats lost too many battles 
so lets not let these critics lose the war he added i 
ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our 
drug strategy 
afterwards bush attended a ceremony at nearby fort mchenry 
marking the 175th anniversary of the war of 1812 battle against the 
british that inspired francis scott key to write the starspangled 
banner 
standing before a 90foot white flagpole bush called the fort 
one of americas most hallowed shrines and said its small force 
of soliders had stopped a british invasion and preserved our 
independence 
while bush used his appearance before the american legion to 
promote his drug plan and criticize the houses defense bill one 
republican lawmaker suggested using money for the pentagons b2 
stealth bomber to fund the antidrug effort 
rep john g rowland of connecticut said he will introduce 
legislation next week to cancel all procurement money authorized by 
the house for the stealth bomber in fiscal 1990 and transfer the 
funds to bushs antidrug program 
the house in approving its version of the defense bill last 
month authorized procurement of two stealth bombers which at a 
cost of 530 million apiece are considered the most expensive planes 
in history

in an explosion at a fuel depot outside baghdad contradicting 
reports by british media and kurdish dissidents that at least 700 
people died and that the site was a topsecret missile plant 
the embassy said 19 firefighters and civil defense workers 
fighting a fire at a depot containing highly flammable gasoline

missiles by developing a technology that is not yet available to 
argentina itself the statement said

a man who fell into an 8footdeep drainage 
culvert lived there for a week without food water or sleep but said 
he never gave up hope he would survive 
i prayed to god you better believe i prayed to god william 
logsdon 56 said in a telephone interview from his hospital room 
but i never thought i would die i knew i would get out i always 
had hope 
logsdon was rescued wednesday after a man collecting aluminum 
cans spotted him he was in stable condition thursday 
logsdon said he had been walking along us 61 in his hometown of 
canton in rural northeastern missouri near the illinois and iowa 
borders on aug 30 or 31 when he moved to the shoulder of the road 
to avoid a passing car and fell into the culvert 
i laid back in there because i didnt have the strength or 
energy to get up he said i was screaming for help but nobody 
heard me so i just sat there 
on wednesday afternoon canton resident bob miller spotted logsdon 
as he roamed the area collecting aluminum cans miller called police 
and an ambulance 
one of the first officers on the scene state trooper ernest 
schroeder it was a miracle he was in such good condition 
i have no doubt in my mind he was there for a week schroeder 
said 
he said logsdon who has limited use of one arm and walks with a 
limp is wellknown in the community and someone saw him the day he 
disappeared carrying yellow bags that were with him when he was 
rescued 
logsdon who suffers epileptic seizures and lives with his 
brother and sisterinlaw also was in the habit of telling his 
family where he was going and when he would return home it wasnt 
clear whether a seizure contributed to his entrapment 
logsdon also missed a dental appointment sept 1 and he would 
never miss a dental appointment schroeder said logsdons 
sisterinlaw filed a missingperson report that day 
authorities had searched extensively for him using helicopters 
and a ground sweep during the week 
dr robert prosser director of emergency services at the 
university of kansas medical center said the weather conditions 
helped logsdon survive 
it was hot and humid and he was probably sheltered by the 
culvert and able to retain some water prosser said certainly 
going without food is not unusual at all

the state department estimated thursday that up 
to 250000 soviet citizens will apply for admission to the united 
states in 1990 
we are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the 
expansion in demand spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
about half the applicants are jews armenians comprise another 
large category as do pentecostal christians 
the spokeswoman denied published reports that because of the 
heavy flow some soviet jews would be declared ineligible this would 
have the effect of diverting many of them to israel 
the united states was instrumental in persuading the soviet union 
to lower is immigration barriers the rising exodus is a mark of 
success ms tutwiler said and we welcome it 
most jews who leave the soviet union have permits to go to 
israel but the vast majority opt for the united states once they 
reach vienna 
a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
us embassy in moscow was receiving 10000 applications a month 
from soviet jews for admission into the united states another 
10000 a month were applying through the dutch embassy for 
emigration to israel he said 
the rate is going straight up he said 
the bush administration is pondering how to handle the situation 
with a decision expected within a week or two 
the administration is definitely not proposing to bar soviet 
jews from emigrating to the united states ms tutwiler said we 
are not propsoing rules to make any soviet jews ineligible 
known to be under consideration is the addition of dozens of us 
workers to the us embassy in moscow to handle the applications 
the state department also is considering a sixmonth waiiting 
period for soviet jews who do not have close relatives in the united 
states 
we are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the 
explosion in demand because of our successful efforts in pressing 
the soviets to open emigration ms tutwiler said 
she estimated that applications will be received from up to 
100000 soviet nationals in the fiscal year that ends sept 30 
in fiscal year 1990 she said we expect that the number of 
soviet applicants could increase to around a quarter of a million

the government accused east germany on 
thursday of trying to disrupt talks on the fate of 6500 east german 
refugees awaiting passage to the west 
west germany launched a diplomatic offensive in bonn east berlin 
and prague but the flurry of highlevel talks failed to break an 
impasse on the refugees 
more than 6000 east germans frustrated with the lack of reform 
under east berlins rigid communist leadership have escaped to west 
germany through hungary in recent weeks 
another 6000 are huddled in hungarian tent cities and nearly 500 
are in bonns missions in eastern europe demanding the right to 
emigrate to west germany 
hungary promised a week ago it would not force any east germans 
to return home west german politicians said the hungarians had 
agreed to allow the refugees to migrate to west germany 
however hungary has since refused to authorize the refugees 
departure calling on east germany and west germany to work out a 
solution 
czechoslovakia has taken the same view the bonn foreign ministry 
indicated in a statement released late thursday 
it said foreign minister hansdietrich genscher had dispatched a 
senior envoy dieter kastrup to meet with czechoslovak foreign 
minister jaromir johanes to discuss the east germans crowding bonns 
embassy there 
johanes said the refugees fate depended on an agreement between 
bonn and east berlin 
chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters met with 
east germanys top diplomat here horst neubauer but a statement 
issued by bonn indicated the talks made little if any headway 
the recent public comments from the east german side can only 
be seen as an attempt to disturb the negotiations and to shift 
responsibility elsewhere for resolving the problem the government 
statement said 
east germanys ambassador to hungary gerd vehres held a press 
conference for hungarian reporters and restated east berlins 
promise that those who return voluntarily will not be punished 
vehres denied east germany demanded the refugees be forcibly 
returned but again characterized west germanys decision to give 
them shelter as interference in domestic affairs 
hungarian government spokesman zsolt bajnok told reporters a 
few days are still required before the east germans can be 
released but he refuse to be more specific 
there also were talks in east berlin on thursday between 
officials of the east german foreign ministry and bonns 
representative to east germany franz bertele west germany does not 
recognize east german sovereignty and therefore does not send an 
ambassador there 
both sides agreed to keep the east berlin talks confidential 
according to the west german government statement seiters told 
neubauer that bonn expressly rejected an accusation by the 
official east german news agency adn claiming bonn had reneged on 
a deal to clear out the 116 refugees from the west german mission in 
east berlin 
seiters reaffirmed that bonn will not force anyone to leave the 
missions protection the statement said 
hungary a warsaw pact member that is seeking closer western 
ties has been caught in the middle of the diplomatic dispute 
because its decision last spring to dismantle border barriers with 
austria unwittingly provided a new escape route for east germans 
while east germans face numerous obstacles to travel west they 
can usually obtain permission to visit neighboring hungary 
the 6000 being cared for in hungary by international aid workers 
were mostly vacationers who decided against returning home after 
word spread that a onetime caravan to west germany would be 
authorized by the hungarian government 
many of those at the west german mission in prague were caught 
trying to cross illegally between czechoslovakia and hungary and 
appealed to the west germans out of fear they would be punished if 
they went back to east germany

the family of joan whitney payson which sold 
vincent van goghs irises two years ago for 539 million hopes 
to fetch a similar price on nov 15 for an early picasso 
selfportrait 
sothebys said thursday that au lapin agile named after a 
tavern frequented by the artist has been consigned by mrs paysons 
daughter linda de roulet who kept the picasso in her home in 
manhasset on long island 
she inherited it from her mother a philanthropist coowner of a 
racing stariod are in museums 
this one appeared briefly in 1980 at the national museum of western 
art in tokyo said david nash senior vice president of fine arts 
for sothebys new york 
picasso then 25 painted the unsigned work in 1905 as a gift to 
frederic gerard the tavern owner who appears in the background 
strumming a guitar maybe picasso gave it in exchange for a few 
drinks who knows said nash 
mrs payson acquired it in 1952 this magnificent painting was 
in our parents home in manhasset for 27 years and for a time hung 
near van goghs irises mrs de roulet said in a statement 
her brother said in an interview that mrs de roulet also 
displayed au lapin agile prominently but she became a bit 
nervous having the painting in her house because of the prices 
commanded by irises and yo picasso a 1901 selfportrait 
sold for 478 million on may 9 
the real clincher said payson was in december when mrs de 
roulet discovered her grandsons playing with a dartboard near the 
picasso 
that seemed to be some kind of an omen said payson 
nash said its difficult to set a presale estimate because of the 
unpredictable art market 
this is much larger than yo picasso it is a much more 
complex painting with considerable psychological tensions he 
said in a logical world it should lead to a higher price 
part of the sale proceeds will be used to establish a foundation 
for medical research and education

the flood of drugs into the united states has dried 
up since colombias latest round of violence began raising the 
price of cocaine and shrinking the size of crack rocks authorities 
said thursday 
but they warn the sudden drop in trafficking may be temporary 
and could simply be the work of middlemen trying to drive up the 
price 
the miamibased seventh coast guard district which has accounted 
for 97 percent of the more than 10000 pounds of cocaine intercepted 
by the entire service this year has seen import activity suddenly 
grind to a halt said lt cmdr jeff karonis 
were still carrying out the same operations as we were but 
the boats arent coming out and the air drops arent happening 
the targets just arent there 
pat obrien outgoing head of the us customs service in miami 
said agents from his district by far the busiest in the nation had 
been tracking three to five air drops a week prior to the colombian 
crackdown 
that has now come to a standstill he said there was only 
one right after the violence started and we werent even able to 
confirm that 
the only recent major cocaine haul 800 pounds on a freighter in 
tampa on saturday had been loaded and shipped before the violence 
began 
undercover agents trying to make cocaine buys have been put off 
for two to three weeks and even though that period is about up 
there are still no shipments ready he said the summer months have 
traditionally been the traffickers busiest 
in addition moneylaundering activity tracked by customs is 
sputtering traffickers are still moving wire transfers for old 
cocaine shipments but there are few new payments 
the drug enforcement administration has also spotted the change 
but agents there arent sure if it marks a true disruption 
yes there appears to be a slowdown of drug activity out of 
south america a fluctuation in distribution and a rise in the 
wholesale price of cocaine said miami dea spokesman john 
fernandes but we dont know if thats because of whats happening 
in colombia or if entrepreneurs are trying to take advantage of 
whats happening to raise the price 
fernandes said the price of large cocaine shipments in the last 
two weeks has increased from 1100015000 a kilogram to 
1800019000 with individual kilogram sales reaching as high as 
23000 
the scarcity is being felt on the street as well says metrodade 
police cmdr steve rothlein head of the county narcotics bureau 
street prices for a kilogram of cocaine have shot up about 7000 
he said 
crack on the other hand continues to sell for 10 dollar a 
rock but some of the rocks are getting smaller said rothlein 
obrien attributes the disruption in part to the confiscation of 
planes used to carry cocaine from processing plants in southern 
colombia to coastal staging areas 
the heads of the cartels are also having difficulties trying to 
control their operations while on the run he said but how long the 
situation lasts depends on whether the colombian government can keep 
up the pressure 
fernandes warns that the cocaine business is cyclical just like 
any other commodity operation 
there have been slowdowns before he said slowdowns at 
different intervals are normal for the narcoticstrafficking 
business 
he said other traffickers wait in the wings to replace anyone 
arrested or extradited and planes and boats can be bought again 
quickly when the pressure is off

whether to merge the the kansas city star with the kansas city 
times the study began several weeks ago

have been unsettling to our employees readers and advertisers the 
time has come to provide a definitive answer 
the star publishes weekday afternoons and sunday morning the 
times publishes monday through saturday morning 
the star reported thursday that some employees speculated after 
the letter was posted that the study would concern itself with ways 
to accomplish a merger rather than to determine the viability of the 
star hale said that speculation was false 
hale who became publisher in 1977 shortly after the company was 
acquired by capital cities communications inc said one of the 
first questions he was asked was how long capital cities would 
continue to publish the afternoon newspaper he said thursday that 
he did not have the answer then and does not have the answer now 
the study will determine that he said 
i always said i didnt want to be here when that happened 
hale said nobody wants to preside over the death of a great 
newspaper especially me 
according to the 1989 edition of the editor amp publisher yearbook 
the times has a daily circulation of 281886 the stars circulation 
was listed at 184882 daily and 408916 on sundays

a national newspaper said thursday that 
a ninenation spy swap is being negotiated by the east german lawyer 
who arranged the 1986 release of soviet dissident natan sharansky 
the bonnbased daily die welt gave no source for its information 
but said lawyer wolfgang vogel was on a secret mission to israel 
over the weekend to work out the deal 
die welt said the mass release of convicted spies would likely 
free two agents from israel convicted of spying for the kgb as well 
as prisoners in the soviet union the united states east germany 
britain south africa norway iraq and west germany 
west german government sources refused comment on the newspaper 
report which said the spy swap was planned some time in the fall 
in washington the state department also refused comment 
israel and norway denied the report 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said from time to time 
there are articles like this it is certain that we are interested 
in exchanges of prisoners and hostages but we have no information 
on what was printed no one has spoken to us on this and israel was 
not involved in this story 
arne strand a spokesman for norwegian prime minister gro harlem 
brundtland said the government is completely unaware of any such 
spy swap die welt said vogel refused to discuss the reported deal 
when asked by the newspaper for details 
the 63yearold east berlin lawyer has arranged other spy swaps 
in the past including the 1986 exchange that allowed sharansky to 
emigrate to israel 
the newspaper said shabtai kalmanovich sentenced to nine years 
in an israeli prison for his conviction of spying for the soviet 
kgb was one of the prisoners being considered for release it also 
named a professor glinberg without giving his first name who die 
welt said was an expert on chemical warfare the man referred to is 
believed to be marcus klingberg sentenced in 1983 to 18 years 
imprisonment in israel for spying for the soviets 
die welt said the soviets were also seeking the release of dieter 
and ruth gerhardt from south africa dieter gerhardt a former 
admiral is serving a life sentence while his swissborn wife is 
serving a 10year term they were arrested in 1981 the paper said 
norway is involved through the case of former government official 
arne treholt who was convicted of spying for the soviet union and 
iraq and sentenced to 20 years in jail the newspaper said he was 
arrested in 1984 
but treholts lawyer arne haugestad ridiculed the report 
this is nothing but a cockandbull story ntb state news agency 
quoted haugestad as saying 
east germanys secret service was hoping to win the release of 
reinhard and sonja schulze a couple arrested in britain according

hispanic immigrants register to vote at a 
significantly higher rate than most americans and are almost up 
for grabs by both republicans and democrats because many have not 
decided which party they favor a latino group said in announcing 
results of a survey thursday 
the telephone survey of 1635 immigrants from 17 nations showed 
that 81 percent of the naturalized immigrants are registered to 
vote compared with 70 percent of the general us voting age 
population the national association of latino elected and appointed 
officials said 
fortynine percent of those interviewed all of whom were either 
naturalized citizens or legal permanent residents of the united 
states said they had no preference between the major us 
political parties 
this is a large population that is almost up for grabs said 
rep edward roybal dcalif president of the associations 
educational fund which conducted the survey 
republicans and democrats have an open field to go out into the 
latin community and convince them that their party and platform is 
the best said roybal a hispanic from a los angeles district with 
the heaviest concentration of hispanics in his state 
he said the southwest and california in particular will have 
a vast reservoir of people who havent made their minds up yet but 
they do register 
despite the myths of the past they will be registering in high 
numbers and will be getting out to the polls in high numbers 
roybal said 
the study gave no overall figure on the number of hispanic 
immigrants in the united states but said more than oneandahalf 
million have legally entered the country in the past decade and they 
will soon be the largest ethnic minority in the country 
a study in april by the center for political studies at the 
university of michigan showed that among hispanic citizens who had 
made a choice 63 percent of cubans considered themselves 
republicans 9 percent democrats 13 percent independents and 16 
percent no preference 
the corresponding figures for mexican immigrants were 42 percent 
democrat 16 percent republican 10 percent independent and 33 
percent no preference for immigrants from other latin american 
countries the figures were 34 percent democrat 28 percent 
republican 10 percent independent and 27 percent no preference 
the numbers dont add up to exactly 100 percent because of 
rounding 
twentyseven per cent said they had attended political 
fundraisers or contributed money 9 percent had written letters on 
political issues and an equal percentage had taken part in 
canvassing or marching five percent said they had distributed 
political literature and 4 percent said they had helped people 
register or vote 
roybal said he believed the survey indicates that more hispanics 
will be elected to office in years to come perhaps after the year 
2000 
he said political participation by hispanics would give them 
leverage to help prevent state legislatures from drawing 
congressional district lines after the 1990 census that are 
gerrymandered to keep them out 
results of the survey are particularly important because this 
is a group that many believe will not be fully counted in the next 
census roybal said 
the survey also showed that 95 percent of those responding said 
an important reason for wanting to become a us citizen is that it 
allows you to vote 
the survey was conducted in california texas florida new york 
new jersey illinois arizona and maryland nearly half of those 
interviewed were from mexico and onefourth from cuba the principal 
other countries of origin included the dominican republic colombia 
el salvador and ecuador 
the association claims a membership of more than 3300 hispanic 
elected officials appointed officials and community and business 
leaders it did not give a margin of error for its survey

a top iraqi official said thursday his 
country is ready for a comprehensive unconditional exchange of 
prisonersofwar with iran 
a former iranian official still close to the government declared 
there has never been a better time for reaching a full peace 
settlement with iraq 
speaking at the summit of the nonaligned movement in belgrade 
yugoslavia iraqi deputy premier taha yassin ramadan said his 
country was prepared for a full exchange of all pows with iran 
regardless of the lack of progress on other issues in the peace 
talks 
his remarks were carried by the iraqi news agency monitored in 
nicosia 
talks on implementing un resolution 598 which halted the war 
aug 20 1988 began five days after the ceasefire but the talks 
stalled almost immediately and have been deadlocked since the last 
round of talks held in geneva in april broke down in an 
acrimonious stalemate 
the deadlocked peace talks have left an estimated 100000 men 
held by both sides languishing in pow camps 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia quoted 
mohammad javad larijani a former deputy foreign minister close to 
newly elected president hashemi rafsanjani as writing that there 
has never been such a good chance of attaining peace as there is 
now one should appreciate such chances 
larijani whose remarks quoted by irna were carried in the daily 
ettelaat said that was partly because the iraqis were desperate to 
rebuild their warshattered economy 
no new peace talks between iran and iraq are scheduled 
the iraqis insist on direct talks with the iranians without un 
mediation but iran has refused 
after the last round of talks broke down the iraqis proposed 
exchanging pows the iranians refused insisting that the full un 
peace resolution must be implemented step by step 
the resolution calls for withdrawal of troops to internationally 
recognized boundaries the exchange of pows and dredging of the 
shattalarab waterway which is shared by both sides according to a 
1975 agreement but which is cluttered with war debris 
the talks have been stalled over irans insistence that iraqi 
troops withdraw from some 385 square miles of its territory before 
the talks can continue 
but the iraqis reject the 1975 algiers treaty which drew the 
border in the middle of the shattalarab they insist that the 
border must be redrawn along the iranian bank of the shatt to 
include all of the waterway in iraqi territory

hundreds of bats descended on downtown 
in daylight many dying on streets and sidewalks and officials are 
not sure why 
i have never seen bats on the sidewalk at 4 oclock in the 
afternoon before said chris farkas who estimated there were 50 
to 100 bats on the ground outside his restaurant just before the 
wednesday evening rush hour 
jeff derosa of the humane society of north texas found 100 more 
bats on a sidewalk nearby and said at least 1000 were hanging from 
the eaves of a building 
another humane society official lynn buffington said thursday 
that no one was sure whether the bats had been poisoned or suffered 
heat stroke the temperature reached 96 degrees wednesday afternoon 
my concern was that we got this call at 415 yesterday and most 
of the employees in these downtown buildings would be coming out and 
there would be these tiny little things on the ground ms 
buffington said i was concerned about a health problem 
bats become disoriented in daylight but if they are not too sick 
they probably could regroup after nightfall said dudley brown 
assistant director of the fort worth zoo 
the humane society had received no reports of bats downtown

when the nation embraced its illfated reforms of 1968 has for the 
first time signed a document criticizing the government a human 
rights organization said thursday

to slovaks to lay flowers at public monuments on aug 21 in memory

attackers fired several rockets thursday from 
jordan into israel and a news report said a plo faction claimed 
responsibility the government demanded that jordan do a better job 
of policing its border 
there were no casualties in the attacks but israelis living 
along the border expressed concern that the generally quiet boundary 
might be changing into a line of confrontation 
jordanian officials said at least one rocket fell on their side 
of the border and that they were checking the source of the firing 
israel radio reported that a syrianbacked marxist faction of the 
plo the popular front for the liberation of palestine claimed 
responsibility for the attack in a statement released to radio monte 
carlo 
we still do not think that jordans policy of ensuring the 
security and quiet of the border between us has changed prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said on israeli televisions arabic language 
service but all the incidents that have occured lately require 
caution and alertness 
when asked what jordan should do following the raid shamir said 
first of all they must prevent this this is their 
responsibility 
foreign minister moshe arens echoed shamirs comments in an 
interview on israel television 
it is certain that the jordanian government is responsible for 
every terrorist act whose source is jordanian territory arens 
said we are asking the government of jordan to take action to 
prevent such acts in the future 
shamir said the attack could be the result of recent jordanian 
moves at a rapprochement with the plo 
it could be that as a result of some improvement in ties 
between the government of jordan and the plo the plo men were given 
more freedom to act in jordan and this attack could be the 
result shamir said 
the rocket attack was the second incident in a week and the fifth 
this year across a normally quiet border 
the other attack was saturday when an infiltrator shot and killed 
one israeli soldier and fatally wounded another 
israeli newspapers have reported that the army asked farmers who 
live along the border to carry weapons when they go to their fields 
menachem regev secretary of a collective farm near where the 
rockets fell said on army radio there was concern about the growing 
number of incidents which were the most frequent since a four year 
war of attrition that started in 1969 
its like were returning to the situation of 20 years ago 
regev said 
jordan does not permit cross border attacks and expelled 
palestinian guerrillas in a 197071 civil war sharply reducing such 
attempts 
but some radical syrianbased palestinian groups have 
occassionally tried to use jordan as a launching pad for raids

the government said thursday that a 
visit by romanias defense minister has been canceled an apparent 
result of the deteriorating relations between the warsaw pact allies 
ilie ceausescu romanian deputy minister of national defense 
is not to visit hungary in spite of preliminary plans the 
official mti news agency quoted hungarian defense minister col gen 
ferenc karpati as saying 
ceausescu is the brother of romanian leader nicolae ceausescu 
mti did not say which nation canceled the visit a date for it 
was never announced hungarian officials had been criticized for 
weeks over the planned visit 
reporting on the cancellation the government daily magyar hirlap 
said karpati told reporters that hungarian youth is opposed to the 
visit of the romanian general 
the warsaw pact countries are seriously split over the plight of 
17 million ethnic hungarians in romania 
romania claims no wrongdoing but hungary says romanian citizens 
face discrimination and has given 18000 of them asylum during the 
past two years the actions flout an agreement obliging hungary to 
return romanian citizens fleeing over the countries border 
the two nations also have disputed control of transylvania which 
is under control of romania 
the bitterness between the soviet bloc countries also stems from 
changing politics 
under ceausescus undisputed oneman leadership romanias 
communist party prohibits dissent hungary meanwhile has moved 
toward reform and next year plans to hold the nations first free 
elections since the communists consolidated power more than 40 years 
ago 
ilie ceausescus planned visit first was announced in the july 14 
issue of nephadsereg hungarys military weekly 
hungarys fledgling political opposition parties and some senior 
communist officials immediatey criticized the plan 
central committee member matyas szueros the speaker of 
parliament said he found it incomprehensible he accused the 
romanian leadership of an official political campaign to 
persecute the hungarian minority and said bilateral relationships 
had hit bottom 
he also called ceausescus leadership an example of degenerate 
socialism and called for transylvanian autonomy 
tensions even have caused senior hungarian officials to express 
concern about romanias defense policies 
foreign minister gyula horn told reporters in july it would be 
irresponsible to ignore signals from romania referring to 
claims by bucharest that it was capable of manufacturing nuclear 
weapons and was thinking of acquiring midrange missiles

the reputed financial wizard of the medellin 
cocaine cartel arrived under guard at a tiny outofway airport 
before sunrise thursday the first of colombias extraditables 
brought to the united states for trial 
the extradition of eduardo martinez romero an alleged 
moneylaunderer for the drug cartel that is believed to supply 80 
percent of americas cocaine came days after president bush 
declared war on latin americas cocaine barons 
martinez 36 was put on a drug enforcement administration plane 
in bogota on wednesday night he arrived at 4 am outside atlanta 
at charlie brown airport an airfield used mostly by private planes 
and was whisked to court by helicopter 
hours later after the government obtained an interpreter for 
him he appeared before us magistrate joel m feldman and told him 
he speaks only spanish and does not fully comprehend the 
moneylaundering charges against him 
feldman postponed arraignment until monday and ordered martinez 
held without bail at an undisclosed site defense attorney ed 
garland said even he had not been told where martinez was being held 
assistant us attorney wilmer parker iii said he will ask that 
bail be denied 
security at the courthouse was unremarkable despite the wave of 
bombings associated with colombias crackdown on drugs which 
resulted in martinezs arrest aug 20 martinez was not handcuffed 
or shackled in court 
the medellin cartels reputed money man is on the united states 
list of socalled extraditables colombias most important drug 
kingpins 
martinez who told the judge he holds a postgraduate degree is 
marketing is accused of laundering up to 27 million in drug 
profits by funneling the cash through us banks including one in 
atlanta 
he is the first person extradited to the united states since 
colombias crackdown began last month 
martinez has previously denied any links to the medellin cartel 
which the government claims is the largest cocaine operation in the 
world 
based on what i heard today i would anticipate he will enter a 
plea of not guilty said garland the atlanta lawyer said he was 
contacted by a member of martinezs family 
martinez was indicted in march in atlanta as a result of an 
investigation codenamed operation polar cap which officials said 
revealed an operation that laundered billions in cocaine profits 
charges were brought against 127 people and two latin american banks 
in march us authorities enlisted the aid of gen manuel 
noriegas military to help arrest martinez while he was inside a 
bank panama city but martinez slipped through the dragnet 
according to the dea 
he was arrested in colombia the first weekend after colombian 
president virgilio barco launched a drug crackdown prompted by the 
aug 18 assassination of a presidential candidate and outspoken foe 
of the drug trade 
included in the emergency measures imposed by barco was a 
reinstitution of the extradition agreement with the united states 
that had been thrown out by the colombian supreme court in 1987 
in response to the crackdown the cocaine barons declared total 
war on the government and have carried out bombings and shootings 
in medellin home of the drug cartel and in bogota the capital 
weldon kennedy the agent in charge of the atlanta fbi office 
said federal agents were on an increased state of alert against 
any retaliation federal officials would provide no details on the 
alert 
were very concerned because of the events transpiring and 
because of the violence that has occurred in colombia kennedy 
said 
he said some cartel members reportedly have said there might be 
some violent act attempted in the united states because of the 
extradition 
the last trafficker to be extradited to the united states was 
carlos lehder a leader of the medellin cartel who was sent to the 
united states in early 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the 
federal prison in marion ill 
garland told reporters after the hearing that president bushs 
speech tuesday outlining a battle plan for a war on drugs may whip 
public opinion into such a frenzy that martinez cannot get a fair 
trial 
the speech probably expressed accurately the feeling of the 
american people said garland my concern is that in our 
frustration over the drug problem we will ignore our other 
freedoms he like anyone else in our country should be presumed 
innocent

address and we believe it is time for the fmln rebels to realize 
that democracy and violence do not mix she said 
she added that fmln support for opening a dialogue is a tribute 
to the resolve congress has shown in reaffirming continued us aid 
to el salvador and for observance of human rights standards 
in doing so it has signaled to the fmln that it will be unable 
to gain power in el salvador by winning a political battle in the

more than 10000 measles cases were reported in 
the united states in the first eight months of this year three 
times the number reported all last year 
the national centers for disease control blamed the 1989 
increase which follows two years of declines on the failure to 
vaccinate young children and ineffective vaccinations 
the cdc said thursday that 10115 cases of the oncewidespread 
childhood disease had been reported through last week 
thats nearly five times the 2170 cases reported at the same 
time last year and also is well above the 3411 reported for the 
entire year in 1988 
this year has seen a large number of outbreaks most of them in 
the nations high schools and colleges the atlantabased cdc said 
so far this year more than 90 measles outbreaks have been 
reported including one large outbreak among unvaccinated 
preschoolers in houston which struck more than 1700 
the unvaccinated young children particularly in outbreakprone 
inner cities are one of two major impediments to wiping out measles 
in the united states the cdc said in its weekly report the other 
is the failure of vaccinations to protect some people which has 
allowed outbreaks in highly vaccinated school populations 
the cdc earlier this year recommended a second dose of measles 
vaccine for children beginning kindergarten or first grade 
everyone born since 1957 when measles was so widespread that 
americans had some natural immunity is considered a potential 
measles risk 
it would be an expensive exhaustive undertaking to revaccinate 
everybody born since 1957 but revaccinating children upon school 
entry should start chipping away at the problem said dr steve 
wassilak a cdc immunization specialist 
the cdc also has recommended earlier vaccinations for innercity 
children as early as 9 months rather than the standard 15 months 
to try to prevent large outbreaks and revaccinations for certain 
children in the case of school measles outbreaks 
specifically the cdc recommended outbreak revaccinations for 
students who were vaccinated before 1980 or vaccinated between the 
ages of 1214 months in both cases the agency said studies have 
shown diminished vaccine effectiveness 
the twodose schedule and intensive efforts to raise 
immunization levels should facilitate the goal of measles 
elimination in the united states the cdc said 
but wassilak cautioned that measles rises and falls in cycles to 
some degree and even if next year is low thats not 
inconsistent theres not going to be an immediate effect its 
going to take a while for the new policy to deter a significant 
number of measles cases 
federal health officials believed measles eradication was within 
reach early in this decade when only a few remaining clusters of 
the disease remained however measles reporting then increased 
between 1983 and 1986 
the 1989 total is already the highest since 1980 when 13430 
cases were reported in the united states the disease fell to a 
record low of 1497 cases in 1983 but increased in 1984 85 and 
86 before beginning another decline from 6282 cases in 1986 to 
3652 in 1987 to the 3411 in 1988 
all this however pales in comparison to the prevaccine levels 
more than half a million cases a year were routinely reported in the 
1950s a measles vaccine became available in the early 1960s

representatives of the ethiopian government and an 
eritrean rebel group shook hands and began preliminary talks 
thursday aimed ending their 28yearold war 
former president jimmy carter is acting as a neutral observer for 
the private talks at the carter center the talks are expected to 
last three days though no time limit has been set the goal carter 
said is to pave the way for more substantive negotiations later 
ethiopia and the rebels are warring over the independence of 
eritrea a province that holds ethiopias only direct access to the 
red sea an estimated 1 million people have died in the conflict and 
its related famine 
officials of the two delegations said thursday they are eager for 
peace but made it clear that profound differences exist 
the eritrean case cannot be resolved by running away from the 
truth or by playing some tricks said alamin mohamed saiyed head 
of the eritrean delegation 
the search for peace should not be viewed as a subterfuge 
to buy time or still worse as part of military maneuvers and 
tactics of war said alamin a member of the politburo of the 
eritrean peoples liberation front 
ashegre yigletu head of the government delegation said ethiopia 
has tried repeatedly during the past 15 years to end the conflict 
peacefully 
it is our view that these peace talks should start off in an 
atmosphere that avoids polemics and recrimination and constructively 
lead to the restoration of peace in the northern part of our 
country said ashegre head of the government central committees 
foreign relations department 
meeting with reporters alamin and ashegre each sat stonefaced 
as the other delivered his opening statement in arabic followed by 
an english interpretation but prodded by carter they rose at the 
end of the meeting and shook hands 
no public statement on the talks will be issued until they end 
as both sides agreed that issuing progress reports would be 
counterproductive carter said 
with the success and building of confidence here in atlanta 
the possibility of a ceasefire and unimpeded delivery of relief 
supplies would be facilitated he said 
the atlanta journalconstitution on thursday quoted unidentified 
diplomats as saying egyptian president hosni mubarak would mediate 
further talks if the preliminary sessions succeed 
a un agreement federated eritrea a former italian colony with 
ethiopia in 1952 rebel groups began forming in the early 1960s when 
they did not get selfrule and ethiopia unilaterally annexed the 
area 
ethiopia considers the conflict a war of secession 
the atlanta talks are under the auspices of an informal group 
called the international negotiating network which includes 
scholars and former diplomats and operates out of the carter center 
the meeting is the networks first effort 
carter is acting as a private citizen in the talks though the 
bush administration has wished him well and carter has said he will 
keep the administration informed 
as president carter withdrew us assistance to ethiopia but 
bush has indicated a desire to thaw the relationship between the two 
nations

with the hope of luring talented young 
professionals into public service a house panel approved a bill 
thursday to allow federal agencies to repay outstanding student 
loans of some employees 
on a voice vote a subcommittee sent to the full post office and 
civil service committee the legislation which authorizes a federal 
agency to repay up to 6000 of an employees federal student loan 
debt in any calender year the measure also would give agencies the 
flexibility to pay or reimburse employees for degree training in 
certain occupations 
the subcommittee on civil service also passed on a voice vote a 
bill to prevent the department of housing and urban development and 
other agencies from stacking performance review boards with 
political appointees it merely clarifies sections of the civil 
service reform act by requiring agencies to have a majority of 
career appointees on review boards when making performance award 
recommendations 
the subcommittee chairman rep gerry sikorski dminn said 
huds present policy not only circumvents the spirit of the civil 
service reform act but also undermines the very goal of a 
performance award system 
instead of instituting a system which motivates and awards 
individuals for successful performance huds policy threatens to 
politicize and void the award process he said 
the full committee chairman rep william d ford dmich 
introduced the student loan bill 
subcommittee members passed the measure with little fanfare or 
discussion because sikorski offered an amendment that addressed most 
of the problems raised by the administration during a july hearing 
under the amended bill an agency may repay a total of 40000 of 
an employees student loan indebtedness employees cannot be 
reimbursed for any loan payments made before the job began and must 
agree in writing before receiving the benefit to remain at the 
agency for a specified period not less than three years 
in selecting workers for the program an agency is required in 
the bill to follow merit principles taking into consideration the 
need to maintain a balanced workforce representative of the racial 
femaletomale ratio and ethnic makeup of our society

lawmakers representing nine states demanded 
thursday that the entire country share the cost of cleaning up their 
states acid rain emissions but colleagues said states that foul 
the air should foot the bill 
the country owes some help to those asked to do more said 
rep philip sharp dind who is chairman of the house energy and 
commerce energy and power subcommittee and represents one of the 
coalproducing states that contribute to acid rain 
we are talking about economic justice for the country sharp 
said at a hearing of the subcommittee 
the regional conflict which has been festering for years 
erupted anew with added urgency because president bush and lawmakers 
from both parties are pushing for a new clean air bill the question 
of who pays to clean up acid rain that is fouling lakes and killing 
trees would have to be resolved before such a bill is passed 
lawmakers from the nine states say their electric utilities 
produce 50 percent of the nations acid rain pollution but would 
have to finance some 67 percent of the cleanup under bushs plan and 
other bills the extra cost would likely be passed on to consumer 
and business electric bills in those states 
that idea is vigorously opposed by miners who produce highsulfur 
coal that is burned exensively in the nine states ohio 
pennsylvania indiana west virginia illinois kentucky missouri 
tennessee and georgia 
united mine workers of america president richard l trumka told 
the hearing up to 30000 miners could be thrown out of work by the 
year 2000 unless other regions share the costs utilities would 
simply adopt the cheapest solution he said and switch to other 
fuels rather than installing expensive pollutionreducing equipment 
sharp said it galls us that the nine states would pay more 
than our fair share 
but rep carlos j moorhead rcalif said other states have 
already paid to clean up their air the other 41 states have 
cleaned up their act and customers are financing antipollution 
efforts with higher utility bills the nine states have the 
cheapest rates he said 
california has had to do away with all our coalfired plants 
and adopted technology that includes expensive solar energy and wind 
machines he said asking why the 41 states should pay for states 
that have not cleaned up their act 
rep michael bilirakis rfla argued that states such as 
florida went to the expense they went to the trouble now youre 
saying we should bear part of the cost 
the bush plan calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by five 
million tons by 1995 and by 10 million tons by 2000 
the cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107 
utilities burning highsulfur coal in 20 states but after 1995 
utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade credits 
with other utilities and with other industries 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which has its own reduction 
schedule are the main components that form an acid in the 
atmosphere and destroy trees and lakes thousands of miles from the 
emissions refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutants 
also although certain coalburning utilities are the main culprits

agriculture officials plan to begin 
an air attack on the mediterranean fruit fly friday night seven 
years after similar sprayings in the area wiped out an invasion of 
the voracious insects 
only 16 medflies have been found so far but those were enough 
for federal and state officials thursday to seek a quarantine of 
fruit from a 60squaremile area in santa clara county southeast of 
san francisco the quarantine from san jose to palo alto is 
voluntary until the filing becomes official next week 
gov george deukmejian declared a state of emergency wednesday 
letting authorities spray the pesticide malathion without issuing an 
environmental impact report that could take months to prepare 
at 9 pm friday if the weather is good two helicopters are 
scheduled to begin five hours of aerial spraying in a 2 million 
battle against a bug that is capable of causing up to 50 million 
damage locally to tomatoes apples pears grapes and other produce 
millions of sterile medflies will be released in 10 days in a 
further attempt to stop the spread of the pests 
in 198082 the state sprayed 1400 square miles in eight 
counties to wipe out a medfly infestation that war cost 100 
million to fight and cost california growers another 100 million in 
lost sales 
medflies started showing up in traps monday and state officials 
wednesday completed a ground spraying of malathion on a 
200squareyard area around a peach tree where the larvae were 
breeding 
agriculture officials who are checking 1700 traps in an 
81squaremile area warned residents to cover their cars and remain 
indoors during the aerial spraying on trees and lawns 
the quarantine the officials said is necessary to prevent 
widespread infestation 
it has to be emphasized that the reason the quarantine kept 
expanding last time is people kept ignoring our warnings about 
moving fruit out of that zone said greg van wassenhove the 
county agricultural commissioner 
statewide agriculture is a 16 billion per year industry last 
year santa clara countys agricultural production was worth 1425 
million with 943 million of the total in fruits nuts vegetables 
and nursery crops that are among the 250 crops that the medfly 
devours 
gera curry spokeswoman for the state department of food and 
agriculture said harvesters truckers processors and sales people 
also would be hurt by a medfly infestation because every 1 in 
agricultural sales produces 3 in the general economy

the house ways and means committee on thursday 
approved its own version of a bill to help lowincome parents with 
their child care costs providing the bulk of the aid by raising 
existing tax credits and entitlements 
on a voice vote the taxwriting panel rejected a competing 
version by the house labor and education committee that would 
establish a new program of direct child care subsidies to middleas 
well as lowincome families 
with the legislation a key priority for members of both parties 
the chief democratic sponsors of the competing versions said they 
hoped to reach a compromise and avoid a politically damaging fight 
on the house floor 
were not that far apart we want to avoid democrats fighting 
democrats said rep thomas j downey dny chief author of the 
ways and means version that because of its reliance primarily on 
tax credits is more agreeable to republicans and the bush 
administration 
with the senate having approved a shotgun marriage of the two 
approaches in june house speaker thomas s foley dwash has said 
he hopes to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote before the 
end of september 
the ways and means panels voice vote thursday was a virtual 
repeat of the same stand in took in july however the committee 
amended its proposal to begin raising the existing child care 
subsidies that the federal government finances through block 
entitlement grants to states by 200 million in 1990 rather than in 
1991 
those entitlements meaning the money does not have to be 
appropriated for them every year are designated for a wide variety 
of programs to aid the poor and are now capped at 27 billion a 
year 
no one knows exactly how much of that existing entitlement money 
is actually spent on subsidizing child care but estimates range 
from 400 million up to slightly over 1 billion 
whatever the total is the legislation envisions increasing the 
amount devoted to child care by 400 million a year by 1994 
all versions of the legislation envision increasing direct 
federal child care subsidies by a total of 175 billion over the 
next five years included in the total are increases in the existing 
head start program for poor children ages 3 to 5 and socalled 
latchkey subsidies for keeping elementary schools open as care 
facilities after classes have ended for the day 
indirect aid through an increase in the earned income tax credit 
for lowincome families would total some 11 billion under the 
senate bill and 135 billion in the house ways and means version 
that credit which is indexed to inflation now totals a maximum 
of 910 a year for a family with an income of between 6500 and 
10240 for every dollar of income above the 10240 the credit is 
reduced by a dime reducing it to zero for a family with an income 
of 19340 the income threshholds for elibility also are raised 
every year by the rate of consumer price inflation 
in 1991 the first year that the new child care tax credit would 
take effect the maximum instead of the projected 1002 would 
rise to 1217 for families with one child under the house ways and 
means version it would rise to a maximum 1504 a year for families 
with two children and 1790 with families of three or more children

most americans think employers should provide 
health insurance for their workers and more than half favor 
national health insurance according to a survey released thursday 
but the survey conducted for the employee benefit research 
institute also suggests that americans undervalue their insurance 
benefits the institute said 
the survey found that 80 percent of those polled believe 
employers should be required to provide health insurance to their 
fulltime workers 
fiftyfour percent said the federal government should insure all 
americans according to the survey 
however few would be willing to bear the full cost of benefits 
about half of those without health insurance said they would be 
willing to pay less than 600 annually for coverage while those 
favoring national health insurance said they would be willing to 
pay on average 664 per year for that coverage 
the average cost of individual coverage is 1056 and for a 
family 2700 according to the institute 
everybody is desperately searching for a silver spoon said 
dallas salisbury president of the private nonprofit nonpartisan 
public policy research organization 
salisbury said the survey results show that most americans dont 
know what health insurance costs and that most workers who are 
insured through their employer do not consider these benefits to be 
part of their compensation 
seven out of eight of those surveyed opposed taxing health 
insurance benefits received from employers but of the bulk who 
favored requiring employers to provide health insurance 73 percent 
said they would still back that requirement even if benefits were 
taxed 
the survey also asked whether respondents would rather have cash 
that would be taxed or the equivalent amount in health insurance 
benefits that would be taxed when the amount was 1000 53 percent 
opted for health insurance benefits and 40 percent for cash when 
the amount was 2000 49 percent took health insurance and 44 
percent went for cash 
of the 1000 adults surveyed by telephone during the last week in 
june nine out of 10 said they had health insurance of the 10 
percent who did not more than onethird said it was because they 
couldnt afford it 14 percent said they were between jobs and 10 
percent said they saw no need for it 
the survey was conducted by the gallup organization inc the 
margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points

the federal superfund program has 
been superslow in cleaning toxic waste dumps and in making 
polluters pay for the work according to a study 
in the programs first eight years ending last september the 
environmental protection agency finished cleaning only 34 dumps out 
of 1175 on a priority list according to the rand corp study to 
be released friday the list represents only the worst of 30000 
dumps where waste ultimately may need to be treated or removed 
the report also found that epa spent only 26 billion of the 
45 billion in superfund money from congress during 19801988 and 
only 16 billion went directly to cleanup work with the rest spent 
on management and legal costs 
finally the agency recovered only 230 million of the 26 
billion from polluters who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work 
said the study by jan paul acton of rands institute for civil 
justice 
superfund has been superslow at cleaning up toxic waste sites 
spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who 
did the polluting the nonprofit santa monicabased think tank 
said in a statement summarizing actons findings 
other studies have criticized superfunds pace but rands is a 
very good attempt to statistically measure progress in cleaning 
dump sites said walter kovalick jr the epas deputy director of 
superfund 
after he was appointed by president bush epa administrator 
william reilly ordered an internal review that criticized superfund 
reilly pledged in june to toughen toxic waste cleanup enforcement 
kovalick said that despite problems the cleanup effort isnt as bad 
as rands study suggests 
while only 34 dumps had been declared clean by september 1988 
kovalick said cleanup is under way on another 170 designs for waste 
isolation or treatment facilities or other cleanup work are in 
progress at another 230 dumps studies of the extent of 
contamination and cleanup options are under way for more than 640 
other waste sites kovalick said 
the 26 billion actually spent doesnt include formal epa 
obligations to pay for work now under way kovalick said only a 
fraction of cleanup costs has been recovered from polluters because 
its hard to recover the money until youve finished the cleanup 
project 
we think improvements are possible but substantial progress 
has been made kovalick said by telephone from washington 
rand blamed cleanup delays partly on epa sluggishness under 
expresident reagan when superfund official rita lavelle went to 
prison for perjured testimony to congress and on high staff 
turnover confused management failure to learn from experience and 
other inefficiencies at the agency 
but the study also suggested the cleanup effort is lagging due to 
court battles that occur because the superfund law requires the epa 
to make polluters perform or pay for the cleanup work whenever 
possible if companies responsible for pollution cant be identified 
or no longer exist then the superfund trust fund pays for the 
cleanup 
acton said that when the law comes before congress for 
reauthorization in 1991 lawmakers may want to ask is it more 
important to clean up the sites faster or is it more important to 
shift the financial burden to private parties 
under the current law he said we seem to be getting some of 
the worst of both worlds we set up an adversarial system so it 
cleanup work goes slower but then were not recovering very much 
in the way of costs 
but linda greer technical director of the hazardous waste 
treatment council which represents companies that do cleanup work 
said theres no reason for the american taxpayer to pay for 
industrial dumping if the polluting companies can be tracked down 
the chemical manufacturers association also believes the 
polluters should pay although many other polluters have fought to 
shift the cost to taxpayers spokesman tom gilroy said 
greer and lois epstein an engineer with the environmental 
defense fund blamed superfunds laggard pace on weak enforcement by 
the epa during the reagan years and footdragging by polluters 
trying to escape financial responsibility 
were optimistic that reilly is ready to improve the program 
epstein said 
the rand study said epa may recover another 824 million in 
cleanup costs spent through september 1988 and also has signed 
agreements with polluters who plan to clean their own dump sites 
with work valued at more than 1 billion 
acton acknowledged his study doesnt take into account voluntary 
cleanups performed by polluters fearful of being forced into more 
costly solutions by the epa

an admitted penny stock scam artist wearing a 
hood to conceal his identity told a house subcommittee thursday 
that penny stocks traded overthecounter are often controlled by 
organized crime 
lorenzo formato a former broker and promotor of the inexpensive 
but highly risky securities known as penny stocks testified that 
organized crime has their hand on the shoulder of someone inside 
any overthecounter brokerage thats making money 
formato is now in the federal witness protection program 
he told the energy and commerce subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance that although there are legitimate 
companies offering their stocks overthecounter they are often 
manipulated by brokers promoters or salesmen 
although their price a few cents up to a few dollars a share 
makes penny stocks attractive to small investors with limited funds 
many are prone to abuse because information about the issuing 
company often is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult 
to dispute 
small or young companies or those that trade infrequently or in 
a limited area are often listed only on socalled pink sheets 
rather than with larger and more stable companies brokers and 
investors must call a broker that deals in a specific companys 
shares to get a price quote 
according to a survey by state securities regulators american 
investors have been cheated out of at least 2 billion a year by 
crooked schemes involving penny stocks 
the national association of securities dealers a selfregulating 
organization that oversees overthecounter stock brokers said any 
investigation of organized crime links to the industry was in 
government hands 
were cracking down hard on unscrupulous penny stock brokers 
but were not elliott ness said robert ferri a nasd spokesman 
if an investigation has to go farther than our purview the law 
enforcement agency were dealing with will take it from there and 
thats quite often the fbi or the justice department 
penny stock swindles are now the no 1 threat of fraud and 
abuse facing small momandpop investors in the united states 
said rep edward j markey dmass the subcommittee chairman he 
called formatos testimony a blistering scalding indictment of 
the entire penny stock market 
formato entered the crowded congressional hearing room surrounded 
by federal marshals and wearing a gray hood with holes for his 
mouth nose and eyes he testified from behind a screen with his 
voice altered deliberately to protect his identity 
he said he got involved with the mob in his native new jersey to 
prevent competitors from trying to undercut him 
i needed the protection i needed the strength of organized 
crime he said 
but formato who is serving a sixyear prison sentence incognito 
declined to say what organized crime family he was involved with 
he pleaded guilty in 1987 to charges of income tax evasion mail 
fraud and interstate transportation of money taken in stock fraud 
according to robert warren a federal prosecutor in newark nj 
formato was the governments key witness at the trial of five 
people later convicted of participating in a penny stock fraud 
involving a bogus company laser arms corp that purported to have 
developed a selfchilling beverage can 
formato was described at the trial as one of the masterminds 
behind the scam in addition to the five convicted at trial nine 
other people pleaded guilty to charges involving laser arms 
formato gave several recommendations for cleaning up the penny 
stock market especially tougher penalties 
he said he used to laugh at the securities and exchange 
commission the watchdog of the stocks and bonds markets because it 
did not have the authority to put him behind bars 
i did not fear the securities and exchange commission 
formato said they could only attack me on a civil basis the 
people who bought the stocks lost their money 
there are thousands of people making millions of dollars doing 
what he did said john baldwin director of the utah division of 
securities 
baldwin is also president of the north american securities 
administrators association a washingtonbased organization of state 
securities regulators 
the evidence is clear and convincing penny stock fraud has 
evolved into a problem of truly national proportions said baldwin 
a report on nasaas 50state survey of securities regulators 
noted that investors in legitimate penny stocks are believed to 
lose all or some of their investment 70 percent of the time and the 
presence of fraud pushes up that figure to 90 percent 
the sec has created a penny stock task force and has adopted 
rules that will make tougher to sell penny stocks over the telephone

cuban government news agency prensa latina said thursday 
a communique from the revolutionary armed forces ministry said 
the decision to withdraw the troops was taken after the conditions 
of aggression and threats from abroad that made necessary our 
presence in that heroic land changed 
cuban military advisers and other specialists were sent to 
marxist ethiopia in april 1977 and later were joined by combat units 
who helped defeat somali rebels and troops in 1978 those troops 
which at one point reached 20000 were withdrawn and a small 
contingent was left behind as protection according to the

the state supreme court on thursday rejected 
an appeal by juan corona the farm labor contractor convicted of 
murdering 25 farm workers in 1971 
the justices unanimously denied a hearing on coronas challenge 
to a lowercourt ruling upholding his convictions he was sentenced 
to 25 years to life for each of the murders 
the bodies most of them stabbed or hacked to death were found 
in shallow graves in orchards in the marysvilleyuba city area 
defense lawyers denied coronas guilt and blamed the murders on a 
halfbrother now dead 
coronas first convictions were overturned on appeal because of a 
finding that his lawyer had acted incompetently and had a conflict 
of interest corona was convicted again at a second trial 
the 1st district court of appeal upheld the convictions in june 
despite finding that a reported confession by corona had been 
admitted into evidence improperly 
a mexican consul jesus rodriguez navarro testified at the 
second trial that corona had told him in 1978 he had killed the farm 
workers because he was a sick man 
under an international agreement consular officials cannot be 
required to testify about matters related to their official duties 
unless their government issues a written waiver the mexican 
government did not try to stop rodriguez from testifying but did not 
furnish a written waiver 
the appeals court said colusa county superior court judge richard 
patton who presided over the retrial should have excluded 
rodriguezs testimony and was wrong in deciding that the consul was 
authorized to waive the privilege of confidentiality on his own 
but the court in an opinion by justice donald king said 
coronas rights were not violated because the right of 
confidentiality was held legally by the mexican government not 
corona as a result king said the defense cannot complain that 
violation of that right deprived corona of a fair trial 
we are fully satisfied that coronas second trial was fair and 
that ultimately justice has been accomplished for both corona and 
the people of this state king said 
in seeking state supreme court review michael mendelsohn a 
lawyer for corona said hispanics were not represented adequately on 
the grand jury that indicted corona mendelsohn challenged the 
appeals courts conclusion that corona was required to show that the 
lack of hispanics had harmed his case

here are excerpts from a navy statement 
thursday on the investigation into the april 19 explosion aboard the 
uss iowa and from the unclassified version of the endorsement of the 
investigation by the chief of naval operations adm carlisle ah 
trost 
first from the statement 
the tragic loss of 47 personnel within turret ii and associated 
ammunition handling rooms precluded a precise causal determination 
since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions 
were those who lost their lives 
after an examination of all available evidence and extensive 
tests the investigation concluded that the explosion was most 
probably caused by an intentional act the weight of evidence 
indicates that some type of detonation device was deliberately 
placed between the powder bags being rammed into the breech of the 
center gun the most likely person with the access knowledge and 
possible motivation to accomplish this act has been identified as 
gunners mate 2nd class clayton m hartwig usn the center gun 
captain in turret ii at the time of the explosion 
the investigation resulted in a complete review of all aspects of 
gunnery operations on board uss iowa the investigating officer 
found deficiencies in training documentation ordnance handling 
requirements and safety procedures however exhaustive tests and 
duplication of the type of blast that occurred conclusively 
demonstrated that these shortcomings did not cause the explosion

<TEXT>
from adm trosts endorsement of the investigation 
on 19 april 1989 a rapid series of three explosions within turret 
ii aboard uss iowa resulted in the instantaneous deaths of 47 
american sailors a judge advocate generals manual investigation 
was convened immediately 
every conceivable source of ignition and every aspect of uss 
iowas condition and shipboard routine that might have bearing on 
the incident were evaluated routine procedures training safety 
manning and personal conduct 
since the primary explosion was determined to have occurred 
within the center gun room the focus of the investigation was 
properly directed to that location 
the tragic loss of personnel within turret ii and adjacent 
ammunition handling spaces precluded a precise causal determination 
since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions 
were those who lost their lives 
the initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five 
bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the 
breech open 
the point of ignition was most probably between the first and 
second bags exhaustive technical tests have ruled out the following 
possibilities which constitute the most logical inadvertent causes 
burning ember premature primer firing mechanical failure 
friction electromagnetic spark propellant instability and 
personnel procedural error 
although deficiencies in training documentation weapons handling 
procedures and adherence to safety procedures were found within the 
weapons department the exhaustive tests and duplication of the type 
of blast that occurred have conclusively demonstrated that these 
shortcomings did not cause the explosion 
the thought of an intentional wrongful act is repugnant to all 
professional seagoing men and women however this consideration had 
to be pursued when information surfaced that introduced its 
possibility 
extensive laboratory tests using optical and electronic 
microscopy revealed the existence of foreign elements not normally 
present in the 16inch guncharge 
an attempt by separate fbi analysis to correlate these elements 
with material associated with an improvised explosive device proved 
inconclusive 
additional hard factual evidence such as the position of the 
rammer and the subsequent delay in retracting the rammer to allow 
closing of the breech provides credibility to the theory that an 
intentional human act caused the ignition of the powder charge 
the critical controlling station within turret ii to allow the 
aforementioned factors to occur was that of the center gun captain 
these factors when combined with circumstantial evidence associated 
with the individual manning that gun captain position at the time of 
the explosion strongly suggest that an intentional human act most 
probably caused the premature ignition 
the evidence amassed includes 1 irrefutable facts on condition 
in the center gun room at the instant of the explosion such as the 
position of the rammer 2 the fact gmg2 clayton m hartwig was in 
the gun captain position and 3 significant circumstantial 
evidence documenting the lifestyle and thought patterns of gmg2 
hartwig over a lengthy period of time 
the combination of these factors leads me reluctantly to the 
conclusion that the most likely cause of the explosion was a 
detonation device deliberately introduced between powder bags that 
were being rammed into the breech of the center gun 
this caused premature detonation and the subsequent disastrous 
explosions aboard uss iowa on 19 april 1989 resulting in the 
deaths of 47 sailors including hartwig 
i further concur with the investigating officer and the 
subsequent endorsers that the preponderance of evidence supports the 
theory that the most likely person to have introduced the detonation 
device was gmg2 hartwig

a senate committee agreed thursday to 
permanently prohibit cigarette smoking on all domestic airline 
flights expanding the current ban on smoking on trips of two hours 
or less 
the restrictions were included in an 119 billion spending bill 
for fiscal 1990 transportation programs that the senate 
appropriations committee adopted by a 170 vote the measure is 
expected to reach the full senate next week 
its time to get on with protecting public health and safety 
and this is one way to make certain that happens said the sponsor 
of the restrictions sen frank lautenberg dnj 
by 1811 the lawmakers rejected an attempt by sen thad cochran 
rmiss to water down the proposal by making permanent the current 
ban on smoking on flights of two hours or less 
the issue as usual cut across party lines democrats on the 
panel opposed cochran by an 115 margin while republicans did the 
same 76 
the committee also rejected 158 an amendment by sen ernest 
hollings dsc that would have forbidden both smoking and alcohol 
drinking aboard airliners 
current restrictions which will otherwise expire next april 
cover 80 percent of all us airline routes lautenbergs proposal 
would take effect 90 days after the bill becomes law and would 
supersede the current prohibition if enacted before april 
housesenate negotiators must now work out compromise language 
before sending the measure to president bush for his signature the 
house voted aug 3 to make the current prohibition permanent 
the vote spelled yet another defeat for the tobacco industry and 
edged health groups and airline employee unions a step closer toward 
their latest victory 
supporters of the ban argue that with the recirculated air of 
airline cabins nonsmoking passengers face the risk of lung cancer 
and other diseases by breathing cigarette smoke 
opponents have claimed that health hazards from the fumes are 
unproven and that the ban hurts people who rely on cigarette sales 
for their jobs 
the previous system of separating smokers from nonsmokers 
worked and made the vast majority of people happy said brennan 
dawson spokeswoman for the tobacco institute the trade group for 
most of the nations cigarette manufacturers the industry pocketed 
35 billion in sales last year 
as under current law lautenbergs extension would levy fines of 
up to 1000 for passengers caught smoking and up to 2000 for 
people found to have disconnected smoke detectors in aircraft 
restrooms lavatories are considered the most dangerous spot for a 
fire on an airliner because of the paper stored there but they also

the spending bill would provide 73 billion for aviation 
programs 3 billion for the coast guard 122 billion for highway 
spending 3 billion for mass transit assistance and 615 million 
for amtrak the northeast passenger railroad besides the 119 
billion in new spending the measure would also allow 159 billion 
to be spent from money the government has collected from various 
fuel and airline passenger taxes 
the bush administration proposed spending 10 billion for 
transportation in fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 with lower 
spending for mass transit higher spending for aviation and no 
assistance for amtrak 
the senate measure includes 
355 million for subsidies paid to airlines that serve small

senate president larry tucker resigned 
thursday after his guilty plea to a felony charge was disclosed in 
federal court becoming west virginias latest state official to 
leave in disgrace this summer 
earlier thursday a defense lawyer told us district judge john 
t copenhaver jr that tucker has agreed to plead guilty to 
extortion on a charge that he accepted 10000 from racetrack 
officials seeking favorable legislation 
i just made a stupid mistake he told wsaztv in charleston 
the announcement came just before opening arguments in the us 
district court trial of tuckers predecessor as senate president 
marshall county democrat dan tonkovich tonkovich is charged with 
three counts of extortion two counts of attempted extortion and one 
count of racketeering 
tucker also a democrat is listed as a defense witness for 
tonkovich who is accused of soliciting money from groups that had 
legislation pending before the senate 
tonkovichs lawyer james lees told copenhaver he was unaware of 
tucker signing an agreement to plead guilty when he placed the 
senate president on his list of defense witnesses 
among other west virginia democratic officials who have resigned 
or pleaded guilty this summer are attorney general charlie brown 
who resigned as part of an agreement in which a grand jury 
investigation of him was halted state treasurer a james manchin 
who resigned to halt his removal trial in the state senate on 17 
impeachment counts and state sen si boettner who pleaded guilty 
to a felony income tax charge and resigned 
tonkovichs former top aide bob cain recently pleaded guilty to 
a federal tax charge 
federal prosecutors had previously filed documents alleging that 
tonkovich supported legislation in 1987 favorable to tristate 
greyhound park in cross lanes in exchange for 10000 from track 
coowner bill ellis at the time tucker was senate judiciary 
chairman and tonkovich was senate president 
ellis could not be reached for comment thursday but he 
previously denied any wrongdoing 
tucker 54 told wsaz he accepted 10000 from race track 
lobbyist sam dannunzio then unsuccessfully tried to return it to 
him he said dannunzio refused to accept the money 
dannunzio eventually cooperated with federal prosecutors in 
their investigation of the legislature and he committed suicide in 
december 1988 
senate clerk darrell holmes said tucker submitted a onesentence 
letter of resignation thursday afternoon 
tucker a twoterm senator was elected president in 1989 after 
tonkovich gave up his senate seat for an unsuccessful campaign for 
the democratic nomination for governor 
under legislative rules senate president protem tony whitlow 
will serve as acting president until a replacement is elected by the 
full senate holmes said 
the state constitution requires the governor to call a special 
session of the senate within 10 days so a new president can be 
elected holmes said

the government today claimed troops 
battling usbacked moslem rebels had regained control over areas 
surrounding the eastern border city of khost after two weeks of 
heavy fighting 
the battle is completely over lt gen abdul ulumi 
secretary of the supreme defense council told a news conference in 
the afghan capital there was no immediate confirmation or denial of 
his claim 
ulumi said at least 3500 mujahedeen rebels had attacked the 
city just 10 miles from the border with pakistan where most of the 
rebels are based he claimed 1000 rebels were killed and 1000 
wounded in the fighting 
a rebel victory at khost would have opened a direct rebel supply 
link from pakistan to fighters in northern and western afghanistan 
convoys supplied at depots in pakistan are now forced to take long 
routes around khost to reach upper afghanistan where the 
countryside is largely controlled by the rebels ulumi said the 
fighting ended after government forces recently took back two 
military posts at tani 10 miles south of the city he would not 
confirm when but government sources said the posts were retaken in 
fighting overnight wednesday 
we are back in the positions we were in around khost when the 
attack was launched aug 24 ulumi said 
ulumi told the mujahedeen who have not had a significant 
military victory since the soviet troops withdrew from afghanistan 
in february after nine years of fighting that it was futile to 
continue trying to capture the country 
those who imagine they can capture afghanistan will only take 
their coffins with them back to pakistan he said 
the mujahedeen have previously launched attacks on kandahar the 
countrys secondlargest city and jalalabad a strategically vital 
town east of kabul both attacks have bogged down reflecting the 
rebels inability to switch from their previously successful 
guerrilla tactics to more conventional warfare 
ulumi also said the afghan air force had acquired soviet mig29 
jet fighters and sukhoy27 interceptors but had not used the planes 
in combat the battle of attrition between both sides has usually 
been confined to ground fighting although the government has been 
using airplanes and helicopter gunships to strafe rebel positions

a proposal to strengthen automobile 
fuelefficiency requirements is unrealistic and could lead the 
industry to compromise safety and cut its work force labor and 
industry leaders said thursday 
but supporters said the bill was needed to reverse trends toward 
us reliance on foreign oil and global warming they accused the 
industry of exaggerating the difficulty of meeting the proposed 
standards and their economic impact 
your predecessors in effect forecast the collapse of 
western civilization as we know it in 1974 when they lobbied 
against the original corporate average fuel economy law sen 
richard h bryan dnev told industry representatives at a hearing 
of the commerce science and technology consumer subcommittee 
why should i believe you based upon your previous testimony 
asked bryan chairman of the subcommittee 
bryan wants to require a 20 percent improvement in fuel 
efficiency from the current fleet average by 1995 and a 40 percent 
improvement by 2000 
the current law requires each manufacturers fleet of new cars 
and light trucks sold in the unites states average at least 275 
miles per gallon for general motors the bryan bill would require a 
minimum of 33 mpg in 1995 and 40 mpg by 2000 said marina n 
whitman a gm vice president 
strengthening the law this year would be especially burdensome 
for the industry which already faces higher costs should congress 
approve president bushs demand for lower emissions of nitrogen 
oxides ms whitman said various federal laws and regulations are 
requiring air bags larger air conditioners and antilock brakes 
adding still more costs she said 
the law fails because the law pressures producers to build 
still more fuelefficient vehicles without creating incentives for 
consumers to buy them she said 
foreigncar manufacturers complained the bryan proposal would 
punish those who have exceeded the 1974 laws requirements by 
forcing them to improve efficiency by the same proportion as those 
who have not 
not only will this reduce competition among companies to 
improve fuel economy but it will prevent consumers from having a 
pricecompetitive range of products from which to choose said hal 
bracken a toyota vice president 
owen bieber president of united auto workers told the panel 
that cars probably would become more fuelefficient but that 
specific targets should not be a matter of law 
bryan said his bill would save the country 491 billion gallons 
of fuel and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 483 million 
tons between 1995 and 2001 
while we no longer wait anxiously as opec meets in vienna 
america is becoming more dependent on imported oil he said 
sen albert gore dtenn is pushing a separate idea to levy a 
fee on auto emissions and granting a rebate to owners of 
fuelefficient vehicles

solidarity leader lech walesa said 
thursday he is concerned about a few voices in west germany that 
question the legality of polands western border 
the polish union leader and nobel peace laureate delivering a 
speech in bonn before about 1000 people also pleaded anew for 
major western investment to help stave off the collapse of polands 
battered economy 
in duesseldorf earlier thursday walesa welcomed us proposals 
to aid poland but said the united states and europe should do far 
more 
polands new solidarityled government is struggling to revive 
the countrys economy weighed down by inefficient state companies 
shortages of goods and a 39 billion foreign debt 
walesa stressed that without major economic investment reform 
could be in jeopardy not only in poland but elsewhere in east 
europe he said poles are ready to make sacrifices to attract 
western business investment 
he also addressed efforts by poland and west germany to forge 
closer ties bitter feelings linger in both countries stemming from 
nazi germanys invasion of poland 50 years ago the start of world 
war ii 
walesa on the third day of a fourday visit said he is 
optimistic about intensifying west germanpolish relations but he 
said the first basis for that is the inviolability of our 
borders 
we are concerned about a few voices in the federal republic 
relating to the allegedly open question about the western 
border walesa said 
it would be useful if this topic were no longer present in the 
bilateral relations 
he called such discussion a waste of time 
finance minister theodor waigel and some other archconservative 
west german politicians have suggested former german lands now in 
poland technically still belong to germany because a peace treaty 
was never signed establishing the border 
resentment continues among many west germans about the forced 
removal of millions of germans from the nowpolish lands after world 
war ii 
but west german chancellor helmut kohl reassured poland this 
country makes no claim to the lands and abides by the 1970 west 
germanpolish treaty in which both countries pledged to respect 
existing borders 
walesa said he is not comforted when archconservatives in west 
germany say they are only pointing out a legal technicality 
if it is possible to interpret the situation in two different 
ways then perhaps the situation should be changed he said 
walesa also said he was concerned by resentment among some west 
germans about ethnic germans who came here from poland and other 
east bloc nations seeking better living conditions 
a rise in ultraright sentiment in west germany has been at least 
partly attributed to an increasing wave of refugees 
this emigration problem activates a wave of intolerance 
and provokes nationalistic feelings people we must take charge and 
find humanitarian solutions walesa said 
kohl met with walesa on thursday and called for a new beginning 
in polishwest german relations calling this especially important 
on the 50th anniversary of the start of world war ii 
in duesseldorf walesa was asked about proposed legislation in 
the us senate that would provide aid of up to 300 million a year 
and ease polands foreign debt burden 
president bush has already proposed 100 million in us 
assistance to poland 
although asked about the senate initiative walesa instead 
referred to bushs proposal saying what bush did is in the right 
direction 
this is not enough for the improvement of living conditions in 
poland it should be seen as having symbolic value it should show 
people the way it should animate people 
walesa asked again that the united states and other western 
nations invest 10 billion in poland

the former chairman of the house committee that 
investigated the irancontra scandal said thursday that so many 
questions remain about the role of president bush and others that 
congress should not yet close the books on the affair 
rep lee hamilton dind asked that the house intelligence 
committee begin a continuing investigation of new documents and 
other evidence that have surfaced in the trial of former marine lt 
col oliver north or which may surface during other upcoming trials 
of irancontra figures 
congressional investigators in late 1987 concluded that top 
reagan administration officials had circumvented the law to sell 
arms to iran and generate money to buy weapons for nicaraguas 
contra rebels but the yearlong probe failed to fully pinpoint the 
extent of personal responsibility of reagan bush and others 
most importantly we still do not understand precisely what 
were the roles in these events of president reagan vice president 
bush and other top reagan administration officials hamilton said 
in a letter to intelligence committee chairman rep anthony c 
beilenson dcalif 
congress was charged with the responsibility to investigate 
these events thoroughly and to understand them as best we could we 
will have failed to discharge fully that responsibility if we leave 
important evidence unexplored hamilton wrote 
in light of the importance of the questions that remain and the 
enormous implications of the events that have occurred i do not 
believe we can consider the congressional investigation of the 
irancontra affair to be complete 
hamilton acknowledged that there is a certain weariness with the 
matter on capitol hill but noted that each new effort to dig back 
into the affair has shed new light 
he asked that as part of its continuing probe the intelligence 
panel ask the bush white house to undertake a comprehensive search 
of all relevant reagan administration files including the heads 
of state file recently discovered at the reagan library in 
california 
it is possible that other important documents were missed by 
have not yet come to light hamilton wrote 
he also asked that the committee evaluate the seven new documents 
turned up at the north trial which strongly suggested a reagan 
administration deal with the honduran government under which the 
hondurans would help the contras in return for increased us aid

congress is conducting at least four 
investigations of possible security and conflictofinterest 
problems at an energy department laboratory that performs topsecret 
nuclear weapons work congressional sources said thursday 
the newest probe launched in july by the house energy and 
commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee focuses on the 
terms under which the lawrence livermore national laboratory 
transferred a new computer technology to a company led by former lab 
scientists who had helped develop the technology 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the subcommittee has 
raised ethics questions about the deal although lab and company 
officials deny any wrongdoing 
congressional sources involved in the probes disclosed thursday 
that lab officials also are under investigation for allegedly 
failing to protect important security assets at the site near 
livermore calif 
the sources who spoke on the condition they not be identified 
declined to reveal details of the security lapse but said john tuck 
the energy undersecretary acknowledged in a closed hearing in july 
that the problem posed an unacceptable risk to national security 
immediate corrective actions were promised they said 
a reporters telephone call to tuck was not returned 
plutonium and other sensitive materials are used at lawrence 
livermore in nuclear weapons design and research activities the 
lab one of three major weapons design facilities is operated by 
the university of california under an energy department contract 
the dingell subcommittee also is investigating the national 
security implications of an allegation by roy woodruff formerly a 
leader of the labs weapons program woodruff contends he was 
blocked by lab superiors from writing to national security officials 
in washington in 198385 to dispute optimistic projections by 
physicist edward teller about the xray laser weapon being developed 
there 
the xray laser uses the energy of a nuclear explosion in space 
to destroy enemy rocket boosters 
separately the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress is probing allegations of thefts of government property 
at the lab this probe was launched last year after dingells panel 
was told in a public hearing that some lab employees had sold 
computers and other government assets for drug money 
the lab in 1986 launched its own investigation of drug 
trafficking by employees after a number of workers became involved 
in drugrelated incidents and arrests dingell later accused the 
energy department of pressuring the investigators to drop the matter 
just days before they were to enter the highestsecurity sections of 
the lab 
dingell stepped up pressure on energy secretary james d watkins 
to review the university of californias management of lawrence 
livermore by pressing him for information about the circumstances of 
a licensing deal the lab made earlier this year with nchip inc a 
livermorebased company started by former lab scientists 
the departments internal auditors also are investigating the 
licensing deal at the request of the departments san francisco 
field office which oversees the lab operations 
in a july 7 letter to watkins a copy of which was made public on 
wednesday dingell called the awarding of the license to nchip to 
commercially develop a technology known as laser pantography 
highly curious 
he cited the appearance of a conflict of interest in granting 
an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at 
least three people who helped lawrence livermore develop the 
technology 
laser pantography is used for connecting computer chips in a way 
that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a 
cigarette pack 
in a telephone interview thursday philip dauber the chairman of 
nchip said his company and the lab took special care to meet all 
ethical and legal requirements for the licensing deal he called it 
a normal usual patenting agreement

president bush asked congress on thursday for 
the downpayment on a 150 million aid package for poland and 
hungary and the white house said it might increase the amount if 
more economic and political reforms are adopted by those countries 
for the fiscal year beginning oct 1 bush requested 335 
million 
well always be looking for opportunties to increase that aid 
but we believe certain economic reforms and political reforms are 
necessary as a link with any real increases in aid so we have some 
assurances that it is indeed revitalizing the polish economy 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
he said bush wrote to congressional leaders and asked for rapid 
approval of his request 
in addition to the economic aid the administration is preparing 
a 58 million package of food aid for poland that is expected to be 
ready around oct 1 fitzwater said we want to get all the food 
aid in there we can 
bush announced the 150 million package during his july trip to 
poland and hungary some members of congress have urged the 
administration to expand the package to reward the installation of 
solidarity member tadeusz mazowiecki as prime minister of poland 
the president discussed the package along with other subjects 
with republican members of congress during a meeting at the white 
house 
senate minority leader robert dole rkan who earlier had 
recommended a higher figure said i think hes doing what he 
should do in providing the leadership working with the western 
alliance 
dole said the bottom line is its primarily the 
responsibility of poland 
sen pete v domenici rnm said he recommended to bush that 
he name a task force of american businessmen labor leaders and 
others to work with polands government to identify the reforms it 
should adopt to get from a communist economic base to a more 
productive base 
fitzwater said the idea is being considered 
in july bush said he would provide poland with 100 million to 
spur private enterprise and 15 million for environmental projects 
hungary is to receive 25 million for entrepreneurial projects and 
5 million for environmental projects bush also requested 5

common cause accused the federal election 
commission thursday of falling down on its job of policing federal 
campaign finance laws claiming the fecs seemingly willful 
refusal to act has encouraged illegal practices 
the selfstyled citizens lobby said the problems are so pervasive 
the best albeit drastic remedy may be to abolish the fec 
altogether and to create a new election law enforcement agency 
the fec in recent years increasingly has abdicated its most 
basic responsibility to enforce the law common cause said in a 
report 
fred eiland a spokesman for the election commission said he 
wasnt certain whether the agency would issue a response common 
cause is an enduring critic of the fec and has sued the agency 
frequently 
the failure to enforce the federal campaign finance laws 
springs both from the structural defects congress created in the 
agency and from the recalcitrance of the commissioners themselves 
the study said congress virtually has ignored the fecs failure 
to enforce the law 
under laws passed after the watergate scandals in the early 
1970s the fec is charged with administering public funding of 
presidential campaigns policing public disclosure interpreting 
laws pertaining to presidential and congressional elections 
investigating alleged violations and undertaking enforcement actions 
common cause spotlighted socalled soft money practices in 
which contributions from corporations labor unions and invididuals 
are channeled to state and political party organizations 
the study said that in 1988 the presidential campaigns of george 
bush and michael dukakis together raised up to 50 million in soft 
money contributions from corporations labor unions and individuals 
in donations as large as 100000 money that is strictly prohibited 
in federal elections campaigns 
although this occurred in full public view the fec took no 
action to stop it in spite of a federal court decision ordering the 
agency to issue new soft money rules 
the study said by its inaction the fec virtually issued an 
invitation to presidential campaigns to continue violating the law 
an invitation which both presidential campaigns seized upon 
common cause said such inaction discourages voluntary compliance 
with the law encourages noncompliance to the point where the 
integrity of the presidential campaign finance system in particular 
is now at risk 
the advocacy group praised the fec for performing well in the 
areas of public disclosure of campaign records and administering the 
distributions of public funds

white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
thursday there was no difference of opinion between president bush 
and vice president dan quayle on the strategic defense initiative 
the spokesman also said that former president reagan had not 
exaggerated the potential ability of sdi to defend against incoming 
nuclear missiles 
the los angeles times published an interview with quayle on 
thursday in which the vice president suggested that reagan had 
resorted to political jargon in his original 1983 sales pitch 
for a multibilliondollar research effort aimed at creating a 
spacebased defense shield 
quayle said reagan in launching his sdi initiative talked 
about this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leak 
proof 
i believe that in the semantics of lets say political jargon 
that that was acceptable but it clearly was stretching the 
capability of a strategic defense system said the vice president 
fitzwater said quayles comments reflected the fact that we 
have been able to winnow the objectives of the program to fit 
more definable kinds of objectives 
he said there was no difference between bush and quayle on 
sdi 
quayle was just saying there was some strange language 
associated with some of the discussion of it said fitzwater 
but he believes in it 
referring to quayles political jargon phrase fitzwater 
added the only thing we have different today is two inflammatory 
words 
fitzwater said bush still has not given up the goal of perfecting 
a space shield against all incoming nuclear missiles 
thats kind of the goal that you keep working for said 
fitzwater 
the ultimate goal he added remains a space shield that 
protects against the intercontinental ballistic missiles 
quayle an early ardent advocate of sdi said in the interview 
that the ongoing research effort on sdi has been clearly 
rethought with emphasis on an approach called brilliant 
pebbles that would rely on clusters of minimissiles to track and 
knock out incoming rockets 
we have redefined star wars and put it into missions 
requirements doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in 
the early 1980s quayle said 
quayle said the new emphasis could help protect the united states 
against an accidental launch or a limited nuclear attack rather 
than an allout boltoutoftheblue attack by the soviets 
the administrations request for 49 billion for sdi research 
for fiscal 1990 is under attack on capitol hill where the house 
wants to cut 18 billion from the program

the us ambassador to lebanon john mccarthy 
said thursday he hopes to be able to return to beirut as soon as 
the situation is calm again 
mccarthy and 29 members of the us embassy staff were evacuated 
from beirut wednesday after a christian commander in the embattled 
city had voiced threatening remarks 
mccarthy spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived at dulles 
international airport on a flight from frankfurt west germany 
any embassy has to rely on the host government authorities to 
provide protection he said when we felt that that wasnt being 
provided any more we had to leave 
asked whether the united states was washing its hands of beirut 
mccarthy replied 
never were very interested in whats happening in lebanon we 
have a strong attachment to the lebanese people 
the ambassador was asked whether the evacuation of him and the 
embassy staff would have any impact on efforts to free western 
hostages believed held in beirut 
mccarthy said that while the us embassy was located in 
christian east beirut the hostages are believed to be held captive 
in moslem west beirut movements of americans assigned to the 
embassy had been restricted to east beirut 
for that reason he said our absence from beirut will 
unfortunately not really impact significantly on what we know about 
the hostages 
the envoy was met at the airport was met by his wife marija and 
their 11yearold daughter julia 
earlier thursday the state department renewed its allegation 
that a christian commander in lebanon had threatened to take 20 
americans hostage 
i view it as a threat spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
of general michel aouns remark to the french newspaper figaro that 
taking hostages was evidently the way to get us attention 
aoun had complained in the interview that the united states was 
not paying enough attention to the war in his country between 
christians and moslems backed by syria 
in reply ms tutwiler said the bush administration had taken an 
active role in seeking a settlement 
she said president bush and secretary of state james a baker iii 
had called for a ceasefire and us ambassadors and government 
officials in the middle east were working toward that end 
i think we have been engaged ms tutwiler said

the navys conclusion that a gunners mate probably caused a 
deadly explosion on the battleship uss iowa was met thursday with 
harsh criticism from his family and skepticism from other sailors 
the navy has concocted this fable in an attempt to shift 
the blame away from its dismal track record in their operation of 
this battleship and lay the blame on a dead sailor who isnt here to 
defend himself said kreig j brusnahan an attorney for the 
family of clayton hartwig 
in a report released at the pentagon the navy said hartwig 
probably placed a detonator between gunpowder bags in one of the 
battleships 16inch guns the april 19 blast killed 47 sailors 
including hartwig who was the gun captain or supervisor of loading 
the weapon and with its world war iivintage ammuntion 
the idea that one man blew up 47 others i dont find it 
feasible i think it was somehow an accident said a petty officer 
second class at the uss iowas home port norfolk va he declined 
to give his name if the man wanted to commit suicide there are a 
lot of other ways to do it without taking 47 of your crewmates with 
you 
retired rear adm eugene carroll deputy director of the center 
for defense information in washington called the finding a very 
very farreaching grasping at straws he said the report 
criticized the equipment maintenance and crew training but did not 
blame those factors for the explosion 
this probable cause diverts attention from the question of the 
performance of the equipment and the personnel he said 
others defended the navys investigation 
i dont think its a copout said electricians mate 3rd 
class michael glass who is stationed aboard the amphibious cargo 
ship charleston in norfolk 
i would say the navy investigative service has probably done 
their homework they probably know for a fact or have enough 
evidence circumstantial or not to back up this theory said 
steven haight of norfolk who retired from the navy after 20 years 
most in intelligence 
the report on the explosion was delivered to the ship wednesday 
during a port call in gaeta italy said capt paul hanley an 
atlantic fleet spokesman the iowa left norfolk in june for six 
months in the mediterranean sea 
a criminal investigation of the explosion was launched after 
hartwigs sister kathy kubicina disclosed the existence of a 
100000 accidental death and dismemberment policy on her brothers 
life naming gunners mate 3rd class kendall truitt as a beneficiary 
at a news conference in miami truitts attorney ellis rubin 
dismissed the navys version of the explosion which he said is 
nothing more than speculation 
our information was that it was the navys negligence 
untrained and unqualified crew members and 50year old technology 
dangerous from day one said rubin 
truitt had expected to attend the news conference but was 
ordered to remain at the mayport naval station in jacksonville 
fla until too late to catch a flight for miami rubin said 
harwigs family in cleveland was briefed on the iowa report by a 
threemember navy contingent on thursday 
hartwigs father earl v hartwig a navy veteran said he was 
unconvinced that his son or any other crew member had caused the 
explosion 
i think there was a powder explosion accidental earl 
hartwig said 
ive never believed it right from the start ms kubicina 
said when asked if she thought her brother had caused the blast 
ms kubicina and her father said they wanted a congressional 
investigation into the navys handling of the iowa probe ms 
kubicina also said the family is planning a defamation lawsuit 
against the navy

residents vote saturday on three 
proposed changes to state government in a special election that 
could serve as a referendum on gov gaston captertons first eight 
months in office 
caperton a democrat could win broad new powers if two of the 
measures pass 
one amendment eliminates three statewide elected offices 
secretary of state treasurer and agriculture commissioner and 
places their duties under the governors control the second gives 
the governor control of the state primary and secondary education 
system taking it away from the largely independent state board of 
education the third gives cities and counties the ability to merge 
or choose new forms of government 
leading the campaign against the first amendment are two of the 
officeholders secretary of state ken hechler a democrat and 
agriculture commissioner cleve benedict a republican 
this is a much larger issue than party loyalty benedict 
said this is a very fundamental choice on who we ken hechler and 
i trust to exercise power whether we trust citizens at the ballot 
box or whether we trust the political elite 
hechler and benedict both former congressmen say they arent 
campaigning just to save their jobs the amendment wouldnt take 
effect until their terms end in 1992 
im just a temporary occupant said hechler it belongs to 
the people and future generations ought to continue to have the 
right to choose whoever they want 
the third official treasurer thomas loehr supports capertons 
plan caperton appointed loehr to the post in july after twoterm 
treasurer a james manchin resigned rather than face trial in the 
state senate over the loss of 279 million from an investment fund 
his office supervised 
caperton contends he can save 3 million a year by assigning the 
officeholders duties to other officials 
this is not a turf war caperton said in his weekly radio 
address last weekend its an economic battle 
he said critics who accuse him of a power grab are distorting the 
issue 
saturdays election comes at a time of widespread trouble in west 
virginia politics in addition to manchins resignation attorney 
general charlie brown resigned aug 21 to halt a grand jury 
investigation of his campaign financial records and allegations that 
he lied under oath 
former state senate president dan tonkovich went on trial 
thursday on federal extortion and racketeering charges three 
others include the former senate majority leader pleaded guilty to 
lesser charges in exchange for their testimony for the government 
supporters and opponents say the special election for 868802 
registered voters could turn into a referendum on capertons first 
eight months in office 
caperton a millionaire businessman won a landslide victory last 
november over republican incumbent arch moore one of his first acts 
was to push through the largest tax increase in state history 392 
million despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes 
theres a lot of anger out there about the tax increase a lot 
of anger about politics of the past about broken promises 
benedict said those are all probably going to be factors in the 
outcome 
former gov cecil underwood who is supporting the amendments 
agreed that capertons job performance will be a factor 
constitutional revision should never be a referendum on the 
incumbent underwood said at the same time it is almost 
impossible to keep that element out of the issue 
a statewide survey conducted aug 1923 for the associated press 
the charleston daily mail and wsaztv showed that twothirds of the 
registered voters surveyed knew little about the amendments but a 
majority said they would vote against the two measures that would 
give the governor more power 
the secretary of states office maintains records regarding 
corporations and supervises state election laws the agriculture 
department regulates farming and provides assistance to farmers and 
gardeners the treasurers office handles state investments and 
maintains the states bank deposits 
if voters approve the amendment the remaining elected statewide 
jobs will be governor attorney general and auditor

navy admirals said thursday it would be 
virtually impossible to guard against the type of suicidal behavior 
they believe caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard that 
uss iowa last april 19 
a navy report said circumstantial evidence indicated gunners 
mate clayton m hartwig who was closest to the breech in the middle 
gun of turret no 2 dropped a detonator between bags of gun powder 
being loaded during firing exercises off puerto rico 
as with any catastrophe the immediate impulse is to take every 
possible step to prevent a recurrence wrote adm carlisle ah 
trost the chief of naval operations and the top officer in the navy 
but trost said it is virtually impossible to have established 
procedures to absolutely preclude disastrous results of such an 
individual choice 
documents released with the report show hartwig was depressed 
over the collapse of a close friendship and one letter from hartwig 
11 days before the explosion eulogized sailors who died in action 
and said i could become one of those little white headstones in 
arlington national cemetery 
the report said hartwig was emotionally capable of committing 
suicide probably with the intent of killing others also 
the report used the words repugnant and incredulous to 
describe the idea that an intentional human act sparked the 
blast but concluded that hartwig was the principle suspect 
we dont know the motivation said adm leon edney the vice 
chief of naval operations 
edney told a pentagon press conference the navy did not plan to 
change its psychological screening procedures 
we didnt see anything that required a drastic change he 
said 
hartwigs allegedly suicidal character only became apparent after 
interviews with his acquaintances and family over the course of the 
fourmonth investigation edney said 
he was a cleancut sailor he didnt smoke he didnt drink he 
didnt carouse on leave he wasnt a troublemaker said edney 
the investigation also uncovered lax procedures aboard the iowa 
the report said and the navy announced immediate steps to correct 
them 
the circumstances of the explosion are muddied by a number of 
major administrative and supervisory discrepancies on board the uss 
iowa as well as substantial and serious failures by senior uss iowa 
personnel to properly discharge their responsibilities adm 
powell f carter commander of the atlantic fleet said in a letter 
released with the report 
but carter wrote exhaustive testing and evaluation has 
virtually ruled out any of these discrepancies as directly causing 
the deaths of the 47 crewmembers in turret 2 
nevertheless the number and egregriousness o the discrepancies 
create an impression of laxity and disregard that will cloud the 
investigations in the minds of nonexperts for the immediate 
future carter wrote 
among the problems cited in the report were a failure to fully 
train sailors in the gun turret on firing procedures 
to prevent a repeat all battleship weapons departments are to 
be inspected and deficiencies corrected prior to authorizing full 
unrestricted use of 16inch gun systems the report said 
rear adm richard d milligan who led the investigation 
concluded after numerous tests none of the irregularities could have 
sparked the blast 
he began to investigate the possbibility that the explosion was 
intentional after receiving a letter from hartwigs sister kathy 
kubicina saying hartwig meant to change the beneficary of a 
100000 accident death insurance policy to his parents from another 
sailor aboard the iowa kendall truitt 
truitt was once a close personal friend of hartwig but the 
friendship had cooled after truitt became involved with a woman 
milligan said 
although milligan said he found no evidence that hartwig was a 
homosexual documents released with the report show investigators 
were examining possible homosexual activity and hartwigs 
alleged homosexuality

the national party government 
promised reform thursday after suffering heavy losses in an election 
accompanied by protests and political violence in which 25 people 
were reported killed 
if the death toll is confirmed it would be the highest in a 
24hour period since 69 blacks were shot to death during a peaceful 
protest in sharpeville township in 1960 
in wednesdays white parliamentary election the nationalists got 
less than 50 percent of the vote for the first time since 1953 they 
lost nearly a quarter of their seats to an antiapartheid party and 
to a farright group that favors strict racial segregation 
police used shotguns tear gas and whips on antielection 
protesters in black and mixedrace townships outside cape town 
essa moosa and associates a prominent cape town law firm said 
25 people were killed wednesday night and early thursday in seven 
townships on the sprawling cape flats activists blamed most of the 
killings on police 
desmond tutu the black anglican archbishop said 23 people were 
killed and we expect the numbers of the dead to grow the 
newspaper grassroots said it had confirmed 15 of the bodies were in 
a mortuary 
one victim was a 69yearold woman whose headless body was found 
riddled with bullets said the star of johannesburg the countrys 
largest newspaper the western province council of churches said at 
least 100 people were injured including children 
leon mellet spokesman for the law and order ministry confirmed 
12 deaths he said at least seven were related to black factional 
fighting and the others were being investigated 
south african press association an independent news agency said 
the cape flats resembled a war zone as residents danced around 
dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in the area and police 
fired repeatedly at groups of youths 
a mixedrace lieutenant said police caused riots tuesday in the 
mitchells plain area of cape town 
lt gregory rockman said police were just hitting people they 
couldnt care if they were innocent bystanders it seemed to me that 
they were enjoying themselves feasting on the people you could 
just see the killer instinct in their eyes 
activists said 11 people were reported killed wednesday night in 
mitchells plain police would not comment on rockmans remarks 
violence resumed thursday afternoon when police with shotguns 
opened fire on dancing and chanting teenagers in the mixedrace 
lavender hill township said a journalist at the scene four people 
were reportedly killed in the township the night before 
the rev allan boesak a prominent activist said the presidency 
of fw de klerk now sits in a pool of blood 
i dont know how people can become vaguely excited about these 
elections when the man with a new vision has allowed this kind 
of massacre to take place boesak said 
the outlawed african national congress the main black group 
fighting white rule said from harare zimbabwe the elections 
were a farce and irrelevant to the anc and the oppressed majority 
of south africa 
de klerk described the election result as a clear mandate for 
his partys gradual political reforms which envision bringing 
blacks into the national government on a limited basis within five 
years 
seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring 
renewal and reform and granting political rights he said 
linking the national party with the liberalminded democrats 
he now is acting president an electoral college is expected to 
given him a full fiveyear term next week 
south africas 5 million whites control the government and the 28 
million blacks have no voice in national affairs separate 
parliament chambers for people of mixed race and indian descent were 
established in 1984 but have little power 
the national party in power since 1948 dropped form 123 seats 
to 93 in the 166seat white chamber and received 485 percent of the 
vote 
voters gave the farright conservative party 39 seats compared 
with 22 in the old parliament and 312 percent of the vote the 
antiapartheid democrats who favor a vote of equal weight for every 
south african went from 20 seats to 33 with the support of 20 
percent of the white electorate 
another election will be held in one rural district because of a 
tie between conservative and national party candidates officials 
said 
de klerk said emphasis must be on intensive dialogue and 
hopefully from that must flow real negotiations with blacks 
in washington the state department issued a statement that 
congratulated de klerk on his partys victory then said 
apartheid must end the elections themselves once more underscore 
the systematic denial of political rights to the majority population 
in south africa promises of reform must be followed by 
concrete specific action 
elections for the mixedrace and indian chambers also were held 
wednesday but antiapartheid activists urged a boycott and fewer 
than 10 percent of voters turned out in some districts 
the mass democratic movement which organized a nationwide 
defiance campaign in the past several weeks said about 3 million 
people joined a general strike wednesday it claimed more people 
participated in our protest action against the racist elections than 
voted

thwart us forces canal defense missions or endanger military and 
civilian personnel if it prevented the reception of emergency 
command advisories

were unavailing 
jamming occurs when there are news reports about panama or

officials of two dozen western nations 
will hold a conference sept 26 on ways to provide badly needed 
economic aid to poland and hungary the european community said 
thursday 
more than 100 officials met last month at the 12nation trading 
blocs brussels headquarters for an initial assessment of the need 
and of aid available for the two reformminded communist nations 
a spokesman for the european community who demanded anonymity 
said the conference would consider aid programs already begun and 
that another highlevel meeting may be scheduled for later this year 
president bush and leaders of other affluent democracies asked 
during their annual economic summit in july that the ec coordinate 
economic aid for poland and hungary 
western nations want to encourage the trend toward economic and 
political reform in both countries 
the european community said it began emergency shipments of beef 
to poland this week and half the total of 10000 tons was expected 
to arrive next week it is part of a 120 million food aid package 
for poland agreed to in july by agriculture ministers of the 12

five us technicians came to brazil at 
government request on thursday to help investigate why a brazilian 
jetliner crashed far off course in the amazon jungle killing at 
least 10 of the 54 people aboard 
varig airlines president helio smidt did not rule out the 
possibility of pilot error 
i would be very happy if human failure could be ruled out he 
told reporters thursday but we do not want to jump to 
conclusions 
the pilot cesar garces 32 did not speak with the press after 
arriving in brasilia on wednesday 
sixteen survivors of the sunday night crash left the hospital on 
thursday of the 35 survivors treated at the brasilia base hospital

flight between sao paulo and belem at the mouth of the amazon river 
after six scheduled stops the plane took off from maraba at 525 
pm for what was supposed to be a 41minute flight to belem 
but the plane strayed far off course circled above dense 
tropical jungle for three hours then crashlanded near sao jose do 
xingu in northcentral mato grosso state with just 15 minutes of 
fuel left authorities said

surivivor epaminondas de sousa chaves 36 said wednesday that 
soon after takeoff from maraba the pilot began heading southeast 
instead of north 
thirty minutes later the pilot told us to prepare for the

islands said chaves 
at least three other survivors interviewed by the associated 
press agreed with chaves account 
two other survivors rita de cassia and elza gasparim said the 
plane at one point descended as if it were going to land then

minutes of fuel left 
the planes belly clipped the top of the 100foothigh trees the

the senate forced to choose between preserving 
its members massmailing privileges and approving aid for drug 
rehabilitation programs voted overwhelmingly thursday to give 45 
million to help addicted pregnant women mothers and infants 
faced with a recorded vote on whether to slash money for 
unsolicited mailings the senate decided 838 to approve the 
amendment which was attached to a 2 billion legislativeexpense 
budget for fiscal 1990 
it was the first such assistance measure acted upon by either 
chamber since president bush announced his 79 billion antidrug 
abuse campaign tuesday 
republicans led by sen pete wilson rcalif proposed the 
measure wednesday it was aimed at transferring to drug treatment 
programs a large sum of money from the account legislators use for 
their mailings 
the senate gave the overall legislative appropriations bill final 
passage on an 819 vote late thursday the measure will have to be 
reconciled with a 16 billion housepassed version 
the senate measure virtually eliminates districtwide mailings 
used often by senators and representatives to keep their names 
before their constituents but allows them to continue answering 
individual queries 
sen david boren dokla told colleagues the bulk of the money 
used for mass mailings is spent by senators seeking to bolster their 
chances for reelection he said that was wrong 
were approaching some 70 million a year on mass mailings to 
the public that have not been solicited figures show a much 
higher percentage of the mass mailings are by those who are up for 
reelection he said 
sen ted stevens ralaska led the opposition saying 
massmailed newsletters were indispensable tools of communication 
with his constituents 
but wilson said this is an opportunity for congress to do 
something about something we have talked about he said so 
lets begin to break the habit and lets begin to help those who 
need help 
also voting against the amendment were sens bill bradley 
dnj ernest hollings dsc daniel inouye dhawaii joseph 
lieberman dconn spark matsunaga dhawaii daniel patrick 
moynihan dny and paul simon dill 
bradley and simon are the only two of the eight who are up for 
reelection next year nine senators did not vote brock adams 
dwash william armstrong rcolo max baucus dmont conrad 
burns rmont james mcclure ridaho frank murkowski ralaska 
william roth rdel terry sanford dnc and james sasser 
dtenn 
the money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides 
treatment to drugaddicted pregnant women mothers and infants 
focusing on crack wilson said 400000 babies are born annually to 
mothers who use drugs 
without wilsons amendment the legislative spending bill would 
have limited congressional spending on mail next year to 80 
million 48 million for the house which has 435 members and 32 
million for the 100member senate 
the wilson amendment slashes the total for both chambers from 80 
billion to 35 million the bulk of that money would be used to 
cover a shortfall in mailing expenses for the current budget year 
which ends sept 30 leaving little massmailing money for fiscal 
1990 which starts oct 1 
the housepassed bill seeks to allocate 1247 million for all 
congressional mailing privileges in the new budget year

married couples are more likely to 
divorce if the woman has more education than her husband a study 
concludes 
the study found that the divorce rate for marriages in which the 
wife has more schooling than her husband is over 50 percent higher 
than it is for marriages in which the husband has the same or higher 
educational achievement 
apparently many men and women have not been socialized to 
accept the notion of a woman being educationally more accomplished 
than her husband said neil g bennett an associate professor of 
sociology at yale university who led the study 
that women are better able to support themselves and less fearful 
of going it alone could account for the higher rate of divorce 
bennett said 
we might have expected that couples who had very different 
levels of education regardless of which spouse had the higher 
education would have higher divorce rates than average because 
these couples would have different world views and be subject to 
greater conflict and stress in their marriage 
but that was not true we found only couples in which the wife 
was more educated than the husband had higher divorce rates than 
average bennett said in an interview wednesday 
in the united states about half of all marriages today will end 
in divorce 
bennetts study has not been published but the results were 
presented last month at the american sociological association in san 
francisco 
the study was based on data from nearly 3500 married or divorced 
women under age 50 collected by the national survey of families and 
households between march 1987 and may 1988 
bennett received widespread attention three years ago when he 
concluded that single collegeeducated women over age 30 had only a 
20 percent chance of getting married a census bureau researcher 
studying the same statistics disputed his findings and said those 
same women actually have a 66 percent chance of eventually marrying 
bennett has done a new study on the same subject with more recent 
data but the results will not be made public until they are 
published in november 
in looking at divorce rates the yale researchers also examined 
the effects of religious differences on marriages not unexpectedly 
they found that divorce rates are higher for couples in interfaith 
marriages 
when a wife and husband have different religion but both are not 
very religious the divorce rate is not much different from the 
average the study found 
to study the effect of educational differences the women and men 
were placed in four different educational categories those with 
less than a high school education those with a high school 
education those with some college education and those with at least 
a college degree 
bennett emphasized that men and women who marry someone who has a 
substantially different education religous belief or age are 
generally less traditional than those who marry people with similar 
characteristics and may therefore have less conventional views 
about marriage to begin with such factors however cannot be 
measured

sevens whites accused of killing a black 
teenager in the mostly white bensonhurst district will be tried 
before a black judge whose assignment bypassed the usual selection 
process court officials said thursday 
justice thaddeus owens 70 was selected by a panel of judges and 
court administrators last week because of his experience and his 
ability to handle cases receiving a lot of publicity said matthew 
t crosson chief administrator of the state court system 
owens race played no part in the selection crosson said 
owens was named solely because of his judicial excellence court 
of appeals chief judge sol wachtler who oversees court 
administration told the new york post which first reported the 
selection in its thursday editions 
the judge had no comment on his appointment or on the case his 
clerk said 
lawyers for the young white men charged in the aug 23 attack 
greeted the announcement with mixed reactions 
the attorney for the accused shooter said he might file a motion 
to block it david depetris who represents 18yearold joseph fama 
said he objected not because of the judge that was selected but 
because it may violate my clients rights 
fama who is being held without bail in the brooklyn house of 
detention has been charged with murder in the attack and is 
suspected of firing the shots that killed 16yearold yusuf hawkins 
hawkins and three of his friends had gone to the mostly white 
brooklyn neighborhood to look at a used car when they were set upon 
by a gang of some 30 batcarrying whites the police said 
seven young white men who allegedly took part in the attack have 
been arrested and the police say they expect to pick up other 
suspects 
michael l santangelo the lawyer for 21yearold charles 
stressler labeled the selection indiscreet insensitive and 
illegal 
however albert c aronne lawyer for 19yearold joseph serrano 
praised the selection as did mathew j mari the attorney for 
18yearold steven curreri 
ive known thaddeus owens for a number of years and have tried 
a number of cases before him he is a good man and a good judge 
aronne said hes tough and we need someone tough who calls it the 
way he sees it 
judges usually are selected at random or specialize in certain 
types of cases but for trials expected to generate high interest or 
controversy court officials frequently handpick whomever they 
believe most suited to handle the case crosson said

the nonaligned movement ended its 
ninth summit conference early friday after adopting a resolution 
calling for the release of all hostages 
the fourday conference of 102 nations was attended by about 50 
heads of state and a dozen prime ministers it was due to end 
thursday but delays brought on by wrangling between hardliners and 
moderates kept the summit going until after 1 am friday 
the session passed a final declaration and adopted 30 political 
and economic resolutions dealing with topics ranging from 
afghanistan and the middle east to terrorism and drugs trafficking 
many of them were compromise resolutions reflecting the deep 
divisions among members 
the international terrorism resolution was agreed upon by the 
meetings political committee after tough bargaining 
it said the heads of state and government resolutely demanded 
that all hostages and all kidnapped persons be immediately released 
irrespective of the perpetrators and the place of the crime 
the resolution condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated by 
individuals states or groups of states and expressed the movements 
determination to fight such acts with all possible legal means 
both nationally and internationally 
yugoslav spokesman goran milic indicated in a meeting with 
reporters at midnight that the final session was delayed about 5 
hours by disputes 
pleas for pragmatism and cooperation with the industrialized 
world contrasted with strident attacks on the united states several 
delegates denounced zionism in their speeches a topic that 
caused problems to the very end 
chairman yasser arafat of the palestine liberation organization 
insisted that in addition to the final documents stressing the 
struggle against imperialism colonialism neocolonialism racism 
and apartheid it should also condemn zionism and its 
practices 
heated arguments with moderates followed with arafat drawing 
support from such hardliners as bangladesh yemen and cuba a 
compromise was reached on including the zionism reference in one 
of the many political resolutions sources told the associated 
press speaking on condition of anonymity 
nicaragua in a bid to gain international prestige sought to get 
the summit to agree to hold its next summit there but no agreement 
was reached conference sources said 
delegates did agree however that ghana would be the site for a 
nonaligned foreign ministers conference to be held in 1991 in 
preparation of the 10th nonaligned summit 
moderates have emerged as the big majority and resisted 
throughout the summit attempts by radical nations to introduce cold 
war rhetoric 
yugoslav president janez drnovsek told the closing session we 
have achieved a high degree of unity about what the future of our 
movement should be

the 25yearold sailor accused of causing the 
uss iowa explosion that killed 47 soliders grew up as a seventh day 
adventist and is remembered as a religious and devoted student 
the navy released a report thursday that said gunners mate 
clayton hartwig most likely caused the april 19 explosion that 
ranks as the worst us naval disaster since the viet nam war 
hartwig attended lakewood seventh day adventist elementary school 
and graduated from mount vernon academy a seventh day adventist 
school in mount vernon ohio 
seventh day adventists are vegetarians who neither smoke nor 
drink alcohol and coffee they attend church on saturday and believe 
in the second coming of jesus christ 
harvey allison maintenance director at of the coeducational 
school of 140 students about 40 miles northeast of columbus said 
hartwig worked for him part of the day doing manual tasks and 
supervising students and went to classes the other half of the day 
he was religious and a devoted worker allison said thursday 
whatever task he did he did it efficiently he got good grades 
allison said he did not believe the navys report they got a 
scapegoat they have to blame it on someone and he is not here to 
defend himself allison said 
while attending the academy hartwig enjoyed camping and the 
outdoors but his heart was set on joining the navy allison said 
he went straight into the navy after graduation because it 
was his love he came back once a year to see the students 
allison said 
hartwigs sister kathleen kubicina said seventh day adventists 
do not believe in violence or the firing of guns but the family 
allowed hartwig to join the service because he had a great desire to 
do so 
ms kubicina said hartwig had a girlfriend charlene meter and 
he wrote her a number of letters while he was aboard the iowa 
copies of 11 letters written by hartwig were provided to the 
associated press by ms kubicina ten were written to ms meter and 
one was written to his parents 
for the last 6 yrs all ive known is the navy wrote clayton 
in a nov 8 letter im military through and through and at times 
its hard for me to get along with civilians 
i guess its like this i have no idea what goes on in your 
life in college your problems from day to day your frustrations 
the people you cant stand what you do its the same for you with 
me theres no way you could understand what its like to live in a 
cramped ship and be at sea for months at a time he wrote 
following the explosion at the request of the navy the fbi 
center for anaylysis of violent crimes conducted a psychiatric study 
and found that hartwig was disturbed and under a lot of stress 
virtually insuring some type of reaction in this instance it is 
suicide 
hartwig and gunners mate kendall truitt 21 each bought 50000 
life insurance policies from the navy credit union just before the 
iowa left for the persian gulf in 1987 
truitt since has married and has denied suggestions he was 
involved in a homosexual relationship with hartwig 
hartwigs family rejects the enquirys conclusion and is calling 
for a congressional investigation into the navys handling of the 
iowa probe

spouse defense against charges she killed her lesbian lover was 
convicted thursday of seconddegree murder 
annette green 30 was found guilty by a jury in the oct 30 
1988 shooting death of her 11year lover ivonne julio 
the jury found that ms greens shooting of ms julio 32 was 
not premeditated and decided on the lesser charge prosecutors had 
sought a firstdegree murder conviction which could bring the death 
penalty 
the twoweek trial was reportedly the first time a lesbian had 
tried the battered spouse defense which some women have 
successfully used after slaying an abusive husband or lover 
ms green faces a 12 to 17year prison term palm beach circuit 
judge tom waddell ordered a presentencing investigation but set no 
sentencing date 
defense attorney william lasley said in his closing argument 
earlier thursday that ms julio beat and tormented ms green for 
years 
lasley made no statement after the verdict and gave no immediate 
indication whether he would appeal the ruling 
assistant state attorney robert johnson told reporters afterwards 
that he felt the case did not support use of the battered spouse 
syndrome 
on tuesday wadell ruled to allow the battered spouse defense in 
the case the judge said the type of relationship made no difference 
ms green testified in her own defense during the trial saying 
she never wanted to do anything to ms julio 
i was just trying to defend myself she said 
ms green also testified that after she shot ms julio following 
an argument she then held the gun to her own head 
i was going to kill myself because i loved her she said

quaker oats co has duped consumers by 
claiming its oatmeal can help reduce the risk of heart disease the 
texas attorney generals office said thursday in suing the nations 
biggest seller of hot cereal 
we are in the middle of an oat bran craze in this country that 
was primarily started and prompted by quaker in order to sell its 
products attorney general jim mattox said at a news conference 
consumers have been duped quakers claims are largely not 
true he said 
spokesmen for chicagobased quaker oats defended the 
advertisements saying they feel the advertising is truthful and is 
supported by scientific evidence 
we expect to prevail in this litigation said luther c 
mckinney senior vice president of law and corporate affairs for 
quaker oats 
in the lawsuit filed on behalf of the texas department of health 
in a dallas state district court the state said quaker oats ads as 
replete with exaggerations halftruths and misinformation 
one of those ads reads studies say that just two ounces of 
quaker oats a day along with a lowfat lowcholesterol diet can 
help lower your cholesterol almost 10 percent other studies say 
thats enough to reduce your risk of heart attack by nearly 20 
percent 
the state claims quakers own tests showed that only a 3 percent 
reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a 
lowfat lowcholesterol diet and that reduction applied only to 
women if they ate 25 percent more oatmeal than quaker recommends as 
a regular serving mattox said 
mattox said quaker oats has a good product but its only 
cereal its not a heartattack preventative 
ron vottrell a spokesman for quaker oats said the ad was 
cleared by the federal trade commission which reviewed it after 
complaints were lodged by the center for science in the public 
interest a washington consumer rights group 
the texas lawsuit filed under the texas deceptive trade 
practicesconsumer protection act asks the court to prohibit the 
company from continuing its allegedly misleading ads and seeks 
10000 in civil penalties and additional court and investigative 
costs 
assistant attorney general stephen gardner who is prosecuting 
the case said the lawsuit is part of an ongoing examination of food 
manufacturers health claims 
quaker was not so much jumping on the healthclaims bandwagon 
as being the horse that was pulling it we wanted to look first at 
the companies that were responsible for creating a series of 
outrageous claims about what their product can do for your health 
he said 
mattox has recently taken on other giant food companies such as 
campbell soup co sara lee corp and carnation co saying they 
have engaged in false advertising the companies all deny the claims

the energy department said thursday it will put 
one of the two plants producing uranium fuel for naval reactors on 
standby because less fuel is needed nowadays 
the plant being mothballed is at the savannah river site in south 
carolina where some 600 afffected employees will be absorbed into 
other projects 
the only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drive 
nuclear powered warships is operated by nuclear fuel services inc 
at erwin tenn the department said the erwin plant could supply the 
navys entire needs 
the projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the cost of 
operating two facilities the department said in a statement 
several reasons were given for reduced demand among them 
reactor core design and manufacturing are getting better 
permitting cores to last longer and reducing the need for refueling 
and reducing the amount of fuel needed for a core in the first place 
the navy has reduced its projected building plans for 
nuclearpowered warships

witness in the slaying of a us drug agent

he told a federal grand jury in los angeles that he did not know two 
alleged mexican drug figures charged in the killing of dea agent 
enrique camarena 
in his grand jury testimony he apparently denied knowing rafael 
caro quintero and ernesto fonseca carrillo 
zuno a prominent mexican businessman was arrested aug 9 in san

rebels and government said they agreed in principle to meet soon in 
mexico to try to end their civil war 
the farabundo marti national liberation front said it would 
suspend all acts of sabotage in el salvador as of sunday and asked 
the rightist government to respond in kind to create a serious 
climate for peace negotiations 
the marxistled rebel coalition announced no time or date for the 
talks and said differences over a mediator still clouded prospects 
for a dialogue 
salvadoran president alfredo cristiani called the announcement 
encouraging and suggested the first meeting be held in mexico sept

salvadoran peace talks in two years 
president cristiani called for dialogue in his inaugural 
address and we believe it is time for the fmln to realize that 
democracy and violence do not mix she said

shown in reaffirming continued us aid to el salvador and for 
observance of human rights standards 
fmln leaders told a news conference in mexico city that rebel 
fighters will stop sabotaging telephone and electrical facilities 
and stop planting land mines and booby traps at midnight sunday

sufficiently prudent time for the armed forces and the government to 
take corresponding steps that will contribute to creating a serious 
climate for negotiation said a rebel communique read to the 
reporters 
the leaders would not say what constitutes sufficiently 
prudent 
the communique accused the government and its armed forces of 
bombing civilian areas using mines and booby traps arresting and 
torturing students workers and other activists and attacking 
journalists 
it said this must stop and the government must suspend the draft 
and must allow the immediate unrestricted return of all refugees 
the communique said a positive government response would 
demonstrate a real will for peace 
no immediate response came from the government 
the fmln has fought a series of usbacked salvadoran

lunchtime at mulates the friendly waitress 
serves up fried catfish stuffed peppers and jambalaya to the 
tourist while the fiddle and accordion wail another chorus of 
jolie blonde 
it may make the tourist commission here in the heart of acadiana 
happy but it has trent angers hotter than a cayenne pepper 
thats exactly how a lot of people got their image of cajuns a 
reporter comes to town and he is sent to mulates and on a swamp tour 
and then he heads off to write his story most people think were a 
bunch of laidback drunken hedonists who eat too much and dance all 
night 
fun food and music may be part of the cajun heritage but its 
not the whole story said angers author of the truth about 
cajuns 
that doesnt define who we are cajuns are a people with a 
strong work ethic strong family ties and a fidelity to the land 
in his book angers traces the history of the french exiles who 
moved from nova scotia in the mid1700s and whose descendants kept 
many of their native customs including the language and became 
known as acadians or cajuns 
angers 41 whose mother is cajun blames the media tourism 
counterfeit cajun products and humorist justin wilson whose cajun 
chef cooking show is nationally syndicated for the cajun 
stereotype 
he speaks in broken english and with a lot of malaprops to 
hear him youd think all cajuns are barely literate and not very 
bright he is not a cajun but this is the only image of a live 
cajun many people have 
his contrived accent and the demeaning nature of many of his 
jokes are embarrassing to many people in south louisiana they just 
wish mr wilson would go home and do his cooking instead of 
ridiculing them 
wilson and his managerwife jeannine refused to even discuss the 
issue i dont want to talk about that wilson said 
paul edward joubert a cajun and a sociologist at the university 
of southwestern louisiana said angers book makes some valid points 
to see some of it you would think we all have pirogues still 
and are barefoot and are living in a swamp theres the implication 
that these people dont know any better but theyre happy because 
they dance a lot he said 
working from national publications angers compiled a list of 
stereotypes for example 
what lives in the swamps plays an accordion eats crawfish 
speaks french and rocks your socks off 
in these parts if you dont dance and drink beer people 
think youre a communist 
cajun country is a land of fiddles and etouffee squeeze 
boxes and twosteps where everybodys a cousin and everythings 
cooked in cayenne by a people whose religion is hospitality 
alice ferguson a spokeswoman for the lafayette parish convention 
and visitors commission denied tourism officials have helped to 
generate such stereotypes when a writer or film crew comes in 
they sometimes only want to see a swamp or cajun dancing or one part 
of the culture she said 
we try to make sure they get what they want if they dont have 
a specific request we try to show them some of everything the 
museums the city the university as well as the swamp and the 
dancing 
even cajun food has been slandered angers said accusing 
national writers and cooks for erroneously labeling it hot and 
peppery to read about cajun food or taste socalled cajun food 
like cajun potato chips or cajun whalers at burger king or the 
cajun pizza at pizza hut youd think cajuns had to drink a lot of 
beer just to preserve their taste buds cajun food is about the only 
thing that has been more maligned here than the people 
his definition of cajun food is good home cooking made with fresh 
ingredients and skill some may be spicy but its not hot or 
peppery 
while cajuns have managed to maintain a cultural identity they 
are not a group of simple people living in the past angers said 
it may be good for tourism but it undermines the dignity of the 
cajun people 
and it is good for tourism although ferguson has no figures on 
how many people visit the area annually she said the four major 
festivals in lafayette each draw 200000 to 300000 people 
although 8 percent to 10 percent of the cajuns still hunt trap 
and live in the swamps angers said the majority are mainstream 
americans these days 
because of the fact were projected as goodtime charlies 
people who are in a position to bring industry into this state dont 
even give this area a thought they assume we are so busy playing 
that we dont ever work 
angers who also is the editor and publisher of the magazine 
acadiana profile said i dont want to go overboard in the other 
direction and make cajuns seem like boring humorless people who 
never have fun but come on you couldnt do to another minority 
what people have done to cajuns and get away with it 
all im saying is there is more to us than a group of 
dullwitted beer drinking musicians lets have a little balance 
from now on

the green man is back staring at travelers from 
posters in london subway stations 
the mysterious and arresting image of a face with sprouting 
leaves is older than christianity harking back to pagan times when 
the earth the sun and all living things were believed to have 
spirits 
there have been many types of green man this one was carved in 
the 14th or 15th century in the ceiling of norwich cathedral 115 
miles northeast of london 
he is on a poster for an exhibition called out of the wood the 
tree as image and symbol about the relationship between trees and 
the arts it features mainly contemporary wood carvings and 
ornaments and ceramics based on the shapes of trees and leaves and 
poems about trees 
it was an inspired choice to put the green man on the poster 
because we have had a steady stream of visitors all day since we 
opened on aug 2 said julia bennett who helps run the exhibition 
in the crafts council gallery in waterloo place near piccadilly 
circus 
susan clifford a former landscape planner also involved with the 
exhibition said in an interview the green man seems to have had 
a lot of uses before he was taken over by christians and then 
discarded in his simplest version he was the spirit of 
regeneration the spirit of the forest he was a giant garlanded in 
green sometimes frightening sometimes benign 
william anderson a writer and poet and author of a forthcoming 
book on the green man said the figure can be seen in medieval 
churches and cathedrals throughout europe at times these days he 
can be seen in england as a pub sign 
but his origins are much more ancient than the middle ages he 
is one of those symbols that appear and disappear in history the 
writer said 
the green man may be the origin of a folk cult figure known as 
jack in the green or robin of the wood and it was robin who may 
have inspired the legend of robin hood and his merry men in sherwood 
forest 
the gallery is a showplace for contemporary arts and crafts but 
hardly a tourist attraction and doesnt usually get many visitors on 
hot days 
but we had tv and radio interviews and good notices in the 
papers because the green man is so striking bennett said 
the version of the poster green man is based on the drawing still 
high up in the cathedral but the exhibition offers a modern green 
man made of gently flickering neon tubes by peter freeman 
the idea of a visible spirit of the trees is repeated in other 
exhibits gold jacket by richard wincer priced at 3100 is a 
dark coat covered with real oak leaves that were preserved with 
resin and painted gold 
i thought of oak leaves because i wanted to do something very 
english said wincer 
oak forests dotted england centuries ago and provided the timber 
for homes farms and ships

pino daniele grew up steeped in traditional 
neapolitan music the sometimes mournful sometimes joyous melodies 
passed down for centuries in this mediterranean city 
but it didnt stop him from wanting to be elvis 
i loved rock n roll but i also loved my music neapolitan 
says the 34yearold singer i am a big fan of elvis presley and 
at the same time im a big fan of neapolitan crooner roberto 
murolo 
today daniele is leading a revival of the neapolitan song which 
made italian music worldfamous with such tunes as o sole mio 
funiculi funicula and turna a surriento return to 
sorrento 
but instead of mandolins it is electric guitars and a rock or 
jazz rhythm that mark the new neapolitan sound 
danieles albums have won him huge audiences and encouraged a 
whole school of neapolitan singers at a time when italian performers 
account for less than half the record sales in italy while american 
and british singers dominate the pop charts 
neapolitan song represents one of the main points of italian 
culture we members of the new generation said lets create a 
fusion explained daniele in an interview at his studio in 
formia 50 miles from naples 
that is we fuse it neapolitan song with modern music a 
universal language which could be jazz or rock or other kinds of 
music 
with a faded tshirt covering his husky frame his graystreaked 
black hair pulled back in a ponytail there is no mistaking daniele 
for enrico caruso but he does claim a number of other similarities 
with his neapolitan predecessors 
like them daniele sings about the sea the sultry mediterranean 
afternoons the plight of the citys poor he places special 
emphasis on melody like past neapolitans whose songs are still 
played in italian restaurants the world over 
and he uses the local dialect which is laced with french and 
spanish from naples colonial past and english from the american 
soldiers based in the area since world war ii 
in danieles songs the tradition is mixed with a rock or 
afrocuban beat something that startled people when he first began 
playing it in the mid1970s 
it was something new but it communicated emotion said the 
musician this is the important thing in the end 
indeed crowds frequently join in an emotional chorus with 
daniele particularly for his older ballads such as napule e 
naples is and terra mia my land about the corruption 
and neglect that have scarred naples 
his success has helped fuel a boom in neapolitan pop music 
featuring singers edoardo bennato teresa de sio and tony esposito 
a neapolitan massimo ranieri won the italian national song contest 
san remo last year with a new neapolitan ballad perdere 
lamore losing love 
danieles songs aim to bring together not only italian and 
american music but the experience of the poor in the two countries 
theyre neapolitan melodies but with the rhythm of american 
blacks explains gianni borgna author of history of italian 
song 
daniele suggests the poor of naples are a bit like american 
blacks not so different from outcasts in america 
the modern tunes are a long way from traditional neapolitan song 
which was influenced by arias in donizetti and rossini operas as 
well as french and spanish traditions 
daniele heard those songs while growing up as one of six children 
of a naples port worker as he taught himself to play the guitar in 
his teens he also followed singers such as peppino di capri who 
were beginning to adapt neapolitan melodies to a nightclub style 
in recent years daniele has increasingly worked with american 
and latin american musicians to experiment with other influences and 
establish broader appeal for his music 
we are trying to develop this to get into the international 
market which is very difficult he said if you dont sing in 
english youre out automatically 
he hopes nonetheless to win broader success with a 
mediterranean sound featuring neapolitan melody latin and 
blues rhythms and perhaps an english singer 
while he is not an international superstar his reputation has 
spread in europe he has given concerts in france england the 
netherlands austria and cuba 
in january he will head for the united states for a concert 
series called night of the guitar in which he will play 
instrumentals with guitarists including leslie west of mountain and 
robby krieger of the doors 
daniele says with the international contacts his songs have 
developed a more modern sound but they always have a reference to 
the neapolitan way of communicating he insisted theres always 
that

american narcotics agents trained in 
tropical combat and armed with automatic weapons are preparing to 
move into a heavily fortified police garrison built with us funds 
in the heart of perus cocarich jungle 
the base at santa lucia 65 miles northwest of here is part of a 
major offensive by the peruvian government against drug gangs and 
their allies dogmatic maoist guerrillas who call themselves the 
shining path and control much of the lush upper huallaga river 
valley on the eastern slopes of the andes 
despite the danger posed by the guerrilla force the united 
states is making the campaign in peru the centerpiece of its drive 
against cocaine trafficking in the andean nations which supply the 
coca leaf from which the drug is refined the plans were drawn 
before president bush outlined his 79billion drug program sept 5 
sixty to 70 percent of the worlds coca production comes out of 
here said craig chretien chief of the us drug enforcement 
agencys operations in peru peru of all the countries offers 
the best opportunity to do significant damage to the coca trade 
once the antidrug base is completed in october as many as 50 
americans will operate directly from the upper huallaga region 
providing training and air support to some 300 police rangers 
assigned to the garrison 
the americans include dea agents and contracted vietnam war 
veterans who fly and maintain the nine us bell helicopters and two 
c123 cargo planes currently on loan to peru for the antidrug fight 
the base is strategically located near all of the most 
important trafficking areas said gen juan zarate chief of 
perus drug police 
the compound will have a threequartermile airstrip that can 
accommodate c130 cargo planes three helicopter pads and nine 
buildings mainly barracks the 100acre area will be enclosed by 
barbed wire and the outlying perimeter will be protected by mines 
the stepup in the us involvement comes as the peruvian army 
armed with recently acquired soviet armored helicopters has 
launched its heaviest campaign so far in the valley against the 
shining path sendero luminoso in spanish 
the escalation in the fighting in the valley however has 
aroused the concern of the andean commission of jurists among 
others that the united states could be drawn into the war against 
the guerrillas 
the commission affliated with the andean pact alliance of 
venezuela colombia ecuador peru and bolivia noted recently that 
while the base is intended for the drug fight observers are 
concerned that in the medium term it can be converted into a 
springboard for the internationalization of the counterinsurgency 
fight in peru 
the dea agents came to tingo maria about 250 miles northeast of 
lima perus capital in search of cocaine traffickers but they 
have found themselves in the middle of a revolution and working in a 
valley dominated by at least 2500 guerrillas 
its probably the most hostile situation the dea works in 
anywhere chretien said in an interview in lima 
earlier this year the shining path offered a 50000 reward for 
any dea agent killed in the valley according to the rev paul 
feeley a canadian roman catholic priest working in aucayacu a town 
35 miles north of tingo maria 
the dea has become a dirty word in the huallaga valley he 
said sendero and most other people around here too see the dea 
as being antisubversive not just antidrug 
in return for providing protection from police raids the shining 
path enjoys the support of tens of thousands of peasants who grow 
coca in the valley earning 10 times what they could from other 
crops 
the guerrillas collect a 10 to 15 percent tax from the 
growers as well as charging colombian traffickers 10000 to 15000 
for each small plane that picks up cocaine paste for refining in 
colombia according to the peasants and police 
houses along the jungle highway leading out of tingo maria the 
largest town in the valley are scrawled in bloodred paint with 
deadly messages for the dea 
one on a school building said get out yankees while you can 
you will find your tombs here 
the dea is not permitted to take part in counterinsurgency wars 
but in practice that changed in peru when it became clear two years 
ago that the guerrillas were actively involved in the cocaine trade 
the rule is that sendero is fair game if theyre trafficking in 
drugs chretien said what counts is if theyre traffickers not 
their politics that doesnt mean we go looking for guerrilla camps 
or columns but if we spot them from the air we notify the police 
and if they attack us we defend ourselves 
the dea pulled out of this ramshackle settlement in a hurry in 
april after a force of 200 rebels aided by local drug gangs and 
colombian traffickers overran a police post in uchiza a town a few 
miles from santa lucia killing 10 policemen three of them were 
officers who were executed publicly in the town plaza after the 
garrison ran out of ammunition 
tingo maria isnt a healthy place if youre an american said 
a dea agent theres a sendero committee on every block every 
block 
tingo maria at the southern end of the narrow 150milelong 
valley has the look of a town expecting an attack at any moment 
nervous troops behind sandbag barricades guard the bridge over the 
river to the towns airstrip 
villagers say the shining path now moves boldly through the 
valley in columns of up to 500 fighters the rebels wear uniforms 
of black tshirts and khaki pants forsaking the clothing of the 
peruvian peasantry that would allow them to fade into the civilian 
populace 
in response the army has begun employing its soviet helicopters 
known as flying tanks and armed with heavycaliber machine guns 
and rockets in july the armed forces reported killing 210 rebels 
110 of them in three air and land battles over a twoday period in 
the valley 
its getting to the point where there are going to be 
fullscale battles between two strong forces said feeley the 
canadian priest 
making use recently of four of the mi25 helicopters the army 
strafed guerrilla columns and at least one village of peasants 
considered to be shining path supporters 
human rights groups fear that the casualty tolls provided by the 
army may include many civilians 
feeley said that 17 suspected shining path leaders detained by 
the army in late july in aucayacu are now on that long list of 
disappeared people 
but the guerrillas have taken their own toll 
in june three shining path assassins walked into the office of 
tingo marias popular mayor manuel espinosa and shot him to death 
as he sat behind his desk 
in aucayacu the shining path has assassinated four of the last 
six mayors 
the other two quit before they were killed said feeley

the maoist shining path guerrillas who 
dominate perus upper huallaga river valley have brought their own 
law and order to a cocainecorrupted violenceridden region 
with a system they call revolutionary justice they have 
banned drug abuse prostitution homosexuality and thievery from the 
villages they control 
two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held 
up but the companeros put an end to that said cab driver david 
nicolas referring to the guerrillas by the spanish term for 
comrades they killed a few bandits and the rest got the message 
much of the appeal of the rebels is rooted in their reputation 
for almost puritanical honesty 
shopkeepers say the guerrillas never fail to pay for the food and 
supplies they acquire in the villages the same shopkeepers complain 
bitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever 
offering to pay 
in a rare conversation with reporters a shining path political 
officer who spoke only on condition he not be identified gave an 
example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down do not 
steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow 
in a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are 
respected the shining path is setting down clear rules and making 
them stick 
in a sense they enforce a hyperchristian morality except 
they kill you if you break the rules said the rev paul feeley a 
canadian roman catholic priest working in aucayacu 255 miles 
northeast of lima 
in late july four young homosexual men who rendezvoused at a 
bridge a few miles outside tingo maria 35 miles south of here were 
set upon and killed by the rebels their bodies were dumped into the 
river 
a few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near tingo 
maria for smoking cigarettes laced with semirefined cocaine 
people have had to discipline themselves said raul aranda 
an agronomist in tingo maria explaining the effects of 
revolutionary justice in rural areas a man must be faithful 
to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week 
violators are warned only once 
villagers say they are told the revolution has a thousand eyes 
and a thousand ears 
perus elected officials have painted the shining path insurgents 
as lunatic killers in the bleak andean highlands where the rebels 
launched their insurgency in may 1980 they have slain thousands of 
peasants in attacks on villages they viewed as traitors to the rebel 
cause 
but here in the junglecloaked upper huallaga valley the worlds 
largest source of coca leaf the shining path sendero luminoso 
in spanish enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers 
because the rebels protect them against a usfunded coca 
eradication program 
although they prohibit drug consumption the guerrillas defend 
coca production as an important source of income for the peasants 
their only condition is that the semirefined coca paste be sent out 
of peru 
the rebels charge coca farmers a tax of 10 to 15 percent on 
the earnings from the sale of their crops to drug traffickers who 
process the leaf into paste and sell it to colombian cocaine 
dealers the colombians arrive in small planes at dozens of 
clandestine airstrips throughout the 150milelong valley 
people in the upper huallaga appear to accept shining paths 
social order they say they feel protected from the violence of drug 
gangs corrupt local officials and abusive police 
why do you think people have joined the shining path for the 
coca and for revenge said carlos ferrer a taxi driver who 
travels the road between tingo maria and aucayacu when the 
government began trying to wipe out coca police came and mistreated 
people they robbed peasants they raped their women 
that view of the police as corrupt and abusive of their power is 
widely held in the valley even top government officials in lima say 
there is much truth to the complaints 
a cop in the huallaga valley expects to be bribed said a 
senior interior ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity he figures its a right coming to him he gets off the 
plane from lima with his hand out for a payoff 
official corruption is a problem throughout peru but in the 
huallaga valley it seems rampant 
a half dozen peasants complained in separate interviews that to 
obtain a farm loan from the local banco agrario they have to kick 
back 25 percent of the loan to bank officials 
what ive heard is that if you want to be named a teacher in 
the valley said feeley its three months salary as payment 
and if youre a woman also the bed 
the shining path has been quick to kill local officials they 
deemed to be corrupt according to residents of the valley 
if the shining path has the image of an organization thats 
fighting corruption in a very corrupt place thats going to win 
them some points feeley said 
a lawyer in tingo maria said his caseload had dropped off 
dramatically because peasants no longer come into town to seek 
justice 
formal justice here is ineffective corrupt and time 
consuming he said the shining paths justice is quick free 
and very effective

tom pickens makes no attempt to conceal hes the 
son of a wellknown takeover strategist on one wall of his office 
hangs a caricature of his father in pursuit of phillips petroleum co 
but said the youngest son of t boone pickens jr i always had 
a real independent streak 
pickens 32 is chairman of catalyst energy corp a new 
yorkbased power producer he bought in august 1988 using his own 
money and capital from a canadian company great lakes group 
pickens said he did not ask his father who heads the mesa 
limited partnership oil concern in texas to contribute toward the 
purchase 
he did not need boone pickens money or his reputation by the 
time he bought catalyst tom pickens already had founded and sold a 
business and tried his hand at other investments including hostile 
takeover attempts like those his father has become famous for 
the younger pickens his full name is thomas boone pickens iii 
began trading a stock portfolio when he was 14 in his senior year 
at southern methodist university he started a company that 
distributed computer components 
the companys sales went from zero to 10 million in about 2 
years before he sold it and then pickens went into what he called 
small venture capitaltype companies 
but about 1985 pickens said he found that business had become 
pretty risky and a very difficult way to build a portfolio of 
operating companies he sought a more stable operation something 
he believed catalyst would be 
catalyst was attractive pickens said because independent 
power is on the leading edge of the energy business and i look for 
consistent forms of cash flow which it can bring 
pickens said he expects to expand the privately held company 
which has 1 billion in assets and annual sales of 460 million 
through acquisitions 
the firms projects include a 500 million floating power plant 
the merrimac recently towed up the mississippi to be part of a 
hyroelectric project that catalyst partly owns 
in 1987 pickens made his first hostile takeover attempt when a 
group he led bid for japan fund inc a mutual fund that escaped the 
advance 
pickens group later made a 106 million offer for the richmond 
hill savings bank in new york city but sold its stake in the bank 
when a higher bidder emerged the group also made a run at another 
mutual fund clemente global growth fund but was stymied when a 
federal judge blocked the offer 
pickens said he looks for whatevers the cheapest way to 
acquire a corporation whatevers the most efficient form 
under the right circumstances that can mean a tender offer or a 
direct appeal to shareholders for their stock regardless of what 
the companys management wants 
tender offers made tom pickens father unwelcome in the 
boardrooms of major us oil companies besides phillips boone 
pickens pursued unocal corp gulf corp and a number of smaller 
firms 
although he never succeeded in taking one over the elder pickens 
profited handsomely from his attempts and embodied the emergence of 
the corporate raider as both a feared and admired symbol of business 
power in the 1980s 
learning about business and investment was a natural part of 
growing up in boone pickens home 
it was always around said tom pickens whose blond 
blueeyed boyish looks make him appear much younger than 32 
he held jobs typical for a teenager in high school and college 
working in a photo lab and liquor store and operating a forklift for 
international paper and in the process got training on how a 
manager should treat employees 
i worked for a lot of jerks he said i know what kind of 
special talent it is to be a jerk having worked for those guys and 
i also know the way around it 
i know the way that i would like to be treated in order to give 
100 percent and that is how i treat my people he said 
pickens worked briefly for mesa including a stint in the north 
sea after he graduated high school but joining the company 
fulltime was never an option 
dads really big on the whole idea of efficient management 
professional management he said i didnt really realize that a 
lot of public companies hire the siblings or hire the sons and 
daughters of managers i was always under the impression that 
that was not acceptable 
a career at mesa was also out of the question because i didnt 
like the feeling of it going in there and being daddys boy 
pickens said if i messed up i wanted somebody to tell me just 
like they would tell everyone else i wasnt getting honest 
opinions 
his independence also led him along his own career path but it 
has not stopped him from doing business with his father pickens 
also chairs the new york chapter of his fathers advocacy group 
united shareholders association 
he acknowledged there are similarities between his outlook and 
his fathers any time that you have a relationship like the one 
that my father and i have shared throughout the years i think that 
theres going to be a certain amount of sharing of attitudes as 
well 
he said their management styles differ in some ways but i have 
a great deal of respect for the time and the effort and the 
consideration that he has spent on mesa and its employees 
he motivates them very well and he compensates them very well 
and he makes sure they are part of a very closeknit family he 
said 
pickens has similar goals for his 800 employees at catalyst 
were trying to be sure that the people here are very proud to 
be in the position theyre in he said

john henry sununu sees his job as white house 
chief of staff as something more than oval office doorkeeper but 
something not as hectic as say being chief executive of new 
hamsphire 
theres less pressure to work with each and every department 
and agency sununu says here a lot is rightly or wrongly 
under the control of the bureaucrats 
sununus approach to the job differs from those of his 
predecessors under ronald reagan james a baker iii for example 
called it a great big catchers mitt to donald t regan it was 
a shovel brigade that follows a parade down main street 
but sununu 50 the abrasive threeterm new hampshire governor 
who was one of george bushs earliest campaign workers may still be 
one of the surprise acts of the bush white house 
originally an outsider to washington politics sununu eight 
months into the bush presidency is not only proving himself adept at 
survival but has been winning allies in an institution where critics 
originally thought he would make only enemies congress 
ive tried very hard to make every day a learning day sununu 
said in an interview 
after an admittedly rocky start that included the failed 
nomination of john g tower for defense secretary sununu says he 
has been working hard to keep lines of communication open with 
members of congress and with the bureaucracy and in keeping his 
fabled temper in check 
and were there mistakes to learn from lots and im not going 
to tell you any of them 
sununu one of the first aides bush sees each morning at the 
white house and the last one he meets with at the end of each day 
says one of his principal jobs is just to make sure that everybody 
that the president should see gets a chance to see him 
blunt and quickwitted he is a member of the highiq society 
mensa sununu handles the no 1 staff job differently than the 
three men who held it before him 
he is less of a behindthescenes negotiator and conciliator than 
were either james baker reagans first staff chief and now the 
secretary of state or former senate republican leader howard baker 
reagans third staff chief 
where james baker has been credited with moderating some of 
reagans more conservative views sununu is the inhouse 
conservative in the bush white house 
sununu has been criticized by some for maintaining too high a 
profile compared to the lowkey and generally softspoken baker 
but while he exercises firm control over the staff sununu does 
not exert the iron discipline that reagans middle chief of staff 
donald t regan did nor does he attempt to maintain the same 
degree of control over the presidents personal schedule according 
to white house insiders 
some white house staffers have privately criticized sununu for 
appearing at bushs side so often still sununu said i can 
wander in to any meeting any time he bush wants it that way 
stuart eizenstat a former senior aide to president jimmy carter 
and now a washington lawyer and consultant says sununu seems to 
have subdued his own personal agenda for the presidents agenda and 
seems to have achieved a sense of teamwork 
tom griscom a former aide in the reagan white house which was 
rife with staff clashes said sununu has exceeded expectations 
there are still many tests out there but so far people have to 
acknowledge that gov sununu knows his way around more than people 
gave him credit for 
while sununu made an early peace with senate republican leader 
bob dole something donald regan was unable to do in an effort 
salve bitterness remaining from the 1988 presidential primaries he 
hasnt completely retired the hatchet he wielded for bush during the 
presidential campaign 
a favorite target has been sen joe biden ddel chairman of 
the senate judiciary committee which earlier this month dumped 
bushs nomination of william lucas to head the justice departments 
civil rights division 
sen biden is out there to be blunt about it trashing the 
president sununu says 
but the chief of staff also has another role one not often seen 
by the public that of white house jester 
when bush stepped away from an oval office meeting briefly 
sununu impishly had a white house photographer snap a picture of the 
empty presidential chair as he and other top aides looked on 
intently 
sununu and national security adviser brent scowcroft then 
presented an autographed enlargement to bush 
it was inscribed to president skippy from a staff who can 
see through you a clear reference to cartoonist gb trudeaus 
longrunning doonesbury depiction of him as an invisible leader 
with a fictitious evil twin brother skippy 
it was in the middle of a tough week sununu said 
people feel comfortable doing something that breaks the tension 
a little bit i think it allows for a decision to be made in a much 
more relaxed climate and you usually end up with better decisions 
then there was the time he talked budget director richard darman 
into donning a gorilla suit to greet the president or when the 
staff turned the tables and all showed up at a meeting wearing black 
arm bands to mark sununus 50th birthday 
the bespectacled roundfaced aide staff chief claims hes gotten 
a bad rap in the image department that the perception of him as 
arrogant imperious and aggressive is all wrong 
what a lot of people miss was that i was governor in a 
state in which constitutionally and statutorily the governors 
office was relatively weak 
running new hampshire he said was in some ways much harder than 
running the white house staff the pace down here is not as 
hectic he said 
what sununu lacked in legal authority in new hampshire he made 
up for in swagger and bravado then he brought the same 
aggressiveness to managing bushs comefrombehind victory in the 
1988 new hampshire primary and to his travels around the country 
trashing neighboring gov michael dukakis 
that was before his kinder and gentler days bush said the 
other day in kennebunkport maine in discussing his chief of staff 
bush said sununu has my full unequivocal confidence and it 
makes life a lot easier for me hes made a lot of friends for 
our administration on the basis of competence sheer competence 
still while staff morale seems generally high there have been 
some clashes even in this kinder and gentler white house 
including friction between sununu and scowcroft whenever the chief 
of staff wanders into the foreignpolicy domain according to white 
house sources 
and while staff members say that sununu exhibits a sense of 
humor he is not one to cross 
as andrew h card jr a key sununu deputy and former 
massachusetts legislator puts it he expects people to have done 
their homework

when congress decided that there should be a 
drug czar the democrats may not have bargained on getting czar 
bennett after the war on drugs william j bennett could be a 
formidable figure in the political wars of the 1990s 
bennett now 46 will come away from his current assignment as 
one of the most visible figures in the republican lineup his ample 
ambitions are directed at government service as he demonstrated by 
volunteering for the drug job after a brief lucrative season away 
from the federal payroll 
this might have been a milliondollar year for bennett as a 
writer and speechmaker he was heading in that direction at 14000 
a speech plus book advances as director of the office of national 
drug control policy he makes 99500 
and as he once observed the hours are bad the subject 
depressing 
add the fact that theres anything but a guarantee of success 
critics are saying president bushs drug strategy is old stuff 
underfinanced and unlikely to succeed bennett denies the first two 
complaints and dismisses the third as political pessimism 
the voters want something done about drugs they probably will 
punish failure if they can figure out whom to blame so far that 
hasnt happened but now there is a yardstick the goals bennett set 
for the bush drug strategy it calls for a 10 percent reduction in 
drug use by labor day 1991 the administration also seeks to cut 
crack use by addicts in half 
those clear and specific goals come due one year before the next 
presidential election campaign the bennett blueprint does provide a 
line of political insurance saying that the goals are realistically 
achievable only with full federal state and local implementation of 
the bush plan should they come up short the republicans can argue 
that they didnt get that kind of toptobottom action 
the drug job is at best a risky political assignment 
but bennett has dealt with risks before he made his national 
reputation as ronald reagans secretary of education running an 
agency the president once said he would eliminate near the end of 
his tour there bennett told a congressional critic that largely 
because of me it was likely the education slot would stay in the 
cabinet 
i made a hell of a commitment he said at a senate hearing 
storming back at a liberal republican who complained about budget 
cuts you just didnt like the direction i was damn successful 
so far the debate over the bush drug program has been restrained 
and polite but there will be some shouting before its over 
bennett is not given to lowprofile operations 
he made a point and angered a democrat last spring by refusing to 
show up for a senate hearing called by sen john glenn bennetts 
explanation with 74 congressional committees claiming some piece of 
the drug program he couldnt spend his time at their hearings or 
hed never get the plan finished 
now that its done he will be the chief salesman in speeches 
television appearances and at hearing after hearing before 
congress bennett has more than a dozen dates for congressional 
testimony this month before panels run by democrats who complain 
that theres not enough money in the bush program he has a script 
ready for them im just not going to be all that receptive to 
criticism of 8 billion from people whose current mark is 6 
billion theyre just not going to get away with that 
by bennetts reckoning nobody should be surprised at the 
political side of the drug program debate you cant get politics 
out of politics he said in mock surprise he said that since 
bushs drug speech political acts have been committed in this 
city 
bennett committed some himself 
for a couple of months i have been criticized by some for 
emphasizing law enforcement and judges and prosecutors he said in 
one of three almost simultaneous and almost identical television 
interviews the morning after the drug speech this goes on for 
quite some time and then i go to bed last night realizing that joe 
biden speaking for the democrats has moved to my right saying 
that we need more prosecutors more law enforcement 
biden chairman of the senate judiciary committee was an 
architect of the bill that created bennetts position and required 
the new drug strategy while there are political risks ahead there 
also are potential rewards so the democrats dont want their role 
forgotten 
biden said the reason bush made the drug speech in the first 
place was the law written in 1988 thats why the president was on 
tv he said hes required by law to lay that strategy out for 
the first time in our history

this time america cannot simply come home 
george bush speaks determinedly of victory but the fact remains 
a generation after vietnam that the united states is losing its 
second war 
again the carnage the brutality and the futility radiate nightly 
into living rooms across the land 
the scenes seem so familiar the dead being carried off in body 
bags wives and mothers grieving over senseless loss bewildered 
children ravaged by violence and disease commandos in flak jackets 
charging again and again into enemy havens only to find them 
quickly reoccupied 
this time the homefolks are not seeing these things just on 
television no matter how sickened they cannot demand that the 
politicians and the generals return their sons and daughters from 
some faraway combat zone because home is where the war is 
guerrillas are roaming the streets not of saigon but of los 
angeles and chicago and washington not the jungles of vietnam but 
the farmlands of iowa and minnesota 
bush like every president of the modern era has promised to win 
the drug war it will happen he said tuesday block by block 
child by child he has a new program latest in a long line in 
eight previous years bush by his own account was the handson 
administrator of president reagans drug war polls show most people 
believe that effort failed 
according to the drug enforcement administration crack cocaine 
has become the fast food of drugs and has spread from just three 
us cities eight years ago to virtually every state including 
rural areas now manifesting itself in all strata of society 
not a happy legacy for the crimefighting reaganbush administration 
now bush would channel 261 million into columbia and other 
andean nations to help finance the hunt for drug kingpins and their 
henchmen for whom human life is cheaper than a coca leaf 
meanwhile americas drug users are spending an estimated 100 
billion each year to keep them in business 
to this day some americans affix exclusive blame to foreign 
villains be they colombian drug lords corrupt thirdworld generals 
or jamaican immigrants a recent poll suggests a majority of the 
public would favor the use of us troops to wipe out the drug 
exporting centers around the globe 
others argue that supply only exists to satisfy demand and speak 
boldly of mandatory prison terms or hospital confinement for all 
drug abusers as if there were room for them all 
there isnt according to the american council for drug 
education 72 million americans or a whopping 37 percent of the 
population aged 12 or older have used illegal drugs at least once 
in their lifetime an estimated 145 million people had used them 
within a month of the federally sponsored national household survey 
on drug abuse last year 
an estimated 21 million americans have tried cocaine at least 3 
million are still occasional users and nearly a million are heavy 
users about 28 million people used one banned drug or another 
counting marijuana in the last year 
drugs favor no race sex or class threefourths of illicit drug 
users are white 41 percent are women including 5 million of 
childbearing age the drug education council says 11 percent of all 
babies born over the last year were exposed to illicit drugs during 
their mothers pregnancy 
drugs are in the schools the home and in the workplace eight 
percent of last years high school seniors said they had used 
cocaine over the previous year 10 percent of college students said 
they did so the drug council says 3 percent of workers between the 
ages of 20 and 40 are cocaine users in a recent survey the 
nations employers said as many as one in five workers have alcohol 
or illegal drug problems drugrelated absenteeism medical expenses 
and lost productivity are costing employers an estimated 3 percent 
of their payroll half the typical companys payment for an 
employees social security coverage 
there are some encouraging signs the national survey on drug 
abuse has found a recent decline in socalled casual drug abuse 
by young people two years ago an estimated 17 percent of college 
students were occasional users compared to 10 percent today 
but the number of heavy abusers particularly involving cocaine 
has risen sharply the percentage of weekly and daily cocaine 
users has doubled since 1986 the number of cocaineinduced deaths 
recorded by hospital emergency rooms totaled 1696 last year up 
from 604 in 1984 overall emergency rooms treated 46020 cocaine 
patients last year compared to 8831 in 1984 an increase of 421 
percent 
like the brasshat body counters in vietnam prosecutors and 
police often trumpet their battlefield victories to the news media 
seizures of vast quantities of drugs worth fortunes on the street 
massive arrests purporting to destroy this or that trafficking ring 
like lyndon johnsons tunnel light such announcements bear little 
semblance to the real course of the war 
fact is illicit drugs especially cocaine are in more plentiful 
supply at cheaper prices in more potent form than ever 
the marijuana smoked today is as much as 10 times more powerful 
than the stuff used by the flower child of the 1960s a california 
study shows the purty of cocaine sold on the streets increased from 
29 percent to 73 percent in just the two years between 1982 and 
1984 and has remained there the price has dropped to under 100 
per gram for the much purer deadlier drug 
urban slums have long been the stomping grounds of drug dealers 
but the arrival of crack a potent and cheap derivative of cocaine 
has done for those neighborhoods what gunpowder has done for beirut 
cocaine was once considered the rich mans drug with crack rocks 
selling for a mere 5 nearly anyone children included can find a 
way to obtain it 
pharmacologists say the drug itself chemically induces more 
paranoia and violence than most any other though another drug of 
choice pcp or angel dust can be as bad or worse and 
desperation among users prepared to rob and kill for the money to 
buy it and competition among sellers eager to establish 
trafficking monopolies heighten the explosive mix 
the firepower and disregard for innocent life exhibited by the 
gangs of young punks marketing crack from jamaicans in washington 
to the crips and bloods in los angeles is astonishing 
driveby killings the spontaneous murder of someone because he 
is dressed sometimes unwittingly in the colors of a rival gang 
have become commonplace in chicago the cops who raided the arms 
cache of one drug gang found the usual assortment of machine guns 
and sawedoff shotguns along with of all things a cluster bomb 
cluster bombs normally dropped from airplanes are designed to kill 
anyone within a wide area

the urban institute recently sent its drug reseachers into 
schools located in washingtons poorer neighborhoods where they 
interviewed adolescent boys in the ninth and 10th grades the 
information was later corroborated by criminal activity reports and 
school records eighty percent denied using or selling drugs but 28 
percent admitted carrying a concealed weapon 17 percent had 
participated in a group attack 13 percent admitted selling drugs 
making an average 1000 per week 11 percent had assaulted an 
adult and 5 percent had shot stabbed or killed someone 
and that from kids only 14 and 15 years old 
last month a justice department study in 14 major cities found 
that more than half the men arrested for any serious crime and who 
volunteered for drug testing were drug users in philadelphia the 
figure was 82 percent there should be no longer any question as 
to how much of a catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has 
become in america today attorney general dick thornburg said 
drug users and traffickers will beat rob and kill anyone for 
drugs and profits 
the toll of course is not limited to physical violence the 
house select committee on narcotics abuse and control estimated in 
february that there are 6 million to 65 million americans in need 
of drugabuse treatment including 13 million intravenous drug 
abusers currently treatment programs are available for only 
250000 abusers the committee said 
meanwhile quite aside from the thousands of drugstupified 
patients they treat hospital emergency rooms are soaked with the 
blood of drugrelated violence washingtons homicide rate 594 per 
100000 population edged out detroits last year to make the 
district of columbia the nations murder capital the majority of 
the killings were drug murders and the rate is climbing again this 
year 
washingtons police arrested 43000 people last year the vast 
majority were set free mostly because the city had no place to 
imprison them the same story applies in other cities in chicago 
misdemeanor offenders are released on personal recognizance because 
there is no room in the cook county jail nationwide fewer than one 
in six people arrested on drugtrafficking charges spend more than a 
year in jail 
rural america is hardly immune in a survey of all 93 us 
attorneys the justice department found cases involving major drug 
trafficking and related contract killings throughout the heartlands 
we knew that the country was awash in narcotics and dangerous 
drugs but we did not expect to find significant cocaine operations 
for example in wyoming or heroin trafficking in iowa said 
thornburgh 
crack he added is everywhere 
but cocaine is just the salt in americas drug stew colombias 
drug lords are not responsible for the 100000 elementary school 
children who get drunk at least once a week on the beer and 
fruitflavored wine coolers they see consumed by their parents and 
television heroes they are not responsible for the 48000 
youngsters who are killed or injured in automobile accidents caused 
by intoxicated drivers every year they are not responsible for the 
fivefold increase in lung cancer since 1963 among women who now 
smoke tobacco in nearly the same numbers as men 
the american council for drug education says half a billion 
workdays are lost each year because of alcoholism alone thats a 2 
percent loss in the nations productivity 
the federal government estimates that alcohol and drug abuse 
costs the economy nearly 200 billion a year twothirds of that is 
attributed to alcohol 
there is no end to this war alcoholics anonymous and narcotics 
anonymous the two most successful selfsupporting treatment 
programs know there is no such thing as a cured addict only a 
recovering one 
their members go about it one day at a time the government can 
do no better

should we all be checking out real estate 
in alaska or are scientists who warn of catastrophic global warming 
just blowing hot air 
sometimes its hard to tell admits one of those scientists at a 
recent conference here on global warming climatologist stephen 
schneider displayed two new york times articles from last january 
us data since 1895 fail to show warming trend one headline 
proclaimed 
global warmth in 88 is found to set a record said the other 
schneider turned to his audience and asked anybody here 
confused 
if so theyre not alone ever since the hot dry summer of 1988 
the news has been full of scientists grimly predicting droughts 
floods and famine if we dont act immediately to halt global 
warming at the same time others urge caution saying its foolish 
to solve a problem nobody has proved to exist 
while most scientists concur on the basic mechanism behind global 
warming there is less agreement over how much or how quickly the 
earth is heating up and even less over what should be done about 
it now politicians and special interests have leaped into the fray 
making it even harder for a concerned citizen to winnow science from 
speculation and reason from rhetoric 
here is a look at what scientists know and just as importantly 
dont know about global warming 
the underlying principle is called the greenhouse effect 
familiar to anyone who has left a car with the windows rolled up in 
a sunny parking lot the shortwavelength sunlight passes through 
the windows and is absorbed by the seats which give off 
longwavelength heat radiation thats trapped by the glass 
the windows in earths atmosphere are gases such as carbon 
dioxide methane and chlorofluorocarbons chemicals used in 
refrigeration and aerosol products they let sunlight through but 
trap heat radiated from the ground keeping it from escaping into 
space 
if anyone is dubious that a greenhouse effect can be 
dangerous says astronomer carl sagan just point them to our 
neighboring planets a thin atmosphere keeps mars in a 
deepfreeze while an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide keeps venus 
roasting like an oven 
earth meanwhile with a moderate carbon dioxide concentration 
has equable temperatures liquid water and abundant life 
but since 1850 earths atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased 
25 percent mostly due to burning fossil fuels during the same 
period average global temperature compiled from hundreds of 
monitoring stations has increased about 1 degree fahrenheit 
cause and effect common sense might suggest that rising levels 
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are responsible for 
global warming and that is the basis of mathematical models being 
used to predict future warming 
if nothing is done to reduce societys production of greenhouse 
gases the earth faces the equivalent of a doubling of carbon 
dioxide by the middle of the next century and that the various 
models predict could produce a global temperature rise of 2 to 10 
degrees 
the serious disagreement starts here 
robert jastrow former director of the national aeronautics and 
space administrations goddard institute for space studies 
questions both the accuracy of those models and the assumption that 
increasing greenhouse gases have already caused warming 
the past centurys warming trend could be due to natural climate 
variations or changes in the suns brightness he says and present 
climate models are so coarse that their treatment of how clouds 
affect warming varies by a factor of three such a wide discrepancy 
casts doubt on all the models he says 
but jastrows successor at the goddard institute james hansen 
is a leading supporter of the climate models though uncertainties 
remain he says they are unlikely to change his basic conclusion 
that a growing greenhouse effect will increase the frequency and 
severity of the extremes of the hydrologic cycle droughts on the 
one hand and extreme wetness and storms on the other 
while hansen and jastrow argue the big picture little nuggets of 
information are offered up almost daily providing fodder for each 
side of the global warming debate 
skeptics can use the first new york times story mentioned by 
schneider it noted that us temperatures since 1895 do nothing to 
confirm global warming but believers can point out that the united 
states occupies just 2 percent of the globe and they can cite the 
second times story which said that 1988 had the warmest average 
global temperature on record 
each finding may be accurate as far as it goes but how 
significant is it 
a warm year like 1988 may draw attention to global warming but 
most scientists now say last years us drought and heat were 
natural atmospheric fluctuations caused by cyclical swings in 
pacific ocean water temperatures 
yet the six warmest years on record all have been within this 
decade in order they are 1988 1987 1983 1981 1980 and 1986 
to sort out natures fickleness from longterm trends 
climatologists continually plug new factors into mathematical models 
already so complex it takes days to run them through powerful 
computers 
verifying the major effects of greenhouse warming could take 10 
to 20 years of observation hansen says by then some scientists 
warn it may be too lae to stop greenhouse warming already in the 
works 
a temperature change in the lower range of predictions might not 
cause catastrophic damage but a 10degree rise could expand ocean 
water and melt enough polar ice to raise sea level nearly three 
feet flooding coastal regions worldwide some scientists say 
despite the uncertainties many scientists and more recently 
government policymakers have decided global warming is too much of 
a risk to ignore 
in may the white house softened its goslow attitude to embrace 
the idea of a formal international treatynegotiating process on 
global warming 
citing a growing consensus among scientists the 
environmental protection agency in march urged the reduction of 
carbon dioxide through energy conservation techniques such as 
development of fuelefficient cars energysaving homes and solar 
technology 
but such measures can cost big money and maneuvering has already 
begun to protect special interests last month the oil industry 
released a study that concluded natural gas heat might contribute 
more to the greenhouse effect than oil heat the gas industry 
attacked the report as flawed and biased 
such spirited debate while not always enlightening at least 
keeps the issue of global warming alive and that schneider said 
is key a crisis last summers heat wave drew attention to 
global warming but addressing the problem will take a longterm 
commitment to research and action he said 
i hope that a cold wet winter or normal summer or two wont 
deter humanity from learning more about global warming he said 
the bottom line is we insult the environment at a faster rate 
than we understand the consequences

the catch from some of floridas most 
popular fishing spots is unhealthy and even fish and alligator meat 
from the protected everglades is off limits as test after test shows 
alarming levels of mercury 
if its so bad here in the everglades which is supposed to be 
so pristine and so pure then whats it like outside the park 
said pat tolle spokeswoman for everglades national park where 10 
times the federally set safe level of poisonous metal was found in 
fish and alligators 
health officials have warned against eating large amounts of fish 
from deer point lake near panama city and fishing spots down to the 
loxahatchee national wildlife refuge south of lake okeechobee the 
second annual alligator hunt was canceled in much of southern 
florida because the meat was tainted and high levels of mercury 
turned up in the tampa bay area and the suwannee river 
the levels of mercury usually associated with factories and 
processing plants shocked state experts when testing began last 
year 
an hour before we got the first results i would have been 
willing to say to someone not in florida because we dont have 
that type of industry said thomas savage a department of 
environmental regulation biologist 
but what were finding is that there is a chronic low level of 
mercury in fish statewide and then there are hot spots like the 
everglades 
wildlife officers are testing the rare florida panther and plan 
to do the same with wading birds they hope those animals unlike 
bass and alligators do not eat enough fish to ingest dangerous 
amounts of mercury but they say no one expected to find mercury in 
the first place 
birds and mammals need to be looked at said burkett neely 
manager at loxahatchee were doing testing into the estuary and 
out into florida bay and there youre getting into a commercial 
fishing zone 
if mercury is found in higher animals ms tolle said it might 
help explain one of the parks mysteries a drop in wading birds 
since 1900 the numbers now are 90 percent less that at the turn 
of the century 
mercurys effects on people damage to the nervous system that 
can cause deafness numbness reduced vision and coordination are 
well documented but little is known about what it can do to the 
complex ecology she said 
most people seem to be heeding the health advisories before the 
first warnings the florida game and fresh water fish commission 
found that fishermen relased 56 percent of the largemouth bass 
caught around loxahatchee after the warnings that climbed to 81 
percent said frank morello an agency biologist 
harder to convince are lowincome residents around the parks who 
supplement their diets by fishing and are suspicious or ignorant of 
the advisories but so far theres no evidence of anyone affected 
by mercury poisoning savage said 
of most concern is determining the origin of the contamination 
a prime suspect for the mercury present in lower levels around 
florida is airborne pollution savage said just like canada and 
the united states have an acid rain problem florida may have a 
problem with mercury 
that would explain why mercury is widespread but savage said 
some areas have virtually no mercury in fish undermining the theory 
when the initial findings were confined to loxahatchee prime 
suspects were farms south of okeechobee who once used nowbanned 
mercurybased fungicides but it became clear that agriculture alone 
wasnt enough of an explanation 
savage and others are looking at a theory that mercury which 
occurs in small amounts naturally may concentrate in certain 
plants which in turn die and are compressed into peat at the bottom 
of the everglades 
the peat down there that very rich everglades muck has 
naturally a very high level of mercury savage said its 
possible man has disrupted the peat with drainage and water 
movement mobilizing the mercury 
drainage canals and water movement could help explain why some of 
the highest concentrations are in areas of the everglades never 
exploited directly by man you have to look whats upstream 
neely said 
water in southern florida flows from the agricultural areas along 
lake okeechobee generally southward into the everglades he said 
its possible the mercury is being released naturally from the 
peat and is being moved up and down by farming practices 
whatever the cause the discovery has changed for the worse the 
way people look at their natural surroundings 
my worst fear is what else dont i know neely said what 
is this going to do to the wildlife what are the long term effects 
and what other bear traps are we going to step in out there

from the great seal of the united states to 
the folklore of native americans birds of prey have been powerful 
symbols of freedom dignity and strength 
but eagles hawks and other raptors also send another message 
because of their position near the top of the food chain they serve 
as environmental monitors warning of impending danger like canaries 
in a coal mine 
if we see things happening to these birds that signals us 
that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain 
said tom cade who founded the peregrine fund in 1970 while a 
professor at cornell university 
peregrine fund researchers and volunteers who helped bring the 
species back from near extinction now are applying what they 
learned to the study and preservation of raptors predatory birds 
distinguished by talons hooked beaks and keen eyesight from the 
jungles of guatemala to the plains of africa 
at the world center for birds of prey in the southwestern idaho 
desert researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release 
in the wild others are in the field collecting data on the birds 
in their native habitat 
their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain 
forests that are home to half the worlds plant and animal species 
and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes said bill 
burnham the centers director 
many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as 
their futures burnham said if you eliminate your natural 
resources if you cut down all your forests your children and your 
grandchildren wont have much to look forward to 
the impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries 
of the nations they cover many songbirds waterfowl and raptors 
considered indigenous to north america actually spend much of their 
time in the tropics 
wildlife do not recognize political boundaries burnham said 
you cant be provincial and manage a highly migratory species 
little is known about many of the tropical raptors and there 
is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about 
them he said 
in its maya project in guatemala and belize the peregrine 
fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see 
how the birds adapt to changes in their environment it also is 
trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much 
territory they need to survive and breed information that later 
can be used in establishing wildlife preserves 
for example the harpy eagle thought to be the most powerful 
eagle in the world may require 5000 acres or more for each pair 
cade said 
studying the birds first required finding them in the dense 
mosquitoinfested jungles from perches atop trees and ancient mayan 
temples researchers were able to observe some birds flying above 
the forest canopy other species were lured with taped calls the 
team has detected 26 raptor species in the two central american 
nations 
working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific 
background that can be applied to other raptors but it also helped 
them develop skills needed to work with other people burnham said 
cooperation is the key word we are not a confrontational 
organization we are a conservation organization that works together 
with other groups 
among those cooperating on the maya project are guatemalas 
institute of anthropology and history and the belize department of 
agriculture 
though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting the 
peregrine fund can take heart from past success when the odds were 
against them 
because of the effects of the pesticide ddt peregrine falcons 
once common in much of the united states had been had reduced to 35 
pairs by 1975 and none remained east of the mississippi largely 
through the efforts of the fund there now are more than 600 falcons 
in 25 states the groups goal is to have the birds removed from the 
endangered species list by the turn of the century 
its gone a long way further than i ever envisioned it back 
when we started cade said

more than 1100 measles cases have been reported 
in chicago as it copes with the worst outbreak in the resurgence of 
the disease this year 
the national centers for disease control said 1123 measles cases 
were reported to chicago health officials through aug 23 and that 
78 percent have occurred in preschool children in the united 
states 9650 measles cases have been reported in the united states 
compared with 2151 in the 1988 period 
the chicago outbreak is similar to others among innercity 
populations in the united states in that it involves primarily 
unvaccinated black and hispanic preschoolaged children the cdc 
said blacks and hispanics account for 94 percent of the chicago 
cases 
chicago authorities have set up at least seven new vaccination 
clinics which have administered at least 21000 doses of measles 
vaccine doortodoor teams have given at least 2000 more doses 
and the cdc said vaccination clinics have also been set up in four 
hospital emergency departments 
measles a oncecommon childhood disease was believed on the 
verge of eradication in this country in the early 80s just 1497

federal wildlife officials plan to split the 
worlds only captive colony of whooping cranes this november to 
reduce the chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural 
disaster 
the us fish and wildlife service said 22 of the 54 endangered 
birds at the patuxent wildlife research center would be shipped to 
the international crane foundation in baraboo wis 
the service has been concerned about having all of their eggs 
in one basket literally said david trauger the centers deputy 
director the service felt it was the prudent thing to do to 
separate the breeding flocks and theres enough breeders now to do 
that 
the center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds under a joint 
program with canadian wildlife officials the wisconsin foundation 
was selected as the home of the new flock after considering several 
groups across the nation 
although the foundation has not bred whooping cranes it has 
successfully bred 13 of the 14 other existing species of cranes in 
the world 
scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in 
captivity they will be able to establish another flock in the wild 
an attempt to do that failed in 1975 when an experimental flock at 
the grays lake national wildlife refuge in idaho failed to produce 
enough eggs to sustain the colony

arizona has a carcrash death rate seven times that of the nation as 
a whole 
the national centers for disease control said 24 people were 
killed in crashes on the reservation in 198586 a rate of 129 per 
100000 people thats nearly seven times higher than the us rate 
of 19 per 100000 and three times the national rate for indians and 
alaskan natives of 43 per 100000 
vehicle death rates go up as population density goes down and 
the rural location of the arizona tribe population 9300 may 
account in part for the elevated death rate the cdc said 
pedestrians accounted for seven of the 24 fatalities and the cdc 
said new streetlights were installed along pedestrian routes in

a computer chip covered with a sensitive 
membrane can indicate when nuclear detonators need replacement and 
could lead to wristwatchsized detectors for hazardous chemicals 
bombs and illicit drugs 
the chip no larger than a fingernail was developed by air force 
researchers air force and department of energy researchers will 
concentrate on joint study to develop chips to detect poison gases 
and degrading detonators 
i think what weve developed is a very sound scientific 
technique that can be used for detecting very small concentrations 
of gas said kolesar the chemicalsensitive membrane lets gas 
through to trigger an electronic signal 
such chips could be installed in nuclear warheads to detect the 
chemicals given off by the degradation of chemicals in the warheads 
he said what we really see though is that because the technology 
is generic by putting down different membranes its essentially 
limitless 
for example the devices could be used by workers to signal 
unacceptable levels of hazardous materials kolesar said 
dosimeters which are used in many cases to detect toxic materials 
only reveal exposure after the fact 
another possible application is in developing lighter and 
stronger metals by combining existing metals he said there is an 
optimum cure temperature and cure length cycle which the chip 
could be used to pinpoint 
it also could be used to ferret out bombs by the chemicals they 
emit current detectors for measuring contaminants are mostly bulky 
and vulnerable to being confused by the presence of more than one 
chemical he said 
the microchips so far have been developed to detect only organic 
phosphate and nitrogen dioxide said kolesar who has been working 
on the process for 12 years it will take another three to five 
years for commercial development 
its very rewarding to change something quite dramatically 
he said you probably get only one of those opportunities in 
life

more than 40 percent of chief executives surveyed 
nationwide favor introduction of a valueadded tax to help reduce 
the federal deficit according to a report 
but the report released wednesday by the conference board offered 
mixed conclusions on whether the enormous revenue potential of a 
valueadded tax or vat outweighs its drawbacks 
a valueadded tax is passed along during the stages of 
production from raw materials suppliers to manufacturers to 
wholesalers to retailers to consumers who bear the final burden of 
the tax 
at each stage buyers pay a progressively higher tax to sellers 
who recover a portion of the vat paid during earlier purchases 
the conference board report estimated that vat could raise 
between 13 billion and 22 billion annually in the united states 
for each percentage point of tax levied 
but it said a vat would not be cost efficient at below 10 percent 
and that countries employing the tax have rates between 15 percent 
and 25 percent 
in a survey of 400 chief executive officers asked recently to 
evaluate new revenue sources to reduce the deficit 42 percent 
favored a vat 35 percent were opposed and 33 percent were neutral 
many like vat because it has demonstrated its feasibility 
through a history of good compliance reasonable administrative 
costs and public preference conference board research associate 
jessica skelly said 
among concerns cited in the report though were the cost and 
number of employees that would be needed to implement and operate 
the tax 
the internal revenue service estimated that in 1988 the tax would 
have cost the government 700 million and required 20000 new 
employees other estimates have been higher the report said 
also opponents argue that vat would only allow the government to 
spend more money while not necessarily reducing the deficit and 
would place a greater burden on poor families who spend more on 
goods and services the report said 
the report also said that no way of coordinating the federal 
valueadded tax with state and local taxes such as sales taxes has 
been determined 
the conference board is a nonprofit research organization 
supported by companies trade and professional groups government 
agencies labor unions schools libraries and individuals

britains panel on takeovers and mergers says it 
will hold a hearing next week to decide whether hoylake investments 
ltd could extend its 214 billion hostile bid for bat industries 
plc beyond the normal 60day deadline 
a ruling on an extension would be pivotal to the outcome of the 
134 billionpound hostile offer for the british conglomerate 
analysts said 
last week sir james goldsmith who leads hoylake said it would 
be difficult for the offer to succeed without an extension from the 
panel an independent body which under british law monitors takeover 
developments 
the panel said wednesday that holylakes request would be 
considered at a hearing on wednesday 
hoylake made the request for an extension because it is seeking 
the required approval from insurance regulators in the united states 
for the acquisition of farmers group bats us insurance unit 
under the laws of the nine states where farmers operates 
officials must approve any change in control of insurance concerns 
hoylake launched its bid for bat on aug 8 under british law the 
first closing date for the offer is oct 7 
additional delays in gaining approval from insurance regulators 
could put hoylakes ability to meet that deadline into question 
bat has argued that the timetable is an integral part of takeover 
rules and should not be altered especially when delays in the us 
could have been anticipated 
meanwhile axa midi assurances the french company that would 
acquire farmers if hoylake is successful in its bid said it had 
begun seeking regulatory approval to buy the insurance company in 
the states where farmers operates 
farmers does business in texas washington oregon illinois 
ohio kansas idaho arizona and california 
hoylake has filed suit in those states claiming its purchase of 
bat would not constitute a change in control of farmers and that 
us regulators have no right to hold up a deal between two foreign 
companies 
axa has a us subsidiary gamma re a reinsurer which operates 
in 37 states 
bats other businesses include retailing tobacco and paper 
products it owns saks fifth avenue and marshall fields stores 
brown amp williamson tobacco corp and appleton papers in wisconsin 
goldsmith announced last month he would sell farmers to axa midi

the united states intervened in record amounts 
from late spring to mid summer to halt the dollars sharp ascent in 
foreign exchange which resulted from higher interest rates and 
political turmoil in china 
a quarterly foreignexchange report issued wednesday by the 
federal reserve bank of new york showed the fed and the treasury 
sold 1192 billion in exchange for west german marks and japanese 
yen during the three months ended july 31 
it was the largest intervention since the winter of 197879 when 
the government leaned the opposite way buying 69 billion with 
marks and yen to support a dollar that was being eroded by high 
inflation 
the previous largest sale of dollars occurred when the fed dumped 
32 billion from august to october of 1985 that sale reflected an 
agreement among the big industrialized nations known as the group 
of seven to lower the dollars value to shrink the us trade 
deficit 
the latest quarterly new york fed report showed the government 
bought 724 billion worth of yen and 468 billion worth of marks 
overseas central banks also sold dollars according to the report 
the united states sold 674 billion in may 495 billion in 
june and 230 million in july 
the dollar reached its peak of the year in early june when it 
traded at twoyear highs of 2047 marks and 15190 yen up roughly 9 
percent and 14 percent respectively from the end of april however 
by the end of july it was up just 3 percent against the yen and less 
than 1 percent vs the mark 
samuel y cross an executive vice president for the new york 
fed attributed the retreat from the peak to the central bank dollar 
sales and changing perceptions about the economy 
lately the dollar has been trading around 197 marks and 146 yen 
its highest levels since the mayjuly period due to signs of 
renewed strength in the economy 
currency traders already suspected that the fed had intervened 
heavily during the period but the feds policy is to comment only 
well after the fact in early 1987 the group of seven nations 
japan west germany britain france italy canada and the united 
states agreed to work together to stabilize the currency markets 
following a sharp decline in the dollar the group also secretly set 
target zones for exchange rates although it has never confirmed 
that the zones exist or what they are 
all the intervention we did could be taken as an indication we 
wanted to bring about greater stability in the exchange rates 
said cross were not driving it down as much as keeping it from 
rising 
fed intervention was the strongest in late may when the dollar 
first pierced the psychologically important 2mark and 142yen 
levels at that time investment demand was strong because us 
interest rates remained high in comparison to rates abroad 
during the dollars surge the economy appeared strong and the 
trade deficit seemed to be shrinking traders decided to test the 
central banks firmness in holding down the dollar 
also adding support to the dollar was political turmoil abroad 
including the bloody crackdown against student protesters in china 
and government scandals in japan 
by late june the dollar had softened as interest rates began to 
drop and signs of slower economic growth began to emerge

the biggest employeeowned company in the nation 
would be created if ual corps pilots and management succeed with 
their 675 billion bid for the parent of united airlines 
ual would lead a fastgrowing group in the past two years more 
than 300 us companies have been acquired by their employees 
according to joseph r blasi a business professor and expert on 
employee ownership 
federal tax benefits and the wave of hostile buyouts have spurred 
employees to take over their companies completely or acquire big 
equity stakes 
the latter category includes big corporations such as jc penney 
co inc lockheed corp procter amp gamble co polaroid corp and 
ppg industries inc 
chicagobased ual would enjoy marked advantages over other 
employeeowned enterprises some experts say the company is widely 
recognized as one of the strongest and most profitable in the 
airline industry giving it a head start under the new regime of 
employee owners 
ual chairman stephen wolf who is part of the takeover team has 
said that under the proposal the employees do not contemplate 
selling any essential assets or revising plans for expanding the 
airline fleet and routes 
the fact that united is in good shape certainly does give 
employee ownership a better start corey rosen executive 
director of the national center for employee ownership said 
wednesday 
its the first time its been tried on this scale if it 
succeeds it would put in a whole new array of weapons for unions to 
use 
thats a fairly big if the machinists union at united whose 
cooperation is considered critical has expressed doubt that the 
takeover attempt could succeed because it would require enormous new 
debt 
i look at it sort of pessimistically now because weve done an 
analysis on united airlines i think theyve put a price on it 
thats too overpriced john peterpaul general vice president of 
the machinists said wednesday we dont see the future as rosy as 
a lot of people see it 
that stance appeared to strengthen the chances that billionaire 
investor marvin davis could succeed in his rival bid for ual 
if the pilotmanagement attempt does prevail ual would displace 
car rental giant avis inc as the nations largest company owned by 
its employees 
an employee stock ownership plan or esop representing 11000 
avis workers in the united states took the company private in a 
175 billion buyout in september 1987 
avis chairman joseph vittoria says he received a letter over a 
year ago from the united pilots seeking his advice on esops 
i dont think uals size is a hindrance to an esop vittoria 
said in a telephone interview asked whether its size could actually 
be an advantage for employee ownership he replied it could be 
but it depends on management getting employees involved 
avis has a multitiered employee participation program that is 
considered a model by some experts worker representatives are 
elected by their coworkers and participate in monthly 
districtlevel meetings with managers to review operations and make 
suggestions 
the local groups also elect representatives to attend quarterly 
zone meetings semiannual regional meetings and an annual 
companywide meeting 
under the ual pilotmanagement proposal british airways plc 
would own 15 percent of uals stock for an investment of 750 
million the employees would agree to unspecified wage concessions 
in exchange for participation in an esop that would give them 75 
percent of the company 
news reports have indicated that the pilots union might invest as 
much as 1 billion the rest of the buyout funding apparently would 
be borrowed 
only a small proportion about 15 percent of the employees 
participating in esops are unionized but the pilots machinists and 
flight attendants at united the nations secondlargest airline 
are strong unionists 
ual under employee ownership would have to be run as a 
partnership not as a feudal barony said blasi a professor at 
california polytechnic university in san luis obispo whose book 
employee ownership revolution or ripoff is critical of some 
esops 
in the airline industry most esops have not been combined with 
a strong employee involvement program board seats are not enough 
he said 
blasi said he is waiting to see specific details from wolf and 
the pilots on how labormanagement committees would be set up to 
address problems and make decisions 
he cited a 198384 experiment with partial employee ownership at 
eastern airlines under former chairman frank borman which he 
called a great success under the program eastern employees 
generated ideas to improve productivity 
an esop at western airlines before it was merged into delta air 
lines also was a good example of labormanagement cooperation 
blasi said 
america west airlines an aggressive regional carrier based in 
tempe ariz is about 20 percent owned by its employees and delta 
established an esop in july in a moved widely viewed as a deterrent 
to unwanted suitors as takeover speculation swept through the 
airline industry

as an example it cited cuts in the budgets of most agencies for 
collecting and analyzing data during the past eight years and a 
resistance by omb officials to allow new surveys sought by 
statisticians 
these organizations are painfully aware of the problems the 
researchers said the greatest problem appears to be the absence 
of any central place in government where basic questions about 
priorities in statistics are being asked 
sen jeff bingaman dnm chairman of the senate panels 
subcommittee on government information and regulation said congress 
will likely have to force the issue when the 1980 paperwork 
reduction act comes up for reauthorization next year 
barbara clay a spokeswoman for the white house budget office 
said its officials had not seen the report and so could not comment 
on it immediately 
the congressional researchers acknowledged it has become much 
more difficult to develop meaningful statistics on economic growth 
and productivity with the emergence of an international market and a 
servicebased us economy 
the most important inputs purchased by a business may be 
research and engineering information and the skills and education of 
its employees it said the existing statistical system makes it 
extremely difficult to anticipate the potential impact of emerging 
technologies 
it cited computers and how changes in their capabilities and 
prices are reflected in the nations economic growth inflation and 
productivity figures for example it said the price of one 
megabyte of computer memory capacity fell by 95 percent between 1972 
and 1987 
measuring changes in the quality of computers however can 
seem easy in comparison with the challenge of measuring changes in 
the quality of services the report said how do you measure 
quality changes in legal services 
changes in the quality of health care and education which 
together account for more than onesixth of the nations gross 
national product are not measured at all the report said

after months of challenges and delays drexel 
burnham lambert inc is scheduled to plead guilty to securities 
crimes monday and formally settle the highly publicized wall street 
corruption case 
the court date was set after prosecutors switched course and 
allowed the investment firm to pay its former junkbond chief 
michael milken his 1988 compensation of more than 100 million 
removing the last roadblock to the plea bargain 
we are pleased that the government has reversed its position 
and dropped the unconstitutional provisions of its settlement with 
drexel arthur liman a lawyer for milken said in a statement 
released wednesday by a milken spokesman 
these unconstitutional provisions were a gross abuse of 
prosecutorial power the statement said perhaps now the 
government will also reconsider its use and abuse in this case of 
the draconian rico statute 
a 98count indictment in march charged milken and his brother 
lowell with wideranging securities law and racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organization act violations a broader indictment is 
expected next month 
the hearing monday before us district judge kimba wood in 
manhattan should end months of negotiations and challenges over an 
agreement announced in january in the governments insider trading 
probe 
the governments reversal to allow drexel to pay its indicted 
former bond financier was made in court papers filed late last week 
the move was first reported to be under consideration last month 
under the plea agreement drexel will enter guilty pleas to six 
securities and mail fraud felonies the firm also has agreed to pay 
650 million in fines and restitution 
the pact had required drexel to fire milken and withhold his 
compensation for last year estimated in court papers at more than 
100 million the agreement also had barred drexel from giving 
lowell milken more than half his 1988 pay 
both milkens have since resigned from drexel 
in a letter to wood filed in us district court late friday 
assistant us attorney john k carroll said prosecutors dropped the 
pay provisions because of a bail agreement in which the government 
will monitor hundreds of millions of dollars of the milkens assets 
in light of this security the matter of any payment to be made 
by drexel to the milkens can be resolved adequately between drexel 
and the milkens the letter said 
lawyers for the milkens immediately dropped a motion filed in 
january challenging the plea agreement on the grounds that it 
unfairly denied the brothers their 1988 pay 
defense lawyers and other experts following the case have said 
they surmised the government dropped the provision withholding pay 
because of a belief it would be rejected in court as 
unconstitutional 
sources familiar with the case said the government acted 
independently 
it was the government deciding on its own 100 percent that 
they wanted to drop it said one source who asked not to be named 
a separate settlement with drexel of fraud and insider trading 
charges by the securities and exchange commission is to take effect 
once drexel enters its plea under that deal drexel has agreed to 
broad structural changes and federal supervision for three years

a us district judge says that plaintiffs in the 
nations largest municipalbond default might have gotten 
significantly smaller awards had they won their case at trial 
instead of settling 
us district judge william d browning of tucson ariz on 
tuesday approved settlements to allow 750 million to be distributed 
to holders of washington public power supply system bonds in what he 
called one of the most complex lawsuits in the history of 
securities litigation 
there is more than adequate reason to conclude that the 
aggregate amount of these settlements is fully satisfactory 
given the risks associated with a full trial of the issues said 
chemical bank of new york trustee for the bondholders in a 
statement quoting the judges 106page opinion which was not 
immediately available 
it was browning who presided over the enormously complicated 
wppss litigation that in the last year resulted in settlements 
between chemical bank and defendants in the case 
the trial began a year ago in tucson but defendants reached 
settlements by january in april browning held a fairness hearing 
on the settlement in seattle 
william h berls a chemical bank vice president who has handled 
wppss matters on wednesday called brownings ruling a carte 
blanche approval of the negotiated settlements 
this is a major milestone in the wppss litigation he said 
the bondholders are just one step away from distribution of the 
settlement money 
the final step is for browning to schedule a distribution 
hearing at which attorneys will argue precisely how the funds 
should be distributed berls said no such hearing has been 
scheduled he said 
in determining the distribution the judge will emphasize when 
each bondholder purchased the bonds berls said the plaintiffs in 
the case essentially broke down into two types of bondholders those 
who purchased their bonds before the default on june 15 1983 and 
those who bought bonds afterward 
in 1983 wppss defaulted on 225 billion in bonds it had sold to 
finance construction of a nuclear power plant at the hanford nuclear 
reservation in eastern washington and another at satsop west of 
olympia wppss had abandoned construction of those two plants in 
1982 because of rising construction costs and doubts about the need 
for the plants power 
the default was triggered by a washington state supreme court 
ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to 
sign contracts with wppss guaranteeing payment even if no 
electricity was generated 
dozens of lawsuits were combined into one action against wppss 
all 88 utilities that contracted with the consortium to build the 
two reactors engineering firms wall street bond underwriters 
utility and wppss directors and a consulting firm 
the settlements approved require the defendants to pay 580 
million into the chemical bankadministered settlement fund 
together with 107 million in settlements approved earlier plus 
interest the amount available for distribution in december would be 
750 million berls said 
berls said chemical bank was not worried that browning would have 
exercised his other option that of rejecting the settlements 
brownings ruling validated all the actions weve taken 
berls said 
i think the court by taking the action it did endorsed the end 
we were all trying to reach which was peace he said 
wppss paid no money in the settlement in exchange for cooperation 
from its employees at the trial plaintiffs attorneys said there 
wasnt enough money left in wppss to pursue 
wppss was building five nuclear reactors to generate electricity 
in the late 1970s but only one was completed two remain 
mothballed for construction to resume if enough demand 
materializes for the electricity they would produce

a 214 percent rise in lateaugust car and light 
truck sales may be a sign that sales will drop dramatically as the 
calendar year draws to a close analysts say 
the eight major us based automakers reported wednesday that 
their vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 49276 during the 
aug 2131 period this year compared with a rate of 40578 during 
the same time last year 
we think a lot of the volume that were seeing here is really 
coming out of the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter 
of next year said analyst john kirnan of kidder peabody amp co of 
new york city 
the 64000 question is really how bad is volume going to be in 
the fourth quarter he said 
with overseas makers results added in car and truck sales were 
up 84 percent in august over the same month last year car sales 
rose 112 percent and truck sales were 22 percent higher for the 
month 
typically dealers offer closeout deals as the model year draws 
to a close traditionally on sept 30 on top of that manufacturers 
have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower the 
prices of 1989 cars 
consumers also have been learning that prices for 1990 cars will 
rise prompting some to buy now rather than later 
consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990 
models going up anywhere from 2 percent to 9 percent said 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc 
of new york city domestic automakers havent done that in a long 
time 
its people out there thinking ive got to buy a car by the 
end of the year 
herb adcox owner of adcox chevrolet in chattanooga tenn said 
he has seen some increased traffic through his showroom recently 
and incentives are the reason 
with this factory incentive that they have given the dealers 
its going to lower the price of the car he said i just hope 
that it works 
if it doesnt youve got a lot of dealers who are not going to 
order 90 models they cant have inventory on top of inventory 
for the first eight months of this year domestic and imported 
car and truck sales were running 37 percent behind the pace of last 
year the secondbest year in history car sales were down 41 
percent and truck sales were off 27 percent 
domestic automakers held 773 percent of the car and truck market 
at the end of august up from 76 percent at the same time last year

the american consumers continuing taste for 
chicken has prompted mcdonalds corp to begin eyeing the 
friedchicken market 
mcdonalds has begun a new test at six restaurants in dallas and 
six in houston selling combination packets of two three and nine 
pieces of deepfried chicken 
americans are going toward lighter eating and were following 
the tastes of america said tom horler regional marketing manager 
for the dallas region 
the company already serves chicken in sandwiches salads and in 
bitesize boneless bits 
the testing is in the embryonic stage said horler the 
question is can we deliver a good quality valuepriced product in 
the quick environment we have 
to find this out the company is looking at how its equipment is 
handling the new product and what customers think about it 
sometimes as with the companys experimental pizza the product 
goes back to the kitchen for a recipe makeover after the operational 
testing and before it goes out for a full market test 
mcdonalds salads were in the testing phase for 10 years before 
being made generally available horler said 
the fried chicken is being sold after 4 pm aimed at the family 
dinner business 
there are three combinations two pieces a breast and leg 
selling for 199 three pieces breast leg and thigh for 289 
and nine pieces three breasts three legs and three thighs for 
789 dinner rolls are included 
the chicken is kept frozen and then fried for customers 
no decision has been made on whether to expand the fried chicken 
experiment horler said

hj heinz co chairman anthony jf oreilly 
says his company and animal rights activists stand in agreement 
the slaughter of dolphins caught with yellowfin tuna must end 
aside from humanitarian reasons oreilly said heinz has a 
commercial interest in saving the dolphins because dolphins swim 
with tuna in the eastern pacific ocean leading fishing boats to 
their catch 
we have more interest in the porpoise than they have if you 
see them as the sheepdog of the sea oreilly said the simple 
truth is that releasing dolphins represent a more successful fishing 
technique than ignoring their safety 
oreilly reacted after about 50 protesters led by the san 
franciscobased earth island institute picketed heinzs annual 
shareholders meeting at a downtown hotel wednesday carrying 
antiheinz signs and chanting boycott tuna boycott heinz 
two protesters todd patterson 23 of pittsburgh and mark 
heitchue 24 of santa cruz calif lowered themselves from a 
nearby eightstory building and unfurled a banner reading heinz 
stop killing dolphins before police arrested them on disorderly 
conduct criminal trespass and criminal mischief charges 
another protest organizer candace batycki of san francisco 
briefly disrupted the shareholders meeting by screaming youre 
slaughtering dolphins what kind of world do you want to live in 
protesters and company officials agreed thousands of dolphins are 
being killed with yellowfin tuna in large encircling nets set 
mostly by foreign fishermen 
ms batycki estimated at least 150000 dolphins die in the catch 
annually 
its not necessary to fish on dolphins just easier she 
said they heinz have a lot of power in their hands they have 
the power to end this 
protesters claimed a boycott of tuna products has hurt heinzs 
starkist seafood co subsidiary and other producers oreilly 
estimated pacific yellowfin tuna represents 20 percent of starkists 
catch 
but heinz in its firstquarter earnings report issued tuesday 
said starkists tuna contributed to a 15 percent increase in 
earnings 
our sales of tuna are at an alltime high oreilly said 
but he told shareholders the killing of dolphins was a 
legitimate concern 
were doing everything we can to save the porpoise oreilly 
said 
a new 100000 research program announced by starkist last 
thursday promises to find ways of using sound to lure dolphins away 
or out of fishing nets he said 
heinz spokesman d edward i smyth said the company is willing to 
spend more if early research is fruitful 
none of about 3000 heinz shareholders questioned oreilly about 
the dolphins issue but they applauded warmly at a review of heinzs 
television commercials and when oreilly announced a twoforone 
stock split and a 167 percent increase in quarterly dividends 
on other matters oreilly said heinz will not accept irradiated 
food from suppliers and will not use radiation in any of its food 
processing 
sister patricia daly of the sisters of st dominic of caldwell 
nj representing several roman catholic institutions holding heinz 
stock said heinzs policy follows a request by the interfaith 
center on corporate responsibility 
she called heinzs policy an unprecedented move by any us 
corporation 
oreilly also told reporters the company is trying to expand its 
food products into the gray market of senior citizens he said 
heinz believes todays consumers will be more concerned with 
health and wellness as they age 
he declined to speculate what products or companies the food 
conglomerate might produce or buy

three exheirs to the pacific lumber co 
have filed suit against drexel burnham lambert inc of new york 
charging fraud during the financing of a hostile buyout of the 
company 
the suit filed wednesday in humboldt county superior court said 
stanwood murphy jr suzanne murphy and warren murphy received 40 a 
share for stock that was actually worth more than 70 a share it 
seeks 18 million from drexel to cover the difference 
the murphys are descendants of simon j murphy who bought 
pacific lumber in humboldt county in 1905 it was bought by texas 
investor charles hurwitzs maxxam group in 1985 
the suit also names as defendants former drexel junkbond king 
michael milken and former wall street financier ivan boesky who the 
suit claims secretly bought stock for drexel 
the suit claims a scheme to take over the lumber company at a 
cheaper price was worked out in secret talks in the spring of 1985 
between drexel and unnamed maxxam officals hurwitz was not named as 
a defendant in the suit 
according to the lawsuit drexel knew it would be able to sell 
these shares to maxxam through boesky at a profit but did not 
disclose its intentions 
the suit contends that at the time maxxam was attempting the 
takeover drexel filed a false affidavit indicating that it did not 
own any pacific lumber stock 
the suit contends drexel owned more than 5 percent of the redwood 
lumber company with boesky acting as its representative 
pacific lumbers articles of incorporation required 80 percent 
shareholder approval of a merger deal if any stockholder owned more 
than 5 percent of the company maxxam held about 46 percent of the 
companys stock 
since drexel concealed its stake during the takeover attempt 
shareholders assumed that the maxxam bid needed only 51 percent 
shareholder approval the suit contends many shareholders 
believing they would be unable to stop a simplemajority approval 
decided to sell to maxxam the suit maintains 
the suit says that concern that the drexel affidavit was false 
surfaced in september of 1988 when the securities and exchange 
commission filed charges against drexel in a celebrated 
securitiesfraud case 
drexel has agreed to settle that case by pleading guilty to six 
felony fraud counts and paying a 650 million fine 
boesky is serving a federal prison sentence after pleading guilty 
to unrelated securitieslaw violations los angelesbased milken 
former head of drexels junkbond unit has been charged with 
separate securities violations 
drexel officials could not be reached for comment

president bush has nominated prominent 
manhattan defense lawyer otto g obermaier as successor to former 
us attorney rudolph giuliani the crimebusting prosecutor now 
running for new york mayor 
obermaiers nomination wednesday which had been widely 
anticipated is expected to receive routine confirmation by members 
of the senate judiciary committee though giuliani once said he 
opposed the nomination because obermaiers firm has represented 
targets of securities fraud investigations 
i may be naive in that regard but i am more than happy to 
answer any of their questions obermaier said in an interview from 
new york after the nomination was announced 
ive practiced law for 30 years and the great thing about being 
a litigator is we do all our professional work in public the 
mistakes and the glories and the victories are all a matter of 
public record he said 
obermaier 53 said he has none of the skeletons in the closet 
that have derailed some recent federal judicial nominations as well 
as sitting politicians 
i dont think i buy outdated milk he said i dont think i 
speed at least i dont get caught at it i pay my taxes ill even 
answer questions like have i ever used drugs the answer is 
indeed no 
giuliani who resigned jan 31 has been temporarily succeeded by 
acting us attorney benito romano who said he would work with 
obermaier for a smooth transition and then would return to private 
law practice 
as us attorney giuliani was at the forefront of the recent 
wall street scandals prosecuting numerous cases of insider trading 
and stock manipulation 
obermaier of syosset ny is a founding partner in the law 
firm obermaier morvillo and abramowitz which specializes in 
whitecollar cases he was recommended for the job in january by 
sen alfonse damato rny 
from 1964 to 1968 obermaier was an assistant us attorney in 
the southern district prosecuting cases involving organized crime 
tax evasion and narcotics his boss was robert m morgenthau who is 
now manhattan district attorney

the miller brewing co says it will stop 
production of its matilda bay wine cooler in early november because 
of poor sales 
from a business standpoint it is economically imprudent for us 
to continue production and marketing of matilda bay thomas a 
koehler vice president of sales said in a prepared statement 
wednesday 
koehler said the wine cooler segment declined more than 14 
percent in 1988 and industry analysts are predicting this rate of 
decline to continue or increase this year 
miller said the action would not affect employment at its brewery 
in albany ga the only facility where matilda bay is produced 
beverly jurkowski a miller spokeswoman said employees now 
working on the matilda bay line would get jobs in other areas of the 
brewery 
ms jurkowski said matilda bay had climbed to the fourth most 
popular wine cooler in the country but said the brand never made 
money nationally 
the chips get pretty spread out by the time you get to no 4 
she said 
the product differed from most wine coolers in that it was 
noncarbonated 
millers move means stroh brewery co detroit will be the only 
major brewery still selling wine coolers

politics are secondary to business in 
sultry shanghai where teeming sidewalks old brick mansions and 
bustling bars and dance halls yield few signs that police crushed 
mass protests two months ago 
shanghai residents once famous for their business acumen in 
china and beyond are more concerned about the economy than with 
political maneuverings to the north in the capital beijing city 
officials and citizens say 
so far shanghai has been spared nationwide moves to suppress 
private entrepreneurs and capitalist ideas some attribute the 
reprieve to the protection of former shanghai leader jiang zemin 
who in june replaced ousted leader zhao ziyang as head of chinas 
communist party 
in contrast with beijing guarded by armed soldiers shanghai 
seems almost apolitical 
the university students who led the prodemocracy demonstrations 
here in june face mandatory political education but shanghais 
workers have been spared that fate 
a workers first responsibility is to produce says yang 
xianghai deputy chief of the city planning commission our 
workers need to improve the quality of their work their morality 
and discipline but were not having political education 
shanghai seems to be busy making up for time lost in june as it 
tries to proceed with an ambitious industrial restructuring program 
aimed at making the city an international economic center that would 
resurrect its historical preeminence in asia 
government figures show the sprawling citys industrial output 
has jumped by more than 77 percent over the past nine years because 
of economic liberalization and joint ventures with foreigners that 
range from medical equipment to aircraft and car assembly 
but shanghai remains encumbered a burgeoning population of more 
than 6 million people that overwhelm the decaying infrastructure of 
a city still crammed with crumbling 40yearold factories 
city planners say one of their main goals is to replace plants 
that produce cheap products like windup watches and plastic toys 
with industries that make hightech goods for sale abroad 
we want to increase our exports which now account for only 15 
percent of our total production with high quality bicycles and 
electronics goods sophisticated electrical machinery and basic 
industrial inputs yang says 
weve been producing just about everything here and its not 
to our advantage its too disorganized he says were paring 
away sectors that arent much use there are some industries we just 
wont be able to save 
the city faces severe shortages of raw materials and energy in 
its efforts to modernize an official report noted recently that 
many factories were closed for two or three days a week due because 
of insufficient electricity and other scarce resources 
shanghais mostly statecontrolled industries also have suffered 
from chinas general predicament of skyrocketing costs for raw 
materials while retail prices remain under strict controls 
for decades china relied on shanghais staterun industries to 
help foot the governments bill for the rest of the developing 
economy the city retained little for its own upkeep 
a new policy allowing shanghai to use locally all but 17 percent 
of its tax revenues gave the city an extra 14 billion yuan worth 
about 376 million at todays exchange rates but a nationwide 
economic slowdown and a yearold fiscal austerity program have 
resulted in a 3 billionyuan shortfall in investment funds zhu 
xiaohua deputy director of the shanghai branch of the peoples bank 
of china reported recently 
in the first six months of this year the city postponed 
construction of 1612 projects and slashed its total investment by 
516 billion yuan or about 139 billion 
it also stopped or restricted production of 109 products as it 
set priorities for using scarce resources 
in a bid to scrounge additional cash the city sent salesmen to 
chinas remote northwestern provinces of inner mongolia and 
xinjiang where factories arent so plentiful to try to sell an 
estimated 1 billion yuan worth of excess televisions refrigerators 
washing machines and bicycles yang said 
plans to make shanghai an international financial center also 
have been stymied by the lack of available cash foreign executives 
and officials say 
shanghais fledgling stock exchange where 1625 companies have 
issued shares has a total stock value of only 800 million yuan or 
215 million 
yang says the city hopes to go ahead however with major 
renovation and modernization projects including a new harbor a 
subway system and new sewage and telephone lines despite foreign 
exchange and local currency shortfalls 
shanghais government also is building satellite towns around the 
city and plans to raze old buildings to make way for spacious 
apartment blocks and green parks industrial centers and 
international hotels are sprouting amid the citys old red and gray 
brick mansions 
shanghais ability to pull off plans to create a modern city in 
the end may depend on the fate of shanghais leaders urbane 
bureaucrats like communist party secretary general jiang and 
shanghai mayor zhu rongji 
some analysts attribute the citys continuing relative freedom to 
pursue its economic goals to jiangs protection but jiang is 
increasingly being seen as an interim leader whose influence at the 
top may be shortlived

talks on opening south koreas closed 
telecommunications market to the united states bogged down thursday 
with both sides showing few signs of compromise officials said 
the seoul talks were called after the united states named south 
korea as an unfair trader in telecommunications in february under 
the 1988 trade act calling for tough retaliatory trade sanctions 
the meeting began wednesday and continued until late thursday 
night but there was little chances of agreement said officials at 
the communications ministry 
gordana earp the chief us delegate asked south korea to 
announce a timetable to open its market before july 1 next year but 
seoul officials refused to comply saying their telecommunications 
industry needs two or three more years to grow the ministry 
official said 
south korea expressed willingness to accept parts of washingtons 
demands to open its market to us telecommunications equipment but 
refused to allow direct us investment in the market for 
valueadded networks the official said 
earp strongly indicated that washington may impose trade 
sanctions against south korea unless its demand was fully accepted 
he said 
the telecommunications talks were the first in a series of 
intensive trade negotations scheduled in the coming months between 
the two countries 
seoul officials are concerned that washingtons trade pressure 
will get tougher in the coming months when us vice president dan 
quayle commerce secretary robert mosbacher and trade representative 
carla hills visit seoul 
mosbacher is scheduled to visit seoul sunday through tuesday to 
discuss wideranging trade issues presumably with emphasis on south 
koreas marketopening measures 
mosbacher is expected to seek to further open south koreas 
agricultural market to us beef and other farm products and demand 
seouls stricter protection of us intellectual property rights 
korean officials said 
the two countries signed an agreement for protection of 
intellectual property rights in 1985 but the united states has 
complained that south korea neglected its strict enforcement 
mosbacher is also expected to raise a plan by du pont co to 
construct a 150 million plant in south korea 
south korea under washingtons pressure opened its market to 
243 us agricultural products in may but the united states says the 
action was not enough accoring to seoul officials 
south korea is washingtons second largest agricultural market in 
the world after japan it imported 23 billion worth of us farm 
products last year 
washington ran a trade deficit of 85 billion with south korea 
last year

project in western japan to disband a pricefixing cartel 
in a similar move japans fair trade commission has ordered 24 
shipbuilders to end a production cartel by october it was reported 
the actions seem to indicate japan is responding to us 
criticisms that pricefixing cartels prevent foreign firms from 
competing for business in japan 
james f rill assistant attorney general of the us justice 
department told fair trade commission chief setsuo umezawa in a 
meeting wednesday that japan should strictly enforce the 
antimonopoly law said the asahi shimbun a major national 
newspaper 
rill participated in japanus trade talks earlier in the week 
in which american officials said business practices such as 
collusion were preventing progress in shrinking the us trade 
deficit with japan 
umezawa told rill the fair trade commission would take strong 
action against violators of laws prohibiting private monopolies and 
maintaining fair trade and said violators of those laws would be 
treated with a stern attitude the paper reported 
the kyodo news service quoting reliable sources said late 
thursday that the fair trade commission had ordered 24 top 
shipbuilders to disband a cartel formed to help them weather a 
serious slump in the industry 
japanese officials were not immediately available for comment 
late thursday evening 
the fair trade commissions order to disband the construction 
cartel followed a yearlong investigation into a pricefixing 
agreement among contractors supplying sand for the kansai 
international airport said a commission official 
the kansai airport became the focus of a major dispute between 
japan and the united states three years ago when us officials 
claimed that corporate collusion and obscure bidding procedures were 
preventing foreign companies from winning contracts 
construction of the 67 billion airport off osaka began in 
january 1987 with completion of the first phase of the nations 
first 24hour commercial airport slated for 1993 
mitsuo omura representing the eightcompany offshore reclamation 
construction association told a news conference in osaka wednesday 
the cartel was necessary and an appropriate method to smoothly 
carry out a big national project like the kansai airport 
but an official at major construction firm ohbayashi corp 
speaking on condition of anonymity said we will discuss the 
matter with other firms a way to accept the commissions order 
the ftc identified the members of the cartel as ohbayashi kajima 
corp aoki corp takenaka doboku co saeki kensetsu kogyo and 
yorigami construction co 
the masscirculation mainichi shimbun said thursday the six firms 
would be fined a total of 22 million in surcharges equivalent to 
15 percent of the total value of sand supplied to the project 
the construction association which has two weeks to notify the 
antitrust agency whether it will comply with the order faces 
exclusion from bidding on public works projects including those of 
other local governments the newspaper said

westinghouse electric corp is developing a new 
generation nuclear power plant by adopting aspects of the first 
generation of commercial reactors smaller simpler and believed to 
be safer 
features like this in the 90s and the next century are really 
going to be required for the public to have confidence in nuclear as 
a power source said richard j slember vice president and 
general manager of the companys energy systems business 
the department of energy late wednesday confirmed it is awarding 
a team led by westinghouse 50 million to design a plant that could 
be licensed and replicated as needed by electric utilities 
with a projected fiveyear construction schedule costs of under 
2 billion and simplified operation and maintenance the new 
600megawatt advanced passive plant or ap600 could overcome the 
decadelong delays skyrocketing costs and some of the controversy 
involved in contemporary plants 
todays nuclear power plants most of them significantly 
different from the others are rated for 1300 to 1400 megawatts 
and cost around 10 billion 
we have nothing to lose how many people have ordered a nuclear 
power plant in the last 10 years nobody slember said late 
wednesday 
the ap600 a light water reactor using standard uranium fuel 
will be built in large segments in factories and assembled at the 
permanent site affording greater precision and higher quality 
westinghouse the us leader in nuclear power plant design 
hopes to have the ap600 ready to market in time for the next wave of 
construction in the electric utility industry 
many places have gone past the point where its unlikely they 
can meet the power demands without brownouts no matter what they do 
in the short run slember said citing new york and long island 
somethings got to happen 
success with the ap600 could also stretch the us lead in 
nuclear power technology he said 
energy department spokesman dan butler on thursday declined 
comment on published reports that general electric corp has also 
been picked for a 50 million grant to develop a similar reactor 
westinghouse identified the members of its team as chicago bridge 
amp iron co bechtel north american power corp avondale industries 
inc burns amp roe co and mk ferguson unit of morrison knudson 
corp together with the electric power research institute the team 
would match the 50 million grant with cash and services said 
westinghouse spokeswoman mimi limbach 
the ap600 will use sealed motor pumps like the pumps used in 
the navy slember said they run without maintenance for years 
and years theyre hermetically sealed so you dont have to 
worry about leaks during an accident 
the number of valves and large pumps and the length of pipe have 
all been reduced by 60 percent there is 80 percent less control 
cable 50 percent fewer heat exchangers and 35 percent less heating 
cooling and ventilation ductwork 
the portions of the powerplant that must be fortified to 
withstand earthquakes has been cut by 60 percent 
if an accident occurs if a pipe breaks were not dependent on 
a large number of pipes and valves operating to cool the reactor 
slember said 
a large tank above the core would allow water to flow by gravity 
to cool the reactor while the steel containment vessel would 
dissipate heat air set in motion by temperature differences would 
flow from the outside to pick up heat from the reactor and pass out 
the top of the building 
today you have containment spray systems and fan coolers that 
depend on pumps and valves and a fair amount of electric power 
slember said contemporary cooling systems require safety grade 
diesel engines for backup power 
westinghouse began considering the advanced passive design in 
1984 while designing a major japanese reactor with a lot of 
improved safety features slember said what really made sense 
was to go back to the basics and start with a clean piece of paper

sir peter walters chairman of british petroleum 
plc plans to retire march 10 and will be succeeded by the former 
head of bp america inc the company announced thursday 
british petroleum the worlds thirdlargest oil concern in sales 
after exxon corp and royal dutch shell group said robert horton 
will replace walters as chairman horton 50 former chief executive 
of british petroleums us subsidiary based in cleveland ohio was 
appointed deputy chairman on march 1 
walters 58 has been managing director of the company for 17 
years and chairman since 1981 he was knighted in 1984 
he had been poised to step down this year and take over as 
chairman of national westminster bank but could not come to terms 
with the bank he resigned from bps board in august 
earlier this year walters drew criticism within the company for 
accepting a 48 percent increase in his compensation to 514558 
pounds or about 800000 at current exchange rates 
when he became chairman in 1981 walters said he hoped to 
restructure the company within 10 years and then retire 
his first moves were to sharply reduce bps refining capacity in 
europe turning a 1 billionayear loss to a 1 billion profit 
within four years 
since the start of the decade bps european refining capacity 
has been cut by 57 percent 
horton was in charge of cutting losses in bp chemicals 
international group 
during walters term bp acquired the outstanding 45 percent 
minority interest of standard oil for 78 billion in 1987 and 
undertook the 25billionpoundtakeover about 4 billion of 
britoil last year 
the full takeover of standard oil has allowed bp to integrate its 
us operations under bp america and to call off a disastrous 
exploration program that cost standard billions of dollars half of 
bps assets are now in the united states 
the acquisition of britoil gave bp a major stake in the north sea 
as a hedge against declining production although the company has 
said it can maintain production of 17 million barrels a day until 
the mid1990s its two main oil fields forties in the north sea and 
prudhoe bay in alaska have both peaked 
walters a native of birmingham in central england joined bp in 
1954 and was involved mainly with the companys international oil 
supply organization including assignments to the new york office in 
196062 and as vicepresident of bp north america inc in 196567 
in 1971 he was appointed bps regional director for the western 
hemisphere australasia and far east he was named deputy chairman 
in 1980 
the company did not announce walters plans following retirement 
horton joined bp in 1957 and was appointed general manager of 
the bp tanker co in 1975 the next year he was appointed general 
manager of bp groups corporate planning department 
in 1980 he became chief executive officer of bp chemicals 
international he was elected to the board in december 1983 as a 
managing director with responsibility for finance planning and the 
western hemisphere 
he resigned from british petroleum in 1986 to become chairman and 
chief executive officer of standard oil following the merger of bp 
and standard in 1987 he was appointed chief executive officer of bp 
america 
in february british petroleum reported that aftertax profit in 
1988 fell 13 percent to 121 billion pounds on an historical cost 
basis from 139 billion pounds in 1987 
current cost aftertax profit rose 10 percent to 144 billion 
pounds or about 255 billion from 131 billion pounds pershare 
earnings declined to 20 pence or 35 cents from 249 pence 
sales for the year fell 8 percent to 259 billion pounds from 
283 billion pounds a year earlier

as american kids grow bored with video games and 
stop buying them toy companies are hoping to pick up the slack by 
importing the latest craze from japan 6inch model cars that move 
at the equivalent when scaled up to full size of 320 miles per 
hour 
but executives who gathered in boston for a toy industry 
conference thursday expressed one nagging doubt about their new 
hyper cars the darn things move so fast how can kids possibly 
play with them 
its a real problem conceded kenneth a bloom vice 
president for finance at matchbox international ltd you put it 
down on the rug and let it go and its just going to shoot off and 
keep going until it hits something or flips over 
the 5 to 12 cars powered by two or three aa batteries move at 
actual speeds of about 10 miles per hour but in comparison with 
their scale which is 132 of a fullsized car they easily outrun 
formula i racers 
matchbox and its major competitors hasbro inc mattel inc and 
tonka corp plan to spend a total of 20 million to 25 million by 
christmas to promote the flashy vehicles most of which are just now 
hitting retail stores 
its an unusually late product introduction for the industry and 
a marketing gamble driven by equal parts of excitement and worry 
at the international toy fair in new york in january when new 
products traditionally are unveiled mattel and tonka displayed 
their superfast cars but were virtually ignored by retailers 
since then however two things have happened 
one is that the cars have taken off in japan selling an 
estimated 45 million units and whetting the appetites of american 
toy store chains 
the other is that the 2 billionayear market for video games 
may have peaked and no hot new toys have emerged since cabbage 
patch dolls and the board game trivial pursuit racked up hundreds of 
millions of dollars in sales in the mid1980s 
stephen o shank tonka corps chief executive officer told the 
boston toy conference that he expects an orderly decline in 
video game sales starting next year and tonka has decided to drop 
its sega video line in 1990 
the last time there was a downturn in video games in 198081 
several toy companies profits plunged and it got pretty bloody 
out there said steve eisenberg a toy industry analyst for the 
investment firm of bear stearns amp co the conferences sponsor 
to avoid such a debacle again toymakers have been casting about 
for something with enough sparkle to pull parents and children back 
into the toy stores 
the industry has lacked a hot product for two years and 
everyone thinks this hyper car thing could be it said bruno 
ferretti president of tons of toys a chain of 25 stores in the 
northeast 
the cars come in numerous designs inclding some with 
interchangeable motors and gear boxes although they are being 
marketed under various names such as hyperdrivers and record 
breakers most versions are made in japan and are nearly identical 
in construction 
toymakers hope to solve the problem of how to play with the 
speeding vehicles by selling plastic track that kids can put 
together in their bedrooms garages or backyards in japan arcades 
have installed elaborate tracks that junior racers pay to use but 
some toy executives are doubtful the same thing will happen in 
america 
tyco toys inc the leading maker of slot cars and 
radiocontrolled vehicles has decided to sit out the craze 
we dont think its a good product we dont think it has good 
play value and we dont think its going to be successful tyco 
president richard e grey told the industry conference were 
prepared to be wrong but were also willing to stand up and be 
counted

rjr nabisco inc said thursday it would sell the 
fresh fruit operations of del monte to the british conglomerate 
polly peck international plc for 875 million in another major step 
toward reducing debt from its record buyout 
the cash sale of del monte tropical fruit co moves rjr past the 
halfway mark in its efforts to sell about 55 billion in assets to 
reduce the debt accumulated in the 25 billion buyout of the food 
and tobacco giant by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
del monte is the worlds largest supplier of fresh pineapples and 
no 3 in bananas its acquisition would make polly peck a major 
player in the fresh fruit industry by allowing it to use the 
wellknown del monte brand name on its entire range of produce 
rjrs plan to divest assets particularly among its food 
holdings began in june when it sold five european food businesses 
for 25 billion to bsn sa of france and its chun king unit for 52 
million to a singapore syndicate the following month it sold its 
biscuit and food businesses in india and pakistan for 44 million 
we are significantly ahead of schedule in completing that 
plan said rjr chairman louis v gerstner 
rjr said the amount received for the fresh fruit business was 
about 13 times the units projected 1989 operating income a price 
tag generally in line with analysts expectations 
id say its a good price of course its not as good as what 
they extracted from the european snack food operations said 
marc i cohen of the new york securities firm sanford c bernstein 
john maxwell an analyst with wheat first securities in richmond 
va said he expected rjr to proceed with plans to sell the rest of 
del monte as well including del monte foods usa and separate units 
in europe latin america canada and the far east 
he predicted the remainder of the division would fetch between 
15 billion and 2 billion 
del monte tropical fruit with 600 million in sales of 
pineapples bananas papayas mangoes and other fresh fruits last 
year accounted for about a quarter of del montes total sales 
rjr had total revenue of 744 billion for the first six months 
of 1989 
gerstner acknowledged rjr already has received inquiries about 
acquiring other del monte businesses but there has been no final 
decision yet

soybean futures prices posted strong gains 
thursday on the chicago board of trade boosted by perceptions of 
increased foreign demand for us soy products and by a private crop 
analysts bullish harvest forecast 
grain futures closed mixed 
the export news came from three directions beginning with the 
agriculture departments announcement late wednesday that 200000 
metric tons of us soybeans had been sold to unknown destinations 
traders speculated the beans were bound for china russia or japan 
rumors that the usda would grant pakistan 80 million in credit 
to purchase us soybean oil prompted further buying in the soybean 
complex as did talk that a vegetable oil sale to the soviet union 
was in the works 
the soybean market also was supported by new crop estimates by 
sparks commodities inc a memphis tennbased analytical firm 
that were lower than the agriculture departments august projections 
sparks pegged the 1989 us soybean crop at 185 billion bushels 
compared with the usdas 191 billionbushel estimate 
sparks projected the corn harvest at 713 billion bushels 
compared with the usdas august estimate of 735 billion 
the usda will revise its crop estimates on tuesday 
if sparks estimates prove correct soybean prices may be headed 
for an extended stay above 6 a bushel said pat oconnell a grain 
market analyst with refco inc in chicago 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents lower to 1 cents 
higher with september at 397 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 
cents higher with september at 236 a bushel oats were cent to

us agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter met on thursday with european community officials but 
appeared to make little headway in solving some tough problems 
separating the giant trading partners 
both sides reported the talks were constructive but neither 
indicated any moves to settle their disputes over european 
agricultural subsidies and a european ban on imports of 
hormonetreated beef from the united states 
even so yeutter told reporters he was mildly encouraged that 
the current round of international trade negotiations could be 
wrapped up on schedule by the end of 1990 those talks called the 
uruguay round are being held under the auspices of the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
earlier ray macsharry the top agricultural official for the 
european community raised the possibility that the two sides 
dispute over the trading blocs ban on beef from cattle treated with 
growth hormones might be easing 
the united states has refused to comply with the prohibition 
arguing the hormones used by its farmers are safe it has retaliated 
with stiff duties on some european imports 
macsharry said more than 200 feedlots in the united states and 
about 10 slaughterhouses have been approved to ship hormonefree 
beef to the 12 nations of the community a major packing company 
also has shown in interest in gaining approval for its products he 
said 
the recent shipments of hormonefree beef would amount to about 
9 million if stretched out over 12 months according to community 
estimates 
as a result macsharry said he expected an easing of the us 
sanctions shortly 
yeutter however described the recent shipments of highquality 
beef as nominal and said they did not include the lower grades which 
make up about 80 percent or 85 percent of the disputed meat sent to 
the community 
weve still only solved about 15 percent of the problem he 
said 
yeutter also said governments should wait for the results of 
scientific studies on another hormone bovine somatatropin or bst 
before deciding whether to ban its use bst boosts the milk yield of 
a cow 
macsharry has proposed that the community hold off making a 
decision on the hormone until the end of 1990 
the united states the european community and other nations are 
tackling agricultural policies as part of the uruguay round talks 
a sticking point has been an american demand for the community to 
get rid of import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies 
that it says distort trade 
to do that the united states has suggested to gatt that steps be 
taken to convert subsidies or other trade barriers into tariffs so 
that these duties could then be negotiated to lower levels the idea 
is to quantify the restrictions in order to reduce them 
macsharry said that plan was of major concern to us 
if such action were taken to reduce support for european farmers 
he said the community would have to look at ways of slapping 
tariffs on an enormous amount of products that now enter the 
trading bloc duty free 
yeutter in turn said the united states was vigorously 
opposed to those tariff adjustments known as rebalancing 
what is proposed by the community constitutes increased 
protectionism rather than icreased trade liberalization he said 
yeutter was scheduled to travel to switzerland and germany before 
returning to the united states

government farm programs must encourage 
alternative methods of food production that save the soil and use 
fewer chemical fertilizers weedkillers and pesticides a national 
research council report said thursday 
federal farm policies have generally made a plentiful food 
supply a higher priority than protection of the nations soil and 
water resources the report said 
instead of supporting environmentally benign ways of 
producing food the report said government programs have worked 
against those alternative methods 
linda worthington a coordinator for americans for a safe food a 
subsidiary of the private nonprofit center for science in the 
public interest said she agreed with the reports charge that 
government farm policies have been an impediment 
some of the basic agricultural policies that have been in 
motion almost since world war ii have pushed the american farmer 
into a highchemical method of farming and makes it difficult if 
not impossible for the farmer to move into more sustainable 
practices she said 
worthingtons group earlier this year released a study showing 
that efforts to promote organic and lowchemical farming is 
flourishing at the state level while the federal effort is moving 
slowly 
the latest report alternative agriculture came after a 
threeyear 625000 study by a 17member committee headed by john 
pesek of iowa state university the council is an agency of the 
national academies of sciences and engineering 
as used in the 450page report alternative agriculture is not a 
single system of farm production with a siple list of dos and 
donts it is a generic term that includes a wide range of 
methodology and labels organic biological lowinput 
regenerative sustainable 
the usda uses its own acronym lisa for lowinput sustainable 
agriculture in a bid to help farmers find lowercost ways of 
producing crops and livestock while helping protect the environment 
assistant secretary charles e hess said at usda that congress 
has already authorized a number of program changes to give more 
choices to farmers and that flexibility will be an important part of 
drafting a 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985 law 
hess told reporters that the agriculture department also has 
expanded its work in ipm or integrated pest management which uses 
a variety of methods to control crop pests instead of the old 
practice of dousing fields with pesticides 
the report recommended that the department boost its spending on 
lisa to at least 40 million a year from the current level of 445 
million hess said the total usda research budget is about 12 
billion this year and that a substantial upgrading of that is under 
review 
hess acknowledged that there has been a major step forward in 
the last five years in the recognition of alternative farm 
methods this has been a shared repsonsibility of usda the 
landgrant universities and congress he said 
only a few of the nations 217 million farms have adopted entire 
alternative systems of production but the report said the need is 
there and that bits and pieces have been successfully used 
hess said there is no magic formula and the practices will 
vary from farm to farm 
crop rotations in which soilbuilding crops are grown after the 
production of corn or other grain for several years are examples of 
alternative methods the conventional method might call for the same 
crop year after year with farmers heaping on costly chemicals to 
boost production 
many federal policies discourage adoption of alternative 
practices and systems by economically penalizing those who adopt 
rotations apply certain soil conservation systems or attempt to 
reduce pesticide applications the report said 
federal programs often tolerate and sometimes encourage 
unrealistically high yield goals inefficient fertilizer and 
pesticide use and unsustainable use of land and water it said 
many farmers in these programs manage their farms to maximize 
present and future program benefits sometimes at the expense of 
environmental quality 
a primary goal of commodity program reform should be the 
removal of the existing disincentives that discourage alternative 
methods of production 
this step would ensure that farmers who employ crop rotations 
and recommended resource conservation practices are not deprived of 
farmincome support the report said 
thus it added congress would have to revise existing programs 
to eliminate penalties for farmers adopting crop rotations and to 
allow more flexibility in substituting or adjusting acreage 
allotments to accommodate rotations 
the american farmland trust a nonprofit conservation group 
based in washington said the report documents the compatibility 
of economic concerns and conservation measures on the nations 
farms 
today many farmers successfully implement safe sustainable 
agricultural practices said ralph grossi aft president 
however there is no widespread coordination of these efforts 
the study was financed mainly by a 410000 grant from the wk 
kellogg foundation other private contributors put up the balance 
and the usda provided 80000

senate majority leader george j mitchell said 
thursday he will vigorously oppose a capitalgains tax cut which he 
called a giveaway to the rich that would have to be financed by 
middleincome taxpayers 
mitchell said he favors preferential tax treatment for capital 
gains but only as part of a fair progressive tax structure that 
would include raising the maximum tax rate paid by wealthier 
americans on all types of income 
the present proposal is unfair unwise and will increase the 
deficit mitchell dmaine told reporters it will require 
middleclass taxpayers to make up that tax break for the wealthy 
mitchell cited estimates that on average a capitalgains 
reduction would be worth 31000 a year to a person with income over 
200000 
the house ways and means committee is expected to approve a 
capitalgains cut next week 
until passage of the 1986 tax overhaul capital gains which are 
profits from the sale of stock and other investments were taxed at 
a lower rate than other income but the capitalgains preference 
as well as such breaks as deductions for sales taxes and universal 
individual retirement accounts was taken away so that tax rates on 
all kinds of income could be cut significantly 
president bush promised during the campaign last year to restore 
the preference for capital gains arguing such action would spur 
investment and saving he has asked congress to cut the maximum 
capitalgains rate now 33 percent to 15 percent 
a compromise reduction which has the presidents support was 
proposed by rep ed jenkins dga it would cut the top rate for 2 
years to 20 percent then raise it permanently to 28 percent and 
ensure that profits caused solely by inflation would not be taxed 
jenkins plan has the backing of a bare majority of the house 
ways and means committee but the panels democratic leadership has 
delayed a vote in an effort to win support for a third plan 
offered by rep dan rostenkowski dill the new proposal would 
index the value of investments so that inflationcaused gain 
would not be taxed but it would go a big step further for assets 
held for five or more years exempting from taxation as much as half 
the price for which such an investment is sold 
mitchell said that because of the budget deficit this is not the 
time to consider any cut in capitalgains taxes asked if he is 
prepared to go to the mat in opposition to a cut he stomped his 
foot and replied yes 
he said that if a preference is voted for capital gains that 
would increase pressure to restore other breaks that were taken away 
in the 1986 overhaul 
coincidentally sens alfonse damato rny and christopher 
dodd dconn introduced a bill thursday that would restore 
slightly modified but fully deductible iras for all workers a 
worker regardless of income could avoid tax on up to 2000 per 
year contributed to an ira one with an unemployed spouse could 
contribute another 1000 
the worker would be allowed a tax credit for 15 percent of the 
ira contribution thus one who made the maximum 2000 contribution 
could save 300 in taxes 
the 1986 law retained fully deductible iras only for those not 
covered by a company pension regardless of income and couples 
earning less than 35000 and single workers earning less than 
25000

the head of fluorocarbon co who felt like a 
corporate al capone because people wrongly thought his products 
zapped the ozone layer said thursday hes received more than 9000 
entries in his contest to rename the company 
the safesounding suggestions from fluoroseals to notox to 
proozone inc to oat bran co came in letters from points as 
farflung as stuttgart west germany to a couple of us jails said 
peter churm chairman of the laguna niguelbased company 
one of the jailbirds was in san diego and one was in the 
cleveland pokey churm said the guy from the san diego county 
jail apologized that he couldnt have it typed 
churm decided to rename fluorocarbon this year after brokers 
balked at pitching the stock to investors 
the problem a lot of people confused fluorocarbon with 
chlorofluorocarbons the compounds that are believed to erode the 
ozone layer that screens cancercausing ultraviolet rays 
in fact the smallish company 250 million in 1988 sales makes 
custom seals gaskets bearings and the like from teflon and related 
plastics known as fluorocarbons whirlpool corp boeing co and 
navistar international are among churms customers and fluorocarbon 
seals are even used in the space shuttle 
the deadline for postmarked entries was aug 31 so churm figured 
nearly all of them had arrived by thursday 
as of this morning weve had 3647 letters with somewhere 
between 9000 and 10000 suggestions altogether he said 
some suggestions were silly not chlorofluorocarbon inc 
fiberfab seals r us fluoraluralura 
and any with american laguna or my name will be instantly 
eliminated churm said 
there went the churminators inc and laguna buna 
a committee headed by churm will winnow the entries to 10 in the 
next couple of weeks then the lawyers will get busy starting with 
the first name until they find one that isnt yet taken by another 
company the winner should be announced by late october 
the prize is 100 shares of fluorocarbon stock which has been 
trading at about 16 per share 
well do something special for the winner churm said 
the flood of entries became so huge this summer after the great 
name change was announced that fluorocarbon assigned two workers to 
the contest one hired temporarily to feed names into a computer 
most employees will be glad when its over 
its been a bit overwhelming churm said were set up to 
be a manufacturing company not some pr firm

white house economic adviser michael j boskin 
on thursday reinforced the bush administrations call on the federal 
reserve board to lower interest rates 
my own personal view is if there are signs of softness in the 
economy from where we are now that further easing would probably be 
appropriate said boskin chairman of the council of economic 
advisers 
we see the economy is continuing to grow albeit at a slower 
rate than the fairly rapid pace of 1987 and 1988 he said 
his remarks at a us chamber of commerce breakfast came three 
weeks after white house budget director richard darman complained 
that the central bank was keeping interest rates too high and would 
have to bear the blame if the country toppled into a recession after 
nearly seven years of economic expansion 
president bush later endorsed darmans statement calling it 
very balanced 
boskin has generally avoided publicly criticizing the federal 
reserve which is considered an independent branch of government 
and his statement was muted compared to darmans remarks 
picking fights between the administration and the fed is the 
best game in town and i dont really intend to get involved i think 
thats counterproductive boskin said 
im sure the fed is monitoring the data as closely as we are 
and im certain they will adopt a sensible monetary policy because 
they themselves have said that their goal is to try to achieve the 
maximum sustainable economic growth consistent with controlling 
inflation he said 
beginning in march 1988 the central bnk boosted shortterm 
interest rates by 3 percentage points its goal was a socalled 
soft landing slower but continued economic growth that would 
prevent an acceleration of inflation 
then when signs of sluggishness began to emerge the fed in june 
began loosening credit allowing rates to fall by about 
threequarters of a percentage point 
however recent statistics indicate the economy although slower 
than last year was doing better than most economists thought the 
fed has not nudged interest rates down further since midjuly 
causing some impatience within the administration which is 
depending on continued growth to generate tax revenue and help it 
reduce the budget deficit without a tax increase 
we would not be satisfied with a definition of soft landing 
that merely avoids a recession boskin said the economy can and 
should do better than that it should sustain growth sufficient to 
provide rising employment and real income to americans

a bankruptcy judge on thursday pulled 
former ohio financier marvin warners case out of liquidation and 
restored it to chapter 11 reorganization so creditors can decide on 
a proposed 16 million settlement 
the creditors are expected to vote on the plan within the next 
few weeks and us ankrutpcy judge george proctor scheduled a sept 
27 hearing in orlando to confirm the tally 
the judge approved a motion to return warners case to chapter 11 
protection from the liquidation hed ordered on july 31 saying 
the court does not plan to throw a monkey wrench in the proposed 
settlement filed earlier this week in court

three annual 2 million payments beginning with the first 
anniversary of the plans approval warner also will pay all legal 
fees and administrative costs and an estimated 2 million in taxes 
associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement 
warner 70 has been the target of a flood of lawsuits following 
the collapse of his cincinnatibased home state savings bank in 
march 1985 he filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in october 
1987 against creditors seeking more than 45 billion 
warner was convicted on ohio felony charges in home states 
collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial 
he is appealing the state conviction and a restitution order 
home state collapsed four days after fort lauderdalebased esm 
government securities inc was shut down by federal regulators for 
insolvency home state had invested heavily with esm through 
securities trades and lost 144 million when esm was closed 
the creditors most of whom have already agreed to the 
settlement will formally vote on the plan before attending the 
hearing in orlando

by all classes of creditors and whether it meets the requirements of 
the bankruptcy law if that is the case he will sign an order

defense lawyers portray a former new york 
federal reserve bank director who admitted leaking secret data as a 
generous country banker seduced into the crime by a friend 
a memorandum submitted wednesday to the judge preparing to 
sentence robert a rough described the exbanker as a man shattered 
by betraying his trust 
his attorneys asked for probation and a sentence of 200 hours of 
community service at newton memorial hospital where the 50yearold 
man would be willing to perform the most demeaning manual tasks 
us district judge dickinson r debevoise could impose up to 
five years in prison at sentencing sept 13 the government has 
recommended no more than one year 
rough while president of the national bank of sussex county sat 
on the board of the new york federal reserve bank from 1982 to 1984 
in a plea agreement with the government last june he admitted 
regularly disclosing advance word on new york fed recommendations to 
the federal reserve bank in washington regarding the discount rate 
several times he revealed actual fed decisions on the rate 
federal authorities called the case the first to involve insider 
trading of government securities and the first such charges against 
a director in the fed system 
the discount rate which is the interest the fed charges on loans 
to member banks can have a powerful effect on the securities market 
rough gave the information to principals of the nowdefunct 
brokerage firm bevill bresler amp schulman inc and the government 
claims they used it to reap millions in profits and avoid losses 
five top executives including company president gilbert c 
schulman who was roughs neighbor and friend were implicated in 
the firms 1985 collapse and sent to prison 
schulman was described in the defense attorneys memo as a 
nefarious individual wellknown to this court the consummate 
flimflam artist 
the memo said schulman saw roughs position on the new york feds 
board as a chance to profit 
accordingly schulman constantly prodded poked cajoled and 
pleaded with rough to reveal discountrate data the memo said 
in his own statement to debevoise rough blamed his actions on 
misguided notions of friendship the rationalization that 
the discount rate was a market follower and the fact that 11 other 
regional banks made recommendations 
but assistant us attorney paul weissman who handled the case 
argued nobody twisted his arm it was roughs decision to reveal 
the information 
weissman in his memo had called roughs actions serious 
criminal behavior by someone who grossly abused his position 
the government charged that rough was given 47000 in 
interestdeferred loans in exchange for the information but added 
in its memo that rough probably didnt see the loans as a payback 
only as unrelated personal loans from schulman 
along with roughs apologies to fed officials and admission that 
he abused his trust roughs memo detaile how he has seen his 
entire world crumble before his eyes

senate taxwriters yielding to loud complaints 
from many older americans indicated thursday they would join their 
house counterparts and go along with major changes in medicare 
insurance covering the costs of a catastrophic illness 
several members of the senate finance committee however 
rejected a revision approved by the house ways and means committee 
to cut costs for the higherincome elderly but raise them for older 
people with lower incomes 
i want to make it clear at the outset that as chairman i will 
oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees of modest 
means said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who heads the finance 
committee 
we should neither repeal catastrophic coverage nor shift 
a greater share of costs to beneficiaries who can least afford 
them said sen spark matsunaga dhawaii 
meanwhile republican congressional leaders met with president 
bush at the white house sen pete domenici rnm told reporters 
afterward that several of the lawmakers told bush the catastrophic 
care act ought to be repealed in toto 
the program enacted barely a year ago is under heavy fire from 
some older americans who say they dont need the protection and from 
others mainly those with higher incomes who object that the 
coverage is financed only by the elderly and not by all taxpayers 
about twothirds of the cost of the catastrophic care insurance 
program is paid by the 41 percent of older citizens whose incomes 
are high enough that they owe federal income tax of more than 150 
they pay a surtax of 15 percent on income tax above 150 about 18 
million of the 33 million medicare beneficiaries will pay the 
maximum surtax of 800 this year 
the surtax rate is due to increase to 28 percent and the maximum 
surtax to 1050 by 1993 
the rest of the cost is financed through a flat fee of 4 per 
month per retiree that fee is due to rise to 1020 by 1993 
complaints from the elderly prompted the ways and means committee 
to reduce some catastrophic care benefits cut the surtax rate by 
half and raise the flat monthly fee significantly those changes 
have not been enough to mollify the protesters as rep dan 
rostenkowski dill the ways and means chairman learned he was 
chased down a street in his hometown of chicago by angry retirees 
last month 
you almost have a sense when you go home of being unwanted 
unloved and unappreciated on this issue sen robert packwood 
rore told colleagues thursday 
the finance committee is likely to begin voting on how to change 
the program friday 
the bush administration said it would prefer no change at all 
but william diefenderfer deputy director of the office of 
management and budget conceded that doesnt seem to be whats 
going to happen 
diefenderfer noted that repeal of catastrophic care coverage 
would worsen the federal deficit in 1990 by as much as 7 billion 
because taxes earmarked for the program come in faster than benefits 
are paid out killing the program would automatically trigger 
acrosstheboard cuts in most federal spending 
there is considerable support in the house for outright repeal of 
catastrophic care insurance an idea that drew the support of sen 
john c danforth rmo 
i question the kind of commitment we made last year he said 
noting the program leans toward longterm hospital care 
this isnt something they older americans want danforth 
said its something they fear being hooked up to 
lifesupport equipment and the like 
the finance committee staff outlined seven options for changing 
catastrophic care coverage most of which would require retirees to 
pay a larger share of expenses but also allow them to reject the 
insurance but only if they also drop medicare part b which covers 
physicians fees 
the panel has two basic proposals for changing the way the 
program is financed 
freeze the surtax rate at 10 or 15 percent and reduce the 
maximum annual surtax to 585 this would require retirees to 
continue paying most of the costs of coverage 
require nonretirees to pay a share of the cost of catastrophic 
insurance by raising to 60000 the 48000 maximum amount of wages 
subject to the 145 percent medicare hospitalization tax the tax 
paid as part of the social security tax through payroll deductions 
is matched by the employer

investor donald trump has received government 
clearance to purchase more than 15 million of the jewelry firm

mr trump thinks that tiffany is a very exciting company that 
represents a good investment opportunity said susan heilbron 
spokeswoman for the trump organization 
she declined to disclose whether trump already owns any tiffany 
shares or how large a stake he contemplates acquiring 
tiffany issued a brief news release in which chairman william r 
chaney said trump had advised him that a filing was made to the 
government so that trump might acquire and hold more than 15 
million of tiffanys stock as an investment and not as part of a 
takeover effort 
tiffanys stock recently has gone up amid takeover speculation 
and talk on wall street that the stock was being accumulated 
responding to the rumors tiffany released a statement on aug 25 
saying it hadnt received any takeover offers and wasnt seeking any 
trump whose holdings include hotels casinos and an airline 
hadnt been mentioned as a potential tiffany suitor he hasnt made 
any filings to the securities and exchange commission involving 
tiffany which would be required if he owned 5 percent or more of 
the companys stock 
tiffany stock rallied on news of trumps interest it closed at 
6037 up 612 a share in composite new york stock exchange 
trading 
new yorkbased tiffany which owns tony jewelry stores in 
numerous cities and a flagship store on fifth avenue adjacent to the 
trump tower building was founded in 1837 by charles lewis tiffany 
it was acquired by cosmetics company avon products inc in 1979

from avon for 1355 million in may 1987 tiffany made an initial

percent from 68 million or 44 cents a share a year earlier 
sales in 1989s first half rose 35 percent to 159 million from

which generally requires advance notification of stock or asset 
acquisitions if a purchase would result in an acquirer holding 15 
percent or more of the voting stock of a company or more than 15 
million worth of a companys voting stock

oil futures finished with small to moderate gains 
thursday as the recent rally in the energy markets appeared to 
weaken 
wholesale gasoline prices which spurted wednesday on reports of 
refinery fires maintained much of their upward momentum helped by 
a bullish weekly report on stocks 
but prices of crude oil and wholesale home heating oil ran into 
resistance 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract for october 
delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 052 cent to 5563 cents a 
gallon adding to wednesdays gain of 135 cents the november 
december and january contracts also moved up 
among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange 
the october contract of no2 heating oil edged 002 cent higher to 
5550 cents a gallon stabilizing after wednesdays jump of 091 
cent contracts for more distant months ended with minor gains 
the october contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil settled at 1941 per 42gallon barrel up 
13 cents from wednesday when the contract settled with an increase 
of 23 cents other delivery months closed with small losses and 
gains 
richard kane a vice president of energy futures trading at 
merrill lynch amp co said activity in the energy pits retained a 
positive tone even though some futures faltered 
the market seemed to stall in crude but continued strong for 
gasoline said kane on the day we saw a very good 
consolidation period 
prices for gasoline recently have benefited from concerns about 
possible tightening in supplies temporarily on wednesday a fire at 
shell oil cos martinez calif refinery and one at ashland 
petroleum cos refinery in st paul park minn added to the 
speculation 
after the close of business wednesday the american petroleum 
institute issued its weekly inventory statistics that were viewed as 
bullish for gasoline

and a 15 millionbarrel drawdown in crude stocks the drop in

an experimental vaccine for a venereal disease 
that kills unborn calves appears to be controlling the illness that 
causes an estimated 500 million in losses annually nationwide a 
researcher said thursday 
within the next two or three months well begin to get a much 
better idea of just how efficient this product is said bill 
kvasnicka nevada extension veterinarian but at this point 
everything points toward the fact that this is going to be an 
extremely good vaccine for use in the field 
we see it as a major breakthrough to controlling this disease 
the vaccine for the sexually transmitted trichomoniasis is now 
available in 41 states under conditional license from the us 
department of agriculture researchers estimate the vaccine reduces 
the incidence of trichomoniasis by more than 90 percent 
kvasnicka mark hall a microbiologist at the university of 
nevada school of medicine and don hanks department chair at unrs 
veterinary medicine department began developing the vaccine a few 
years ago 
nevadas cattlemen asked us to develop something because so 
many cattle were infected with this disease said kvasnicka 
citing statistics that 441 percent of nevada cattle tested positive 
for the disease in 1987 
adult cows dont show symptoms of the disease when infected with 
trichomoniasis thats spread during breeding but cows with the 
illness can become infertile abort or their fetuses die kvasnicka 
said 
vaccinated cows tested so far in nevada are clearing the 
trichomoniasis disease within weeks and there appears to be no 
embryonic damages kvasnicka said 
its really amazing he said but were still measuring the 
impact on whether we can save the embryos 
researchers are scheduled next week to check on a couple of 
nevada cattle herds that have been vaccinated to determine whether 
the disease has killed any unborn calves 
a key test will come in october when we test the cattle after 
120 days of pregnancy he said but were pretty optimistic 
because the disease appears to have the biggest effect in the 30 to 
60 day period of pregnancy 
cows have a 282day gestation period 
an acutely infected herd can lose up to 40 percent of its calves 
while one that has been carrying the disease for years can lose as 
many as 10 percent of its unborn calves kvasnicka said 
if the vaccine is proven safe kvasnicka said the usda is 
planning by jan 1 to decide whether to fully license the product 
that was refined by fort dodge laboratories 
in the early 1980s researchers in australia studied the disease 
developing a vaccine for bulls but hall said that didnt stop the 
disease 
the problem with that approach is that if one bull in a herd 
fails to develop immunity and becomes infected he passes the 
disease to every heifer he breeds he explained that is not a 
good way to go we need to protect the whole herd

futures prices for frozen pork bellies soared the 2centsapound 
daily limit thursday on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
speculation that americas belly surplus could disappear in a 
package of food aid to poland 
on other markets soybean futures posted strong gains while 
energy futures and precious metals futures were mixed 
frozen pork belly futures settled 2 cents higher across the board 
with the contract for delivery in february at 4682 cents a pound 
the rally helped lift livestock futures contracts live cattle 
settled 12 cent to 55 cent higher with october at 7270 cents a 
pound feeder cattle were 30 cent to 58 cent higher with october 
at 8205 cents a pound live hogs were 03 cent lower to 40 cent 
higher with october at 3975 cents a pound 
the february porkbelly contract has risen about 21 percent in 
value since aug 1 when february bellies traded as low as 3870 
cents a pound 
most of the gains have occurred in the past week on hopes that 
some of the nearrecord supplies of bellies languishing in deep 
freeze will be given to poland along with other us commodities 
we probably will end up shipping bellies to poland said dale 
durchholz a livestockmarket analyst with agrivisor services inc 
in bloomington ill the question is how many and when 
a pork belly is the part of a pig from which bacon is made 
the agriculture departments last count showed 964 million 
pounds of pork bellies in cold storage as of aug 1 the largest 
supply for that date since the record year of 1971 
analysts say the resulting drop in bacon prices has led to 
greater consumption and a more rapid movement of bellies out of 
freezers so that the usdas sept 22 coldstorage report is 
expected to show 55 million to 60 million pounds in cold storage as 
of sept 1 
when talk of a polish porkbelly shipment first surfaced last 
week traders were speculating the amount would be about 30 million 
pounds 
on wednesday a financial news service reported the poles were 
seeking 50000 metric tons or more than 110 million pounds each of 
bellies and beef 
us officials have been cautious in their statements about a 
possible shipment on thursday christopher goldthwait an assistant 
administrator with the usdas foreign agriculture service said it 
was premature to talk about quantities or even about what 
commodities may be included in an aid package 
durchholz said the market may be overreacting but he conceded 
the us belly surplus no longer looked so enormous 
when i start looking at the numbers being batted around all of 
a sudden youre saying that what was an overabundance is not 
necessarily so he said 
soybean futures prices reached twoweek highs on the chicago 
board of trade boosted by perceptions of increased foreign demand 
for us soy products and by a bullish harvest forecast from 
memphis tennbased sparks commodities inc 
sparks pegged the 1989 us soybean crop at 185 billion bushels 
compared with the usdas august estimate of 191 billion bushels 
the usda will revise its crop estimates on tuesday 
if sparks is right soybean prices could be headed for an 
extended stay above 6 a bushel said pat oconnell a grain market 
analyst with refco inc in chicago 
soybeans settled 4 cents to 9 cents higher with september at 
596 a bushel wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1 cents 
higher with september at 397 a bushel corn was 1 cent lower to 1 
cent higher with september at 236 a bushel oats were cent to 2

seven large companies will offer athome 
emergency child care to more than 13000 employees in a yearlong 
experiment in daycare assistance 
the employees will qualify for emergency assistance in a variety 
of situations that typically force parents to stay home from work 
when a child becomes ill and cannot go to school when the familys 
regular child care arrangements fall through or when a parent is 
suddenly called away on business an employee will be entitled to 
use the service up to three consecutive days 
this is a perfect example of what i have in mind when i write 
about the concept of the familyfriendly workplace edward f 
zigler a yale professor and a longtime advocate of a national child 
care policy told the new york times in a story published thursday 
the seven companies all in new york are home box office 
colgatepalmolive national westminster bank usa the time inc 
magazine co the accounting firm ernst amp young the electric 
utility consolidated edison co and skadden arps slate meagher amp 
flom new york citys largest law firm 
a mixture of bottomline profit considerations and concern for 
employees spurred companies to create the program officials said 
we no longer live in communities where there are extended 
families or where we even know our neighbors so parents have no 
backup systems said karol rose manager of the work and family 
program at time 
when an employee doesnt come to work or leaves a child in a 
situation he worries about it is stressful for the employee and 
costly for the employer 
five participating companies will pay the full cost of the care 
about 1050 an hour and the others will pay most of the cost with 
employees covering the balance 
some companies expect the program to cut costs because of the 
high cost of temporary workers for example home box office pays 
15 to 20 an hour to hire a temporary word processor said nancy 
platt a company spokeswoman

chemical giant du pont de nemours amp co has been 
ordered to stop selling two fungicides which were contaminated with 
an herbicide during manufacture the us environmental protection 
agency announced thursday 
the two fungicides benlate and tersan were contaminated with 
atrazine during manufacture by a subcontractor terra chemicals of 
blythe ark said spokesman pete bentley of the epa philadelphias 
office 
use of the tainted fungicides poses potential risks of plant 
injury and illegal residue on food crops the epa reported benlate 
is registered for use on ornamental plants and certain food crops 
while tersan is registered for turf and ornamental uses 
bentley said since atrazine is applied early in the growing 
season residue from the pesticide is not normally found on crops 
because of that tolerance standards for atrazine residue have not 
been established by the epa 
benlate however is applied later in the growing season and 
because of that atrazine residue could show up bentley said 
however the contamination does not pose a significant health 
threat he said 
the epa issues between 1000 and 2000 stopsale orders a year 
and the move is not considered unusual bentley said 
du pont spokesman sam waltz said most of the product has already 
been sold and the company initiated a voluntary recall last month 
the epa issued the stopsale order after receiving numerous 
complaints of plant injury nationwide bentley said because 
atrazine is an herbicide the contaminated benlate was killing some 
of the plants it was applied on

citing stock declines and losses 
exceeding 126 million a datapoint corp shareholder said thursday 
he is trying to oust takeover specialist asher b edelman as 
chairman and place his own nominees on the companys board 
i think the company needs a workout or turnaround philosophy 
rather than its present philosophy said martin s ackerman a new 
york attorney who tries to revive troubled companies 
ackerman filed papers with the securities and exchange commission 
on thursday stating why he believes edelman should be removed from 
datapoints board 
ackerman is awaiting sec clearance to submit a 25page proposal 
to datapoints estimated 4500 shareholders seeking their consent 
more than 40 percent of the computer companys stock is held by 46 
large institutions he said 
if the institutions think theyve had enough of edelman then 
ill win said ackerman who also is chairman and chief executive 
officer of authorized distribution network inc a new jerseybased 
computer sales and service company 
the motion should be put to the stockholders within 60 days he 
said 
edelman ousted datapoints longtime management in march 1985 he 
used some of datapoints liquid capital for investments mostly in 
bids to take over other corporations 
in the sec filing ackerman said a review of public information 
indicates that datapoints stock value has declined about 58 percent 
since edelman took over in 1985 a period in which the standard amp 
poors composite index increased 81 percent 
also according to ackerman from fiscal year 1985 to 1988 
datapoint suffered net losses exceeding 106 million and it had a 
203 million net loss for the nine months ending april 29 
he claims edelman used datapoint money for speculation in the 
securities of other companies and that edelman and his associates on 
the board were paid large fees by datapoint 
edelman did not immediately return a telephone call thursday 
seeking comment 
by law ackerman said he could only approach up to 10 datapoint 
stockholder institutions about his plans for the company and he has 
contacted eight so far all of them have encouraged us to go 
forward he said 
ackerman a datapoint stockholder since may said if he is 
successful in taking control of the datapoint board he would 
immediately halt the companys involvement in investing in the 
stocks of potential takeover targets 
he said datapoint needs to get back into computers and out of 
the raid and trade business 
datapoint has about 330 million in annual sales and employs 
2600 people 
it encountered trouble in the early 1980s because of a soft 
computer market a fight with stockholders who claimed in a lawsuit 
the company misled them and an inability to sell san antonio real 
estate and lease office space in datapointowned buildings

a delaware judge ruled thursday that chriscraft 
industries inc a major shareholder in warner communications inc 
has no power to veto the merger between warner and time warner inc 
chancery court judge william allen ruling in wilmington del 
said the terms of a class of preferred stock held by a chriscraft 
subsidiary bhc inc did not entitle chriscraft to vote on the 
merger of the two media giants 
allen ruled in response to a request for a declaration of 
chriscrafts rights by warner and time warner 
time inc completed a 14 billion tender offer for warner in 
july and then changed its name to time warner inc the companies 
merger is expected to be completed later this year 
a decision by allen later upheld by the delaware supreme court 
threw out a challenge to the merger by paramount communications 
inc which had sought to acquire time inc for 12 billion 
in his latest decision allen said that under the terms of the 
stock chriscraft does not possess a veto over every merger in 
which its interests would be adversely affected 
chriscraft contended it had a right to vote on the merger 
because its preferred warner shares can be converted into preferred 
time warner shares 
warner time warner and chriscraft have settled other parts of 
their dispute 
warner and chriscraft chairman herbert siegel have been feuding 
ever since chriscraft helped warner fend off an unwanted takeover 
bid from publisher rupert murdoch in 1984

plc two congressmen said thursday 
in a letter to reps neal smith diowa and harold rogers 
rky departing sec chairman david ruder said the agency would 
monitor the battle for londonbased bat which owns several major 
us companies although it lacked jurisdiction 
ruders response led the two lawmakers to issue a joint statement 
saying new legislation may now be needed to strenghten the secs 
ability to protect us shareholders 
the house is now much more likely to support legislation that 
would ensure that the sec does have jurisdiction to intervene in 
this and other highly leveraged offshore transactions said the 
two legislators 
but if the new sec chairman has different views on the issue 
they said or if the commission asserts jurisdiction as chairman 
ruder indicated they might do if an understanding of the facts 
changes new legislation may not be required 
ruder has said he will leave the sec at the end of the month 
president bush has nominated white house assistant richard breeden 
to succeed him 
goldsmiths consortium hoylake investments ltd launched a 21 
billion takeover bid for bat the worlds largest tobacco company 
in late july
